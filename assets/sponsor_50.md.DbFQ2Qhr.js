For example, in a multi-core processor, one core may replace the blocks fetched by other cores into shared cache, or prefetched blocks may replace demand-fetched blocks from the cache. Example Consider the following illustration: T[0] = T[0] + 1; for i in 0..sizeof(CACHE) C[i] = C[i] + 1; T[0] = T[0] + C[sizeof(CACHE)-1]; (The assumptions here are that the cache is composed of only one level, it is unlocked, the replacement policy is pseudo-LRU, all data is cacheable, the set associativity of the cache is N (where N > 1), and at most one processor register is available to contain program values). Right before the loop starts, T[0] will be fetched from memory into cache, its value updated. However, as the loop executes, because the number of data elements the loop references requires the whole cache to be filled to its capacity, the cache block containing T[0] has to be evicted. Thus, the next time the program requests T[0] to be updated, the cache misses, and the cache controller has to request the data bus to bring the corresponding cache block from main memory again. In this case the cache is said to be \\"polluted\\". Changing the pattern of data accesses by positioning the first update of T[0] between the loop and the second update can eliminate the inefficiency: for i in 0..sizeof(CACHE) C[i] = C[i] + 1; T[0] = T[0] + 1; T[0] = T[0] + C[sizeof(CACHE)-1]; Solutions Other than code-restructuring mentioned above, the solution to cache pollution is ensure that only high- reuse data are stored in cache. This can be achieved by using special cache control instructions, operating system support or hardware support. Examples of specialized hardware instructions include \\"lvxl\\" provided by PowerPC AltiVec. This instruction loads a 128 bit wide value into a register and marks the corresponding cache block as \\"least recently used\\" i.e. as the prime candidate for eviction upon a need to evict a block from its cache set. To appropriately use that instruction in the context of the above example, the data elements referenced by the loop would have to be loaded using this instruction. When implemented in this manner, cache pollution would not take place, since the execution of such loop would not cause premature eviction of T[0] from cache. This would be avoided because, as the loop would progress, the addresses of the elements in C would map to the same cache way, leaving the actually older (but not marked as \\"least recently used\\") data intact on the other way(s). Only the oldest data (not pertinent for the example given) would be evicted from cache, which T[0] is not a member of, since its update occurs right before the loop's start. Similarly, using operating system (OS) support, the pages in main memory that correspond to the C data array can be marked as \\"caching inhibited\\" or, in other words, non-cacheable. Similarly, at hardware level, cache bypassing schemesS. Mittal, \\"A Survey Of Cache Bypassing Techniques\\", JLPEA, 6(2), 2016 can be used which identify low-reuse data based on program access pattern and bypass them from cache. Also, shared cache can be partitioned to avoid destructive interference between running applications. The tradeoff in these solutions is that OS-based schemes may have large latency which may nullify the gain achievable by cache pollution avoidance (unless the memory region has been non-cacheable to begin with), whereas hardware-based techniques may not have a global view of the program control flow and memory access pattern. Increasing importance Cache pollution control has been increasing in importance because the penalties caused by the so-called \\"memory wall\\" keep on growing. Chip manufacturers continue devising new tricks to overcome the ever increasing relative memory-to-CPU latency. They do that by increasing cache sizes and by providing useful ways for software engineers to control the way data arrives and stays at the CPU. Cache pollution control is one of the numerous devices available to the (mainly embedded) programmer. However, other methods, most of which are proprietary and highly hardware and application specific, are used as well.

It was based on the Ford full-size car line available in each year. The Country Sedan was the mid-trim station wagon in the Ford range. Unlike the Country Squire, the Country Sedan featured plain body sides. As a full-size wagon, it could carry up to 9 passengers, if so equipped. The Country Sedan was based on the Customline from 1952 to 1954. Beginning in 1955, Ford spun their station wagons into their own series and the Country Sedan continued to represent the mid-trim level station wagon. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Country Sedan was approximate to the Galaxie and later the Galaxie 500 in trim elements. For 1972, 1973 and 1974 the model was marketed as the Galaxie 500 Country Sedan and from 1975 it was rebranded LTD wagon. By this time the trim level was identical to the Country Squire apart from the absence of simulated wood exterior paneling.

For the 1961 model year, Ford incorporated a tailgate assembly that featured a self-storing window that could either be rolled down into the gate via crank on the outside of the gate, or by an electrical motor actuated by the key or an interior switch. A safety lockout measure required that the rear window had to be fully retracted into the gate before it could be lowered. With the introduction of the 1966 models, all Ford wagons introduced the Magic Door Gate which allowed the tailgate on the vehicle to function as a traditional tailgate that could be lowered, or a door that swung outward for easier access to the seating area. The Magic Door Gate was made possible through a use of a traditional stationary hinge on the right, and a combination of hinges along the doors left side, which carried the weight of the gate as it swung outward when used as a door. General Motors, Chrysler, AMC, and Toyota would adopt a similar configuration by the end of the 1960s.

In the , Ellis Beach had a population of 24 people. Geography The five- kilometre strip of Ellis Beach is located aside the Coral Sea north of Cairns on the Captain Cook Highway between Cairns and Port Douglas, within the Cairns Region local government area. The Ellis Beach locality also contains the nearby off-shore Double Island, also known by its native Aboriginal name Wangal Djungay.  History  Ellis Beach is situated in the Djabugay (Tjapukai) traditional Aboriginal country. The Cairns Historical Society's records show that it was named after Dick Ellis, who at the time resided at this beach. He was a shot firer for the Queensland Department of Main Roads – presumably at the time the Cook Highway was constructed in the early 1930s. He lost a hand and the Queensland Government constructed a house for him at the beach now known as Ellis Beach on the spot where the café now stands. This was about 1940 and Dick Ellis died in 1960. Before World War II the area was unnamed (in English) and had no houses. It was only during the war years that it became known as Ellis Beach and this fits with all other records. There are a number of mango trees at Ellis Beach, which it is believed were tended by Mr Ellis. After the construction of the Cook Highway through the area the authorities decided to plant many varieties of trees along each side of the roadway. This was done where the terrain permitted. Mangoes were particularly suitable for this purpose and many of the original trees survive along with other flowering trees. Those along the stretch of road at Ellis Beach would no doubt owe their existence to Dick Ellis. In other areas drought and fire have taken their toll but some still exist. At the 2006 census, Ellis Beach had a population of 30. Amenities Ellis Beach is also home to the Ellis Beach Surf Lifesaving Club which regularly hosts competitions and events. From November to May, a stinger net patrolled by the club helps protect swimmers from marine \\"stingers\\" (jellyfish species of Chironex and Irukandji) which inhabit the waters during those months. Ellis Beach features pumice stones along its beautiful shores. There is a camping ground and a bar and grill restaurant. In popular culture Ellis Beach was featured in the fourth season of The Amazing Race.

Due to excessive size, the original list has been divided into separate articles, based on geographical locations. *Africa *Asia (exclusive of Japan) **Japan *Europe (exclusive of countries having separate lists) **Austria **Belarus **Belgium **Bulgaria **Croatia **Czech Republic **Denmark **Estonia **Finland **France **Germany **Greece **Hungary **Ireland **Italy **Latvia **Lithuania **Netherlands **Norway **Poland **Portugal **Romania **Russia **Serbia **Slovakia **Slovenia **Spain **Sweden **Switzerland **Ukraine **United Kingdom *Central America *North America **Canada **Mexico **United States *South America (exclusive of Argentina, Brazil and Chile) **Argentina **Brazil **Chile *Oceania This page also provides references and links for all parts of the list. Criteria for inclusion A \\"town tramway service\\" is defined as: *a passenger transport service, *provided to the general public, *operated within or close to towns, cities or villages, *operated with railbound vehicles, *operated on tracks built entirely or largely within public streets and roads. Determining which towns \\"had trams\\" (or \\"streetcars\\") requires subjective judgment to some degree. No \\"universal\\" distinctions can be made between \\"town tramways\\" and other light railways because \\"tramway\\" and \\"railway\\" practices (and laws) varied considerably between countries. For example, the prevailing European standard to distinguish between \\"steam tramways\\" and \\"light railways, worked by steam traction\\" is based on rolling stock type. Lines worked by enclosed \\"tramway type\\" locomotives are classified as \\"steam tramways,\\" and those worked by unenclosed locomotives are classified as \\"light railways.\\" By this standard, virtually all Japanese examples of \\"steam tramways\\" would be classified as \\"light railways,\\" because none (based on the photographic record) used European-type enclosed locomotives. Also in Japan, many of today's suburban electric railways were built under \\"tramway\\" concessions (\\"licenses\\") and were eventually changed to \\"railway\\" concessions. These lines had many \\"tramway\\" characteristics as built but few today. Some town tramway systems had lines or groups of lines that were geographically isolated from the \\"main\\" system. Long-lived examples (i.e. excepting those during formative or closing years) are tabulated if known. Examples include Volgograd, Russia and New York City, US. Opening and closing dates \\"Opening date\\" is that upon which public passenger service was first offered. Test runs and inaugural ceremonies often occurred before this \\"opening date.\\" \\"Closing date\\" is the last \\"full\\" day on which passenger service was offered to the public. Service often extended into the small hours (i.e. past midnight) of the next day. Closure ceremonies and farewell excursions were sometimes held following the end of public service. Some lines were closed following damage suffered as the result of storms, earthquakes or war. In some such cases, closure was not made permanent for some time following the actual last day of public service. Again, the actual \\"last day of operation\\" is tabulated. Operation of some systems was interrupted for prolonged periods (one year or longer) for various reasons, including natural- or man-made catastrophe, financial difficulty or conflict between tramway undertakings and local authorities. These are tabulated if known. Other systems (virtually all of them \\"small\\") operated only on a seasonal basis. Again, these facts are tabulated if known. In some cases, goods (freight) service continued following closure of passenger operation. These have not been tabulated because of incomplete information. Goods service over town tramway systems is a potential category for a separate list. Suburban tramways, rural tramways and interurbans Many town tramway networks extended across municipal boundaries. \\"Suburban\\" municipalities have, in general, not been tabulated separately except in cases of dedicated \\"local\\" or \\"town\\" services. Examples include Footscray, Australia. A general exception to this principle is the UK, where tramways operated as separate municipal undertakings by adjacent towns are tabulated (and grouped by region). Examples include Glasgow and environs. \\"Suburban\\" extensions of town tramway networks are tabulated where known. Lines having a \\"rural\\" or \\"interurban\\" character are generally not tabulated. Many suburban, rural and intercity light railway undertakings operated dedicated \\"local\\" or \\"town\\" service within on-line towns. These are tabulated if known. Many suburban, rural and intercity (interurban) light railway services carried \\"local\\" passengers within various towns. Such towns are not tabulated. The rural tramway networks of Belgium, France and The Netherlands, and US \\"interurban\\" and \\"rural trolley\\" lines (the latter found mostly in New England states) have generally not been tabulated. These categories fully deserve their own lists. \\"Paper tramways\\" and unknown tramways Many towns planned tramways that were not built. So-called \\"paper tramways\\" are beyond the scope of this list. However, in a small number of cases, construction of a town tramway system was started (and, in a very few cases, completed) but the system did not open for public service. These are tabulated if known. Examples include Ajaccio (Corsica), France and Ulricehamn, Sweden. Specific to the US, it is not unknown to find examples of tramways, listed in historic documents among operating systems, that did not in fact exist. It is also not uncommon to find picture postcards, dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, showing tramcars operating in towns where tramways did not exist. (Similar circumstances are likely to exist for other countries.) Certain examples are tabulated, primarily because they appear in well-known historic records and tabulations. It is believed to be very likely that the historic record does not include \\"all\\" public town tramways that ever existed. Town tramways that escaped notice by historians (and regulatory authorities) are thought to have been 1.) located away from Europe, and 2.) worked by some form of traction other than electricity (e.g. horse, steam). Likely countries include Brazil (because of geographic size and incomplete records related to tramways), Mexico (because of its large number of horse- and mule-worked tramways) and the US (because of geographic size and lack of centralized records related to tramways). It is believed to be unlikely, but possible, that the historic record does not include all electric town tramways that ever existed.

John Kruesi (May 15, 1843 – February 22, 1899) was a Swiss-born machinist, and close associate of Thomas Edison. Career John Kruesi had been apprenticed as a locksmithBiography and audio-biography (in German) in Switzerland, and migrated to the United States where he settled in Newark, New Jersey. There, he met Thomas Edison. Edison employed him for his workshop in 1872. Kruesi became Edison's head machinist through his Newark and Menlo Park periods, responsible for translating Edison's numerous rough sketches into working devices. Since constructing and testing models was central to Edison's method of inventing, Kruesi's skill in doing this was critical to Edison's success as an inventor. Historians Robert Friedel and Paul Israel summed up Kruesi's remarkable ability of this: :If the devices that emerged [from Kruesi's workshop] didn't work, it was because they were bad ideas, not because they were badly made. And when the ideas were good, as in the case of the phonograph, the product of Kruesi's shop would prove it. (Friedel and Israel 1987, 35) Kruesi was also involved in many of Edison's key inventions. Including the quadruplex telegraph, the carbon microphone, phonograph, incandescent light bulb and system of electric lighting. With the development of Edison's system of electric lighting, Kruesi moved to more management positions. In 1881, Edison put Kruesi in charge of the Edison Electric Tube Company, making him responsible for the installation of underground power distribution cables from the central generating station. Kruesi was also an inventor, while at the Electric Tube Company, he devised a two wire conduit in which two semicircular conductors were separated by an insulator and covered in insulating material. Kruesi became assistant general manager of the lower Manhattan Edison Machine Works in 1894.John F. Wasik, The Merchant of Power: Sam Insull, Thomas Edison, and the Creation of the Modern Metropolis, Macmillan - 2008, page 28 The Edison Machine Works moved to Schenectady, NY in 1886 and was merged into Edison General Electric in 1889. When that company merged with several others to form General Electric Company in 1892, Kruesi was promoted to General Manager, and then to Chief Mechanical Engineer at the Schenectady site in 1896.

Biography Growing up in Calgary, Alberta, Dean first started playing washtub bass at the age of 12, then a plastic wind-up ukulele which he had received for Christmas at the age of 13. He had received his first guitar 2 months later, an acoustic, which he smashed playing badminton with it when he saved to buy his first electric guitar, later that summer. Dean's early musical influences included Duane Eddy, Luther Perkins, Hank Marvin, The Ventures, The Fireballs, Johnny and the Hurricanes, and later Led Zeppelin, Jeff Beck, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and Boston. Dean's first bands included Cannonball, the Great Canadian River Race, Canada and Scrubbaloe Caine. Scrubbaloe Caine released one album, Round One in 1973 before dissolving by 1975.

Although his origin has not been revealed, Brick is a metahuman with a reddish, stony skin that grants him invulnerability and super-strength. His success as an underworld kingpin is due to his brilliant criminal mind rather than his superhuman powers. Daniel Brickwell appeared as a recurring character on The CW show Arrow, played by Vinnie Jones. Publication history Brick first appeared in Green Arrow vol. 3, #40 and was created by Judd Winick and Phil Hester. Fictional character biography Green Arrow had previously rallied Star City's police and gangsters to confront a demonic power that had cut off the city from the outside world. In the ensuing battle, many lives were lost and a power vacuum was created in Star City's underworld. Into this stepped Daniel \\"Brick\\" Brickwell. Brick was originally a low level henchman/enforcer for various mobsters in Star City and also ran his own street gang. However, he had a brilliant criminal mind and higher aspirations to go with it. In the wake of the demonic attack on Star City, he began to expand his gang's criminal activities, particularly drug sales, into areas left vacant by other criminal organizations. His major success was to unite the various street gangs of Star City under his leadership. These low level criminals were previously denied access to many lucrative areas by more \\"up- market\\" mafioso, but once united under the leadership of Brick they became an overnight crime syndicate with greater manpower and resources than the now greatly weakened traditional organized crime families. As his criminal empire grew, he came to the attention of Star City's police department, Green Arrow, and the council of mafia/gang leaders who represented the various criminal families of Star City. Brick was invited to a meeting of this council and told that his new criminal enterprise would be allowed to continue in Star City, but only if the Mafia were given a cut; his alternative was death. Brick had the house leveled by a missile. His invulnerability left him the sole survivor of the blast and the unopposed ruler of Star City's underworld. Next, he killed the mayor and district attorney of Star City, using a suicide bomber. When he was arrested for the crime, he revealed that he had kidnapped the new mayor's infant daughter (having bribed her security detail) and would kill her if he was not released immediately. Green Arrow was brought in to search for the child, but was unable to find her; Brick's release seemingly proved that he is above the law. Though unable to take Brick into custody, Green Arrow challenged Brick to a duel over who owns Star City. Not being able to best Brick in a test of strength, he shot a glue arrow into Brick's mouth, blocking his throat and suffocating him. Rather than allowing him to die, Green Arrow saved Brick, warning him that should he step too far out of line, next time he will die. Since this incident, his interference with law enforcement and the political figures of Star City has either ceased or vastly subsided. Brick was responsible for hiring Deathstroke to blow up Green Arrow's first house as a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains.Green Arrow vol. 3 #50 (July 2005) In One Year Later, after Doctor Light and Merlyn blew up most of Star City,Green Arrow vol. 3 #60 (May 2006) Brick started fighting the crime that grew in the ruins of the ravaged city and the mutations that appeared in the \\"Glades\\" However, it is later proved he is still the source of illegal activity in the Glades and that he is only fighting the crime that he does not approve of, particularly the drug killing his customers. He has recently teamed up with Red Hood.Green Arrow vol. 3 #69 (February 2007) Brick is later apparently killed by the obsessed Cupid, his dead body left as a \\"gift\\" for her beloved Green Arrow. Apparently surviving this experience, Brick relocates to San Francisco and is seen attempting to kidnap a young girl in order to extort money from her wealthy parents. Upon entering the child's bedroom at night, Brick is ambushed and knocked out by Teen Titan member Miss Martian.Justice League: Cry for Justice #4 (December 2009) In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Brick is reintroduced as one of Richard Dragon's group called the Longbow Hunters, whose aim is to kill Green Arrow because of the $30 million bounty Dragon put out on him.Green Arrow Vol. 5 #31. DC Comics. Brick re-appears in Green Arrow comics following DC Rebirth. He is a mercenary and member of the \\"Ninth Circle\\", an international criminal organization and bank alongside such assassins like Eddie Fyers, Shado and Cheshire.Green Arrow Vol. 6 #10 Powers and abilities Brick's primary power is his invulnerability. He is able to easily withstand a surface-to-air missile strike and numerous attacks from Green Arrow. He also has an unproven level of super-strength: he clearly outmatched Green Arrow, but he did not or could not win with a single hit. Brick is also a highly effective criminal leader. He was able to gain control of Star City's entire underworld, and has great influence over the legal authorities as well. In other media * Brick appears in Young Justice, voiced by Khary Payton. In the beginning of the episode \\"Welcome to Happy Harbor\\", Brick's gun smuggling operation in the docks is thwarted by Speedy. He and his gang attack the hero, but are later defeated by him and the group (Robin, Kid Flash, and Aqualad). In \\"Terrors\\", Brick was seen as an inmate at Belle Reve. He was part of Icicle Sr.'s plan to escape from Belle Reve. The breakout was interrupted by Superboy who defeated him and Blockbuster. In \\"Coldhearted\\", Brick was seen in Belle Reve's cafeteria serving cafeteria food to Count Vertigo while mocking him for his failure. In the Young Justice: Outsiders episode \\"Private Security\\", Brick attempts to steal entire truckloads of virtual reality headsets only to be thwarted by Nightwing, Red Arrow, Arsenal and Guardian. In The Prize, the audio play that is set between seasons 3 and 4, Brick has joined the Suicide Squad. * Brick appears in the \\"Green Arrow\\" segment of DC Nation Shorts, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. * Vinnie Jones portrays Danny \\"Brick\\" Brickwell on The CW series Arrow. His name was previously seen on Oliver's list in the first season. Unlike the comics, he is portrayed as an English Caucasian man and is not a metahuman. He is a vicious gang leader that violates Starling City's government and plots to take over the Glades and is shown to be highly resilient to physical pain. His name, \\"Brick\\", is derived by the number of bullets he's taken and survived. He is also responsible for the death of Malcolm Merlyn's wife, Rebecca, during an initiation of joining a criminal mob, the Orchid Bay Butchers, thus the cause for Malcolm's transformation into a ruthless villain and indirectly setting into motion the events of the series. In the show's third season, a trilogy of episodes where Oliver Queen is absent shows Brick taking control of the Glades, enforcing gang rule, but he was opposed by the Arrow's team, including John Diggle, Felicity Smoak, Roy Harper and the new addition Laurel Lance, as the Black Canary. His gang rule was ended in an uprising led by Arsenal (Roy Harper) and the Black Canary, before Brick himself was ultimately defeated by Merlyn after he came close to killing him in retaliation for his wife's murder. Brick returns in Season 4 episode \\"Monument Point\\", where he joins H.I.V.E. after he escapes from Iron Heights with Damien Darhk and teamed up with Murmur to take down Team Arrow, but was defeated and presumably arrested. In the episode \\"Inmate 4587,\\" Brick is shown as an inmate at Slabside Maximum Security Prison. He and his fellow inmates Bronze Tiger and Derek Sampson take advantage of Oliver's incarceration. In the episode \\"The Longbow Hunters,\\" Oliver cuts a deal with Brick to give him the identity of Ricardo Diaz's ally who put Brick up to attacking him. This deal involved Oliver framing an abusive prison guard for stabbing him. In the episode \\"Crossing Lines,\\" Brick has Oliver Queen fight Derek Sampson in exchange for the person who had Derek and his fellow inmates attack him. After Oliver defeated Sampson and demanded that Brick honors his deal, he gets the answer out of Brick who states that an inmate in Slabside's Level 2 called the \\"Demon\\" is working for Ricardo Diaz and that Brick just carried out the orders. This causes Oliver to do some events that got him transferred to Level 2 so that he can get close to the \\"Demon.\\" He, Derek, and Bronze Tiger later witness Oliver be taken to Level 2. In the episode \\"The Slabside Redemption,\\" Brick works with Ricardo Diaz when he takes over the prison and fights Oliver and Bronze Tiger. When trying to get out through the morgue, he is stabbed and killed by Stanley Dover, whom he previously antagonized for being seemingly timid and weak, only when dying to discover that Dover is actually dangerously sociopathic.

The album was recorded over five days in 2005 in a Norwegian studio during the Notodden Blues Festival. Local musicians were used to back Spencer on all tracks, because he believed that \\"they have retained the 'purity' of the old blues in their playing\\".

Based on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the temple was used as a Hindu, and Zoroastrian place of worship. \\"Ātash\\" (آتش) is the Persian word for fire.ĀTAŠ, M. Boyce, Encyclopædia Iranica The pentagonal complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a tetrapillar-altar in the middle, was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned in the late 19th century, probably due to the dwindling of the Indian population in the area. The natural eternal flame went out in 1969, after nearly a century of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city. The Baku Ateshgah was a pilgrimage and philosophical centre of Zoroastrians from Northwestern Indian subcontinent, who were involved in trade with the Caspian area via the famous \\"Grand Trunk Road\\". The four holy elements of their belief were: ateshi (fire), badi (air), abi (water), and heki (earth). The temple ceased to be a place of worship after 1883 with the installation of petroleum plants (industry) at Surakhany. The complex was turned into a museum in 1975. The annual number of visitors to the museum is 15,000. The Temple of Fire \\"Ateshgah\\" was nominated for List of World Heritage Sites, UNESCO in 1998 by Gulnara Mehmandarova.Surakhany, Atashgyakh (Fire - worshippers, temple - museum at Surakhany) On December 19, 2007, it was declared a state historical- architectural reserve by decree of the President of Azerbaijan. Распоряжение Президента Азербайджанской Республики «Об объявлении территории Храма Атешгях в Сураханском районе города Баку Азербайджанской Республики Государственным историко-архитектурным заповедником „Храм Атешгях“» Etymology The Persian toponym Atashgah (with Russian/Azerbaijani pronunciation: Atashgyakh/Ateshgah) literally means \\"home of fire.\\" The Persian-origin term atesh (آتش) means \\"fire\\", and is a loanword in Azerbaijani; it is etymologically related to the Vedic अथर्वन् atharvan. Gah (گاہ) derives from Middle Persian and means \\"throne\\" or \\"bed\\" and it is identical with Sanskrit gṛha गृह for \\"house\\", which in popular usage becomes gah. The name refers to the fact that the site is situated atop a now-exhausted natural gas field, which once caused natural fires to spontaneously burn there as the gas emerged from seven natural surface vents. Today, the fires in the complex are fed by gas piped in from Baku, and are only turned on for the benefit of visitors. Surakhani, the name of the town where the Ateshgah is located, likely means \\"a region of holes\\" (سراخ/suraakh is Persian for \\"hole\\"), but might perhaps be a reference to the fire glow as well (سرخ/sorkh/surkh is Persian for \\"red\\"). A historic alternative name for Azerbaijan as a whole has been Odlar Yurdu, Azeri for \\"land of fires\\". The etymology in Sanskrit for Surakhani is \\"mine of the gods\\" from sura which stands for the \\"gods\\", who stand in opposition to the asuras, the demons. Surakhany in Tati (the language of Surakhany, close to Persian) means “hole with the fountain”. History Surakhani is located on the Absheron peninsula, which is famous for being a locality where oil oozes naturally from the ground and flames burn perpetually — as at Yanar Dag — fed by natural hydrocarbon vapours issuing from the rock. In the 7th century the Armenian geography Ashkharatsuyts, attributed to Anania Shirakatsi, a location called Yotnporakyan Bagink (“Place with seven worshiped holes”) is mentioned in the Paytakaran province, which is thought to be the Ateshgah.«Армянская География VII века по Р.Х (приписывавшаяся Моисею Хоренскому)» / Перевод и подготовка издания К. П. Патканова. — СПб., 1877 The 8th-century Armenian historian Ghevond, describing a Khazar invasion of Caucasian Albania in 730 AD, mentioned the area \\"Atshi-Baguan”.Histoire des guerres et des conquetes des Arabes en Armenie, par l’eminent Ghevond, vardabet armenien, ecrivain du huitieme siecle Sarah Ashurbeyli notes that the Atsh is distorted Atesh (“fire”) and Atshi-Baguan means “Fires of Baguan”, referring to Baku. The word Baguan comes from the word Baga, which means “God” in Old Persian,С. Ашурбейли. «История города Баку: период средневековья». Изд. Абилов, Зейналов и братья, 2006. and Bhaga, भग, also means \\"God\\" in Sanskrit. \\"Seven holes with eternal fires\\" were mentioned by German traveler Engelbert Kaempfer, who visited Surakhani in 1683.Amoenitatum exoticarum politico-physico-medicarum fasciculi v, quibus continentur variae relationes, observationes & descriptiones rerum Persicarum & ulterioris Asiae, multâ attentione, in peregrinationibus per universum Orientum, collecta, ab auctore Engelberto Kaempfero.

Translated by C. J. F. Dowsett. London, 1961 In the 18th century, Atashgah was visited by Zoroastrians. The Persian handwriting Naskh inscription over the entrance aperture of one of the cells, which speaks about the visit of Zoroastrians from Isfahan: :Persian inscription: :Transliteration of Persian inscription: ::ātaši saf kešide hamčon dak ::jey bovāni reside tā bādak ::sāl-e nav-e nozl mobārak bād goft ::xāne šod ru *sombole sane-ye hazār-o-sad-o-panjāh-o-haštom :Translation:Нейматова М.

The 1158 year corresponds to 1745 AD. Bovan (modern Bovanat) is the village near Esfahan. The word Badak is a diminutive of Bad- Kubeh. (The name of Baku in the sources of the 17th and 18th centuries was Bad-e Kube). At the end of the reference is the constellation of Sombole /Virgo (August–September). In the name of the month the master mistakenly shifted the “l” and “h” at the end of the word. According to Zoroastrian calendar Qadimi New Year in 1745 AD was in August. Interesting information about Zoroastrianism in Baku is given by D. Shapiro in A Karaite from Wolhynia meets a Zoroastrian from Baku.Dan Shapira, “A Karaite from Wolhynia Meets a Zoroastrian from Baku,” in Iran and the Caucasus, Vol. 5, No. 1, 2001, pp. 105-106 Avraham Firkowicz, a Karaite collector of ancient manuscripts, wrote about his meeting in Darband in 1840 with a fire-worshipper from Baku. Firkowicz asked him “Why do you worship fire?” The fire-worshipper replied that he worshipped not fire, but the Creator symbolised by fire - a “matter” or abstraction (and hence not a person) called Q’rţ’ . Pahlavi Q’rţ’ (from Avestan kirdar or Sanskrit kṛt and कर्ता) signifies “one who does” or “creator”. According to the famed Parsi Dastur J.J.Modi, who investigated the shrine: \\"\\"I became convinced that this place has nothing to do with Parsees. It is not a Parsee Atash Kadeh but a Hindu Temple.\\"J.J. Modi, My Travels Outside Bombay. Structure Guebre ceremony in Ateshgah temple Some scholars have speculated that the Ateshgah may have been an ancient Zoroastrian shrine that was decimated by invading Islamic armies during the Muslim conquest of Persia and its neighboring regions. It has also been asserted that, \\"according to historical sources, before the construction of the Indian Temple of Fire (Atashgah) in Surakhani at the end of the 17th century, the local people also worshipped at this site because of the 'seven holes with burning flame'.\\". Fire is considered sacred in Hinduism and Zoroastrianism (as Agni and Atar respectively), and there has been debate on whether the Atashgah was originally a Hindu structure, or a Zoroastrian one. The trident mounted atop the structure is usually a distinctly Hindu sacred symbol (as the Trishula, which is commonly mounted on temples) and has been cited by Zoroastrian scholars as a specific reason for considering the Atashgah as a Hindu site. However, an Azeri presentation on the history of Baku, which calls the shrine a \\"Hindu temple\\", identifies the trident as a Zoroastrian symbol of \\"good thoughts, good words and good deeds\\"., even though the trident symbol is not associated with Zoroastrianism One early European commentator, Jonas Hanway, bucketed Zoroastrians, Sikhs, and Hindus together with respect to their religious beliefs: \\"These opinions, with a few alterations, are still maintained by some of the posterity of the ancient Indians and Persians, who are called Gebers or Gaurs, and are very zealous in preserving the religion of their ancestors; particularly in regard to their veneration for the element of fire.\\" Geber is a Persian term for Zoroastrians, while Gaurs are a priestly Hindu caste. A later scholar, A. V. Williams Jackson, drew a distinction between the two groups. While stating that \\"the typical features which Hanway mentions are distinctly Indian, not Zoroastrian\\" based on the worshipers' attires and tilakas, their strictly vegetarian diets and open veneration for cows, he left open the possibility that a few \\"actual Gabrs (i.e. Zoroastrians, or Parsis)\\" may also have been present at the shrine alongside larger Hindu and Sikh groups. Indian local residents and pilgrims Engraving of the temple In the late Middle Ages, there were significant Indian communities throughout Central Asia. In Baku, Indian merchants from the Multan region of Punjab controlled much of the commercial economy, along with the Armenians. Much of the woodwork for ships on the Caspian was also done by Indian craftsmen. Some commentators have theorized that Baku's Indian community may have been responsible for the construction or renovation of the Ateshgah. As European academics and explorers began arriving in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, they documented encounters with dozens of Hindus at the shrine as well as Sikh pilgrims en route in the regions between North India and Baku. Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin's Reise durch Russland (1771) is cited in Karl Eduard von Eichwald's Reise in den Caucasus (Stuttgart, 1834) where the naturalist Gmelin is said to have observed Yogi austerities being performed by devotees. Geologist Eichwald restricts himself to a mention of the worship of Rama, Krishna, Hanuman and Agni.. In the 1784 account of George Forster of the Bengal Civil Service, the square structure was about 30 yards across, surrounded by a low wall and containing many apartments. Each of these had a small jet of sulphurous fire issuing from a funnel \\"constructed in the shape of a Hindu altar.\\" The fire was used for worship, cooking and warmth, and would be regularly extinguished. \\"The Ateshgyakh Temple looks not unlike a regular town caravansary - a kind of inn with a large central court, where caravans stopped for the night. As distinct from caravansaries, however, the temple has the altar in its center with tiny cells for the temple's attendants - Indian ascetics who devoted themselves to the cult of fire - and for pilgrims lining the walls.\\". Zoroastrian local residents and pilgrims Drawing of the temple from the book \\"Journey in Dagestan and the Caucasus\\" There are some data that in addition to the Hindus in the temple were present Zoroastrians (Parsis and Guebres) and Sikhs. Chardin in the 17th century reported about Persian Guebres, which worshiped forever burning fire that was in two days' journey from Shemakha (on the Apsheron).Chardin J.

German Baron Max Thielmann visited the temple in October 1872 and in his memoirs he wrote that Parsi community of Bombay sent here a priest who after a few years will be replaced. His presence is necessary, because here come the pilgrims from the outskirts of Persia (Yazd, Kerman) and from India and remain in this sacred place for several months or years.Thielmann, Journey in the Caucasus, Persia, and Turkey in Asia, Eng. tr. by Heneage, 2. 9-12, London, 1876 In 1876 English traveler James Bruce visited Ateshgah. He noted that the Bombay Parsi Punchayat provides a permanent presence in the temple of their priest.James Bryce. Transcaucasia and Ararat: Being Notes of a Vacation Tour in the Autumn Of 1876. Pierre Ponafidine visited the temple at the same time and mentioned about two priests from Bombay.Life in the Moslem East By Pierre Ponafidine, Emma Cochran Ponafidine, 1911. E. Orsolle, who visited the temple after Bruce, said that after Parsi priest died in 1864, the Parsi Punchayat of Bombay a few years later sent another priest here, but the pilgrims who came here from India and Iran have already forgotten the sanctuary, and in 1880 there was nobody.E. Orsolle. Le Caucase et la Perse. Ouvrage accompagné d’une carte et d’un plan. Paris, E.

Merv Oasis: Travels and Adventures East of the Caspian during the years 1879-80-81. 2 vols. New York, 1883 In 1898 in the «Men and Women of India» magazine was published an article entitled \\"The ancient Zoroastrian temple in Baku. Author calls Ateshgah as \\"Parsi temple,\\" and notes that the last Zoroastrian priest was sent there for about 30 years ago (that is, in the 1860s.).Men and Women of India. Vol. 1, no. 12, p. 696, Bombay, Dec. 1898 J. Henry in 1905, in his book also noted that 25 years ago (i.e. about in 1880) in Surakhani died last Parsi priest.J. D. Henry, Baku, an Eventful History, 1906 The Parsi Dastur J.J. Modi who visited the site in 1925 was emphatic that it was not a Zoroastrian temple because of its design and other considerations. He believed it was a Hindu temple.J.J. Modi, My Travels Outside Bombay. Inscriptions and likely period of construction Ateshgah, beginning of 20th century There are several inscriptions on the Ateshgah. They are all in either Sanskrit or Punjabi, with the exception of one Persian inscription that occurs below an accompanying Sanskrit invocation to Lord Ganesha and Jwala Ji. Although the Persian inscription contains grammatical errors, both the inscriptions contain the same year date of 1745 Common Era (Samvat/संवत 1802/१८०२ and Hijri 1158/١١٥٨). Taken as a set, the dates on the inscriptions range from Samvat 1725 to Samvat 1873, which corresponds to the period from 1668 CE to 1816 CE. This, coupled with the assessment that the structure looks relatively new, has led some scholars to postulate the 17th century as its likely period of construction. One press report asserts that local records exist that state that the structure was built by the Baku Hindu traders community around the time of the fall of the Shirvanshah dynasty and annexation by the Russian Empire following the Russo- Persian War (1722–1723). The inscriptions in the temple in Sanskrit (in Nagari Devanagari script) and Punjabi (in Gurmukhi script) identify the site as a place of Hindu and Sikh worship, and state it was built and consecrated for Jwala Ji, the modern Hindu fire deity. Jwala (जवाला/ज्वाला) means flame in Sanskrit (c.f. Indo-European cognates: proto-Indo-European guelh, English: glow, Lithuanian: zvilti) and Ji is an honorific used in the Indian subcontinent. There is a famed shrine to Jwala Ji in the Himalayas, in the settlement of Jawalamukhi, in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India to which the Atashgah bears strong resemblance and on which some scholars (such as A. V. Williams Jackson) suggested the current structure may have been modeled. However, other scholars have stated that some Jwala Ji devotees used to refer to the Kangra shrine as the 'smaller Jwala Ji' and the Baku shrine as the 'greater Jwala Ji'. Other deities mentioned in the inscriptions include Ganesha and Shiva. The Punjabi language inscriptions are quotations from the Adi Granth, while some of the Sanskrit ones are drawn from the Sat Sri Ganesaya namah text. Examination by Zoroastrian priests Illustration from Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary (1890—1907) In 1876, James Bryce visited the region and found that \\"the most remarkable mineral product is naphtha, which bursts forth in many places, but most profusely near Baku, on the coast of the Caspian, in strong springs, some of which are said to always be burning.\\" Without referencing the Atashgah by name, he mentioned of the Zoroastrians that \\"after they were extirpated from Persia by the Mohammedans, who hate them bitterly, some few occasionally slunk here on pilgrimage\\" and that \\"under the more tolerant sway of the Czar, a solitary priest of fire is maintained by the Parsee community of Bombay, who inhabits a small temple built over one of the springs\\".. The temple was examined in the late 19th and early 20th century by Parsi dasturs, some of whom had also visited the Jwala Ji at Kangra in the Himalayas. Based on the inscriptions and the structure, their assessment was that the temple was a Hindu and Sikh shrine. In 1925, a Zoroastrian priest and academic Jivanji Jamshedji Modi traveled to Baku to determine if the temple had indeed been once a Zoroastrian place of worship. Until then (and again today), the site was visited by Zoroastrian pilgrims from India. In his Travels Outside Bombay, Modi observed that \\"not just me but any Parsee who is a little familiar with our Hindu or Sikh brethren's religion, their temples and their customs, after examining this building with its inscriptions, architecture, etc., would conclude that this is not a [Zoroastrian] Atash Kadeh but is a Hindu Temple whose Brahmins (priests) used to worship fire (Sanskrit: Agni).\\" Besides the physical evidence indicating that the complex was a Hindu place of worship, the existing structural features are not consistent with those for any other Zoroastrian or Sikh places of worship (for instance, cells for ascetics, fireplace open to all sides, ossuary pit and no water source. It cannot be ruled out that the site may once have been a Zoroastrian place of worship. As a Hindu temple it is taken to belong to one of four major fire Jwala Ji temples. J. Unvala visited temple in 1935 and noted that its structure is pure Sasanian style.J. M. Unvala. Inscriptions from Surihani near Baku Exhaustion of the natural gas The fire temple of Baku, c. 1860 The fire was once fed by a vent from a subterranean natural gas field located directly beneath the complex, but heavy exploitation of the natural gas reserves in the area during Soviet rule resulted in the flame going out in 1969. Today, the museum's fire is fed by mains gas piped in from Baku city... Claimed visit by Czar Alexander III Seven holy fires and revered temple enclosure in Surakhany There were local claims made to a visiting Zoroastrian dastur in 1925 that the Russian czar Alexander III who was in Baku in 1888https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:In_1888,_Tsar_Alexander_III_visited_Baku.jpgwitnessed Hindu fire prayer rituals at this location. However, the latter claim had not been verified. Public recognition The Fire Temple of Baku on an Azerbaijan postage stamp issued in 1919 An illustration of the Baku Fire Temple was included on two denominations of Azerbaijan's first issue of postage stamps, released in 1919. Five oil derricks appear in the background.Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue (2007), \\"Azerbaijan\\", cat. nos. 9 & 10\\\\. Vargas and Bazleh, Azerbaijan International 3.2 (Summer 1995). By a presidential order issued in December 2007, the shrine complex, which had hitherto been officially associated with the \\"Shirvanshah Palace Complex State Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve\\" (Государственного историко-архитектурного музея-заповедника «Комплекс Дворца Ширваншахов») was declared as a distinct reserve by the Azeri government (the \\"Ateshgah Temple State Historical Architectural Reserve, Государственным историко-архитектурным заповедником «Храм Атешгях»). In July 2009, the Azeri President, Ilham Aliyev, announced a grant of AZN 1 million for the upkeep of the shrine. In April 2018, the former External Affairs Minister of India, Sushma Swaraj, visited and paid her respects to the shrine.

It is part of the southern tip of the Appalachian mountain chain and it is the largest plateau in the chain. Geologically a continuation of Walden Ridge, Sand Mountain is part of the Cumberland Plateau, separated from the main portion of the plateau by the Tennessee River and Sequatchie Valley. The average elevation on Sand Mountain is around above sea level, compared to about in the surrounding area.Google Earth This elevation leads to its having the coolest climate in the state of Alabama. The largest city on Sand Mountain is Albertville, in Marshall County. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 21,160. History Prehistory through the Colonial Period The Sand Mountain area has been inhabited for at least 9,000 years, as evidenced by archaeological finds at nearby Russell Cave National Monument, near Bridgeport, Alabama.David Hurst Thomas, Exploring Ancient Native America, Routledge, 1999, pg 77. In historical times, Cherokee and Creek villages were located in the Tennessee Valley to the west of Sand Mountain, and in Wills Valley to the east. Sequoyah, creator of the Cherokee syllabary, lived in the Cherokee village of Wills Town, near present-day Fort Payne in Wills Valley.Thomas E. Mails, The Cherokee People, Council Oak Books, 1992, pg 343. The first Europeans to see it were probably Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto and his men, who are believed to have crossed Sand Mountain during their journey through southeastern North America between 1539 and 1543. One of the likely routes for the expedition traces their path across Sand Mountain on the way south from the Tennessee Valley to the Coosa Valley.Charles Hudson, Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun: Hernando de Soto and the South's Ancient Chiefdoms, University of Georgia Press, 1998, pg 460. Civil War Union troops under Major General George H. Thomas crossed Sand Mountain in September 1863 in an attempt to cut off the Confederate troops in Chattanooga. They were unsuccessful, and the opposing armies met at the Battle of Chickamauga on September 19–20, 1863, resulting in a major Confederate victory.Victor Hicken, Illinois in the Civil War, University of Illinois Press; 1991, p. 194 Jackson and DeKalb counties, along with the other counties of north Alabama, had voted against immediate secession in December 1860, and pro-Union sentiment remained strong on Sand Mountain. In early 1861, citizens in several northeastern counties proposed breaking away from Alabama and joining with neighboring counties of East Tennessee to create a new Union state of Nickajack.Fleming, Walter L., Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama. New York: Columbia University Press, 1905, pp 109-111. Industries such as mining, milling, and working for the railroad were acceptable as exemptions to military service for Southern unionists, and some on Sand Mountain who did not wish to serve in the army worked at Sauta Cave in the Tennessee Valley, mining potassium nitrate to make gunpowder at Selma.Storey, Margaret M., Loyalty and Loss, Alabama's Unionists in the Civil War and Reconstruction, Louisiana State University Press, 2004. In September 1861, the \\"Paint Rock Rifles\\" were raised on Sand Mountain by Confederate Colonel Lemuel Green Mead of Jackson County. They became Company C of the 26th Alabama Infantry Regiment, and served with distinction at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. Mead resigned his infantry commission in July 1862, after Union troops had invaded north Alabama, and organized an independent company of partisan rangers who carried out guerrilla raids against occupying Union forces. The company was the core of what eventually became Mead's Alabama and Tennessee Cavalry Battalion. In the summer of 1862, \\"Gunter's 1st Partisan Ranger Battalion\\" was formed on Sand Mountain in Jackson County by Major William T. Gunter. The battalion consisted of five mounted companies and served under Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest in skirmishes along the Tennessee River. In November 1862, the battalion was merged with the 33rd Alabama Infantry Regiment. A Union regiment, the 1st Tennessee and Alabama Vidette Cavalry, was formed at Union-occupied Stevenson, Alabama, in 1863, drawing men primarily from Sand Mountain, many of them Confederate deserters. However, the regiment was never all together and the companies were scattered around the area on guard duty. It was eventually disbanded before the end of the war.Potter, Johnny, First Tennessee & Alabama Independent Vidette Cavalry Roster, 1863-1864, Mountain Press, 1995. 20th century Sand Mountain was home, from 1903 to 1905, to a short-lived commune of forty Russian Jewish families attempting to form a collective farm and manufacturing concern. Due to the isolation of the area from other Jewish communities, the limestone soil of the area, and disharmony within the group, the project was abandoned and the inhabitants relocated after two years. Geography Sand Mountain viewed from Trenton, Georgia Sand Mountain runs in a diagonal northeast-southwest direction from the northeastern corner of Alabama, and includes parts of Jackson, DeKalb, Marshall, Etowah and Blount counties in Alabama, as well as part of Dade County, Georgia. Sand Mountain, especially the northern end, i.e. eastern Jackson County and northern DeKalb County, is mostly a rural, agricultural area, with a mix of chicken, cow, and potato farms, as well as other assorted farms, and large expanses of both rolling pastures and forests. It contains many small towns (less than 1,000 people) and unincorporated communities. Current issues and social characteristics Politically and religiously, Sand Mountain is a fairly conservative place, consistently voting for conservative candidates in elections, and with Baptists claiming the largest number of congregants of any church denomination. Much of Sand Mountain is dry, with the sale of alcoholic beverages being forbidden. There is very little racial diversity on Sand Mountain, particularly the northern half, which is nearly all white. Sand Mountain is one of the last places in the country with churches which still use Sacred Harp singing in their Sunday morning church services, and is home to many of the largest and oldest continuous Sacred Harp singings in the country, as well as many important singers (i.e. editors of the Sacred Harp tunebook).The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition. Snake handling by some churches on Sand Mountain was the subject of Salvation on Sand Mountain, a 1996 book by Dennis Covington.Dennis Covington, Salvation on Sand Mountain: Snake-Handling and Redemption in Southern Appalachia, Penguin (Non-Classics):March 1, 1996 Those who live on Sand Mountain state that the book mostly took place in Scottsboro, in the Tennessee River valley to the west of Sand Mountain. Climate Sand Mountain, being located in the mid-South, has long hot humid summers, and winters which are short and mild by comparison to much of the rest of the country, with snow being a real rarity. Its elevation, however, leads to it being cooler than the rest of the state of Alabama. On Sand Mountain, between 60 and 90 days per year are over , according to the Heat Zone Map published by the American Horticultural Society. By comparison, the great majority of the upper Midwest and Northeast has less than 30 such days per year. These hot days, combined with the South's high humidity, make it sweltering in the summer. The average daytime temperature is in the high 70s or above for at least five months out of the year (May through September). Sand Mountain has higher rainfall than almost anywhere else in the South, including anywhere else in Alabama, with the exception of the Gulf Coast area. Some areas of Sand Mountain get more than of rainfall per year (though others get as little as ). The following is a general idea of Sand Mountain's climate, taken from Ider, Alabama: Soil Sand Mountain has, on average, a depth of soil - after which is solid sandstone bedrock. The soil is generally loam-based, and is a mixture of sandy loam and silty loam, drawing from such series as Apison, Atkins, Cotaco- Barbourville, Crossville, Hartsells, Lickdale, and Muskingum. It is extremely acidic, growing more so the deeper you go from the top. It is classified as \\"well-drained\\".

Location and description The mountains are related to the East African Rift, and are in two chains, the Western Rift includes the Virunga Mountains, Mitumba Mountains, and the Rwenzori Range, while the mountains to the east include the largest peaks in Africa: the snow-covered Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m, 19,340 ft), and Mount Kenya (5,199m, 17,058 ft). Other mountains in the Eastern Rift area include Mount Elgon in Kenya and Uganda. All but the Ruwenzori are of volcanic origin. The weather at the highest elevations is often cold and wet. Fauna The mountains are rich in wildlife, including animals who migrate to higher altitudes during the hot season in the surrounding savanna. The mountains are home to a number of endemic bird species such as Hinde's babbler which lives only on Mount Kenya. Threats and preservation The lower elevations of the mountains have been extensively used for forestry and for growing tea and coffee and much of the original forest has been lost, including the cloud forest that once covered much of Kilimanjaro. Climbing these mountains is a major attraction and Kilimanjaro National Park attracts hundreds of visitors each year, many of whom access the mountain from the coffee-growing town of Moshi.

Located in Fantasyland, it is one of the few remaining attractions that was operational on Disneyland's opening day in 1955. The ride's story is based on Disney's 1937 film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, their first animated feature film. The now-closed ride at the Magic Kingdom and the version at Tokyo Disneyland are named Snow White's Adventures, and the Disneyland Park (Paris) version is called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Disneyland version was originally known as Snow White and her Adventures before its redesign in 1983. History Snow White's Scary Adventures opened on Disneyland's opening day as Snow White and her Adventures. Imagineers had designed the ride so that guests felt like they were the main character of the story; in this case, guests were Snow White. Few people understood this concept, and some wondered why Snow White was not featured in the ride. During 1983, all of the Fantasyland dark rides were completely redesigned as part of a large overhaul of Fantasyland. This attraction and the other dark rides were modified to include the main characters of the films they represented. Today, Snow White appears once in the attraction. The present outdoor facade was made to resemble the Evil Queen's castle from the movie. When the Witch offered guests the poisoned apple in one scene, guests frequently tried (and sometimes managed) to steal the apple and bring it home as a souvenir. When Fantasyland was reopened in 1983, they solved the problem of the ever-missing poisoned apple by replacing it with an image of an apple projected by means of a parabolic mirror. Guests who reach out to steal the apple now find their hands passing through it. Magic Kingdom's original version of this ride, like their early version of Peter Pan's Flight, also put the guests in the role of the story's main character (Snow White). Around Christmas of 1994, a less frightening version of the ride took its place; an appearance by Snow White was also added. The redesigned ride took some cues from the version at Disneyland Paris, including increasing the ride capacity of each ride vehicle from four to six passengers. On January 7, 2020, the attraction at Disneyland closed for an extended refurbishment. Walt Disney Imagineering will install new scenes as well as update the attraction's audio and visual technology. The attraction's exterior will also be refreshed to complement the nearby Sleeping Beauty Castle.  Attraction summary  Disneyland 1955-1981 version For the original 1955 version of the attraction, titled Snow White and Her Adventures, it was intended for park guests to experience Snow White's story through her point of view, which is why she herself wasn't in her own attraction (although a figure of her was added to the ride for a brief period in the 1970s). After guests boarded their ride vehicles, they would begin their adventure by venturing the mine where the dwarfs dig for diamonds. At the mine's exit, Dopey could be seen pointing to a sign reading \\"BEWARE OF THE WITCH\\". After passing by a forest full of Snow White's animal friends, the guests would approach a fork in the road, with arrows pointing to the dwarfs' cottage or the Wicked Witch's Castle, the vehicles would turn in the direction of the castle, with two vultures ominously perched on a tree near it. At the castle entrance, the vehicles would begin to escape toward the direction of the cottage, only for a gate to fall down and trap the guests inside. As the guests went through the castle halls, passing by skeletons moaning \\"Go baaack!\\", guests would see the Witch at her cauldron, preparing her poisoned apple. Then, after escaping the castle, the vehicles wind through a dark forest filled with living trees, before finally reaching the dwarfs' cottage, with the Witch standing in the doorway to offer the guests her apple. Finally, the vehicles would travel toward the entrance of a cave, with the Witch standing above it trying to move a boulder to crush the guests with. Upon entering the dark cave, the guests would hear the Witch meeting her demise before returning to the boarding area and exiting the attraction. The attraction closed for refurbishment in December 1981 Disneyland 1983-2020 The Evil Queen's book of spells in the dungeon Guests enter the ride building through the Evil Queen's castle. Overlooking the entrance is a high window whose curtains are parted every few minutes by the Evil Queen. A metal, gold-colored apple is within reach of guests standing in the queue. Touching the apple causes the disembodied voice of the Queen to cackle menacingly. Guests wind their way through a dungeon inside the castle, passing by a book of poisons. The book reads, \\"One taste of the poisoned apple and the victim's eyes will close forever in the Sleeping Death.\\" Like most of the dark rides, the boarding area is dominated by a large mural depicting characters from the movie. The ride vehicles resemble the beds of the Seven Dwarfs and feature the names of each dwarf, much like their beds in the film. When guests board the ride vehicles, they enter the Dwarfs' cottage first. Here, the music and yodeling from \\"The Silly Song\\" can be heard, while birds, chipmunks, and other forest creatures perform housekeeping tasks such as hanging a clothesline and washing the dishes. Guests pass Snow White followed by some of her animal friends climbing the stairs to the second floor of the cottage. The guests then move past the Dwarfs, who are performing \\"The Silly Song\\". When guests leave the cottage, they pass by the Queen who says \\"Soon I'll be fairest in the land.\\" They then enter the Dwarfs' diamond mine, which is full of jewels of many colors. Guests pass under a branch with two vultures perched on it and enter the Queen's castle. There, they see the Queen as she stands before her Magic Mirror with her back to the guests and beautiful reflection saying, \\"Magic Mirror on the wall...\\" She then turns and faces the guests. They see that she has become an ugly, green-eyed, toothless witch with a wart on her nose. \\"With this disguise, I'll fool them all!\\" she adds. This effect is achieved by two models—one queen and one witch—rotating on different sides of the 'mirror', which is actually a sheet of transparent glass. Projections and LED lights create the effect of cobwebs and electricity running through the walls. Guests continue to pass through the castle laden with skeletons. Nearby, the Witch is accompanied by a raven in a dungeon where she is creating a poisoned apple for Snow White. She heads for the Dwarfs' cottage in a small boat. Guests wind their way through a menacing forest. Here, trees have ugly faces and branches like talons or grasping hands. Bats fly everywhere and logs resemble snapping crocodiles. The guests then turn toward the Seven Dwarfs' cottage. The door opens to reveal the Witch, who offers the guests the apple. Guests turn towards a mountainside where the Dwarfs pursue the Witch. Nearby, the Witch tries to roll a boulder down the mountain to crush the Dwarfs below. However, a strike of lightning causes her to tumble to her death; her scream is heard as guests exit the area. Returning to the boarding and debarkation area, guests pass a giant book featuring a silhouette of Snow White and her Prince with his horse as they wander away towards a castle. The words at the bottom of this picture read, \\"And they lived happily ever after.\\" The guests then disembark from the ride vehicles and return to Fantasyland. The attraction closed for refurbishment on January 7, 2020 The installation at Disneyland was manufactured by Arrow Development. Magic Kingdom The original version of the ride at Magic Kingdom in Florida which ran from 1971 to 1994 was very different, and arguably more frightening. Snow White was not seen at all, and the Dwarfs showed up only briefly in one scene. There were also seven witch figures in this version, whereas there were only six in the 1994 version. The queue was similar to Tokyo Disneyland's current queue. It featured the Dwarfs' mine, with their cottage visible in the distance. Guests began by entering the castle in a scene very much like the 1994 ride; however, there was no part where Snow White was seen cleaning. Instead, riders saw a side of the Dwarfs' cottage as \\"I'm Wishing\\" played in the background. Upon entering, with the queen watching in a nearby window, the guests saw a mirror, but not the magic one. The Queen still transformed into the Witch by saying, \\"Mirror Mirror on the wall, I am the fairest one of all!\\" and was still seen at the cauldron preparing the poisoned apple. The riders then \\"crashed\\" through the dungeon walls and escaped through the forest with the tree monsters and the crocodile logs (still bumping into the Witch, who was on a boat). Soon, guests arrived in the Dwarfs' cottage to see the animals peering in at them. They then passed the Dwarfs (in their only appearance) walking up the stairs to their room to investigate a frightening shadow. The Witch was waiting in the doorway with the apple. Riders would then exit the cottage, back into the woods, and pass by two ominous vultures. The final scene was the diamond mine, where the Witch appeared several more times. Her final appearance was on top of a doorway, pushing an enormous jewel onto the riders. Riders would then enter a room full of flashing cartoon-like strobe lights (similar to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disneyland in California) with the Witch's cackling echoing in their ears. Guests then disembarked. Ginny Tyler did the voice of the Witch in this version, while Mel Blanc, Paul Frees, Hal Smith, Hans Conried and Dallas McKennon did the voices of the Dwarfs. On October 14, 1994, the Magic Kingdom attraction was closed in order to undergo a redesign in order to be similar to the Disneyland version, but in a different order with a few new scenes. The attraction re-opened on December 16, 1994 with a much lighter tone. Guests boarded the ride by a mural depicting the characters of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and began their ride in the Queen's courtyard where Snow White was seen working outside. The Queen watched her (and the guests) from her window. Inside the castle, the scene was similar to the Disneyland version (with the Queen turning into the Witch and working at the cauldron), although the Magic Mirror (voiced by Tony Jay) was added who said, \\"Alas! Snow White is the fairest one of all,\\" to which the Queen (voiced by Louise Chamis) replied, \\"Never!\\" The ride continued into the forest where the Huntsman (a newly added character in this version, and voiced by Peter Renaday) tells Snow White to run away and strobe lighting effects that resembled lightning lit up Snow White running through the tree monsters, and then into the Dwarfs' cottage where the \\"Dwarfs' Yodel Song\\" played. In a new scene, the riders then passed the Witch giving Snow White the apple, then emerged from the cottage as she gloated that she was the fairest one of all. From there, guests rode through the mine where the two of the Dwarfs (Sleepy and Sneezy) called to them to stop the Witch. After the scene where the Witch tried to drop a rock on the dwarfs, there was a new ending with the Prince waking Snow White and then leading her away on his horse as two of the Dwarfs waved goodbye. Dopey was seen above the bridge, waving to all the passengers. Guests then traveled through the open doors under the bridge and disembarked. Disneyland Paris Disneyland Paris' ride is basically the same as the current Disneyland version. The only real difference is that one of the mine carts use a sound effect from the pre 1994 Disney World version and a happy ending similar to Disney World's. However, in this variation, instead of passing the Prince waking up Snow White and then Dopey on an arch, all the Dwarfs, the Prince and Snow White are on an arch, with Snow White sitting on the Prince's horse and waving the guests goodbye. On the left side of the guests, the Prince's castle is seen above the clouds. The ride is also called Blanche Neige et les Sept Nains, which is French for \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\". Tokyo Disneyland Tokyo Disneyland represents a mix of the American versions at the time of the park's opening, although it is largely based on the pre-1994 Walt Disney World version. It begins in the castle where the Queen transforms into the Witch, moving on to the dungeon and passing her on boat. After going through the forest, guests enter the cottage and instead of seeing the dwarfs passing up the stairs seeing the shadow, the Seven Dwarfs are seen Doing The Dwarfs' Yodel song, with Snow White watching from the stairs (similar to the beginning in Disneyland and in Disneyland Paris). Exiting the cottage, guests find the Witch outside waiting for them, then enter the mines (mix in the Disneylands in California and Paris and Similar to the Pre-1994 version). They approach the cottage again and encounter the Witch with the apple. The ride ends like Disneyland's version, with the Dwarfs and Witch on the cliff, although without the \\"happy ending.\\" Gallery File:Disneyland Snow White's Scary Adventures poster.jpg|Anaheim's attraction poster File:Snow White's Adventures at TDL.jpg|Tokyo Disneyland version See also *List of Disneyland attractions *List of Magic Kingdom attractions *List of Tokyo Disneyland attractions *List of Disneyland Park (Paris) attractions References External links *Disneyland website *Tokyo Disneyland website *Disneyland Park (Paris) website Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1955 Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1971 Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1983 Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1992 Category:Amusement rides manufactured by Arrow Dynamics Category:Disneyland Category:Magic Kingdom Category:Tokyo Disneyland Category:Disneyland Park (Paris) Category:Dark rides Category:Audio- Animatronic attractions Category:Snow White (franchise) in amusement parks Category:Fantasyland Category:Amusement rides that closed in 2012 Category:1955 establishments in California Category:1971 establishments in Florida Category:2012 disestablishments in Florida Category:1983 establishments in Japan Category:1992 establishments in France ","title":"Snow White's Scary Adventures"},{"id":"4505464","text":"A woman wearing denim pedal pushers on Broadway in SoHo, New York City (Summer 2011) Pedal pushers are calf-length trousers that were popular during the 1950s and the early 1960s.

The island is uninhabited apart from a holiday home: it is an Area of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation.  Wallabies  Red necked wallaby (picture taken in North Florida) Wallabies, of the species Macropus rufogriseus (Red-necked Wallaby), were introduced by Lady Colquhoun in the 1940s, and still roam wild. It is one of the very few places outside Australia which has a viable population of wallabies. More recently, there has been great controversy over them, and it has been suggested that they should be culled, or eradicated, as they supposedly threaten the capercaillie population.Scottish Daily Record, 06/06/2009 Colony of Wallabies set for cull The cull has proven controversial, as some tourists visit the area specifically to see them, and because some animal rights activists consider it cruel. Iain Sheves, factor for Luss Estates, has said, :\\"If it comes down a decision between rare native species, which are perhaps better served by being on an island because of predation issues, and a non indigenous population of creatures which shouldn’t really be there then we’ve got to go with the native species every time. :\\"I would hope that people come to Scotland to see native wildlife and habitats rather than a quirk of history. :\\"Ultimately, we all have a responsibility to try and promote and protect our native wildlife. To disregard that in order to maintain a tourist oddity is not the right thing to do.\\"Wallabies face being wiped out Jun 5 2009 by Marc McLean, Lennox Herald Over the years, there have been several unauthorized cullings, which have shocked Scottish locals and tourists visiting the island, who stumble upon, the often mutilated, bodies of the island's wallabies. No perpetrators have been found, and the motive is unknown. Sale On 9 July 2020, Inchconnachan Island is put up for sale by the Colquhoun family with a price tag of offers over £500,000. The sale includes a derelict colonial-style timber bungalow dating from the 1920s, built for the tea merchant Admiral Sullivan, which was later the holiday home of the family of Lady Arran Colquhoun. Planning consent and detailed architectural drawings are in place to replace the bungalow with a new four- bedroom lodge and one-bedroom warden's house, along with a boat house and pier.

Listed at 5' 10\\", 200 lb., Traxler batted and threw left- handed. Biography Traxler was born in Waukegan, Illinois, and he was an all-state outfielder for Waukegan East High School. He played college baseball at the University of New Orleans. Traxler was selected by the Dodgers in the 16th round of the 1988 MLB draft and made his MLB debut on April 24, 1990. Additionally, he played in 1994 for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks of Nippon Professional Baseball. Later on, he returned to the Dodgers organization in 1995, and then played one season in Taiwan for the Ho-Hsin Whales.Chinese Taiwan language data Traxler starred for the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks for 1½ years, including their inaugural 1996 season. That year, Traxler was one of the top hitters in the Northern League batting .335 with 16 doubles, two triples and 16 home runs, while driving in 75 runs and scoring 73 times in 83 games. In 1997, he followed with a .298 average, 12 doubles, three homers, 37 RBI and 29 runs scored in 42 games. He also spent six seasons with the Albuquerque Dukes Triple-A club. He is remembered as a favorite all-time player of many Dukes fans. In between, Traxler played winter ball from 1991 through 1994 in the Dominican Republic (Tigres del Licey), Venezuela (Leones del Caracas) and Puerto Rico (Indios de Mayagüez), where he became a cult figure among fans of these countries. Traxler played in the independent Atlantic League for the Somerset Patriots in 1999 and hit 12 home runs. Though the scorecard still described him as 5'10\\" and 200 lbs, an author described Traxler as weighing more than 250 lbs. Following his playing days, he became a hitting instructor in the Dodgers minor league system. After the 2004 season, the Dodgers did not renew Traxler's contract, and he was planning to look for another position at the upcoming Winter Meetings.

Its name comes from the Kichwa indigenous language and means \\"Lago del Cuy\\" or Guinea Pig Laguna in English. It was given this name due to the guinea pig shape of the largest Island in the middle of the laguna. These animals play a significant part in the everyday life of Ecuadorians, as they reproduce rapidly and need a minimum of food and care to survive. They make for a high protein meal especially for populations living in high altitude. The caldera was created by a massive eruption about 3100 years ago that generated about 5 cubic kilometres (6.54 billion cubic yards) of pyroclastic flow and covered the surrounding area in volcanic ash up to 20 cm (8 inches) deep. Activity continued until 650 CE. In combination with other eruptions from nearby Imbabura, Mojanda, Cotacachi, and Cayambe, Cuicocha is responsible for the fertile soil of the Otavalo Valley. The Cuicocha Lake, a crater lake within the Cuicocha caldera contains four dacitic lava domes which form two steep forested islands: Yerovi, the smaller, and Teodoro Wolf, the larger. People are prohibited on both. The rim of the caldera is extremely steep -- so steep, in fact, that the accumulation of sediment is insufficient for most hydrophyte vegetation. An older lava dome from the Pleistocene forms part of the eastern rim. The lake, which is 200 m (656 ft) deep at its deepest point, is highly alkaline and contains little life. It has no known outlet. The intra-caldera islands, on the other hand, support some wildlife, most notably the silvery grebe, which lives around the reeds and feeds on small fish, frogs, crayfish, small water snakes, seeds of water plants, and insects. The bird is found in upper temperate and lower páramo zones throughout the Andes, but little is known about the species. In 1974 a census was taken of the population of grebes at Cuicocha and 44 birds were found. Cuicocha forms the southern end of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve. During the second day of Inti Raymi (or Sun Festival) every summer solstice, indigenous shaman use Cuicocha as a bath for ritual cleansing and purification.

While lighter weight classes are regularly ignored in wrestling promotions in the United States, with most emphasis placed on \\"heavyweights\\", more emphasis is placed on the lighter classes in Mexican companies. The official definition of the middleweight division in Mexico is a person between and , but the weight limits are not strictly adhered to. As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is not won via legitimate competition; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match or on occasion awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. El Cuatrero is the reigning champion, having defeated Ángel de Oro for the title on January 19, 2018, at Fantastica Mania, a joint show held by CMLL and New Japan Pro Wrestling. Dragón Rojo Jr. is the longest reigning champion in the history of the championship. Since its creation in 1991, there have been 19 individual championship reigns shared between 15 wrestlers. El Dandy is the only three-time champion; he also has the shortest reign of any champion at 63 days. History The middleweight division was one of the first weight divisions in Mexican lucha libre to have a specific championship as the Mexican National Middleweight Championship was created in 1933. When the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Enterprise\\"; EMLL) was founded in September 1933, they became one of several Mexican promotions to promote the championship. EMLL later created the World Middleweight Championship to represent the highest level prize of the middleweight division, higher than the Mexican National Middleweight Championship. In 1952, EMLL joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and changed the title to the NWA World Middleweight Championship. Averno, the 13th CMLL World Middleweight Champion In the late 1980s, EMLL left the NWA over internal politics, and by 1991 they had changed their name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (\\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) to distance themselves from the NWA. At first, they continued to use the name \\"NWA World Middleweight Championship\\" as the name had originated with EMLL, but they soon created a series of CMLL-branded world championships, including the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, which became the third middleweight championship in the company. CMLL held a one-night, eight-man tournament to determine the first middleweight champion on December 18, 1991. The tournament final saw Blue Panther defeat El Satánico to become the first new titleholder. In June 1992, many wrestlers left CMLL to join the newly formed Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (\\"Assistance, Assessment, and Administration\\"; AAA), which significantly affected CMLL's middleweight championships. The Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission allowed AAA to assume control of the Mexican National Middleweight Championship as the reigning champion Octagón had joined AAA. Meanwhile, the CMLL World Middleweight Championship was vacated after the departure of the champion, Blue Panther. CMLL held a 16-man battle royal match to reduce the field to two finalists. El Dandy and Negro Casas survived the match, and a week later El Dandy defeated Casas to become the second CMLL World Middleweight Champion. The championship has not been vacant since then. The exodus from CMLL to AAA also meant that CMLL lost control of the Mexican National Middleweight Championship as then-reigning champion Octagón was among the wrestlers that left the promotion. The Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission allowed AAA to take control of the Mexican National Middleweight Championship at that point in time. On August 12, 2010, CMLL returned the NWA World Middleweight Championship to the NWA, but immediately replaced it with the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship to keep two \\"world\\" level championships in the middleweight division. On May 3, 2010, Jushin Thunder Liger defeated Negro Casas to win the CMLL World Middleweight Championship. The match took place in Fukuoka, Japan, which was the first time the championship changed hands outside of Mexico and also marked the first time a non-Mexican wrestler held the championship. Reigns alt=Picture of a masked Japanese wrestler wearing an elaborate red mask with horns. El Cuatrero is the current champion, having won the title on January 19, 2018, from Ángel de Oro. This is El Cuatrero's first reign as middleweight champion; he is the 19th overall champion. Dragón Rojo Jr. is the wrestler who has held the championship the longest, a total of . El Dandy holds the record for most CMLL World Middleweight Championship reigns with three and is one of only three wrestlers to hold the title more than once, the others being Negro Casas and Emilio Charles Jr. El Dandy also held the record for the shortest reignhis second lasted only 63 days. Rules The official definition of the middleweight division in Mexico is from to . In the 20th century, CMLL was generally consistent and strict about enforcing the actual weight limits, but in the 21st century the official definitions have at times been overlooked for certain champions. One example of this was when Mephisto, officially listed as , won the CMLL World Welterweight Championship, a weight class with an upper limit. With twelve CMLL-promoted championships labelled as \\"World\\" titles, the promotional focus shifts from championship to championship over time with no single championship consistently promoted as the \\"main\\" championship; instead CMLL's various major shows feature different weight divisions and are most often headlined by a Lucha de Apuestas (\\"Bet match\\") instead of a championship match. From 2013 until June 2016, only two major CMLL shows have featured championship matches: Sin Salida in 2013 and the 2014 Juicio Final show featuring the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship. Championship matches usually take place under best two-out-of-three falls rules. On occasion, single-fall title matches have taken place, especially when promoting CMLL title matches in Japan, conforming to the traditions of the local promotion, illustrated by Jushin Thunder Liger winning the championship during New Japan Pro Wrestling's Wrestling Dontaku 2010 in a single-fall match. Tournaments 1991 In 1991, CMLL held an eight-man, one-night tournament to crown the first ever CMLL World Middleweight Champion. In the end, Blue Panther won the championship by defeating El Satánico. 1992 Due to a large number of wrestlers leaving the company in the summer of 1992, the middleweight championship was vacated, forcing CMLL to hold a tournament. They opted to start out with a 16-man battle royal elimination match as a means to qualify for the final match the following week. Negro Casas and El Dandy outlasted a field of wrestlers that consisted of Guerrero Maya, Águila Solitaria, Ponzona, Guerrero del Futuro, Plata, Espectro de Ultratumba, Espectro Jr., Oro, Javier Cruz, Kung Fu, Kato Kung Lee, Ringo Mendoza, Bestia Salvaje and Último Dragón. The following week El Dandy defeated Casas to start his first of three championship reigns.

Spillane (July 13, 1933 – May 13, 1977) was an Irish-American mobster who controlled Hell's Kitchen in New York in the 1960s and 1970s. Spillane, \\"the so-called Gentleman Gangster\\", was a marked contrast to the violent Westies mob members who succeeded him in Hell's Kitchen. Life Spillane was born on July 13, 1933 to Michael Anthony Spillane and Margaret Curran. Social Security Applications & Claims Index May 1977New York Daily News obituary 15 May 1977 At 16 or 17, he attempted to rob a movie theater, but was shot by a police officer. He spent four years in prison.The Irish Mob, Ep 2: The Irish in Hell's Kitchen - Mickey Spillane & Jimmy Coonan After his release from prison, Spillane started as a numbers runner for various organized crime figures in Hell's Kitchen. In 1960, Mickey took over the rackets left to him by his predecessor Hughie Mulligan. He married Maureen McManus, the daughter of the powerful Hell’s Kitchen Democratic district leader Eugene McManus. Though Italian mobsters dominated organized crime in the city, the Italian mob stayed out of Hell's Kitchen while Spillane was the boss. Often, Spillane would kidnap members of the Italian Mafia and hold them for ransom to raise money for his operations. Although he ran the rackets such as gambling and loansharking, he never allowed the sale of drugs. It was Spillane's refusal to allow the Italian mobsters to participate in the rackets in Hell’s Kitchen and along the west side of Manhattan that led to his downfall. The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was being built on Spillane's westside. The amount of money the new convention center was going to generate was enormous. Coupled with the amount Spillane was already generating from Madison Square Garden, the Hudson River waterfront and the local unions and Spillane would have been powerful enough to challenge the Italians for control of the city. So began the infamous Irish-Italian Mob War of 1970s. Irish- Italian Mob War  In the 1970s, under Spillane, the Irish mob became organized and expanded their control out of Hell’s Kitchen to most of the west side of Manhattan. The Italian Mafia, seeing this as a threat, demanded involvement in the soon-to-be-built Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The convention center was being constructed in the Chelsea neighborhood of NYC just south of Hell's Kitchen. Spillane refused to allow any involvement by the Italians. The Italian gangsters greatly outnumbered the members of the Irish mob, but Spillane was successful in keeping control of the convention center. The Italians, frustrated and embarrassed by their defeat to Spillane and the Irish gangsters, responded by hiring a rogue Irish-American hitman named Joseph \\"Mad Dog\\" Sullivan to assassinate Tom Devaney, Eddie \\"the Butcher\\" Cummiskey, and Tom \\"the Greek\\" Kapatos, three of Spillane's chief lieutenants. By the mid-1970s, Spillane had moved his family out of Hell's Kitchen to Woodside, Queens, because of threats of violence against his children. In 1966, a young upstart named Jimmy Coonan began slowly muscling in on Spillane’s territory. Ultimately, Coonan was sent to prison for ten years in 1967 for homicide. When he was released from prison, Coonan sought to align himself with the Gambino crime family through an up-and-coming mobster from Brooklyn, named Roy DeMeo. This would mark the beginning of the end for the Irish mob, as after Spillane‘s death, Coonan would eventually work for the Gambinos. Death On May 13, 1977, Spillane, aged 43, was killed outside his apartment in Queens. It has long been rumored that DeMeo murdered Spillane as a favor to Coonan, who subsequently took over as the boss of the Hell's Kitchen Irish Mob. Spillane is buried in Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York. Family Spillane had three children. Michael (Mickey), Robert and Denise. Robert, an actor, fell six stories to his death on July 10, 2010, in Manhattan, New York, when he leaned against his apartment window screen. The screen gave way while Robert may have been calling his brother. The Spillane family own the bar in Hell's Kitchen called \\"Mickey Spillane's Hells Kitchen\\" on 49th Street and 9th Avenue. In popular culture Mickey Spillane is portrayed by Mark Noonan in a season one episode of the HBO television series The Deuce. See also *List of unsolved murders References Books *Clark, Neil G.

The four met at Savannah College of Art and Design during their first year. After graduation, Stickney and Hinton both left the band. Bavosa, Brian https://relix.com/articles/detail/perpetual_groove_redemption_song/ Relix In 2001, drummer Albert Suttle and keyboardist Matt McDonald, both then active-duty members of the US Army, met Butler and Perry at a Savannah open- mic night and soon joined Perpetual Groove. After moving out of Savannah, they settled in the musically dominated college-town of Athens, GA - home of R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B52's and many more musical acts over the years. The band first attracted attention at Jake's Roadhouse in Atlanta and JJ Cagney's on Savannah's Bay Street, which eventually relocated to River Street and later became The Live Wire Music Hall. They played a very notable show at J. J. Cagney's, which was a private party for the cast and crew of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil with several other local bands, including The Eric Culberson Trio and a group called \\"Ciaxa\\" led by Joe and Eric Layden, who would later form the international jam/funk revue band \\"The Looters\\". Actors Paul Hipp and Jack Thompson also performed with the bands. As crowds grew, they played larger venues such as Loco's, the [Lucas Theater] (New Year's Eve 2003), SCAD's [Trustees Theater], the Armstrong Center at Armstrong Atlantic State University and [The Roundhouse Railroad Museum]. In 2006, PGroove started playing hometown benefit concerts for the Jolly Foundation, in honor of Butler's childhood friend Mary Ellen McKee. Also in 2006, PGroove relocated from Savannah to Athens, Georgia. The Georgia Theatre in Athens had become one of the band's main venues prior to the move, prompting the idea for a new homebase. PGroove's first wider US tour was in 2003. They toured the country extensively, gaining a new legion of die-hard fans in New England and the Northeast, and a strong following on the West Coast, along with an ever- growing fan-base in the South.

The band hosted their own gathering every Memorial Day weekend known as \\"Amberland\\". It began as a party for friends and family on the property of Mark Day in Jefferson, GA, but had outgrown its Jackson County roots and relocated each year. From 2007 to 2012, Amberland was held at Cherokee Farms, just outside LaFayette in northwest Georgia. The band played long sets over the weekend and Brock Butler traditionally played an acoustic set, known as BrockFest on Sunday mornings during the weekend. Amberland X (May 2011) was the first of the festivals to feature opening acts, with bands like Moon Taxi, Zoogma, Mantras, Under The Porch, Former Champions, and Noise[Org] who all opened for P-Groove during their regular touring seasons.

Huffer is now working full-time with the band moe. [This is no longer true as of 2015]. Josey Hunt shortly worked as the lighting designer, and now works at the Georgia Theatre in Athens, GA. Matt Mercier and Owen Pike of Liquid Lux Light Design toured with the band from late summer 2011 until April 2013, bringing innovative programming, creative rigs and ever expanding equipment to the P-Groove lighting experience.

It occurs because a system of liquid and gas at equilibrium will see a net conversion of liquid to gas as pressure lowers, for example, liquids reach their boiling point at lower temperatures when the pressure on them is lowered. Symptoms Symptoms of ebullismCzarnik, Tam, \\"Ebullism at 1 Million Feet\\" (Retrieved 2010-02-16). include bubbles in the membranes of the mouth and eyes, swelling of the skin, and bubbles in the blood. Blood circulation and breathing may be impaired or stopped. The brain tissue may be starved of oxygen because of blockage of arteries, and the lungs may swell and hemorrhage. Death results unless recompression is rapid enough to reduce the bubbles before tissue damage occurs. In 1960, Joseph Kittinger experienced localised ebullism during a ascent in a helium-driven gondola. His right-hand glove failed to pressurise and his hand expanded to roughly twice its normal volume\\"Skydive from the Stratosphere\\", NOVA Online, Public Broadcasting Service(PBS). November 2000. Retrieved 2012-09-23 accompanied by disabling pain. His hand took about 3 hours to recover after his return to the ground. Mechanism In the atmospheric pressure present at sea level, water boils at . At an altitude of , it boils at only , the normal body temperature of humans. This altitude is known as Armstrong’s Line.Davis, Jeffrey R., Johnson, Robert, and Stepanek,Jan, Fundamentals of Aerospace Medicine, 4th Edition (2008), p. 252. In practice bodily fluids do not boil off at this altitude. This is because the skin and outer organs have enough strength to withstand this pressure,Landis, Geoffrey A., \\"Human Exposure to Vacuum \\" (Retrieved 2010-02-16). thus pressure inside the body would be significantly higher—however, bubbles starting to form is still an issue. Prevention To prevent ebullism, a pure oxygen (O2) atmosphere was used in early space flights to eliminate nitrogen in the blood. There are major fire hazards associated with using pure O2 as a breathing gas, which was central to the death of three astronauts in a fire during a ground test with Apollo 1. Nonetheless NASA continued to use a [nominally] pure oxygen atmosphere throughout the Apollo Program but switched to air for the follow-on Space Transport System \\"Space Shuttle\\". Russian cosmonauts used pure oxygen before changing to a higher-pressure nitrox mixture, leading to incompatibility problems in 1975 on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Space suits are often pressurized to several psi lower than stations' capsules or shuttles and since they still use pure O2, an acclimation period is common in the airlock to remove nitrogen and other gases from the bloodstream. Etymology The term \\"space ebullism\\" was introduced by Captain Julian E. Ward in his paper \\"The True Nature of the Boiling of Body Fluids in Space\\", published in Aviation Medicine in October of 1956. It was suggested \\"because the word ebullism does not connote the addition of heat to produce vapor.\\" It comes from Latin ebullire, meaning \\"to bubble out, or to boil up.\\"  See also    References  Category:Medical terminology Category:Space medicine ","title":"Ebullism"},{"id":"4505572","text":"The New Quiz Kids was a short-lived television series, based on the 1950s game show Quiz Kids.

According to Eysenck, MacLeod & Mathews (1987), the dot- probe task was inspired by some data collected by Halkiopoulos, one of Michael Eysenck's students, in 1981, assessing attentional biases to threatening auditory information, when threatening and non-threatening information was presented simultaneously to both ears in a dichotic listening task (Halkiopoulos (1981)Mathews, 1990). The method was adapted to the visual modality (also known as the visual-probe task) by MacLeod, Mathews and Tata (1986). In many cases, the dot-probe paradigm is used to assess selective attention to threatening stimuli in individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorders. Biases have also been investigated in other disorders via this paradigm, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain. Attention biases toward positive stimuli have been associated with a number of positive outcomes such as increased social engagement, increased prosocial behavior, decreased externalizing disorders, and decreased emotionally withdrawn behavior. Procedure and method During the dot-probe task, participants are situated in front of a computer screen and asked to stare at a fixation cross on the center of the screen. Two stimuli, one of which is neutral and one of which is threatening, appear randomly on either side of the screen. The stimuli are presented for a predetermined length of time (most commonly 500ms), before a dot is presented in the location of one former stimulus. Participants are instructed to indicate the location of this dot as quickly as possible, either via keyboard or response box. Latency is measured automatically by the computer. The fixation cross appears again for several seconds and then the cycle is repeated. Quicker reaction time to the dot when it occurs in the previous location of a threatening stimulus is interpreted as vigilance to threat. Clinical uses Researchers have recently begun using a modified version of the dot-probe task to retrain the attentional bias. In this version, the probe replaces the neutral stimuli 100% of the time or the salient stimuli 100% of the time. Over the course of a number of trials the attentional bias for salient stimuli can be reduced (in the case of the 'replace-neutral' condition) or enhanced (in the case of the 'replace-salient' condition).Mathews, A., & MacLeod, C. (2002). Induced processing biases have causal effects on anxiety. Cognition & Emotion, 16(3), 331-354. This method of retraining the attentional bias is called attentional retraining.

K. Chambers, was an English literary critic and Shakespearean scholar. His four-volume work on The Elizabethan Stage, published in 1923, remains a standard resource. Biography Chambers was born in West Ilsley, Berkshire. His father was a curate there and his mother the daughter of a Victorian theologian. He was educated at Marlborough College, before matriculating at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He won a number of prizes, including the chancellor's prize in English for an essay on literary forgery. He took a job with the national education department, and married Eleanor Bowman in 1893. In the newly created Board of Education, Chambers worked principally to oversee adult and continuing education. He rose to be second secretary, but the work for which he is remembered took place outside the office, at least before he retired from the Board in 1926. He was the first president of the Malone Society, serving from 1906 to 1939. He edited collections of verse for Oxford University Press. He produced a work on King Arthur and a privately printed collection of poems. However, Chambers's great work, begun even before he left Oxford and pursued for three decades, was a great examination of the history and conditions of English theatre in the medieval and Renaissance periods. This study, which Chambers (in the preface to Elizabethan Stage) called prolegomena to a \\"little book on Shakespeare\\", was published in three bursts. The Medieval Stage, issued in 1903, offered a comprehensive survey of medieval theatre, covering not only the fairly well- known interludes, but also the then-obscure folk drama, minstrelsy, and liturgical drama. The Elizabethan Stage followed after two decades. The work, though it contained less original discovery than its predecessor, remains among the most useful depictions of the material conditions of English Renaissance theatre. W. W. Greg described it as \\"one of those books which perhaps no living person is in a position to criticise adequately.\\" It remains in use today. In 1930 came at last the two-volume work on Shakespeare, which collected and analysed the extant evidence of Shakespeare's work and life. In his retirement, Chambers produced works on Coleridge and Matthew Arnold. After moving to Eynsham, Oxfordshire, he returned to medieval history, producing a volume in the Oxford history and a local study of Eynsham. He died in 1954. Chambers was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1912, KBE in 1925. In 1924, he was elected fellow of the British Academy and his biography Samuel Taylor Coleridge was awarded the 1938 James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

The son of Bengals co-founder and original coach of the Cleveland Browns, Paul Brown, he joined the Bengals upon their founding in 1968 and assumed ownership of the team after his father's death. Brown's ownership has been criticized for a lack of on-field success, his refusal to cede football operations to a general manager, and the team's relationship with Hamilton County before and after a voter-approved tax increase to fund Paul Brown Stadium.

Bengals Reach the Bottom, And They Keep Getting Worse, The New York Times, D1 In an unusual meeting between future sports owners, eventual New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner hired him to a summer job as a deck hand for Kinsman Marine Transit Company. Brown eventually followed his father into football management. Paul Brown founded the Bengals, then an American Football League team, in 1968. (This was several years after Paul Brown was dismissed as Cleveland Browns head coach in a well-publicized falling out with Art Modell.) He began his executive duties with the Bengals as assistant general manager. Along with personnel decisions, he was a spokesman for the team on issues of league rules and team policy.Daly, Dan, 1990, August 10, Speaking of money, why not just stop, The Washington Times, D1.Dodd, Mike, 1990, November 8, Unblinking eye spies on NFL refs; Is replay use counterproductive?, USA Today, 8C. Taking over the team Brown assumed ownership responsibilities upon his father's death in August 1991 and has remained in the ownership position since.

The Bengals hold a number of distinctions for the time frame of Brown's ownership: It is the only team with three nine-game-or-more losing streaks. It also holds six of the twenty-five 0-6 starts (24%)https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap- sameoldbengals&prov;=ap&type;=lgns%20Bengals%20back%20to%20setting%20standard%20for%20misery and four of the thirteen 0-8 starts (31%) in that time. The Bengals have gone winless in October nine different times in twenty-two years under five different head coaches (Sam Wyche, the first under his ownership, was originally hired by Paul Brown). Additionally, the team has obtained the NFL's longest active drought for playoff wins during his tenure, with their last playoff win occurring the year before Brown became owner in 1990. The most successful coach during Mike Brown's tenure is Marvin Lewis, who is the only head coach under Brown to have winning seasons, playoff appearances, division titles, and an overall winning record at 131-129-3 (.504). All seven of the Bengals postseason appearances under Lewis, however, ended in first-round losses. In 2009, Yahoo sports ranked Mike Brown as the second worst owner in the NFL. In 2015 Rolling Stone ranked Mike Brown as the 9th worst sports owner. Philosophy In addition to being majority owner, Brown is considered the Bengals' de facto general manager as well. He is one of two NFL owners who have either the title or powers of general manager, the other being Dallas' Jerry Jones. In 2009, The Cincinnati Enquirer publicized details of testimony in a Hamilton County Probate Court trial over the $300 million estate of Austin Knowlton. Brown testified that he received a general manager bonus every year since he took over the team in 1991.http://news.cincinnati.com/assets/AB133506424.PDF Due to the team's record under his ownership, Brown has been subject to criticism for his approach to the running the football side of the Bengals' organization. Since 2009, however, Brown has largely ceded day-to-day control over football matters to a committee comprising executive vice president Katie Blackburn (Brown's daughter), then head coach Marvin Lewis, and several other members of the Brown family. Following this change the Bengals made the playoffs from 2011-2015.Wesseling, Chris. Mike Brown ceding Bengals control to Marvin Lewis. NFL Network, 2014-07-27. Tolerance of off field conduct In the mid-to- late 2000s, the Bengals were involved in a series of disciplinary measures with a variety of players. In 2005, the Bengals drafted Chris Henry and Odell Thurman, each considered exceptionally talented but possible disciplinary hazards during their college careers.Newberry, Paul. 2004, September 30.

Later in 2008, the Bengals signed running back Cedric Benson, whom the Chicago Bears had waived, in part, due to his off-field activities.Kay, Joe. 2008, November 5. Benson has become Bengals' top runner, Associated Press Online.

Benson was among 2009's leading NFL rushers, while Johnson saw limited action. In recent years, Brown claims to have rethought this approach. Talking about the team's second appearance on Hard Knocks, Brown stated, \\"We have a different team now than we had a few years ago. We want the public to see them. We think they're good people.

Easy to understand agony of Cincinnati, The Toronto Star, B3. Shula was hired over Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Bill Cowher, presumably due to Brown seeing similarities with himself and Shula in the same manner that their respective fathers (Don Shula and Paul Brown) overshadow them in many aspects. Cowher would take the head coaching position with the rival Pittsburgh Steelers that same offseason and would go on to have a 22-9 career record against the Bengals, the most wins he would have against any team as a head coach, including an 8-1 record against Shula. Cowher also beat the Bengals in the 2006 wild card game as well and went on to win a Super Bowl title that year.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrcCbmeJuuU Shula's successor, Bruce Coslet, resigned with a 21-39 record in 2000; Brown had yet to fire him.Myers, Gary. 2000, October 1. Bruce finally loose, Daily News (New York), p. 77. Cincinnati's first winning seasons and postseason appearances during Brown's ownership came under head coach Marvin Lewis, who obtained a 131-122-3 regular season record with the team and helped the Bengals return to competitiveness. However, Brown was criticized for continuing to retain Lewis after the Bengals lost all seven of the playoff games they appeared in during Lewis' tenure. Following five consecutive opening-round postseason losses from 2011 to 2015, an NFL first, and back-to-back losing seasons in 2016 and 2017, Lewis received a two-year contract extension, which received harsh criticism from the media and fans.http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/01/02/marvin-lewis-bengals- agree-to-two-more-years/ When Brown and Lewis mutually parted ways in 2018, Lewis' 16-year tenure became the most of an NFL head coach to not win a playoff game. Brown also values his family's connection with the franchise; evident in his choosing to name Paul Brown Stadium after his father rather than to sell corporate naming rights for it.Rozin, Skip. 2000, September 11.

Esiason became a color analyst on ABC's Monday Night Football. Collinsworth suggested Brown \\"thought he was doing the right thing by Boomer\\" and did not want to cost him the MNF job. Collinsworth contrasted this attitude to other NFL owners, like the Dallas Cowboys' Jerry Jones, whom Collinsworth felt \\"would have flown Boomer down to the Bahamas on his personal jet, offered to kiss his ring and signed him right there.\\"http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1998/12/26/spt_mb2020.html Scouting Brown employs a very small scouting staff.

Klingler later became regarded as a bust. Esiason has since revealed that he had actually demanded a trade at the end of the 1991 season, which may have influenced Brown to select Klingler (Esiason was traded to the New York Jets in 1993).

He said that Brown 'is a very, very, very stubborn man'. Andy Dalton was taken in the 2011 NFL Draft and became the first QB in franchise history to lead the team to the playoffs five years in a row, although the Bengals were eliminated in the first round each year. Dalton did not play in what became the fifth consecutive loss due to injury. \\"Carl Pickens Clause\\" In 1998, the Bengals cut punter Lee Johnson. Brown attempted to fine Johnson after cutting him for \\"conduct detrimental to the team\\" in relation to comments Johnson had made about the organization and the 1998 season. A reporter asked Johnson after a Bengals loss \\"if you were a fan, would you have come here today?\\" to which Johnson replied \\"No, no way...why would you? You're saying (losing) is OK.

He wrote an editorial for the Cincinnati Enquirer, citing team cohesion as his main motivation for the clause. It is often dubbed the \\"Carl Pickens Clause,\\" stemming from the 2000 offseason.

History  When the University developed the George Square area in the 1960s, a huge swathe of Georgian Edinburgh was demolished, leading to accusations of cultural vandalism and megalomania. The Appleton Tower was intended as the first phase of the proposed interlinked Fundamental Science buildings, in a development that would have covered much of the South Side.George Square 1876-1976 The Tower was named in posthumous honour of physicist Sir Edward Appleton, the Principal who oversaw the development from vision into concrete reality of the George Square redevelopment. In the post-war period, vociferous support for the George Square scheme, and impassioned opposition to it, were so intense as to elevate it to a national debate. Thus, many were glad that some of Appleton's vision was not completed.  Design  Designed by Alan Reiach, Eric Hall and Partners, the building included seven floors of laboratory accommodation, surmounting a double-height circulation concourse, with various facilities provided in its podium. A block containing five lecture theatres clad in conglomerate concrete and pebble-imbedded slabs is attached to its southern side. The tower's completion in 1966 created a symbolic manifestation of Appleton's vision for integration of the arts and sciences, with the twin towers of David Hume (Arts, now called 40 George Square) and Appleton (Sciences), dominating the University's Central area. An associated teaching block for east George Square, and a Mathematics and Physics building for the ‘car park site’ on north Crichton Street, were intended to interlock at this sector. The latter project was relocated to King's Buildings in the 1960s, resulting in the James Clerk Maxwell Building; the succeeding project for the site, the Dental Hospital and School, was abandoned for lack of funding. The Tower was left isolated - and without a proper entrance, as this had been intended to be via connection to further construction. Appleton Tower was built to allow first-year science students to be taught in the university's Central area. It has five lecture theatres, together accommodating around 1,200 students, and several smaller seminar and tutorial rooms. The upper floors originally housed teaching laboratories, which, with the development of more modern facilities at King's Buildings, had become outdated by the end of the 20th century.  Refurbishment in 2006  Three floors (3-5) of the building have been used by the School of Informatics since the Edinburgh Cowgate fire in December 2002. These have been completely refurbished, creating a modern environment for teaching and research, although research has all but completely moved completely to the Informatics Forum. The five lecture theatres and teaching space on the ground and first floors were refurbished over the summer of 2006, and the remaining floors (basement and 6-8) were renovated in 2007.  Recladding  The Tower's external cladding of pre- cast concrete slabs with mosaic detailing had suffered badly from the Scottish weather, and in 2014 the university received permission for the recladding of the exterior, a reworking of the podium including the creation of a proper entrance, and integrating the Tower with the surrounding environment of Edinburgh's Southside. The refurbishment was completed on 7 November 2017.  Context  Although the Fundamental Science Buildings were not completed, preparatory demolition of Bristo Street to form the adjoining Crichton Street site left the University with an embarrassing gap site, which remained as an open, windswept car park for over forty years. The 2007 completion of the interior renovation of Appleton Tower coincides with further development of the surrounding area; the Crichton Street Car Park closed in 2005 to allow construction of the Informatics Forum, which was completed in 2008.  Criticism   Outwards appearance  Geneticist Steve Jones has nominated \\"the ugliness of the Appleton Tower\\" as one of the wonders of the world for a BBC2 TV show. Early in 2005, a student newspaper launched a campaignhttp://www.studentnewspaper.org/view_article.php?article_id=20050228170439 to nominate it for the Channel 4 series Demolition - a series about the \\"worst buildings in Britain\\". The Tower did not make the final twelve. Later, in the same year, Historic Scotland considered giving the building listed status, but after opposition it was removed from the list.Scotsman.com News Edinburgh Fringe During the Edinburgh Festival Fringe each August, the building is used by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society as a hub for performers and press, and goes by the name of Fringe Central.

Goodna is from the Brisbane central business district, being just outside the Brisbane City Council area. Located as a centre point between Brisbane and Ipswich, it was designated by the Queensland Government in the SEQ Plan as a major activity centre, a transport oriented development centre and as an economic activity centre. The Brisbane River runs to the north of Goodna. Goodna Boat Ramp is one of the only boat ramps on the Brisbane River and is part of the Brisbane River Canoe Trail. There are extensive old Jacaranda, Poinciana, Hoop Pine and Mango trees throughout the area. Parks are widespread with over 14 individual parks to be found and free electric barbecue facilities at the major ones. Names of some of the major parks include: Evan Marginson Sportsground, Richardson Park, Leslie Park, Kippen Park, Norma Mulvihill Park, Baines Meaney and Seymour Park. Fifty percent of The Pan Pacific Peace Gardens is also situated within Goodna. Wildlife is restricted with ongoing development, however possums and on a rare occasion koalas have also been spotted and kangaroos are numerous, especially near the golf courses. Goodna Shopping Centre (also known as St Ives) is a major shopping centre, an easy walk to the Goodna train station ( direct distance). Many of the original central street names in Goodna originated from English kings, princes, and queens such as William, Albert, James and George. History Goodna is in Yerongpan country; that is, the land controlled by the local Aboriginal tribe of Yerongpan at the time of British settlement. The Yerongpan people spoke a dialect of the Yuggera/Jagera Durubulic language group (not to be confused with the Jagera tribe or its Jagera dialect) and continue their culture today. In 1823 John Oxley led an exploration party who were the first Europeans to visit the area. The area had extensive beds of sandstone. In 1826 Patrick Logan established the Woogaroo Quarry to provide building materials for the Moreton Bay penal colony. The district was known as Woogaroo derived from Woogaroo Creek, which in turn appears on the 1840 map of Moreton Bay District prepared by surveyor Robert Dixon. The name Woogaroo is derived from Yuggera language, Yugarabul dialect, indicating shady or cool.Ready for the hunt ca. 1892 Goodna Royal Mail Hotel. As early as 1841 there was a sheep run called Woogaroo Station belonging to H.S.Russell and Dr. Stephen Simpson. Simpson was the lands commissioner and magistrate for the Moreton Bay district, and lived in a slab hut while he farmed on the riverbank near the mouth of Woogaroo Creek. As the main road intersected with the track from Coopers Plains and the river, it was a strategic location for Simpson. The Grenier family of South Brisbane came from New Zealand to Brisbane in 1845 and, while operating the Grenier Inn at South Brisbane, also farmed land known as \\"The Willows\\" where Archerfield Airport stands today. This name, which referred to a waterhole in the creek was superseded from 1865 onwards by the name Goodna. In 1851–1852 Simpso purchased of land, including on Wolston Creek. Other well known pioneers settled or purchased land in the Goodna area: James Holmes arrived in 1851 and established himself as a grazier; Charles Pitt married Thomas Grenier's daughter Mary in 1855 and grew cotton and maize at Redbank Plains. According to \\"Aldines History of Queensland\\" Pitt was the second to grow cotton in that area and received £400 from the New South Wales Government (the establishment of Queensland did not occur until 1859). Pitt was also a JP and later on the Purga Divisional Board and involved in the beginnings of the Redbank School. Harriet Holmes bought in 1860; and Joshua Jeays, later Mayor of Brisbane, bought in the next year. \\"Penhelyg\\" Queenslander in William St Goodna built in 1896. Historically Goodna was a farming community, primarily in sugar, cotton, livestock (sheep and cattle), and also had a large local timber industry. Large amounts of timber were taken by bullock teams to the Goodna wharf and shipped to Ipswich and Brisbane.Six Mile Woogaroo and Goodna Creek. Ipswich City Council. Retrieved on 28 December 2011. Further settlement took place after Goodna was proclaimed a village in 1856. In the following year Joseph and Ellen (née Thompson) Broad built a store on the site, and sold the store later to Edwin Pitt, son of Charles and Mary Pitt. Edwin and his wife Cecilia (née Thompson sister of Ellen Broad) ran the store as a mixed business and Cecilia was the postmistress (see Aldines). They survived the 1893 Brisbane flood but a little later built Pitt's Hotel Cecil on the store site. It was later burnt down and the RSL is now on that site. Edwin and Cecilia's daughter Zora Brenda Pitt grew up and learnt to ride in Goodna and she became Royal National Show champion woman rider in the early 1900s. The cemetery opened in 1859. Apiary at Goodna ca. 1913.By 1863 there was a small run to Holmes Inn, where Harriet Holmes was postmistress. The Congregational Church was also opened in 1863. It was built by Mr ES Thomas who was also the lay preacher. Mr Thomas was an Ipswich Councillor and the local JP. As a JP he also filled the role of acting magistrate on occasions. He built the now heritage-listed house at 43 William Street and owned the adjacent general store and bakery. Thomas originally operated a general store in Brisbane Road but this was flooded in 1893. They had to move their best things into the top floor of the nearby hotel. There was one acting police sergeant and a constable by 1868. W. Law established himself as a blacksmith in 1870. Goodna State School opened on 1 February 1870. A pre-school was added in 1975. On 30 January 1873 the ceremony of \\"turning the sod\\" for the first rail link between Ipswich and Brisbane took place at Goodna. Two thousand people attended the event, most arriving by paddle steamer. To officially start the work, the Queensland Governor George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby, used a solid silver spade to dig a small piece of earth and place it in a wheelbarrow. Cobb and Co coaches stopped at Goodna on their way to and from Brisbane (their only other stops were Oxley and Rocklea). This ended after the railway link was completed in 1875. The foundation stone of St Patrick's Catholic Church had been laid in 1880 by Bishop James Quinn and the church opened in the following year. It was later renamed St Francis Xavier Catholic Church. Daniel Jones built the first sawmill in 1884, which was located below the Catholic Church/School grounds in the paddock that reached from Mill Street to Alice Street (known by locals as 'the mill paddock'). In the smaller paddock immediately behind the Presbyterian Church and Manse stood the wooden 'Honey Shed' used by Daniel's brother Harry in conjunction with his apiary. By World War II this use had been discontinued and the site was used by a group of CWA ladies who made camouflage nets for the war effort. The site was also used at one time by the Goodna Scout Group. By 1888 the population of Goodna was 500, and there were three friendly societies, the Oddfellows, Loyal Rose of Denmark and Good Templars. St Patrick's Primary School was established on 3 July 1910 by the Sisters of Mercy, whose convent opened in 1911. Circa 1924 it was renamed St Francis Xavier's School.

The 2.03 m (6 foot 7 inch) by 3.58 m (11 foot 9 inch) canvas was started in 1880 and finished in 1891. Repin recorded the years of work along the lower edge of the canvas. Alexander III bought the painting for 35,000 rubles, at the time the greatest sum ever paid for a Russian painting. Since then, the canvas has been exhibited in the State Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg. Context Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks depicts a supposedly historical tableau, set in 1676, and based on the legend of Cossacks sending a reply to an ultimatum from the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmed IV. The original reply, if it ever existed, has not survived; however, in the 1870s an amateur ethnographer from Yekaterinoslav (today Dnipro), Ya. Novitsky, found a copy made in the 18th century. He gave it to historian Dmytro Yavornytsky (1855–1940), who by chance read it to his guests, among whom was the painter Ilya Repin. Repin became curious about the story and in 1880 started the first of his studies. According to the story, the Zaporozhian Cossacks (from \\"beyond the rapids\\", Ukrainian: za porohamy), inhabiting the lands around the lower Dnieper River in Ukraine, had defeated Ottoman Empire forces in battle. However, Mehmed demanded that the Cossacks submit to Ottoman rule. The Cossacks, led by Ivan Sirko, replied in an uncharacteristic manner: they wrote a letter, replete with insults and profanities. The painting exhibits the Cossacks' pleasure at striving to come up with ever more base vulgarities. During Repin's time, the Cossacks enjoyed great popular sympathy. Repin also admired them: \\"All that Gogol wrote about them is true! A holy people! No one in the world held so deeply freedom, equality, and fraternity.\\" Mehmed IV, Ottoman Sultan 1648–1687 The Cossacks' reply came as a stream of invective and vulgar rhymes: The version that is stored at the While working on the original version, Repin in 1889 began work on a second version. This work remained unfinished. The artist tried to make the second version of The Cossacks more \\"historically authentic\\". In 1932 it was transferred by the Tretyakov Gallery to the M. F. Sumtsov Kharkiv Historical Museum. In 1935, it was moved to the , where it is now stored. This canvas is slightly smaller than the original version. Vladimir Gilyarovsky, a popular journalist of partial Cossack descent, was one of the models who posed for Repin.

The municipality also comprises the Katastralgemeinden Faningberg, Neuseß and Steindorf. Geography It is located in the centre of the Salzburg Lungau region, in the valley of the Southern Taurach River, a tributary of the Mur rising at the Radstädter Tauern Pass. In the north, the Niedere Tauern range forms a part of the main chain of the Alps. In the south, the Katschberg Roads via Sankt Michael leads to the Tauern Autobahn and the Katschberg Pass, crossing the Hohe Tauern range towards Carinthia. History Mauterndorf Castle The settlement arose from a Roman castra in the Noricum province, at the mountain road from Teurnia to the Radstädter Tauern Pass and Iuvavum (Salzburg). Mauterndorf was first mentioned in a 1002 deed, Mauterndorf Castle was acquired by the Salzburg archbishops in 1023, who set up a toll (Maut) station and ceded the inhabitants market rights in 1217. From the 15th century, the fortress was significantly enlarged as a stronghold at the behest of the archbishops Burkhard Weisbriach and Leonhard von Keutschach. Mauterndorf received access to the Mur Valley Railway in October 1894, as the western terminus of the narrow gauge line leading to Tamsweg and Murau in Styria. Passenger service from Tamsweg to Mauterndorf ceased in 1973, the section is today used by the museal Taurach Railway. In 1894 Mauterndorf Castle was purchased by the German staff surgeon Hermann von Epenstein, godfather of Hermann Göring. Göring spent several times in his childhood at the castle and in 1939 inherited it from Epenstein's widow. At the end of World War II he fled to Mauterndorf. Leaving there, he surrendered to the US Army at Bruck an der Großglocknerstraße. Since 1968 the castle has been owned by the State of Salzburg. In 1985 Mauterndorf and was the site of the first- ever FAI World Glider Aerobatic Championships.

Pocket diaper with hook and loop closure Baby wearing pocket diaper with snap closure A cloth diaper (American English) or a cloth nappy (Australian English and British English) is a reusable diaper made from natural fibers, man-made materials, or a combination of both. They are often made from industrial cotton which may be bleached white or left the fiber’s natural color. Other natural fiber cloth materials include wool, bamboo, and unbleached hemp. Man-made materials such as an internal absorbent layer of microfiber toweling or an external waterproof layer of polyurethane laminate (PUL) may be used. Polyester fabrics microfleece or suedecloth are often used inside cloth diapers as a \\"stay-dry\\" wicking liner because of the non-absorbent properties of those synthetic fibers. Modern cloth diapers come in a host of shapes, including preformed cloth diapers, all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors, fitted diaper with covers and pocket or \\"stuffable\\" diapers, which consist of a water- resistant outer shell sewn with an opening for insertion of absorbent material inserts. Many design features of modern cloth diapers have followed directly from innovations initially developed in disposable diapers, such as the use of the hour glass shape, materials to separate moisture from skin and the use of double gussets, or an inner elastic band for better fit and containment of waste material. History Traditionally, cloth diapers consisted of a folded square or rectangle of linen cloth, cotton flannel, or stockinet, which was fastened with safety pins. Today, this type of diaper is referred to as a flat. The flat was commonly used in the late 1800s in Europe and North America. In the early part of the 20th century, cloth users were boiling diapers as they became aware of bacteria. During World War II, the increase of working mothers brought the need for the \\"diaper service\\". Fresh cotton diapers would be delivered on an as-needed basis. In 1946, a Westport housewife named Marion Donovan, invented the \\"Boater\\", a waterproof covering for cloth diapers. Marion was granted 4 patents for her designs, including the use of plastic snaps that replaced the traditional and dangerous \\"safety pins\\". In 1950, the prefold diaper was invented by a diaper service owner and produced by Curity. The prefold diaper consisted of a standard \\"flat\\" diaper, but pre-folded and sewn together. Also in 1950, the Safe-T Di-Dee diaper was invented. The diaper was preformed and was the first pinless, snap-on diaper- this was the first fitted diaper. It was invented by Sybil Geeslin (Kennedy) who subsequently sold the patent. They were then sold as Keystone Safe-T Di- Dee Diapers and were nationally distributed. In the 1960s, the disposable diaper rapidly took hold and cloth diaper use fell out of favor. The \\"Safe Diaper Clip,\\" an alternative to traditional safety pins, was invented and patented in 1961 by Edward Moonan of Boonville, NY. but never took off, due to drop in use of cloth diapers. In the late 1980s, cloth diaper users re-emerged with environmental issues concerning the use of disposables. By the late 1990s and the beginning of the next decade, many large cloth diaper manufacturing companies were well established. In 1987 Bummis, a Canadian company, invented the modern diaper cover to go over flats and prefolds. Also in 1987, the Snappi diaper fastener was invented in South Africa to be used with prefolds or flats and is still widely used today. In 1995, the Motherease company was formed and began selling by mail order in the US, although the owner (Erika Froese) had been developing and selling her diapers since 1991 (mostly in Canada) and using cloth since 1981. Motherease was . Catherine McDiarmid's BornToLove.com, a Canadian site, was one of the first major diaper websites to emerge in 1997 as the web took off. In 1999, Poochies and HoneyBoy! diapers were developed and , some selling for over $200.00 per diaper. Cuddlebuns Cloth Diapers were introduced to the diapering community in 1999 and were a one-size diaper that could fit babies from infancy to potty training with adjustable sizing. This is known today as a one-size diaper. All three of these diapers brand patterns eventually became available for the general public to sew through cottage licensing, and are now owned by BabyByYou! Also in 1999, Kissaluvs started an online business to sell fitted and contour diapers. These years also saw a tremendous amount of growth in the amount of moms who begin sewing their own diapers, referred to as \\"Work at Home Moms\\" or WAHMs. The UK market was slower to get started than the USA, with a few domestic manufacturers such as Earthwise and Snugglenaps being established in the late 1990s, alongside importers of brands such as Motherease, Bummis and Kooshies. The first multi-brand ecommerce online shop was opened by Twinkleontheweb, with others following on. The Real Nappy Association was formed by members of WEN the Women's Environmental Network, with the first Real Nappy Week being held in 1997 to promote the use of cloth diapers in the UK. In 2000, Fuzzi Bunz opened an online store selling the first pocket diaper. Originally, they were fleece on the outside and the inside. Later they were made with PUL (a waterproof laminated polyester fabric used in virtually all Cloth diaper covers today) outers and fleece inners. Both looks were different from what you see today. Other companies quickly followed suit, included TotsBots and Nature Babies in the UK, Baby Kicks, and Stacinator fleece diaper covers. The phrase \\"hyena\\" was also coined around this time, or shortly thereafter, when Kendell from Freshies commented on how all the diapering mamas were so ruthless in their stalking of hard-to-get diapers. She said, in a joking way, that \\"they're just like a pack of hyenas, closing in for the kill\\" and the term stuck. So now hyena diapers are the hard to get, but much sought after diaper brands available today. In 2003, \\"Wahm Boutique\\" and \\"Tuesday Bear\\" (the first WAHM congos for diapers) and other WAHM items were opened to the public. Also in 2003, wool soakers became , which resulted in a slew of WAHMs selling hand knit wool covers/soakers. In 2004 and 2005, the soakers evolved into wool longies or pants. Prefold with Snappi closure. A water proof cover will be added to prevent leaks. 2002 and 2003 are also known by many experienced cloth diapers WAHMS as the diaper war years. Larger cloth diaper companies began threatening smaller ones with legal action and accusations of pattern or patent infringement. Motherease threatened legal action as they tried to protect their pattern for the one size diaper, and Fuzzi Bunz threatened legal action to protect their patent on pocket diapers. Many small WAHM diaper makers closed, deciding that the industry was too cutthroat. In 2004, Karen Fegelman developed Hyena Cart, an online e-commerce site that became popular with WAHMS selling homemade cloth diapers. It has since been re-named Indie Cart. 2004 and 2005 were also the host to an explosion of growth in the cloth diapering community. Many new cloth diaper sewing and retail businesses were started. The presence of WAHM congos also saw a tremendous amount of growth. Also, in 2004 and 2005, designer diapers were the rage. Some more sought after brands can be sold at auction for $200–300.00, with some charity auctions bringing in over $500.00 for a single cloth diaper. Online forums exploded with cloth diapering communities (MDC taking the lead) and many new web sites dedicated to cloth diaper information. Diaper sewing is a hot pastime and many online resources, patterns, and diaper fabric stores were opened. In 2006, the bumGenius diaper by Cotton Babies was introduced, as was the Thirsties brand of diaper covers. A flushable diaper called a gDiaper was introduced in the US. In 2007, the Rumparooz pocket diaper by Kanga Care, invented by Julie Ekstrom, emerged onto the market. The Rumparooz immediately became one of the best selling cloth diapers in both the US and international markets as it was the first cloth diaper to contain double inner gussets, as invented and patented by Ekstrom. US Patent 8425483 In 2009, the GroVia Hybrid Diaper was introduced by The Natural Baby Company. A major component of this modern cloth diapering system, the BioSoaker, was awarded US patent 8115050. In 2010 Boingo Baby Diaper Fastener(Us Patent Pending) hit the market as the first innovation for diaper fasteners in 25 years. An Alternative for diaper pins it and regularly sells out due to supply and demand. In 2011 Namaste Mama was awarded a patent for their adjustable elastic one size Evolution Diaper. They were awarded a second patent in 2013 granting further coverage for the adjustable elastic design. The Evolution Diaper is now manufactured under their sister brand, Boingo Baby. 2012 saw explosion of cloth diaper \\"co-ops\\" on the website Facebook where groups of people would purchase cloth diapers in bulk from the manufacturer and distribute them to the members. In 2013, Julie Ekstrom and Kanga Care LLC were awarded US Patent 8425483, for the Double gusset cloth diaper along with method for making the same. Additional and supporting patents followed as US Pat. 8961484 (2015), US Pat. 9572726 (2017). In 2013, the Cotton Babies company was awarded a patent for their bumGenius diaper. This caused a resurgence of the \\"diaper wars\\" in 2002, with Cotton Babies pursuing Facebook co-ops, small business, and WAHM for patent violation. The Usage of Cloth Diapers gained traction in India only by the start of 2015, there are several companies like AToddlerThing, Bumpadbum and SuperBottoms selling their own Cloth Dipaers Online but the presence of Cloth diapers in general stores is still a rare sight. Cloth diaper types *Covers or wraps- Covers, also called wraps, are waterproof coverings for diapers that are not waterproof on their own. Covers must be used with all of the following diapers: **Flats – Flat diapers are a large, single layer, square or rectangle of absorbent cloth. Birdseye cotton or muslin are the most commonly used materials, but flats can also be terry cloth or flannel. Any absorbent material may be considered a \\"flat\\" if it is composed of one single layer. Flats may or may not be hemmed or otherwise finished at the edges. Flats must be folded into the desired shape before they are usable as a diaper. ** Prefolds – Prefolds are a rectangular piece of absorbent fabric that has been folded, layered, and then sewn so that the center strip of the diaper has more layers of absorbent material than the sides. This reduces bulk while still providing enough absorbency where it is needed. Prefolds get their name because before their invention, flats were the common diaper type available. Flats require folding in order to obtain the appropriate number of layers of absorbent material in the wet zone. A \\"prefold\\" is pre-folded and sewn down so that less folding is required at the time of the diaper change. Prefolds typically have 4 to 6 layers of material in the center and 2 to 4 layers on the edges. ** Shaped diapers – Shaped diapers are much like a prefold except instead of the square shape, they are a triangle, T-shaped, X-shaped, or Y-shaped. They are not commonly used today as contour diapers have generally replaced them. Even so, prefolds (the rectangle shape) remain the most popular pre-folded diaper of the three (prefolds, shaped diapers, and contours). ** Contours – Contoured diapers are much like a shaped diaper or prefold except they are cut and sewn into a general hourglass shape. This is done so that no folding is required before they are ready to be used as a diaper and also to reduce bulkiness. ** Tie-up diapers – This type of cloth diaper has to be folded, and then it is fasten together by using the strings attached to the diaper. These are not commonly used today. **Fitteds – Fitted diapers are hourglass shaped absorbent diapers that have elastic at the legs in order to better contain feces and urine. They usually also have a built in closure such as velcro or snaps that is used to secure the diaper onto the baby. There are several subtypes of fitted diapers including closureless fitteds (those that lack velcro or snaps), prefitteds (fitteds made from pre-fold diapers), and pocket fitteds (pocket diapers that use absorbent materials for all the layers instead of wicking or waterproof materials). Fitteds are popular today, particularly for use overnight when a diaper capable of holding more urine without leaking is needed. *Pocket diapers – Pocket diapers are hourglass shaped and have closures to secure them onto the baby (generally snaps or velcro). They consist of a waterproof outer layer and an inner layer that are sewn together on three sides to create a pocket. The inner layer may be made of a moisture wicking material or an absorbent material. The pocket is then stuffed with absorbent insert that can be customized based on the absorbency level required for each baby. The most common inserts are made of microfiber, bamboo or charcoal bamboo. One subtype of pocket diapers is the sleeve diaper, which is sewn only on two sides instead of three so that the pocket may be accessed from both the front and back of the diaper. * All-in-one diaper – An all in one (AIO) diaper consists of a waterproof outer layer sewn together with absorbent material on the inside. There may also be an additional inner layer of moisture-wicking material. All-in-ones are hourglass shaped and have a velcro, snap, or other closure to secure them on the baby. * All-in-two diaper – An all-in-two- diaper (AI2) is a diaper with two parts. An all-in-two diaper consists of a waterproof diaper cover with fasteners and an absorbent insert. The insert is a rectangle or hourglass pad of absorbent material, that may or may not have a moisture wicking material as its top layer. The insert snaps or lays into the cover and may be removed when soiled or wet. The cover may be reused throughout the day by replacing the insert at each change. * Hybrid diapers - A hybrid diaper is similar to an all-in-two diaper in that it is typically composed of a waterproof diaper cover and an absorbent insert. The reason for the \\"hybrid\\" name is that the same waterproof diaper cover can be used with a cloth absorbent insert OR a disposable insert. Most users use a hybrid diaper when their lifestyle includes a lot of travel, daycare, or other activities where flexibility is required. * Cloth Diaper Liners are useful in order to keep your diapers cleaner. Just lay them on top of the diaper to use. They can be made of paper or cellulose which are degradable, or polyester fleece which is washable and being non-absorbent will dry out as baby's body heat evaporates any moisture through to the diaper so it dries out and acts as a stay-dry layer in the diaper. For diaper rash, silk or silver liners have a soothing and antibacterial action.

Bush in 1990. The act mandated the assignment of a Chief Financial Officer to each major department and agency of the U.S. government. Former Comptroller General of the United States Charles Bowsher later said in testimony before the U.S. Senate that since the enactment of the bill, \\"We have seen important progress in directly confronting serious financial management weaknesses.\\" Unaccountable Congress, It Doesn't Add Up by Joseph DioGuardi, Regnery Gateway 1992 Of the 1.55 million Black American military servicemen, not one had received the Medal of Honor. DioGuardi and Democratic Congressman Mickey Leland initiated legislation to confer the honor on Black World War I and World War II military heroes who had been recommended for, but had not received, the medal. Nine Medals of Honor have since been awarded. Committee assignments DioGuardi was an active member of the executive committee of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus (CHRC) and worked with Caucus founder Tom Lantos (D-CA) on apartheid in South Africa, and on the repression of Jews in the Soviet Union and the Tibetan people and monks in China. Caucus memberships He founded and co-chaired the Congressional Long Island Sound and Hudson River Caucuses, which secured substantial increases in federal support. He co-founded with Congressman Jerrold Nadler the New York Task Force for Port, Rail and Industrial Development in order to restore lost jobs to New York's manufacturing and transportation sectors and preserve a portion of the Port of New York on the New York side of the harbor. Albanian American Civic League In the mid-1980s, Dioguardi along with a handful of Albanian-American businessmen founded the Albanian lobby, culminating in the establishment of the Albanian American Civic League (AACL) in January 1989. The lobby raised the issue of Albanian rights in Yugoslavia to the attention of U.S. policy makers in Washington. Under Dioguardi's leadership, the AACL raised millions of dollars, arranged demonstrations, testified and passed resolutions in Congress promoting the issue of Kosovo Albanians, putting pressure on U.S. administrations. Dioguardi's influence over the Albanian American lobby later diminished with the formation of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK). Some former members of the Civic League defected to the LDK, citing Dioguardi's behavior and style. According to them, Dioguardi \\"hangs onto the Civic League in order to promote his own thinly veiled political ambitions\\" and \\"demand[s] that everything go through him, even the demonstrations\\". Still, political analyst Paul Hockenos noted in 2003 that \\"Dioguardi and the Albanian lobby as a whole still pack a formidable punch, even after the dust of the wars has settled. Its sustained activity is something the other diaspora lobbies, those associated with the former Yugoslavia, no longer muster. In contrast, they are spent forces.\\" The AACL is run by Dioguardi and his second wife who also serves as \\"Balkan Affairs Adviser\\".  Post-congressional career  Non- profit organization In 1989, DioGuardi founded a non-profit organization that is known as Truth in Government. According to its website, \\"the mission of Truth in Government is to strengthen our country's financial foundation by promoting accountability and transparency in Congressional spending and reporting.\\"Truth in Government website Book In 1992, DioGuardi authored the book Unaccountable Congress: It Doesn't Add Up, published by Regnery. The book was re-released in 2010 with a new introduction that claimed to explain the chronology of events leading to the financial crisis of 2008. 2010 U.S. Senate election On March 16, 2010, DioGuardi announced at Grand Central Terminal in New York City that he was seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat held by incumbent Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Gillibrand had been appointed to the seat by Gov. Paterson after it was vacated by Hillary Clinton. DioGuardi pledged to raise over in his campaign.

He also, after the primary, secured the line of the nascent Taxpayers Party of New York when Malpass stepped aside. Prior to the election, DioGuardi was linked to a Ponzi scheme by the SEC. From 2007 to 2009, the former Westchester Republican congressman was paid a month as a consultant for the subsidiary Medical Capital Corp. – and also got a year to sit on boards of various other MCH subsidiaries. DioGuardi said he was oblivious to any wrongdoing. \\"As a consultant, Joe was tasked with saving hospitals in New York from being shut down, but knew nothing of the schemes that were occurring behind the scenes,\\" said his spokesman Brian Hummell, adding that his boss \\"has never seen the books.\\" DioGuardi lost the general election to Gillibrand, 63.0% to 35.1%.  Personal life  DioGuardi lives in Ossining, New York, with his wife, Shirley Cloyes DioGuardi. His first wife, Carol, died in 1997 of ovarian cancer.

The PDP (personal development plan), also called an IDP (individual development plan) or a PEP (personal enterprise plan), usually includes a statement of one's aspirations, strengths or competencies, education and training, and stages or steps to indicate how the plan is to be realized. Personal development plans may also include a statement of one's career and lifestyle priorities, career positioning, analysis of opportunities and risks, and alternative plans (Plan B), and a curriculum vitae (CV). In higher education, personal development plans typically include a portfolio containing evidence of the skills gathered over a particular timeframe. It is presumed in education that undertaking PDPs will assist in creating self- directed independent learners who are more likely to progress to higher levels of academic attainment. Human-resource management also uses PDPs. Personal development plans are often a requirement for employee CVs. Employees who participate in business training are often asked to complete a personal development plan.

History The first University of Oregon bookstore was organized by the Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO) in 1916 in a rented house that was on the site of the present store. After World War I, the ASUO found itself in financial difficulty and sold the bookstore to a local druggist. By 1920, it became clear that the university needed a bookstore, and a supporter from Portland, stationer J. K. Gill, set up the University of Oregon Cooperative Store. Stock in a separate corporation, the University Supply Company, was sold to department heads and faculty, including university president Prince Lucien Campbell. By 1933, the bookstore was financially solvent and the supply company was dissolved. The bookstore changed locations several times. In 1959, the Board of Directors voted to buy the College Side Inn, which was located at 13th and Kincaid streets, the site of the present bookstore.

Nicknamed the steroid guru, Duchaine gained worldwide notoriety due to his outspoken opinions on the use of performance- enhancing drugs, and made numerous television appearances discussing the subject on shows such as 20/20, Geraldo, and 60 Minutes. Steroid Nation author and ESPN writer Shaun Assael calls Duchaine \\"a founding father of the steroid movement.\\"Shaun Assael, Steroid Nation, ESPN Books, 2007  Duchaine and steroids  Duchaine began competitive bodybuilding in his home state of Maine in 1977; however, after he had no luck (describing himself as a \\"miserable bodybuilder\\"), he began using anabolic steroids that he persuaded his family physician in Portland to prescribe as a training aid.A Guru Who Spreads the Gospel of Steroids However, after beginning their use he said \\"I still wasn't very good. Obviously something wasn't working, and the doctors and the pharmacists couldn't really answer my questions. So I started looking into steroids on my own.\\" This was the start of the quest for knowledge that would eventually land him the title of \\"Guru\\" on the subject. He moved to Los Angeles in 1978. Duchaine initially claimed that he would not sell steroids because he didn't know where to get them. But after a messy divorce from his first wife left him broke, he met a supplier and began selling. He started by undercutting the local dealers, then moved into wholesale. Eventually, he became part of a major trafficking ring from Mexico, and co-founded Laboratories Milano in Tijuana, which was the largest black market steroid manufacturing plant in Mexico at the time. In mid-1987, Duchaine was caught and indicted on conspiracy and mislabeling charges. He pleaded guilty to the two counts and was sentenced to a maximum of three years in federal prison with five years of probation by Judge J. Lawrence Irving of San Diego Federal Court. In November 1988 Duchaine was profiled by The New York Times on its front page as part of an Olympics-inspired series on steroids in sports. Duchaine was released after ten months. In 1991, while still on probation he met up with a friend who was selling gamma-hydroxybutyrate (commonly known as GHB) and began working with him. One of their customers, however, was an undercover Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agent, and Duchaine was convicted a second time and sentenced to 36 months in prison. While in prison, he says he learned to make money through \\"legitimate avenues\\". In 1988, Duchaine introduced Clenbuterol to bodybuilders. Duchaine is also credited with introducing 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) into bodybuilding through an interview on one of ten cassettes included with bodybuilding magazine Muscle Media 2000. In 2007 Duchaine was featured prominently in the book Steroid Nation by ESPN writer Shaun Assael.  Writing career  First published in 1981, The Underground Steroid Handbook was an 18-page pamphlet which focused on bodybuilders who used the drugs for competition, defines the different types of steroids and explains what they look like, what they should cost, where to get them and how to use them. After placing ads in fitness and martial-arts magazines, as well as Soldier of Fortune, he printed and sold between 40,000 and 50,000 copies of the Underground Steroid Handbook at $6 a copy, over a four-year period. In 1988 Robert Voy, the chief medical officer of the United States Olympic Committee called it \\"a fabulous pharmacological text.\\" The New York Times reported that both Voy and Don Catlin of UCLA, who did most of the drug tests for the United States Olympic Committee and the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the 1980s had the book in their files. In 1992 after being released from prison for a second time Duchaine began working for Bill Phillips' Muscle Media 2000 magazine writing a monthly Q&A; column called \\"Ask the Guru\\". By this time Duchaine had published several books in his Underground Steroid Handbook series (co-authored with Michael Zumpano), and referred to himself as a Human Performance Theorist.

The neighborhood, which was the site of the city's first Italian settlement, stretches along the western edge of Youngstown's lower north side and encircles St. Anthony's Church, an Italian-American Roman Catholic parish.Trolio (2004), p. 203. Each year, at the end of August, the Brier Hill Fest attracts thousands of visitors from Northeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania.Trolio (2001), pp. 14-15.Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 184-187. Early history The area encompassing the Brier Hill neighborhood was originally owned by Youngstown industrialist George Tod, who established a farm on the district's brier-covered hills around 1801. Tod called the agricultural enterprise Brier Hill. This semi- rural area was transformed irrevocably when coal was discovered in the hills in and around Brier Hill.Blue et al. (1995), p. 37. The district drew thousands of immigrants seeking work in the mines, and Brier Hill became Youngstown's oldest working-class neighborhood.Trolio (2001), p. 11. The first iron furnace in the district was opened by the Tod family in 1847. By the 1880s, blast furnaces and rolling mills were established in close proximity to the coal mines, a practical arrangement, given that Brier Hill mines provided coal for the mills. The surrounding neighborhood grew in tandem, as more housing was built for miners, iron workers, and their families. By the opening of the 20th century, the rapid expansion of the industry in Brier Hill had turned the area into the main entry point for Youngstown's immigrants. The largest groups were Italians, Welsh, Irish, Germans, and African Americans.Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 32-33. Given its relative isolation from downtown Youngstown, Brier Hill developed independently and established its own schools as well as a post office, and churches.Trolio (2001), p. 12. During the early 20th century, the neighborhood hosted at least four churches. These included the Catholic parishes of St. Anthony's, St. Ann's, and St. Casimir's as well as the Episcopal parish of St. Rocco's. The district remained an unincorporated village (outside of Youngstown Township) until 1900, when it was absorbed by the city. Current challenges Like many urban neighborhoods, Brier Hill faces an uncertain future. Beginning in the 1950s, large swaths of the neighborhood were razed to make way for urban renewal projects, including the building of modern expressways. Brier Hill was further depopulated by economic dislocations that came with the decline, and eventual collapse, of Youngstown's steel industry. Today, all that remains of a once- vibrant ethnic enclave is the ITAM Post (Italian-American War Veterans' Club), a bandstand, Modarelli's Salumeria, and the memorial wall.Trolio (2001), pp. 13-14. The ground floor of the ITAM Post was once the site of the Forde family butcher shop, owned and operated by Italian immigrants Frank and Catherine Forde (Fiordilisi). The structure's second floor served as the Fordes' residence, where they raised eight children. A concrete marker on the building's facade features the inscription, \\"Forde 1921\\". Other Italian enclaves Although many districts and communities in the Youngstown area had large Italian-American populations--including Smoky Hollow, the near East Side, East Youngstown (now Campbell), Struthers, and Lowellville--Brier Hill was widely recognized as the city's unofficial Little Italy. Pizza The neighborhood was the birthplace of \\"Brier Hill pizza\\", a home-style recipe with origins in the Basilicata region of Italy. Brier Hill pizza is prepared with a generous amount of thick \\"Sunday sauce\\", bell peppers and romano cheese, as opposed to the more typical mozzarella. It is one of several dishes the Youngstown area prides itself upon, in much the same way New Yorkers value their distinctive thin-crusted New York-style pizza.Trolio (2001), pp. 105-108. Neighborhood progress Local activists from the Pro-Yo Party and the ITAM (Post 12) are working to make Brier Hill a Sister-City/\\"Cugin\\" Community of San Pietro Avellana (Isernia). San Pietro is a small village in the Apennine hills of Southeastern Italy that is the ancestral home of many Italian Americans in the Youngstown area.

It was one of the largest air defense radars ever produced, with its antenna and supporting structure mounted on one of the largest rolling-element bearings in the world (with a ball pitch of 12 ft 7 inches in diameter.).Blatter, Francis P. Mechanical Considerations in Antenna Design, Sperry Engineering Review, p. 55, 58. Sperry Corporation built 12 long range radars (picking up objects 200 miles away) in the 1960s to succeed existing Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) to provide enhanced electronic countermeasures (ECM). The systems operated at 420 to 450 MHz. The antennas weighed and had numerous problems. The concrete tower bases were high and square in side dimensions. The prototype was developed at the Thomasville Aircraft Control and Warning Station in Thomasville, Alabama. All of the radars have been dismantled except for the one at Camp Hero on the eastern tip of Long Island, New York. Fishermen on the Atlantic Ocean and Block Island Sound lobbied to save it since the massive radar tower was a better daytime landmark than the Montauk Point Lighthouse. The radar complex is now part of Camp Hero State Park which adjoins Montauk Point State Park. The radar has worked its way into an urban legend that it was used in time travel experiments called the Montauk Project. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Note: This includes and The enclosed radar towers that supported all 12 of the FPS-35 antennas were prominent landmarks. All these radar towers were of the same basic design with 10 made primarily from concrete and two based on a steel frame structure (Baker and Finley). Only the radar tower at Baker has been demolished. The AN/FPS-35 at Montauk was the last to operate (Jan 1981) and the radar tower is the only one that still has an antenna on the roof and contains some of the radar set equipment and cabinets. The antenna was repaired with parts from Sault Ste. Marie after this station closed in Oct 1979. Presently The Montauk antenna is very corroded and can not be rotated. The 23 radar towers used by the AN/FPS-24 and the AN/FPS-35 radar sets were of similar designs (concrete or steel frame) and were designed under the direction of the Rome Air Development Center (RADC). The radar tower at Thomasville has an RADC plaque next to the one from the Sperry Corporation. Only the AN/FPS-35 tower at Baker included a radome to protect the antenna.

Koch designed it by directly carving the type into metal. The original typeface thus had a great deal of variance between the sizes, something not followed in digital versions where the same font serves for every print size. While originally intended as a form of modern blackletter, Neuland has come instead to be used as a signifier of the “exotic” or “primitive”, such as in the logos for Trader Vic's, Natural American Spirit cigarettes, promotional materials for The Lion King, and the Jurassic Park films (which use the inline variant); controversially, this has included an association with African or African-American themes. Sample of Neuland Inline A common variant of Neuland (perhaps more common than the standard variety) is Neuland Inline. Monotype licensed the design under the name of 'Othello' (released 1928) with the agreement that it would not be sold in Germany, Austria or Switzerland.

By June 2017, the catalog consisted of books from 284 library facilities in 143 counties across the U.S. state of Georgia with a collection size of 10.6 million items, all of which are searchable by anyone with a PINES library card which can be obtained free of charge from any PINES-participating library. The PINES system effectively turns most of the state of Georgia into one huge library. PINES cardholders are able to request an interlibrary loan from any affiliated library, and the single statewide library card grants access to the hundreds of branches associated with the service. PINES also manages the booking of rooms, the use of remote self-check machines, allows automated search and retrieval, as well as supports RSS and Schema.org standards. PINES developed the open-source software Evergreen, an integrated library system which it and other library consortia use to manage their online catalogs. History PINES Development In 1998 a white paper was created exploring the feasibility of a statewide public library card for Georgia. As Georgia had consistently ranked among the lowest states in public library funding per capita it was agreed that a universal library card could be of great benefit to the residents of Georgia as long as the affiliated libraries were unified under one single integrated library system (ILS). It was also believed that by establishing a state-wide library cost to individual library systems would be lowered as they wouldn't need to maintain their own integrated library systems, and certain tasks could be centralized through the state saving additional time. By 1999 PINES became a reality, administered by the current Georgia Public Library Service (GPLS). It initially was used as a Y2K state-funded project to address needs of public libraries without Y2K-compliant ILS computer services. These libraries, mostly rural, were deemed not to have programs that would survive into the 21st century. Some libraries were still not automated as well. The PINES initiative would give these libraries access first, bringing their services into the modern era. Looking to complete the project before the year 2000, on April 8, 1999 the initial contract to develop the ILS was awarded to KPMG Consulting Inc partnered with the SIRSI Corporation and Sun Microsystems. In December 1999 the new software was finished and ready for deployment. In that same month Phase 1 of PINES went live with 98 affiliated libraries. For the next two years other libraries saw the success of PINES, and rather than replace their outdated ILS with a new independent one, requested to join the statewide system. In 2001 Phase 2 of PINES went live with an addition 111 libraries joining the service. Evergreen Development In 2004 the GPLS decided not to renew their contract with KPMG/Sirsi after being advised that under the current software no more libraries would be able to be added to the system. As a result the GPLS explored the possibility of creating their own software, and on June 4, 2004 a press release by the state librarian outlined a two-year development plan for a new PINES ILS software called Evergreen. The new ILS was completed and ready to go live in September 2006. On September 1, the Sirsi ILS was taken offline, and by September 5 Evergreen was up and running. Due to the success of Evergreen it was awarded the Mellon Award for Technology Collaboration in 2007 by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Since its initial release, Evergreen is now used in over 1,800 libraries around the world, including the highest-circulating library in the United States, the King County Library System.

There have, however, been a number of unsuccessful attempts to amend the Constitution in accordance with its amending formula. Property Rights Amendment, 1983 On April 18, 1983, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau expressed support for entrenching property rights in the Constitution, but only if debate were limited to a single day. The debate became engulfed in partisan tactics and eleven days later the Progressive Conservative Opposition introduced a motion of non-confidence in the House of Commons of Canada that sought to entrench the right to the \\"enjoyment of property\\" in the Constitution. Trudeau's government was not prepared to support its own defeat by backing such a motion. In any case, its passing would dissolve the House and prevent the Senate from considering the proposed amendment. On May 2, 1983, the motion was defeated, with 88 votes in favour and 126 opposed.http://dsp- psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp268-e.htm Powers of the Senate Amendment, 1984 In 1984, following the election of a Progressive Conservative majority in the House of Commons and the appointment of Brian Mulroney as Prime Minister, the Senate of Canada came under increased scrutiny. Under the Constitution of Canada, senators are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister, and during his time in office Mulroney's predecessor, Pierre Trudeau, had arranged the appointment of a large number of Senators, giving the Liberals a majority in the upper house. There was a fear that the Senate would block Mulroney's legislation, so an attempt to amend the Constitution was made to limit the powers of the Senate. Under the proposed amendment the Senate would have a suspensive veto of 30 days on money bills and 45 days on all other bills. The proposed amendment secured the support of the majority of the provincial governments, though it was opposed by Quebec and Manitoba. The amendment was introduced into the House of Commons on June 7, 1985, but 19 days later the government of Ontario changed hands, and the new Liberal Premier, David Peterson, refused to support the amendment. Without Ontario's support the amendment could not meet the requirement for support from provinces containing more than 50 percent of the population, so the amendment died. Rights of the Unborn Amendment, 1986–1987 A private member's motion calling for an amendment that would enshrine rights for fetuses in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and thus limit the legality of abortion, was introduced in the House of Commons on November 21, 1986 by Gus Mitges, the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Grey—Simcoe. The motion called on the government to consider the advisability of amending Section 7 of the Charter to include a reference to human fetuses and the unborn, and called on the Governor General to issue a proclamation amending Section 7. The passing of the motion would not have resulted in an amendment to Section 7, as the Constitution's amending formula requires the approval of the House of Commons, the Senate and two-thirds or more of the provincial legislative assemblies representing at least 50 percent of the national population. The debate and vote on the motion occurred on June 2, 1987. Doug Lewis, as Parliamentary secretary to Erik Nielsen (the then Deputy Prime Minister and President of the Privy Council), spoke on behalf of the government, stating that the motion was not \\"the proper way\\" to initiate a constitutional amendment, and that the government felt it \\"inappropriate\\" to amend laws dealing with therapeutic abortions at that time. Lewis did add that the debate on the motion provided \\"an important airing of views\\". After a number of other members spoke on both sides of the issue, the motion failed on a vote of 62 to 89. Meech Lake Accord, 1987–1990 The Meech Lake Accord was a complex package of proposed amendments designed to address a number of concerns about the Canadian Constitution. Among other things, it proposed granting Quebec \\"distinct status\\" within the Canadian federation, and changing the amending formula of the Constitution by requiring unanimous consent of all the provinces for a greater number of amendments. The accord ultimately failed when the Manitoba legislature and the government of Newfoundland refused to assent to it. Charlottetown Accord, 1990–1992 Like the Meech Lake Accord, the Charlottetown Accord was a package of proposed amendments designed to address a number of concerns about the Constitution, many of which were similar to those included in Meech Lake. It was unanimously decided that a national referendum would be held on the Charlottetown Accord, but the referendum failed. Preamble to the Charter, 1999 In 1999, New Democratic Party MP for Burnaby-Douglas, Svend Robinson, proposed in the House of Commons that the reference to God be struck from the preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, citing concerns about Canada's diversity and those Canadians who did not believe in God. Robinson was supported by a thousand constituents who had signed a petition, but the proposal was controversial and the party responded by undermining Robinson's responsibilities and his position in the caucus. The proposal went no further.

After several days of shelling and bombardment, Nationalists stormed the fortified border city of Badajoz on August 14, 1936, cutting off the Spanish Republic from neighbouring Portugal and linking the northern and southern zones of Nationalist control (although actual contact with General Emilio Mola's northern troops was not established until September 8). Strategic situation Republican (red) and Nationalist (blue) controlled areas, September 1936. Green areas represent the Nationalist territorial gains since the beginning of the war. The Spanish Civil War had begun on July 19, 1936, after a half-failed coup d'état: the rebels had not managed to take power, but the Republic could not crush them either. This left rebel forces in control of only approximately a third of the country. José Sanjurjo died in a plane crash the 20th. Emilio Mola had control of the North, while Francisco Franco took care of the Morrocan part. His first move had been to get German and Italian air support to transport almost 10,000 regular troops of the Spanish Army of Africa to southern Spain across the Straits of Gibraltar.Jackson, Gabriel. La república española y la guerra civil. 2005. RBA. Barcelona. Pag. 227 German and Italian planes, painted as Spanish, airlifted most of them, and ensured that the Republican Navy did not cross the way of the Nationalist fleet transporting the remaining and the heaviest gear. By August 1, General Franco was able to order a sweep north to link up his forces assembled at Seville with General Mola's distant forces. Led in the field by Colonel Carlos Asensio and Major Antonio Castejón, the Nationalist Army dashed north in motorized detachments, pausing to bombard and capture walled frontier towns. By August 10, when Lieutenant Colonel Juan Yagüe arrived to take command near Mérida, the Nationalists had secured 300 km of the Portuguese frontier. Mérida fell after a stiff fight on the banks of the Guadiana River, leaving the neighbouring city of Badajoz, now the last remaining Republican outpost on the Portuguese border, isolated from the Republic. Franco personally supervised the operation against Mérida and on the evening of August 10, received Yagüe in his headquarters to discuss the capture of Badajoz and the next objectives. He wanted to knock out the city to unify the two sections of the rebel zone and leave the left flank of the advancing columns covered by the Portuguese border. Preston (2012). p. 314. Tactical situation Yagüe marched against Badajoz with 2,250 soldiers of the Spanish Foreign Legion, 750 Moroccan regulares, and five field batteries (total 30 guns), leaving Major Heli Tella behind to hold Mérida. Inside the ancient fortress-city, large sections of whose walls had been demolished some years before the war,ESPINOSA, Francisco. La columna de la muerte. El avance del ejército franquista de Sevilla a Badajoz. 2003. Editorial Crítica. Barcelona. p. 63. The border with Portugal was on the west side of the city. Rebels were coming from the East. The city had been flooded with refugees and the atmosphere in the city was one of doom-laden anticipation.NEVES, Mario. La matanza de Badajoz. Junta de Extremadura. 2007 Mérida. pp. 47-63 The Nationalists had been successful since the beginning of their advance. Moreover, on August 6, when the Nationalist army approached, a body of Guardia Civil had attempted to defect to the rebels.Espinosa, Francisco. La justicia de Queipo. Editorial Crítica. Barcelona. 2006. p. 134 Colonel Ildefonso Puigdendolas, the leader in charge of the Republican force of about 2,000 - 4,000 or 6,000 militia (depending on the sources), had crushed the revolt, but it had taken its toll of men and morale. The battle Before the attack, Badajoz was continuously bombarded by Nationalist artillery and bombers for three days. The rebels, coming from the East, launched their attack on the morning of August 14, after shelling the town again. Colonel Puigdendolas, along with the Mayor and other members of the defence committee, slipped out of the city at about 9:00 am and fled to Portugal.Espinosa, Francisco. La columna de la muerte. El avance del ejército franquista de Sevilla a Badajoz. 2003. Editorial Crítica. Barcelona. p.88-89 On the south side of the city, Nationalist units stormed the walls easily. The Moroccan Tetuán regulares pushed through the Puerta de Los Carros (Car Gate), and the Legionnaires and Moroccans swept the Republicans from the barracks. Meanwhile, many soldiers inside the city defected to the rebels, easily allowing the entrance of the attackers into the city.Espinosa, Francisco. La columna de la muerte. El avance del ejército franquista de Sevilla a Badajoz. 2003. Editorial Crítica. Barcelona. pag.90 The only place where the attack encountered difficulties was around Puerta de la Trinidad (Trinity Gate). The defenders' most reliable force, the Carabineros, had been placed there in anticipation of the action. Determined resistance by Republican machine gunners and riflemen checked the assault, shredding several waves of IV Bandera of the Spanish Foreign Legion. Ignoring their losses, the Legionnaires pressed on. A charge led by armoured cars won the gate, and the Nationalists overtook the defenders, pouring through the breach and killing them in hand-to-hand combat. But, the cost was appalling: the attacking 16th Company had lost 76 out of 90 officers and menJulián Chaves Palacios, La Guerra Civil en Extremadura: Operaciones Militares (other sources cite 20 dead, 22 wounded and 2 missing).Espinosa, Francisco. La columna de la muerte. El avance del ejército franquista de Sevilla a Badajoz. 2003. Editorial Crítica. Barcelona. p.103. All of the unit's officers fell in the attack excepting the captain and one corporal (other sources: two officers dead out of five).Neves, Mario. La matanza de Badajoz. Junta de Extremadura. 2007. Mérida. p.88. Meanwhile, Asensio's men had entered in the city by a breach in the city walls; the storming of the Puerta de la Trinidad was later seen as useless.Espinosa, Francisco. La columna de la muerte. El avance del ejército franquista de Sevilla a Badajoz. 2003. Editorial Crítica. Barcelona. p.93 Once inside the ramparts the military drove the Republican militia before them, knifing and bayoneting their way toward the city centre, including killing those who had thrown down their weapons and had their hands up. Street fighting raged past nightfall. The Legionnaires later captured 43 wounded milicianos in the military hospital, and afterward, killed them.Espinosa, Francisco. La columna de la muerte. El avance del ejército franquista de Sevilla a Badajoz. 2003. Editorial Crítica. Barcelona. p.91 Aftermath The battle contributed several days to the delay which allowed the government to organize its defenses around Madrid. The fall of Badajoz tore from the Republic the large region of Extremadura, north of Huelva, which was later subdued and swallowed up by the emerging Nationalist state. After the battle, Yagüe turned northeastward toward Madrid and the Tagus River. During his trek, he engaged Republican forces in pitched battles in the weeks that followed. The Battle of Badajoz followed patterns that continued throughout much of the summer: Republican militia seized the medieval fortresses dotting Castile, yet could not halt nor even slow down the advance of Franco's professional and better equipped troops. The Spanish regular army would prove able to sweep prepared defences held by superior enemy forces, but often suffered heavy losses of its best troops. By year's end, many of the Spanish Foreign Legion lay dead, scattered along a trail of walled towns stretching from Seville to the outskirts of Madrid. Massacre of civilians It has been widely reported that the Nationalists sacked BadajozCasanova, Julían; Espinosa, Francisco; Mir, Conxita; Moreno Gómez, Francisco. Morir, matar, sobrevivir. La violencia en la dictadura de Franco. Editorial Crítica. Barcelona. 2002. pp.73-74 and killed thousands of prisoners and civilians, culminating in an infamous round of executions in the town's bull ring, where machine-guns were set up on the barriers around the ring. The screams of the dying could be heard many streets away. Murder and mass rape flared unchecked for several days, and Yagüe's failure to call a halt to the killings earned him the nickname, \\"The Butcher of Badajoz\\".Rafael Tenorio, Las matanzas de Badajoz (Spanish) Foreign correspondents, depending on their political sympathies, reported between an estimated 1,800Thomas, Hugh.

Victimas de la guerra civil. Ediciones Temas de Hoy. Madrid. 1999. p. 77. because he did not want to leave enemies, either soldiers or civilians, to the rear of his army. In fact, Yagüe was quoted to have said the following to one Jay T. Whitaker: \\"Of course we shot them - he said to me - what do you expect? Was I supposed to take 4,000 reds with me as my column advanced, racing against time? Was I expected to turn them loose in my rear and let them make Badajoz red again?\\"De Madariaga, MºRosa.

The massacre at Badajoz was not a unique case in the march of Yagüe's column from Seville to Badajoz. In every city conquered by Yagüe's men, many civilians were killed.Espinosa, Francisco.

In addition to scheduled passenger operations, the airport is the base of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Tokushima Air Training Group of 202nd Naval Air Training Squadron equipped with Beechcraft TC-90. There are also UH-60J Search and Rescue aircraft of one flight which detached from JMSDF 72 Squadron. As a result, it is the busiest airport in Shikoku by aircraft operations, with around 15,000 takeoffs and landings each year. The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force established the 14 Squadron flying at least two Fuji UH-1J and one Kawasaki OH-6D by mid-April 2010 at the airport. History Aerial view of Tokushima Airport Tokushima Airport opened as an Imperial Japanese Navy air base in 1941. The current runway was completed in 1987; it was extended to , with projected completion in 2010.http://airportnews.jp/headline/8/ The airport has had scheduled service to Kagoshima (1997–98), Kansai (briefly in 2000), and Osaka/Itami (until 2003). There are 12 scheduled flights per day. On April 13, 2006, Skymark Airlines discontinued its flights to Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) leaving Japan Airlines as the sole carrier to Tokyo. In response to Skymark's exit, Japan Airlines increased the number of flights between the two cities. Since Tokyo-Haneda opened its fourth runway, All Nippon Airways announced the resumption of service to Tokyo. A new passenger terminal opened in the first quarter of 2010. An international terminal facility with a dedicated boarding bridge and waiting area opened in January 2018, mainly to accommodate charter flights from China. ShinMaywa Industries, Ltd. maintains a plant (primarily aircraft modification and refurbishment) at the airport. The plant also provides components for the Gulfstream G550 [GV-SP] and Kawasaki P-1.

ME or βME, as it is commonly abbreviated, is used to reduce disulfide bonds and can act as a biological antioxidant by scavenging hydroxyl radicals (amongst others). It is widely used because the hydroxyl group confers solubility in water and lowers the volatility. Due to its diminished vapor pressure, its odor, while unpleasant, is less objectionable than related thiols. Production 2-Mercaptoethanol is manufactured industrially by the reaction of ethylene oxide with hydrogen sulfide. Thiodiglycol and various zeolites catalyze the reaction. :Reaction of ethylene oxide with hydrogen sulfide to form 2-mercaptoethanol in the presence of thiodiglycol as solvent and catalyst. Reactions 2-Mercaptoethanol reacts with aldehydes and ketones to give the corresponding oxathiolanes. This makes 2-mercaptoethanol useful as a protecting group, giving a derivative whose stability is between that of a dioxolane and a dithiolane. :Reaction scheme for the formation of oxathiolanes by reaction of 2-mercaptoethanol with aldehydes or ketones. Applications Reducing proteins Some proteins can be denatured by 2-mercaptoethanol, which cleaves the disulfide bonds that may form between thiol groups of cysteine residues. In the case of excess 2-mercaptoethanol, the following equilibrium is shifted to the right: : RS–SR + 2 HOCH2CH2SH 2 RSH + HOCH2CH2S–SCH2CH2OH :Reaction scheme for the cleavage of disulfide bonds by 2-mercaptoethanol By breaking the S-S bonds, both the tertiary structure and the quaternary structure of some proteins can be disrupted. Because of its ability to disrupt the structure of proteins, it was used in the analysis of proteins, for instance, to ensure that a protein solution contains monomeric protein molecules, instead of disulfide linked dimers or higher order oligomers. However, since 2-mercaptoethanol forms adducts with free cysteines and is somewhat more toxic, dithiothreitol (DTT) is generally more used especially in SDS-PAGE. DTT is also a more powerful reducing agent with a redox potential (at pH 7) of −0.33 V, compared to −0.26 V for 2-mercaptoethanol. 2-Mercaptoethanol is often used interchangeably with dithiothreitol (DTT) or the odorless tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) in biological applications. Although 2-mercaptoethanol has a higher volatility than DTT, it is more stable: 2-mercaptoethanol's half-life is more than 100 hours at pH 6.5 and 4 hours at pH 8.5; DTT's half-life is 40 hours at pH 6.5 and 1.5 hours at pH 8.5.Yeh, J. I. (2009) \\"Additives and microcalorimetric approaches for optimization of crystallization\\" in Protein Crystallization, 2nd Edition (Ed: T. Bergfors), International University Line, La Jolla, CA. . Preventing protein oxidation 2-Mercaptoethanol and related reducing agents (e.g., DTT) are often included in enzymatic reactions to inhibit the oxidation of free sulfhydryl residues, and hence maintain protein activity. It is often used in enzyme assays as a standard buffer component. Denaturing ribonucleases 2-Mercaptoethanol is used in some RNA isolation procedures to eliminate ribonuclease released during cell lysis. Numerous disulfide bonds make ribonucleases very stable enzymes, so 2-mercaptoethanol is used to reduce these disulfide bonds and irreversibly denature the proteins. This prevents them from digesting the RNA during its extraction procedure. Safety 2-Mercaptoethanol is considered toxic, causing irritation to the nasal passageways and respiratory tract upon inhalation, irritation to the skin, vomiting and stomach pain through ingestion, and potentially death if severe exposure occurs.

It was initially a working-class neighborhood, but has experienced rapid gentrification since the 1990s. Now it boasts similar demographics to its neighboring Potrero Hill – an upper middle- class working professional neighborhood. Dogpatch was originally part of Potrero Nuevo and its history is closely tied to Potrero Hill. Dogpatch has its own neighborhood association but shares a merchant association, Democratic caucuses, and general neighborhood matters with Potrero Hill. Location Dogpatch neighborhood in 1937 Dogpatch is located on the eastern side of the city, adjacent to the waterfront of the San Francisco Bay, and to the east of Potrero Hill. Its boundaries are Mariposa Street to the north, I-280 to the west, Cesar Chavez to the south, and the waterfront to the east. It contains housing, some remaining heavy industry, more recent light industry, and a new but growing arts district. In 2002 it became an officially designated historic district of the city of San Francisco. Dogpatch, San Francisco Attractions and characteristics Dogpatch is mostly flatland and has many docks (most of them built atop landfill). It is an industrialized area with pockets of residences. Many warehouses were converted to lofts and condos in recent years. Like its neighbor Potrero Hill, Dogpatch enjoys sunny weather in San Francisco. Its Caltrain station at 22nd Street makes Dogpatch popular with commuters who work south of San Francisco. 22nd Street is one of only nine stations in Caltrain’s 29-station system that receive \\"Baby Bullet\\" express service in addition to regular service. The main commercial artery of Dogpatch is Third Street, which contains retail and service businesses and is served by the T Third Street light rail line operated by the San Francisco Municipal Railway. The Third Street corridor connects Dogpatch to San Francisco's downtown, via new development zones including Mission Bay and the UCSF research campus. Notable sites in the neighborhood include Irving M. Scott School, the oldest public school building in San Francisco, built 1895; the historic shipyards at Pier 70; a boxing gym, where many local amateurs train; a number of restaurants & breweries; Esprit Park, a sunny lawn with bordering trees that was donated to the city by Esprit Corp.; the headquarters of the San Francisco chapter of Hells Angels; and numerous historical residences. Unique to San Francisco, property owners in Dogpatch and Northwest Potrero Hill established the first Green Benefit District (GBD), a way for San Francisco residents to directly invest in the beautification and greening of their neighborhood. Name origin The name \\"Dogpatch\\" was first used for this area of San Francisco before World War II. There is no definitive explanation for the name; popular hypotheses are: *It was called \\"Dutchman's Flat, where Dutchmen from the old country lived\\". ** Billy Carr, sheriff's deputy, raised in Irish Hill, 1946 *It was named after Dogpatch, the fictional middle-of-nowhere setting of cartoonist Al Capp's classic comic strip, Li'l Abner (1934–1977). A colloquialism of the time which described an underdeveloped backwater, Dogpatch was a primitive community \\"nestled in a bleak valley, between two cheap and uninteresting hills somewhere.\\" * It is named after the dogfennel that proliferates there. * There were packs of dogs that used to scavenge discarded meat parts from Butchertown (a slaughterhouse district located in Bayview) along Islais Creek and up the bay. History Because it survived the 1906 earthquake and fire relatively undamaged, and until recently had not been redeveloped, Dogpatch has some of the oldest houses in San Francisco, dating from the 1860s. Between the 1860s and 1880s, the marshes at the edge of the bay were filled, and the area was connected to the main part of the city by bridges across what was then Mission Bay (which has since been filled in). Located nearby was the now-defunct working-class neighborhood of Irish Hill. This proximity allowed for development of industry and housing. Waterfront-oriented industry, including shipbuilding, drydocks and ship outfitting and repairs, warehouses, steel mills, and similar industries flourished until after World War II, when they began to decline. Dogpatch endured several decades of decline, which lasted until the 1990s, when economic pressures led to modest gentrification of the existing housing stock, and new construction including loft-style condominiums, many of which were designated as \\"live-work\\" units for artists, graphic designers, and similar occupations. The conversion of existing industrial space to live-work units or other housing has been controversial. Summary The history of Dogpatch and Potrero Hill are closely tied as both were once part of Potrero Nuevo and belonged to the same land owner (Francisco de Haro). Industry first arrived at Dogpatch in the mid-1850s. The earliest residents were mostly European immigrant factory workers. Over time, Dogpatch became more industrialized and many residents migrated to neighboring Potrero Hill. It remained blue-collared and working-class until the mid-1990s when gentrification vastly changed the neighborhood. Early history Dogpatch was uninhabited land for much of its history, used sporadically by Native Americans as hunting ground. In the late 1700s, Spanish missionaries grazed cattle on the hill and named this area (Dogpatch and Potrero Hill) Potrero Nuevo. \\"Potrero\\" is Spanish for \\"pasture\\"; \\"Potrero Nuevo\\" means \\"new pasture.\\" Rancho Potrero de San Francisco Mexico gained independence from the colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain in 1821. In 1844 the Mexican Alta California Governor Juan Alvarado granted Rancho Potrero de San Francisco to Francisco and Ramon de Haro, the 17-year-old twin sons of Don Francisco de Haro, who was then alcalde (mayor) of Yerba Buena (present day San Francisco). Just two years later, Francisco and Ramon de Haro were shot dead by Kit Carson along with their uncle, José de los Reyes Berreyesa, in Sonoma at the order of U.S. Army Major John C. Fremont, who had declared war on Mexico. Fremont's men were called the Osos, the local insurgents of the day. These Osos jailed the Sonoma alcalde and put the town under siege in the Bear Flag Revolt. The Haro twins and De los Reyes Berreyesa traveled to Sonoma to inquire on the safety of the latter's sons when they were discovered and killed. With the death of his sons, Don Francisco de Haro became owner of Rancho Rincon de las Salinas y Potrero Viejo.Sfgate.com article, June 2006. Construction of street grids in the Gold Rush era In 1848, after the conclusion of the Mexican–American War, Mexico ceded all of California, and it was admitted into the Union in 1850. Dr. John Townsend became the second mayor of the town now called San Francisco (changed from Yerba Buena in 1847). He succeeded de Haro, who was distraught over the death of his twin sons. Townsend would have a profound impact on the development of Potrero Hill. With the start of the Gold Rush era in 1848, San Francisco experienced unprecedented rapid growth. Townsend envisioned developing Potrero Hill as a community for migrants and their newfound riches. Townsend, a good friend of de Haro, approached him about dividing his land into individual lots and selling them. De Haro, with his land rights already challenged and fearing that the United States government would now strip him of Potrero Nuevo, agreed to Townsend's suggestion. Together with famed surveyor Jasper O'Farrell, recent emigrant Cornelius De Boom, and Captain John Sutter, they hashed out the grid and street names. Even before California became a state, local residents saw Potrero Nuevo as an intersection of Mexican California and the United States, due to its location. Townsend capitalized on this sentiment by naming the north-south streets after American states (Arkansas, Utah, Kansas, etc.) and the east-west streets after California counties (Mariposa, Alameda, Butte, Santa Clara, etc.). At this time, Potrero Hill was not part of San Francisco, so the men marketed this area as \\"South San Francisco.\\" Historians speculate that \\"merging the United States with the counties of California would attract homesick easterners\\" and their newly acquired gold-rush riches to settle in the neighborhood. There is also speculation that Townsend named the north-south streets after states which he had been to, with Pennsylvania Street (his home state) being an extra wide street. However, there is no record of Townsend ever having been to Texas or Florida, whose names appear as streets. The east-west county street names survived until 1895, but as the city expanded, the Post Office demanded a simplification of the street grids. Most of the county streets took the names of the numbered streets that connected them to downtown, but because they didn't all line up exactly, a few county streets survived (such as Mariposa and Alameda). By the standard of the mid-nineteenth century, Potrero Hill was not a convenient location to get to - it was still separated by Mission Bay, which was not yet filled in. Prospective buyers partly deemed Potrero Hill too far away and were wary of De Haro's uncertainty as legal owner of the land. As a result, only a few lots were sold. In late 1849, Don Francisco de Haro died, and he was buried in Mission Dolores. Industry After the death of de Haro, squatters began to overtake Potrero Point. The de Haro family tried to maintain control of the land but the family's ownership was challenged legally. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court when in 1866 it ruled against the De Haro family. Residents of Potrero Point celebrated with bonfires after learning of the outcome, some of whom gained title to the lot where they squatted through the Squatter's Rights. Development eventually came in the early 1850s, not in the form of rich gold-miners envisioned by Townsend, but in a more blue-collar variety. PG&E; opened a plant in Potrero Point in 1852. Not long after, a gunpowder factory (gunpowder is vital for gold mining) opened nearby; shipyards, iron factories, and warehouses followed. Potrero Point experienced a minor boom in housing as factory workers preferred to live nearby. The opening of the Long Bridge in the 1860s would drastically change the dynamics of Dogpatch and Potrero Hill. The Long Bridge In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed into law the Pacific Railway Act that provided Federal government support for the building of the First transcontinental railroad. In anticipation of the railroad, San Francisco began work in 1865 to build the Long Bridge, to connect San Francisco proper through Mission Bay to Potrero Hill, Dogpatch and Bayview. Dogpatch, once deemed too far south, was suddenly a stone's throw away. The Long Bridge completely transformed Potrero Nuevo from no man's land to a central hub. One of the first of many waves of real estate speculation on Potrero Hill soon followed. The Long Bridge was closed after Mission Bay was filled in the early 1900s, which made Dogpatch an even more desirable location. European migration 1918, Looking north. By the early 1900s, a large concentration of non-English European immigrants had settled. The two earliest residential neighborhoods were the Irish Hill and Dutchman's Flat. The infamous Irish Hill, located east of Illinois St and right next to the factories, housed mainly Irish factory workers in boarding houses. Irish gangs were formed and crimes were rampant. Irish Hill was leveled for use as landfill and the residents displaced in 1918. Over half of Dogpatch's population at this time was Irish immigrants; Scots, Swiss, Russians, Slovenians, Serbians and Italians made up part of the population, and native born whites accounted for less than 20%. Freeway and development By the 1930s, the land in Dogpatch had already been built out. The advance of automobile affordability meant that many factory workers were able to drive to work and live further away from the factories in Dogpatch, and thus there was no urgency to increase housing in Dogpatch to accommodate more people. The neighborhood didn't see significant housing development until the 1980s. As a result, many late nineteenth and early twentieth century residences are preserved to this day. The United States' decision to enter World War II created an industrial boom in Dogpatch, led by the shipyards that constructed navy ships. Dogpatch experienced a significant increase in population (but not housing). In the 1960s, Interstate 280 was constructed, under much controversy. To obtain the necessary land for the freeways, some residents were forced to vacate their homes in exchange for significantly below-market price paid by the government. Interstate 280 sliced through Potrero Nuevo, and the area east of the freeway began to form a unique identity. More people began to refer to this neighborhood as \\"Dogpatch.\\" Modern era Dogpatch began to shed its gritty, working-class roots during the dot-com era in the 1990s, when its demographic began to change due to spillover from Potrero Hill and the Mission District. The transformation of Mission Bay (to the north of Dogpatch) into a biotechnology and healthcare hub further gentrified Dogpatch.

Arabic coffee is typically grown at a height of 1000 to 2000 meters, and represents about 60-70% of the coffee industry in the world. Most Arab countries throughout the Middle East have developed unique methods for brewing and preparing coffee. Cardamom is an often-added spice, but it can alternatively be served plain . There are several different styles to brewing the coffee depending on the preference of the drinker. Some methods keep the coffee light, which usually contains cardamom, whereas others can make it dark. Arabic coffee is bitter, and typically no sugar is added. It is usually served in a small cup that is adorned with a decorative pattern, known as a finjān. Culturally, Arabic coffee is served during family gatherings or when receiving guests. Arabic coffee is ingrained within Middle Eastern and Arab culture and tradition, and is the most popular form of coffee brewed in the Middle East. It originated in the Middle East, beginning in Yemen and eventually travelling to Mecca (Hejaz), Egypt, the Levant, and then, in the mid-16th century, to Turkey and from there to Europe where Coffee eventually became popular as well. Arabic coffee is an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Arab states confirmed by UNESCO.  Etymology  Arab woman (coffee bearer) by John Frederick Lewis (1857). in Cairo, Egypt) The word \\"coffee\\" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie,OED, s.v. \\"Coffee\\". borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve, in turn borrowed from the Arabic قَهْوَة (qahwa, “coffee, a brew”).Oxford English Dictionary, 1st ed. \\"coffee, n.\\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1891. The word qahwah may have originally referred to the drink's reputation as an appetite suppressant from the word qahiya ().(see also qahiya: Hans Wehr's Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic. page 930.) The name qahwah is not used for the berry or plant (the products of the region), which are known in Arabic as bunn. Semitic had a root qhh \\"dark color\\", which became a natural designation for the beverage. According to this analysis, the feminine form qahwah (also meaning \\"dark in color, dull(ing), dry, sour\\") also had the meaning of wine, which was also often dark in color.  History  The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century, in Yemen's Sufi monasteries. Sufis used it to keep themselves alert during their nighttime devotions. A translation of Al-Jaziri's manuscriptAl-Jaziri's manuscript work is of considerable interest with regards to the history of coffee in Europe as well. A copy reached the French royal library, where it was translated in part by Antoine Galland as De l'origine et du progrès du café. traces the spread of coffee from Arabia Felix (the present day Yemen) northward to Mecca and Medina, and then to the larger cities of Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad, and Constantinople. In 1511, it was forbidden for its stimulating effect by conservative, orthodox imams at a theological court in Mecca. However, these bans were to be overturned in 1524 by an order of the Ottoman Turkish Sultan Suleiman I, with Grand Mufti Mehmet Ebussuud el-İmadi issuing a fatwa allowing the consumption of coffee. In Cairo, Egypt, a similar ban was instituted in 1532, and the coffeehouses and warehouses containing coffee beans were sacked.  Preparation  Dallahs Arabic coffee is made from coffee beans roasted very lightly or heavily from and cardamom, and is a traditional beverage in Arab culture. Traditionally, it is roasted on the premises (at home or for special occasions), ground, brewed and served in front of guests. It is often served with dates, dried fruit, candied fruit or nuts. Arabic coffee is defined by the method of preparation and flavors, rather than the type of roast beans. Arabic coffee is boiled coffee that is not filtered, made black. Sugar is not typically added, but if so, it can be added during preparation or when serving. It is served in a small delicate cup without handles, called finjān. Sometimes, the coffee is moved to a larger and more beautiful pour pitcher to serve in front of the guests, called Della. Often, though, the host prepares coffee in the kitchen and highlights a tray of small cups of coffee. unlike Turkish coffee, traditional Arabic coffee, with its roots in Bedouin tradition, is usually unsweetened (qahwah saada), but sugar can be added depending on the preference of drinker. However, this coffee is never sweet syrup, but rather strong and bitter. To make up for the bitter flavor, coffee is usually served with something sweetdates are a traditional accompanimentand other desserts are often served along with a tray of coffee cups.Kanaka also called rikwah or jezwah at Souq Waqif in Doha, Qatar.  Arabian Peninsula  Arabs in the Persian Gulf are also creative in the way they prepare coffee. Coffee is different from that in Egypt and Levant in terms of bitterness and the type of cups the coffee is served in. This brewing method is common in Najd and Hejaz, and sometimes other spices like saffron (to give it a golden color), cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. Arabic coffee in Najd and Hejaz takes a golden color, while in North Arabia a type of Arabic coffee known as qahwah shamālia (literally means Northern Coffee) it looks darker in color, because roasting the coffee beans takes a bit longer. Northern coffee is also known as Bedouin coffee in Jordan. Some people add a little-evaporated milk to slightly alter its color; however, this is rare. It is prepared in and served from a special coffee pot called dallah (); more commonly used is the coffee pot called cezve (also called rikwah or kanaka) and the coffee cups are small with no handle called fenjan. The portions are small, covering just the bottom of the cup. It is served in homes, and in good restaurants by specially clad waiters called gahwaji, and it is almost always accompanied with dates. It is always offered with the compliments of the house.The different types of Arabic coffee with the Hejazi / Najdi golden coffee seen on the left and the Levantine black \\"qahwah sādah\\" (plain coffee) on the right.

Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU), (Originally published by This Week in Palestine) 2006-06-21 Accessed on 2007-12-18 Among Bedouins and most other Arabs throughout the region of Palestine, bitter coffee, known as qahwah sadah (Lit. plain coffee), was a symbol of hospitality. Pouring the drink was ceremonial; it would involve the host or his eldest son moving clockwise among guestswho were judged by age and statuspouring coffee into tiny cups from a brass pot. It was considered \\"polite\\" for guests to accept only three cups of coffee and then end their last cup by saying daymen, meaning \\"always\\", but intending to mean \\"may you always have the means to serve coffee\\".A Taste of Palestine: Menus and Memories (1993).

Corona Publishing Co. p.5 Arab Bedouin from a beehive village in Aleppo, Syria, sipping the traditional murra (bitter) coffee, 1930 In Lebanon, the coffee is prepared in a long-handled coffee pot called \\"rakwe\\". Coffee is poured directly from \\"rakwe\\" to a small cup that is adorned with a decorative pattern, known as a finjān. The finjān has a capacity of 60-90 ml (2-3 oz fl). Lebanese coffee is traditionally strong and black and is similar to the coffee of other Middle Eastern countries. However it differs in its beans and roast, where the blonde and dark beans are mixed together. It is also ground into a very particle like size. It is often joked that a Lebanese person who does not drink coffee is in danger of losing their nationality. Drinks in Syria vary depending on the time of day and the occasion. Arabic coffee is the most well-known hot drink usually prepared in the morning at breakfast or in the evening. It is usually served for guests or after food. Arabic coffee is much more than just a drink in Jordanit is a traditional sign of respect and a way to bring people together. Black, cardamom-flavored Arabic coffee, also known as qahwah sādah (welcome coffee), deeply ingrained in Jordanian culture. Providing coffee (and tea) to guests is a large part of the intimate hospitality of the Hashemite Kingdom.  Morocco  While the national drink of Morocco is gunpowder green tea brewed with fresh mint and espresso is very popular, Arabic coffee is also widely consumed, especially on formal occasions. It is often made with the purpose of conducting a business deal and welcoming someone into one's home for the first time, and frequently served at weddings and on important occasions.  Cultivation  A maqhah in Jerusalem during Ottoman rule in Palestine, 1858 Much of the popularization of coffee is due to its cultivation in the Arab world, beginning in what is now Yemen, by Sufi monks in the 15th century. Through thousands of Arabs pilgrimaging to Mecca, the enjoyment and harvesting of coffee, or the \\"wine of Araby\\" spread to other Arab countries (e.g. Egypt, Syria) and eventually to a majority of the world through the 16th century. Coffee, in addition to being essential in the home, became a major part of social life. Coffeehouses, qahwa قَهوة in Modern Standard Arabic, became \\"Schools of the Wise\\" as they developed into places of intellectual discussion, in addition to centers of relaxation and comradery.  Coffeehouse  Coffeehouse in Cairo, 18th c. Coffeehouse culture began in the Arab world, and eventually spread to other areas of the world and blended with the local culture. Traditional Arab coffeehouses are places where mostly men meet to socialize over games, coffee, and water pipes (shisha or argille). Depending on where the coffeehouse is, its specialty differs. In Maghreb, green tea is served with mint or coffee is served Arab and/or European style. Arabic coffee, or Turkish coffee, is made in Egypt and the Levant countries. Arabic coffee is a very small amount of dark coffee boiled in a pot and presented in a demitasse cup. Particularly in Egypt, coffee is served mazbuuta, which means the amount of sugar will be \\"just right\\", about one teaspoon per cup. However, in the Arabian Peninsula, Arabic coffee is roasted in such a way that the coffee is almost clear. In all of the Arab world, it is traditional for the host to refill the guest's cup until politely signaled that the guest is finished.  Served  An Arab man pours the traditional cup of Arabic coffee in Levant Arabic coffee is usually served just a few centiliters at a time. The waiter/host serves the guest just enough to cover the bottom of the cup. Usually, the coffee is boiling hot, so larger amounts would take too long to cool to a drinkable temperature. The guest drinks it and if he wishes, he will gesture to the waiter not to pour any more. Otherwise, the host/waiter will continue to serve another few centilitres at a time until the guest indicates he has had enough. The most common practice is to drink only one cup since serving coffee serves as a ceremonial act of kindness and hospitality. Sometimes people also drink larger volumes during conversations.  Customs  The cups are normally only filled partway, and the custom is to drink three cups. Arabic coffee has a prominent place in traditional Arab holidays and special events such as Ramadan and Eid.  Fortune-telling  Arabic coffee reading (), is similar to tea-leaf reading; the client is asked to consume strong fresh Arabic coffee leaving approximately a teaspoon of liquid in the cup. The cup is then inverted onto a saucer to allowing the residual liquid to drain away. The reader will then interpret the patterns formed by the thick residue on the inside of the cup.  Funeral  Arabic funerals gather families and extended relatives, who drink bitter and unsweetened coffee and restore the life and characteristics of the deceased. The men and women gather separately, and it has become very fashionable to employ very presentable women whose only job is to serve coffee all day to the women. Male waiters serve the men. Arab Muslims and Christians share this tradition.  Nutrition facts  A small cup of Arabic coffee has almost no calories or fat. It contains a small amount of protein.

Naturalisation as an Icelandic citizen A person may be naturalised as an Icelandic citizen after seven years' residence in Iceland. There are various concessions to the residence requirement: * a reduction to four years for a citizen of another Nordic Council country * where a person is married to (or in a recognised union with) an Icelandic citizen, the residence requirement is reduced to three years. The Icelandic spouse must have held citizenship for five years, and the marriage must have subsisted for four years. * where a person is in a recognised cohabitation with an Icelandic citizen, the residence period is five years and subject to the same criteria as for spouses * a reduction to two years for the child of an Icelandic citizen, provided the parent has held Icelandic citizenship for five years * one year's residence is required for former Icelandic citizens * the residence requirement for recognised refugees is 5 years * a person born in Iceland and not holding any other citizenship may be granted citizenship after three years' residence.

Icelandic citizenship by adoption A person adopted by Icelandic citizens normally acquires Icelandic citizenship on that basis if aged under 12. Where the adoption takes place outside Iceland, an application for citizenship is required. Icelandic citizenship by law Each year, a number of people petition Alþingi to acquire Icelandic citizenship by law. This is usually done if a person does not qualify for acquiring citizenship in any other way. One notable example of this process was the controversial chess champion Bobby Fischer. Loss of Icelandic citizenship Icelandic citizenship used to be lost through the acquisition of another citizenship, and it can in some circumstances be lost as a result of residence outside Iceland: Acquisition of another citizenship An Icelandic citizen who naturalised in another country before 1 July 2003 generally lost Icelandic citizenship automatically. The option to resume citizenship by declaration was available until 1 July 2007. Residence overseas An Icelandic citizen born outside Iceland is liable to lose Icelandic citizenship upon turning age 22 unless: * he or she has taken up residence in Iceland before that time; or * an application is made to retain Icelandic citizenship (renunciation of foreign citizenship is not required). An Icelandic citizen who holds no other nationality cannot lose Icelandic citizenship on this basis. Dual citizenship With effect from 1 July 2003, there are no restrictions on Icelandic citizens holding dual citizenship. Prior to that date, dual citizenship was only permitted in limited circumstances (such as where another citizenship was acquired alongside Icelandic citizenship at birth). Travel freedom of Icelandic citizens Visa requirements for Icelandic citizens Visa requirements for Icelandic citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Iceland. In 2020, Icelandic citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 180 countries and territories, ranking the Icelandic passport 12th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index. The Icelandic nationality is ranked 5th in The Quality of Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Henley Passport Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers in addition to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, human development as well.

The T14 project never came to fruition, as a pilot model was not delivered to the UK until 1944 by which time the British Churchill tank had been in service for two years and greatly improved over its initial model. US efforts working on a similarly well-armoured tank but with a higher speed for use other than in infantry support led to the T20 Medium Tank. Design and development In 1941, the head of the United States Ordnance Department travelled to Britain to learn of their experience, ideas and requirements for the future. Among the discussion was the possibility of designing a well-armed and armoured combat vehicle, one that was stronger than the British Churchill infantry tank then in production. The tank design would have a British QF 6-pounder (57 mm) or a US 75 mm gun and share many parts with the M4 Sherman; they had the same armour thickness, but with sloped armour at extreme angles, effective armour on the T14 was greatly increased to 101 mm.Steven J. Zaloga, Tony Bryan, Jim Laurier M26/M46 Pershing Tank 1943-53 p6 The British initially ordered 8,500 in 1942 following which detail design work started. Testing of the pilot model which was completed in 1944 showed the vehicle to be much too heavy for practical use. By this time, the British Army was satisfied with the Churchill and its cruiser tank designs and further production of the T14 was halted. Only two were built; one tested in the US and the other sent to Britain. The example sent to Britain survives in The Tank Museum, Bovington.

Geography Location The municipality lies in Northern Carinthia in the Gurk Valley among the Nock Mountains and the Gurk. Municipal arrangement Straßburg is divided into the following boroughs: St. Georgen, Straßburg-Land, and Straßburg-Stadt.

Straßburg Castle as seen from the town History Straßburg was first mentioned in 864, when King Louis the German gave the Archdiocese of Salzburg a seat there. The Straßburg Fortress was erected in 1147 under the fourth Bishop of Gurk Roman I. In the 15th century, it was expanded into a castle and it served as the seat of Prince-Bishops of Gurk until the 18th century. As the bishop's seat, Straßburg was the most important town in the Gurk Valley and was thus elevated to a market town in 1229 and to a city in 1382. It received its city rights in 1402 from Prince-Bishop Conrad III von Helfenberg. The seat of the Gurk Bishops was moved in the 18th century to the nearby Pöckstein Castle in Zwischenwässern and then later to Klagenfurt, so the city lost its importance. The castle received extensive damage from the 1767 earthquake and was not rebuilt until the late 20th century. Population According to the 2001 Census, Straßburg has 2,335 inhabitants. Of these, 90.8% said they were Catholic, 1.0% Protestant, and 2.2% Muslim. 3.3% of the population did not declare a belief.

Since the late 19th century, West has been one of the most prominent publishers of legal materials in the United States. Its headquarters is in Eagan, Minnesota; it also had an office in Rochester, New York, until it closed in 2019, and it had an office in Cleveland, Ohio, until it closed in 2010. Organizationally, West is part of the global legal division of Thomson Reuters. History West Publishing was founded by John Briggs West. In 1872, he went into business for himself as \\"John B. West, Publisher and Book Seller\\", reprinting legal treatises, publishing legal forms, and producing a much-appreciated index to the Minnesota statutes. He even arranged for a Swedish-language version of the state's rules of practice, for the state's many Scandinavian-born lawyers and judges.Robt. M. Jarvis, John B. West: Founder of the West Publishing Company\\", Amer. Jl. of Legal History, vol. 50 (Jan. 2008-2010) pages 1-7; Thomas A. Woxland, Forever Associated with the Practice of Law: The early years of West Publishing Company, Legal Reference Services Qly, vol. 5 (Spring 1985) page 115. In 1876 his business had expanded to the point that he took on his older brother, Horatio (1848-1936) as a partner, and in 1882, with a couple of outside investors, the enterprise was incorporated as \\"West Publishing Company\\".Robt. M. Jarvis, John B. West: Founder of the West Publishing Company\\", Amer. Jl. of Legal History, vol. 50 (Jan. 2008-2010) pages 7-8. Their first continuing publication was The Syllabi, a collection of the summaries of all, and the full texts of some, of the decisions of the State and federal courts of Minnesota; this proved so popular that in 1877 it was expanded to include the courts of Wisconsin and renamed The North Western Reporter and within a couple of years added coverage of several more states and became the cornerstone of what was to become West's National Reporter System., a system of regional reporters, each of which became known for reporting state court appellate decisions within its region. The West brothers also introduced the American Digest System, prefacing the court decisions with \\"headnotes\\" quoting (as nearly verbatim as possible) the holdings of the decision and categorized with key numbers so that analogous holdings from different decisions and even from different states could be grouped together. Thomas A. Woxland, Forever Associated with the Practice of Law: The early years of West Publishing Company, Legal Reference Services Qly, vol. 5 (Spring 1985) page 120. The West company was embroiled in at least three crucial lawsuits early in its history, which established that state court decisions were in the public domain and not copyrighted (although West's headnotes and key number system could be copyrighted).Thomas A. Woxland, Forever Associated with the Practice of Law: The early years of West Publishing Company, Legal Reference Services Qly, vol. 5 (Spring 1985) page 122.

Davies, How West Law was Made: The company, its products, and its promotions, Charleston Law Rev., vol. 6 (Winter 2012) page 237; and a 1901 publication by West Publishing itself, Law Books by the Million, reprinted in Green Bag 2d, vol. 14 (Spring 2011) page 311. West also reports decisions of the federal Courts of Appeals in the Federal Reporter and of the federal district courts in the Federal Supplement, and retroactively republished the decisions of all lower federal courts predating the NRS in Federal Cases. All these reporters are also part of the NRS (National Reporter System), meaning that all cases published therein are annotated with headnotes by West attorney-editors, and all those headnotes are then indexed in the West American Digest System (and its electronic version, KeyCite) for easy cross- referencing. Technically, all of West's reporters were originally unofficial reporters published without the express authorization or endorsement of the courts. West reporters have become the nationwide de facto standard used by all federal courts and most state courts, despite their technically unofficial nature. Indeed, over 20 states have discontinued publication of their own official reporters, and a few states with West's cooperation began inserting certificates in the volumes of the relevant West regional reporter to certify it as their official reporter. Both brothers retired to southern California.Robt. M. Jarvis, John B. West: Founder of the West Publishing Company\\", Amer. Jl. of Legal History, vol. 50 (Jan. 2008-2010) page 17. In 1995 West retained the services of A.G. Edwards and Goldman Sachs in a search for potential purchasers. Thomson purchased West in 1996. Thomson also consolidated into West a number of other law book companies purchased by either Thomson or West, including Bancroft-Whitney, Banks-Baldwin, Barclay, Callaghan & Company, Clark Boardman, Foundation Press, Gilbert's, Harrison, Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, and Warren, Gorham & Lamont. Today, West also publishes some treatise titles purchased from Shepard's (but not Shepard's Citations). Through these acquisitions, Thomson has become one of the \\"big three\\" legal publishers, along with LexisNexis and Wolters Kluwer. Following the acquisition by Thomson, West was known as WIPG, West Information Publishing Group. From 1997 to 2004, West was known as \\"West Group\\". In 2009/2010 West began offering buyouts to its U.S. editorial staff as it began to move editorial production overseas.

Louisa was born in Reykjavík. She showed artistic ability at an early age, and studied first in Denmark and then under Marcel Gromaire in Paris. Her early paintings, dating from the late 1930s, established her as a leading figure in the Icelandic avant-garde community (many of whom met together in a house in Reykjavík called Unuhús). In these paintings, subjects are painted with a broad brush, emphasizing geometric form. These paintings already show much of the character of Louisa's mature work, but are more subdued in color. Her move to New York City in 1942 was followed by a period of study under Hans Hofmann, along with other painters including Robert De Niro, Sr. (father of the actor) and Jane Freilicher. In 1944 she married painter Leland Bell, and until Bell's death in 1991 they enjoyed a partnership of mutual support. Louisa's first solo exhibition took place at Jane Street Gallery in New York in 1948. While her work of the 1950s saw her introducing elements of expressionism, from the 1960s until the end of her life she developed and refined the idiom of forthright color, uncluttered composition and brisk execution for which she is best known. The paintings of Louisa's final three decades include Icelandic landscapes, a series of self- portraits, and tabletop still-life arrangements. The landscapes often include charmingly stylized depictions of Icelandic horses and sheep. She was to remain an Icelandic citizen all her life, the physical characteristics of her native land informing her bold treatment of form and clarity of light. The poet John Ashbery described the result as the \\"flavor, both mellow and astringent, which no other painter gives us.\\"Perl, 1999, p. 9.

Career Adair was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge, and took a B.A. in 1764, and M.A. in 1767. He was educated in law and a due course called to the bar by the society of Lincoln's Inn. In the early part of the reign of George III he was ranked among the advocates of the popular side; in 1771, he was employed as counsel in the famous case of the House of Commons against the printers of Letters of Junius, and in this and other instances gave so much satisfaction to the citizens, that, on the death of John Glynn, he was elected Recorder of London, a post he held until 1789. In 1774, he took the degree of serjeant-at-law and afterwards confined his practice chiefly to the Court of Common Pleas. On his promotion to be a king's serjeant in 1782, he took the lead in that court for several years. Following the split of the Whig Party after the French Revolution, he attached himself to the moderate party of Edmund Burke's division. In 1794 he was one of the counsels for the crown against Thomas Hardy, Horne Tooke, and others, but had no very active part assigned him. In April 1788 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society In 1796, he led against the crown, with Thomas Erskine as his junior, in defence of William Stone, who was accused of treason but acquitted. He was counsel to the Board of Ordnance, and also served as Chief Justice of Chester from 1796 to his death. Politics At different times Adair held a seat in Parliament. He sat as MP for Cockermouth from 1775 to 1780, and from 1793 until his death was a member for Higham Ferrers. Conduct His manner as a speaker was somewhat coarse, but it was impressive. He had great copiousness and fluency of delivery, and his powers of reasoning were of the highest order. Death and burial Adair died suddenly at his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, on 21 July 1798. He was buried in Bunhill Fields burial ground. Works Adair was author of several tracts. *Thoughts on the Dismission of Officers for their Conduct in Parliament (1764). *Observations on the Power of Alienation in the Crown (1768). *Discussions of the Law of Libels (1785).

The Diocese of Dunkeld was one of the 13 historical dioceses of Scotland preceding the abolition of Episcopacy in 1689. History It is thought that the diocese was constituted as far back as the middle of the ninth century. The first occupant was styled Bishop of Fortriu, the name by which the kingdom of the northern Picts was then known. This bishop was also styled Abbot of Dunkeld, perhaps holding jurisdiction, formerly enjoyed by Iona, over the other Columban monasteries in Scotland. The new bishopric appears to have included a great part of what afterwards became the Diocese of Argyll, and retained its jurisdiction over various churches representing old Columban foundations. There were thirty-five bishops of Dunkeld from its foundation until the suppression of the Catholic hierarchy during the Protestant Reformation in the sixteenth century. The Catholic cathedral, situated in the Perthshire town of Dunkeld, was erected between 1220 and 1500. After the Reformation the cathedral fell partly into ruins, although the choir is used for Presbyterian worship. Despite the Reformation and the hostility of the new Church of Scotland to bishops, episcopacy was not finally abolished until 1689, although there had been a temporary abolition from 1638 until the beginning of the 1660s. The diocese was restored by the Catholic Church (with a different boundary), on 4 March 1878, by Pope Leo XIII. The new Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunkeld is one of the suffragan sees of the archiepiscopal province of St. Andrews and Edinburgh, and includes the counties of Perth, Angus, Clackmannan, Kinross, and the northern part of Fife. The diocesan cathedral, now dedicated to Saint Andrew rather than Columba, is located in Dundee, the residence of the great majority of the Catholics of the modern diocese. The cathedral chapter, erected in 1895, consists of a provost and eight canons. Bishops Parishes Cathedral of St Columba at Dunkeld. It now operates as a Church of Scotland church.

From the 1920s through 1945, he worked for Ford Motor Company and was best known as the head of Ford’s \\"service department\\", the company's internal security agency. While working for Henry Ford, Bennett's union busting tactics made him an enemy of the United Auto Workers (UAW) trade union. He gained infamy for his involvement in activities such as in the Battle of the Overpass, a 1937 incident where UAW members protesting for higher wages were assaulted by Ford security guards. He had various residences in Michigan, including Bennett's Lodge near Farwell, a log cabin-style house in East Tawas, and Bennett's Castle, an estate located on the Huron River in Ypsilanti, where he kept pet lions and tigers. After being fired by Henry Ford II in 1945, Bennett left Michigan to live in California. On January 4, 1979, Bennett died in Los Gatos, California, of undisclosed causes.Ann Arbor News (January 13, 1979) \\"Ford Friend Harry Bennett Dies\\" Retrieved on 2015-05-27 Biography Harry Bennett was born in 1892. He went to common schools. As a youth, Bennett started competing in boxing and won some city bouts. He served in the Navy during World War I. Career In the early days of Ford Motor Company a security department operated under the name of the Ford Service Department. It was to try to control the growing labor unrest and suppress the emerging labor unions. Ford had instituted a policy called \\"speed up\\", by which the speed of the assembly lines was increased slightly every week, and employees were feeling the strain. The labor issues sometimes led to violent clashes between Ford's management, the police, and some workers. Henry Ford needed someone able to handle rough situations as head of his Service Department.  Ford Service Department  Harry Bennett served as the head of the Ford Motor Company Service Department for over two decades, beginning in 1921. Bennett was and in great physical shape due to his years of boxing and service in the Navy. Legend traces Bennett's relationship to Ford Motor Company to a 1916 street brawl in New York City. At the time, Bennett, 24, was a sailor and was just off his ship. He was saved from being thrown into jail by an acquaintance of Henry Ford, Bernie Ghers, who happened to witness the fight while on his way to a meeting with Ford. Ghers, a Hearst newspaper columnist who had credibility with the police, convinced them that Bennett was not at fault, so they released Bennett without charges. On the spur of the moment, Ghers decided to take Bennett along with him to see Ford. At the meeting, Ford was more interested in Bennett's prowess in the street fight than the business at hand, and he offered Bennett a security job at the Rouge plant. Bennett's interview for the job was reported to be short. He was asked only one question by Ford as to his capabilities. \\"Can you shoot?\\" asked Henry. He could. Bennett was known for talking and acting tough around the Ford plants. For target practice, Bennett would fire BB's from an air pistol at a small target mechanism on a filing cabinet in his basement office at the Rouge. Visitors and co-workers were puzzled by the muffled sounds of pellets striking the target. Bennett kept lions as pets at his Ann Arbor estate. He startled fellow executives by bringing the \\"big cats\\" to his office and painting images of them. \\"Harry Bennett used to sit at his desk, with his feet up on the desk, and a target at the other end of the room and fire a 45 target practice in his office and if someone was invited in to have a meeting with him they better make certain that his presence was properly announced or they may have intercepted one of those.\\"A&E;: \\"The History of the Mob in America\\". Bennett soon recruited a collection of football players, boxers, wrestlers and Detroit river gang members as Service Department employees. He knew nothing about making cars, but he did not need to. Bennett's close relationship with Henry Ford and his ability to get things done made him a success. All Henry had to do was ask, \\"Can you take care of that, Harry?\\" and it was done. Bennett was so loyal to Henry Ford that when a journalist asked Bennett during an interview, \\"If Henry Ford asked you to black out the sky tomorrow, what would you do?\\" Bennett thought for a moment and said, \\"I might have a little trouble arranging that one but you'd see 100,000 workers coming through the plant gates with dark glasses on tomorrow.\\" In the mid-1920s, Bennett often drove to Ford's Fair Lane mansion to ask his boss if there was anything he could do for him. By the time the Model A production was in full swing in 1928–29, the morning meetings had become a habit. For the better part of 20 years, Bennett spent his days at Henry Ford's side. Bennett led Ford's opposition to the Ford Hunger March of unemployed workers on March 7, 1932. Dearborn police and Ford service department men including Bennett opened fire on the protesters as they advanced toward the Ford River Rouge Complex. Four marchers were shot to death, and Bennett himself was hospitalized after being hit by a rock. Upon the 1943 death of company president Edsel Ford, the founder's overshadowed son, Bennett was Henry Ford's choice to succeed Edsel. However, Edsel Ford's widow blamed Bennett for her husband's early death and effectively vetoed the appointment. Instead, Henry Ford appointed Bennett to the Ford Motor Company board of directors. After some attempted shenanigans with Henry Ford's will which would have given Bennett control over the company, the Ford women stepped in and demanded Bennett's ouster. In September 1945, Henry Ford II was summoned to Ford's estate and informed that he would be the new president of Ford Motor Company. As his first act, Henry Ford II, then 28, had John Bugas hand Bennett his walking papers (after which Bennett and Bugas drew pistols on each other). Bennett told the younger Ford, \\"You're taking over a billion-dollar company that you haven't contributed a thing to.\\" That afternoon, on September 21, 1945, Bennett departed, ending his 30-year career with the Ford Motor Company.Wilson, Amy, \\"The Rise and Fall of Harry Bennett,\\" Automotive News, June 2, 2003, Retrieved February 1, 2019. The ruthless Bennett era was finally over. Afterward, Henry Ford II went to Ford to tell him of his first executive decision: \\"I went to him (Henry Ford) with my guard up. I was sure he was going to blow my head off.\\" Ford quite nonchalantly said, \\"Well, now Harry is back on the streets where he started.\\"  Residences  Bennett's lodge Bennett had a lodge built for him in Freeman Township, Michigan, on Lost Lake. The house is constructed of brick and concrete block with concrete siding fashioned to make it look like a log cabin. It has wooden floors and wall paneling, a 128-foot (39 m) long porch, and a stone fireplace. Chairs and sofas for the house were custom made by the finest craftsmen and upholstered using the highest grade of leather that Ford acquired for use in their most luxurious automobiles of the era. The swimming pool beside the house provided more than the usual entertainment to Bennett and his guests: The pool was constructed with a viewing room (complete with wet bar) adjacent to the pool. A glass window looked into the pool under water, so Harry and company could enjoy watching their female guests swim. Since Bennett was always worried about being under attack, he included many security features in the lodge. The lodge was surrounded by a moat full of pointed posts. The bridge over the moat was kept loaded with dynamite. The lodge has many custom features. Hidden behind a hinged bookcase in the study is a secret passageway which leads to the dock. Every step of the staircase in the passageway is a different height from the others to make tripping more likely. Bennett would practice running down the steps to memorize their spacing in order to give him an advantage if pursued. One hidden room had access to a central point in the ventilation system, where conversations from multiple rooms could be clearly overheard. The roof of the building featured a guard station parapet at one end, complete with a fireplace to keep Bennett's men warm while on 24-hour armed watch when Bennett was at the lodge in colder months. Bennett had a private airfield with an airplane at the other end of Lost Lake. In the event of an attack, Bennett could take the secret passageway, emerge by the dock, take a boat across the lake, and escape by airplane. An attack never came. The lodge and property were purchased in 1964 by the Boy Scouts of America, Clinton Valley Council. The property was developed for the Lost Lake Scout Reservation. The lodge was abandoned after the reservation was closed. Much of the furniture remains, but the pool has fallen into disrepair. Trees have been planted on the airfield. Bennett's hideouts Harry Bennett had a similar outpost on the north side of Geddes Road west of Prospect Road about from his estate near Ypsilanti. It was a concrete cabin constructed to look like a log cabin. A hidden door disguised as a book shelf rotated to reveal access to an upper level hide designed to be a look out. This was behind the fireplace and lead to a place with gun ports for defense. Near this cabin was an underground bunker, including a separate building with a Ford engine [flathead engine V8 engine} acting as a generator to make the property self sustaining. The bunker was similar to the ones at Ford's Fair Lane estate. The compound also was a sugar bush that produced maple syrup. The property included a curbed circular drive however at the time of my observation it was not possible to determine where there was access to the main road as the surrounding property was used as active farm fields. The barn on Geddes road had a cornerstone with \\"Harry Bennett\\" inscribed. Bennett had a second hideout for himself, his family, his henchmen, and his visiting boss Henry Ford, consisting of a group of buildings, a compound with 14 bedrooms, a 40 foot indoor pool, indoor sauna, and a barbeque pit over 60 acres on a hill overlooking the Sky Valley desert 15 minutes from Palm Springs, California. The property came equipped with its own well, capable of producing 100 gallons a minute of hot fresh water.https://kennethholland.com/harry-bennett-hideout/ Later life and death After burning his Ford Motor Company records in his basement office after Henry Ford II fired him there, Bennett retired to an 800 acre estate and wilderness area he owned near Desert Springs, California. His last public appearance came when he was called to testify in the Kefauver Senate Crime Investigation Committee Hearings in 1951, in the same year he published his memoirs on his time at Ford. He then retreated into private life in obscurity out of the spotlight, enjoying good health until he was 80. The last six years of his life were spent in declining health. In 1973, Bennett suffered a major stroke. In 1975, he entered the Beverly Manor Nursing Home in Los Gatos, California, where on January 4, 1979, he died. His death went unreported for a week. The cause of death was not released to the public at that time.

He was then created the first Marquess of Milford Haven in the peerage of the United Kingdom. From 1917, therefore, his daughter was known as \\"Lady Louise Mountbatten\\". Her mother was Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Louise was a sister of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, and of Princess Alice of Battenberg, who was the mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. She was also a niece of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia. Alice in 1889 Because of her father's work, the family moved around between different territories in the British Empire, such as Malta, but they returned often to the Heiligenberg outside Darmstadt which they considered their holiday home, always retaining a residence in England. Louise often visited her great-grandmother Queen Victoria on the Isle of Wight with her mother during her childhood. The family is described as harmonious; the parents of Louise lived in a happy loving relationship, not in an arranged marriage, and Louise was particularly close to her brother, with whom she corresponded until her death. Louise and her sister were educated by governesses, except for a brief period at Texter's girls school in Darmstadt. In 1914, Louise and her mother visited the Russian Empire, and were invited to a trip down the Volga with their Imperial relatives. During her visit, Louise noted the influence of Rasputin with concern. The trip was interrupted by the sudden outbreak of the First World War, and Louise's father telegraphed for them to return immediately. Louise's mother gave her jewellery to the empress for safe keeping, and they left Russia by boat from Hapsal in Estonia and travelled to neutral Sweden, paying for the trip with gold, as their money was suddenly not acceptable currency in Russia. They stayed in Sweden as guests of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf and Crown Princess Margaret, her first cousin once removed, at Drottningholm Palace, just one night before they returned to Great Britain. During the First World War, Louise was first active within the Soldiers and Sailors Families Association and the Smokes for Soldiers and Sailors, but she soon enlisted in the Red Cross for service as a nurse. She was active at a French military hospital in Nevers, and then at a war hospital at Palaves outside Montpellier, from March 1915 until July 1917. She was commended for her hard work, and was awarded The British War and Victory Medals, a medal from the British Red Cross, as well as the Médaille de la Reconnaissance française. After the war, she was active in social work for the children in the slums of Battersea in London. Courtships In 1909, Louise received a proposal from Manuel II of Portugal. Her grand-uncle, Edward VII, the British monarch, was in favour of the match, but Louise declined, as she wished to marry for love. At the age of twenty, Louise became secretly engaged to Prince Christopher of Greece, but they were forced to give up their relationship for financial reasons. Shortly before World War I broke out, Louise fell in love with a man of whom her parents approved but he was killed in the early days of the war.Hugo Vickers. Alice, Princess Andrew of Greece. Macmillan, 2003, pp. 127–130. Later during the war, while she volunteered as a nurse in Nevers, she began a relationship with Alexander Stuart-Hill, a Scottish artist living in Paris. Anticipating that her parents would be disappointed in her choice, Louise kept their engagement a secret. Eventually, she confided in her parents, who were initially understanding, and invited Stuart-Hill for visits at Kent House twice. In fact, her family, referring to him as \\"Shakespeare\\" because of his odd appearance, found him \\"eccentric\\" and \\"affected\\". Lacking resources, the engaged couple agreed to postpone marriage until after the war. But in 1918 Louise's father explained to her that Stuart- Hill was most likely homosexual, and that a marriage with him was impossible. Wedding portrait from 1923 of Lady Louise and Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf In 1923 Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, having been for three years the widower of Louise's mother's cousin Princess Margaret of Connaught, paid a visit to London and, to Louise's surprise, began to court her. Although as a young woman Louise had said that she would never marry a king or a widower, she accepted the proposal of a man destined to be both. However, under §5 of the 1810 Swedish Succession Law (Act 1810:0926), a prince of the Swedish royal house forfeited his right of succession to the throne if he \\"with or without the King's knowledge and consent, married a private Swedish or foreign man's daughter\\" (med eller utan Konungens vetskap och samtycke, tager till gemål enskild svensk eller utländsk mans dotter). Once the couple's engagement was announced, there were lively discussions in the media about whether the bride- to-be was constitutionally eligible to become Sweden's future queen.Lindorm, Erik. Ny svensk historia, Gustaf V och hans tid 1919–1927, 1979, page 240. In response the Swedish Foreign Ministry, citing the law in question, clarified the term \\"a private Swedish or foreign man's daughter\\" to mean \\"he who did not belong to a sovereign family or to a family which, according to international practice, would not be equal thereto\\" (som icke vore medlem av suverän familj eller familj som enligt internationell praxis vore därmed likställd), and announced that the Swedish government had \\"requested the British government's explanation of Lady Louise Mountbatten's position in this respect.\\" The ministry further announced that following the British government's reply to its inquiry and the subsequent investigation into the matter, it had been determined that the Crown Prince's choice of a future wife was in compliance with the succession law, thereby concluding debate on the imminent nuptials. On 27 October 1923 Sweden and Britain's respective plenipotentiaries signed the \\"Treaty between Great Britain and Sweden for the Marriage of Lady Louise Mountbatten with His Royal Highness Prince Gustaf Adolf, Crown Prince of Sweden\\". The treaty stated, in part, that the kings of the United Kingdom and Sweden \\"having judged it proper that an alliance should again be contracted between their respective Royal Houses by a marriage...have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles\\", which articles declared that the marriage would be celebrated in London and duly authenticated, that the couple's financial settlements would be expressed in a separate marriage contract which was declared to be \\"an integral part of the present Treaty\\", and that the two nations' ratifications of the treaty would be exchanged in Stockholm, which formally occurred 12 November 1923. On 3 November 1923, at age 34, Louise married Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, in the Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace in the presence of George V and members of both royal families. Crown princess Louise adorned with regal ornaments in her time as crown princess The marriage between Louise and Gustav Adolf was by all accounts a love match and described as very happy. She was also liked by her mother-in-law because of her friendly nature, although they seldom saw each other, as Queen Victoria spent most of her time in Italy. The fact that the queen spent most of her time abroad meant that Louise took on many royal duties from the beginning, which was initially hard for her as she was at this point described as quite shy. After the queen's death in 1930, Louise was officially the first lady of the nation, expected to perform all the duties of a queen, twenty years before she actually became queen. This meant that Louise was to take over the protection of all the organisations and associations traditionally assigned to the queen. She was made the protector of the Swedish Red Cross, Children's Hospital of Crown Princess Louise, Eugenia Home, Drottningens centralkommitté ('Queen's Emergency Relief Committee'), Arbetsflitens Befrämjande ('The Promoting of Diligence'), Sophiahemmet and Svenska Hemslöjdsföreningarns Riksförbund ('Swedish Handicraft's Society'). Regarding this matter, Louise remarked: \\"It is hard for me to be the protector of different institutions, as I have been accustomed to practical work, as an ordinary person, before my marriage\\". As a former nurse, a fact she was proud to point out, Louise was interested in improving the working conditions for nurses. Louise's only child, a daughter, was stillborn on 30 May 1925. In 1926–1927, the crown princely couple made an international trip around the world to benefit Swedish interests, which was described as a great success, especially the trip to the United States, during which they travelled across the nation from New York City to San Francisco. Public interest was high, and the couple acquired a reputation for being \\"democratic\\", after having refused such formalities as greeting the guests at a reception sitting on thrones, which they had been invited to do at the reception of an American millionaire. During an interview in Salt Lake City, Louise stated that she believed in gender equality and that women are fully capable of being active within all professions and in the business world, as well as within politics: \\"Women are completely intellectually equal to men and, provided they are given sufficient education, are just as capable to deserve respect and admiration as men in this field\\". In 1934–35, she made a similar trip with Gustav Adolf to Greece and around the Middle East and Africa, called the Orient Tour. In 1936, Louise attended the funeral of George V of Great Britain. The Crown Prince and Crown Princess in 1945 During World War II, Louise was active in aid work within the Red Cross. She collected candles and other non-electric light sources for the needy during the campaign \\"Vinterljus\\" (English: Winter Lights). Another contribution was Kronprinsessans Gåvokommitté för Neutralitetsvakten (English:\\"The Crown Princess Gift Association For the Neutral Defence Forces\\"), which provided the soldiers mobilised to guard the borders of neutral Sweden with gifts: normally socks, scarfs and caps knitted by contributors from all over the country. As a citizen of a neutral country, Louise was also able to act as a messenger between relatives and friends across warfaring borders. She also provided supplies to many private citizens in this way, such as \\"two old ladies in Münich\\", the former German language teacher of her husband's late wife, and the exiled Princess Tatiana of Russia in Palestine. It is said many would have died, had it not been for Louise's help. In 1940, for example, she sent supplies to the British major Michael Smiley at the Rifle Brigade, who was captured and placed in a prisoner of war camp, after his mother-in-law Alicia Pearson had asked for her help. During the Finnish Winter War, Louise set up a home for Finnish war orphans at Ulriksdal Palace. Queen In 1950, Louise became queen after accession to the throne of her husband. Louise is described as a true democrat at heart, and was therefore somewhat disturbed at being celebrated merely in her capacity of queen. In reference to the attention, she remarked: \\"People look at me as if I were something special. Surely I do not look differently today from how I looked yesterday!\\" Louise disliked the strict pre-World War I protocol at court, retained during her mother-in-law's era, and reformed it when she became queen, instituting new guidelines in 1954 which democraticised many old customs. In 1962, she abolished the court presentations, replaced them with \\"democratic ladies' lunches\\", to which she invited professional career women, a custom which was to continue under Princess Sibylla after her death. Louise also renovated and redecorated the interior of the Royal Palace in Stockholm. Queen Louise in 1963 Louise was described as eccentric for royalty and temperamental; she could get very angry, but was said to possess a good heart, a great sense of humour, a sense of self-irony and was able to distinguish between herself and her royal role. She could show her sympathies openly, and this was taken as a sign of her honesty. One courtier commented, \\"I would describe the queen as a 'gentleman'. She would never avoid acknowledging her own mistakes\\". Louise is described as a great lover and patriot of her new home country, and was often shocked by Swedish non- patriotic customs. She was a supporter of the political system and democracy in the form it had developed in Sweden and stated her opinion to her relatives that no other political system than the Swedish one had created such a happy development for any nation. Queen Louise also admired Swedish nature and in particular Swedish women, because of what she considered their natural dignity regardless of class, and remarked that she had never seen a country with less vulgarity than Sweden. Queen Louise had several Pomeranian dogs which she would hide about her person when visiting abroad which caused problems when travelling through customs (which she usually did under the pseudonym \\"Countess of Gripsholm\\" or \\"Mrs Olsson\\"). After having taken summer vacations with her husband in Italy every year, she always departed before he did to visit England prior to returning to Sweden. A popular story told of her alleges that Louise, after almost being hit by a bus in London (because she would often jay-walk), took to carrying a small card with the words, \\"I am the Queen of Sweden\\" printed on it, so that people would know who she was in case she was hit by a vehicle. In London, she often stayed at the Hyde Park Hotel, often crossing a heavily trafficked street there to shop, which prompted her note. In 1963, Louise accompanied her spouse on a state visit to France, where she made a great impression on President Charles de Gaulle. At dinner, she said to him: \\"I must ask you to excuse my ugly French. My French is the one spoken in the trenches of 1914.\\" De Gaulle later attended her memorial service in Paris, which was the first occasion for a French president to visit the Swedish church there, as well as one of only two occasions de Gaulle visited a memorial service of the kind. Queen Louise's last official engagement was the Nobel Prize dinner of 1964, during which no one noticed that she was in fact already ill. Death Margaret on Karlsborg Island in Solna, Sweden Queen Louise died on 7 March 1965 at Saint Göran Hospital, in Stockholm, Sweden, following emergency surgery after a period of severe illness. She had made her last public appearance at the Nobel Prize Ceremony in December 1964. Queen Louise is buried beside her husband and his first wife, Crown Princess Margaret, in the Royal Cemetery in Solna north of Stockholm.

Burton immigrated with his family to Canada from England in 1952 at the age of 10. He grew up in Prince George, British Columbia. In the early 1960s, he worked as a highway surveyor and then as a bulk plant manager for Shell Petroleum. He began his small business in 1964, and operated it until he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2000 federal election as the Canadian Alliance Member of Parliament (MP) for Skeena riding. Burton entered politics in the 1970s. During his 24-year municipal career, he served as Mayor of Stewart, British Columbia for six years, and town councillor for 18 years. He joined the Reform Party of Canada at its formation in 1987, and remained a member of its successors, the Canadian Alliance and the Conservative Party of Canada. In his tenure in Parliament, Burton served variously as Canadian Alliance Critic for Public Works, Fisheries and Natural Resources and then as the Conservative Party's Fisheries and Oceans critic. On June 25, 2001, Burton was one of a dozen MPs who were expelled from or left the Canadian Alliance caucus due to their criticisms of Stockwell Day's leadership and sat as \\"Independent Alliance\\" MPs. In early September, an offer was made to the MPs that they would be readmitted to the Alliance caucus if they promised to refrain from criticizing Day's leadership. Burton accepted the offer along with four other dissident MPs, while the rest refused and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus. Burton rejoined the Canadian Alliance caucus on September 10, 2001. Burton is a social conservative, and an opponent of abortion rights and same- sex marriage. Burton's riding was merged into the reconfigured riding of Skeena—Bulkley Valley for the 2004 federal election, and he lost by just over 1,300 votes by Nathan Cullen of the New Democratic Party. In November 2006, Burton ran in and won a municipal by-election in Burns Lake, British Columbia.

The charts represented major ocean swell patterns and the ways the islands disrupted those patterns, typically determined by sensing disruptions in ocean swells by islands during sea navigation. Most stick charts were made from the midribs of coconut fronds that were tied together to form an open framework. Island locations were represented by shells tied to the framework, or by the lashed junction of two or more sticks. The threads represented prevailing ocean surface wave-crests and directions they took as they approached islands and met other similar wave-crests formed by the ebb and flow of breakers. Individual charts varied so much in form and interpretation that the individual navigator who made the chart was the only person who could fully interpret and use it. The use of stick charts ended after World War II when new electronic technologies made navigation more accessible and travel among islands by canoe lessened. Significance of stick charts to the history of cartography The stick charts are a significant contribution to the history of cartography because they represent a system of mapping ocean swells, which was never before accomplished. They also use different materials from those common in other parts of the world. They are an indication that ancient maps may have looked very different, and encoded different features from the earth, from the maps that we use today. The charts, unlike traditional maps, were studied and memorized prior to a voyage and were not consulted during a trip, as compared to traditional navigation techniques where consultation of a map is frequent and points and courses are plotted out both before and during navigation. Marshallese navigators used their senses and memory to guide them on voyages by crouching down or lying prone in the canoe to feel how the canoe was being pitched and rolled by underlying swells. Ocean swells recognized by Marshallese The Marshallese recognized four main ocean swells: the rilib, kaelib, bungdockerik and bundockeing. Navigators focused on effects of islands in blocking swells and generating counterswells to some degree, but they mainly concentrated on refraction of swells as they came in contact with undersea slopes of islands and the bending of swells around islands as they interacted with swells coming from opposite directions. The four types of ocean swells were represented in many stick charts by curved sticks and threads. Rilib swells Rilib swells are the strongest of the four ocean swells and were referred to as \\"backbone\\" swells. They are generated by the northeast trade winds and are present during the entire year, even when they do not penetrate as far south as the Marshall Islands. Marshallese considered the rilib swells to come from the east, even though the angle of the winds as well as the impact of the ocean currents varied the swell direction. Kaelib swells The kaelib swell is weaker than the rilib and could only be detected by knowledgeable persons, but it is also present year round. Bungdockerik swells The bungdockerik is present year round as well and arises in the southwest. This swell is often as strong as the rilib in the southern islands. Bundockeing swells The bundockeing swell is the weakest of the four swells, and is mainly felt in the northern islands. Stick chart categories The stick charts typically fall into three main categories: mattang, meddo (or medo), and rebbelib (or rebbelith). Mattang charts The mattang stick chart was an abstract chart used for instruction and for teaching principles of reading how islands disrupt swells. Meddo charts The meddo chart showed actual islands and their relative or exact positions. Meddo charts also showed the direction of main deep ocean swells, the way the swells curved around specific islands and intersected with one another, and distance from a canoe at which an island could be detected. The meddo chart portrayed only a section of one of the two main island chains. Rebbelib charts Rebbelib charts portrayed the same information as a meddo chart, but the difference lies in inclusiveness of the islands. Rebbelib charts, unlike meddo charts, included all or most of one or both chains of islands. Passing on stick chart knowledge Stick charts were not made and used by all Marshall Islanders. Only a select few rulers knew the method of making the maps, and the knowledge was only passed on from father to son. So that others could utilize the expertise of the navigator, fifteen or more canoes sailed together in a squadron, accompanied by a leader pilot skilled in use of the charts. It was not until 1862 that this unique piloting system was revealed in a public notice prepared by a resident missionary. It was not until the 1890s that it was comprehensively described by a naval officer, Captain Winkler of the Imperial German Navy. At the Internet Archive. Winkler had been the commander of the , stationed in 1896 in the Marshall Islands which, during that period, were under German rule; he subsequently described the system in an 1898 publication. Winkler became so intrigued by the stick charts that he made a major effort to determine navigational principles behind them and convinced the navigators to share how the stick charts were used.

These flightless dark colored insects are comparatively large; the males range from 19 to 23 mm and the females from 17 to 22 mm. Habitat Gryllus campestris used to be common over most of Western Europe. It prefers dry, sunny locations with short vegetation, like dry grasslands. At the northern edge of its range, it is restricted to heathlands and oligotrophic grasslands. The species is flightless and unable to migrate long distances, and it therefore does not commonly recover on its own from local extinction. Reproduction The reproductive season of the univoltine species lasts from May to July. The males make a burrow with a platform at the entrance from which they attract females with their courtship stridulation. They chirp during daytime as well as the first part of the night, only when the temperature is well above 13 °C. Nymphs hatch in June till mid July and hibernate during their tenth or eleventh instar. The final moult takes place at the end of April or at the beginning of May. Males are territorial and defend their burrows fiercely, while females are vagrant and are attracted by singing males. They lay their eggs in bare ground either close to a burrow or inside the burrow. Populations of G. campestris are known to undergo extreme fluctuations and are strongly affected by weather conditions. Threats Gryllus campestris has long been considered the most endangered cricket species in the British Isles, occurring only in southern England. It is declining and red-listed in large parts of Central and Northern Europe, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and Lithuania. It has declined severely in part of its northern range due to the disappearance of its heathland habitat; by the early 1990s the species was reduced in the UK to a single surviving colony of just 100 individuals in Coates, West Sussex.  Conservation efforts  Fragmentation of habitats and loss of (sub-)populations have been recognized as main threats for many species, including the Field cricket. The artificial establishment of new populations is, therefore, a consistent method for enhancing the survival probability of a species. The aim of translocation projects is usually to reduce the risk of extinction for an endangered species by creating additional self-sustaining populations.

Translocation of nymphs from different subpopulations may in fact be a suitable method to decrease the loss of genetic diversity and reduce the risk of inbreeding, and large numbers of nymphs may be translocated without negative effect on the source population.K.

In mammals, it exists distinctly only in the embryonic heart (where it is found between the two venae cavae); however, the sinus venosus persists in the adult.

The sinus venosus also forms the SA node and the coronary sinus; in (most) mammals only. In the embryo, the thin walls of the sinus venosus are connected below with the right ventricle, and medially with the left atrium, but are free in the rest of their extent. It receives blood from the vitelline vein, umbilical vein and common cardinal vein.

Life From 1735 he resided there for 40 years and was almost entirely cut off from the outside world. From 1744 he resided chiefly among the Chickasaw. In 1751, Adair moved to Laurens County, South Carolina. In the 1740s he led a British trade mission to the Eastern Choctaw tribe at the height of King George's War in an effort to win this nation over from French influence. He dealt extensively with Chief Red Shoes, the leader of the pro-British faction of the Choctaw. This eventually erupted into a fierce civil war amongst the Choctaw that led to Red Shoes assassination in 1749.History of the American Indians by James Adair, pg 143-148. Adair went forward under the direction of James Glen, governor of South Carolina, but then vehemently blames him for the mission's failure and the loss of his personal fortune. In the 1760s he led a contingent of Chickasaw Warriors against the French in the French and Indian Wars which resulted in 1763 with most French territory east of the Mississippi being ceded over to the British colonies at the Treaty of Paris (1763).  Book: History of the American Indians  In 1775, stimulated by the encouragement of a few intimate friends, such as Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, Colonel George Croghan, George Galphin, and Lachlan McGillivray, Adair determined to throw his notes into the form of a book. He mentions a string of disadvantages under which he laboured, notably the jealousy, secrecy, and closeness of the Indians, but hoped to be able to correct the very superficial notions that prevailed as to their civilisation. His book was called The History of the American Indians . . . containing an Account of their Origin, Language, Manners, . . . and other Particulars, sufficient to render it A Complete Indian System . . . with A New Map of the Country. The value of Adair's work as showing the relations between the Indians and the English traders was recognised, and a German translation appeared at Breslau in 1782. It must be admitted that a very disproportionate space is given to the hypothesis that the American Indians are descended from the lost ten tribes of Israel. Thomas Thorowgood, adopting an old idea of the Spanish Las Casas, had first maintained this theory in English in 1650 in his Jewes in America. Both Roger Williams and Jonathan Edwards seemed rather inclined to favour the view, which, as elaborately set forth by Adair, has since found champions in Elias Boudinot (Star in the West, 1816) and in Edward King, Viscount Kingsborough. Among the points of similarity between the Jews and Indians, Adair emphasised the division into tribes, worship of a great spirit, Jehovah, notions of a theocracy, of ablutions and uncleanness, cities of refuge, and practices as regards divorce and raising seed to a deceased brother. The bias imparted by this theory to many of Adair's remarks led Volney to condemn the whole book in his Tableau du Climat et du Sol des Etats-Unis. The second half of the book is more strictly An Account of the Katahba, Cheerake, Muskohge, Choktah, and Chikkasah Nations. Lord Kingsborough reprinted the whole of the first part of Adair's work in the eighth volume of his sumptuous Mexican Antiquities, with an appendix of notes and illustrations from inedited works by French and Spanish authors, 'affording the most satisfactory proofs of Adair's veracity in the minutest particulars.' Adair's map of the American Indian nations is partially reproduced in Winsor's History of America. References ;Attribution Sources Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896.

Though women were initially barred from combat, Major Marina Raskova used her position and personal contacts with the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Joseph Stalin, to obtain permission to form female combat units. On October 8, 1941, an order was issued to deploy three women's air-force units, including the 588th Regiment. The regiment, formed by Major Marina Raskova and led by Major Yevdokiya Bershanskaya, comprised primarily female volunteers in their late teens and early twenties. An attack technique of the night bombers involved idling the engine near the target and gliding to the bomb-release point, with only wind noise left to reveal their presence. German soldiers likened the sound to broomsticks and named the pilots \\"Night Witches\\". Due to the weight of the bombs and the low altitude of flight, the pilots did not carry parachutes until 1944. When the regiment deployed to the front line in June 1942, the 588th Night Bomber Regiment became part of the 4th Air Army of the Southern Front. In February 1943 the regiment was honored with the Guards designation and reorganized as the 46th Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment in the 325th Night Bomber Aviation Division, 4th Air Army, 2nd Belorussian Front; in October 1943 it became the 46th \\"Taman\\" Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, \\"Taman\\" referring to the unit's involvement in the Novorossiysk-Taman operations on the Taman Peninsula during 1943.  History and tactics  The regiment flew harassment and precision bombing missions against the German military from 1942 until the end of the war.\\" At its largest, it had 40 two-person crews. The regiment flew over 23,000 sorties, dropping over 3,000 tons of bombs and 26,000 incendiary shells. It was the most highly decorated female unit in the Soviet Air Force, with many pilots having flown over 800 missions by the end of the war, and twenty-three having been awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title. Thirty-two of its members died in the war. The regiment flew in wood-and-canvas Polikarpov U-2 biplanes, a 1928 design intended for use as training aircraft (hence its original uchebnyy designation prefix of \\"U-\\") and for crop dusting, which also had a special U-2LNB version for the sort of night harassment attack missions flown by the 588th, and to this day remains the most-produced wood-airframed biplane in aviation history. The plane could carry only two bombs at a time, so eight or more missions per night were often necessary. Although the aircraft was obsolete and slow, the pilots took advantage of its exceptional maneuverability; it also had a maximum speed that was lower than the stall speed of both the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, which made it very difficult for German pilots to shoot down, with the exception of fighter ace Josef Kociok, who grounded the regiment for an entire night by shooting down three or four of their planes on the night of 31 July 1 August 1943.  Cold welcoming  This all-female aviation regiment was not welcomed initially into the military with open arms. Many of their male counterparts saw them as inferior and treated them with lack of respect. The women of the regiment were also given hand-me-downs of uniforms and over-sized shoes by the men, as well as rudimentary tools (such as rulers, flashlights, pencils, etc) that lacked the \\"luxury\\" that the male soldiers received with their tools (e.g.- radar, guns, radios, etc.)  Timeline and operations  Members of the regiment were deployed from the Engels Military Aviation School to the Southern Front as part of the 218th Division of the 4th Air Army on 23 May 1942, where they arrived on 27 May. * 12 June 1942: The regiment's baptism by fire took place on the Southern front in bombings of river crossings on the Mius, Severny Donets, and Don rivers as well as roads in the Sal steppes and Stavropol suburbs. * August–December 1942: In the Battle of the Caucasus, the regiment defended the city of Vladikavkaz as well as bombing enemy equipment and troops in Digora, Mozdok, and Prokhladnaya. * January 1943: Assisted in the breakthrough of enemy defensive lines on the Terek River as well as offensive operations against ground troops in the Kuban River valley and Stavropol. * March – September 1943: Assisted in the breakthrough of the Kuban bridgehead and the liberation of Novorossiysk. * April – July 1943: Participated in the campaign of aerial warfare over Kuban. * November 1943 – May 1944: Provided air support to ground troops in the Kerch–Eltigen Operation as part of the Crimean Offensive and in the city of Sevastopol. * June–July 1944: Bombed enemy fortifications along the Pronya River, helping to take control of Białystok, Cherven, Minsk, and Mogilev in Byelorussia. * August 1944: Operations over Poland in campaigns to expel the Germans from the cities of Augustów, Warsaw, and Ostrołęka. * January 1945: Participated in the East Prussian Offensive. * March 1945: Participated in offensives over Gdynia and Gdansk. * April – May 1945: Assisted in the Vistula–Oder Offensive. * 15 October 1945: The regiment was disbanded following the end of the war and service members were demobilized.  Sorties  Throughout the course of the war the regiment accumulated approximately 23,672 sorties in combat, including in the following battles: * Battle of the Caucasus – 2,920 sorties * Kuban, Taman, Novorossiysk – 4,623 sorties * Crimean Offensive – 6,140 sorties * Belarus Offensive – 400 sorties * Poland Offensive – 5,421 sorties * German Offensive – 2,000 sorties In total the regiment collectively accumulated 28,676 flight hours, dropped over 3,000 tons of bombs and over 26,000 incendiary shells, damaging or completely destroying 17 river crossings, nine railways, two railway stations, 26 warehouses, 12 fuel depots, 176 armored cars, 86 firing points, and 11 searchlights. In addition to bombings, the unit performed 155 supply drops of food and ammunition to Soviet forces.  Personnel  Irina Sebrova flew 1,008 sorties in the war, more than any other member of the regiment. In total, 261 people served in the regiment, of whom 32 died of various causes including plane crashes, combat deaths and tuberculosis. 28 aircraft were written off.  Leadership  * Yevdokiya Bershanskaya – regiment commander * Serafima Amosova – deputy regiment commander * Yevdokiya Rachkevich – commissar * Maria Fortus and later Irina Rakobolskaya – chief of staff * Valentina Stupina and later Khiuaz Dospanova – head of communications  Repressed personnel  Senior Engineer Sofiya Ozerkova was sentenced to death by a military tribunal in 1942, but she was later acquitted after her sentence was suspended and she was reinstated to her position. Mechanics Raisa Kharitonova and Tamara Frolova were sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for dismantling a flare (used by navigators to illuminate bombing targets) and using the small silk parachute to sew undergarments. Both of them were retrained as navigators, but Frolova was killed in action in 1943.  Honored personnel  Twenty-three personnel from the regiment were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, two were awarded Hero of the Russian Federation, and one was awarded Hero of Kazakhstan.

The other two regiments were the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, which used Yak-1 fighters, and the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment, which used twin engine Pe-2 dive bombers. Later the unit received the Guards designation and reorganized as the 125th Guards Bomber AviationRegiment. Although all three regiments had been planned to have women exclusively, none remained all-female. The 586th and 588th Regiments employed male mechanics, the 586th because no women had received training to work on the Yakovlev fighter planes before the war. The 586th's woman commander, Major Tamara Aleksandrovna Kazarinova, was replaced by a man, Major Aleksandr Vasilievich Gridnev, in October 1942. The 587th Regiment was originally under the command of Marina Raskova, but after her death in 1943, a male commanding officer, Major Valentin Vasilievich Markov, replaced her. The 587th's Petlyakov Pe-2 dive bombers also required a tall person to operate the top rear machine gun, but not enough women recruited were tall enough, requiring some men to join the aircrews as radio operator and tail gunner. The 588th Regiment's staff driver and searchlight operatives were also male.  In media  A 1982 Soviet envelope commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the regiment.  Film and television depictions  * In 1974, the Soviet film Only Old Men Are Going to Battle featured two Night Witches as love interests of the main characters.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070861/ * In 1981, a Soviet feature- length film called ' () was directed by Yevgenia Zhigulenko, Hero of the Soviet Union, and one of the members of the regiment. * In 2001, a UK-Russian co-production starring Malcolm McDowell, Sophie Marceau and Anna Friel was due to be made, but failed to get backing from an American studio. * In 2013 two different productions were released. First came a short animation called The Night Witch commemorating Nadezhda Popova — who had died earlier that year — commissioned in collaboration with The New York Times Magazines The Lives They Lived issue, and directed by Alison Klayman. Secondly, a Russian TV series titled Night Swallows, very loosely based on 588 was produced and distributed.

They are the fourth generation of UltraSPARC microprocessors, and implement the 64-bit SPARC V9 instruction set architecture (ISA). The UltraSPARC IV was originally to be succeeded by the UltraSPARC V Millennium, which was canceled after the announcement of the Niagara, now UltraSPARC T1 microprocessor in early 2004. It was instead succeeded by the Fujitsu-designed SPARC64 VI. The UltraSPARC IV was developed as part of Sun's Throughput Computing initiative, which included the UltraSPARC V Millennium, Gemini and UltraSPARC T1 Niagara microprocessors. Of the four original designs in the initiative, two reached production: the UltraSPARC IV and the UltraSPARC T1. Whereas the Millennium and Niagara implemented block multithreading - also known as coarse-grained multithreading, the UltraSPARC IV implemented chip- multithreading (CMP) -- multiple single-thread cores. The UltraSPARC IV was the first multi-core SPARC processor, released in March, 2004. Internally, it implements two modified UltraSPARC III cores, and its physical packaging is identical to the UltraSPARC III with the exception of one pin. The UltraSPARC III cores were improved in a variety of ways. Instruction fetch, store bandwidth, and data prefetching were optimized. The floating-point adder implements additional hardware to handle more not a number (NaN) and underflow cases to avoid exceptions. Both cores share a L2 cache with a capacity of up to 16 MB but have their own L2 cache tags. The UltraSPARC IV contains 66 million transistors and measures 22.1 mm by 16.1 mm (356 mm2). It was fabricated by Texas Instruments in their 0.13 μm process. The UltraSPARC IV+, released in mid-2005, is also a dual-core design, featuring enhanced processor cores and an on-chip L2 cache. It is fabricated on a 90 nanometer manufacturing process. The initial speed of the UltraSPARC IV+ was 1.5 GHz, 0.3 GHz less than the intended 1.8 GHz. In April, 2007 it was increased to 2.1 GHz. It contains 295 million transistors. Servers using the UltraSPARC IV were released in September 2004. The UltraSPARC IV+ was released in Sun servers in September 2005. Sun Fire V490, V890, E2900, E4900, E6900, E20K and E25K systems all use UltraSPARC IV and IV+ processors. These systems range from 4 to 72 processor sockets (8 to 144 cores). Servers powered by the UltraSPARC IV+ processor were well received, allowing Sun to regain revenue lead in the RISC/UNIX server market in 2006.

The main offices are located in Cressona in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The forest is located on several small tracts in Carbon, Columbia, Dauphin, Northumberland, and Schuylkill counties. District #18 also includes Lebanon and Montour counties. History Shamokin Reservoir in Weiser State Forest Weiser State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system. Conrad WeiserThe forest is named for Conrad Weiser, an important Pennsylvanian in colonial days, especially known as an interpreter and emissary in councils between Native Americans and Pennsylvania. Prior to the July 1, 2005 realignment of Pennsylvania State Forest Districts, Weiser State Forest encompassed and District #18 included Carbon, Dauphin, Lebanon, Schuylkill, and the northern parts of Berks and Lehigh counties. After realignment, the state forest tracts in Columbia and Northumberland counties were added to Weiser State Forest, and Montour county became part of District #18 (they had previously been in Wyoming State Forest and District #20). Weiser State Forest and District #18 also lost territory as all of Berks and Lehigh counties became part of \\"Valley Forge State Forest\\" (renamed William Penn State Forest in August 2007) and District #17.

At a frat house mixer he gives her free Ecstasy. Later, they are together on her bed; doped and drunk, she falls asleep; he slightly lifts her clothes, but goes no further. On a date, they make out in his car. Meadow warns Jackie that their relationship is unlikely to go anywhere at the moment. On another evening, an over-excited Meadow takes Jackie's car and wrecks it. She is unharmed, but he is deeply concerned and she asks to spend the night with him instead of being driven home. In Dr. Melfi's waiting-room Tony finds another patient, Gloria Trillo, speaking on the phone. He hears that she works as a saleswoman at a Mercedes-Benz dealership. They have been double-booked and he gives her the appointment. Later, he visits the dealership and she accompanies him on a test drive. They end up in bed on Tony's boat. Gloria calls Melfi to cancel a session. Melfi hears a man's voice in the background. Ralphie is intentionally disrespectful to Tony when they meet. Each is thinking of killing the other. Johnny Sack passes messages between them, amending the messages to bring about a reconciliation. At Nuovo Vesuvio, Ralphie abjectly apologizes to Tony for all his past behavior, including his killing of Tracee, and blames his actions on his cocaine use. Tony barely acknowledges him. Johnny tells Ralphie that Tony was only \\"posturing.\\" He has suggested to Tony that he could promote Ralphie to capo in place of Gigi, but Tony is reluctant. Gigi soon dies of a heart attack on the toilet; Ralphie is the best choice to succeed him. He is relieved and joyous when Tony tells him of the promotion.

Structure It is an intermuscular cleft situated on the medial aspect of the middle third of the thigh on anterior compartment of thigh, and has the following boundaries: * Anteromedial wall - sartorius. * Posterior wall - adductor longus and adductor magnus. * Laterally - vastus medialis. It is covered in by a strong aponeurosis which extends from the vastus medialis, across the femoral vessels to the adductor longus and magnus. * Lying on the aponeurosis is the sartorius (tailor's) muscle. Contents The canal contains the subsartorial artery (superficial femoral artery), subsartorial vein (superficial femoral vein), and branches of the femoral nerve (specifically, the saphenous nerve, and the nerve to the vastus medialis). The femoral artery with its vein and the saphenous nerve enter this canal through the superior foramen. Then, the saphenous nerve and artery and vein of genus descendens exit through the anterior foramen, piercing the vastoadductor intermuscular septum. Finally, the femoral artery and vein exit via the inferior foramen (usually called the hiatus) through the inferior space between the oblique and medial heads of adductor magnus.

Life and career Rex George Reason Jr. was born in Berlin, Germany, to an American family that returned to Los Angeles shortly thereafter, where Rex was raised. He was the elder brother of actor Rhodes Reason. Rex Reason attended Herbert Hoover High School in Glendale, California and enlisted in the United States Army at the age of seventeen, serving from 1946 to 1948. He began his stage career in 1948 at the Pasadena Playhouse, performing there for three years before coming to the notice of Hollywood. In 1951 he was given a screen test at Columbia Pictures and was cast as the lead in a starring role in his first picture, a low-budget adventure drama Storm Over Tibet (1952) initially produced for MGM but acquired by Columbia Pictures. Reason was under contract for two more years at Columbia until moving to Universal-International in mid-1953, after making a promising appearance in the sword-and-sandal epic Salome (1953) with Rita Hayworth. A tall (6'3\\"), handsome, leading man with a distinctive baritone speaking voice, Reason appeared in several films and television shows throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He made two pictures at Universal Studios under the name \\"Bart Roberts\\" before demanding to be able to use his own name, which actually sounds like a Hollywood screen name. Reason is perhaps best known for his role as stalwart, heroic scientist Dr. Cal Meacham in the science fiction This Island Earth (1955). Reason co-starred as sympathetic scientist Dr. Tom Morgan in the third—and final—installment of Universal International Pictures' Creature from the Black Lagoon horror film series in The Creature Walks Among Us (1956). He also appeared opposite Clark Gable and Sidney Poitier in Band of Angels (1957) for Warner Bros. He appeared in Badlands of Montana (1957) as an opponent of a corrupt Mayor played by John M. Pickard. In the story line, Pickard administers ten lashes with a whip to Reason's back. Reason starred as newspapermen in two television series. The first of those was a syndicated western, Man Without a Gun (1957–1959), in the role of Adam MacLean, editor of the Yellowstone Sentinel newspaper in Dakota Territory. The second was the ABC/Warner Bros. drama, The Roaring Twenties (1960–1962), a crime drama in the role of Scott Norris, reporter for the fictitious New York Record. He appeared as a guest on an NBC interview program, Here's Hollywood in 1961, and guest-starred on a number of other television series. In Perry Mason he played the role of defendant Steve Brock in the episode, \\"The Case of the Ancient Romeo\\" (1962) opposite Jeff Morrow, who had starred with him in This Island Earth. His final television appearance was in an episode of Wagon Train broadcast in 1963. He was also featured in episodes of Bourbon Street Beat, 77 Sunset Strip, and The Alaskans. Reason walked out on his film contract with Warner Bros. in the fall of 1961 when he was being considered for a starring role in John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate (1962). The film began as a project at Warners, but was completed as an independent film and released by United Artists. Laurence Harvey was cast in the role instead. After his film and television acting career ended, he worked as a real estate broker and had a second career as a voiceover actor. During his later years, Reason was in retirement and living in Walnut, California, with his third wife, Shirley.www.rexreason.com- Official Website Death Reason died in Walnut, California from bladder cancer on November 19, 2015, eleven days short of his 87th birthday.'Actor Rex Reason has died' Newspaper Post, November 21, 2015.

He was part of a SS Sammelkommando that raided the plant genome material and seed collections of the Soviet Union. After the Second World War, he moved to South America and worked as a professor of botany in Argentina and other countries in South America. He served as an advisor to UNESCO on biology. Biography Brücher was born in Darmstadt and studied at Jena and Tübingen. By the time Brücher graduated in 1934 he was a member (number 3498152) of the National Socialist party. He obtained a doctorate at Tübingen where he studied the genetic differences in reciprocal crosses of Epilobium hirsutum under Ernst Lehmann and supported cytoplasmic inheritance which Lehmann did not believe in. Brücher turned against Lehmann later, and apart from scientific arguments, he also used Lehmann's supposed political views that were against the Nazi party to bolster his case. Brücher then joined to work as an assistant to the Nazi eugenicist Karl Astel at the Institute for Human Hereditary Research and Race Policy at the University of Jena. He also worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Plant Breeding Research and was keen on crop breeding which he saw as very important for national sustainability. When an expedition was mounted into the Soviet Union in 1941, Brücher then an Untersturmführer (Second Lieutenant) was interested in gathering crop seeds and plant material from the region including those held in Soviet research stations. The proposal was supported by SS Sturmbannführer (Major) Dr Ernst Schäfer and approved by Heinrich Himmler which led to the creation of the SS Sammelkommando or collection expedition which included Hauptsturmführer (Captain) Konrad von Rauch, and an interpreter Arnold Steinbrecher. The seeds and plant material collected by the expedition included large parts that had been deposited by Nikolai Vavilov who had already been imprisoned by Stalin. The seeds were maintained at Graz where the SS Institute for Plant Genetics were established at Lannach Castle. Brücher headed subsequent research and worked with a British prisoner of war, William Denton-Venables, a trained botanist who later served as a director of Taylor & Venables, a seed company in Norfolk. In February 1945 Brücher was ordered to destroy the Lannach facility to avoid its capture by advancing Soviet forces. He refused, and after the second world war Brücher moved to Sweden thanks to Sven Hedin's invitation and worked with Svalof seed company. During this period he married Ollie Berglund, a Swedish plant breeder. He then moved to Argentina which was then under Juan Perón and received there in 1948, a professorship in genetics and botany at University of Tucumán (Tucumán, Argentina). He later worked in Caracas (Venezuela), Asunción (Paraguay) and then in Mendoza and Buenos Aires (Argentina). He also worked in Pretoria in 1964-65 where he claimed to have evidence for white superiority. In 1972 he served as biology advisor to UNESCO. Brücher wrote a number of books and papers on the history of grain (1950), origin, evolution and domestication of tropical plants (1977) as well as the monograph Useful plants of neotropical origin and their wild relatives (1989). He wrote biographical papers on Ernst Haeckel and helped prop him up as an icon for Nazi science ideals. He was critical of Vavilov in his publications possibly because he saw Vavilov as a communist and there had been other German botanists like Elisabeth Schiemann (1881–1972) who had supported his theory while holding anti-Nazi positions. After moving to South America, Brücher focused on ethnobotanical research and worked on the wild relatives of potatoes and beans. A species, Solanum brucheri named after him by Donovan Stewart Correll was found later to be a hybrid of S. acaule Bitt. And S. infundibuliforme Philippi (Hawkes and Hjerting, 1969). Brücher's wife who worked at the University of Caracas and one of his two sons were killed in the late 1960s at roadside checkpoint in Venezuela by a guard, apparently by mistake. On 17 December 1991 he was killed on his farm Condor Huasi (or Condor house, though a picture of a motif at its entrance suggests a Nazi eagle) in the district Mendoza (Argentina). His murder was claimed to be the result of a burglary but the case was never closed and no arrests were made. According to Daniel Gade, an associate from the University of Vermont, Brücher, was a vocal opponent of alcohol and drugs. Brücher even used the word \\"hygiene\\" when referring to addictions in his publication, a term from Nazi times and personally avoided alcohol and meat. Gade suggests, based on evidence available, that Brücher was working on strains of Fusarium oxysporum to target the cocaine plant and destroy its cultivation, and suggested that drug lords may have found this as a possible motive for his murder. Unlike many other Nazi officers in South America, Brücher did not change his surname. He went by the local name of Don Enrique which was the Spanish form of his first name Heinz (and a cognate of Henry).

That is because Flint wrote 1632 as a stand-alone novel, though with enough \\"story hooks\\" for an eventual sequel, and because Flint feels \\"history is messy\\" and the books reflect that real life is not a smooth, polished linear narrative flow from the pen of some historian but is instead clumps of semi- related or unrelated happenings that somehow sum up how different people act in their own self-interests. Premise The series begins in the Modern era on May 31, 2000, during a small town wedding when the small West Virginia town of Grantville trades places in both time and geographic location with a nearly unpopulated countryside region within the Holy Roman Empire during the convulsions of the Thirty Years' War. Flint's goal was to explore the short- and long-term effects of placing a single American town, complete with modern culture, technology and modes of thought, in certain periods of history. The town elects the charismatic former pro-boxer Mike Stearns as president, and he quickly decides to provide refuge for those displaced as a result of the constant fighting, to branch out and grow as quickly as possible—to launch the American Revolution \\"150 years early\\", and found a \\"New United States\\". The Grantvillers undertake to defend south central Thuringia with the aid of a cavalry detachment from king Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden's Green Regiment, and fights several battles which convince various polities to join the NUS. By early 1632, their informal alliance with Gustavus and with Jews, their manufacturing capabilities, and their defeats of Catholic armies draws serious and well-designed concerted efforts to attack the \\"republican cancer\\" growing in Thuringia, and Grantville itself is attacked, teaching Stearns that he needs a protector to \\"buy time\\", even as the \\"up-timers\\" have determined that to retain as much technology as possible they need to \\"gear down\\" to a late nineteenth-century technology base while their modern equipment is still operable. Plot summary 1633 continues where 1632 left off. Most of the novel details various political machinations of the new \\"United States\\" and the attempts of Cardinal Richelieu to nullify the threat posed by the technological advantage the up-timers have given to Gustavus Adolphus and his \\"Confederated Principalities of Europe\\". Richelieu completely changes France's foreign policy and forms an alliance aimed squarely at the NUS and Gustavus called the League of Ostend. Mike Stearns sends emissaries looking for allies, some of whom end up behind enemy lines as they already belong to the secret League of Ostend, which announces its presence in the Battle of Four Fleets. The Dutch Republic nearly falls and Stearns' emissary voluntarily stays behind, becoming trapped in the Siege of Amsterdam. At this point, the newly created timeline start to diverge greatly from the actual history of the 17th Century, in no small part because the news of a town from the future brought spies and emissaries, and a fair number of encyclopedias and history textbooks found their way into European courts. One theme of the series is of down-timer leaders trying to change, hasten or head off their histories while the acts of ordinary citizens going about their day-to-day affairs and of the leaders of Grantville effect more fundamental societal and political changes. A mix of methodology In the series the major novels carry the majority of internationally significant events, but the characters who perform the action are all too likely to have been introduced in one of the ground-eye view short stories which build deep background and form a backdrop for the overarching story lines. Flint is on record of stating \\"history is messy\\" but is not the stuff of the linear narrative cleaned up, categorized and written into a history book—and that he wanted to capture some sense of how individual actions on the behalf of one's own self-interest actually form the essence of history, not some idealized superman controlling the throttle and steering wheel at the heart of changing events. To a great extent, the short stories are fundamental to the main novels in the series, introducing characters and development which play again later in the longer works. Much of writing in Ring of Fire (ROF) antedated this work, and events in this novel were correlated with the stories in that which in many cases, cover events and personalities referenced in this at the least, moreover, there is not a single story in the anthology which happens after the start of this book, they all take place ahead of its exposition. One ROF story, \\"In the Navy\\", by Weber is a direct prequel to a main plot element in this book and its plot threads' direct sequel 1634: The Baltic War. Characters in \\"1633\\" List of 1632 characters (fictional) Reception Publishers Weekly gives a positive review and praised the authors, Flint \\"for at showing how the new converts can make even the 'old Americans' uncomfortable in their zeal to achieve the blessings of 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,'\\" while Weber \\"helps smooth out characters who were stereotypes in the first book.\\" Booklist gave a mostly positive review saying that \\"if it takes too many pages for some, others will turn every one and cry for more, which the authors intend to provide.\\" Alternate Link via EBSCO (institutional library access).

History of Saint Dunstan's Parish The Florence Henry Memorial Chapel in The Highlands, Shoreline, Washington, on a foggy day in the Fall. Formation of congregation Regular services began for what was to become Saint Dunstan's in the Florience Henry Memorial Chapel in The Highlands gated community in 1949. The congregation grew rapidly and was officially organized in 1951 as a mission of the Diocese of Olympia. Technically, a mission is a developing congregation, led by a vicar appointed by the Bishop and not necessarily self- sufficient. During its mission years, the congregation took the title \\"The Highlands Congregation.\\" Growth and change from a mission congregation to parish status Rapid growth led to the acquisition of the property at 722 North 145th Street and the construction of the present building in 1959-1960. This building was originally called \\"Saint Dunstan's Hall.\\" When the congregation was incorporated in March 1962 becoming a parish of the diocese, the legal title \\"St. Dunstan's Church of the Highlands Parish\\" was selected, a reference to its origins and to the fact that at that time, at least 40% of the members still attended services in the Henry Chapel.

Spokan Garry brought an Anglican form of Christianity to the Middle Spokanes after attending a school ran by the Church Missionary Society of the Anglican Church at Fort Garry (Winnipeg), Manitoba. Later in life Spokan Gary became the central speaker for the Spokane, Coeur d'Alene, and Colville nations when negotiating with territorial Governor Isaac I. Stevens. In these dealings, Spokan Garry wanted peace, not war. Celtic cross before it was mounted over the porch Dudley Carter became the first King County Parks and Recreation artist in residence when he was 96 years old. There are numerous works by Carter in the metropolitan Seattle area, particularly in Bellevue and Redmond. His home at 7747 159th Place Northeast, Redmond, has become an historic site and park (\\"Haida House Studio\\"). In addition to his Seattle area carvings, Carter has \\"The Ram\\" and \\"Goddess of the Forest\\" at the City College of San Francisco. Celtic cross over porch The artist, Lycia Danielle Trounton, created a Celtic cross design to bring out these aspects of Dunstan's life: (1) musician, (2) illustrator or illuminator of manuscripts, and (3) metalworker, blacksmith or farrier (a person who shoes horses). Then, these ideas were complemented with a central image of the Holy Spirit as a dove. The picture of the cross before mounting shows the imagery used clearly. The knot-work spans the length of the cross. Celtic knot-work is timeless and is generally considered the interconnectedness of, and eternal quality of, all life. The Celtic cross was a form which would normally be encountered in an outdoor setting in stone, as in a traditional church burial yard in Ireland. Some of the textual and patina qualities in bronze were developed to evoke this feeling. The cross was mounted over the front entry porch. Parish Logo Logo for Saint Dunstan's Church of the Highlands Parish, Shoreline, Washington The logo used by Saint Dunstan's Parish was designed for the 1000th anniversary of Dunstan, and distributed to parishes bearing his name. The four quadrants emphasize four aspects of Dunstan's life: * Top left corner: Pallium. This vestment is shown in the coat of arms of the Archbishop of Canterbury. * Top right corner: Chalice. This is used on the altar for wine for the Holy Eucharist. * Lower left corner: Crosier. This is used by bishops as a symbol of their office. * Lower right corner: Tongs. This tool is used by metalworkers. Parish Organ The pipe organ at St. Dunstan's Church began life as a 2-manual, 18-rank, instrument built by the Boston firm of Hutchings- Votey Organ Co. as their Opus 1642 in 1902 for Temple de Hirsch in Seattle, Washington. When that congregation built a new edifice in 1960, the Seattle firm of Balcom and Vaughan was selected to move, rebuild, and reinstall the organ as their Ous 680.. A new console and new Kilgen-style electro-pneumatic windchests were built. The Hutchings-Votey windchests were used in a Balcom and Vaughan project in Tacoma, Washington. The disposition of the Hutchings- Votey console is not known. The transplanted organ was 17 ranks. In the 1970s, Temple de Hirsch elected to replace the pipe organ with an electronic Allen organ. St. Dunstan's then purchased the used Hutchings-Votey / Balcom and Vaughan and reinstalled it in the church with the Great division exposed on two electro-mechanical windchests on the front wall, and the original 1960 Balcom and Vaughan Kilgen-style chests in the Swell division in chambers behind the Great. Tonal changes were made with the existing pipework. The organ continues to serve the parish with a few minor tonal changes.

He is best known for founding the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary which later merged with the Congregation of the Holy Spirit (Spiritans). He is often referred to as \\"The Second Founder of the Spiritans\\". He was declared venerable in the Roman Catholic Church on 1 June 1876, by Pope Pius IX. Early life Jacob Libermann was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Saverne, Alsace, France in 1802. As a young man, Libermann prepared to follow in the footsteps of his father, the Chief Rabbi of Saverne.\\"The Story of Francis Libermann\\", Francis Libermann Catholic School, Toronto He would later relate how he lost his faith in Judaism after entering a yeshiva. Treated with disdain by two of the professors there, he began to read French literature, especially Rousseau, with the result that he became an agnostic. Later during this period of agnosticism, another rabbinical student gave him a Hebrew translation of the Gospels. Being always a very moral person, Libermann was captivated by the high moral tone of Jesus' discourses, though he could not accept the supernatural elements in the Gospels. Then, however, he received three blows to his agnosticism when two of his brothers, to whom he was very attached, and an old friend and former fellow student, Knight Drach, converted to Roman Catholicism. He, too, began to find himself drawn toward the Catholic Church. After arriving in Paris, where his father had sent him to pursue his studies, he made his decision and Jacob Libermann was baptized on 24 December 1826, taking the name François Marie Paul. He entered the Saint-Sulpice seminary in Paris in the same year to study for the priesthood. The knowledge of his conversion was long concealed from his father, who was horrified to learn of his favorite son's actions. When the news of his baptism reached Saverne, his father mourned him as dead. François Libermann, 19th century. Klosters Knechtsteden, Dormagen, Germany. Priest and missionary Libermann suffered from epileptic seizures, which prevented his ordination for nearly fifteen years. It was only when these seizures ceased in 1841 that he was able to become a priest. After his ordination, Libermann created the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary centered around missionary activity towards newly freed slaves in Réunion, Haiti, and Mauritius. As this group attracted more members, the Holy See merged his society with the older Congregation of the Holy Spirit, otherwise known as \\"Spiritans\\". Due to this event, Libermann is often referred to as the \\"Second Founder\\" of the Spiritans. Although, Fr. Libermann himself never went overseas, he recruited and educated missionaries going to Africa, both lay and clerical. He exhausted himself in the process of leading his great enterprise, and died on 2 February 1852 before his 50th birthday.\\"Francis Libermann\\", Spiritans, USA Legacy Logo for Francis Libermann Catholic High School, Ontario, Canada. He was declared venerable by Pope Pius IX in 1876. His letters, hundreds of which survive, are frequently used as a guide in the devotional life. Fr. Libermann was a pioneer of strategies now recognized as a blueprint for modern missionary activity. He urged the Spiritans to \\"become one with the people\\" so that each group received and understood the Gospel in the context of their own traditions.

The treatment used the then-new drug L-DOPA. In 1982, Sacks wrote: The book inspired the 1982 play A Kind of Alaska by Harold Pinter, performed as part of a trilogy of Pinter's plays titled Other Places, and a documentary television episode, the pilot of the British television programme Discovery.

He distinguished himself in the Second Anglo- Maratha War, serving with the 78th Highlanders in India. His commander, General Wellesley (later Duke of Wellington), thanked him for his services on several occasions. After the 1811 invasion of Java, he was appointed to a command in the army, and also as minister at the court of the emperor or Susuhunan Pakubuwono IV. Family Alexander Adams was born into an ancient landed Pembrokeshire family in Holyland, Pembrokeshire, the son of Major Joseph Adams and Elizabeth (née Campbell) Adams. Military service Gibraltar Adams originally joined the Queen's Royals as an ensign, and served in that regiment as a lieutenant and adjutant, or acting adjutant, for a considerable time, chiefly at Gibraltar, a period he remembered with much pleasure. India He joined the 78th Highlanders, not long after its formation, with the rank of captain. Around 1796, he was the paymaster of the regiment in Bengal. He trained the men using David Dundas's then little-known drill-book of 1788 as a guide and is credited with instilling a high degree of discipline. He was promoted to major and given command of the regiment at Fort William, Bengal, in 1801. During the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803, the 78th was sent via Bombay to Poona to join a division of the Madras Army commanded by Major-General Arthur Wellesley (later Duke of Wellington). Wellesley, by an extraordinary march, had saved the city from destruction. Adams distinguished himself at the successful escalade of the Pettah of Ahmednagar. During the heat of the action, the 78th, on the extreme left of the line and somewhat separated from it, had to charge a double column of regular infantry and artillery, while keeping a large body of cavalry in check on the left and, at the same time, being fired upon from the rear by their own guns. The 78th's guns, left behind by the necessity of closing quickly with the enemy, had been seized and turned against them by a party that had passed through the gap between the 78th and the rest of the brigade, along with some stragglers. Once the 78th had captured the enemy guns to its front, General Wellesley rode up and instructed Lieutenant-Colonel Adams to \\"face about, and drive those fellows from our guns\\", which was immediately done. In his next general action, Adams was engaged against the combined armies of Scindiah and the Rajah of Berar at Argaum on 29 November later the same year. Here he took command of the leading brigade, owing to the illness of the unit's brigadier, who soon after died. The enemy troops were drawn up in an extended line, flanked by masses of cavalry, on a gently sloping plain. They permitted the British column to advance parallel to their front to within a very short distance without opposition. Having concentrated the greater number of their guns to bear upon one point of the road in front of a mud-walled village, the enemy suddenly opened fire on the leading battalions of sepoys, causing them to give way. General Wellesley, riding up to ascertain the situation, gave his directions, which were implemented by Adams, to lead the column round by the other side of the village. The natives were rallied behind this shelter, formed a line, and charged. Several hundred of the devoted sect of Gossains advanced to meet them, discharged their firearms, and attacked with swords the 78th and the remains of the 74th Regiment (which had suffered severely in the former action), but were wiped out. The British were soon in possession of the field, artillery, baggage, and all. After this achievement, Wellesley expressed his appreciation of Adams's conduct. Adams also participated in the subsequent siege and storming of the strong hill-fort of Gawilghur. The Second Anglo-Maratha War ended immediately afterward. A strong detachment, consisting of the 78th along with a proportion of natives and artillery under the command of Adams, was sent to reduce the hill-fort of Lhoghur, whose governor proved hostile. Upon learning of preparations being made to storm the place, however, the governor became alarmed and surrendered. Wellesley once again thanked Adams, this time for the judiciousness of his preparations and his negotiations for the surrender, the fort being considered almost impregnable. About the middle of 1804, the 78th went into cantonments at Bombay, where it remained until 1806, when it was sent to Goa. Adams was nominated to the command of the British auxiliary force at that Portuguese settlement under very delicate circumstances, during the French occupation of Portugal. At one time, the British force was ordered to be prepared to take possession of the colony if necessary. In 1811, the 78th Regiment was ordered to Madras to augment the force which Sir Samuel Auchmuty, the Commander-in-Chief of the Madras Presidency, was about to lead to Java. Java Adams was appointed to the command of a brigade. The Java Expedition sailed the day before a tremendous hurricane which devastated the Coromandel coast. The expedition, which was well out to sea, suffered only trifling damage. Reinforced at Malacca by a body of troops from Bengal, the army disembarked near Batavia, took possession of it, and made preparations to attack the strongly fortified position of Cornelis, within three or four miles of that city. After a heavy cannonade from both sides for some days, it was taken by assault, resulting, after some subsequent minor operations, in the final surrender of the island and its dependencies. On the settlement of Java, Adams was appointed to the command of the central division of the army, and to the important office of minister at the court of the emperor at Solo. He held this office until it was merged in the appointment of a civil commissioner to superintend the affairs of the native courts. Adams was then nominated Resident at Sourabaya, and to the command of the troops of the eastern division. The latter position, he continued to exercise at Sourabaya and at Samarang, until the general peace and restitution of Java to the Dutch. Retirement Having attained the rank of major-general, he returned to Europe and retired to his paternal estate near Pembroke. In 1830, he was promoted to lieutenant-general. He died on 12 September 1835 in a shooting accident in the vicinity of Pembroke. While in the act of getting over a hedge, his fowling-piece, although at half-cock, went off; the contents entered his left eye and blew off the entire side of his head, killing him instantly. He had married Frances-Louisa Holcombe, daughter of the Reverend William Holcombe, in 1801. She survived him.

He attained fame and made a remarkable career centred in France which also included films, during the 1950s and the 1960s. He became famous with his 1961 song Brigitte Bardot. Biography Darío Moreno was born to a large Jewish family. He was orphaned in early childhood when his father, who worked in a train station in Aydın, was shot dead under tragic circumstances. He was placed in the Sephardic orphanage of Izmir (Nido De Guerfanos\\"Nido de Guerfanos para kriaturas sin padre o madre\\" ) by his mother and remained there until he was four. After a primary education in the Jewish educational establishments of Izmir, he had many odd jobs during his early youth. He put great effort into continuing his education while simultaneously working to make a living. He started working as an errand boy in the law firm of the city's prominent lawyers, and he was eventually trained to become a clerk in the office. In the evenings, he would study French in Izmir's Central Library. With a guitar that had fallen into his hands by chance, he also learned to play the guitar, mainly on his own with occasional tutoring from acquaintances. He started singing at Bar Mitzva celebrations as a second job. In his early twenties, he had already become a well-known singer in Izmir, and particularly among the Jewish community. During his military service in the Turkish Army, he was employed as a singer in officers' quarters in various garrisons and became more focused on music. His first truly professional musical performance started in his hometown right after his discharge, and was arranged through connections established while in the army. When he started making money with his music, he moved to the better-off Jewish quarter of Karataş to a house in a street leading to the historical building of Asansör, one of the city's landmarks (and which literally means the \\"Elevator\\", people taking an actual elevator to go to the higher part of the quarter, this part being separated by the coastal strait with a steep slope). Nowadays this street is named Dario Moreno Sokağı (Dario Moreno Street) in his legacy. A hyperactive personality, Darío Moreno died of a heart attack resulting from a discussion between him and an airport gate staff in the Atatürk Airport. He was slightly late for one of his flights, on his way to Paris for a concert. He was also planning to attend the first \\"Turkish Night\\" planned to take place in Paris. The airport gate staff discretionary did not allow him to board the plane and this led to a serious debate which resulted in Moreno's heart attack. https://www.biyografya.com/biyografi/14612 He was only 47. According to his will he wanted to be buried in İzmir, Turkey, but he was buried in Holon, Israel, by his mother Madam Roza.Akşam Gazetesi: Batı müziğini ülkemize getiren Moreno anıldı Ya Mustafa Ya Mustafa is one of the most remembered of Moreno's songs. It was very famous in the 1950s and early 1960s. The original version of this catchy song and the identity of its composer are disputed. It appeared in one of the films of the Egyptian actor Ismail Yassin in the 1950s and in another Egyptian film of Sabah from the same era. Dario Moreno performed it in the late 1950s. In Europe, the song became popular with the help of Bob Azzam (a Lebanese singer who was born in Egypt in 1925 and died in Monte Carlo 2004), who released it in 1960 in France with lyrics consisting of at least 3 languages: \\"Chérie je t'aime, chéri je t'adore – come la salsa del pomodoro\\" (Darling, I love you, darling, I adore you – like tomato sauce). Bruno Gigliotti, (Orlando) the brother of famous singer Dalida, also covered the song. This song, with its polyglotic lyrics, can be considered a historical documentation of the cosmopolitan era in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. During that era, a large cosmopolitan polyglotic community, mainly Turks, Greeks, Jews, Armenians and Italians, lived in the Egyptian city. A sizable portion lived in the Attareen district, where the events of the song take place.

He was a leading figure in the early European electrical industry.  Early life  Rathenau was born in Berlin, into a wealthy Jewish merchant family based on Viktoriastrasse by the Tiergarten, an old Jewish quarter of the city. His father Moritz Rathenau, was a grain trader who had moved to Berlin to set up business. His mother, Therese, was the daughter of Josef Liebermann, another businessman attracted to the growing opportunities of the burgeoning Prussian capital. Emil was particularly close to his mother, whom he regularly visited until her death in 1894. His parents families had met through the (Society of Friends), a cultural organisation played a central role amongst the prominent members . Emil undertook an apprenticeship in Silesia, working for a company owned by the Liebermann family. After four and half unhappy years he received a large inheritance following the death his grandfather, Josef Liebermann. This enabled him to gain a technical training in Hanover and Zurich, and then an appointment as a technical adviser for Borsig, a Berlin-based manufacturer for the railway sector. However he did not remain there long, and spent some time in England expanding his experience. Upon his return to Berlin, in 1866 he married , daughter of the Frankfurt banker Isaak Nachmann (1816–1870). Also in 1865 he joined an old school friend in taking over a small machine building factory in Berlin. Business career In 1865, Rathenau was a partner in a factory, during which time (while traveling abroad) he recognized the possibilities of the then newly emerging electrical technology. The dramatic victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War was ensued by a collapse, prompting Rathenau to sell up in 1873. A Grand Tour of Central and Eastern Europe took him to Vienna Science Exhibition, Philadelphia, and Paris. In 1881, he attended the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris and saw Thomas Alva Edison's invention of the light bulb for the first time. Realizing the potential of electricity, he acquired the rights to manufacture products based on Edison's patents with the help of a bank group. By 1907 AEG had become the largest commercial company in the world. The bank advised him to partner with his competitor Werner von Siemens. Since both were followers of the idea of monopoly they signed a contract of trust (monopoly) where Siemens was producing and selling generators and Rathenau built power stations and laid cables. In 1883 he founded the \\"German Edison Corporation for Applied Electricity\\" (Deutsche Edison-Gesellschaft für angewandte Elektrizität), which in 1887 changed into the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (General Electricity Incorporated) abbreviated AEG. On 19 February 1884 Rathenau and the magistrate of Berlin signed an agreement on the electrification of the city. While he financed the deal, Rathenau's private company was also permitted to use public streets to lay electricity lines. The city received 10% of the income for giving its authorization. Peter Becker, a German energy expert has called this Germany's first private-public partnership and after the first power station went online to illuminate the 'Gendarmenmarkt' at night. The Berlin model became influential throughout the German Empire. In 1903, Rathenau was appointed general manager of AEG. Together with his competitor and business partner, they formed the Telefunken Gesellschaft für drahtlose Telegraphie mbH. He held numerous positions on the supervisory board of Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft und der Elektrizitäts AG vorm. W. Lahmeyer & Co. One of his sons was Walther Rathenau, an industrialist, politician, and progressive economist who served as German Foreign Minister during the Weimar Republic.

Lorenzo Sousa Debarbieri is the chairman of the board of directors of the company. Routes PeruRail's routes are divided into two sections; there are no tracks through Cusco. The line between Cusco and Machu Picchu - Ferrocarril Santa Ana - is a narrow gauge line, which boasts a series of five switchbacks called locally 'El Zig-Zag', which enable the train to climb up the steep incline out of Cusco, before it can begin its descent to the Sacred Valley of the Incas and then continue down to Machu Picchu. However, this section of the route (between Cusco San Pedro station and Poroy) - which had been suspended - resumed by IncaRail from May 2019. Other trains to Machu Picchu leave from Poroy, just outside Cusco, instead. From Poroy, the narrow-gauge line goes northwest to Ollantaytambo, where the branch from Urubamba joins, then on to Machu Picchu station in Aguas Calientes. Tracks formerly continued into the jungle, but they were destroyed by recent flooding. Motor car of Perurail clearing the track ahead of a regular passenger train from Cusco to Puno. The network, formerly Ferrocarril del Sur, starts at Matarani port, goes through Arequipa and enters Puno Region, where the line splits in two at Juliaca. The eastern branch goes to Puno; the western branch runs into Cusco. At its highest point, La Raya Pass (), the altitude is . The train makes a stop in La Raya pass where there is an exquisite view over all the plains to the snowcapped mountains, and a beautiful old chapel, standing all alone in the middle of the Andean plateau. There's no more passenger traffic between Arequipa and Matarani, and it was also suspended on the Juliaca - Arequipa line for several years until May 2017 when the Belmond Andean Explorer was inaugurated.

Cusco - Puno (Lake Titicaca) - Arequipa  PeruRail train from Cuzco to Lake Titicaca stops at La Raya pass MLW DL560D 653 with a tourist train Puno - Cusco The luxury sleeper train, Belmond Andean Explorer is operated from Cusco for a one-night journey to Puno, and a two-night three- day journey to Arequipa. Its carriages were formerly used on the Great South Pacific Express in Australia between 1999 and 2003, and brought to Peru in February 2016.Great train mystery solved as luxury carriages ship out Queensland Times 25 February 2016 Until the inauguration of this service in May 2017, the name was featured by a first-class service day train, which was renamed to Titicaca Train. It has Pullman-style dining cars and an open-air observation bar car similar to Hiram Bingham. This service provides a 10-hour trip from Cusco to Puno. The interiors of its vehicles were designed by James Park & Associates, the same company who designed the elegant first-class cabins for Singapore Airlines. The actual work, however, was done in Cusco by Cusquenian workers. After the refurbishment was completed, a traditional Andean ceremony, 'Pago a la Tierra' (payment to Mother Earth), was organised to 'bless' the train. A local shaman presided over the ceremony, which involved many traditional rites.  Local trains  Although not advertised, PeruRail also offers local trains equipped with wooden seats and that are available only to Peruvian nationals for a fraction of the price charged to tourists.

Peruvian rail transport has never formed a true network, primarily comprising separate lines running inland from the coast and built according to freight need rather than passenger need. Many Peruvian railroad lines owe their origins to contracts granted to United States entrepreneurs Henry Meiggs and W. R. Grace and Company but the mountainous nature of Peru made expansion slow and much of the surviving mileage is of twentieth-century origin. It was also challenging to operate, especially in the age of the steam locomotive. In the latter part of the 1880s, the principal public railways, the Central and Southern, with others, passed to the control of the Peruvian Corporation, registered in London and controlled by Americans Michael and William R. Grace. In 1972 they were nationalized as Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles del Perú (ENAFER), but this survived as an operator only until 1999 when most surviving lines were privatized. Regular passenger traffic now operates over only a small proportion of the mileage. The Tacna-Arica line crosses the boundary with Chile, running twice daily, once in the morning and once in the late afternoon. The Southern Railway provides connection with Bolivia by ship across Lake Titicaca. Principal lines Lima - Morococha - Abra Anticona (Ticlio) - La Oroya - Huancayo passenger line The Central Railway, Ferrocarril Central del Perú (FCC), incorporates the first railway in Peru opened on May 17, 1851 linking the Pacific port of Callao and the capital Lima ( of standard gauge). This was expanded to form the Callao, Lima & Oroya Railway, opened to Chicla by 1878, the original contractor being Henry Meiggs and engineer being Ernest Malinowski assisted by Edward Jan Habich. The line reached La Oroya by 1893 and Huancayo () in 1908. It is the second highest railway in the world (following opening of the Qingzang railway in Tibet), with the Galera summit tunnel under Mount Meiggs at and Galera station at above sea level, requiring constructional feats including many switchbacks and steel bridges. Since 1999 it has been operated as the Ferrocarril Central Andino (FCCA) (with its associated maintenance company Ferrovias Central Andina (FVCA)) by the Pittsburgh-registered Railroad Development Corporation. There is no regular passenger traffic but excursions are operated from the Lima Desamparados station. In April 1955 the Central Railway opened a spur line from La Cima on the Morococha branch ( above sea level) to Volcán Mine, reaching an (at the time) world record altitude of . Both branch and spur have since closed to traffic. Contemporary Railcar manufactured by EIKON International with final destination to the Cusco - Machu Picchu line \\\\- Retrieved 2010-10-28 The Central is extended by the Ferrocarril Huancayo - Huancavelica which was authorised in 1904 (engineer: Charles Weber) but work was interrupted during the World War I and it was not opened throughout ( of gauge) until 1926. Work was continued but never completed on extending the line to the Pacific coast. After a period under provincial government control it was agreed in June 2006 by the Peruvian government that FCCA should go ahead with converting the line to (as had in fact been intended prior to 1919). Estimated to take 16 months, the US$33m project was to be funded jointly by the government and the Development Bank of Latin America.Great South American Rail Adventure Also connecting with the Central, at La Oroya, is the Cerro de Pasco railway opened in standard gauge form in 1904 to serve ore mining in the Cerro de Pasco district. It was thoroughly North American in all its operations and, although primarily a mineral line, did run a passenger operation, latterly known as the “Flamingo” from the consist purchased from the Florida East Coast Railway. The owning company was nationalised as Centromín in 1974 and operation of the railway was taken over by FCCA. of gauge was completed of a Tambo del Sol- Pachitea line intended eventually to extend to the head of Amazon navigation on the Ucayali River at Pucallpa; this aspiration was abandoned by the government in 1957. The Southern Railway, Ferrocarriles del Sur del Perú (FCS), another Meiggs concession, was completed from Arequipa to Puno in 1876 and to the coast at Matarani. The railway also operated steamers (including the Yavari) and train ferries on Lake Titicaca connecting with Guaqui in Bolivia. Although work on the Juliaca–Cuzco section was begun in 1872 it was not completed through until 1908. The summit of this section is reached at La Raya ( above sea level). Since 1999 it has been operated by PeruRail, an affiliate of the Belmond Ltd. group, whose tourist trains form the only passenger services. From Cuzco, the gauge Ferrocarril Santa Ana (Ferrocarril Cuzco á Santa Ana) (engineer: Mauro Valderrama) was authorised in 1907, originally at gauge, but the first section was not opened until the early 1920s. It was extended to Aguas Calientes () in 1928, passing to government control in 1931. Although further extended in stages through to Quillabamba (reached in 1978), landslides (attributed to effects of El Niño) caused it to be abandoned beyond Hidroelectrica in 1998. It is now operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail, and forms the only means of access for visitors to Machu Picchu. At the beginning of 2010 it was cut by landslides. The isolated Ferrocarril Tacna á Arica was completed in 1856. Following the War of the Pacific it and the surrounding territory passed to Chile; after a settlement in 1929 the Tacna end of the line was returned to Peru while the port of Arica remained in Chilean hands. The British concession for the line reverted to the Peruvian government during World War II. The line remained open for both passengers and freight for several decades, with a museum collection at Tacna station. The line closed in May 2012; in June 2014 the Peruvian government sought bids for redeveloping the line. Finally, in 2016 the line was reopened, offering two services daily. Tren de la Costa A regional rail line, referred to as Tren de la Costa is planned, paralleling the Pan American Highway between the cities of Sullana and Ica, via Lima. Other lines The newest railway in Peru is a standard gauge line opened in 1959 by the Southern Peru Copper Corporation from its opencast mine at Toquepala to the port of Ilo () with a later branch largely in tunnel to its workings at Cuajone. There were a number of other lines, all now closed, mostly for mineral or agricultural traffic, running inland from the coast north of Lima and in Pisco Province. There were also lines serving nitrate deposits in the Tarapacá Region, ceded to Chile in 1883. Some railway exhibits, including a working gauge pleasure line, are to be seen in the Parque de la Amistad in the Surco district of Lima.

Bass viol (Ashmolean Museum) Violin (Esther 1917) F-hole label on Viola. Church of San Giuseppe in Brescia. Gasparo da Salò (May 20, 1542 - April 14, 1609) is the name given to Gasparo Bertolotti, one of the earliest violin makers and an expert double bass player. Around 80 of his instruments are known to have survived to the present day: violins (small and large), alto and tenor violas, viols, violones and double basses, violas designed with only a pair of corners, and ceteras. Career Gasparo da Salò was born in 1542 in Salò on Lake Garda, in a family with legal, artistic, musical and craft interests. His grandfather Santino, a land and flock owner who it is believed likely produced musical gut strings, moved from Polpenazze to Salò, capital of the Riviera del Garda, possibly in search of the greater opportunities then available in Salò, whose music scene was very rich and vibrant. Gasparo da Salò was the son and nephew of two accomplished musicians, Francesco and Agostino, who were violin players and composers of the highest professional level, distinguished enough to be referred to in surviving documents as the \\"violì” or \\"violini.\\"Documents are reproduced in A. M. Mucchi, \\"Gasparo da Salò\\", 1940 In addition to being an expert in musical instruments,Catalog \\"Gasparo da Salò architetto del suono\\", pg. 16 da Salò's uncle Agostino was the first Kapellmeister of Salò and his son Bernardino, Gasparo da Salò's cousin, was a virtuoso musician (violinist and trombonist), who worked in Ferrara at the Este music court, and then in Mantua for Vincenzo I Gonzaga, during which time he was a contemporary of Monteverdi, and finally in Rome as \\"Musician of His Holiness the Pope in the Castle of S. Angel.\\" Gasparo da Salò's musical education took place during a period of growing refinement and professionalism among the musicians and violin players of Salò and Brescia, many of whom played in the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice, as well as many other musically distinguished European courts from the early 1540s onward. His deep education in musical performance, undertaken by his noted musical family, is evidenced in a document found in Bergamo concerning music in San Maria Maggiore dated 1604, in which Gasparo is cited as a very talented violone player. When his father died, around 1562, da Salò moved to Brescia. It appears da Salò immediately rented a house and set up shop in the neighborhood hub of musical life, the Contrada Antegnati, known for the presence of a very famous dynasty of organ builders, and other skilled multi- instrumentalists, who were granted a professional patent by the Brescia City Council in 1528, the first known example of such in Europe. These instrument makers were located in the Second Quadra St. John, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio del Podestà (now Via Cairoli). From his ability almost immediately to rent a house with a shop in this sought-after neighborhood, and considering the unlikelihood of a substantial inheritance, as well as the conspicuously large family of brothers and sisters whom he helped to support financially, we can surmise that da Salò was enjoying some measure of success in the family's traditional string making trade. His business was successful enough to allow him to marry Isabetta Cassetti, the daughter of an artisan potter and glassmaker three years later. During this time Gasparo da Salò cultivated a deep relationship with Girolamo Virchi, one of the most prominent artist- craftsmen of the city, cited in a 1563 document as \\"maestro de musica instrumentis.\\" In 1565 Virchi became godfather to da Salò's child Francesco, the first of seven children, including three sons named Marcantonio, two of whom died in infancy, and three daughters. In addition, in that neighborhood there lived two organists of Brescia Cathedral, Fiorenzo Mascara and his successor Costanzo Antegnati, and a noted violin player, Giuseppe Biagini. Like many other Brescian virtuosi multi-instrumentalists (who typically played multiple aerophones, various string instruments, and beginning from the middle of the century the new viola da braccio or violin), Mascara was an excellent viola da gamba player. This direct knowledge of, and friendship with, Virchi and Antegnati's work opened up new artistic horizons resulting in notable improvements to the sound and design of strings and stringed instruments. An Appraisal of the Policy of 1568 (a tax return) testifies to a flourishing business, which continued to grow significantly. In 1575 he bought a house in the Cossere district, his historic headquarters, and subsequently manufactured many instruments. His workshop quickly became one of the most important in Europe in the second half of the 16th century for the production of every type of stringed instrument of the time. Gasparo da Salò developed the art of violin and string making to a very high level, and passed on this tradition to five known students: his eldest son Francisco, Alexandro de Marsiliis from Marseille, France, Giovanni Paolo Maggini from Botticino in the surroundings of Brescia, Jacomo de Lafranchini from Valle Camonica, and a maker known only as Battista. Exports reached Rome, Venice and France. Gasparo da Salò's instruments were probably exported to France by Abramo Tieffenbrucker, See Gasparo da Salò's instruments were probably exported to France by Abramo Tieffenbrucker, as is indicated by the Policy of 1588, wherein some exports to France are documented (probably in particular of the model called by Monteverdi \\"violin piccoli alla francese\\" or \\"little violins in the French style\\"), as well as other surviving documents. It is also known that da Salò bought strings and precious woods for his art from Rome and Venice around this time. Income from the business enabled him to acquire extensive landholdings in the territory of Calvagese, with adjoining manor houses and farmhouses. Gasparo da Salò is known to have provided substantial assistance to his sister Ludovica, and acted as guardian to the three sons of his wife's brother, Rocco Cassetti, presumed dead, along with his own wife, in the plague of 1577. He died April 14, 1609. The short but significant death act survives and reads: \\"Messer Gasparo Bertolotti maestro di violini is dead & buried in Santo Joseffo\\". The exact location where his remains lie among the graves of the Brescian musical pantheon, in company with Antegnati Costanzo, Don Cesare Bolognini and Benedetto Marcello, is not known; however it is considered likely that they repose in the common grave of the carpenter's guild. Artistic life It is debatable whether Gasparo da Salò or others like Gasparo Duiffopruggar or Andrea Amati were the first to produce the violin in its modern form; certainly Gasparo developed an instrument of modern character, with very quick response and a powerful tone. It is believed that the mystery of the large increase in power and projection of violas da braccio and violins of the time, sought and developed by luthiers like da Salò, is explained by the necessity of being heard while playing in mixed ensembles alongside cornettos and trombones in open air places like St. Mark Square in Venice during processions. It appears Gasparo da Salò's patterns were later studied by Stradivari between 1690 and 1700 for the violin type referred to as the \\"Long Strad,\\" one of the master's most distinguished and desirable models. There is reason to believe that Brescian instruments were in fact the most popular and sought after throughout Europe in the Renaissance period, as they were more requested in high musical courts than Cremonese ones until 1630, when the plague killed the best known Brescian masters, after which time Cremona started to become the center of the violin maker's trade. Although the Brescian masters did not survive the plague, their prolific and accomplished output of instruments certainly did, as a letter from Fulgencio Micanzio to Galileo Galilei dated 1636 makes clear: \\"the instruments from Brescia are easy to buy...\\" and another document states \\"because you can find [them] on every corner...\\". Many Brescian stringed instruments are listed in inventories of musical instrument makers or instrument dealers in Europe, such as the list published by Francoise Lesure in 1954, wherein the following catalogue of instruments is recorded: 63 lutes from Padua, 17 from Venice, 24 violins from Brescia, 15 lots of strings of Firenze, 21 of Siena. It is also notable that the word \\"violino\\" appears in Brescian archival documents at least as early as 1530 and not in Cremona until some fifty years later. Quite a few of the Brescian violins were wonderfully decorated and many were superbly finished, while others retain some rough features of finishing, yet almost all of the authenticated surviving examples by da Salò, his workshop, or of his school or pupils, are noted for their beauty of tone and powerful projection. Gasparo da Salò himself built many violins that conform to the measurements of the modern violin, in an era when the precise measurements of the violin family of instruments were not yet standardized, as well as a small number of models built on a smaller pattern (probably \\"alla francese\\"). In addition to violins, he built violas of different sizes from small (39 cm = 15.4\\") to very large (44.5 cm = 17.5\\"), both alto and tenor, sometimes with only two corners, as well as cellos, violones, and probably lyres and lironi. In surviving documents, Gasparo da Salò is referred to as “maestro di violini\\" (violin master) as early as 1568. This title was given to violin makers and was clearly distinct in contemporary documents from the title of \\"sonadore de violini\\" (violin player). The title of maestro di violini appears to have been in use from at least 1558 in Brescia and is first attributed to the master luthiers Guglielmo Frigiadi and Francesco Inverardi years prior to the arrival of Gasparo da Salò who at that time still lived in Salò. We know comparatively little of da Salò's chief rival for the distinction of having created the first modern violin, Andrea Amati, lacking as we do the wealth of documentary evidence referencing Amati's violin making that we have for Gasparo da Salò. Eleven documents are known to exist referencing Amati, compared with slightly less than a hundred for da Salò. Of the eleven, only one document clearly mentions the work of Amati, and it is comparatively late, dating from 1576, eight years after the document referenced above, and it states simply: \\"l'arte sua è de far strumenti da sonar” (\\"his art is of making instruments to play\\"). Conspicuously absent is any mention of the acclaimed Amati violin, which seems to have been manufactured from the early 1560s, apparently with great success. From 1581 and until 1588, the various written references to Gasparo da Salò as a master violin maker are further augmented with various Latin titles such as \\"artefici (or artifex) instrumentorum musicorum” (maker of musical instruments) and the Italian title “artefice d'istrumenti musici” (maker of musical instruments) and “instrumenti de musicha” (Instruments of music) in order to emphasize his mastery of the construction of all kinds of instruments. In 1585, he resumed use of the old tradition title of \\"master of violins,\\" which would continue to be his specialty from 1591 until his death, with the exception of a brief period in February and March 1597 wherein he is referred to as \\"magister a citharis,\\" the citharis being a special and sought after instrument also known as the cetra or cetera. An archival document from 1588, a surviving tax record, clearly indicates the export of Gasparo da Salò's work to France. About eighty of Gasparo da Salò's instruments are known to have survived to the present day, and they stand confidently among the works of Stradivarius, Guarnerius, Amati, Jacob Stainer, and his own pupil Giovanni Paolo Maggini as unique examples of the highest mastery attained in Brescian or indeed European instrument manufacture of the golden era of violin making, possessing exceptional tonal characteristics. Owing to their exceptional tone and beauty, Gasparo da Salò's patterns are frequently emulated in exacting modern commercial reproductions. These modern tributes to Gasparo da Salò are themselves merely the latest arrivals in what has become a long and distinguished tradition of copying and emulating the master's work. Charles Beare's analysis of the best works of Guarneri del Gesu's latest period, including the famous Vieuxtemps Guarneri of 1741, seems to demonstrate that Guarneri very strictly copied the arching used by Gasparo, which helped develop an instrument of modern character, with very powerful tone and projection.Catalogue of the international exhibition on Giovanni Paolo Maggini held in Brescia in 2007 Virtuosi have also long recognized the exceptional qualities of da Salò's violins, violas, and double basses. In 1842, the Norwegian virtuoso Ole Bull was willed an unplayed, richly-decorated da Salò violin originally made in 1562. Benvenuto Cellini carved the scroll of this spectacular instrument, which is on permanent display as a part of the exhibition \\"People and Possessions\\" at Vestlandske Kunstindustrimuesum in Bergen. One of his finest instruments, a double bass with a rapidity of response similar to that of a violin (owned by the 18th - 19th century virtuoso Domenico Dragonetti), is preserved today in the Basilica of San Marco in Venice. A second, exceptionally rare bass, possibly the only surviving example of a classical violone contrabasso with a six-hole peg box, was discovered by the Roman master luthier and restorer Luigi Ottaviani in the stores of the Museum of Musical Instruments in Rome, where it is now displayed. A third double bass is preserved in storage beneath the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Canada as part of a collection donated by R. S. Williams. And a fourth was acquired by the Salodian family Biondo from M° Leonardo Colonna, for one of the double bass players of Teatro alla Scala of Milan, and is now on display in a room of the City Council Palace in Salò. This bass is used in many of the concerts of the annual Gasparo da Salò Summer Festival concert series. In addition, one of Gasparo da Salò's violins is prominently displayed at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague. Because of their scarcity, only five instruments made by Gasparo da Salò are known to have been auctioned since 1893. Most recently, Christie's auctioned a violin in 1980 and a viola in 2010 for $542,500. Violists who play da Salò's instruments include Gérard Caussé, James Dunham, Amihai Grosz, and Cynthia Phelps.

Usually, one line is the main line and carries traffic through the junction at normal speed, while the other track is a branch line that carries traffic through the junction at reduced speed. A number of configurations are possible.  At grade   Diamond  right A schematic diagram of a dual gauge diamond crossing Diamond crossings in Nagpur, India The simplest and oldest arrangement consists of two turnouts and a fixed Diamond crossing. Because the diamond needs to be relatively coarse, say 1 in 8, the curve radius is necessarily small, leading to a speed of perhaps . This type of junction is common on street-running tramways, where speeds are quite low and junction must fit into the available road space. Because the points are close together, the entire junction can be controlled by the mechanical point rodding of a single signal box. Signal passed at danger (SPAD) protection — A train from R to P with 12 points reverse is protected from a train from P doing a SPAD by 11 points also lying reverse. A train from P to Q is NOT protected from a train from R doing a SPAD.  Switched diamond  right The fixed diamond can be replaced with a switched diamond, which eliminates the gap in rails at the K-crossing, which allows a higher speed if the geometry is poor. However, switched diamonds are not a perfect solution to the K-crossing problem, as the switches are very coarse compared to the finer switches of a turnout, and require high maintenance. The additional ends are also awkward to control unless power operated point machines are used.  Ladder  left An improved junction replaces the diamond with turnouts, which can be of as fine an angle as possible, so that this junction can carry branch traffic at high speed. This configuration assumes power operation of the points, as high speed turnouts are generally not suitable for mechanical operation. The high speed turnouts may require more than one point machine each. The turnouts can have no superelevation while the curve in the branch can; therefore the radius in the turnouts must be greater than the radius of the curve in the branch. Since the ladder type junction requires much more length, diamond type junctions can only be converted into ladder types if there is room and no bridges, tunnels, or platforms in the way. ;SPAD protection Essentially the same as for a double junction with diamond. Examples include Harris Park railway station, Sydney.  Single lead Left Hand  A single lead junction is used where traffic density is lower, and moves one of the turnouts on the main line onto the branch. This reduces the number of turnouts on the main line that are subject to wear. Space permitting, a single lead junction may be a stage towards construction of a higher speed ladder junction. This is shown as blue dashed line on the diagram.  Risk  However, unlike in the ladder, branch trains in opposite directions can collide head-on at 32 if either one passes a signal at danger (SPAD). This has contributed to fatal accidents, e.g. in the UK at: Glasgow Bellgrove on 6 March 1989 and Newton on 21 July 1991.Hall, Chapter 6: Hidden Dangers - Single Lead Junctions These risks can be reduced by trap points, ATP or TPWS.  Wear and Tear  The diamond crossing is a high wearing and undesirable component: * gaps in the K-crossings, and V-crossing. * vibration at gaps caused by wheels jumping over these gaps. * small parts which allow the joins to bend. * insulated block joints, if needed for Track circuits, create more joints to bend. * inconvenience when trying to tamp the track. * inconvenience of speed limits to reduce vibration. * difficulty of obtaining \\"track possession\\" to allow maintenance to be carried out. * often the existing tracks do not have space to allow the alternative to be built as an afterthought. * when starting on a \\"green field\\" site, the opportunity to install two high speed turnouts to replace each diamond should not be missed. * the insulated block joint problem can reduced if axle counters can replace the track circuits over the crossings. * switched diamond only suitable a limited range of crossing angles, and they have their own problems. ** say 1:5 (too coarse) to 1:10 (too coarse). * the tracks through diamonds needed to be co-planar, and if not poor geometry and poor speeds may result. * the legs of the diamond should be straight if possible. * Trains (magazine) devoted an issue to diamonds, which, in their opinion, are NOT a railroad's best friend ** where traffic over a diamond crossing is heavier in one direction than the other, special measures can be taken to improve performance in the heavier traffic direction. See Trains.  Single lead Right Hand  A right hand single lead junction cannot protect against a collision should the Q-P train overrun the signal protecting the junction, and this is not ameliorated by reverting to a double junction.  Diamond and wide centres  right A double junction with a diamond can have its speed limit raised if the track centres are widened from say 4 m to say 12 m to allow for a fixed coarse-angled diamond crossing (say 1 in 8.25) with fine- angled turnouts (1 in 15). If the legs of the coarse crossing X are straight and flat, then this arrangement eliminates the need for switched diamonds and their inconvenient moving parts. ;SPAD protection Essentially the same as for a double junction with diamond.  Scissors crossovers   Fast Speed  The Channel Tunnel has at its entrances a scissors crossover implemented with two turnouts replacing the usual diamond crossing in the middle. This is only possible because of the wide track centres caused by the wide spacing of the entrances to the tunnel. The result is high speeds on the turnout routes through those turnouts and minimum wear and tear. All the turnouts, P, Q, R, S, X1 and X2 are all the same high speed. Track centres need to be at least twice the normal track centres as if there was a hidden track in between. All the turnouts are identical except for handedness. right  Medium Speed  Were this junction be made with a Diamond crossing in the middle, speeds through the turnout would be much reduced, and wear and tear on the diamond would be high. right  Very slow Speed  At Hornsby the site is very constrained and speeds through the diamond crossing was only 8km/h, increased to 15km/h after a few changes. The site does not permit any further increase, and the restrictions dating from 1890 remain. Track centres are 12' (3.66m) throughout. Colour coding is as follows: * Black - unchanged * Red - scissors crossovers * Blue - roads and road overbridges * Purple - other rail tracks. Speed limits * on the straight through the scissors crossovers are 40km/h. * on the curves through the diamond crossing \\"X\\" are now 15km/h. * on the curves from S - P2 and P1 to P are 40km/h. right  Grade separated   Flyovers  right left A double junction can be grade separated so that there is no flat crossing, reducing conflicts and reducing congestion. Flyovers require a lot of space both lengthwise and crosswise, and cannot always be built. Flying junction example at Aynho Junction. Diving junctions such as at Chatswood are a variant. Weaver Junction is the oldest flying junction in the United Kingdom and perhaps the world. See also Aynho Junction. ;SPAD protection Because the diamond crossing or equivalent is eliminated, one of the potential SPAD hazards is also eliminated, leaving just the merging junction hazard.

Kadambini, herself, was also the first Indian as well as South Asian female physician, trained in western medicine, to graduate in South Asia.  Early life  The daughter of Brahmo reformer Braja Kishore Basu, she was born on 18 July 1861 at Bhagalpur, Bihar in British India. The family was from Chandsi, in Barisal which is now in Bangladesh. Her father was headmaster of Bhagalpur School. He and Abhay Charan Mallick started the movement for women's emancipation at Bhagalpur, establishing the women's organisation Bhagalpur Mahila Samiti in 1863, the first in India. Kadambini started her education at Banga Mahila Vidyalaya and while at Bethune School (established by Bethune) in 1878 became the first woman to pass the University of Calcutta entrance examination. It was partly in recognition of her efforts that Bethune College first introduced FA (First Arts), and then graduation courses in 1883. She and Chandramukhi Basu became the first graduates from Bethune College, and in the process became the first female graduates in the country and in the entire British Empire.Female students were admitted into Oxford University in 1879, one year after the admission of female students for undergraduate studies at the University of Calcutta . The tripos was opened to women at Cambridge only in 1881 . Kadambini joined the medical college in 1883 despite strong criticism from the society opposing women liberation. In 1886, she was awarded GBMC and became the first woman physician with a Western medical degree in the whole of South Asia. In 1893, she travelled to Edinburgh and qualified as LRCP (Edinburgh), LRCS (Glasgow) and GFPS (Dublin).  Personal life  As the mother of eight children, she had to devote considerable time to her household affairs. She was deft in needlework. The noted American historian David Kopf has written, \\"Ganguli's wife, Kadambini, was appropriately enough the most accomplished and liberated Brahmo woman of her time. From all accounts, their relationship was most unusual in being founded on mutual love, sensitivity and intelligence… Mrs. Ganguli's case was hardly typical even among the more emancipated Brahmo and Christian women in contemporary Bengali society. Her ability to rise above circumstances and to realize her potential as a human being made her a prize attraction to Sadharan Brahmos dedicated ideologically to the liberation of Bengal's women.\\" She was heavily criticised by the then conservative society opposing women liberation. After returning to India and campaigning for women's rights ceaselessly, she was indirectly called a 'whore' in the magazine 'Bangabashi', but that could not deter her determination. Her husband, Dwarkanath Ganguly, took the case up to the court and eventually won with a jail sentence of 6 months meted out to the editor Mahesh Pal.

It may result from severe eye disease, inflammation or injury, or it may represent a complication of eye surgery. Treatment options include insertion of a prosthesis, which may be preceded by enucleation of the eye.  Symptoms  The affected eye is shrunken, and has little to no vision. The intraocular pressure in the affected eye is very low or nonexistent. The layers in the eye may be fused together, thickened, or edematous. The eyelids may be glued shut. The eye may be soft when palpated. Under a microscope there may be deposits of calcium or bone, and the cornea is often affected by cataracts.  Causes  It can be caused by injury, including burns to the eye, or long-term eye disease or inflammation. End-stage glaucoma can cause it. It can often complicate eye surgery. Other common causes include cancer, retinal detachment, vascular lesions, infection, and inflammation.  Treatment  Treatment for the affected eye is often futile. Usually, treatment is to end the pain in the affected eye and for cosmetic purposes, not to restore vision. It can be removed, a procedure called enucleation of the eye.

Constructed in 1966, the A-31 primarily links Joliette with the A-40 and in turn to Montreal, Trois-Rivières, and other points served by Quebec's autoroute system. The A-31 is only long, making it one of the shortest autoroutes in the province. It is multiplexed with Route 131 for its entire length. The A-31 also carries the name Autoroute Antonio-Barrette, named for a politician from Joliette who briefly served as Premier of Quebec in 1960. Route description The A-31 begins just south of its interchange with A-40 in Lavaltrie. Motorists exiting the A-40 can opt to travel north on A-31 (multiplexed with Route 131) or south on Route 131 to Lavaltrie's city centre. The A-31/A-40 interchange has an unusual configuration, built to accommodate tollbooths (since dismantled). Also unusual for a Quebec autoroute: agricultural vehicles like tractors are permitted to cross over the A-40 by travelling on A-31 from its southern terminus to exit 2. For this reason, an automated traffic regulation system (commissioned in 2009) lowers the speed limit automatically from 100/60 km/h to 90/30 km/h as needed. Exits at km 2 and km 7 provide access to local roads, while a partial interchange at km 12 serves an industrial zone south of Joliette. The A-31 ends at km 15 at a cloverleaf interchange with Route 158. Plans for Quebec's autoroute system initially called for A-31 to meet the A-50 at this interchange. Anticipating this outcome, Route 158 in the immediate vicinity of the interchange was constructed as a limited-access highway and signed as A-50. Once plans to extend the A-50 east of the A-15 were abandoned in the 1980s, this stretch of highway was redesignated Route 158. A series of deadly accidents on Route 158 prompted a 2014 petition drive to reconstruct the highway to Autoroute standards and return the designation of A-50. Motorists exiting the A-31 at km 15 may continue on Route 158 west to St-Esprit, Route 158 east to Berthierville, or Route 131 north to Saint-Félix-de-Valois. Past this interchange, A-31 ends and becomes Boulevard Dollard, which continues into downtown Joliette.

The publishers of the novel are Boston: Lee and Shepard, New York: Charles T. Dillingham. The majority of the novel purports to be a translation of an ancient scroll diary written by a woman named Seola, who is identified as the wife of Japheth. The Book of Genesis indicates that Noah had three sons named Ham, Shem and Japheth. In the appendix section of the novel, Ann Smith describes how she was inspired to write the fantasy. She writes: > \\"Seola is a fantasy, revealed to the writer while listening to the > performance of an extraordinary musical composition. It was sudden and > unforeseen as the landscape which sometimes appears to a benighted > traveller, for one instant only, illumined by the lightning's flash.A book > review publisher called, \\"Good Company-Sunday Afternoon: A magazine for the > household\\" released an article on the novel Seola in 1878.

The appendix and notes section at the end of the novel Seola explain certain passages within the story and how they are supported by real ancient texts. Portions of the story can be perceived as extrapolations from the Haggada, the Mahabharata, The Book of Enoch and the creation myths of Greek mythology. Plot The greatest discovery of the nineteenth century is found by accident. A team of archaeologists uncover one of the most ancient burial tombs of all time. Inside the tomb they find something far greater than gold or gems, they find a diary of a person who lived more than four thousand years ago. The team pool all their knowledge together in order to translate the scroll diary before it disintegrates in the foreign air. The diary of Seola is about a girl's struggle to resist a wicked world. Her resolve to remain loyal to God is so strong she influences a fallen angel to repentance. The diary is unique because it gives a detailed account on how the Great Deluge started. One of the planets in the solar system becomes unstable and its destruction causes the waters above the expanse to fall. The beginning entry of the journal gave no doubt as to the era the individual claims to come from. The entry reads, “West Bank of the Euphrates, first moon-evening, after Adam, four cycles”. The author of the journal identifies herself as Seola, daughter of Aleemon and Lebuda. Her father was the son of Lamech and his father was Methuselah. Aleemon had a passion for study and the preservation of historical records. This desire kept him near a grand city which contained a wealth of knowledge on the history of the world written down on scrolls. The city’s name was Sippara and it was also known as the city of the Sun. This desire also endangered the lives of his family. It so happened that the city was the royal seat of the one who ruled the planet. This ruler was known as Lucifer the Light Bearer, King of the Sun. He and his kind were ruling the earth for over 1100 years, since the days of Jared. These beings were known as the Devas. The Devas were angelic spirit beings that materialized into human form. Their superior powers enabled them to dominate and instill fear into the human race. They sought after the most beautiful women of mankind and took them as wives. Through the union of the mortal female and the angelic being came male children of large stature. These offspring were known as the Darvands. The Darvands were ruthless bullies with strength that none could match. Seola begins her journal at the request of her father. Her first entries are common and uneventful because the family has been relocated to an isolated section of the forest away from Sippara and their life is peaceful with the isolation. The tranquility eventually comes to an end because the Devas discover their private sanctuary. The threat to the family is neither by wealth or possession but by way of beauty. Derivative works In 1924, an anonymous author published a revision of Seola under the title Angels and Women Most names and places in the book were changed. In Angels and Women, Seola and Lucifer are named Aloma and Satanas, and the city of Sippara is called Balonia. The Golden Age Journal (now Awake magazine, published by Jehovah's Witnesses via the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania) of July 30, 1924, p. 702, recommended that its readers purchase a copy of Angels and Women: In 1977, in his Secrets of the Lost Races, Rene Noorbergen claims that in 1950, a certain \\"Dr. Philip Gooch\\" gave information about an ancient diary written on a scroll which told of the events leading up to the deluge to Aaron J. Smith, leader of the Oriental Archaeological Research Expedition to the supposed location of Noah's Ark on top of Mount Ararat. Gooch supposedly wrote: \\"The diary was written by Noah's daughter-in-law. The author of the Journal called herself Amoela and she claims to have been a student of Methuselah. He taught her about the history that transpired from the creation of Adam to the deluge. Her youngest son Javan placed the completed scroll diary in his mother's tomb after she died in the 547th year of her life. The diary was placed in a crystal quartz case, with tempered gold hinges and clasps. The crystal case was then found by a high ranking Mason in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The original and the translation of the diary were stored in an unknown Masonic Lodge.\\" It is apparent that these details were derived by some means from either Seola or Angels and Women. An original first edition of Seola has sold for more than $3000 US Dollars on ebay.com. A first edition version of the 1924 Angels and Women has sold for more than $400 US Dollars on the addall.com book search website.

It was founded by Georg Wertheim and operated various stores in Berlin, one in Rostock, one in Stralsund (where it had been founded), and one in Breslau. The Wertheim store on Leipziger Platz in Berlin, seen after 1926. Founding & Early Years In 1875, Georg's parents, Ida and Abraham Wertheim (who sometimes went by the name Adolf), had opened a modest shop selling clothes and manufactured goods in Stralsund, a provincial town on the Baltic Sea. An extensive network of family members ensured a low-priced supply of goods. In 1876, one year after the shop opened, the two eldest sons Hugo and Georg (aged 20 and 19 respectively), went to work in the shop following their apprenticeships in Berlin. Three younger sons later joined them. Expansion & Growth The two brothers quickly brought new ideas into the shop: customers were allowed to replace goods, the price of a good was no longer debatable but reliable, and purchases were made strictly with cash. This concept was successful, and after the opening of another branch in Rostock, the first branch in Berlin (Rosenthaler Straße) was founded in 1885. Wertheim quickly realised the changing demand of the growing city in the period of industrialisation and in 1890 opened the first real department store on Moritzplatz/Oranienstraße in Berlin-Kreuzberg. The shop floor was more generous in size and permitted more elaborate presentation of products for sale, products were put on display, and longer runs allowed lower prices. However, it increasingly appeared that the limitations, which arose due to the shops' locations within an older-style structures with rooms that were not especially large and this made further expansion difficult. A store was established in Leipzigerstrasse in 1892, and in 1894 began the sale of goods in the first purpose planned and built department store on the Oranienstraße. The flagship Wertheim store on the Leipziger Platz opened in 1896 and attracted an upmarket clientele, who until then had held back from patronising his department stores, with all their needs satisfied under one roof. In the following years, Messel had to constantly expand the building. Other stores on Rosenthaler Straße (1903), Königsstraße (1911) and, again, on Moritzplatz (1913) were rebuilt or expanded. The Moritzplatz Wertheim store helped to finance the redirecting of the U-Bahn (Underground) (copying the model of his competitor Rudolph Karstadt) in order that customers could go directly from the underground platform to the entrance. Leipziger Platz Store The chain's most famous store, on Leipziger Platz in Berlin, was the biggest department store in Europe at the time, and was one of the three largest department stores (Warenhäuser) in Berlin, the others being Hermann Tietz and Kaufhaus des Westens. This store was constructed between 1896 and 1906 by the renowned architect Alfred Messel who also designed other stores for the firm, such as that at Rosenthaler Straße 27–31/Sophienstraße 12–15 (partially surviving) which was built between 1903-1906. At its full extent the building covered 26,000 square metres and faced both the Leipzigerstraße and the Voßstraße and stretched nearly all the way from the Leipziger Platz to the Wilhelmstraße. During construction the night-time electric lighting and steel scaffolding caused a sensation, and when the store opened on 15 November 15 1897, the result was traffic chaos on the Leipzigerstraße. The innovative, vertically structured facade of narrow pillars extending from the ground floor to the roof and interspersed with windows received high praise, not least because it alluded to the building's function. After passing through a vestibule two-storeys high, one entered a rectangular light well 22 meters high and 450 square meters in size. On the opposite wall an imposing stairway led to the upper sales floors. On the landing was a 6-meter-high (20 ft) statue symbolizing “Labor” by Ludwig Manzel, and the wall above was decorated with monumental frescoes showing an ancient harbor by Max Koch and a modern harbor by Fritz Gehrke. It featured 83 elevators and two glass-roofed atriums. With the construction of the corner pavilion on the Leipziger Platz frontage, with its deep portico, in 1904, Messel created nothing less than the incunabulum of progressive department store architecture. The traditional formal language, with the quasi-ecclesiastical sculpture employed, was described by critics as a \\"positive catastrophe\\", contrasting with the much- derided Berliner Dom (Cathedral), which was completed around the same time. The portico's sculptures, featuring figures from the Old Testament and Greek Mythology were the work of Josef Rauch (1868-1921). Fritz Stahl made the comment that the Leipzigerplatz portico was the \\"first building of the time to restore sculpture to its true architectonic relationship\\". The tremendous impact of the new department store on the general public as well as on architecture experts is documented in newspaper and magazine articles and statements by famous architects and their critics. These included Peter Behrens, Henry van de Velde, August Endell, Bruno Taut, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Hermann Muthesius, Karl Scheffler, Walter Curt Behrendt, Fritz Stahl, Alfred Lichtwark, Heinrich Schliepmann amongst others. Brian Ladd called it “the crown jewel of the main shopping street.\\"http://www.policyreview.org/apr01/matus.html The store did not survive World War II. In March 1943 it was damaged by three exploding bombs, and its final destruction was caused by a fire started by a phosphorus bomb. The ruins were cleared away in 1955–56 to make way for a border strip demarcating the Russian sector of Berlin. The larger atrium of the Wertheim store on Leipziger Platz, c. 1900. The Nazi Period The company was subjected to the Nazi Aryanization policies in the 1930s. Jewish employees were forced from their positions by government mandate. The Wertheim family attempted to avoid losing control of the company by making Georg's wife, Ursula, the principal shareholder, since she was considered \\"Aryan\\" under Nazi law. In the end this was unsuccessful, even though they divorced to keep the shares in purely \\"Aryan\\" hands. The family was forced to sell all their shares at reduced prices to \\"Aryans\\" and in 1939 the store was renamed AWAG, an acronym for Allgemeine Warenhandelsgesellschaft A.G. (General Retailing Corporation).

The station also aims to provide a mix of entertainment, information, news and training opportunities that reflects the community's needs and interests. History The original idea of establishing a community radio station was formulated in 1975 by Vince Murray, Warwick Madden, Kent & Dorothy Broadhead. After a proposal paper was written, a steering committee was set up. The first public meeting was held at the Burwood Public Library on 15 October 1975 where office-bearers were elected. It was found that there was no provision in the then Broadcasting and Television Act for the issuing of community broadcasting licences. The members of 2RDJ-FM Community Radio set about lobbying the Federal Government to prove the necessity and practical benefits of public broadcasting. But they met with no success. During this period the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia was founded. The CBAA brought all aspiring public broadcasting groups under the one umbrella, in the process creating a lobby group that had greater influence. Between 1975 and 1982 2RDJ-FM carried out a number of test transmissions. The first studios were two that were already established within the home of Kent & Dorothy Broadhead at 6 Riverview Street Cabarita (Sydney) NSW. The first test transmission involved the volunteer members of the radio station themselves assembling and erecting an FM mast in the back yard. In 1980 the station moved into a new home in the Woodstock Community Centre in Burwood. In 1982 the then Minister for Communications Ian Sinclair toured the Burwood area during election campaigning. The Mayor of Burwood, Alderman Phillip Taylor invited Mr Sinclair on a tour of the Woodstock Centre, which included an inspection of the 2RDJ-FM studios. Mr Sinclair was informed about the plight of aspirant public broadcasters being unable to apply for a full- time broadcast licence. A few months later a notice appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald calling for applications for nine C Class Public Broadcasting Licences in the Sydney metropolitan area. Following a public hearing on 5 September 1982 the then Australian Broadcasting Tribunal granted a licence to 2RDJ-FM to serve the Inner West suburbs of Sydney. During the following fourteen months a 100-foot mast was erected adjacent to the Woodstock building and the studios and equipment were upgraded. After many test runs, 2RDJ-FM went to air at 7:00am on 5 November 1983. Current Radio 2RDJ broadcasts around 80 hours a week of locally produced programs, supplemented by content from the CBAA National Program stream. The station has two studios, each fully capable of live-to-air stereo broadcasts. Broadcast power is currently 100 watts ERP with the entire station, transmitter, and antenna mast co-located in the Woodstock Building, Burwood. The station also delivers its programs via the internet 24/7 on www.radio2rdj.com.au. The station is funded mainly through sponsorship contributions, member subscriptions, and occasional grants and donations. Radio 2RDJ normally operates four or five outside broadcasts (OBs) each year, in support of (Sydney) Inner West community events such as fairs, local Council festivals, and carnivals. Special programs produced live at these OBs replace normal weekend programming. 2RDJ is proud to have several highly popular voices among its presenter line-up including June Donovan, John Elwell, Stephanie (Breakfast), John Dale, Gil Onyett, Neil Lithgow, as well as the ethnic presenters including the Ireland Calling crew led by Catherine Crosse, Cathy Brazil, and Tina King-Garde, Programming The station's current programs cover diverse music styles from jazz, classic pop and rock, ethnic music, dance, and show music. All music programs aim for at least 30% Australian content (except ethnic shows). Most programs feature community news and some contain interviews. A few programs are broadcast by specialist interest groups or in languages other than English. Weekday programs are 'bookended' by a Breakfast show (7-9 am) and a popular Drive show (5-7 pm).

History Chalet in Pöschenried Lenk is first mentioned in 1370 as An der Leng. The oldest traces of a settlement in the area come from neolithic artifacts that have been found scattered around the municipality. During the Bronze Age Burgbühl and Bürstehubel were both fortified. Under the Romans the area was on along a major North-South road that passed over the Rawil and Kaltwasser Passes. They built a way station and a small shrine at the Iffigsee and a road and lime kiln at Iffigenalp. By the Middle Ages the Bronze Age fortifications were reoccupied and the area was split between the Herrschaft of Mannenberg and the estates of the Freiherr von Raron. The lands passed through several owners and by 1502 Bern ruled over the lands of the modern municipality. The municipality split from the neighboring St. Stephan in 1504-1505. In 1522 it achieved its sovereignty in the canton of Bern. The village church was built in 1505. The church became a parish church in 1513. In 1528, the city of Bern accepted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation. Lenk, along with much of the Oberland, initially resisted the new faith but was forced to accept it in the same year. In the following year, Lenk had to protect itself against the Catholic Valais. The conflicts over religion closed the Rawil Pass into Valais for a time. However, the Pass remained an important trade route until the construction of the Lötschberg railway line in 1913. In 1878 much of the village was destroyed in a fire. The parish church rebuilt three years later in 1881. In the mid 19th century tourists began to come to Lenk to see the natural attractions and to bathe in the mineral springs. A medicinal spa opened in 1843 and gradually expanded into a grand hotel by 1900. In 1969 the old hotel was replaced with a new spa and indoor pool. Today tourism is the main industry in Lenk. A number of second homes and vacation chalets were built outside the old village center. Geography The Siebenbrunnen falls Aerial view of Lenk with Wildstrubel (1957) Lenk has an area of .

The species are motile with amphitrichous flagella and rarely nonmotile. It is a genus of non-fermenting bacteria (in the family Alcaligenaceae). Additionally, some strains of Alcaligenes are capable of anaerobic respiration, but they must be in the presence of nitrate or nitrite; otherwise, their metabolism is respiratory and never fermentative; The genus does not use carbohydrates. Strains of Alcaligenes (such as A. faecalis) are found mostly in the intestinal tracts of vertebrates, decaying materials, dairy products, water, and soil; they can be isolated from human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and wounds in hospitalized patients with compromised immune systems. They are occasionally the cause of opportunistic infections, including nosocomial sepsis. Alcaligenes faecalis causes nosocomial sepsis, arising from contaminated hemodialysis or intravenous fluid, in immunocompromised patients. Alcaligenes species have been used for the industrial production of nonstandard amino acids; A. eutrophus also produces the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate. They are rods, coccal rods, or cocci, sized at about 0.5-1.0 x 0.5-2.6 μm. They are obligately aerobic, but some can undergo anaerobic respiration if nitrate is present. They tend to be colorless. They typically occur in the soil and water, and some live in the intestinal tracts of vertebrates. Samples from blood, urine, feces, discharge from ears, spinal fluid, and wounds have produced this type of bacteria. Zoonotic infections from ferrets have been recorded.Malek-Marín T et al (2009) A case of endocarditis of difficult diagnosis in dialysis: could \\"pest\\" friends be involved? Clin Nephrol 72(5):405-409 Alcaligenes species have been increasingly recovered over the past decade from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). An experiment recently examined the frequency of correct identification of Alcaligenes species by microbiology labs affiliated with American CF patient care centers. Most (89%) strains of microbial agents in these tests were correctly identified by the referring laboratories as Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. A. faecalis was isolated in 1896 by Petruschky from stale beer. Several strains of the organism have been found since then. This species is motile, flagellated, slender, slightly curved, not spore-forming, slowly growing, nonfermenting, capsule forming, Gram-negative aerobe of the family Alcaligenaceae. This species is most commonly found in the alimentary tract as a harmless saprophyte in 5% – 19% of the normal population. Systemic infection with this organism is very uncommon. It has been reported to cause sepsis, meningitis, peritonitis, enteric fever, appendicitis, cystitis, chronic suppurative otitis media, abscesses, arthritis, pneumonitis, and endocarditis. It has been associated with fatal outcomes because these organisms are resistant to commonly used antibiotics.Kavuncuoglu, F., A. Unal, N. Oguzhan, B. Tokgoz, O. Oymak, and C.

It was published on February 5, 2002. Plot Introduction Fourth graders George Beard and Harold Hutchins skate over ketchup packets in the school gym until their rude-spirited principal, Mr. Krupp, forces them to clean up the mess and meet him at his office. Since writing a sentence over and over wouldn't teach the boys anything, Mr. Krupp assigns them to write a 100-page essay on good citizenship, which they can't turn it into a Captain Underpants story. The boys promptly make a story with a new superhero called \\"Super Diaper Baby\\", which angers Krupp to the point of making them write sentences. Main plot Expectant couple Bill and Mary Hoskins rush to the hospital while Deputy Dangerous and his talking pet dog Danger Dog drain Captain Underpants of his superpowers with Deputy's fitted ray, which then converts it to a liquid the two would consume, but Danger only drinks half of it when the police arrives, whom the both evade. Back at the hospital, Mary gives birth to a boy named Billy, whom the attending doctor accidentally throws into the power container. Billy drinks the juice, gaining the super powers and he overpowers both Deputy Dangerous and Danger Dog, both of whom are then apprehended by the police. Billy then flies back to the maternity ward. Danger Dog and Deputy Dangerous escape prison to their secret lab, where the latter invents a crib device connected by satellite that they deliver to the Hoskins under euphemistic pseudonyms, \\"Deputy Un-Dangerous\\" and \\"Safety Dog\\". Billy poops before midnight, and Mary gives him a very nice bath just as the \\"Heat-Seeking Dish\\" turns on. The device transits the poop, turning Deputy Dangerous into a small piece of turd. The next morning, Deputy Dangerous invents the \\"Robo-Ant 2000\\" so he can take over the world, but Danger Dog coins the name \\"Deputy Doo-Doo\\", then changes signs around. Billy hears the robot, but is taken by Deputy Doo-Doo to a nuclear power plant. Danger Dog saves Billy, while the Ant falls into the power plant instead. Bill and Mary want to keep \\"Safety Dog\\", but the Landlord worries that Danger Dog might stain the carpet, but changes his mind when they put a diaper on him and rename him Diaper Dog. Meanwhile, back at the power plant, radioactivity causes Deputy Doo-Doo to grow into a giant and he resumes rampaging through the city. Diaper Baby and Diaper Dog fly out to stop him, but since Deputy Doo-Doo's now radioactive, they can't touch him. They instead trick him into attacking himself and wrap him up in a giant toilet roll, sending him to Uranus. On the way back to Earth, at a \\"Starbutts\\" on Mars, they decide to take some Super Power Juice back to Earth and go to the laundromat where Captain Underpants is held captive. They restore his powers, and the world is a better place. Characters *Billy Hoskins/Super Diaper Baby – the book's protagonist; he is a newborn baby who gains Captain Underpants' powers. *Danger/Diaper Dog – the Hoskins' pet puggle and Super Diaper Baby's sidekick.

Sequel On the last page of the first book, an advertisement for a sequel titled Super Diaper Baby 2: Invasion of the Potty Snatchers can be found.

The long-awaited book was finally published on June 28, 2011, named The Third Graphic Novel.  Plot summary  Introduction After Mr. Krupp reads the \\"Super Diaper Baby\\" comic, he is furious and yells at the boys for creating such a rude and offensive comic, suggesting that they try and write about something more appropriate. He gives them the book How the Grinch Stole Christmas! as an example and states that it was his favorite book during his childhood (with the last seven pages torn out). The book inspires the boys and they decide to make a sequel, about pee,which only angers Mr. Krupp even more. Main plot The Hoskins and Diaper Dog set up a picnic in the park where Billy ends up over a tree, but then he and Diaper Dog force a doll back from a bully, get a ball out of a portable toilet and get a toe- broken kid to the hospital in a few seconds. That night, Mr. Hoskins feels depressed, but after a reminder by his wife, he decides to read \\"Mechafrog and Robotoad are Enemies\\" to Billy, but he can now read it to him, instead, due to the powers he gained. Meanwhile, two criminals called Dr. Dilbert Dinkle and Petey the Cat sneak into Jim's Bank, but before Dr. Dinkle can measure for his invention, careless Petey accidentally pushes the lever and Dr. Dinkle turns into water, then Petey accidentally destroys the invention, meaning that Dr. Dinkle is made out of water permanently, but Dr. Dinkle thinks that he actually likes being made out of water when he is able to turn into a puddle and sneak into the vault to get the money. Back at his home, Dr. Dinkle finds out he will never pay the water bill, but his supply is cut off after two weeks. Petey complains he needs water for drinking, but Dr. Dinkle goes to sleep and Petey drinks him in revenge. The next morning, Dr. Dinkle yells in surprise to be let out, right when Petey needs to urinate and the cat leaps into his litter box. Dr. Dinkle discovers that he is now made out of urine as Petey coins the name \\"Rip Van Tinkle\\" and after Rip Van Tinkle's dismay, the cat points jokes to him, making him go to multiple places, all of which kick him out for reeking. The following night, Rip Van Tinkle puts Petey in the Robo Kitty 3000, before he evaporates and rains pee on people. One drop tricks Billy that he will repair the toilet, gives him a juice box in bed, then the Kitty destroys the toilet. The next day, Mr. and Mrs. Hoskins are in pain, but put on diapers, while the mayor decides to drain the pool. The pee drops unite to create Rip Van Tinkle, while Petey steals diapers to sell to the people who were robbed of toilets, but Rip Van Tinkle takes Petey's money and the cat soaks him up with toilet paper. Diaper Baby and Diaper Dog arrive, only for Petey to evolve the Robo Kitty into the Supa-Mecha Kitty 3000. Diaper Baby flies to buy catnip and pour it inside the control seat. Petey goes crazy after having the slightest sniff of the catnip, bounces around, and detaches the Supa - Mecha Kitty 3000's head. Super Diaper Baby and Diaper Dog grab Petey and carry him off to jail. A drop of pee gets flicked up and lands in the Mayor's pool, where it grows into an enlarged Rip Van Tinkle, whom the duo finds wreaking havoc at the train tracks. Rip Van Tinkle uses the train as nunchucks and hits both of them. Rip Van Tinkle overpowers the two, and smashes a building right on top of them. However, Super Diaper Baby remembers that a week before, he put his juice box in the freezer and it froze solid, giving Diaper Dog the idea to push down on the Earth. It works, making the Earth go farther and farther from the Sun. Rip Van Tinkle freezes and Diaper Dog and Super Diaper Baby carry Rip Van Tinkle while Super Diaper Baby gets an idea of how to cheer up his father. Back at the Hoskins' house, Billy tells Mr. Hoskins that there was an ice monster outside (Rip Van Tinkle) and tells his dad he's brave enough to stand up to him. Diaper Dog, hiding behind and making a voice for Rip Van Tinkle, talks to Mr. Hoskins. The \\"ice monster\\" is \\"scared\\" of Mr. Hoskins' talking and leaves Earth. While someone asks for Mr. Hoskins' autograph, Super Diaper Baby and Diaper Dog take Rip Van Tinkle to Uranus, only for Deputy Doo Doo to say The Baby again.. They come back, and take a picture with Mr. and Mrs. Hoskins with a news reporter and put on a newspaper saying \\"Diaper Clad Dad Saves The Earth!\\". Controversy Super Diaper Baby was challenged in the Riverside Unified School District for being inappropriate for children with its excessive toilet humor, and also faced criticism for its intentionally misspelled words, but a committee voted 5-2 to reject its removal. The book was removed at the Channelview Independent School District after an elementary student was suspended for a day after calling another student a \\"poo poo head\\". This book was 47th in the American Library Association's \\"Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books\\" between 2000-2009.

The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 25 in Queens. The eastern terminus is at an interchange with NY 25 in Westbury, Nassau County. NY 25B is named Hillside Avenue for its entire length, except for a brief portion in the village of East Williston, where it is called East Williston Avenue. The route, assigned in the mid-1930s, acts as a northern alternate to NY 25, running parallel to its parent for its entire length. Unlike NY 25, which is four lanes wide for most of its length between Queens and Westbury, NY 25B has a number of lane configurations, including six lanes in Queens, four lanes in western Nassau County, and two lanes in East Williston. The route also connects NY 25 to the villages of Williston Park and East Williston. Route description NY 25B is maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) within Queens and by Nassau County within the village of East Williston, where the route is co-designated but not signed as County Route 85\\\\. The remainder of the route is state-maintained. Queens Hillside Avenue changes designations from NY 25 to NY 25B at an intersection with Braddock Avenue in the Queens neighborhood of Queens Village. Here, NY 25 turns right onto Braddock while NY 25B begins and follows Hillside Avenue to the northeast. The road, a six-lane divided highway with a large, tree-lined median in the vicinity of the junction with Braddock Avenue, begins to narrow after intersecting 229th Street, passing the Martin Van Buren High School as the median is reduced to a single turning lane. At 232nd Street, the street turns to the east for three blocks before curving to the southeast at Winchester Boulevard. Fading NY 25B shield in Queens The lane composition of NY 25B remains the same as it proceeds eastward through heavily residential areas of Queens, maintaining a width of six lanes with a turning lane acting as the divider between opposing traffic. Roughly from Winchester Boulevard, NY 25B, facing northeast once more, intersects the west (southbound) frontage road of the Cross Island Parkway in Bellerose. Shortly after passing over the six-lane parkway, Hillside Avenue meets the eastern (northbound) frontage road. East of the parkway and surrounded by homes once again, NY 25B heads northeast on a linear path for a half-mile to an intersection with the Little Neck Parkway. Upon crossing the parkway, the structures along Hillside Avenue shift from residential to commercial, a trend that remains in place to the Nassau County line. Nassau County At the county line, NY 25B breaks from its previous east-northeast alignment and takes a more pronounced northeast routing through New Hyde Park. The road narrows as well, decreasing to four lanes excluding the center turning lane, with an extended shoulder taking the place of the two lost lanes. A half-mile from the county line, NY 25B enters North New Hyde Park, intersecting Lakeville Road in the center. Two blocks from Lakeville, the commercial buildings give way to residential dwellings for seven blocks before returning at the intersection of New Hyde Park Road and Hillside Avenue. Nassau County police station along NY 25B in Williston Park Past New Hyde Park Road, the buildings surrounding NY 25B become a balanced mix of commercial and residential structures. Less than a quarter of a mile from New Hyde Park Road, the road makes a turn eastward, passing to the north of the Hillside Public Library as it curves to the right. After three blocks of homes, a flurry of businesses precede a junction with Marcus Avenue, formerly part of NY 25C. The commercial presence continues for two blocks eastward before shifting back to residential structures. The four-lane NY 25B, along with a separate, parallel Hillside Avenue South, continue eastward through blocks of primarily homes to Herricks Road, where the composition of structures along NY 25B becomes a mix of commercial buildings and residential dwellings once more. Hillside Avenue continues on, entering Williston Park. On the eastern edge of the village, NY 25B narrows to two lanes as it crosses the Oyster Bay Branch of the Long Island Rail Road and enters East Williston, where the surroundings shift to residential for the final time. In the center of the village, NY 25B intersects Roslyn Road before passing by the North Side School two blocks to the east. Roughly a half-mile from the school, NY 25B enters the village of Old Westbury and passes over the eight-lane Northern State Parkway with no connection between the two. The missing link is filled by way of Glen Cove Road, which NY 25B intersects a mere from the parkway, and Jericho Turnpike (NY 25), accessible via Glen Cove Road. East of Glen Cove Road, NY 25B enters Westbury and begins to develop a large median in preparation for an interchange with NY 25 roughly to the east. Just west of the interchange, NY 25B intersects Bacon Road. from the intersection, NY 25B crosses over NY 25 west and enters the median of NY 25 prior to merging with NY 25 east, ending the NY 25B designation. History New York City did not have posted routes until mid-December 1934. Several routes that had ended at the eastern city line (the Queens–Nassau County border), such as NY 25, were extended westward at this time. By the following year, NY 25B was assigned to the portion of Hillside Avenue between Braddock Avenue in Queens and Jericho Turnpike in Westbury, serving as a northerly alternate route of NY 25 between the two locations.

History The temple of Manjunatheshwara on the hills of Kadri is said to be built during the 10th or 11th century. It was converted to a complete stone structure during the 14th century. The bronze (panchlauha) idol of Lokeshwar (identified as Brahma), about 5 feet high, of the temple is called as oldest of the South Indian temples. It has an inscription dated 968 A.D. (or 1068 A.D.Collected Papers on Buddhist Studies, Padmanabh S. Jaini, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2001 p. 148), engraved on the pedestal. The inscription states that King Kundavarma of the Alupa Dynasty installed the Lokeshwara idol in Kadarika Vihara. Worship of Lord Brahma, Part 85, 2005 It mentions Mangalore as \\"Mangalapura\\". The image has three faces and six arms, and holds and hold flowers in two of the arms. The crown depicts a Dhyani Buddha. The image has an ornate prabhavali, and two attendants. It is very well preserved with enameled eyes. There exist two other undated bronze images of similar craftsmanship, one of them is identifiable as an Avalokiteshwar (called Narayana) and other as Buddha (called Vedavyasa). Monastic Wanderers: Nāth Yogī Ascetics in Modern South Asia, Veronique Bouillier, Routledge, 2017, ch. 4. The Kadli Math History Another stone inscription in Tulu,Kannada and Malayalam scripts of 12-13th century A.D., in temple's kitchen, states that the ruler and the local landlords contributed land for the temple. A 1730 AD text Kadli Manjunath Mahatmyam gives an account of the association with Natha Mantha. It is believed that Parashurama who was living in Sahyadri, killed the kshathriyas who were cruel and donated the lands to Kashyapa. He prayed to Lord Shiva for a place to live. Lord Shiva assured Parashurama that if he performed a penance at Kadali kshethra, Lord Shiva would reincarnate as Manjunatha for the betterment of the world. As per Shiva's orders Parashurama threw his axe into the sea and created a place for his penance. Yielding to Parashurama's prayers Lord Shiva appeared to him as Manjunatha with Goddess Parvathi and stayed at Kadri for the betterment of the world. As per the orders of Manjunatha the sapthakoti manthras become the seven theerthas. This temple has Hindu and Buddhist histories. Buddhism was practised here till the 10th century AD. But after the decline of Buddhism, the devotion of Manjusri and Avalokiteśvara continued in this region. The Nath cult was embraced towards Buddhism and continued Tantric Shiva tradition as well. As a result, many Buddhist temples came into the Hindu vortex. According to M. Govinda Pai this temple was known as Kadri Manjunatha where is Manjunatha relates to Shiva and Kadri is derived from Kadri Vihara which was Buddhist monastery of Vajrayana cult. King Kundavarma of the Alupa dynasty left an inscription on the base of the Avalokiteśvara image stating he was devotee of Shiva. This image was not of Buddha, but of Bodhisattva, who was being worshiped as integrated form of Shiva. Further M. Govinda Pai has concluded this was center of Bodhisattva Manjusri's cult. And later on this Bodhisattavs were identified as Saivite deities. Shiv linga and Bodhisattva were worshiped together for centuries at this place until it was converted completely to a Saivite temple. Knadarika Vihara provides firm inscriptional evidence for this transformation. After the 11th century Brahimins took forcible possession. In front of the temple, at a height there are a number of water ponds. There's a garden surrounding the ponds. When one walks down from there in front of the temple is a huge lightpole. During karthika maasa, deepothsava is held here. There are statues of Machendranath, Gorakanath, Shringinath, Lokeshwara, Manjushri, and Buddha in the temple. Description A view near Kadri Manjunath temple Now, the chief deity of this temple is Manjunatha, which incorporates a Shiva linga. The statue of Lokeshwara in the seated position with three faces and six arms is tipped to be the best bronze statue in India. It is about 1.5 meter tall.  Gomukha and water tanks  There is a natural spring at an elevated location at the back of the temple. It is called Gomukha. It is believed that the water flows from Bhageerathi river, in Kashi and thereby it gets its name as Kashi Bhageerathi theertha. The water from this spring is let into nine ponds of different sizes adjacent to it. Visitors wash themselves in these ponds before entering the main temple. Annual festival Annual Jathra Mahothsava is held during the month of January. Nine days of festival starts on the day of makara sankranthi.

Leonard Feeney Feeney was a Roman Catholic priest and a member of the Jesuit order. The order dismissed Feeney in 1949 for disobedience, and on February 4, 1953, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (known then as the Holy Office) declared him excommunicated \\"on account of grave disobedience to Church Authority, being unmoved by repeated warnings.\\" He was reconciled to the Church in 1972. Feeney co-founded the group known as the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Salvation and baptism Catholics traditionally believe that sacramental baptism (\\"baptism of water\\") is the only way to be properly baptized. In addition, \\"the Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This Baptism of blood, like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1258. The belief in water baptism and the doctrinal position that those who are outside the Catholic Church are not saved can be found in the writings of the early fathers and the rulings of ecumenical councils. For instance, Pope Eugene IV, in the Council of Florence declared: > And since death entered the universe through the first man, ‘unless we are > born again of water and the Spirit, we cannot,’ as the Truth says, ‘enter > into the kingdom of heaven’ [John 3:5]. The matter of this sacrament is real > and natural water.Denzinger 696; Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils, Vol. 1, > p. 542. St. John Chrysostom: > And well should the pagan lament, who not knowing God, dying goes straight > to punishment. Well should the Jew mourn, who not believing in Christ, has > assigned his soul to perdition.Saint John Chrysostom, “The Consolation of > Death,” Sunday Sermons of the Great Fathers, vol. IV, p. 363. Pope Gregory XVI: > Finally some of these misguided people attempt to persuade themselves and > others that men are not saved only in the Catholic religion, but that even > heretics may attain eternal life. Feeney felt that, in the previous two centuries, some tended to broaden the notion of \\"baptism of desire\\" to include all who try to live good lives, even those who desired no relationship with the Catholic Church. Feeney argued that those who are truly sincere will be led by God to the Catholic Church. He also accepted no form of baptism as opening the way to salvation other than by water and only within the Catholic Church, but he did say that this was an opinion. He denied the salvational efficacy of the mere wish alone, even the explicit wish to be baptized, and held that God must have provided those martyrs who apparently died for the faith without being baptized with a minister and water to baptize them before their death.Father Feeney and Catholic Doctrine — A Reply to Verbum Feeney and his followers maintain that there is a contradiction between the Second Vatican Council's document Lumen gentium and earlier authoritative statements, which they interpret as saying that non-Catholics are indiscriminately damned. His followers interpret the Catholic Church's declarations that outside of the Church there is no salvation as excluding from salvation people such as the American Indians who lived between the times of Christ and Columbus, because they could not have been baptized (unless some Christian missionaries did manage to reach and baptize them in the Catholic faith).The Salvation of the Pre-Columbian Amerindians Splits After Feeney's death, his spiritual descendants soon split into several groups because of various power struggles. The two most prominent both use the name Saint Benedict Center. All use the pre-Vatican II form of the Roman Rite liturgy. Three of these groups are located on or near the land to where Feeney moved in Still River, Massachusetts: * The Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, a group of men and women in private vows, staff the Saint Benedict Center. Their apostolates include education (operating Immaculate Heart of Mary School), publishing and a summer camp for boys and girls. They were raised to a Public Association of the Faithful in 2017 by Bishop Robert McManus. * The Sisters of the Saint Benedict Center operate Saint Anne's House, an order of diocesan right in the Diocese of Worcester.\\"Religious Communities\\", Diocese of Worcester * St. Benedict Abbey is a house of Benedictine monks. The other branch, located in Richmond, New Hampshire, has no official recognition by the Catholic Church. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) classifies the center in Richmond, as well as the group's publishing arm Immaculate Heart Media, as an anti-Semitic hate group. The SPLC wrote that the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary \\"continue to endorse Feeney and to defend him from charges of anti-Semitism, despite his well-documented hatred of the Jews\\" and noted that in 2004, Bishop McCormack had rebuked the group as \\"blatantly anti-Semitic\\", and that in 2005, a brother of the Slaves had given a speech calling out the \\"Jewish nation\\" as \\"the perpetual enemy of Christ.\\" The center denies being anti-Semitic. In January 2019, the vicar for canonical affairs for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester stated that the group had been directed to stop representing themselves as Catholic.Fisher, Damian. \\"NH-based 'only Catholics go to heaven' group sanctioned by Church; aspiring nun allegedly held against her will\\", New Hampshire Union Leader, January 8, 2019Moore, Michael. \\"Manchester diocese forbids Catholics from activities at St. Benedict Center\\", Keene Sentinel, January 9, 2019 The diocese published a clarification of the status of the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the St. Benedict Center, declaring that they were neither approved by the diocese nor considered to be Catholic.Diocese of Manchester: The Catholic Church in New Hampshire. \\"Frequently Asked Questions.\\" URL: https://www.catholicnh.org/about/stay- informed/frequently-asked-questions/#stbenedict. The diocese and Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome found unacceptable that the St. Benedict Center teaches that non-Catholics cannot be saved. That same document further states that priests are forbidden to say Mass at any church or chapel owned by the St. Benedict Center or the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In 1978, three sisters from Feeney's original group sought to become Benedictine nuns. Nuns from Stanbrook Abbey helped establish their priory, which was formally erected in 1984 as Saint Scholastica Priory. The nuns were later joined by a group of Benedictine monks who were established as Saint Mary Monastery, a dependent house of Pluscarden Abbey. Condemnation of Feeneyite view In a 1949 letter to Cardinal Cushing, Archbishop of Boston, the Holy Office (now the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) condemned Feeney's teaching that the only those formally baptized in the Catholic Church can be saved. The Holy Office affirmed that those baptized by their desire can be saved. This letter was sent by Cardinal Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani to Cardinal Cushing and had a private sign in the end, meaning that the 1949 correspondence was supposed to be read only by the two cardinals and not distributed. This letter is a footnote to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 847 DS 3866-3872, in its section \\"Outside the Church there is no salvation\\".

It is one of the shortest state routes in New York, extending for just from the Pennsylvania state line south of the village center to an intersection with NY 427 just north of it. The route serves as the main street of Wellsburg in both function and name. There is no corresponding signed state route on the Pennsylvania side of the border; instead, the road becomes State Route 4013 (SR 4013), one of Pennsylvania's unsigned quadrant routes. NY 367 originally extended north to Lowman when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It was truncated to its current length in 1949. Route description NY 367 at the Pennsylvania-New York state line NY 367 begins at the Pennsylvania state line at Wellsburg, where the route connects to Berwick Turnpike, a highway designated but not signed as SR 4013, one of Pennsylvania's quadrant routes. The route heads north from the state line as Main Street, proceeding north through the southern portion of the village and intersecting a local street named Doty Hill Road. Not far to the north, Berwick Turnpike leaves to the northwest while NY 367 makes a slight turn to the northeast. The route continues on, crossing over Bentley Creek and entering the central district of the village of Wellsburg, where the majority of east–west streets are numbered. Here, NY 367 serves Ashland Town Hall at the intersection of Main and 6th streets and the Wellsburg Village Centre on 5th Street. NY 367 proceeds north past five more blocks of homes and businesses before ending at a junction with NY 427 (Front Street) just south of the Chemung River. History The north–south highway connecting Wellsburg to the Pennsylvania state line was taken over by the state of New York in the mid-1920s. It did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became the southern half of NY 367, a new route extending from the Pennsylvania state line at Wellsburg to NY 17 (now County Route 60 or CR 60) in the hamlet of Lowman. The route continued north from Wellsburg to Lowman by way of a short piece of NY 17D (later NY 427) and Lowman Crossover. NY 367 was truncated to its current northern terminus at NY 427 in Wellsburg on January 1, 1949.

She later became a household name in Puerto Rico during the 70s as she became part of the cast in the show Los Garcia. Early years Manela was the only daughter of Spanish immigrants; her father was the owner of a guesthouse in Havana but lost the business during the depression of the 1930s. After finishing her basic education at age 20, Manela embarked to pursue her desire to make a living in the entertainment world. She toured around Latin America in a theatre company and worked for the Cuban radio station CMQ as a singer and story narrator.  Television career  Cachucha y Ramón  Manela became a famous TV star in the mid-1950s with her character of “Cachucha” in the TV comedy “Cachucha y Ramon” together with co-star, Idalberto Delgado as “Ramon”. The show (mostly live), originally produced by Francisco Vergara and sponsored by Uncle Ben's rice, grew in popularity from the mid 1950s to the mid 1960s. In a trip to N.Y. Manela appeared in a Garry Moore show, as his show was also sponsored by Uncle Ben's rice. After Cuba fell to communism in 1959, Francisco Vergara left Cuba to sell the idea of the show to other Latin American countries. It is known that a copy of the show, its same title, and characters was done in Venezuela at the same time the original show was still running in Cuba. Exile, Los Garcia The show ended when Manela Bustamante went empty handed into exile with her family. After leaving Cuba in 1971, she lived in Spain for three years, and moved to Puerto Rico in 1974. In Spain, Manela put her artistic career on hang; it was her husband that became able to provide the main monetary income for the family as an architect. In Puerto Rico, Manela Bustamante became “Doña Tony” in the popular TV show “Los Garcia”, produced by Tommy Muñiz. She also did several commercials including a small role in the 1988 soap opera “Ave de Paso.” Her last TV appearance was in 2004 as a special guest in a one-hour tribute to “Los Garcia”. Manela Bustamante died a year later in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on February 12, 2005, and is survived by her daughter and two grandsons.

Michael was last seen that day around 12:30pm at the playground as his mother Crystal Dunahee was participating in a female football practice to which his father was a spectator. Although he disappeared metres from his parents, no witnesses to his disappearance have ever been identified. Michael's disappearance became one of the largest police investigations in Canadian history, and to this day, over 11,000 tips have been received by the police. The case was a major story for many years, and was reported across Canada and the United States. However, despite a large number of tips and a reward, the police still do not have any solid leads in the case.  Disappearance  On March 24, 1991, Michael and his family went to Blanshard Elementary School for his mother Crystal's flag football practice. Michael was wearing a blue hooded jacket, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles T-shirt, rugby pants, and blue sneakers that day. The family arrived at the school around 12:30pm, and when they got there, Michael asked his mom if he could visit the playground, which was near the field where the football practice was taking place. Despite having a gut feeling that \\"something wasn't quite right\\", Crystal allowed him to walk over to the playground by himself, but told him that once he got there, he had to \\"stay there and wait for Daddy to come\\". However, when Michael's dad Bruce came to the playground, Michael was not there. Around fifty people began to look for Michael, and his parents immediately notified the police.  Investigation   Initial search efforts  At that time, the investigation regarding Michael's disappearance became one of the largest in Canadian history, and still remains one of the largest today. Since Michael disappeared so quickly from a public place, the police quickly classified his case as an abduction rather than a missing child case, and all the detectives from the Victoria Police Department were called in to solve the case. Hundreds of tips began coming in every hour from across British Columbia and North America, and during that time had to be written on carbon paper and sorted out manually. The police believe that if they had current technology, such as video surveillance, DNA techniques, and a computer system to sort out tips, the case might have been solved. Victoria detectives investigated known sex offenders and interviewed anyone who had been in the area around the time of Michael's disappearance, but were unable to find much information except a witness report that \\"a man in his late 40s or early 50s\\" with a brown van was near the playground. A month after Michael disappeared, the police staged a re-creation of his disappearance at Blanshard Elementary using a brown van, but were unable to produce any new leads.  Reported sightings  In 2006, reports of a young man who physically resembled Michael and had been living in the Interior of British Columbia since 1990 breathed new life into the case. However, this young man was confirmed by DNA testing not to be Michael. In early 2009, police in Milwaukee, Wisconsin found a missing person poster of Michael at the home of Vernon Seitz, 62, who had confessed to his psychiatrist that he had murdered a child in 1959 when he was 12 and knew of another child killing. Seitz was later found dead by Milwaukee police, apparently from natural causes. In 2011, with the 20th anniversary of Michael's disappearance approaching, the police were notified of a man living in Chase, British Columbia who looked like Michael, but DNA testing later confirmed that he was not Michael. In 2013, a man with the username Canuckels posted on the message boards of the Vancouver Canucks' official website claiming that the police were coming for a DNA test. They had requested a blood sample from a man in Surrey, British Columbia who they believed could possibly be Michael. However, on September 9, the Victoria Police Department stated that the Surrey man was not Michael after DNA testing was done.  Latest developments  Michael's case remains open, with officers still committed to continuing the investigation. Both the police and Michael's family remain hopeful and believe that one day a tip will come in that will provide them with an answer about his whereabouts. 2016 marked the 25th anniversary of Michael's disappearance, and to this day tips continue to come in from the public, especially around the anniversary of his disappearance each year.  Impact  Many Victoria residents recalled the day of Michael's disappearance as a \\"loss of innocence\\" for the city, as the fact that a child had been abducted in their community came as a shock. Fears and concerns about child abduction quickly began to rise among parents, kids, and schools in the months after the disappearance. Crystal became an advocate for missing children's issues in British Columbia, and has served as the president of Child Find British Columbia. In 2002, she lent her voice to support the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in calls to introduce an Amber Alert system in the province, as she believed that her son would have been found if such a program existed in 1991. The system has since been implemented in most regions of Canada. The community of Esquimalt, part of the Greater Victoria metropolitan area, holds an annual charity event called the Michael Dunahee \\"Keep the Hope Alive\\" Fund Run to raise money for Child Find. This event is organized by Michael's sister Caitlin.

Though he published several collections of stories, as well as volumes of translations, Holst was known primarily for the captivating live performances of his work that he regularly conducted, particularly in the New York City area, in a distinctive mellifluous, rhythmically cadenced voice. In his heyday he was often heard on the radio on New York's listener-sponsored radio station, WBAI. For many years until his death, he lived at Westbeth Artists Housing in NYC. In addition to presenting readings there, he exhibited his watercolour paintings, many based on invented calligraphic motifs. The paintings were often shown with lengthy titles attached, some were small stories in themselves. The typical Holst story might be a gentle but twisted fable, such as the tale of a frog who, having become addicted to morphine during a laboratory experiment, was rejected by the woman whose kiss transformed him back into a prince because he was, after all, only a junkie. Holst also wrote a number of paragraph-length prose pieces, which distilled a brief scene or anecdote into a glimmering, evanescent koan.

Brown is co-founder of the Public Library of Science, inventor of the DNA microarray, and a former investigator at Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Education Brown received each of his degrees from the University of Chicago, including his B.S. in 1976 and M.D. in 1982. His Ph.D., granted in 1980 while under the guidance of Nicholas R. Cozzarelli, involved the study of DNA topoisomerases. Academic career After getting his medical degree in 1982, Brown completed a 3-year pediatric residency at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago but decided he could have a greater impact through basic research. In 1985, Brown took a 3-year postdoctoral fellowship at University of California, San Francisco with J. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus (who shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discoveries about how genes can ignite cancerous tumors). At UCSF, Brown and colleagues defined the mechanism by which retroviruses, such as the AIDS virus, integrate their genes into the genome of the cells they infect, which helped lead to development of new drugs to fight the disease. In 1988, Brown became an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford University School of Medicine, where he continued to investigate retroviral replication. In the early 1990s, Brown began developing a new technology to enable systematic investigation of the behavior and properties of whole genomes—called DNA microarrays. \\"I had a mental image of a DNA microarray, even including the red and green fluorescent spots, a few years before I'd figured out the details of making them,\\" Brown told The Scientist. Brown and his colleagues created a robotic dispenser that could deposit minute quantities of tens of thousands of individual genes onto a single glass slide, a “DNA microarray” or \\"gene chip.\\" By flooding the slide with fluorescently labeled genetic material derived from a living sample, a researcher could see which genes were being expressed in cells. Shortly after their first description of DNA microarrays, the Brown laboratory published a “how-to” manual on the Web that helped these robotic devices become standard equipment in life science labs throughout the world, in an effort led by Joe DeRisi, Michael Eisen, Ash Alizadeh, and others. Brown and his colleagues developed experimental methods for using DNA microarrays to investigate basic principles of genome organization, gene expression, cell regulation and specialization, physiology, development and disease, and the microbiome, along with statistical and computational tools for visualizing and interpreting the resulting large volumes of data. This work was especially revealing for the molecular portraits of many human cancers including lymphomas such as DLBCL, breast cancers, and other tumors, as part of diverse global collaborations including David Botstein, Michael Eisen, Lou Staudt, Ash Alizadeh, and others. Microarray technologies are widely used for comparing gene expression patterns and other genome features among individuals and their tissues and cells, providing information on disease subcategories, disease prognosis, and treatment outcome. Starting in the late 1990s, Brown began publicly voicing concern over what he called \\"a fundamentally flawed process of scientific publishing,\\" in which academics typically published results of publicly funded research in private, commercial publishing houses that charged subscription fees for access to journals. “We viewed this entire process as being patently unfair. Not only were scientists in poor countries being denied access to the latest and best information out there, but the public who supports this research was being denied access as well. We felt there simply had to be a better way to do it,\\" Brown told a University of Chicago medical journal. Brown began a collaboration with other scientists, including Harold Varmus (then director of the National Institutes of Health), David J. Lipman (then director of the National Center for Biotechnology Information), and Michael Eisen of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to overhaul the scientific and medical publishing systems to make papers available on the rapidly developing Internet platforms such as Usenet and the World Wide Web. \\"Why should publishers be able to control what I can do with information that was published by my scientific colleagues whose motivation was exactly to have their discoveries contribute to future discoveries? ... We had already existing tools that we could use to so to speak hyperlink things so that you could reorganize information in systematic ways, but they weren't really being exploited by the conventional scientific literature,\\" Brown said in an interview with BioMedCentral Biology. The magazine Nature reported that the scientists' open-access movement could \\"spell the end for many print titles\\"; Brown called subscription-based scientific journals \\"anachronisms.\\" In 2001, Brown, Eisen and Varmus co-founded the Public Library of Science (PLOS) to make published scientific research open access and freely available to researchers in the scientific community. Funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the non-profit organization advocated for designing alternative systems to fund for scientific publishing. In 2002, Brown was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences, identifying him as one of the top 2000 scientists in the nation. He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Impossible Foods In 2009, Brown took an 18-month sabbatical where he considered how to spend the rest of his career. Brown decided that the world's largest environmental problem,, and the problem where he could have the most impact, was the use of animals to produce food. He organized a conference to raise awareness of the problem.http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static- assets/banr/AnimalProductionMaterials/ScopingWorkshopBackground.pdf But the National Research Council workshop, called \\"The Role of Animal Agriculture in a Sustainable 21st Century Global Food System,” had minimal impact; soon after, he decided the best way to reduce animal agriculture was to offer a competing product in the free market. By the end of his sabbatical, Brown had articulated the first steps of his business plan and began to recruit a small team of scientists to determine precisely why meat smells, handles, cooks and tastes like meat. Brown said he had a \\"hunch\\" that the key to meat's unique taste was its high abundance of heme, an iron-containing molecule in blood that carries oxygen and is found in all living organisms. Brown theorized that, if he could generate large amounts of heme from plant sources, he could recreate the taste of animal meat. Brown and a small group of early employees tested the hunch by digging up clover roots, which for the plant kingdom contain high amounts of heme. \\"I dissected them off with a razor blade then blended them up just to see what I could extract. I was just poking around, feasibility-testing some ideas. I got to a point where, though I didn’t have much data, I had enough to go and talk to some venture-capital companies — of which there are a ridiculous number in Silicon Valley — and hit them for some money,” Brown told The Sunday Times. Brown raised a Series A round of $9 million from Khosla Ventures and founded Impossible Foods in July 2011. Brown and his team spent five years researching and developing the Impossible Burger, which launched in restaurants in 2016. Impossible Foods is also working on plant-based pork, chicken, fish and dairy products made without any animals. Brown strongly supports labeling Impossible Foods’ products as “meat,” regardless of its source. In a 2018 interview with Quartz, he noted, “animals have just been the technology we have used up until now to produce meat... What consumers value about meat has nothing to do with how it’s made. They just live with the fact that it’s made from animals. If we’re producing a product that is delivering everything that is of value in meat for consumers, it’s filling that niche.” This assessment, according to Brown, appropriately categorizes meat by “what functional role it plays,” rather than its source of origin. These statements have put Brown at odds with the meat industry, which by mid-2019 had successfully pressured state legislatures in Missouri and Arkansas to pass laws barring plant-based protein manufacturers such as Impossible Foods and competitor Beyond Meat from labeling their products as “meat.” Awards In 2000, Brown received the National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology. In 2002 he received a Takeda award, recognizing his work in \\"the development of DNA microarrays with pre-synthesized DNA probes and the promotion of the technology by releasing the production methods on the Internet.\\" In 2005 he received the Curt Stern Award for his contributions to the development and application of gene-based expression microarrays. In 2006 he received the American Cancer Society's Medal of Honor for Basic Research, acknowledging \\"his revolutionary development of low-cost, accessible automated microarrays, and his life-saving contributions to the field of functional genomics...which in turn has produced insights into critical genetic information for diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, prostate cancer, and early stage breast cancer.\\" In 2010 the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) selected Brown for the ABRF 2010 Award in recognition of Brown's pioneering work in the development of microarrays and the diverse applications of this technology in genetic research.http://conf.abrf.org/archives/abrf2010/index.cfm/page/ConfProg/ABRF_Award.htm In 2016, the Geneva, Switzerland-based World Economic Forum named Brown a Technology Pioneer for his design, development and deployment of new technologies and innovations \\"poised to have a significant impact on business and society.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pya2sW7my0 External links References Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:American biochemists Category:Howard Hughes Medical Investigators Category:Stanford University School of Medicine faculty Category:Members of the National Academy of Medicine Category:Public Library of Science people Category:Open access activists Category:Founders ","title":"Patrick O.

Her PhD is in Brazilian literature, but her early work also focused on utopian and dystopian fiction. She is the daughter of the anthropologist Raphael Patai. Critique of feminist politics After spending ten years with a joint appointment in women's studies and in Portuguese, Patai became highly critical of what she saw as the imposition of a political agenda on educational programs. In Patai's view, this politicization not only debases education, but also threatens the integrity of education generally. Having done, earlier in her career, a good deal of research using personal interview techniques, she drew on these techniques in her book, co-authored with philosopher of science Noretta Koertge, entitled Professing Feminism. Their research included personal interviews with feminist professors who had become disillusioned with feminist initiatives in education. Drawing on these interviews and on materials defining and defending women's studies programs, the book analyzed practices within women's studies that the authors felt were incompatible with serious education and scholarship -- above all, the explicit subservience of educational to political aims. A recent enlarged edition of this book provided extensive documentation from current feminist writings of the continuation, and indeed exacerbation, of these practices. Routinely challenged by feminists who declare that \\"all education is political,\\" Patai has responded with the claim that this view is simplistic. She argues that a significant difference exists between the reality that education may have political implications and the intentional use of education to indoctrinate. The latter, she argues, is no more acceptable when done by feminists than when done by fundamentalists. Patai's thesis is that a failure to defend the integrity of education and a habit of dismissing data and research on political grounds, not only seriously hurt students but also leave feminists helpless in trying to defend education against other ideological incursions (such as intelligent design). Only positive knowledge, respect for logic, evidence, and scrupulous scholarship not held to political standards, Patai contends, can lead to a better future. Twentieth-century examples of contrary educational practices have a sordid history, one that has hardly promoted women's rights (or any other human rights). Among Patai's concerns are what she sees as draconian sexual harassment regulations as implemented in the academic world. She argues that contemporary feminism is poisoned by a strong element of hostility to sexual interaction between men and women and an effort to suppress it through micromanagement of everyday relations. This idea is developed in her 1998 book Heterophobia: Sexual Harassment and the Future of Feminism. Patai has also written about the negative impact of Critical Theory on the study of literature. Together with Will H. Corral she edited Theory's Empire: An Anthology of Dissent (Columbia University Press), a collection of essays by fifty scholars taking issue with Theory orthodoxies of the past few decades. Patai insists that to criticize feminism and women's studies is not to seek to turn the clock back. From her perspective, she is addressing her critiques to other educators (including feminist educators), in the hope that they will see the importance of defending education from those who want to force it into a particular political mould, regardless of the popularity of particular views at any given moment. Other work Patai is credited with discovering who wrote the notable feminist dystopian novel Swastika Night and other feminist speculative fiction in the 1930s. They were published under the pseudonym of Murray Constantine but were written by an English woman named Katharine Burdekin. Patai has been involved in their republication. In addition to her work on women's studies and feminism, she continues to write about utopian studies and oral history. Many of her opinion pieces have appeared in the Chronicle of Higher Education and in the online magazine Minding the Campus. She serves on the Board of Directors of The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a non-profit organization devoted to protecting First Amendment rights on college campuses. In 2008 Patai published What Price Utopia? Essays on Ideological Policing, Feminism, and Academic Affairs (Rowman and Littlefield) -- which brings together her writing on the culture wars of the past two decades and also includes a few new pieces.

FORGE was founded by Stanford University graduate Kjerstin Erickson at the age of 20 in 2003. Since its founding, FORGE has implemented over seventy community development projects that have served more than 70,000 refugees in four refugee camps in Zambia and Botswana. An official Operating Partner of the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR), FORGE works in Zambia, hand-in-hand with refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Rwanda, Burundi, and Sudan. FORGE’s Mission FORGE aims to build upon the capacity of African refugees to cultivate empowered communities and to create the conditions for peace and prosperity in their countries. FORGE believes that individuals affected by war are a key factor to breaking the cycle of war and poverty in Africa. Instead of providing relief work for refugees, FORGE aims at providing education and training to refugees in order to empower them with greater economic and leadership capacity. There are five main project areas that FORGE is now working on: Education, Economic Development, Health Education, Women’s Empowerment and Community Enrichment. Recently, FORGE has launched a new program called the Collaborative Project Planning Process (CPPP). Believing that the most effective, relevant and sustainable development projects come from the insights and vision of the refugee community itself, FORGE launched the CPPP to provide refugees with the resources that are unreachable to them when building education and enrichment projects for their communities. Collaborative Project Planning Process (CPPP) The collaborative project is a partnership built between FORGE and refugee leaders in the refugee camps where FORGE currently works. The planning of the project involves the following four stages. *Stage I - Identification of needs: The refugee community identifies its top needs and priorities. *Stage II – Assessment of needs: Selected community leaders research and evaluate these needs. *Stage III – Project proposal: The best intervention point is selected and leaders submit a Project Proposal to FORGE’s website for funding. *Stage IV – Funding and implementation: Once funded, the project is implemented, monitored and sustained by the community. To begin the CPPP, FORGE first recruits potential refugee leaders who are especially capable of spearheading development initiatives in the refugee camps. The CPPP then goes through the Stages I, II and III. The preparation work is all done by the refugee leaders and the role of the FORGE staff member is to give advice to the refugee leaders when necessary. After all four stages of the CPPP are complete, the projects designed by the refugee leaders will begin and they are to run the projects for at least a year. The funding for new projects is coordinated by FORGE headquarters in the United States and is managed by a FORGE field staff member who serves as a facilitator and an adviser of the refugee leaders as well as a bridge of communication between the refugee camps and the US office. Fundraising for new projects is basically the responsibility of the US office, although most international staff based in Zambia, including project managers, are required to raise a minimum of $5,000 to offset the costs of their monthly stipends. The fundraising for the Collaborative Projects happen between stage 2 and stage 3. There are currently three projects underway in this collaborative approach. They are the Block H Reliable Seed & Market Program, Mwangaza Education Centers and FORGE Health Service. These projects are now going through stage two and heading towards stage three. FORGE’s Development and Future Since its establishment, FORGE has worked in four refugee camps in Botswana and Zambia in central Africa. As the refugee camp in Botswana was beginning to decrease in size and the refugees were repatriating, FORGE started to retreat from the area and focus its work in Zambia where a large number of refugees have come from the countries surrounding Zambia due to civil wars. FORGE has been working closely with the refugees in three refugee camps in Zambia: Meheba, Kala and Mwange. As peace was proclaimed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Congolese refugees in Kala and Mwange camps were beginning to repatriate under UNHCR's assistance. In light of this, FORGE is now planning to expand its work to the Congo in the coming years. FORGE aims to continue to support and help the former refugees to rebuild their lives in their home country of Congo by providing education, training and counseling until the people genuinely feel safe living in their homeland and have confidence to rebuild their communities on their own. As of December 2009, FORGE no longer operates in Kala and Mwange refugee camps.

He arrived at MIT in 1953 and retired in 1988 after a distinguished career in which he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. He played a key role in the development of MIT's Department of Biology as a major force in biochemistry research and was himself a prominent researcher of purine biosynthesis. He died in 2007 at age 89. Early life and education Buchanan was born in Winamac, Indiana, in 1917. He became interested in a career in science during a high school chemistry course. He attended DePauw University as an undergraduate, where he gained his first scientific research experience, and from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1938. He received his M.S. from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 1939, and later identified the head of its chemistry department, Howard B. Lewis, as a key influence in his research career. Buchanan received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1943 under the supervision of Albert Baird Hastings. Academic career Buchanan arrived at MIT in 1953 after reaching the rank of full professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He had been heavily recruited by the head of what was then called the Department of Molecular Biology, Francis O. Schmitt. He became the head of the Division of Biochemistry and quickly began recruiting faculty interested in biochemistry research, including Gene Brown, Vernon Ingram, Salvador Luria, Paul Schimmel, Phil Robbins and Lisa Steiner (the first woman faculty member in the department, hired in 1967). He also sought out more senior scientists to bring to MIT, including Cyrus Levinthal, Maurice Fox and Alexander Rich. James Killian, the MIT president responsible for recruiting Buchanan, described the hire as among the most important and expensive hires he made, because the department's biochemistry division under Buchanan's leadership quickly became widely well-regarded in the field. Later, as biochemistry became more established, Buchanan opposed some of the decisions made in the department, such as the shutdown of the Division of Biochemistry under department head Boris Magasanik and the planning under subsequent department head Gene Brown to launch the Whitehead Institute. Buchanan was awarded the Eli Lilly Award in Biological Chemistry in 1951. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953 and to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1962. Buchanan became the first John and Dorothy Wilson Professor in 1966 and retained the title till he retired in 1988. In 2006, MIT endowed an annual lectureship in his name. Research Buchanan's graduate research formed one of the earliest uses of radiolabeling for studying metabolism. He is best known for his research on the biosynthesis of purines. Often working in parallel with G. Robert Greenberg, Buchanan's research group made so much progress on this topic that they laid out their findings in a series of over 20 papers published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Buchanan and Greenberg's work together provided an understanding of the pathway through which purine bases could be converted to nucleotides. Personal life Buchanan met his wife Elsa during a visit to Stockholm to work with Hugo Theorell. The two were married for 57 years and had four children. Buchanan died in 2007 at age 89.

The film is based on the 1983 cartoon series created by DIC Entertainment and is a sequel to the 1999 film, Inspector Gadget. Unlike the first film, Inspector Gadget 2 is considered a more faithful adaptation of the original animated series. The characters' personalities were altered to be more in line with their cartoon counterparts and Dr. Claw's face is never shown. Gadget and Claw are never referred to as \\"John Brown\\" and \\"Sanford Scolex\\", their respective civilian names from the first film (though Claw's communicator is still labeled as \\"Scolex Industries\\"). With the exception of D. L. Hughley, who returned as the voice of the Gadgetmobile, none of the actors from the 1999 film reprised their roles. Plot Inspector Gadget (French Stewart) and his Gadgetmobile (voiced by D.L. Hughley) are having problems in their line of work, mostly because of Gadget's overzealous nature and his paranoia about minor crimes committed by citizens. Gadget is put on probation by an angry Chief Quimby (Mark Mitchell) after criminally charging Quimby's mother for going slightly above the speed limit on a mostly-deserted highway. At this time, Dr. Claw (Tony Martin) escapes from prison, seeking to get revenge against Gadget for putting him in prison and to restart his multi-million-dollar empire. Mayor Wilson (Sigrid Thornton) takes this opportunity to create G2 (Elaine Hendrix), a female Gadget-type robot that can function normally compared to the original Gadget, who not only was born a human but has been malfunctioning as of late. Gadget begins to fall in love with G2, though G2 does not reciprocate as she prefers to work alone, viewing him as a nuisance. Dr. Claw begins a new plan to steal gold from the United States Treasury. Gadget makes repeated attempts to stop Claw, but is continually foiled by his own bumbling and gadgetry glitches. Gadget's bumbling allows Dr. Claw's men to steal components for Claw's latest scheme and get away with it. Chief Quimby becomes increasingly frustrated and eventually fires Gadget, despite Gadget having enough evidence from scientists to prove that it wasn't his fault. When Penny (Caitlin Wachs) realizes that her uncle was fired and asks if there is anything she can do to help, Gadget tells her that she is still too young and to not get involved. Meanwhile, Dr. Claw's henchmen are now free to steal the rest of the components for Claw's scheme. Penny decides to examine the evidence on her own and eventually finds Claw's hideout at an abandoned bowling factory in the outskirts of the city. She infiltrates the hideout, but Claw and his men capture her. At the gala, Gadget gets a job as a limo driver. Inside the gala, Claw activates a bowling pin containing laughing gas to keep the people busy as he steals a 50,000-karat ruby, however G2 is immune to the gas. In order to stop the robot, Claw uses a magnet to trap G2. Afterwards, Claw and his minions escape, but Gadget fails to recognize them. After G2's failure, Quimby is ordered by Mayor Wilson to deactivate the robot and end the Gadget program. Feeling that G2 was scapegoated, and still in love with her, Inspector Gadget goes to the police department to reactivate G2. Brain (voiced by Jeff Glenn Bennett), having escaped Claw's men, tells them through a dog translation device that Claw has kidnapped Penny and has used the three stolen supplies (ionic fuel cells, a protoid laser, and a ruby) to build a super-weapon. Upon realizing that Claw is based in the bowling factory, Gadget finally connects the evidence Penny previously presented to him (the bowling shoe) and regrets not listening to her. Gadget asks G2 to help him save Penny and foil Claw's scheme, and G2 agrees. The next day, Claw activates his machine, which was hidden in a truck. The weapon is a laser that freezes time in Riverton, allowing Claw and his minions to easily rob the Federal Reserve. Claw has plans to not only use the laser against Riverton, but also the entire world, so he can rob Fort Knox and a variety of other places. Both Gadgets manage to avoid the weapon's blast, and find Claw and his minions at the Federal Reserve. At the treasury, Claw orders his minions to attack Gadget and G2 so he can get away. Gadget and G2 decide to switch chips in order to make Gadget work perfectly, leaving G2 to deal with the glitches but to still successfully capture Claw's hired goons. Gadget chases after Claw, who is escaping in an ice cream truck, but Claw drops Penny off the truck with explosives attached to her. After saving Penny's life from an explosion, Gadget and Penny reunite with G2 and the Gadgetmobile. At a bridge, Gadget stops Claw's truck with a puddle of bubble gum. Claw's minions try to escape, but get stuck in the smear of bubble gum and are arrested. When Gadget orders Claw to put his hand (and claw) up, Claw gets away in a rocket-like escape pod, proclaiming: \\"You may have won this round, but I'll get you next time, Gadget!\\" After Claw escapes, Gadget, Penny and G2 go to Claw's laser to unfreeze the world. Both Gadget and G2 are congratulated by Mayor Wilson and Chief Quimby (who happily rehires Gadget) Afterwards, Gadget and G2 share a kiss outside the city hall. In the process, fireworks emerge from Gadget's hat. A firecracker lands right near Quimby and Wilson and the fuse burns out.

New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996 Seizing power in a coup in 1876, Díaz pursued a policy of \\"order and progress,\\" inviting foreign investment in Mexico and maintaining social and political order, by force if necessary. There were tremendous economic, technological, social, and cultural changes during this period. As Díaz approached his 80th birthday in 1910, having been continuously elected since 1884, he still had not put in place a plan for his succession. The fraudulent 1910 elections are usually seen as the end of the Porfiriato. Violence broke out, Díaz was forced to resign and go into exile, and Mexico experienced a decade of regional civil war, the Mexican Revolution.  Porfiriato as a historical period  Historians have investigated the era of Díaz's presidency as a cohesive historical period based on political transitions.Stevens, D.F. \\"Porfirio Díaz\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 2, p. 378. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. In particular, this means separating the period of \\"order and progress\\" after 1884 from the tumultuous decade of the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) and post-Revolution developments, but increasingly the Porfiriato is seen as laying the basis for post-revolutionary Mexico.Bunker, Steven B. and William H. Beezley. \\"Porfiriato: Interpretations\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1169–1173 Under Díaz, Mexico was able to centralize authority, manage political infighting, tamp down banditry, and shift tendencies of economic nationalism to embrace foreign investment. That major economic shift allowed rapid economic and technological change, an openness to cultural innovation, increasing urbanization, and shifts in societal attitudes of elites. The benefits of economic growth were unevenly distributed and social ills increased, including debt peonage of the peasantry and child labor in new industrial enterprises.Camp, \\"Porfiriato\\", p. 440 The defeat of Mexican conservatives in the War of the Reform and the French intervention in Mexico cleared a path for liberals to implement their vision of Mexico. Díaz, after whom the period is named, was a liberal Mexican army general who had distinguished himself during the War of Reform and the French intervention. He had aspirations to be president of Mexico, which came to fruition when he rebelled against Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada under the Plan of Tuxtepec. He initially ruled from 1876 until 1880. Díaz's first term is sometimes treated separately, as he consolidated power and sought the U.S. government's recognition of his regime. The Plan of Tuxtepec explicitly called for no reelection of the president, so at the end of Díaz's term, a political ally from the Federal Army, General Manuel González, became president for one term. In 1884, Díaz abandoned the principle of no reelection and returned to the presidency, not relinquishing it until 1911. Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in 1910, campaigning under the slogan \\"Effective suffrage, no reelection.\\"Katz, Friedich, \\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato, 1867-1910\\" in Mexico Since Independence, Leslie Bethell, ed.

Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press 1981. Political order Rural on board a train. Photograph Manuel Ramos, published in La Revista de Revistas, May 1912 Starting with Díaz's second term (1884–88), following the interregnum of President González, the regime has been characterized as a dictatorship, with no opponents of Díaz elected to Congress and Díaz staying in office with undemocratic elections. Congress was Díaz's rubber stamp for legislation. Internal stability, sometimes called the Pax Porfiriana, was coupled with the increasing strength of the Mexican state, fueled by increased revenues from an expanding economy. Díaz replaced a number of independent regional leaders with men loyal to himself, and quelled discontent by coopting political \\"outs\\" by making them intermediaries with foreign investors, allowing their personal enrichment. To further consolidate state power, Díaz appointed jefes políticos (\\"political bosses\\") answerable to central government, who commanded local forces. The policies of conciliation, cooptation and repression allowed the regime to maintain order for decades.Katz, \\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato\\", pp. 81-83. In central Mexico, indigenous communities that had exercised political and economic control over their lands and populations were undermined by the Díaz regime through expropriation of lands and weakening or absence of indigenous leadership. Expropriation of village lands occurred as landed estates (haciendas), often owned by foreign investors, expanded. This process is known for the state of Morelos before the Mexican Revolution when Emiliano Zapata emerged as a leader in Anenecuilco to defend village lands and rights. Since the Díaz regime aimed to reconcile foreign investors and large estate owners, foreign and domestic, indigenous villages suffered politically and economically.Katz, \\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato\\", pp. 95–98Womack, John Jr. Zapata and the Mexican Revolution. New York: Vintage 1968. When Díaz came to power in 1876, the northern border of Mexico with the U.S. became a region of tension and conflict, which had to be resolved in order for Díaz's regime to be recognized as the sovereign government of Mexico. Indigenous groups and cattle thieves marauded in the border region. The Apache did not recognize the sovereignty of either the U.S. or Mexico over their territories, but used the international division to their advantage, raiding on one side of the border and seeking sanctuary on the other. Thieves stole cattle and likewise used the border to escape authorities. The U.S. used the border issue as a reason to withhold recognition of Díaz's regime and a low-level international conflict continued. The issue of recognition was finally resolved when Díaz's government granted generous concessions to prominent U.S. promoters of investment in Mexico, who pressured President Rutherford B. Hayes to grant recognition in 1878. It was clear to Díaz that order was to be maintained over all other considerations.Katz, \\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato\\", pp. 67–68 The turmoil of over a decade of war (1857–1867) and economic disruption gave rise to banditry. To combat this, during the administration of civilian president Benito Juárez, a small, efficient rural police force under his control, known as the Rurales, was a tool to impose order. When Díaz became president, he expanded the size and scope of the Rurales; they were under his command and control in a way the Mexican army was not. The slogan of the Porfiriato, “order and progress,” affirmed that without political order, economic development and growth—progress—was impossible. Investors would be unwilling to risk their capital if political conditions were unstable.Vanderwood, Paul J. Disorder and Progress: Bandits, Police, and Mexican Development. Revised edition. Wilmington DL: Scholarly Resources 1992.Coatsworth, John H. \\"Obstacles to Economic Growth in Nineteenth-Century Mexico,\\" American Historical Review vol. 83, No. 1 (Feb. 1978), pp. 80–100 The construction of railways gave the government more effective control of many regions of Mexico that had maintained a level of independence due to their distance from the capital. The construction of telegraph lines alongside railroad tracks further facilitated the government's control, so that orders from Mexico City were instantly transmitted to officials elsewhere. The government could respond quickly to regional revolts by loading armed Rurales and their horses on trains to quell disturbances. By the end of the 19th century, violence had almost completely disappeared. Philosophy Díaz himself was a pragmatic politician, but Mexican intellectuals sought to articulate a rationale for their form of liberalism. The advocates were called Científicos, \\"men of science.\\"Priego, Natalia. Positivism, Science, and 'The Scientists' in Porfirian Mexico. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press 2016. They found a basis for such a philosophy by crafting to Mexico French philosopher Auguste Comte’s Positivism and Herbert Spencer’s social Darwinism. Positivism sought to ground knowledge on observation and empirically-based knowledge rather than metaphysics or religious belief. In Mexico, liberal intellectuals believed that Mexico’s stability under Díaz was due to his strong government. In Social Darwinism and Positivism intellectuals saw the justification of their rule due to their superiority over a largely rural, largely indigenous and mixed-race (mestizo) Mexican population.Hale, Charles A. The Transformation of Liberalism in Late Nineteenth-Century Mexico. Princeton: Princeton University Press 1989.Bunker and Beezley, “Porfiriato: Interpretations”, p. 1170. Liberals sought to develop Mexico economically and sought to implement progress by an ideology promoting attitudes that were \\"nationalist, pro-capitalist, and moral tenets of thrift, hard work, entrepreneurialism, proper hygiene, and temperance.\\"Bunker and Beezley, \\"Porfiriato: Interpretations\\", p. 1170.Knight, Alan, The Mexican Revolution, vol. 2. Cambridge University Press 1986. Economy Guillermo Kahlo. Mexico at the beginning of the Porfiriato was a predominantly rural nation, with large estate owners controlling agricultural production for the local and regional food market. The largest groups of Mexicans involved in agriculture were small-scale ranchers and subsistence agriculturalists along with landless peasants tilling lands they did not own. Patterns of land ownership were shifting in the nineteenth century. The Liberal Reform had sought to eliminate corporate ownership of land, targeting estates owned by the Roman Catholic Church and indigenous communities, forcing them to be broken up into parcels and sold. Despite liberals’ hopes, this did not result in the creation of a class of yeoman farmers, but it did undermine the integrity of indigenous communities and undermine the economic power of the Church. Mexican National Railroad 1891 Construction of railway lines was a major factor in transforming the Mexican economy. Mexico is not endowed with a navigable river system that would have allowed for cheap water transport, and roads were often impassable during the rainy season, so the construction of railway lines overcame a major obstacle for Mexican economic development. The first line to be built was from the Gulf port of Veracruz to Mexico City, begun during the French intervention, but the rapid expansion of lines in central Mexico and northward to the U.S. border lowered transportation costs for passengers and freight, opened new regions, such as the Comarca Lagunera in northern Mexico, to agricultural development. The capital for railways as well as tracks and rolling stock were foreign. Investment in such capital demanding infrastructure is an indicator that foreign investors had confidence in Mexico’s stability. Construction of the railways was an effect of stability, but there was a significant decrease in banditry and other unrest because of the railways. The Rurales and their horses could be loaded on trains and dispatched to impose order.Coatsworth, John H. Growth Against Development: The Economic Impact of Railroads in Porfirian Mexico. DeKalb: University of Northern Illinois Press 1981.Coatsworth, John H. \\"Obstacles to Economic Growth in Nineteenth-Century Mexico,\\" American Historical Review vol. 83, No. 1 (Feb. 1978), pp. 80–100 Dos Estrellas mine, ca. 1905. Photo Abel Briquet Along with the construction of railways, telegraph lines were built next to the tracks. This allowed instant communication between capital and distant cities, increasing the power of the central Mexican state over distant regions. Dispatching Rurales quickly to troubled areas was a direct effect of more efficient communication. An industry that expanded significantly during this time was mining. In the colonial era, Mexico had mined and refined silver, minting silver coinage that became the first global currency. During the Porfiriato, mining of industrial minerals was the core of the industry. The world price of silver dropped in 1873, while at the same time economies in developed countries needed industrial minerals for their manufacturing. As with other aspects of the Mexican economy, the growth in the mining sector was predicated on the stability established by the government. The expansion of the railway network meant that ore could be transported cheaply and the telegraph network allowed investors to have efficient communications with the mining sites. Foreign investors, particularly from the U.S., had confidence in risking their capital in mining enterprises in Mexico. Mining enterprises for copper, lead, iron, and coal in Mexico’s north, especially Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango, Guanajuato and Coahuila, with Monterrey and Aguascalientes becoming especially prominent.Navarrete G., David. “Mining: 1821-1910” in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 919.Rankine, Margaret. “The Mexican Mining Industry with Special Reference to Guanajuato.” Bulletin of Latin American Research 11:1(1992). The development of industrial manufacturing aimed at a domestic market, primarily in textiles. Factories were built in urban areas by Mexican entrepreneurs in Orizaba and Guanajuato, which provided opportunities for workers to earn wages. These factories, many owned by French nationals, supplied domestic textile needs. Labor Rioters in front of the factory Río Blanco strike. Shoeing Mules (Mexican Village Scene).

Photo by Abel Briquet Craft artisan organizations already existed when Díaz came to power in 1876, as mutualist organizations or worker benevolent societies, and conducted strikes. The Gran Círculo de Obreros de México had nearly 30 branches in Mexico, calling for benefits beyond aiding of workers when they were sick, injured, or died. In 1875, the Congreso Obrero sought broader goals, including education for adult workers, compulsory education for children, and representation of their goals to authorities. The labor movement was not unified, including on whether to take political positions. During the late 1870s and early 1880s, journeyman artisans could no longer successfully aspire to being master artisans owning their own shop. Their discontent led to agitation, but the formation of combative industrial labor organizations in the later nineteenth century can be seen as roots of the modern labor movement in Mexico.Anderson, Rodney D. “Industrial Labor: 1876-1910” in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 681–2 After 1900, as Mexico’s economy was expanding dramatically with the infusion of foreign capital and the growth of various industries, organized industrial labor grew as well. Workers resisted mechanization of such industries as textiles, where owners sought higher productivity per worker. Strikes in cotton textile mills took place, with the Río Blanco strike being the best known. Railway workers were the best unionized in the late Porfiriatio, with some 50% of them being unionized. There was not a single union, but rather split along particular tasks, such as engineers and firemen. More highly skilled jobs were dominated by U.S. workers, and Mexican laborers were paid less for the same work. Mine workers also organized, with the Cananea Strike in 1906 the most widely known, since the mine was owned by U.S. interests and armed men from Arizona crossed into Mexico to suppress the strike. Although the Liberal Party of Mexico (PLM) advocated radical changes in favor of labor, most industrial workers were reformist not revolutionary. As the Díaz regime failed to respond to calls for reform, many workers saw regime change as desirable.Anderson, “Industrial Labor”, pp. 684–85 With the expansion of the railway network, workers could seek work far away from their homes. In Mexico City, the development of a streetcar system, initially mule-drawn cars, and later electric ones, allowed for mass transportation. Street car companies employed a variety of workers to build the tracks, maintain the cars and mules, and serve as conductors. Urban women were able to obtain office employment in both government and private enterprises. Although women’s presence in the home rather than working outside the home was a marker of middle class status, in the late nineteenth century respectable women were increasingly were employed outside the home as office workers. During the Liberal Reform in the mid-nineteenth century, women began entering the workforce as public school teachers and in charitable work. The Díaz regime opened opportunities for women as government office workers in the 1890s. The creation of a Mexican government bureaucracy largely staffed by women at the lower levels occurred in similar fashion to other nations as educated women dealt with the expansion of official paperwork and the introduction of new office technology of the typewriter, telephone, and telegraph. Women also engaged in certain types of manual labor, including factory work in paper mills, cotton textiles, chocolate, shoes, and hats.Porter, Susie S. From Angel to Office Worker: Middle Class Identity and Female Consciousness in Mexico, 1890-1950’’. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 2018, pp. 1–7 Social class, gender roles, citizenry Diaz's Vice President, Ramón Corral and family dressed in European-style fashions María Villa, purportedly a prostitute, shot her rival and was imprisoned for twenty years. “Dance of the 41”, José Guadalupe Posada, 1901 The increase of wealth due to the growth of export agriculture and industrialization largely benefited urban elites and foreigners, with the income and cultural gap with the poor widening. By far the largest sector of the Mexican population was rural and indigenous, with Mexico's cities, especially the capital, having the largest concentration of wealthy white elites. Peasant men tilled land that was generally owned by others, while peasant women raised children, cooked and cleaned. In the cities, plebeian women were domestic servants, workers in bakeries, and factories, while plebeian men pursued a whole variety of manual tasks. In central and southern Mexico, the state increasingly undermined the political structure of rule and the loss of community land had a significant impact, but traditional ways persisted, especially in places that produced for the regional rather than the export market. The liberal project sought to nurture a citizenry that adhered to civic virtues through improved public health, professional military training for men, a rehabilitative penal system, and secular public education. The state sought to replace traditional values based on religion and local loyalties with abstract principles shared by all citizens.Buffington, Robert and William E. French, \\"The Culture of Modernity\\" in The Oxford History of Mexico, Eds. Michael C. Meyer and William H. Beezley. New York: Oxford University Press 2000, pp. 401–07 The Porfiriato saw the growth of the urban middle class, with women entering the work force as teachers and office workers. Women's new roles not only added to household income but also contributed to major cultural changes as they shaped the identity of a middle-class household and as some became visible as activists for women’s rights.Porter, Susie S. From Angel to Office Worker: Middle Class Identity and Female Consciousness in Mexico, 1890-1950’’. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 2018, pp. 1–7 Middle class Mexican women began addressing gender inequality before the law, as well as other issues. Feminism in Mexico emerged during the Liberal Reform and Porfiriato, with adherents critiquing inequality in Mexican society, as happened elsewhere in the hemisphere and Western Europe. A few women formed all-women's groups to discuss issues of inequality, they founded literary journals, and attended international congresses on women's rights. Although there was some political pressure for women's suffrage in Mexico, it did not come to fruition until 1953.Miller, \\"Feminism and Feminist Organizations\\", p. 550 Although there was a societal shift in attitudes toward women’s roles, sexual diversity did not change as rapidly. Homosexuality remained clandestine and private in general. In November 1901, however, there was a public scandal about a police raid of a gathering of gay and cross-dressing men in Mexico City, known as the Dance of the Forty-One. Caricaturist José Guadalupe Posada made a broadside of the incident. Rumors abounded that the son-in-law of Porfirio Díaz was one of those arrested, but released. A list of those arrested was never published and the government neither confirmed nor denied.Barron Gavito, Miguel Ángel. “El baile de los 41: la representación de lo afeminado en la prensa porfiriana”.

ISSN 1405-0927 Education Justo Sierra, Díaz's Secretary of Education (1905-1911), who established the National University in Mexico Liberals created a secular educational system to counter the religious influence of the Roman Catholic Church. Public schools had been established during the period of Benito Juárez, but expanded during the Porfiriato after the defeat of the French monarchy and their Mexican Catholic allies.Chowning, Margaret. \\"Culture Wars in the Trenches? Public Schools and Catholic Education in Mexico, 1867-1897\\". Hispanic American Historical Review 97:4 (Nov. 2017), pp. 613–650. Schools did not just teach literacy and numeracy, but also aimed at creating a workforce guided by principles of punctuality, thrift, valuable work habits, and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco use, and gambling. Even so, illiteracy was widespread, with the 1910 census indicating only 33% of men and 27% of women were literate.Vaughan, Mary Kay. \\"Nationalizing the Countryside: Schools and Communities in the 1930s\\" in The Eagle and the Virgin: Nation and Cultural Revolution in Mexico, 1920-1940, Vaughan, Mary Kay and Stephen E. Lewis, eds. Durham: Duke University Press 2006, p. 158 However, the government's commitment to education under Justo Sierra was an important step, particularly in higher education with the establishment of the secular, state-controlled Universidad Nacional de México. The Pontifical University of Mexico, founded in the early sixteenth century under religious authority, was suppressed in 1865. Teaching school was one of the few honorable professions open to women. Urban, educated women school teachers were in the forefront of feminists in Mexico.Miller, Francesca. \\"Feminism and Feminist Organizations\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture. vol. 2, p. 550.

Photo Abel Briquet Canal de la Viga, Mexico City – photo by Abel Briquet Public health became an important issue for the Mexican government, which viewed a healthy population as important for economic development. Government investment in public health was seen as part of Mexico's overall project of modernization. In Mexico City, the government invested in large-scale infrastructure project to drain the central lake system, the desagüe in an attempt to prevent frequent flooding in the capital. Canals in Mexico City still had considerable boat traffic, such as on the Canal de la Viga, but canals were where sewage, trash, and animal carcasses were dumped. Access to potable water often meant drawing it from community fountains and distributed house to house by workmen with wheelbarrows or carrying containers on their backs. Some households were too poor to pay for the service, so a household member would draw and transport the water. Planners viewed inadequate drainage, sewage treatment, and lack of access to clean, potable water as solvable problems using scientific methods.Agostoni, Claudia.

Penal reform Blueprint of the Lecumberri Prison Mexico City's main jail was a former convent, Belem Prison, that was repurposed several times before becoming a prison for both women and men. It was filthy, poorly run, and a symbol of the order. Plans were drawn up for the construction of a new facility, a penitentiary designed to rehabilitate its prisoners. Designed as a panopticon based on plans by Jeremy Bentham, Lecumberri penitentiary was opened in 1900. Mexican officials were cognizant of changes in the idea of prison as well as newly focused on collecting crime statistics. Culture House of Tiles, Mexico City, site of the Jockey Club during the Porfiriato Posada mocks the style of elite men During the Porfiriato, urban Mexican elites became more cosmopolitan, with their consumer tastes for imported fashion styles and goods being considered an indicator of Mexico's modernity, with France being the embodiment of the sophistication they admired. Since the French had invaded Mexico and occupied it during the 1860s, Mexico's turn toward France was not without controversy in Mexico. France was a major European power and with the fall of Napoleon III in 1870, the way was opened to reestablish normal relations between the countries. With the resumption of diplomatic relations, Mexico enthusiastically embraced French styles. Department stores, such as the Palacio de Hierro, were modeled on those in Paris (Bon Marché) and London (Harrod's). French influence on culture in fashion, art, and architecture is evident in the capital and other major Mexican cities, with Mexican elites enthusiastic for French styles known as Afrancesados.Katz, \\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato,\\" p. 71.Bunker, Steven B. Creating Mexican Consumer Culture in the Age of Porfirio Díaz. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2012 La Calavera Catrina, José Guadalupe Posada mocks the style of elite Mexican women Satirical print by José Guadalupe Posada with bicyclists labeled with the names of Mexico City newspapers Among the elites, horse racing became popular and purpose-built race tracks were constructed, such as the Hippodrome of Peralvillo, built by the newly-formed Jockey Club. The club hired an architect who attended race events in Europe and the U.S. to design and build the track, which was to be opened on Easter Sunday 1882, a distinctly non-religious way to celebrate the holiday. At the delayed opening, the President of the Republic (1880–82), Manuel González, his cabinet, and the diplomatic corps, along with Mexicans who could afford the entry, watched horses owned by gentlemen compete for purses. The Jockey Club was founded in 1881, modeled on those in Europe. Mexico City's occupied the top floor of the eighteenth-century former residence of the Count of Orizaba known as the House of the Tiles. The club provided a place for elite social gatherings. Among the directors of the Jockey Club were Manuel Romero Rubio and José Yves Limantour, Díaz's closest advisors, and President González and Díaz himself as members. The Jockey Club had rooms for smoking, dining rooms, weapons, bowling, poker and baccarat.[\\"Casa de Azulejos\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20090822035832/http://www.sanborns.com.mx/sanborns/azulejos.asp#] accessed 10 May 2019Beezley, William H. Judas at the Jockey Club and other Episodes of Porfirian Mexico. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1987 There were upscale gambling houses that were regulated by the government. One was in the former Palace of the Emperor Iturbide, which in the late nineteenth century was a hotel. Entertainment among men of the urban popular classes included traditional sports of cockfighting and bullfighting. Bicycles were imported from Paris and Boston to Mexico City in 1869, just after the French Intervention. A French company imported bicycles and set up a rental business, but the sport took off when the technology improved in the 1890s with wheels of equal size and pneumatic tires. Bicycle clubs and organized races made their appearance soon after. Organized sports with rules, equality of competition, bureaucracy and formal record keeping became hallmarks of modernity. Although men dominated the sport, women also participated. For women especially, bicycling challenged traditional behavior, demeanor, and fashions, freeing them from being closely supervised shut-ins. Riding a bicycle required better women's clothing, and many adopted Bloomers for riding. In 1898, cartoon montage in the satirical publication El Hijo del Ahuizote answered the question \\"why go by bicycle?\\": for amusement, for pleasure in the streets, and one panel shows a bicycle on its side with a couple embracing, with the caption \\"for love.\\" Cycling was touted as promoting exercise and good hygiene and was associated with modernity, speed, and modernization through technology.Beezley, Judas at the Jockey Club, pp. 41–52.

The mid-nineteenth century had been riven by conflict between the Catholic Church and the liberal State. The liberals' Mexican Constitution of 1857 had established separation of church and state, and there were strong anti-clerical articles of the constitution. As a pragmatic politician, Díaz did not want to re-open outright conflict between his regime and the Catholic Church in Mexico and his marriage to Carmen Romero Rubio, who was a faithful Catholic, helped mend the rift. Díaz never had the anticlerical articles of the constitution repealed, but he did not strictly enforce them, so that the Catholic Church made a political and economic comeback during the Porfiriato. U.S. Protestant missionaries made inroads in Mexico during the Porfiriato, particularly in the north,Baldwin, Deborah J.

Urbana: University of Illinois Press 1990. but did not significantly challenge the power of Catholicism in Mexico.Katz,\\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato\\", pp. 86–87 In a number of regions of Mexico, local religious cults and dissident peasant movements arose, which the Catholic Church considered idolatrous. Responding to the potential loss of the faithful in Mexico and elsewhere, Pope Leo XIII issued the encyclical Rerum Novarum, calling on the Church to become involved in social problems. In Mexico, some Catholic laymen supported the abolition of debt peonage on landed estates, which kept peasants tied to work there because they were unable to pay off their debts. The Church itself had lost lands during the Liberal Reform in the mid-nineteenth century, so it could voice support for the peasants' plight. The Church's success in the new initiatives can be seen as Zapatistas in Morelos carried out no anticlerical actions during the Mexican Revolution,Katz, \\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato\\", pp. 86-87 and many fighters wore the Virgin of Guadalupe on their hats. Historical memory National Museum of Anthropology with the Aztec sun stone. It was previously on display in the open air, up against the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral wall. During the Díaz regime, the state began to take control over the cultural patrimony of Mexico, expanding the National Museum of Anthropology as the central repository of artifacts from Mexico's archeological sites, as well as asserting control over the sites themselves. The Law of Monuments (1897) gave jurisdiction over archeological sites to the federal government. This allowed the expropriation and expulsion of peasants who had been cultivating crops on the archeological sites, most systematically done at Teotihuacan. Former cavalry officer and archeologist Leopoldo Batres was Inspector of Archeological Monuments and wielded considerable power. He garnered resources from the Díaz government funds to guard archeological sites in central Mexico and Yucatan, as well as to hire workers to excavate archeological sites of particular importance for creating an image of Mexico's glorious past to foreign scholars and tourists, as well as patriotic fervor in Mexico.Bueno, Christina The Pursuit of Ruins: Archeology, History, and the Making of Modern Mexico.

Along the wide, tree-lined boulevard, Paseo de la Reforma, laid out by Emperor Maximilian between the National Palace and Chapultepec Castle, was transformed as a site of historical memory, with statues commemorating figures of Mexican history and important historical events. 1910 Centennial of Independence Illustrated program of the official centennial festivities over 30 days in September 1910 Porfirio Díaz and his second wife Carmen Romero Rubio photographed with others celebrating the centennial of Mexican independence in 1910 The official centennial festivities were concentrated in the month of September, but there were events during the centennial year outside of September. In September the central core of Mexico city was decorated and lit with electric lights many bedecked with flowers. Immediately following the centennial month, there was a book published, detailing the day by day events of the festivities, which included inaugurations of buildings and statues, receptions for dignitaries, military parades, and allegorical and historical processions.Díaz Flores Alatorre, Manuel. Recuerdo del Primer Centenario de la Independencia Nacional: Efemérides de las fiestas, recepciones, actos políticos, inauguraciones de monumentos, y de edificios, etc.. Mexico City: Rondero y Treppiedi 1910. The material below unless otherwise indicated is taken from this unpaginated work. The high points of the celebrations were on 15 September, Diaz's 80th birthday, and 16 September, the centennial of Hidalgo's Grito de Dolores, considered the starting point of Mexico's struggle for independence in 1810. On Friday, 15 September, the day was marked by a huge parade representing the arc of Mexican history, focusing on the 1519 conquest of Mexico, the struggle for independence in the early nineteenth century, and the liberal reform of the mid-nineteenth century. There were allegorical floats depicting the insurgent army of independence, independence martyr Father José María Morelos, and for the modern era commerce, industry, and banking. At 11 p.m. Diaz stood on the balcony of the National Palace and with the ringing of the bell from Father Hidalgo's church in Dolores, Diaz proclaimed \\"Viva Mexico.\\". On 16 September, Diaz with an array of dignitaries attending inaugurated, the Monument to Independence at a major intersection (glorieta) of Paseo de la Reforma. Some 10,000 Mexican troops and contingents of foreign soldiers marched at the monument as part of the inaugural ceremonies. Another major September activity included Díaz's inauguration on 18 September of the monument to Benito Juárez at the edge of the Alameda Park. Although a political rival in life, Diaz helped memorialize Juárez's contributions to Mexico. At the ceremony, the French ambassador returned the ceremonial keys of Mexico City that were given to General Forey in 1863 during the French Intervention. The French invasion had disrupted Juárez's presidency, forcing his government into domestic exile while the French occupied Mexico. He inaugurated a new insane asylum in Mixcoac on the first of September. On 2 September, the pillar of the baptismal font in Hidalgo's church was brought to the capital with great ceremony and placed in the National Museum, with some 25,000 children viewing the event. Many nations participated in the celebrations, including Japan, whose pavilion Díaz inaugurated. An important issue for the modernizing Mexican state was health and hygiene, and an exhibition was inaugurated on September 2. Díaz's Minister of the Interior, Ramón Corral ceremonially laid the first stone of a new penitentiary. On Sunday, September 4, there was a parade with allegorical floats, which Díaz and his whole cabinet viewed. On September 6 some 38,000 school children honored the Mexican flag. Diaz inaugurated the new building of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Mexico City, a Protestant voluntary association. A new normal school to train teachers was inaugurated with Diaz and foreign delegates attending. Also occurring during the festivities was the Nation Congress of Pedagogy. The Spanish monarchy sent a special ambassador to the festivities, who was enthusiastically received. Diaz gave an enormous reception in his honor. On 9 September Díaz laid the first stone on a monument to Isabel the Catholic and Díaz also opened an exhibition of colonial-era Spanish art. The Spanish ambassador, the Marquis of Polavieja returned items of historical importance to Mexico, including the uniform of Father Morelos, a portrait, and other relics of independence in a ceremony at the National Palace, with the diplomatic corps in attendance, as well as Mexican army officers. The king of Spain conveyed through his special ambassador the honor of the Order of Charles III on Diaz, the highest distinction for sovereigns and heads of state. Others holding the honor were the Russian czar, and the monarchs of Germany and Austria. A portrait of Spanish monarch Charles III was unveiled in the Salon of Ambassadors in the National Palace. The International Congress of Americanists met in Mexico City, with Porfirio Díaz elected its honorary president. Prominent Americanists from many countries attended, including Eduard Seler from Germany and Franz Boaz from the U.S. Mexican Secretary of Education, Justo Sierra attended. Diaz and Justo Sierra went with Congress attendees went to the archeological site of San Juan Teotihuacan. As part of the historical commemorations of the centennial, on September 8 there was homage paid to the Niños Héroes, the cadets who died defending Chapultepec Castle from the invading U.S. forces during the Mexican–American War. But Diaz also laid the first stone to a monument to George Washington in the American Colony in Mexico City. The U.S. delegation hosted a sumptuous banquet for fellow delegates. There was a large number of journalists from the U.S. attending the celebrations, such as The New York Times, the New York Evening Post, Harper's Weekly, The Washington Post, as well as some from Toronto and Montreal in Canada, with the U.S. ambassador hosting a reception for these North American newspapermen. Other statues that were inaugurated were one honoring France's Louis Pasteur and Germany's Alexander von Humboldt. The German government had an honor guard for the monument of German naval officers. End of the Porfiriato, 1910–11 The centenary celebrations were the swansong of Díaz’s regime. Presidential-challenger Francisco I. Madero had been jailed during the 1910 presidential elections, but he escaped north across the U.S. border in Texas. While still in Mexico, he issued the Plan of San Luis Potosí in October 1910, which denounced the election as fraudulent and called for a rebellion against what he considered Díaz’s illegitimate regime. Fighting broke out in the state of Morelos, just south of Mexico City, as well as on the border with the U.S. in Ciudad Juárez. The Mexican Federal Army was incapable of putting down these disparate uprisings. Opposition to Díaz grew, since his regime was not able to restore civil order. Díaz had failed to secure the presidential succession. Political rivals, General Bernardo Reyes, who had a fiefdom in northern Mexico encompassing Coahuila, Tamaulipas, and Nuevo León, and Minister of Finance and leader of the Científicos, José Yves Limantour, were shut of the succession, with Díaz choosing Ramón Corral as his vice president. Reyes accepted exile and went to Europe, on a mission to study the military in Germany. Although Reyes had been a political rival, according to one historian, exiling him was a serious political miscalculation, since he was loyal and effective and the political opposition was growing, adding to the anti-reelectionists.Garner, Paul. Porfirio Díaz. New York: Longman 2001, pp.217-18 Limantour was in Europe as well, renegotiating Mexico’s debt, leaving Díaz increasingly isolated politically. Díaz began negotiating with Madero’s uncle Ernesto Madero, promising reforms if peace were restored. He also began informal negotiations with anti-reelectionist rebels in early 1911. Díaz refused to resign, which re-ignited the armed rebellion against him, particularly in Chihuahua led by Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa. Faced with this situation, Díaz agreed to the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez, which largely left the Porfirian state intact.Katz, Friedrich, The Life and Times of Pancho Villa. Stanford: Stanford University Press pp. 104-119 The treaty specified that Diaz resign along with vice president Corral, and created an interim regime under Francisco León de la Barra in advance of new elections. Rebel forces were to demobilize. Díaz and most of his family sailed to France into exile. He died in Paris in 1915. As he left Mexico, he reportedly prophesized that “Madero has released a tiger, let us see if he can control it.”Garner, Porfirio Díaz, p. 220.

It was first released as a single in 1991, but did not become a hit until four years later, when the Los Angeles radio station KROQ began adding it into their playlists and it quickly became one of their most requested songs. Lyrics and meaning The song is about a woman who gets date raped by a man who in return gets anally raped while in prison. Background Bradley Nowell explained, > \\"I've never raped anyone at least as far as I can remember. We were at a > party a long time ago and we were all talking about how much date rape > sucked. This guy was like, \\"Date rape isn't so bad; if it wasn't for date > rape I'd never get laid.\\" Everyone at the party was bummed out about it, but > I was cracking up and I wrote a funny song about it.\\" Although \\"Date Rape\\" is one of Sublime's most popular songs, it barely made it on their first CD. Nowell and the other members of the band thought of it as one of their worst songs, often being reluctant to play it during live shows when fans screamed out requests for it. Music video Pornographic actor Ron Jeremy stars in the \\"Date Rape\\" music video. Jeremy plays both the judge at the rape trial and the \\"large inmate\\" who rapes the man who sexually assaulted the female protagonist of the song. Legacy The song was covered by Fishbone (whom Sublime cited as an influence) on both the 2005 Sublime tribute album Look at All the Love We Found and Fishbone's own 2006 album Still Stuck in Your Throat. The cover's video was directed by Renee Tod and Josh Fischel (of the band Bargain Music), the latter of which is the director of the Sublime documentary Stories, Tales, Lies & Exaggerations. \\"Date Rape\\" is also featured in the soundtrack for the video game BMX XXX.

He joined the ministry of the Congregational Church at Newport, Rhode Island, on April 11, 1728, in opposition to the wishes of Mr. Clap, who was pastor there. Clap's friends formed a new society, and Adams was dismissed in about two years. He was distinguished for his intellect and piety. As a preacher he was much esteemed. His uncle, Matthew Adams, described him as \\"master of nine languages,\\" and claimed that he was conversant with the most famous Greek, Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish authors, as well as with the noblest English writers. He also speaks of his nephew's \\"great and undissembled piety, which ran, like a vein of gold, through all his life and performances.\\" Adams published a sermon on his ordination, 1728, and a poem on the love of money.

It remains one of the composer's more popular orchestral works to this day. Composition and premiere 1875 was a fruitful year for Dvořák, during which he wrote his Symphony No. 5, String Quintet No. 2, Piano Trio No. 1, the opera Vanda, and the Moravian Duets. These were happy times in his life. His marriage was young, and his first son had been born. For the first time in his life, he was being recognized as a composer and without fear of poverty. He received a generous stipend from a commission in Vienna, which allowed him to compose his Fifth Symphony and several chamber works as well as the Serenade. Dvořák is said to have written the Serenade in just 12 days, from 3 to 14 May. The piece was premiered in Prague on 10 December 1876 by Adolf Čech and the combined orchestras of the Czech and German theatres. It was published in 1877 in the composer's piano duet arrangement by Emanuel Starý in Prague. The score was printed two years later by Bote and Bock, Berlin. Form Dvořák's Serenade for Strings consists of five movements: With the exception of the finale, which is in modified sonata form, each movement follows a rough ABA form. It is believed that Dvořák took up this small orchestral genre because it was less demanding than the symphony, but allowed for the provision of pleasure and entertainment. The piece combines cantabile style (first movement), a slow waltz (second movement), humorous high spirits (third movement), lyrical beauty (fourth movement) and exuberance (fifth movement).Doge, Klaus. \\"Dvorak, Antonin\\". Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 23 November 2009. Scoring The work is scored for full string orchestra, with staves for Violin I & 2, Viola, Cello and Contrabass (double bass). It is typically performed with 4–6 instruments per part, though usually 2 or 3 double basses are sufficient. Description of movements I. Moderato The first movement starts off the Serenade in the key of E major. The second violins and cellos introduce the lyrical main theme over an eighth note pulse in the violas. The theme is traded back and forth, and the second violins reprise it under a soaring passage in the firsts. At measure 31, the movement modulates into G major and presents a new, dancelike theme, based on a dotted rhythm. At measure 54, the movement modulates back into E major and the primary theme returns. The movement ends on three E major chords. II. Tempo di Valse The second movement, a waltz, opens with a lilting dance melody in C minor. The first section repeats, and the second section begins in E Mixolydian. A string of eighth notes in the violins transitions into the second theme in A major. The first theme returns, and Part A is closed with a cadential fortissimo C-sharp minor chord. Part B opens with a modulation into the enharmonic parallel major of D major. This section's theme is developed, and then Part A returns. The movement ends on a C major chord. III. Scherzo: Vivace The third movement is a lively, hyperactive Scherzo in F major. The theme is stated and subsequently developed in sections of different tempos and moods, including a foray into A major. The most monothematic movement yet, the scherzo ends with a coda combining material from the scherzo and trio. IV. Larghetto The slow movement of the Serenade is tranquil and wistful. Its flowing melodies and tender phrases form a buffer between the vigorous third and fifth movements. The third theme of the second movement is quoted repeatedly throughout. V. Finale: Allegro vivace The fifth movement is a lively, offbeat finale, conveying the spirit of a Bohemian village dance. The principal theme is a descending figure based on thirds with accents on weak beats. More thematic material enters at bar 32 as the violins and cellos trade calls and responses over running eighths in the violas. A third theme based primarily on sixteenth-note upbeats appears at bar 87. A wistful recollection of the melody from the preceding Larghetto appears and then diminuendos away. The movement's recapitulation starts with the main theme, followed in turn by the second and third themes. A 20-bar eighth-note passage leads into a quotation of the first movement's theme, bringing the piece full circle. A Presto coda follows, and the Serenade ends with three E major chords.

Vehicles were primarily produced for the US, Canadian, and Mexican markets, but they also built exports for various countries around the world, particularly South America and the Middle East. Historically the Oshawa plant was the source of all right-hand-drive market GM exports with complete vehicles or knock-down kits shipped to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom until the end of the 1960s. At one time, the factory was one of the largest auto manufacturing facilities in the world, with two car assembly plants, a truck assembly plant, as well as parts production including Harrison radiators, AC Delco batteries (for both GM and other vehicle manufacturers) and American Axle. Between 1999 and 2019, it had won more quality and productivity awards than any other GM plant. The plant is part of the larger GM Autoplex. The facility has over 10 million square feet (930,000 m²) of vacant factory floor. It was converted to a state of the art flexible manufacturing facility in 2008, which involved the consolidation of two car plants under the same roof and the addition of a $1.3B paint shop which can accommodate 27 different body styles, including cars, pick up trucks and vans. Approximately 3,600 hourly and 400 salaried employees were working at the plant, with many more engineers working at GM's Regional Engineering Centre across the road. The hourly-rated workers were represented by their union, Unifor Local 222. In August 2017, it was rated highly by its employees in The Best Places to Work in Canada rankings by Indeed, garnering 4th spot overall, and 1st for wages and benefits. On November 26, 2018, GM announced that production of new cars at Oshawa would wind down in 2019 and cease by the end of the year. The closure will be affecting 2,500 union workers and 300 management. On May 8, 2019 GM announced they would be spending $170 million (CAD) to transition the plant from vehicle assembly to the production of body stampings and other subassemblies, and would convert 22 hectares (220,000 m²) of the facility to a test track for the development of autonomous vehicles. History The facility had produced vehicles since 1907. It was one of six locations building Chevrolet before it merged with GM in 1918. In January 1918, Oshawa became the first Canadian GM plant to minimize the issue of large scale layoffs by cutting the second shift and alternating day- and night-shift workers at two-week intervals. This system was later adopted at other plants around the continent. From its beginnings, the Oshawa plant supplied right-hand-drive vehicles to international markets in kit form for local assembly, or as completed vehicles until the late 1960s. International markets saw U.S and Canadian-only GM vehicles such as the Bel Air, Pontiac Parisienne, Pontiac Laurentian, and Chevrolet Impala. In the mid-1980s, GM began a large transformation of the facility, naming the site \\"Autoplex.\\" The changeover came in three steps, the first being conversion of the truck plant to GMT400 production in 1986. The next step was retooling Line 2 for the new W-body Regal, which began production in mid-1987. The final instalment was a long changeover of Line 1 for the Chevrolet Lumina, which went into production on January 8, 1989 as a 1990 model. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo and Pontiac Grand Prix were discontinued in June and November 2007 respectively. The Buick LaCrosse was discontinued from Oshawa #2 in 2008 and moved to Fairfax Assembly for 2009. In the fourth quarter of that year, it began producing the new Chevrolet Camaro. Both the Buick Regal and the Camaro Convertible launched on the Flex Line in the first quarter of 2011. The plant began the production of high performance 2012 Camaro ZL1 and the 2012 Buick Regal GS in 2012 and will build the 2013 Cadillac XTS in the first quarter of 2012. The Cadillac XTS was a product of Oshawa Car Assembly In August 2010, the plant began assembling the Chevrolet Equinox in partnership with another GM facility in Ingersoll, Ontario, known as CAMI Automotive. The metal bodies are made at CAMI, trucked two hours east to Oshawa, where they are inserted on the conveyor just before the paint shop. The bodies are painted and then go through the general assembly process at the Oshawa plant. The entire process was developed as a quick way to respond to high demand for the Equinox product. The CAMI facility does make Equinox and GMC Terrain from start to finish at their own plant, but they did not have the capacity to put more bodies through paint and general assembly. In mid 2018, it was announced that the previous generation of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and the GMC Sierra 1500 would be sold alongside their successors for the 2019 model year, as the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LD and the GMC Sierra 1500 Limited. Final assembly of these trucks, which would only be sold in Double Cab, Standard Bed form, would occur at Oshawa Car Assembly. This marks the first time since 2009 that Oshawa Assembly (Oshawa Truck Assembly), which also assembled the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and the GMC Sierra 1500 in Extended Cab form, would assemble trucks. Later that summer, GM also began final assembly of Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD Double Cab models.https://www.autotrader.ca/newsfeatures/20181106/gm-oshawa-pickup- production-expected-to-run-to-late-2019/ On November 26, 2018, General Motors announced the closure of the Oshawa car assembly plant complex ending 111 years of auto manufacturing in Oshawa. The final vehicle, a white GMC Sierra pickup truck, rolled off the assembly line on December 18, 2019.https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/century-of-automaking- last-gm-truck-rolls-off-oshawa-production-line Awards The plant won the J.D. Power Gold Award for initial quality in 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006; as well a numerous other individual awards for the specific models it produces. In 2007, the plant won silver for initial quality, and a Gold Best in Segment award for the Pontiac Grand Prix, and Bronze Best in Segment for the Monte Carlo. In all, the plant has won 19 J.D. Power awards for quality since 1999. In recognition of that achievement, J.D. Power awarded the Founder's Award to the Car Plant in the summer of 2008; it is an award that has been presented only six times in the lengthy history of J.D. Power & Associates. Harbour Consulting rated Oshawa #1 (building the Impala and Monte Carlo) as the second most efficient in North America, the top-rated in the study was Oshawa #2 (building the LaCrosse and Grand Prix).

It was established in 1952 to represent workers on the basis of \\"Christian social principles\\". The union claims that its approach to labour relations develops workers' sense of responsibility, participation, stewardship, and dignity. It opposes what it calls the undemocratic, adversarial, and monopolistic practices of the labour movement. History Formation A group of Canadians, many of whom were Dutch immigrants who came to Canada after World War II, decided to form a union with principles of dignity, justice, stewardship, and respect, and allowed freedom of association. Those immigrants were accustomed to the European model of labour relations, with freedom of association allowed from a variety of unions to choose from. In Canada, however, people who disagreed with the policies of their union had no option to opt out of the union of their workplace, other than to work in a non- unionized shop. Many non-unionized shops had lower safety and wage standards than unionized shops. A group of those immigrants met on numerous occasions in the early 1950s, and on February 20, 1952, the Christian Labour Association (CLAC) was founded. Frans Fuykschot was appointed the general secretary of CLAC and opened the union's first office, in Hamilton, Ontario. Soon afterwards, the first issue of The Guide, the official CLAC magazine, was published. Although the founders of CLAC were Christian and wanted their union to be based on Christian social principles, they did not require members to be Christian. Within two years, CLAC started applying for its first certifications. Early struggles In 1954 CLAC applied for certifications in British Columbia (BC) and Ontario. The BC Labour Relations Board granted certification to a CLAC local, but the Ontario Labour Relations Board denied certification because of a technicality. However, the Board expressed its concern with the fact that CLAC was based on Christian principles and believed that it would discriminate against non-Christian workers. After CLAC was granted certification in BC, the AFL–CIO, a labour federation based in the US, threatened CLAC publicly and took job action against CLAC members. Because of the Ontario Labour Board's decision that CLAC's constitution was discriminatory, BC later refused CLAC's recertification application. CLAC repeatedly tried to gain certification in Ontario and was repeatedly denied on the basis of being discriminatory. In 1959, the union updated their constitution to state specifically that members and applicants did not have to accept the Christian values on which the union was based and that applicants would not be discriminated against for their religion. CLAC came into conflict with other unions. Workers who were known to be affiliated with CLAC were often harassed and intimidated by members of other unions. Other unions told their members to stop working as soon as CLAC members showed up on a job site. The pressure from outside the organization led to internal pressures. Some members wanted to take out the language in the constitution that stated that CLAC was based on Christian principles (Article 2). Those arguments led the union to split in 1958, with Fuykschot and several others leaving to establish a new union, the Christian Trade Unions of Canada. The CTUC did not refer to the Bible as its basis in its constitution. The CTUC quickly received certification. Certification: 1963 Frustrated by the Ontario Labour Board's repeated refusal to recognize CLAC locals, CLAC applied for a judicial review by the Ontario Supreme Court of the refusal to grant certification to CLAC Local 52. In 1963, Chief Justice McRuer issued a decision, disagreeing with the Labour Board's refusal to certify CLAC and saying that the Board had erred in three ways. One was in allowing old, irrelevant evidence to be used in making its decision. Another was in misinterpreting the anti-discriminatory statute, thus misapplying it to CLAC. Finally, CLAC certification had been denied without any legal basis.Court Decisions—Cited 63 CLLC: Trenton Workers Assoc. v. Tange in Canadian Labour Law Cases vol. 2 1960-1964 (Canada: CCH Canadian Limited, 1964), 655. Justice McRuer found that neither CLAC's constitution nor its practices were discriminatory. He ordered the Board's decision to be quashed and so CLAC gained the right to certify locals. Practices and policies In negotiating wages and benefits for its members, the CLAC considers the \\"economic viability of the enterprise.\\" The association supports the open shop as an expression of the principle of free association and as a balance between individual and collective interests. It represents more than 58,000 workers under some 550 collective agreements across Canada; more than 15,000 of its workers are in Alberta. The membership is concentrated in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan, in sectors such as construction, social services, healthcare, emergency services, transportation, retail, education, hospitality, and manufacturing. The CLAC's members fund a variety of benefit programs such as health and disability insurance, pension and retirement plans, apprenticeship subsidies, training grants, layoff assistance, and a strike fund. The association operates training centres in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan, which are funded by negotiated education and training funds. The CLAC has about 200 full-time staff working from 12 regional offices, two benefit administration offices, and its training centres. The Guide, the CLAC's official magazine, is published four times per year.The Guide The CLAC is not affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC). Furthermore, it was suspended from the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), a global labour organization with affiliates comprising 175 million workers around the world, after the ITUC concluded that \\"by its published policy and by its activity CLAC indeed undermines labour conditions of workers.\\"http://www.boilermaker.ca/news/Oct-21-11/Oct-21-11.htm CLAC disputed ITUC's reasons for the suspension and noted that it has been certified over 2,000 times by labour boards across Canada. The Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan rejected allegations that CLAC is a \\"company dominated organization.\\" The suspension came at the request of the CLC, whose affiliated unions compete with the CLAC, and Ken Georgetti, the CLC president, who was also a Vice-President and member of the Executive Board of the ITUC. The CLAC was not granted a hearing before the ITUC's General Council. At its National Convention on September 14, 2012, CLAC delegates voted to resign from the ITUC and join the World Organization of Workers (WOW). The CLAC joined the ITUC in 2006 as a founding member but no longer believes that the ITUC respects union pluralism or workers' right to freedom of association and so it cannot be a reliable partner for international justice for workers. Services Training CLAC operates training centres in BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario. Through the centres, it provides many different types of courses, from industry-specific courses to general courses. CLAC also sends trainers to work sites for company-specific training and operates computer- based courses. It offers scholarships, bursaries, and apprenticeship bursaries. Career services CLAC provides career services to help workers find work and employers find workers. It runs the service for members and non- members from its offices in Alberta, BC, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. Retirement Plans CLAC runs two retirement savings plans: a pension plan and a Group RSP. The pension plan was established in 1974 and is available for members across Canada. It is a registered defined contribution plan, which means that contributions are made every month and vested directly in the member. Employers do not have access to the pension fund. The fund is overseen by a Board of Trustees, invested by outside professionals, and audited by an accounting firm. The Group RSP is run through Great-West Life and is available to members only in Western Canada. Benefits CLAC offers numerous group benefit plans, which are run through the Health and Welfare Trust Fund. There are two Benefit Administration offices. Western benefits are handled out of Edmonton, Alberta, Eastern benefits are handled out of Grimsby, Ontario. The health and welfare benefits provide coverage for needs such as vision, dental, and prescription drugs; life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance; and an employee and family assistance program to help with personal difficulties. Coverage levels vary between collective agreements. The providers include Standard Life, Sun Life, RBC Insurance, AIG, Green shield, and Ceridian Lifeworks. CLAC Wellness CLAC provides a workplace wellness program to members who have it negotiated in their collective agreement. The program was founded in 2009 in BC and is slowly expanding into other provinces in which CLAC represents workers. Criticism Some trade unions allege that employers are voluntarily quick to recognize the CLAC because of its willingness to undercut industry-standard wages and working conditions, which other unions have struggled to improve. According to a report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a Canadian based think-tank , CLAC has helped employers in British Columbia circumvent the Employment Standards Act by agreeing to contracts that provide less than the minimums afforded by law because a provision of the Act is that it does not apply to workers represented by a union. CLAC is regarded by international trade organizations as a danger to labour unions and a threat to collective action to the benefit of workers. Trade unions often allege that the CLAC is a company union and that many of its provisions are company-oriented and deceptive to workers. CLAC, in response, takes the position that \\"traditional\\" unions are to blame for the attacks on themselves. International work CLAC Foundation CLAC has been providing financial aid to workers around the world for 25 through its solidarity locals, which are made up of CLAC by members who are not directly represented by the union but believe in the work that it does. Through the CLAC Foundation, the efforts and ability to aid struggling workers and their families have been expanded. Now, CLAC, its members, signatory companies, and the general public can donate to various causes through the foundation. Projects include providing training for tradespeople in areas hit by natural disasters, supporting the China Labour Bulletin, helping workers in Canada prepare to re-enter the workforce, and raising awareness about the issues affecting workers around the world.

It is included in the Elizabethtown, Kentucky Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Railroad Once named Walker's Station for Lewis B. Walker's store, when a post office was established on March 2, 1859. Lewis B. Walker was the first postmaster. It was named Glendale for the new train station, which in turn was possibly named for the hometown of a railroad employee. A train depot was built in Glendale along the L & N Railroad tracks in 1864. It was remodeled into a \\"combination station\\" in 1905 and the old station became a freight room with two waiting rooms for passengers and an agent's office. The original depot was torn down in the 1930s. The passage of the train is still a familiar sound and site in Glendale. Those who grew up in Glendale can remember the train coming through to pick up and drop off mail. As the train passed slowly through town, the person in charge of mail on the train would throw out a large bag of mail for the Glendale postmaster to pick up. For outgoing mail, the Glendale postmaster would hang a mailbag known as a \\"catcher pouch\\" on a \\"mail hook\\", located next to the train tracks, before the train's scheduled arrival. The catcher pouch was grabbed by a catcher mechanism (mechanical arm) as the train passed by. This was known as \\"mail on the fly\\" because the train could deliver and receive mail without stopping. Legend has it that Jesse James once robbed the Glendale bank. Education Glendale once had a college known as Lynnland. In 1867 a charter was issued under the name of Lynnland Female Institute. The school opened in September of the same year under the guidance of a Baptist preacher, Rev. Colson. After two years of operation, the college was taken over by Confederate Brigadier General William F. Perry. The school was then converted into Lynnland Military Institution which operated until 1879. From 1879 until 1888 it became the residence of the Samuel Sprigg family. In 1888, it reopened as Lynnland Female Institute until it was sold to the Kentucky Baptist Education Society in 1905. In 1915, it became the Kentucky Baptist Children's Home. Many Glendaleans knew it as the Glendale Children's Home until it officially closed in 2009. Many outstanding young men and women came through the Glendale Children's Home where they received loving care by those who lived and worked there. They attended Gilead Baptist Church (organized 1824) which was located nearby. The children also attended school at Glendale Elementary and High School. Glendale became East Hardin Elementary and High School in 1964. East Hardin Elementary was shut down in 1971 as East Hardin High continued to operate. East Hardin High School was converted into East Hardin Middle School in the 1990s and continues to operate today. East Hardin High School (Rebels) consolidated with its Stephensburg, Kentucky rival school West Hardin High School (Lakers) to form Central Hardin High School (Bruins). First to Organize for Kentucky Women's Rights Glendale was the site of the first organized woman suffrage association in Kentucky. Mary Barr Clay included in her summary of Kentucky women's suffrage activities in the History of Woman Suffrage included a report given in The Revolution from Glendale: \\"We organized here an association with twenty members the first of October, 1867, and now have fifty. We hope soon to have the whole of Hardin county, and by the close of another year the whole of the State of Kentucky, enlisted on the side of woman's rights.\\" Cultural Events and Food  Glendale is host to the annual Glendale Crossing Festival on the third Saturday of October. The festival is well known for the wide variety of antiques and crafts for sale. The Whistle Stop is the most famous restaurant in Glendale and is situated along the rail road. The Whistle Stop was created from expanding a lunch business within the existing hardware store in Glendale. The owners, James and Idell Sego, opened the restaurant in 1975. In 2005, this restaurant obtained new owners, Mike and Lynn Cummins. They continue to operate it to this day. Glendale has a special zoning regulation that keeps out businesses such as fast food restaurant chains from its core downtown business area. Glendale is located approximately from one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Mammoth Cave National Park. Economy In April 2009, Gov. Steve Beshear announced that a consortium of least 50 corporations — collectively known as the National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Batteries, or NAATBatt — identified a state-owned industrial site, for a project to bring a lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant for hybrid and electric cars, its headquarters and engineering facilities to Glendale. The project was expected to take 18 months, and potentially employing 1,500-2,000 people. * Federal government deals blow to Hardin project Federal stimulus funds from the Department of Energy were a prerequisite for this project going forward. Alternate plans and financing are being considered. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Glendale has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Glendale, Kentucky References External links * CHARGING INTO THE GREEN ECONOMY - June 2009 Category:Unincorporated communities in Kentucky Category:Unincorporated communities in Hardin County, Kentucky Category:Elizabethtown metropolitan area ","title":"Glendale, Kentucky"},{"id":"4508488","title":"Vikram Bhatnagar"},{"id":"4508490","text":"This is a list of several past and present personalities on the ESPNews network.ESPNtv.com - The People (NOTE: All of the current ESPNews anchors listed below are now SportsCenter anchors as of June 2013.)

The ship was found inoperable and with no crew on board and a broken tow rope, with identifying marks removed, but no signs of illegal activity or violence. The coast guard was never able to determine the ship's origins and scuttled it in deep waters. Apprehension Photographs of the ship were taken and analysed at the Australian Customs Service, which dispatched a patrol boat immediately. The Australian Customs vessel Storm Bay arrived during the night and waited until morning before launching a tender to board the vessel, which was drifting in uncharted waters. There was no sign of recent human activity found aboard, nor any signs that it had been engaged in illegal activity such as poaching or people smuggling. A spokesman for Australian Customs addressed the newsmedia on 24 March 2006 stating that although they had been unable to obtain documentary evidence of its registration or origin port, materials recovered seemed to indicate the vessel was called the Jian Seng, though the name and identifying features had been painted over. A large quantity of rice was found on board, leading the boarding party to believe the vessel had probably been used as a resupply ship for fishing boats with food and fuel in waters outside the Australian exclusive economic zone and which had broken tow and drifted to its current position. The boarding party asserted that the vessel had been adrift for an exceptionally long time before being found, and that the engines were inoperable and incapable of being restarted. They also reported that the boat was drifting slowly southwards. It had been extensively stripped, suggesting that it may have been on its way to a scrapyard when its towline broke. The Storm Bay monitored Jian Seng for several days before a decision was made to tow it to the nearest harbour. A salvage tug towed the ship to Weipa, on Cape York, where oily water which posed an environmental hazard was removed. Since no owner of the ship could ever be located, it was towed to deep water on 21 April 2006 and scuttled.  Political implications  Chris Ellison, Minister for Justice and Customs, claimed that the detection of this vessel illustrates the effectiveness of response in detection of ships breaching Australian borders, alleging it was detected in a remote stretch of Australian waters and photographed by a Customs airplane, which returned to base with the photos whilst a vessel was immediately dispatched. This was challenged by Senator Joseph William Ludwig, claiming that the extraordinary feat was the fact that it was not intercepted earlier, when one considers how far south it had entered into the gulf. The area in which it was found is notorious for illegal Indonesian fishing vessels and for people or drug smuggling operations. Senator Ludwig alleged that Australian Customs had claimed this was a region they had specifically been targeting, and then asked how they can hope to intercept illegal fishing boats when a massive tanker was missed for such a potentially long period of time.

It is located off Kingston Pike between the city's downtown area and West Knoxville. Initially developed in the 1920s, Sequoyah Hills was one of Knoxville's first suburbs, and today is home to some of the city's most affluent residents. The neighborhood contains numerous notable examples of mid-20th century residential architecture, with houses designed by architects such as Charles I. Barber, Benjamin McMurry, and Francis Keally. Sequoyah Hills is named for the Cherokee scholar Sequoyah (c. 1767-1843), inventor of the Cherokee alphabet.History of Kingston Pike/Sequoyah Hills. Retrieved: 20 December 2010. Originally an agrarian area known as Looney's Bend, the modern Sequoyah Hills neighborhood is largely rooted in the development efforts of 1920s-era visionary entrepreneurs E. V. Ferrell, who developed the Scenic Drive area, and Robert L. Foust, who established the \\"Talahi\\" subdivision in the vicinity of Cherokee Boulevard and Talahi Drive. Foust and Ferrell advertised their respective developments as utopian getaways where Knoxville's elite could escape from the ills of congested city life. While the Great Depression led to the financial collapse of the Talahi project and Foust's subsequent suicide, Sequoyah Hills nevertheless continued to develop over the years as Foust had envisioned. Cherokee Boulevard was home to Knoxville's first Dogwood Arts Trail, which was established in 1955.Dogwood Arts Trails - Sequoyah Hills . Retrieved: 20 December 2010. In 1979, the Talahi Improvements, which consist of several early landscape elements from Foust's Talahi development, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Location Sequoyah Hills is located on a peninsula created by a bend of the Tennessee River known as Looney's Bend. The neighborhood is bounded by the river on the east, south, and west, and by Kingston Pike (US-70/US-11) on the north, though the Kingston Pike/Sequoyah Hills Neighborhood Association includes several streets just north of Kingston Pike. The area is generally hilly, with a 10 to 15-foot bluff rising above the rivershore along most of the neighborhood's southern edge. From the edge of the bluff, the land gradually slopes upward, reaching approximately above the river, affording houses along the upper slopes sweeping views of the river and Knoxville in the distance. Sequoyah Park, which occupies most of the south side of the neighborhood, lies in the floodplain between the rivershore and base of the bluff. Cherokee Boulevard, a true boulevard with a grassy median dividing the right and left lanes, runs in a U-shape around the edge of the peninsula. The other main road, Scenic Drive/Southgate Road, runs roughly north-to-south across the center of the peninsula. A small commercial center, known as Council Point, is concentrated around the intersection of Kenesaw and Keowee avenues. History Early history Late Woodland burial mound along Cherokee Boulevard What is now Sequoyah Hills was inhabited by Native Americans as early as the Late Woodland period (c. 500-1100 A.D.), as indicated by a 1,000-year-old Indian mound that rises in the median of Cherokee Boulevard.Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission, West Sector Plan - Historical Development and Historical Resources, 9 August 2007. Retrieved: 20 December 2010. By the 18th century, the area was under control of the Cherokee, whose Overhill towns lay along the Little Tennessee River to the southwest. The neighborhood's eponym, Sequoyah, was born in the Overhill town of Tuskegee around 1767.Gerald Schroedl, Overhill Cherokees. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 20 December 2010. In 1796, Moses Looney (1750-1817), who had served in various capacities with the failed State of Franklin during the 1780s,J.G.M. Ramsey, Annals of Tennessee (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1999), pp. 288, 292. acquired a tract of land in what is now Sequoyah Hills. He and his descendants would remain on this land for several decades, and the area became known as \\"Looney's Bend.\\" Other early landowners in the Sequoyah Hills area included future Knoxville mayor James Park, who purchased a tract in 1804, William Lyon, who built a house and mill near the modern intersection of Lyon's View Pike and Northshore Drive around 1810, and Drury Armstrong (builder of Crescent Bend), who acquired a large tract of land west of modern Scenic Drive in 1846. The oldest house in Sequoyah Hills, which currently stands at 715 Scenic Drive, was originally built in the 1850s as a tenant house on the farm of Allen Johnson (1808-1898). Around 1814, George White, a son-in-law of James Park and a grandson of Knoxville founder James White, built a house along what is now Woodhill Drive. While this house is no longer standing, the remnants of a barn that accompanied the house can be seen on along Scenic Drive. Early development The \\"old\\" Cherokee Country Club, circa 1910 In 1890, Francis Huger, superintendent of the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway, acquired over in Sequoyah Hills with the intent of moving a steel mill to the area. The Panic of 1893 doomed this venture, however, and the land was distributed to Huger's creditors in 1908. Knox County road commissioner Peter Blow (1854-1945) built a house on the south bank of the river opposite Sequoyah Hills in 1910, where he operated a ferry. Blow's Ferry Road, which connected the ferry to Kingston Pike, is believed to have been built along a trail that once accessed a cemetery containing the graves of Civil War soldiers and slaves. In 1907, several Knoxville businessmen established the Cherokee Country Club on Lyon's View Pike, and erected a clubhouse on a hill with a commanding view of the river valley and the Great Smoky Mountains beyond. This original clubhouse was eventually demolished, and replaced with the current building, designed by the noted Knoxville architectural firm Baumann and Baumann, in 1928. In 1913, trolley tracks were extended along Kingston Pike to its Lyon's View Pike junction, aiding in the development of the area. What is now Sequoyah Hills was annexed by Knoxville in 1917.East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), p. 171. With the advent of the automobile, affluent Knoxvillians began fleeing the congested urban neighborhoods for more spacious areas on the city's periphery. By 1920, several elegant residences, such as the H.L. Dulin House (1915) on Kingston Pike and the C. Powell Smith (1913) and E.C. Mahan (1920) residences on Lyon's View Pike, had been built near Sequoyah Hills. In 1921, Regal Manufacturing president S. D. Coykendall commissioned noted Knoxville architectural firm Barber & McMurry to build a house on what is now Scenic Drive. Talahi and Sequoyah Hills In the mid-1920s, E. V. Ferrell began major residential development in Sequoyah Hills. To connect his holdings along the peninsula, he built Cherokee Boulevard (named for the Indian mound in the road's median), and improved Scenic Drive as far as its modern intersection with Bluff and Southgate (a gate at this point inspired the name of the latter). Ferrell chose the name \\"Sequoyah Hills\\" to match the name of Cherokee Boulevard. By 1924, houses had been built at 901, 919, 927 and 937 Scenic Drive, and fifty lots had been sold by the end of the decade. Prairie-style house along Scenic Drive, built in 1924 In 1926, Robert Foust, a partner in the real estate firm Alex McMillan Company, purchased a tract of land on the southeast section of Looney's Bend with plans to develop a premier subdivision for Knoxville. Foust envisioned a neighborhood for those \\"who insist upon and can afford the best,\\" and where \\"all the ugliness of city life has been shut out.\\" He named the new subdivision \\"Talahi,\\" Cherokee for \\"standing oak forest.\\" The new neighborhood, Foust believed, would bring together \\"an Indian past, a technical future, and a natural forest setting.\\" Foust recruited landscape engineer Earle S. Draper to oversee Talahi's complex landscape designs. The plans called for curvilinear streets, preservation of mature trees wherever possible, and underground utilities. Lot sizes were to be no less than 5,000 square feet, and were restricted to single-family homes. Foust's restrictions called for all houses to be built in English Cottage or American Colonial Revival styles (this restriction was abandoned by subsequent developers). A country club was to be built along the river bank. Between 1927 and 1929, Foust constructed several landscape features, including entrance pylons, fountains, and a park (Papoose Park). Talahi was opened to sales in the Spring of 1929. Unfortunately, only one lot-- 940 Cherokee Boulevard-- was sold before the stock market crashed later that year. In the early 1930s, lots in Talahi, originally marketed in the $4,000 to $10,000 range, were selling for just $600. His finances in ruins, Foust committed suicide in September 1933. Notable buildings and structures Talahi Improvements Gatepost along Cherokee Boulevard Before the stock market crash ruined his development efforts in 1929, Foust managed to complete several landscape improvements in the proposed Talahi subdivision. These include gateposts at either end of the subdivision along Cherokee Boulevard, two fountains, a park, streetlight standards, and stone benches. The roads were originally paved in concrete, which has been preserved along parts of Talahi Drive, Iskagna Drive, and Taliluna Avenue. The Talahi Improvements are concentrated primarily between the intersections of Talahi Drive and Cherokee Boulevard and Talahi Drive and Taliluna Avenue, with islands in both intersections containing the two fountains, called \\"Sunhouse Fountain\\" and \\"Panther Fountain,\\" respectively. Papoose Park, which is surrounded by an iron fence, is situated in the median along Talahi Drive between the two intersections. Stone walls with inset benches form a broken circle around the Cherokee Boulevard/Talahi Drive intersection, with the north walls opening toward Papoose Park, and the south walls opening toward the lake, where the proposed country club was to have been built. Sunhouse Fountain is a circular stone fountain with twelve small posts, each decorated with a sunburst motif, and each originally surmounted by a bronze frog (the frogs have since been removed). Panther Fountain is a circular fountain with a central obelisk resting atop a base of varying geometric shapes. Water was discharged through panther heads on each of the four sides of the base. Cherokee motifs decorate the gateposts, pylons, and fountains, suggesting inspiration from both Cherokee folklore and the Art Deco movement's emphasis on abstract figures.

He is the cofounder of Quicken Loans and founder of Rock Ventures. He is the owner of the National Basketball Association's Cleveland Cavaliers. Gilbert owns several sports franchises, including the American Hockey League's Cleveland Monsters, and the NBA G League's Canton Charge. He operates the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, Ohio, home to the Cavaliers and Monsters. Gilbert is the chairman of JACK Entertainment (formerly Rock Gaming), which opened its first Horseshoe Casino (now JACK Cleveland Casino) in downtown Cleveland in May 2012. With a net worth of $59.7 billion, he is the 19th richest person in the world. Early life and education Gilbert was born to a Jewish family in Detroit, Michigan. He grew up in Southfield, Michigan, where he attended Southfield-Lathrup High School. He earned his bachelor's degree from Michigan State University and a Juris Doctor from Wayne State University Law School, and is a member of the State Bar of Michigan. While in college he earned a real estate agent's license and while in law school, he worked part-time at his parents' Century 21 Real Estate agency. Business career Quicken Loans Gilbert, recognizing that the real potential was in originating mortgages and not in selling homes, founded Rock Financial in 1985 with his younger brother Gary Gilbert. The company grew into one of the largest independent mortgage lenders in the United States and in the late 1990s, launched its internet strategy and quickly positioned itself as the fastest-growing direct mortgage lender online. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company became the largest retail mortgage lender by volume in the United States. In 2000, software maker Intuit Inc. purchased Rock Financial. It renamed the national web operation Quicken Loans and grew substantially as the leading provider of direct-to-consumer home loans on the internet, offering mortgages in all 50 states. Gilbert remained at the company as CEO. In 2002, he led a small group of private investors that purchased Quicken Loans and its affiliated national title company, Title Source, Inc., from Intuit and continues to serve as the chairman of Quicken Loans, Inc. In 2010, Quicken Loans moved its headquarters and 1,700 of its employees to downtown Detroit. After moving all 3,600 Michigan-based team members into Detroit's urban core by the end of 2010, the company now has approximately 17,000 staff in downtown Detroit and a total of 24,000 nationwide, making the company one of Detroit's largest employers, minority employers, and taxpayers. Sports franchise ownership * Gilbert became majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers in March 2005 and undertook a complete overhaul of the front office, coaching staff, player personnel and game presentation. During Gilbert's tenure, the Cavs won six Central Division championships (2009, 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018), five Eastern Conference championships (2007, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018), and one NBA championship (2016) which ended the 52-year Cleveland sports curse. Also in 2016, Gilbert's Lake Erie Monsters won the AHL's top prize – the Calder Cup – giving Gilbert two championships within eight days. * In 2007, Gilbert bought the dormant Utah Grizzlies American Hockey League franchise, moved it to Cleveland and renamed it the Lake Erie Monsters (now Cleveland Monsters). * In 2011, Gilbert purchased the New Mexico Thunderbirds from what was then the NBA Developmental League (now called the G League), and moved them to Canton, Ohio (about an hour drive south of Cleveland) renaming them the Canton Charge, and making them the Cavaliers' affiliate. * In early 2012, Gilbert became the new owner of the Arena Football League's Cleveland Gladiators.  \\"The Letter\\"  Gilbert received national attention July 8, 2010, when NBA basketball superstar and northeast Ohio native LeBron James announced that he was leaving the Cavaliers for the Miami Heat on a highly criticized ESPN television special dubbed The Decision. Following the special, Gilbert published an open letter in Comic Sans font (dubbed nationally as \\"The Letter\\" as a counterpoint to The Decision) to Cleveland Cavaliers fans in which he strongly criticized how James made his announcement. On July 12, 2010, NBA Commissioner David Stern fined Gilbert $100,000 for his remarks in the letter. Gilbert has since regretted the open letter, which he wrote in 45 minutes when emotions were running high, and it was taken down from the team website after a few weeks but remained widely available on the Internet. Though some members of the media criticized Gilbert for this letter, many Cleveland Cavaliers fans embraced him for it and even offered to pay the fine. Gilbert instead insisted on donating the money to charity. Four years later when James opted out of his contract with Miami, Gilbert and James met privately. Gilbert apologized to LeBron for the open letter, stating \\"LeBron, we had five good years together and one bad night; like a marriage that's good and then one bad thing happens and you never talk to each other again.\\" James also expressed his regret to Gilbert about The Decision. The two embraced, and James subsequently returned to Cleveland in free agency days later. James explained his homecoming to Cleveland in his Sports Illustrated announcement writing \\"I've met with Dan, face-to-face, man-to-man. We've talked it out. Everybody makes mistakes. I've made mistakes as well. Who am I to hold a grudge?\\" Later, in 2017 James revisited the letter, commenting in GQ magazine he felt the letter had racial overtones. And in an interview with Uninterrupted, James described the letter as disrespectful.

This included the construction of an airstrip and 45 permanent buildings along with roads, railway spurs and several bridges. The area was used by Canadian Army units as early as 1928 when it was organized as Dundurn Military Camp (also Camp Dundurn). During World War II the Royal Canadian Air Force constructed a bombing range on the base and the Canadian Women's Army Corps established one of its first units at Camp Dundurn. The A27 Canadian Armoured Corps Training Centre (A27 CACTC) moved to Camp Dundurn from Camp Borden on January 28, 1942. A27 CACTC was later renamed A27 Canadian Reconnaissance Training Centre (A27 CRTC) and it remained on the base until March 1945. During World War II over 50,000 soldiers trained at Camp Dundurn before being assigned to duty overseas.The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan Following the war, Camp Dundurn remained open as a military facility and it was used as a transit hub and holding area for troops returning from the war. In 1947, the No. 6 Ordnance Ammunition Depot opened and permanent married quarters (PMQs) were constructed for personnel and their families. Military consolidation during the 1960s in the lead-up to unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968 saw Camp Dundurn made a detachment of CFB Moose Jaw in 1966 for administrative purposes. In 1988, administrative control of CFD Dundurn was reallocated to CFB Winnipeg's 17 Wing. Canadian Forces Ammunition Depot - Dundurn In 1947, No. 6 Ordnance Ammunition Depot an ammunition storage facility was established at Camp Dundurn. Following unification of the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Canadian Air Force and Canadian Army in 1968, No. 6 Ordnance Ammunition Depot was renamed Canadian Forces Ammunition Depot Dundurn (also CFAD Dundurn). CFAD Dundurn is classified as a lodger unit at CFD Dundurn. Today, CFAD Dundurn continues to function as an ammunition depot. CFAD Dundurn is the largest ammunition storage facility in the Canadian Forces, acting as the distribution centre for both domestic and overseas deployments.

Menaggio (Comasco: ) is a town and comune in the province of Como, Lombardy, northern Italy, located on the western shore of Lake Como at the mouth of the river Senagra. Menaggio has three frazioni (parishes): Croce, Loveno and Nobiallo. History The area of current Menaggio was conquered by the Romans in 196 BC. The Roman conquest culminated with the construction of a road called the Via Regina. Menaggio was a walled city. Remnants of the wall are evident today. Construction of big hotels in this cool summer area made it a summer resort area. Between 1873 and 1939, Menaggio was linked to Porlezza, on Lake Lugano, by the Menaggio–Porlezza railway, a steam hauled narrow gauge line built as part of a multi-modal transport link between Menaggio and Luino, on Lake Maggiore.  Tourism  The area of Menaggio is a favorite recreational resort in the summer. Lake Como's only youth hostel is in Menaggio. Menaggio is known for its Menaggio and Cadenabbia Golf Club, founded in 1907 by an English gentleman, one of many who was spending his holidays on Lake Como during the late 19th century.  Geology  The craggy and often fog hidden mountains are from the Cretaceous period, composed of limestone sediment weathered by millennia. Events Among many events which occur in the town every summer, the Menaggio Guitar Festival is relevant on an international scale. Guitarists who have played there since its first edition on 2005 include Pete Huttlinger, Martin Taylor, Franco Cerri, Roman Bunka, Solorazaf and Ferenc Snetberger.

The Nine Network commissioned five episodes, four of which were aired prior to the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Format The series was a sketch comedy and clip show featuring popular Szubanski characters from Fast Forward, Big Girl's Blouse and Kath & Kim. * Mary McGregor hosted the show and told stories about her love life and family. The character is a Scottish alcoholic, who sought a scotch company as a sponsor. * Chanelle from Chanelle's Institute de Beauty and House of Hair Removal. Chanelle first appeared in Fast Forward advertising outlandish hair and beauty products. In this series she advertised faulty products which were more threat than help. As with the Fast Forward sketches, the format was an advertorial segment on a fictional television show Mornings with Janelle. Janelle, the host, was played by Marg Downey. * Lynne hosted an Australia's Funniest Home Videos in competition with the real life host Toni Pearen. Lynne showed funny videos in her sketches but also made fun of both Pearen and then Nine Network CEO Eddie McGuire. * Sharon Strzelecki hosted Sharon's Wider World Of Sports, a spoof of Nine's Wide World of Sport. Strzelecki showed clips of sporting disasters in her sketches and, as in Kath & Kim, had a new sporting injury in each episode. Reception Despite Szubanski being one of Australia's most popular actors and comedians, critical and public reception of the series was poor. The West Australian described the series as \\"a classic example of safe but uninspired programming\\". The Herald Sun described it as one of the \\"least accurately titled shows to appear on Australian TV\\". The Australian and the Daily Telegraph labelled it as one of the biggest flops of 2006. The Courier Mail was even more scathing, saying \\"It is truly an embarrassment. Kerry Packer would be turning in his grave.\\" TV writer Andrew Mercado blamed the network, saying \\"What an abysmal thing to do to her. She's putting all those great comic characters into the worst possible scenario.\\" The series also performed poorly in the ratings, receiving only a quarter of the viewing audience of Dancing with the Stars.

Wapama Falls is fed by Lake Vernon, a few miles to the north, and is below Hetch Hetchy Dome. Wapama Falls descends just under 1,100 feet. Like Yosemite Falls, it has three distinct parts.

These cascades cannot be seen in their entirety from the trail: such a view is seen from across the Valley high on Kolana Rock. Finally, the bottom drop, seen from the dam and intimately from the trail, is one of about 200 feet down an escarpment that is not vertical, but in high water the water shoots outward to clear this descent.

History The War of 1812 had revealed many weaknesses in American muskets. The Model 1812 Musket was created in an attempt to improve both the design and manufacture of the musket. The Model 1816 made further improvements, and replaced the Model 1812. The Model 1812 had borrowed heavily from the design of the French Charleville model 1777 musket, and this design was retained for the Model 1816. The Model 1816 had a 42-inch (107 cm) long .69 caliber smoothbore barrel, similar to the Model 1812, but had a longer lock plate, a shorter trigger guard, and a longer bayonet than the Model 1812. The Model 1816 also had a more straight lined stock. The overall length of the weapon was 58 inches (147 cm).\\"Guns on the Early Frontiers\\" by Carl P. Russell, Published by U of Nebraska Press, 1980 A Model 1816 Musket Exploded View Diagram The Model 1816 musket was originally manufactured at the Harpers Ferry and Springfield Arsenals between 1816 and 1844. Around 675,000 were made, more than any other flintlock in U.S. history.http://www.nps.gov/spar/historyculture/sa-firearms-questions.htm Springfield Armory Weapons Research The Model 1816 was originally manufactured as a flintlock musket. Like many flintlock muskets, many of these were later converted to percussion cap, as the percussion cap system was much more reliable and weather resistant. This model of Springfield musket was used by Texans during the Texas Revolution and by the U.S. Army and militia during the Mexican–American War. During this conflict, the flintlock version of the Model 1816 was preferred by U.S. regular forces, due to percussion cap supply concerns.A Brief History of the 1816 Springfield Musket It was also used during the early years of the American Civil War until around 1862. The large majority of Model 1816 muskets had been converted to percussion firing by 1860. Muskets made prior to 1821 were considered too outdated to be serviceable weapons and were not converted. Most of them were in Southern arsenals and a large number of Confederate soldiers for the first year of the Civil War had the misfortune of carrying flintlock muskets, some of which dated back to the War of 1812. Many improvements to the Model 1816 were made, producing the Model 1822 Musket, Model 1835, Model 1840, and Model 1842. U.S. Ordnance Department referred to these as different models, but in other U.S. government documents they are referred to as a continuation of the Model 1816.Guns on the Early Frontiers by Carl P.

It is located at 909 Noyes Street (directional coordinates 2225 north, 900 west), just a few blocks west of the north end of Northwestern University's Evanston campus. The Noyes Cultural Center is also nearby. This area of Evanston is a mix of residential and light commercial properties. The automated voice for the station was used in the song \\"Chamber the Cartridge\\" by the melodic hardcore band, Rise Against. History Structure The current station was constructed in the early 1930s and is at least the second station on the site; the first was built at grade level and was demolished when the line north of University Place was elevated. Like the rest of the 'L' north of Wilson, Noyes is elevated on a solid fill embankment, unlike the steel structure commonly associated with the 'L'. The station lacks a formal station house; two staircases on the north side of Noyes Street lead up to a small area containing a customer assistant's booth, a farecard vending machine, and two turnstiles. The island platform is composed of concrete and stretches south from the station entrance, covered by a canopy its entire length. Southbound trains stop on the west side of the platform, while northbound trains stop at the east part. After the station was elevated, Noyes was capable of berthing eight-car trains. Currently the platform can only accommodate six-car trains because the concrete on the northern end of the platform has been removed, although its framing and canopy are still in place. Former service Noyes was served by trains of the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad on the Shore Line Route. Like Foster and Central, Noyes had an additional side platform to the west of the southbound track for exclusive use of the North Shore Line, to prevent disembarking customers from transferring to 'L' trains for free. The platform was removed sometime after the North Shore Line ceased operations over this section of the rapid transit system in 1955, but its concrete footings can still be seen opposite the current platform south of Noyes Street.

It was later known as the Thrane movement (Thranebevegelsen).Norwegian Emigrants with University Training 1830-1880 (by Oystein Ore Norwegian American Historic Association. (Volume 19: Page 160) Early life Thrane was born in Christiania, now Oslo, in 1817. Shortly after his birth, his father, a merchant and managing director in Norges Rigsbank, was arrested for involvement in corruption, which devastated the family's reputation. At only 15, Thrane was orphaned and had to move in with friends of the family. In 1837, Thrane left Norway and traveled to France through Germany and Switzerland. Thrane stayed in Paris for several months before returning to Norway in December 1837. After finishing examen artium (university admission exam) in 1840 and a brief period as a student of theology, Thrane and his new wife, Maria Josephine Buch, moved to Lillehammer in 1841, where they ran a private school. In 1846, Thrane moved his teaching to Åsgårdstrand. In March 1847, Thrane came to Åmot in Modum, where he began work as a teacher for the workers' children at the large industrial company, Blaafarveværket. It was there that he experienced his first political awakening. In April, the year after the company was experiencing difficulties, Thrane, together with 250 workers, were sacked. The family then moved to Drammen, the hometown of his wife, where Thrane became the editor of the local newspaper Drammens Adresse, but because of his radical opinions, he was fired after only five months. He had already begun his political activities.Marcus Thrane In Christiania: Unpublished Letter from 1850-1851 (Translated and edited by Waldemar Westergaard. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 20: Page 143)m Labour movement On December 27, 1848, Thrane founded Drammens arbeiderforening (Drammen Labour Union) with 160 members. The following year, several other local unions joined a national organization, and Thrane printed the first edition of the union's paper, Arbeiderforeningernes Blad. In May 1850, the union delivered a petition to King King Oscar II of Sweden and the Norwegian Storting (parliament), which was signed by 13,000 members. The union asked for universal voting, the extension of mandatory military service to those with property, equality before the law, better schools, low or no border taxes on necessary goods, such as grains, and special support for poor farmers in the form of arable land on reasonable terms. The union was primarily a union for agricultural workers and crofters and so it cannot be seen as a direct precedent for Norway's later labour movements. In November, the government dismissed the petition. The union's national conference, in February 1851, sought a revolution. Although Thrane managed to stop it, the authorities seized the opportunity to have him arrested. Thrane and 132 other members were sentenced on June 25, 1855. Thrane was sentenced to four years in prison, in addition to the four years that had already passed. The imprisonments and internal tension resulted in the end of the movement, and Thrane's attempts of revitalizing it after his release from prison were unsuccessful.\\"Marcus Møller Thrane ( Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 2009) Later life After the collapse of the movement, Thrane became a photographer and when his wife died in 1862, he emigrated to the United States. He restarted his political activities among Scandinavian immigrants and continued his career as a journalist. In 1865, Thrane started the Chicago- based newspaper Norske-Amerikanerne . On May 2, 1866, John Anderson purchased the subscription lists of the foundering Norske-Amerikanerne to start the Norwegian language newspaper Skandinaven. In 1866, Thrane started a second Chicago newspaper, Dagslyset which he published until 1878.Skandinaven and the John Anderson Publishing Company(by Jean Skogerboe Hansen. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 28: Page 35) In 1866, the Norwegian Synod had felt sufficiently threatened to issue \\"A Warning to all Christians,\\" which condemned his socialistic ideas, but the writings that he had put out in Chicago actually reached only a small number of fellow socialists. He published a satirical depiction of the visit of the Norwegian author Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, which he called \\"The Old Wisconsin Bible\\" (Den gamle Wisconsin-bibelen). It was mainly directed against the church leaders in the Synod.Marcus Thrane (The Promise of America) Among a number of more-or-less successful ventures in the United States, Thrane wrote and produced a number of plays for Norwegian-speaking audiences. The Norwegian Theater (Norske Teater) was established by Thrane in Chicago in September 1866. Many of its plays were written by Thrane.Selected Plays of Marcus Thrane ( University of Washington Press. 2008) In 1883, he returned to Norway for a brief visit and held a number of lectures but, disappointed by the moderate interest, he returned to the United States, where he died in 1890, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.Marcus Thrane in America. Some Unpublished Letters from 1880-1884 (Translated and Edited By Waldemar Westergaard. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume IX: Page 67) Years later in 1949, Thrane's coffin was sent to Norway, where he was buried and remains today in Vår Frelsers Gravlund in Oslo. Legacy Although his movement existed for only a few years, Thrane's work was an important contribution in the politicisation of the Norwegian worker. The Norwegian Labour Party (founded in 1887) refers to him as one of its founding fathers. Indeed, the Thrane movement brought the rural and the urban lower classes in common cause for the first time in Norway. Today, Thrane is remembered in Drammen, the city where he started Norway's first labour union, Drammen Arbeiderforening. On October 14, 2017, the city held a 200-year celebration for Thrane’s birthday. He is still recognized for his efforts and labor activisim. A monument of him stands in his honor in Strømsø square.

The Smooth Rock Falls economy was dominated by the Tembec Malette pulp mill, which was closed on December 5, 2006. Prior to that, the mill had been in a state of indefinite shutdown since July 31, 2006. The closure of the mill meant the loss of about 210 jobs. The town of Smooth Rock Falls made a series of announcements regarding community investments since Tembec's departure and the closure of the pulp mill. On July 13, 2007 a joint news conference between the town and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources revealed the former Tembec pulp mill would be converted into a value-added cedar plant. Quebec-based Hardy Cedar Lumber took control of the mill and was provided with 50,000 cubic metres of cedar from the province. The cedar project would provide the community with as many as 44 full-time jobs. One month prior to the cedar announcement, the town made public an investor's plan to build a new seniors retirement home, 80-100 room hotel and establish a new Indian restaurant.

Located along the southern Adriatic, the area was part of Magna Grecia and certainly one of the centers of Ancient Greek music. And 1,000 years ago, Bari, on the coast, was a privileged sanctuary for pilgrims and Crusaders on their way to the Holy Land. Yet, the only musical relic that remains from the period is the Excultet, a representation from the 11th century of two angels playing trumpets that is preserved in the Basilica of San Nicola in Bari. Later, as part of the Kingdom of Naples, Apulia produced many memorable names in music, but like elsewhere in the south, many of them gravitated to Naples, the capital of the kingdom. Further, economic hardships in the south following the unification of Italy through much of the 20th century resulted in massive emigration, a phenomenon hardly conducive to emphasis on music and the arts. Yet, modern Apulia has shown itself to be remarkably resilient and has an active, if still struggling, musical life.  Folk music  Apulia was home to the well-known folk song revivalist Matteo Salvatore. The healing tarantolati ritual is an important part of Apulian folk culture. The ritual is centered on Saint Paul and women (tarantolati) who are said to have been bitten by a tarantula. The poison from the bite is said to be healed by dancing, sometimes for hours or even days. The dances include the tarantella and tarantata, and is accompanied by tamburelli and either violin, organetto or guitar.  Brass bands  Apulia is known for its brass band tradition, which includes the Bando Ruvo di Puglia, led by Pino Minafra. In recent music, this brass band tradition has involved many of the region's jazz performers.  Music venues  Paisiello at the clavichord, by Marie Louise Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, 1791. Paisiello was a native of Apulia The Petruzzelli Operatic and Symphonic Foundation of Bari is the organization around which much of the cultural life of the city revolves. It is named for the famous Teatro Petruzzelli, the center of music life in the city and province, but which fell victim to a disastrous fire in 1991 and reopened just in 2009. Taking up that slack, however, are other venues: the Basilica of San Nicola, the premises of the Piccinni Conservatory, and the Teatro Piccinni (now closed). The city of Bari also hosts the interesting Kismet Theater, a permanent theatrical and musical workshop, open to the public 6 days a week, the aim of which is to encourage those activities among the youth. Brindisi's new Verdi Theater had its first concert in 2002. The theater is an impressive hyper modern structure that seats 1200 and was built near the presumed place where the poet Virgil is said to have died. The area contains significant Roman archaeology, which caused delays in the completion of the new concert hall. The city and province of Foggia are noted as the birthplace of composer Umberto Giordano and much musical activity recalls that fact. The main venue for opera was built in 1828 and was renamed the Giordano Theater in 1928. The city has a secondary theater, named for Giuseppe Verdi. Lecce was the birthplace of the great tenor, Tito Schipa. It also hosts a music conservatory and is the home of the Salento Chamber ensemble. The Teatro Comunale is named for Giovanni Paisiello, one of the great names in 18th century Neapolitan comic opera. The \\"city on two seas\\", Taranto, recalls its connection to ancient Greece in the names of musical organizations such as the Magna Grecia Orchestra, the Ionian Art Orchestra and the Magna Grecia Choir. The area hosts the Association for the Music of Paisiello (born here), sponsors the annual Nicolosi Song Competition, and is the site of the internationally known Valle d'Itria Festival. It takes place in July and August, during which time the entire city of Taranto becomes a collection of venues for music of various sorts. It is considered one of the most important cultural manifestations in southern Italy.  References  *Guide Cultura, i luoghi della music (2003) ed.

He is introduced in the manga xxxHolic as a high school student plagued by his ability to see spirits. In order to lose such powers, Watanuki starts working for the witch Yūko Ichihara who will grant his wish once he pays the price for her services. Besides appearing as the main character in xxxHolic, Watanuki is also featured in the crossover manga Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle which explores his connection with a teenager named Syaoran as well as his origins. Outside the two manga, Watanuki has been featured in their animated adaptations, spin-offs as well as other works by Clamp. Watanuki was created by Clamp following their need to have a main character who would observe Yūko's work and learn from her supernatural activities. His character has been well received by publications for manga and anime due to his role in the series and character development. Several positive comments also focused on his role in the series' last arc where he succeeds Yūko as the person who grants people's wishes. Creation and design Jun Fukuyama voices Watanuki in Japanese After creating Yūko, Clamp believed her character was so interesting she could be the only main character in the series. However, they then wondered it would more interesting if they created another character who, like Yūko, would also be connected with the spirits and across the story would see Yūko's life and often ask her about the supernatural events. They compared Yūko and Watanuki with Doraemon and Nobita Nobi, respectively, from the manga series Doraemon. Unlike Yūko, Watanuki's personality and design were not difficult to write and illustrate. He was based on a real beautician who has not been identified by the authors. Although the authors noted that Domeki and Yuko were the series' most popular characters, Clamp illustrator Tsubaki Nekoi found that Watanuki was very popular with female readers. Nekoi believed this was due to his kindhearted personality rather than his appearance while head writer Nanase Ohkawa believed it was due to his multiple skills. When reaching the series' conclusion, Clamp received many letters from fans who were saddened with Watanuki's decision to stay inside the shop even after one hundred years. The authors were pleased with the readers' comments and clarified that for Watanuki staying in the shop made him. In Japanese Watanuki is voiced by Jun Fukuyama. He was first cast for Bee Train's adaptation of Tsubasa but had no problem in contrast to Yuko's actress. Fukuyama was attracted by how his character was often part of comedy-like Tsukkomi situations. He was also attracted to the main cast so he was overjoyed when recording xxxHolic Kei. In casting Fukuyama, they made him try a more innocent tone in contrast to other roles he played. For the character's role in Blood-C: The Last Dark, Fukuyama needed to portray Watanuki as a mature character despite not aging from his appearance in xxxHolic. In the English dub of the anime series, Todd Haberkorn voices him. Appearances In xxxHolic and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle Watanuki is a high school student who has the ability of seeing spirits and is disturbed as a result. One day he stumbles, seemingly by chance, upon the wish-granting shop of Yūko Ichihara. She promises to remove his ability to see spirits if he works part-time in her shop until his work equals the worth of his wish. Since he lives by himself, he is experienced in cooking and cleaning, much to Yūko's pleasure. Besides doing domestic tasks for Yūko, Watanuki also often completes jobs of a spiritual or magical nature. He generally gets enraged at the often insane requests of Yūko, though he pays close attention whenever she is serious with him. Watanuki is known for being both volatile and caring. While around his crush, Himawari Kunogi, he is usually cheerful and excited, whereas around Shizuka Dōmeki he is much more irritable. During his work, Watanuki encounters spirits who take his right eye for the destruction of a web. He then starts sharing Dōmeki's eyesight which allows him to detect evil spirits. When nearly dying while falling from his school's second floor, Watanuki learns he is related to a teenager named Syaoran who paid Yūko for his health alongside Himawari and Dōmeki. Watanuki is unaware he was used to fill the gap left by Syaoran after he decided to turn back time and accept imprisonment by sorcerer Fei-Wang Reed as payment. Watanuki became the child of Syaoran's parents and filled all of the relationships Syaoran would have made. Before the series' start, Watanuki gave up the memories of his past as a price to find Fei-Wang and help Syaoran. As he then could not remember his parents, Watanuki developed a strong sense of guilt, thinking his parents died due to his fault, and this guilt led to his ability to attract spirits. Across the story, Watanuki manages to overcome his selfishness and becomes concerned about granting Yūko's wish. Watanuki's origins and interactions with Syaoran are also explored in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. When Yūko dies, Watanuki resolves to take care of the shop so he can wait for her return. During the climax of Tsubasa, Watanuki and Syaoran have to pay a price to survive Fei- Wang's dying curse with Watanuki's price being the \\"time in him\\", meaning he will never age. He then becomes the new master of the shop and takes up Yūko's job of granting wishes to the shop's customers during the last volume from xxxHolic subtitled xxxHolic Rō. He is also unable to leave the shop, due to his power. His personality changes as he adopts some of Yūko's quirks and habits. He works with help from Domeki who brings him materials from outside. Over the following years, Watanuki's powers become stronger since he retains his ability to see spirits. More than a hundred years after taking over the shop, Watanuki's powers grow strong enough to allow him to leave the shop, but he decides to remain there, waiting to see Yūko again. Other appearances Shota Sometani plays the character of Watanuki in the series' live-action. Outside the xxxHolic and Tsubasa manga, Watanuki has appeared in the film xxxHolic: A Midsummer Night's Dream where he visits a collector's mansion and he investigates the mystery behind multiple disappearances. In the original video animation (OVA) xxxHolic Rō, Watanuki, as the new shop's owner, receives a tape with Yūko's voice. In the second OVA, Watanuki is requested by the spirit of Dōmeki's grandfather, Haruka, to investigate his grandson's dreams. Watanuki appears as the protagonist of the manga xxxHolic Rei where he is featured as Yūko's assistant. While seeing several of Yūko's cases, Watanuki realizes that his boss is waiting for him to make an important decision. Eventually, he learns that he is living in an alternate dimension where Yuko is not dead. After saying goodbye to his boss, Watanuki returns to reality to give Syaoran a group of items. In Tsubasa World Chronicle he meets Syaoran and gives him the items. Shota Sometani plays Watanuki in the live action TV series. The video game xxxHolic ~Watanuki no Izayoi Sowa~ also features Watanuki. He is also a prominent character in the novelization Another Holic by Nisio Isin. He also appeared in other works related with Clamp including the seventeenth episode of the anime adaptation of Kobato where he receives a package from one of the series' characters. In the book Soel and Larg: The Adventures of Mokona Modoki he is seen awakening the two creatures known as Mokona Modoki with one of them staying in the shop and the other being used by protagonists from Tsubasa. Yūko tells Watanuki how she created the two Mokonas alongside a sorcerer named Clow Reed in the xxxHolic Kei CD drama. In the manga Drug and Drop he hires its two protagonists for a job involving the encounter of a supernatural being. In the Blood-C anime he appears as a dog contacting the protagonist Saya Kisaragi whom he meets in person in the feature film where he grants her wish of obtaining a new sword. In the Holitsuba CD drama series Watanuki appears as a high school student from the titular school. Reception In a xxxHolic poll, Watanuki was voted as the most popular character from the series. Director Tsutomu Mizushima referred to Watanuki as his favorite character from the series due to his personality and commented that he identifies with him. Critical reception to the character has been generally positive. Although Watanuki was initially seen as \\"a little bit weak to be the lead character\\" by Polley Dan from Manga Life, his interactions with other characters and his development across the series has been praised. Ed Sizemore from Comics Worth Reading that while Watanuki was introduced as a \\"selfish, self-centered, but not very self-aware\\" character due to his origins, his growth across the series has made him far more likable as the changes allowed him to \\"mature into adulthood.\\" While at this point Watanuki started undergoing existential vertigo, the way it was presented was well received by Sizemore. Matthew Alexander from Mania Entertainment liked the development of Watanuki's and Yuko's relationship as across the series Watanuki starts caring about his boss' true desire since he realizes how much she cares for him. Writers from Manga Bookshelf compared Watanuki with Tokyo Babylon main character Subaru Sumeragi based on how both deal with supernatural being and society but found that Watanuki acted more as a normal teenager than Subaru due to his habit of becoming irritated. Similar to Manga Bookshelf's writers, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network compared Watanuki's development in the series with Subaru's due to how both characters start behaving like close people to them. Matthew Alexander also compared Watanuki's new characterization with Yuko's as it shows him maturing by his no longer throwing angry tantrums and by his unwillingness to forget the witch. Carlo Santos praised Watanuki's role as the shop's new owner due to how he manages to replace Yuko by taking on some of her traits such a calmer demeanor as well as wearing multiple outfits. Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin liked Watanuki's calm demeanor when dealing with clients which helped to build an appealing atmosphere. Todd Haberkorn's work as Watanuki's English voice actor has been criticized by Santos for making the character sound annoying rather than funny.

Crawford was famous as an able administrator as well as for his allegedly, underhand financial dealings. Crawford acquired the Agri-Horticulture Society's gardens at Sewri in order to build the European cemetery in 1865. Crawford Market in South Mumbai was named after him. When he took over as Commissioner, water supply was scanty, garbage was piling up and the mortality rate was a high 40 per 1,000. Crawford cleaned the streets, fixed the drains and lowered the mortality rate by half from 35,000 to 18,000 over the next two years. However his plans greatly overshot the civic budget and he was accused of financial mismanagement after he refused to heed to warnings that the deficit was ever widening. While criticised by many, he was defended by lawyer Pherozeshah Mehta during the Municipal controversy circa 1870. Later in his career it was alleged that Crawford had accepted bribes from mamlatdars (executive heads of a taluka). This prompted a fierce public debate led by Lokmanya Tilak and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. The subsequent inquiry, chaired by Judge Arthur Wilson of the Calcutta High Court, found Crawford (then the Commissioner of Bombay Presidency's Central Division), not guilty of accepting bribes but only of borrowing money from official subordinates. Crawford was subsequently removed from the Civil Service List and asked to return to London. According to Govid Talwalkar's author of Gopal Krishna Gokhale: His Life and Times, a June 1890 Westminster Review article alleged that Crawford's illegal funds were transferred to Europe through a French bank. Then, as a decoy, he wrote two letters to his brother based in Bombay that he would commit suicide at Holkar Bridge in Poona (now Pune). Dressed as a tramp, he boarded the third-class compartment of a Bombay-bound train. While in a hotel near the docks, the police got wind of his presence and arrested him. Crawford had tried to buy a ticket to Colombo. Back in London, he penned his memoirs on his life in India, titled Our Troubles in Poona and the Deccan which was published in 1897. He described many communities in the Bombay region along with their sketches. He meted out special harsh criticism on Brahmins. His fluency in Marathi ironically however led contemporary writer N. C. Kelkar to comment that Crawford could have passed off as a Chitpawan Brahmin had he donned a dhoti. Other books published by Crawford include Reminiscence of an Indian Police Officer, The Unrest in India and Legends of Konkan.

Previously the parliamentary secretary assisting the Attorney-General, in 2010 Portolesi was appointed Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation, Multicultural Affairs, Youth and Volunteers. Portolesi was appointed Minister for Education and Child Development in 2011, a position she held until 2013. From 2013 to 2014 she was the Minister for Employment, Higher Education and Skills, Minister for Science and Information Economy, and a Member of the Executive Council.Grace Portolesi: SA Parliament She is aligned with Labor's left faction. Early life Portolesi was born in Adelaide to a migrant Italian family. She studied public policy and government at Flinders University where she became involved in student politics, serving as president of the Flinders University Student Association. She worked as an equal opportunities officer at the University of South Australia after graduating from university.Hartley, 2014 SA election: ABC Political career In the early 1990s, she moved to Queensland to take up a position as an advisor to then Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss. She returned to Adelaide some years later to work as a policy advisor to then Opposition Leader, Mike Rann. When Labor won government in 2002, she took up the position of chief of staff for the Minister for Families and Community Services, Jay Weatherill, a position she held until her election to parliament in 2006. 2006 election Portolesi decided to enter politics prior to the 2006 state election, and was nominated, unopposed, for preselection to the then highly marginal Liberal seat of Hartley. The traditionally Labor seat had been won by Joe Scalzi at the Liberal landslide of 1993, and as a popular local member, Scalzi went against the predictions to retain the seat in 1997 and 2002. Portolesi's status as an Italian-Australian broadened her support in the ethnically diverse community, and helped neutralise a factor that Scalzi had used to his advantage in the past.Labor 'flood' drowns Hartley MP: ABC 18 March 2006The 2006 South Australian Election - something old, something new, something borrowed and something (not) blue: University of Newcastle Although Labor was widely expected to win several seats at the election, Hartley was expected to be a particularly close race, due to Scalzi's incumbency, personal support, and record of bucking wider electoral trends. The campaign in the seat was heavily presidential, with Premier Mike Rann strongly supporting Portolesi and doorknocking homes for her several times. Some local issues were raised, however, mostly in the form of policing and the fate of Lochiel Park, which had been threatened with development. Early polls placed Scalzi as the favourite, but Portolesi slowly narrowed the gap, and was leading the polls by January 2006. She seemed to suffer a major setback when polls in the week before the election returned to predicting a win for Scalzi.Kerin heartened by marginal seat opinion polls: ABC 16 March 2006 However, Portolesi achieved a 5.9 percent two-party swing to finish with a 4.6 percent margin. The result was closer than in other similarly marginal seats, with Scalzi initially refusing to concede defeat, but the result had become clear by the end of the night, and he did so the following day. Three days later, it was announced that Portolesi would be appointed as a parliamentary secretary (assisting the Attorney-General) in the new government, the only one of the party's new recruits to gain such a position. 2010 election At the 2010 state election, Portolesi held Hartley with a margin of 2.3 percent. Portolesi was part of a successful campaign to reverse the closure of the Italian Consulate at Glynde which had been earmarked for closure by the Italian government. 2014 election At the 2014 election, Hartley had undergone a significant redistribution, with Portolesi's margin reduced to 0.1 percent. She lost the seat to Liberal candidate Vincent Tarzia from a 2.6 percent two-party swing. Political persuasion Portolesi has been a vocal supporter of paid maternity leave, and established a select committee on work/life balance in her first year as the Member for Hartley. She dedicated her election in 2006 to 'working mums', and spoke in her maiden speech of the 'struggle to juggle' – the work/life balance.Grace Portolesi maiden speech: SA Parliament In 2008 she introduced a private member's bill to protect patients' medical records after she was made aware that a landlord in her electorate was withholding 10,000 confidential records as part of a tenancy dispute. The legislation passed both Houses of the South Australian parliament. Portolesi is in the left-wing of the Labor Party. She has shown support for same-sex unions and is a member of the pro-choice organisation for Australian women parliamentarians, Emily's List. She is an opponent of the Family First Party, and expressed relief at the conclusion of the 2006 campaign that she had been able to win the seat without their preferences.Goers, Peter. \\"Amazing Grace: After all, she put up with a wretch like me.\\" Sunday Mail, 26 February 2006.Anderson, Laura. \\"Scalzi concedes defeat in Hartley.\\" The Advertiser, 20 March 2006.

(1756 – 20 June 1818) was a British physician and surgeon. Life He was born in 1756. His father was a practising apothecary in London, and a rigid dissenter who, because of his religious beliefs, would not allow his son to attend Oxford or Cambridge. He, however, received a good classical education and, having been apprenticed to his father, became a member of the Society of Apothecaries. He studied under Dr. Pitcairn and Mr. Pott at St Bartholomew’s, Dr. Saunders at Guy's, and Mr. John Hunter at St. George's hospitals. In 1790, he became a member of the Corporation of Surgeons, and in 1795 published a small volume on Morbid Poisons. On the basis of that work, the University of Aberdeen awarded him an M.D. The following year, he left London for Madeira, where he resided for eight years, practising medicine and conducting research. He visited the lazaretto near Funchal, and learned about leprosy, yaws, and other diseases. This work contributed to the second edition of his work on Morbid Poisons, which he is principally known for. He has the merit of having introduced the cowpox into Madeira. He returned to England in 1805, and was admitted as an extra-licentiate (without examination) to the London Royal College of Physicians. When Dr. Woodville died in 1806, he succeeded him as physician at the Smallpox Hospital. At this time, the practice of vaccination was slowly recovering from numerous unfounded attacks. A general report authored under Adams' inspection and circulated by the committee of the hospital, helped remove alarm and inspire confidence. This, with a second report, was communicated to the College of Physicians, printed and circulated, and passed through thirteen editions. The produce of the sale was given to the hospital, with a net balance of cash, amounting to 1517l. 16s. 8d., being invested. Dr. Adams believed (erroneously) that cowpox and smallpox were the same disease. This opinion was shared by Dr. Edward Jenner. Dr. Adams drew his arguments in favour of their identity from the near resemblance of the most favourable kinds of smallpox to the cowpox, and presumptive proofs deduced from the laws of other morbid poisons, that the variolous and vaccine is the same. He contended that the character of the disease might change depending on the pustule used as a vaccine source, and that inoculations from cases of what he called pearl smallpox caused mild affections difficult to distinguish from those cowpox. In 1804, Adams received an inheritance that allowed him to indulge his taste for study, and also philanthropy. His attachment to his profession was ardent. He delivered several lecture courses, and edited the London Medical and Physical Journal for many years. Death He died on 20 June 1818, at the age of 62, following a compound fracture of the leg. He is buried in Bunhill Fields, with the simple motto, \\"Vir Justus et bonus,\\" inscribed on his tomb.Emery, Alan E. H. (1989). Joseph Adams (1756-1818). Journal of Medical Genetics 26: 116–118. Legacy Adams has been described by science historians as a forgotten founder of medical genetics and the first clinical geneticist.Motulsky A. G. (1959). Joseph Adams (1756–1818): A Forgotten Founder of Medical Genetics. AMA Arch Int Med 104: 490–496. In 1814, he authored A Treatise on the Supposed Hereditary Properties of Diseases, based on years of clinical research. Adams was an early (albeit forgotten) anticipator of evolution. Anthropologist Kenneth M. Weiss has written: > Darwin and Wallace were, to the best of my knowledge, wholly unaware of > Adams, though in many ways he was ahead of them in time. He had a clearer > understanding of the nature of the hereditary mechanisms underpinning > evolution, even if, as a physician, he did not discuss the transmutation of > species.Weiss, Kenneth M. (2008). Joseph Adams in the Judgment of Paris. > Evolutionary Anthropology 17: 245–249. Works He published the following works: *Observations on Morbid Poisons, Phagedaena, and Cancer. Lond. 8vo. Second edit. 1807. 4to. The singular title of this work derives from Mr. Hunter's division of poisons into the natural and the diseased—those that belong to a healthy animal with no ill effect to that animal, and those that result from disease and can spread to other individuals. He treats, among other diseases of Leprosy, or the Elephantiasis of the ancients, the Elephantiasis of the moderns, or the Barbadoes Leg, and the Lepra Graecorum, &c.; He also gives an account of the Acarus Syro (Exulcerans of Linnaeus), called the Itch Insect by some (itch mite). During this research, he inoculated himself and family members with the insect to prove the itch and the disease from the Acarus were distinct from each other. To comprehend more precisely the nature of the Sibbens or Sivvens, he made a journey into Dumfries-shire and produced a good summary on the subject. *Observations on the Cancerous Breast. Lond. 1801. 8vo. Second edit. 1805. He regards the existence of cysts or hydatids, possessed of a life independent of the subject they grow in, as constituting the true essential character of the true carcinoma. Dr. Baron has since carried the matter farther, and affirms that all tumours take their origin from hydatids. *Guide to Madeira. Lond. 1801. 8vo. Second edit. 1808. *Answers to all the Objections hitherto made against Cow-pox. Lond. 1805. 8vo. *A popular View of Vaccine Inoculation. Lond. 1807. 12mo. *Reports of the Royal College of Physicians in London, Dublin, and Edinburgh, on Vaccination; with introductory Remarks, and other Papers. Lond. 1809. 8vo. These being addressed rather to the public than to the profession, are written in a popular style, and served in a measure to allay the anxiety naturally entertained on such an important subject. *An Inquiry into the Laws of Epidemics. Lond. 1809. 8vo. In this work, Dr. Adams assists in marking the distinction between contagious and infectious diseases. The first proposal for the establishment of savings banks appears in this volume, Appendix, No. 4. *A Republication of one of John Hunter's Treatises, with a Commentary, which possesses no particular claims to notice. *An Illustration of Mr. Hunter's Doctrine, particularly concerning the Life of the Blood. Lond. 1811. 8vo. His enthusiastic advocacy of the doctrines of John Hunter, led Dr. Adams to publish this reply to the observations in the Edinburgh Review on Mr. Abernethy's Physiological Lectures. *Syllabus of a Course of Lectures on the Institutes and Practice of Medicine. Lond. 1811. 12mo. *A Treatise on the Supposed Hereditary Properties of Diseases.

The game has a post-apocalyptic and retro-futuristic setting, taking place in the mid-22nd century decades after a global nuclear war in an alternate history timeline. The protagonist of Fallout is an unnamed inhabitant of a Vault, part of a network of long-term nuclear shelters, who is forced to venture out into the wastes to find a replacement Water Chip and save their fellow Vault inhabitants. Fallout is considered to be the spiritual successor to the 1988 role-playing video game Wasteland. It was initially intended to use Steve Jackson Games' system GURPS, but Interplay eventually used their own internally developed system, SPECIAL. The game was critically acclaimed and a financial success. It was followed by a number of sequels and spin-off games, collectively known as the Fallout series. Gameplay Gameplay in Fallout centers around the game world, visiting locations and interacting with the local inhabitants. Occasionally, inhabitants will be immersed in dilemmas, which the player may choose to solve in order to acquire karma and experience points. Fallout deviates from most role-playing video games in that it often allows the player to complete tasks in multiple ways, allowing solutions that are unconventional or contrary to the original task, in which case the player may still be rewarded, or earn an unconventional reward. The player's actions and/or inaction dictates what future story or gameplay opportunities are available, and ultimately dictates the ending of the game. Players will encounter hostile opponents and – if such encounters are not avoided using stealth or persuasion – they and the player will engage in turn-based combat. Excepting conversations with non-player characters, non-combat portions of the game are played in real time. Combat in Fallout is turn-based. The game uses an action-point system, wherein each turn, multiple actions may be performed by each character until all points in their pool have been expended. Different actions consume different numbers of points, and the maximal number of points that can be spent is determined by a character's total agility statistic and modifying elements such as chems (which are temporary) and perks (which are permanent). \\"Melee\\" (hand-to-hand) weapons typically offer multiple attack types, such as \\"swing\\" and \\"thrust\\" for knives. Unarmed attacks offer many attack types, including \\"punch\\" and \\"kick\\". Players may equip at most two weapons, and the player can switch between them at the click of a button. The \\"perception\\" attribute determines characters' \\"sequence\\" number, which then determines the order of turns in combat; characters with a higher statistic in this attribute are placed at an earlier position in the sequence of turns, and subsequently get new turns earlier. Perception also determines the maximal range of ranged weapons and the chance to hit with them. A diverse selection of recruitable non-player characters (NPCs) can be found to aid the player character in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Examples include Ian, an experienced traveler and gunman who can use pistols and submachine guns, and Dogmeat, a dog the player may recruit in Junktown by either wearing a leather jacket or feeding the dog an iguana-on-a-stick. Unlike Fallout 2, there is no limit to the number of NPCs that the player may recruit, and NPCs' statistics and armor in Fallout remain unchanged through the entire game; only their weapons may be upgraded. An example of dialogue between characters in Fallout SPECIAL system The protagonist is governed by the system called S.P.E.C.I.A.L (an acronym for \\"Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck\\"), designed specifically for Fallout and used in the other games in the series. The player begins Fallout by selecting one of three characters to play as the protagonist, or alternatively, they can create one with custom attributes using the system. Character development is divided into four categories: attributes, skills, traits, and perks. These have been copied or otherwise adapted in some form or another through the ensuing iterations of the series. Strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck are the seven basic attributes of every character in the game. The SPECIAL stats continually add bonuses to skills. This is done automatically, i.e. if the SPECIAL stats change, the bonuses are instantly adjusted. Some \\"perks\\" and coded events within the game require that the player has a certain level of particular SPECIAL stat before accessing it. There are 18 different skills in the game, ranging in value from 0 to 200%. The starting values for Level 1 skills are determined by the player's seven basic attributes, and most initially fall within the range of 0 to 50%. Every time the player gains a level, skill points are awarded, which can be used to improve the character's skills. The player may choose to tag three skills that will improve at twice the normal rate and receive a bonus at the start. Skills are divided into three categories: combat, active and passive. Books, although scarce in the early game, can be found throughout the game world and permanently improve a specific skill when read. However, after a skill reaches a certain level, books no longer have an impact. Some NPCs can also improve skills by training. Some skills are also improved by having certain items equipped. For instance, a lockpick improves lock-picking skills. Stimulants can also temporarily boost a player's skills, however, they often have adverse effects such as addiction and withdrawal. Traits are special character qualities that can have significant effects on gameplay. At character creation, the player may choose up to two traits. Traits typically carry benefits coupled with detrimental effects. For example, the trait \\"small frame\\" improves agility by one point, but negatively affects maximal carrying capacity. Once a trait is chosen, it is impossible to change, except by using the \\"mutate\\" perk, which allows a player to change one trait, one time. Perks are a special element of the level-up system. Every three levels (or every four if the player chooses the \\"skilled\\" trait), the player is presented with a list of perks and can choose one to improve their character. Perks grant special effects, most of which are not obtainable through the normal level-up system. These include letting the player perform more actions per round or being able to heal wounds faster. Unlike traits, perks are purely beneficial; they are offset only by the infrequency with which they are acquired. The game also tracks the moral quality of the player character's actions using a statistic called \\"karma\\", as well as a series of reputations. Karma points are awarded for doing good deeds and are subtracted for doing evil deeds. The player character may receive one of a number of \\"reputations\\", which act like perks, for meeting a certain threshold of such actions or for engaging in an action that is seen as singularly and morally reprehensible. The effect of both karma and reputations is subtle, altering the reactions of some NPCs in game altering ways (for example, the player may complete a quest, but not receive the greatest possible reward due to their low karma). Plot Setting Fallout is set in a timeline that deviated from between the end of World War II and the start of the Apollo program, where technology, politics, and culture followed a different course. While technology advanced, cultural and societal progress stagnated, giving the general world a Raygun Gothic appearance with advanced technology. In the mid-21st century, a worldwide conflict is brought on by global petroleum shortage. Several nations enter Resource Wars over the last of non-renewable commodities, namely oil and uranium from 2052 to 2077. China invades Alaska in the winter of 2066, causing the United States to go to war with China and using Canadian resources to supply their war efforts, despite Canadian complaints. Eventually, the United States violently annexes Canada in February 2076 and reclaims Alaska nearly a year later. After years of conflict, on October 23, 2077, a global nuclear war occurs. It is not known who strikes first, but in less than two hours most major cities are destroyed. The effects of the war do not fade for the next hundred years, and as a consequence, human society has collapsed leaving only survivor settlements barely able to eke out a living in the barren wasteland, while a few live through the occurrence in underground fallout shelters known as Vaults. One of these, Vault 13, is the protagonist's home in Southern California, where the game begins in 2161, 84 years after the war. Characters The player controls a Vault resident sent into the Wasteland to save their home. The player can create a custom protagonist or choose to be one of three already available: * Albert Cole, a negotiator and charismatic leader, whose background is somewhat in the legal system; * Natalia Dubrovhsky, a talented acrobat and intelligent and resourceful granddaughter of a Russian diplomat in the Soviet consulate in Los Angeles; * Max Stone, the largest person in the Vault, known for his strength and stamina, but lacking intelligence. Each of the three characters presents either a diplomatic, stealthy or combative approach to the game. Games set later in the Fallout series refer to the player's protagonist as \\"the Vault Dweller\\". Official canon states that the Vault Dweller was male, but his name is unspecified. The player is allowed to recruit four companions to aid them in their quest – Ian, a guard in Shady Sands, Tycho, a desert ranger in Junktown, Dogmeat, a dog in Junktown that was formerly pet of a man who bore a great resemblance to Max Rockatansky, and Katja, a member of the Followers of the Apocalypse, living in the remains of Los Angeles (now known as the Angels' Boneyard). Other characters in the game include Aradesh, the leader of Shady Sands, Killian Darkwater, the mayor of Junktown, the Master, the leader of the super mutant army, and Morpheus, his right hand as the leader of the Children of the Cathedral. Story In Vault 13, the Water Chip, a computer chip responsible for the water recycling and pumping machinery of the vault, malfunctions. With 150 days before the Vault's water reserves run dry, the Vault Overseer tasks the protagonist, the Vault Dweller, with finding a replacement. They are given a portable wristwatch-like computer called the \\"Pip-Boy 2000\\" that keeps track of map-making, objectives, and bookkeeping. Armed with the Pip-Boy 2000 and meager equipment, the Vault Dweller is sent off on the quest. The Vault Dweller has free rein across the Fallout world to travel where they wish and do what they like, but later games in the series clarify what the Vault Dweller canonically did. The Vault Dweller travels to Vault 15, the closest known Vault that may be able to provide help, but finds it collapsed into ruins and abandoned. The survivors of Vault 15 have founded a town named Shady Sands, and the Vault Dweller is given the option to defend them from the Khans, a group of raiders that attack the town, and radscorpions, mutated scorpions that plague the town's herds. The Vault Dweller then travels south to Junktown, where they can help the mayor, Killian Darkwater, bring the corrupt casino head Gizmo to justice, or help Gizmo assassinate Killian to take over the town. Further south the Vault Dweller finds The Hub, a bustling merchant city, where the Vault Dweller has the option to hire water caravans to aid Vault 13 and extend their estimated survival by 100 days. With clues from the Hub, the Vault Dweller travels to Necropolis, a city of mutated humans called ghouls who are under occupation by large mutated humans, dubbed Super Mutants. Under the city, the Vault Dweller finds Vault 12 and recovers a water chip. Upon returning with the chip, the Vault is saved, but the Overseer is concerned about the Vault Dweller's reports of the Super Mutants. Believing the mutations are too widespread and extreme to be natural, and that they pose a threat to the Vault, the Overseer charges the Vault Dweller to find the source of the mutations and stop them. The Vault Dweller finds and joins the Brotherhood of Steel - remnants of a top-secret genetic research program involving the U.S. Army that survived the war, and continues to research advanced technology. The Brotherhood supplies the Vault Dweller with equipment and information on the Super Mutants, which so happen to be directly related to the genetic research they conducted before the war: a mutagen called the Forced Evolutionary Virus, which can be used to mutate humans into Super Mutants, but leaves all such mutants sterile as a side effect. The Vault Dweller travels to the Boneyard - the ruins of Los Angeles - and finds out that the cult-like Children of the Cathedral operating around the Wasteland are a front created by the Super Mutants' Master, who is using the Children to preach his message to wastelanders and get them to submit to him peacefully. The Vault Dweller explores the Cathedral of the Children and finds a prototype Vault beneath it, from which the Master commands his Super Mutant army. Disguised as one of the Children, the Vault Dweller infiltrates the Vault and destroys the Master. The Vault Dweller travels north to a military base, where the Super Mutant army was using the Forced Evolutionary Virus to mutate humans into Super Mutants, bolstering their numbers. The Vault Dweller destroys the base, stopping the creation of more Super Mutants and splintering their army. The Vault Dweller returns to the Vault and is greeted at the entrance by the Overseer. The Overseer is happy that the Vault's safety is secured, but fears the Vault Dweller's experiences have changed them, and that hero worship of them in the Vault may encourage others to leave. For the greater good of the Vault and to preserve its isolation, the Vault Dweller is exiled into the Wasteland. If the Vault Dweller does not return to the Vault with the Water Chip before the Vault's water reserves run out, the player loses the game. In earlier versions of the game, if the Vault Dweller did not destroy the military base and the Master before 500 days passed, the mutants found Vault 13 and invaded it, resulting in an automatic loss. This time limit is shortened to 400 days if the Vault Dweller hires water caravans from the Hub, as the caravans traveling to the Vault allow the Super Mutant scouts to find it more easily. The 1.1 patch, and subsequent re-releases of the game, extend this time limit to 13 years, effectively giving the player enough time to do as they wish. There is also an optional alternate ending triggered if the Vault Dweller has a negative reputation or the \\"Bloody Mess\\" trait, where after the Overseer exiles him, the player character shoots and kills him. At various points of the game, the Vault Dweller also has the choice to join the Super Mutants, which results in a small video showing the Super Mutants rampaging through the Vault and ending the game. Development POV-Ray render mimicking Fallouts oblique projection and hexagonal grid In early 1994, Interplay Entertainment announced that they had acquired the license to create video games using the GURPS role-playing game system. Fallout was then created by Interplay as a spiritual successor to their 1988 post-apocalyptic role-playing game Wasteland. Although it was initially developed as an official sequel, Interplay did not have the rights to Wasteland at that point. The budget for the game was approximately US$3 million. In the early stages of planning, other settings based on the GURPS role-playing game handbooks were considered, including a time-travel theme with aliens and dinosaurs. According to producer Tim Cain, \\"[They] actually worked with the game designer who [wrote] the 'GURPS Time Travel' manual and worked out a complete time-travel adventure, but it was just too much artwork for [them] to get done in a reasonable amount of time.\\" The game's working titles included GURPS: Wasteland and Vault 13: A GURPS Post-Nuclear Adventure. The final title Fallout was suggested by the Interplay boss Brian Fargo. Tim Cain created the game engine and most of the design for the game. He worked on it, by himself, developing the mechanics of the design and incorporating the GURPS system, but that deal fell through. According to IGN, this was due to GURPS licensor Steve Jackson Games objecting to the excessive amounts of violence and gore included in the game, forcing Interplay to change the already implemented GURPS system to the internally developed SPECIAL system. According to Steve Jackson Games, this was a decision taken by Interplay, with no reason given. Cain said that they \\"all loved X-COM\\" and that the original version of Fallout (known as Vault 13, before the game was redesigned after they lost the GURPS license) featured combat very similar to the battles in UFO: Enemy Unknown. , GameSpot, 9 March 2012. The gaming media of the time also commented on the strong similarity to X-COM. Cain worked with fellow employees at Interplay in their spare time, starting in 1994. He built the engine alone in six months, given no money and no resources, only time. Later, Cain assembled a team of 30 people to work on the game for the next three years. The game was nearly canceled after Interplay acquired the licenses to the Forgotten Realms and Planescape Dungeons & Dragons franchises, but Cain convinced Interplay to let him finish the work on his project. Later, after the success of Diablo, Cain successfully resisted the pressure to convert the game to multiplayer and real-time based. The game was purposely balanced so that, while the sidequests are optional to progressing the main story, characters who did not improve their skills and experience by completing sidequests would be too weak to finish the game. To create the detailed talking heads, a sculptor built heads of clay, which the artists studied to determine which parts should be most heavily animated. The heads were digitized using a Faro Space Arm and VertiSketch, with LightWave 3D used for geometric corrections, while the texture maps were created in Adobe Photoshop. A number of well-known actors were cast as voice-talents. The game's narrations were performed by Ron Perlman, and the prologue featured one of the foremost iconic catchphrases of the game series: \\"War. War never changes\\"; Perlman was re-invited to narrate several later Fallout games. Other appearances included Richard Dean Anderson as Killian, David Warner as Morpheus, Tony Shalhoub (credited as Tony Shalub) as Aradesh, Brad Garrett as Harry, Keith David as Decker, Richard Moll as Cabot, and Tony Jay as The Mutant Lieutenant. The Master's unique way of speaking was due to his voice being computer-generated and sentences are composed from samples of several people's speech. Interplay intended to use \\"I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire\\" by The Ink Spots for the theme song, but could not license the song because of a copyright issue. This song was later licensed by Bethesda for Fallout 3. The song \\"Maybe\\" by the same artists was used instead for the original Fallout theme song. At one point in Fallouts development, in Junktown, if the player aided local sheriff Killian Darkwater in killing the criminal Gizmo, Killian would take his pursuit of the law much too far, to the point of tyranny, and force Junktown to stagnate. However, if the player killed Killian for Gizmo, then Gizmo would help Junktown prosper for his own benefit. The game's publisher did not like this bit of moral ambiguity and had the outcomes changed to an alternate state, where aiding Killian results in a more palatable ending. Fallout ultimately \\"took just under 4 years to make\\", according to Tim Cain. The game was released on October 10, 1997. Influences and references Fallout draws much from 1950s pulp magazines, classic science fiction films such as Forbidden Planet and superhero comics of Atomic Age: computers use vacuum tubes instead of transistors; energy weapons exist and resemble those used by Flash Gordon. Fallouts menu interfaces are designed to resemble advertisements and toys of the time period; for example, the illustrations on the character sheet mimic those of the board game Monopoly, and one of the game's loading screens is an Indian-head test pattern. There are also many references to various works of post-apocalyptic science fiction, such as Mad Max and Radioactive Dreams. One of the first available armors is a one-sleeved leather jacket that resembles the jacket worn by Mel Gibson in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. The player can also get a dog, as in Mad Max 2 and A Boy and His Dog, named Dogmeat. Fallout contains numerous Easter eggs referencing 1950s and 1960s pop culture. Many of these can be found in random encounters, which include a vanishing TARDIS from Doctor Who (complete with sound effect), an enormous reptilian footprint, and a crashed UFO containing a painting of Elvis Presley. The game also refers to other pieces of fiction, including WarGames and Blade Runner. Although the time frame of Wasteland is completely different from Fallout – and despite the fact that the game's designers deny that the Fallout franchise takes place in the same universe as Wasteland – there are many references to the events and the style of Wasteland in the Fallout series, which is why Fallout is sometimes regarded as a spiritual successor to Wasteland. For example, the protagonist can meet an NPC named Tycho, who mentions that he is a Desert Ranger and, under the right conditions, will talk of his grandfather, who told him about Fat Freddy, a character from Las Vegas in that game. The Master's original name (Richard Moreau) was derived from The Island of Dr. Moreau. Release The game, along with its two follow-ups, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, were later sold together as part of the Fallout Trilogy. Fallout and Fallout 2 also appeared together in \\"dual jewel\\" format. Reception Sales Fallout was a commercial success. In the United States, it debuted at #12 on PC Data's computer game sales rankings for October 1997. A writer for CNET Gamecenter noted that the game was part of a trend of role-playing successes that month, alongside Ultima Online and Lands of Lore 2: Guardians of Destiny. He remarked, \\"If October's list is any indication, RPGs are back.\\" Fallout totaled 53,777 sales in the United States by the end of 1997. Worldwide, over 100,000 units of the game had been shipped by December, and Erik Bethke later reported sales of \\"a little more than 120,000 units\\" after a year on shelves. By March 2000, 144,000 copies of the game had been sold in the United States alone. GameSpot's writer Desslock called these \\"very good sales, especially since the overall [worldwide] figures are likely double those amounts\\". Conversely, Fallout was unpopular in the United Kingdom: the game and its sequel totaled just over 50,000 combined lifetime sales in the region. According to Brian Fargo, sales of Fallout ultimately reached 600,000 copies. Critical reviews Fallout was met with a very favorable critical reception. Computer Gaming World called it \\"a game that clearly was a labor of love ... with humor, style, and brains to spare, and with a wonderfully refreshing emphasis on character development and decision making\\". GameSpot's reviewer wrote that \\"character creation system is detailed and thorough\\". Todd Vaughn of PC Gamer US wrote that the game's \\"tightly integrated mix of combat, storytelling and puzzling keeps the pace brisk and lively, and it'll keep you coming back for more\\". GamePro remarked, \\"Fallout brings old-school sensibilities to the electronic RPG realm, as well as great graphics and extremely adaptable gameplay.\\", giving it a 5.0 out of 5 for graphics and sound and a 4.5 for control and fun factor. According to Computer Games Strategy Plus, \\"in an age where many are predicting the death of traditional RPGs at the hands of multiplayer extravaganzas, Fallout is a glowing example of the genre, one which positively radiates quality\\". The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated Fallout for its \\"Personal Computer: Role Playing Game of the Year\\" and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music\\" awards, but gave these prizes to Dungeon Keeper and PaRappa the Rapper respectively. Similarly, the Computer Game Developers Conference nominated Fallout for its \\"Best Adventure/RPG\\" Spotlight Award, but this went ultimately to Final Fantasy VII. However, Fallout was named the best computer role-playing game of 1997 by Computer Gaming World, PC Gamer US, GameSpot and Computer Games Strategy Plus. It also received GameSpot's \\"Best Ending\\" prize. The editors of Computer Gaming World summarized it as \\"quite simply the best RPG to hit the PC in years\\". In 2015, IGN ranked the Vault Dweller meeting with the Master as the third best moment in by-then long-running Fallout series, noting these to be also some of the most memorable scenes in the entire history of gaming. Similarly, according to GamesRadar, \\"the climactic encounter between the player and the Master made [the game's Cathedral location] one of the most striking storytelling devices of its era.\\" Legacy In retrospect, CNET Gamecenter's Mark H. Walker wrote, \\"The RPG genre was clearly in a slump in the mid-'90s, but ... the renaissance began when Interplay's Fallout hit store shelves.\\" Over the years since its release, Fallout was ranked as the fourth (2001), tenth (2005), 13th (2007), 21st (2008) and seventh (2010) best PC game of all time by PC Gamer, fifth (2007) and 19th (2009) top PC game of all time by IGN, and 21st (2007) best PC game ever by PC Zone. IGN also ranked it as the 55th (2005) and 33rd (2007) top video game of all time overall,IGN Top 100 Games 2007 |33 Fallout as well as the 34th top RPG in 2013. Fallout has been inducted into \\"Hall of Fame\\" or equivalent of Computer Gaming World, GameSpot, GameSpy, and IGN, among others. In 2012, Fallout was exhibited as part of the Smithsonian American Art Museum's \\"The Art of Video Games\\" exhibition under the category of \\"adventure\\" games (along with Fallout 3). In addition, Fallout was included on the lists of top ten best endings and best game worlds by GameSpot in 2000, and top openings by Game Informer in 2008,\\"The Top Ten Video Game Openings,\\" Game Informer 187 (November 2008): 38. while Polish web portal Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the sixth most addictive classic game.6\\\\.

Very basic overnight accommodations and cooking facilities are available at the hut. It sleeps 25 people and has bunks, mattresses, wood stove, a kitchen with a gas stove for cooking and assorted pots and pans available for the visitor's use. Drinking and wash water is hauled from the lake in buckets; treatment is the individual visitor's responsibility. Light is from solar powered lights.

It is based on MPM-10001, a partial articulated skeleton missing the rear part of the skull, the tail, and the hands. Its most unusual feature is the presence of several thin mineralized plates along the sides of the ribs.  Description  Alternate view of skeleton Talenkauen was rather like Dryosaurus in shape and build, but with a proportionally longer neck. The full length of the body is estimated at no more than . Unlike more derived iguanodontians, it still had teeth in the tip of the beak (premaxillary teeth), and a first toe. More derived iguanodonts lose this toe, retaining only the three middle toes. The humerus has reduced areas for muscle attachment, a featured shared with other South American ornithopods like Notohypsilophodon and Anabisetia. This and other similarities to South American ornithopods suggests that there may have been a distinct Southern Hemisphere ornithopod group, but at the time the authors cautioned that such an interpretation was not entirely justified. In 2015, the describers of Morrosaurus found that such a clade did indeed exist.  Mineralized plates  Talenkauen's most distinct feature is a set of smooth, ovoid plates found along the side of the rib cage. These plates can be long (180 millimeters, or 7.1 in), but are very thin (only 3 millimeters thick [0.1 in]). They were present with at least the first eight ribs, attaching along the middle portion of a rib and lying flat. Several other dinosaurs are known to have had similar plates, including Hypsilophodon, Othnielosaurus, Parksosaurus, Thescelosaurus, and Macrogryphosaurus (also from Argentina, but from somewhat older rocks), which may have been related. Because of the fragility of the plates, and the fact that they may not have always turned to bone in the living animal, they may have been more widespread than currently known. Novas and colleagues suggested that the plates may be homologous to uncinate processes, strip-like bony projections found on the ribs of a variety of animals including the tuatara, crocodiles, birds, and some maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs. In birds, uncinate processes help to ventilate the lungs, working with rib cage muscles, and Novas and colleagues proposed a similar function for the plates of Talenkauen. This homology was rejected in a more recent study by Richard Butler and Peter Galton because of the plates' form. The plates were too thin and limited in location to have been very useful as defensive devices.  Classification  Through cladistic analysis, it was found to be more basal than Dryosaurus and Anabisetia, but more derived than Tenontosaurus and Gasparinisaura. More recently, the describers of Macrogryphosaurus found their genus and Talenkauen to be related, and coined the clade Elasmaria for the two genera. In 2015, several other Patagonian and Antarctic ornithopods were also found to be related. Cladogram based in the phylogenetic analysis of Rozadilla et al., 2015:  Palaeoecology  Reconstructed skeleton Talenkauen, as a basal iguanodont, would have been a small, bipedal herbivore. Other dinosaurs from the Pari Aike Formation include the giant titanosaurid Puertasaurus and the predatory neovenatorid Orkoraptor.

Moore was already active in the Birmingham rock, blues, folk and country scene, and played with numerous bands, including The Young Casuals, The Other Lot, The Outer Light, Gabriel Oak, Glad Stallion, Tendency Jones and Pendulum. He was first approached by guitarist K. K. Downing and bassist Ian Hill in 1971, and joined in the early and unofficial phase of the newborn Judas Priest for a period of about a year (during this time Al Atkins was still the vocalist). He left in 1972 to join the Birmingham country rock band, Sundance, with whom he recorded the album Rain, Steam, Speed (1974), and their single, \\"Coming Down\\". In 1975, drummer John Hinch left Judas Priest, and Downing and Hill re-approached Moore. For the second time, Moore joined the band, making him the only drummer in the history of Judas Priest to have two separate stints. His first show after re-joining was in 1975.10.11 - Slough College, London, UK, during which guitarist/backing vocalist Glenn Tipton introduced \\"our new drummer Skip\\" who \\"only had a few hours of rehearsal\\". In 1976, they recorded the album Sad Wings of Destiny. Despite the success of the album, Moore decided to leave again, only this time permanently. Moore continued to play with numerous other bands and recording sessions. In 1981 he signed to Ariola Records with the band R.P.M., releasing two singles: \\"Now That Summer's Here\\" and \\"Lost In Space.\\" After moving out of London he continued to play with various 'scratch bands' and session musicians. He later left music for a while and more or less faded into anonymity. He now lives with his wife and two sons on the Isle of Wight, playing blues and rock with Frank Aiello - previously front man with Cozy Powell, in the Baggywrinkles Blues Band which formed in 2016. Previously, several musical biographers, journalists, band members, and fans had tried to trace Moore without success. In the official biography The Story Of Judas Priest: Defenders Of The Faith, at the time it was written, author Neil Daniels said that Moore was the only former member of the band he could not trace at all.

Isle of Barra in the Outer Hebrides,Webber, Perry, Croft, p.228 an apparently desolate and bleakHe suggests this himself in the episode \\"No Spring for Frazer\\" Series Three, first broadcast 4 December 1969 place that appears to have informed most of his pessimistic, dark tendencies. In several episodes he tells stories of exploring the south seas, one story he tells during \\"Uninvited Guests\\" was when he and a friend of his called Jethro were sailing the south seas \\"nigh on 50 years\\" (making the story set in the early 1890s), Jethro heard of a deserted temple on an island near Samoa, which contained an idol with a giant ruby \\"the size of a Duck's egg\\", Jethro and Frazer encountered a witch doctor, who put a curse on Jethro for stealing the Ruby, shouting \\"DEATH! THE RUBY WILL BRING YE DEATH! DE-E-ATH\\". When Pike asks if the curse came true, Frazer stated it did, when Jethro died the previous year at the age of 86. He was a Chief Petty Officer in the Royal Navy during the First World War and was a Cook on board HMS Defiant during the Battle of Jutland. He also mentions that he was a member of the crew of a minesweeper and was responsible for shooting mines with a rifle from the ship and is shown to be a crack shot due to that (although he has to wave the gun up and down, because as he says \\"It's the only way I can shoot sir, this is the motion of the sea\\"). He moved to Walmington-on-Sea after the First World War, becoming the town's undertaker. Frazer makes no secret of his desires for increased rank and power within the platoon. To that end, Frazer is frequently negative and hyper-critical of his superior officers and their decisions, and clearly considers Captain Mainwaring, Sergeant Wilson and Lance Corporal Jones barely fit for command. When given even a little bit of power, however (or even just the taste of it), it frequently goes straight to his head; notably, in the episode \\"If the Cap Fits...\\", Frazer is temporarily given command of the platoon for a few days as an exercise in the difficulties of leadership, which, far from educating him in the pressures that Mainwaring faced, merely result in him acting even more exceedingly arrogant and tyrannical than before. In When Did You Last See Your Money?, a panic-stricken Jones was going to pieces over a missing £500, and Frazer was delighted, reminding people that he was next in line for Jones' position. In Something Nasty in the Vault, after Jones assumes control of the platoon following Mainwaring and Wilson's incapacitation, Frazer declares that he is second in command; something which goes undisputed by the rest of the platoon. Furthermore, in the missing episode A Stripe for Frazer, Frazer is promoted to Lance-Corporal.Webber, Perry, Croft, p.205 To reach his ends, Frazer is somewhat two-faced; he has a Machiavellian tendency to doubt people and their situations, and is usually responsible for gossiping and sowing the seeds of unease or insubordination amongst the other members of the platoon. His is usually the loudest voice of condemnation or criticism in any given situation - however, if and when his current target triumphs or is validated, he will instantly alter his position with a hasty \\"I never doubted you for a second\\", to ensure that he's never on the losing side. A prime example of this is his attitude in the episode \\"Branded\\", where his is the loudest voice of condemnation regarding Private Godfrey's conscientious objection and apparent 'cowardice' during the First World War, only for Frazer to immediately change his position when it transpires that Godfrey is nevertheless a decorated war hero. Another, less prominent, example is in \\"Sgt - Save My Boy!\\"; Frazer criticises Godfrey for fleeing \\"at the first sign of trouble\\", only to dub him \\"a man of steel... just like I've always said\\" when he sees Godfrey bypass the mine-infested beach on his own. In the episode \\"Getting the Bird\\", Frazer even shows a rare hint of self-awareness about his tendency to gossip; when he discovers that the young lady Wilson has been seen around town with is actually Wilson's daughter from a failed marriage, he admits that he's \\"an old blatherskite\\" and promises Wilson that he will never divulge his secret. A notoriously miserable and miserly soul, Frazer is known for his bleak, pessimistic outlook on life. In any situation where circumstances seem bleak for the platoon, he will never fail to find more reasons to feel doom. He will often find the time in the various predicaments that the platoon face to observe that their potential fate is \\"a terrible way to die\\", to note that \\"we're doomed\\" when peril is awaiting them or to regale the platoon with an anecdote of a much similar experience he is aware of that ended rather bleakly for all concerned. He also has quite a line in dark, atmospheric and rather long-winded tales which start promisingly with the lure of supernatural horrors and terrors, only to ultimately prove disappointing and end rather mundanely, such as the tales of 'The Auld Empty Barn' (there was nothing in it) and his friend Jethro, who apparently fell victim to a curse that ensured certain death; Jethro indeed did die at the age of 86. It was revealed in the episode \\"Operation Kilt\\" that he sports a tattoo on his arm which he claims \\"cost a fortune\\" and states \\"Scotland forever\\". It's also revealed in \\"When Did You Last See Your Money?\\" that he knows hypnosis, as he says \\"While I was sailing the China seas, I studied the art of hypnosis\\" and successfully hypnotises Lance-Corporal Jones. His main rivalries are with the other ageing members in the platoon, notably Corporal Jones, who fights back, and Private Godfrey, who doesn't. He has a more amenable relationship with Private Walker, who jokingly gives Frazer the nickname \\"Taffy\\" (a slang term for Welsh people, used by Walker as a playful dig at Frazer's Scottish heritage). He possesses a curious fascination with women who have \\"big, strong thighs.\\" Frazer does show a more generous side to his character when he saves Private Godfrey's cottage from being demolished to make way for a runway. When all hope seems lost, Frazer saves the day by threatening to reveal a senior politician's past indiscretions, although in typical Frazer style he doesn't let on that he was the hero of the hour. It is also reported that Frazer is President of the local Caledonian Society (he is the only one in it after he threw the other member out, for not paying his subscription when Frazer increased it). There are many misunderstandings with the Verger, for example in When Did You Last See Your Money? when the Verger sees him hypnotizing Lance Corporal Jones and believes he is practising black magic.

It serves residents of the Borough of Lewistown and communities to the borough's south and west. It is part of the Mifflin County School District.  History  In 1971, the Mifflin County School District merged the four high schools in the county into one. (Lewistown-Granville, Rothrock, Chief Logan, and Kishacoquillas) Since the school district did not have a building large enough to accommodate the combined student population, a new one was built. This building is now the present day Lewistown Area High School. The building was slated to be a state- of-the-art school for the time period; equipped with a large auditorium and balcony, and a television studio. It also featured an experimental \\"open classroom\\" design. There were no walls between classes of similar subjects. For example, all English classes (9th–12th grades) were in one large room, though students sat facing different directions. Eventually, room dividers were put in place and in the mid-1990s, permanent walls were constructed in the large rooms to resemble standard designs. In 1976, following the '75–'76 school year, Chief Logan High (which had been hosting half of the Penn Highlands students until completion of the new school) and Kishacoquillas High were restored. Since the Mifflin County School District built the open space Lewistown Area High School, the school district combined Lewistown-Granville High and nearby McVeytown's Rothrock High into one school and moved those students into the renamed present day Lewistown Area High School. In 1989, the Chief Logan and Kishacoquillas High Schools were combined to create Indian Valley High School. It is located at the former Chief Logan High School in Highland Park, Pennsylvania. The former Kishacoquillas High School is now the Indian Valley Middle School in Reedsville, Pennsylvania.

The type species is Gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis. It is believed to be a hadrosaur or iguanodont from the Iren Dabasu Formation of Inner Mongolia, dating to 96 Ma ago. Additional specimens have been described as distinct species, including G. atavus from the Khodzhakul Formation of Uzbekistan (120 Ma ago) and G. arkhangelskyi from the Bissekty Formation (89 Ma ago). However, these are based on very fragmentary remains, and their classification is dubious. An additional species, G. kysylkumense (also from the Bissekty Formation) is sometimes included, though it has also been referred to the related genus Bactrosaurus. History of study Asian expeditions and Gilmore's \\"Mandschurosaurus mongoliensis\\" Heavily reconstructed skeleton meant to represent \\"Mandschurosaurus amurensis\\", the type species of the genus Gilmoreosaurus was initially assigned to In the early twentieth century, the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) conducted a series of palaeontological expeditions to the deserts of Asia. One geologic formation where work was conducted during these expeditions was the Iren Dabasu Formation in Inner Mongolia, China. The fieldwork here was done by a field team led by Walter Granger. Nobody among them were specialists in dinosaurs; instead the AMNH had sent mostly geologists and mammal palaeontologists. Many dinosaur remains were discovered, but their nature would remain unknown to the discovers until experts back in America examined the material. The initial excavations of dinosaur fossils at Iren Dabasu took place on three days in April and May 1922. They conducted more extensive digs a year later from April 23 to June 1, 1923. Several new genera and species were discovered from the formation; among them were two new types of hadrosaur. It was these two that would later prove to be the most significant of the finds. They were among the first remains of the group from the continent, preceded only by Mandschurosaurus amurensis, Tanius sinensis, some remains from Turkestan and Saurolophus krischtofovici, with the validity of the latter species already doubted. The material that would eventually come to be known as Gilmoreosaurus was discovered by George Olsen (a member of Granger's team) in two different quarries (145 and 149, about apart), around northeast of the town of Erenhot and not far from the border with Mongolia. Several individuals were represented and between them most of the skeleton found, but the material was disarticulated and so what pieces belonged to each individual is not possible to determine for certain. Once it had arrived back to New York, the Mongolian material was given to Barnum Brown to study. Brown was renowned for his field collection of dinosaurs, but he was too busy to attend the Asian expeditions. He did extensive work on the material and had prepared names for the new species, but for unknown reasons he ceased work on the project before its completion. Instead, the fossils were sent to the Smithsonian and would be described and named as new species by Charles W. Gilmore. The Smithsonian had little in terms of a dinosaur fossil collection and Gilmore as such was more reliant on the literature than first hand comparisons in his studies. Despite this, his work in the field is considered to be of high quality. He published his findings in 1933, describing both hadrosaurs as well several other dinosaurs. One of the hadrosaurs, then thought to be a lambeosaur, was the novel genus Bactrosaurus. The second, known from at least four individuals and thought to be a hadrosaurine, was named as a new species of Mandschurosaurus, M. mongoliensis. This choice was made tentatively; Gilmore was mindful of the possibility his species may later require its own genus, but did not currently feel there was sufficient difference from M. amurensis for this. Gilmore's description of the species' anatomy was rather brief and would prove inadequate to understanding the taxon decades later; he provided no clear diagnosis (a list of what traits establish a species as different from its relatives). Another issue caused by Gilmore's work was that all the material, from all the individuals, was catalogued under a singular specimen number. Later palaeontologists thus had to recatalogue all of the elements under more modern standards. Museum of Ancient Life; skull material of this taxon proved to be a cornerstone of debate involving Gilmoreosaurus Following its original naming, Gilmore's species would remain poorly understood and received limited attention from other palaeontologists. Despite this, the occasions it was discussed often brought major taxonomic changes. One persistent issue surrounding the taxonomy of the Iren Dabasu hadrosaurs was the nature of cranial material found at the Bactrosaurus quarry. Gilmore assumed, based on its association with the rest of the Bactrosaurus material, that it must belong to that genus; no other elements at the site were inconsistent with just one species being present. He was perplexed, however, by its lack of a hollow-crest, something thought universal among lambeosaurs. He did consider the possibility it belonged to M. mongoliensis, and also noted its resemblance to specimens of the genus Tanius, but eventually discarded both ideas. C. C. Young revived the latter idea, and assigned the material to Tanius. Regarding Mandschurosaurus he agreed with Gilmore's referral of his species to the genus, and went further to say it's possible it actually represents the same species as M. amurensis. Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky, in the 1960s, considered a different solution; that Bactrosaurus was in fact a hadrosaurine, not a lambeosaurine. Furthermore, he thought that M. mongoliensis was merely a synonym of his hadrosaurine Bactrosaurus, a position he would continue to hold in future works. Future authors would disagree, reaffirming the two hadrosaurs as distinct and Bactrosaurus as a lambeosaur. Reclassification as Gilmoreosaurus and subsequent research Charles W. Gilmore, who first described the species; when it received its own genus, the taxon was named after him The next major change in taxonomy would come from Michael K. Brett- Surman, who was in the process of a revision of the entire hadrosaur family. Firstly, he provided a novel diagnosis for the species in his 1975 master's thesis. However, Brett-Surman considered Mandschurosaurus amurensis to be dubious; he therefore thought it necessary to give Gilmore's species a new generic name. As such, he coined the genus Gilmoreosaurus in 1979, honouring Gilmore, and created the new combination Gilmoreosaurus mongoliensis. He considered Gilmore's two hadrosaurs to be of great importance, something he elaborated on in a short 1980 paper. He described the anatomy of Gilmoreosaurus as \\"partly iguanodont and partly hadrosaurine\\" and saw it as the ancestral form of hadrosaurine; Bactrosaurus, likewise, was seen as the ancestral lambeosaur. It was based in part on the two species, as well as on Probactrosaurus, that he concluded that hadrosaurs had originated in Asia. One thing that interested Brett-Surman greatly was the similarity of the Asian fauna to the later fauna of the North American Two Medicine Formation; Gilmore had, in his 1933 paper, made similar comments about nature of Asian and American faunas. The 1980 paper noted that a lot of additional material from Iren Dabasu was never described by Gilmore, especially material pertaining to juvenile material. Brett-Surman reported that he and John R. Horner were at work investigating this material to form a more complete understanding of the formations' fauna. Referring to this, he concluded the paper by saying: \\"Although no more expeditions are possible to Mongolia by this time, light will be shed on the natural history of dinosaurs by further scientific expeditions to the basement of the natural history museum\\". Jack Horner was among the palaeontologists debating the nature of the Iren Dabasu material in the late 20th century Halszka Osmólska and Teresa Maryańska published a paper in 1981 which focused on Saurolophus angustirostris, but also provided comments on Asian hadrosaurs as a whole. Among these comments, they returned to the issue of the skull material. They disagreed the otherwise monospecific nature of the quarry (i.e. only one species seeming to be present) was stronger evidence than the discordant anatomy of the material. As such, they revived Young's model and tentatively assigned the material to Tanius, which they felt it fit most closely. They noted the skull may prove to belong to either Gilmoreosaurus or Bactrosaurus after additional research. This would come to be in 1985, when Horner and David B. Weishampel would re-examine the material of both Iren Dabasu genera as well material Gilmore never described, as had been indicated by Brett-Surman. Osmólska provided feedback on their study. The relevant new material was remains that the authors considered to be \\"clearly lambeosaurine\\" in nature, and so referrable to Bactrosaurus. As they could not possibly fit with the skull material, they concluded said material wasn't from the genus. Instead, they decided that it, congruent with its seemingly hadrosaurine nature, belonged to Gilmoreosaurus. At the end of the paper they reaffirmed the importance of both genera as the best record of early hadrosaurs. The issue would finally be put to rest by Pascal Godefroit and colleagues in 1998, when they published a study describing newly discovered Bactrosaurus material. They returned to the original position of Gilmore, that the possibility of two taxa in the Bactrosaurus type quarry was extremely remote and that the skull material belonged not to Gilmoreosaurus but Bactrosaurus. The reasoning for the paradoxical nature of the anatomy was that Bactrosaurus was not a lambeosaur or even hadrosaurid at all but instead a more primitive form of hadrosauroid merely convergent with its later relatives. They remarked that it would be informative to test the phylogenetic affinities of Gilmoreosaurus as well, but that it was too poorly described to allow this. Modern review of the species was considered to be direly needed. Seeking to finally resolve the longstanding issue, Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark A. Norrel began work on a thorough redescription of Gilmoreosaurus; this was published in 2010. Resolving its phylogenetic position was a priority and the ultimate motive behind the endeavor. All known material of the genus was examined for the study. One thing allowed by the redescription was a modern diagnosis of G. mongoliensis, as the 1975 one was found to be lacking. They also specifically touched on the idea the two Iren Dabasu hadrosaurs could be synonyms as Rozhdestvensky had thought. This idea was rejected, with numerous differences between the two found. Studies since the redescription have been able to include Gilmoreosaurus in research on hadrosaur phylogeny. Description Size compared to a 1.8 m tall human Gilmoreosaurus was a relatively large-sized hadrosauroid which could grow up to long and obtain weights between . Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information The genus can be distinguished from other hadrosauroid taxa in having a very reduced paddle- shaped postacetabular process and an asymmetrical manual phalanx III-1 end. Although the preserved elements are very sparse and probably representing more than one individual, the specimen AMNH FARB 30729 represents a single animal composed by a left ulna and radius. Crania and dentition Right maxilla of AMNH FARB 30653 (reversed) in lateral view. Maxillary foramina indicated by arrows A complete skull articulated is not known from the multiple specimens, however, numerous elements are known such as the right maxilla, dentary, jugal, squamosal and two lacrimals, quadrate and a complete predentary. In a lateral view, the right maxilla of specimen AMNH FARB 30653 is triangular in shape with various foramina on the surface. On the inner side 26 alveolar foramen are preserved and 22 alveoli are filled with teeth but the total count may be unknown due to incompleteness, the surface of this side is rather flat. The teeth are oval-shaped with a moderately pinched upper end and have coarse denticles, these denticles have three diminutive pointed structures. It appears to be that the dentary teeth were more flattened with a pinched lower end as indicated by nine isolated teeth. In all teeth, a ridge-like structure is located at the center. An isolated and partial right jugal is represented by AMNH FARB 30657, which has lost most of the anterior area in the rostral joint. It has a triangular-shaped form in a lateral view and flattened to the inner sides. The partial rostral joint is square and the lateral surface is somewhat concave but in the medial surface the articulation for the maxilla can be identified. The upper surface of the rostral joint forms a flattened socket-like structure that continues towards the rear with the base of the postorbital ramus. This ramus is projected to the top and slightly tilted towards the rear. The upper portion of the postorbital ramus is triangular when seen from the cross-section. Towards the lower end, the anterior surface of the ramus is clipped with a triangle-like pit that wedges towards the bottom to configurate the lower end of the jugal ramus of the postorbital. Predentary of AMNH FARB 6369 in bottom view There are two lacrimal bones preserved from specimens AMNH FARB 30655 and 30656. Overall, the left lacrimal of AMNH FARB 30655 is wedge-shaped in a lateral view, denoting the anterior shape of the orbit, and flattened from the inner side to the lateral one. The top surface is thin and overlapped by the ventral border of the premaxilla joint that is developed from the rear to the bottom. On the bottom surface, a large and elliptical foramen is visible, allowing the connection for the rostral joint of the jugal. On the posterior surface another foramen is present, ending on the ventral surface where the exit is located. These foramina are connected through the lacrimal channel. The right squamosal is labelled as AMNH FARB 30658. The main body is subtriangular with the lateral surface being gently convex. In contrast, its lower inner surface is more concave and cross-cutted by a minor ridge-like structure. As a whole, the squamosal is flattened from the inner side to the top. There are three projections coming from the main body, which can be identified as the anterior postorbital joint, the lateral postcotyloid joint and the inner ramus. However, only the lower part of the postorbital joint is preserved. The precotyloid opening is absent, but this feature is very variable in both Hadrosauroidea and Hadrosauridae. Maxillar tooth Two quadrate bones are preserved (specimens AMNH FARB 30659 and 30660). It is very straight in general with only a gentle curvature on the posterior border. The articular surface of the head is triangle-shaped and flatted to the lateral side. A relatively large, ridge-like formation can be observed on the posterior edge near the top, likely supporting the squamosal. This character is also reported in other iguanodontians and hadrosauroids, such as Brachylophosaurus or Gryposaurus. The lateral surface of the quadrate is flat and on the anterior border a cut for the quadratojugal can be identified, however, most of its articular borders are lost except a small dorsal area and a long bottom surface. A right dentary is represented by specimen AMNH FARB 30654, a partial element with a badly eroded dental battery. It preserves about 15 alveoli of which none is filled with teeth. The total dentary teeth count on Gilmoreosaurus was probably less than 30 and the tooth row is oriented to the lateral sides as seen in other hadrosauroids, unlike the more advanced hadrosaurids. The upper toothless border of the dentary and a significant portion of the articular border for the predentary are missing, but given that both of these borders have minor lengths—about less than the 25% of the length of the dental battery—they indicate that the toothless area between the tooth row and the predentary was rather reduced—another trait present in hadrosauroids but lost in hadrosaurids. The predentary is represented by a complete element of specimen AMNH FARB 6369, which has a U-shaped form. Numerous and pointed denticles are preserved on the dorsal surface of the predentary, giving a serrated texture. Vertebral column Anterior and posterior dorsal vertebrae from AMNH FARB 30680-30683) The vertebral column is represented by four cervical, ten dorsal, seven sacral and thirty three caudal vertebrae of several specimens. The vertebrae are mostly similar to those of other hadrosauroids but some traits can be noted. The cervical vertebrae of specimens AMNH FARB 30671-30673 have centra that are opisthocoelous (concave on their posterior sides), heart-shaped in a posterior view and flattened on the inner side. The centra of the anterior dorsals in AMNH FARB 30674-3068 appear to be less opisthocoelous but they also have heart-shaped facets. The neural spines are very elongated and subrectangular in shape, they are slightly curved to the posterior side. In the middle and posterior dorsals of AMNH FARB 30681-30685 the neural spines are more straight and thicker. The preserved sacrum is composed by three elements, three fused vertebrae, four fused neural spines and four fused centra. Being relatively elongated, the centra in the three fused vertebrae are platycoelus (slightly concave at both ends) and have the lineal heart-shaped facets. When seen from the bottom surface, a ridge-like structure is located at the center as in Bactrosaurus, Claosaurus or Iguanodon. The neural canal—where the spinal cord passes through—is very large and expanded to the bottom. The four fused neural spines form a compact element, having very thickened and relatively elongated spines. The last sacral element is represented by four fused centra. These centra are widened to the lateral sides and while the posterior facet is lightly concave, the anterior one is more flattened. Lastly, the caudal vertebrae have very flattened centra with smally neural canals and neural spines that are projected towards the rear, although these traits become progressively marked towards the tail end as seen in many other iguanodontians.  Limbs and limb girdles Right humerus (1) of AMNH FARB 30728 and left ulna (2) with radius (3) of AMNH FARB 30729 The pectoral area is represented by both scapulae and coracoids from several specimens as well. In general, the coracoid has a oval- shaped form with a prominent coracoid foramen through which the supracoracoid nerve passes and the glenoid is D-shaped. The bottom articulation is shortened and triangular, as well as directed to the bottom area rather than hooked from the rear to the bottom in a lateral as in many other hadrosauroids and not hadrosaurids. The scapula is very straight in a top view with its inner surface being flattened throughout most of the length. The scapular blade is not particularly elongated and is somewhat rounded at its end which seems to be a common trait in hadrosauroids except for Bactrosaurus. The proximal constriction, the area of the scapula lying between the proximal region and the distal blade, is very narrow; its breadth is about half the width of the proximal region. The putative acromion process is slightly tilted forwards. The deltoid ridge—a ridge-like structure on the humerus where the deltoid muscle is attached—is well developed and extends from the acromion process to the bottom edge of the scapular blade. The coracoid facet is concave and subrectangular shape. The glenoid is concave and more elongated than its width. The humerus is a relatively stocky and robust bone. Its main articular head is expanded from the inner side to the lateral one and proximally offset relative to its proximolateral corner. The deltopectoral crest—where the deltoid muscle was attached to the upper front of the humerus—is developed to the lower side from the upper half of the humerus, and its bottom extension has a total width diameter of the humeral shaft ratio of 1.67. The lateral border of the deltopectoral crest is very thick towards the bottom border. However, as a whole, this crest is relatively shortened in length. In cross- section, the humeral shaft is elliptical in shape and gently flattened to the lateral surface. A large tuberosity can be observed on the posterior surface of the humerus—about 1/3 the distance from the upper end. The lower end of the humerus is expanded to the lateral side forming the ulnar and radial condyles. The ulnar condyle is more wider and expanded than the radial one and these two condyles are separated by a shallow depression on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the lower end of the humerus. The radius is subcylindrical in shape with expanded upper and lower ends. The articulation surfaces of this bone with those of the ulna in AMNH FARB 30729 match perfectly, indicating that they represent the same individual. Both bottom and top surfaces in the radius are triangular and shape but the former is more flattened. The lower end is more expanded than the upper one and is also triangular in cross- section. Additionally, the articular lower surface of the radius is triangular and has striations. The ulna is shortened compared to other hadrosauroids. It is expanded at its upper and lower ends and the dorsal surface of the upper third shows a shallow depression that likely served as the attachment site for the upper end of the radius. The inner surface is very concave in shape. The middle and lower regions of the shaft change from wider to more expanded near the lower end of the ulna. The latter is nearly equal in thickness as the upper end. The lower fifth of the ulna has a flattened articular surface for the radius that faces from the inner to the top facets and shows elongated striations. Right ilium of AMNH FARB 30736 in lateral view featuring the supraacetabular process Though very fragmented, the manus is represented by the left metacarpal IV with two right phalanges. The metacarpal is very short—more so than what is known in other hadrosauroids—and has a gently tilted shape. The upper end is more broad than the lower one and its articular surface is rather round. Phalanx II-1 is fairly elongated and has concave articular surfaces. However, phalanx III-1 is much shorter than the previous elements, having a semi-square shape and being wider than long. Its articular surfaces are more convex. The ilium is elongated and shallow in shape with its preacetabular process (anterior expansion of the iliac blade) also being long and deflected towards the bottom. The upper region of this process is deep. The shape of the top border of the ilium has a degree of variability among specimens. The supraacetabular process (a bony projection at the top border of the ilium) has an asymmetrical, v-shaped appareance in profile and its lateral projection is tilted to the bottom. This process also develops near the upper region of the postacetabular process (posterior expansion of the iliac blade). The pubic peduncle—a robust process in front of the acetabulum—is triangular in shape and expanded from the inner to lateral surfaces. The ischiac peduncle, which is a lesser process located just behind the acetabulum, shows a well-developed tuberosity towards the top surface. When compared, the preacetabular process is much more elongated and developed than the posterior one. The ischium is notoriously elongated and has a wide and robust iliac peduncle—tubercle-like structure that connects to the ilium. Its anterior and posterior borders are gently similar upwards. Being more broad than the iliac peduncle, the pubic peduncle is very flattened from the inner to lateral sides and its articular surface faces towards the bottom. The lower end of the ischium has a characteristic \\"foot-like\\" expansion and though its bottom border is eroded, enough is preserved to tell that it was not greatly expanded in this area.There is only a single pubis that has lost most of its areas due to erosion. Both ischial and pubic peduncles are separated by the rounded acetabular border of the pubis. A vast majority of the bone is losing the lower end, however, it is clear this region was not particularly rounded. Tibia (2) of AMNH FARB 30742 and femur (3) of AMNH FARB 30741 The femur is a straight and robust element that is gently curved to the inner side. This element is mostly similar in build to other hadrosauroids with a well- developed fourth trochanter and lateral-inner condyles. The latter two are separated by grooves. The anterior trochanter is elongated and large, being forwards offset and excluded from the lateral surface of the upper region of the femur by a fissure. One of the most common elements among the collection is represented by the tibia—about six elements. It is a robust element that is slightly shorter than the femur, and is composed of a rather cylindrical shaft that is expanded at both upper and lower ends; more expanded at the latter though. The cnemial crest is very elongated and developed near the upper end of the bone. A main difference between the juvenile and adult tibiae can be noted by the bottom tilt of the lateral malleolus—this trait is less developed in juveniles. Another character less developed in juveniles is the definition and sharpness of the distal margin of the cnemial crest. Furthermore, the upper inner condyle of the tibia is reduced in juveniles. The fibula is particularly straight and elongated. It is flattened to the lateral side and the upper end is more expanded than the lower one. While the lateral surface is gently convex, the inner one bears a long depression near the upper region. On the lower end, a flat articular surface can be located and is tilted forwards. Among the tarsal elements, the astragalus is the largest. It has an irregular shape with well-developed processes, and the articular surface for the fibula is shallowed. The calcaneum is square in shape and divided into four different surfaces. Among them, the upper surface articulates with the fibula and is separated from the tibial articular surface by a curved ridge- like structure. Composite reconstruction of the right pes (several specimens) Among the metatarsus elements, metatarsal III and IV are present. The former is composed of a rather stocky shaft that has expanded upper and lower ends. Its upper articular surface is D-shaped, and the upper half of the inner surface shows a notorious depression for the articulation with metatarsal II. On the bottom surface of this metatarsal, a large ridge-like structure is present and extends along the upper two-thirds of the element. The lateral and inner surfaces of the lower end of metatarsal III are concave—mostly on the inner one—and subcircular. Metatarsal IV is fairly more slender than the previous element and its shaft is flattened from the top to bottom regions. The upper articular surface is concave and also D-shaped, with equal widened top and bottom borders. The bottom-most surface of the bone is concave and the medial one features a large tuberosity upwards to the mid-length. The lower end is nearly equally in its expansions and the articular surface is downwards convex and less concave to the lateral surface than in metatarsal III. The lateral and inner surfaces of the lower end of metatarsal IV have an oval shape and are very concave. Pedal phalanges II-1 through IV-1 are stout and show triangular-shaped and concave upper surfaces. Among the three uppermost phalanges, II-1 is the deepest. Phalanx III-1 is downwards flattened and has a subelliptical upper articular surface. Pedal phalanx II-2 is a robust element that wider than long. Its upper surface is relatively smooth and concave. The bottom border of this surface is further extended backwards in relation to the top border. Two lower phalanges belong to digit IV. These phalanges are even more flattened than phalanx II-2. Their lower and upper surfaces are similar to those of phalanx II-2, but can be differentiated in being more concave. Pedal unguals are mostly flattened and convex with elliptical upper surfaces. These elements are more arrow-shaped and more sharply developed than in hadrosaurids. The unguals of digits II and IV are asymmetrical, with more elongated inner and lateral flanges, and longer upper regions. Classification Although a consensus on the exact taxonomic placement of this genus remains unreached, a 2010 study by Prieto-Márquez and Norell places the animal in a closely related outgroup to Hadrosauridae, based on a reassessment of its taxonomic status using a large-sample phylogenic analysis. Palaeobiology In 2003, evidence of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma was discovered in fossilized Gilmoreosaurus skeletons. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Edmontosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000 fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to Gilmoreosaurus and closely related genera. The tumors may have been caused by environmental factors or genetic propensity. Paleoenvironment Gilmoreosaurus is known from the Late Cretaceous Iren Dabasu Formation, which has been dated back to the Cenomanian stage around 95.8 ± 6.2 million years ago. During its times, the formation was dominated by braided floodplains and large meanders with some connections to the oceans. Extensive vegetation that maintained a great variety of herviborous dinosaurs was also present on the formation as seen on the multiple skeletons of hadrosauroids, the prominent paleosol and the numerous palynological occurrences. Hadrosauroid remains are very common across the formation, which reflect these animals as wide-ranging in both time and space. Bactrosaurus is another hadrosauroid from the formation, known from multiple specimens like Gilmoreosaurus. Ponderous herbivorous animals like Gilmoreosaurus and Bactrosaurus may have been medium to low-level browsers. Fellow herbivores include the therizinosaurids Erliansaurus and Neimongosaurus. Gigantoraptor, a large oviraptorosaur from the formation, may have been an omnivore as suggested by the mandibular morphology or at least, a partial high-browser. The geographic range of Gilmoreosaurus overlapped with the fast-running tyrannosauroid Alectrosaurus, likely being the prey item for this theropod.

It is known from the partial skeletons of several individual specimens. Its fossils were discovered in Utah, United States. The type species for the genus is Planicoxa venenica, first described by Tony DiCroce and Kenneth Carpenter in 2001. Its discovery was made in the Poison Strip Sandstone Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation in Grand County, Utah, United States. Planicoxa refers to the flat appearance of the ilium formed by horizontal folding over of the postacetabular process (rear portion of the ilium), the defining characteristic of the genus; venenica, the species name, is Latin for “poison” in reference to the Poison Strip Sandstone Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation where the discovery was made. This new taxon is represented by a well-preserved ilium, femora, tibiae, and vertebrae, as well as other material. The femora are classical ornithopod, but the ilium has a short, horizontal postacetabular process that is functionally an antitrochanter. The discovery of P. venenica adds significant new information to the Barremian-Albian fauna of the Cedar Mountain Formation. A second species, P. depressa, was created by Carpenter and Wilson (2008) for material previously named Camptosaurus depressus by Charles Gilmore in 1909. That material was collected from the Lakota Formation near the town of Hot Springs, South Dakota. It too has the odd flat ilium formed by the horizontal postacetabular process. This species differs from P. venenica in that the ilium is not as arched, has a thicker (more robust) preacetabular process (long, forward projection of the ilium), a shallower acetabular notch (hip- socket), and a proportionally narrower brevis shelf (a shelf for muscles on the inside of the rear part of the ilium). It is known from some vertebrae and two ilia. Isolated iguanodontid bones from the Lakota Formation probably belong to this species. In 2011, it was assigned to its own genus, Osmakasaurus.

Background Richmond was born the second of five sons of a pioneer physician, Albert and Etta Richmond in Ogallala, Nebraska.Ted Richmond's Wilderness Library. http://www.wildernesslibrary.org/ (accessed November 27, 2006). In 1894 after years of drought, the family moved to Fort Madison, Iowa. In Iowa Richmond became fascinated with outdoor life and would often travel around with migrant workers listening to their stories and preaching the Gospel. Richmond was active in the Boy Scouts of America and started many Scout troops in his travels around the Midwest. Seeking a greater education, Richmond traveled to Chicago and attended school at the University of Chicago for a period of time. World War I Richmond joined the (AEF) American Expeditionary Force and was stationed in France during World War I. After the war, he stayed in France and spent one year attending the University of Toulouse. During that time period, he also helped establish one of the many libraries at the University. Chicago newspaperman After returning to the United States after World War I, Richmond worked as a newspaperman and wrote radio plays. After several years he grew disenchanted with the life of the big city and its focus on material possessions. Having spent much of his youth being involved with the Boy Scouts and his love of the outdoors, he read the story \\"The Shepherd of the Hills\\" by Harold Bell Wright and an article by Horace Kephart about camping in the Ozarks. These books greatly influenced him and he decided to give up the big city life and find himself again in the hills of the Boston Mountains in Arkansas. Richmond migrated to Springfield, Missouri, in the Missouri Ozarks. While in Springfield, he continued his education and attended what is now known as Missouri State University. Ozark life and the Boston Mountains In 1931, Richmond relocated to Mount Sherman, Arkansas, and homesteaded land located on the north slope, in what he called \\"the cove\\". He built a cabin which he lovingly called the \\"Wildcat Cabin\\" because of the bobcat that followed him on his journey to locate a suitable building site. Richmond immediately formed a kinship with the native Arkansasans. Richmond was a worldly man in a land that saw very little of the outside world. He began several quests that were dear to his heart, doctoring and education. He began writing people describing his need for books and magazines that offered reading material of the hill folks. Later years Richmond married Edna Garner, Chief Deputy Clerk of the Courts of Civil Appeals of the 6th Supreme Judicial District Court of Texas at Texarkana, in 1953. They lived in Texarkana and Richmond would spend summers on Mount Sherman in Arkansas tending to his Wilderness Library. Richmond died in a nursing home in Texarkana, Texas, at the age of 85. He is buried in a Texarkana, Texas cemetery.

During his lifetime he wrote and directed more than 40 short animated films and several live-action feature films, and was also a popular illustrator, children's book illustrator, painter, graphic artist, comics artist and caricaturist. Dinov was born to a Bulgarian family in Dedeagach in Western Thrace (today Alexandroupoli, Greece) and finished school in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. He studied at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow under the tutelage of distinguished Soviet animators such as Ivan Ivanov-Vano. Dinov created his own first animated film, Yunak Marko (English: Marko the Hero), in 1955. Perhaps his best-known animated film in the West is the five-minute short Margaritka (English: The Daisy), produced in 1965. The film features a square-shaped little man trying to cut down a daisy and failing, then becoming more and more enraged as he tries increasingly brutal methods against the flower; in the end, the daisy only responds to the love of a child. Oddly, Margaritka won a prize for best children's film even though it was meant for adults. In 1967 he was a member of the jury of the 5th Moscow International Film Festival. He founded the first animation studio in Bulgaria, setting the highest quality professional standards for producing animation in his country. Later, he created the Animation Department (now a separate major) and taught animation classes at the Theatre and Film Arts Institute. Dinov was also a member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In 1999, Dinov was awarded the highest-rank Bulgarian medal -- the Stara Planina order (First Degree). In 2003 he received the Crystal Pyramide Award of the Bulgarian Filmmaker Union for lifetime achievement to the art of Bulgarian animation. He died in Sofia at the age of 84.

Trahlyta supposedly drank from a nearby Fountain of Youth to maintain her renowned beauty. The warrior Wahsega courted her, but Trahlyta rejected his courtship, and the angered warrior kidnapped and imprisoned Trahlyta in some unknown location away from the beauty's mountain home. Trahlyta longed to see her home again, but her captor did not relent, and she grew weak and died. Her dying wish, according to the legend, was to be buried in the mountain forests whence she came. According to the historical marker at the site of her supposed grave, \\"custom arose among the Indians and later the Whites to drop stones, one for each passerby, on her grave for good fortune.\\" Today there is a pile of stones reaching at least five feet high. Trahlyta's beloved home was said to be in the vicinity of Cedar Mountain. Her \\"fountain of youth\\" is often associated with nearby Porter Springs, where a resort community operated in the late 1800s and early 1900s for people who believed the waters had healthful properties. The site of the rockpile over her alleged grave, complete with a historical marker, is called Stonepile Gap. These are all minor tourist attractions.

It is known from a tooth and possibly some postcranial remains found in the early-Aptian Kalahari Deposits Formation. \\"Table 19.1,\\" in Weishampel, et al. (2004). Page 417. It was probably similar to Dryosaurus. Description and history Kangnasaurus was named in 1915 by Sidney H. Haughton. The type species is Kangnasaurus coetzeei. The generic name refers to the Kangnas farm; the specific name to the farmer, Coetzee. Kangnasaurus is based on holotype SAM 2732, a tooth found at a depth of 34 metres in a well at Farm Kangnas, in the Orange River valley of northern Cape Province, South Africa. The age of these rocks, conglomerates in an ancient crater lake, is unclear; they are thought to be from the Early Cretaceous (probably ealy-Aptian). Haughton thought SAM 2732 was a tooth from the upper jaw, but Michael Cooper reidentified it as a lower jaw tooth in 1985. This had implications for its classification: Haughton thought the tooth was that of an iguanodontid, while Cooper identified it as from an animal more like Dryosaurus, a more basal ornithopod. Haughton described several other fossils as possibly belonging to Kangnasaurus. These include five partial thigh bones, a partial thigh bone and shin bone, a partial metatarsal, a partial shin and foot, vertebrae, and unidentified bones. Some of the bones apparently came from other deposits, and Haughton was not certain that they all belonged to his new genus. Cooper was also not certain, but described the other specimens as if they did belong to Kangnasaurus. Kangnasaurus is usually regarded as dubious, although a 2007 review of dryosaurids by Ruiz-Omeñaca and colleagues retained it as potentially valid, differing from other dryosaurids by details of the thigh bone. Like other basal iguanodontians, it would have been a bipedal herbivore.

She appeared from 1987 to 1988, from the age of 11 to 13. Coco was often paired with Joey Dee for duets. She had replaced Vanessa Windsor on the show and was the 35th member to join. After the show's demise, Coco worked with a professional cover band on a regular basis until her final year of high school (Year 12). She then formed a young band, Milk, who were working on original songs and about to start performing at the time of her death in 1993. Death On 2 May 1993, Juanita Coco attended her boyfriend, Scott Tiedgens', 20th birthday party in North Melbourne. At the end of the evening, she got into a Subaru wagon driven by a female friend of another guest, accompanied by Tiedgen, and his friend, Brad Lacey, 21 years old, and two other friends. As the vehicle travelled through Malvern, it ran a red traffic light and was broadsided by another vehicle. Sitting in the back seat, Coco and Lacey were killed instantly due to the force of the impact. Note: article incorrectly shows Coco as 18. The driver survived with no injuries and Tiedgen survived with serious injuries. Coco was 17 when she died. A subsequent investigation found that the driver of the Subaru was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident; manslaughter charges were later dropped in court. Legacy Juanita Coco's mother Jenny Coco and her husband Patrick formed The Friends of the Donor Tissue Bank of Victoria, following their daughter's donation of heart valve and corneas. Jenny, accompanied by a scientist from the Tissue Bank, gave talks to groups about the personal side of tissue donation and the importance of discussing it with family. Since her death, her former high school, St Helena Secondary College, has presented, The Juanita Coco lnspiration Award, to the person(s) who avidly carry on the spirit of Coco in their annual musical production.

Personal life Goonan was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the setting of her first novel, and at age eight moved to Hawaii, the setting for her second novel, while her father worked for the Navy for two years.Locus Magazine interview excerpt page, accessed online. She currently divides her time between the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee and the Florida Keys with her husband, Joseph Mansy, whom she married in 1977. She has a degree in English Literature and Philosophy from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and following graduation, received an Association Montessori Internationale teaching certification from the Montessori Institute in Washington, D.C., and then opened a Montessori school in Knoxville. Following a later move to Hawaii, she became a full-time writer. She is currently a Professor of the Practice of Creative Writing and Science Fiction at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Fiction Goonan is best known for novels which give snapshots taken at different times of a world where nano- and biotechnologies (\\"bionan\\") produce deep changes in humans and their habitat. She explores themes of cultural and social change and catastrophe. She is a great lover of jazzio9. Strung out on science fiction. online magazine. and music in general, and peppers her tales with references to (and reincarnations of) the likes of Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, and Sun Ra. Goonan's first novel Queen City Jazz (Tor) was published in 1994 to critical acclaim including from cyberpunk SF writer William Gibson who described it as \\"An unforgettable vision of America transfigured by a new and utterly apocalyptic technology.\\" It was a New York Times Notable Book for 1994 and a finalist in 1998 for the British Science Fiction Association Award. It became the first book in what she would later call her Nanotech Quartet. Because of Gibson's praise, her work has sometimes grouped with cyberpunk. However, she deals little with computers in her novels, and her characters, such as Verity, the protagonist of Queen City Jazz, are positive and sometimes heroic, while cyberpunk concerns itself with anti-heroes. This has led to some SF critics dubbing a new subgenre called nanopunk. While her second novel 1996's The Bones of Time (Tor) featured some elements of nanotechnology science within it, it is not part of the Quartet, and was not centered on these ideas. Instead it mixes Hawaiian mythology with a spy thriller type chase through Asia centered on the cloning of one of Hawaii's native rulers. This novel was an Arthur C Clarke Award finalist. Mississippi Blues (Tor) followed in 1997 as a direct sequel to Queen City Jazz following the further adventures of her main character Verity along a Mississippi River radically changed by malfunctioning nanotech. It is somewhat of a tribute to the great American author Mark Twain who appears in the book as two separate characters who have been programmed with nanotech into believing they are him. This novel won the Hall of Fame Darrel Award in conjunction with her short story \\"The Bride of Elvis\\" for their contribution to speculative fiction set in the Mid-South of America. Crescent City Rhapsody (HarperCollins) was published in 2000 as a prequel, explaining how the world of Queen City Jazz came about as the U.S. government conspired to sweep in nanotechnology that was not tested for possible side effects. It was a finalist for the Nebula Award, and received high praise from her peers including such genre authors as Joe Haldeman, Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, and Stephen R. Donaldson. Much of the novel takes place in New Orleans, and it is particularly haunting to read today as the book ends with the levees breaking and the city flooding, penned five years before Hurricane Katrina struck. Light Music, published in 2002 (HarperCollins), concludes the Nanotech Quartet. This novel looks at the further evolution of humanity under the influence of \\"bionan\\", and ties it in with an alien presence apparently responsible for \\"El Silencio\\", the great radio silence of Crescent City Rhapsody that paved the way for the nanotech takeover. Light Music received a starred review in Booklist and was also reviewed in the New York Times. Once more, other science fiction authors spoke highly of her work including Kim Stanley Robinson, David Brin, and, again, William Gibson. In War Times, published in 2007 (Tor), is set in World War II. This novel represents a major departure from her nanotech novels, mixing elements of historical fiction with the alternate history subgenre of science fiction. There is no mention of nanotech in the book, though it does deal with other technology both real and theoretical throughout the novel. In War Times is centered on secret technologies used during the war and extrapolates on what might have happened if some of those had surpassed atomic tech and created a lasting peace instead of a Cold War. Without ever using the specific term, Goonan clearly considers the concept of the multiverse first postulated by American philosopher and psychologist William James in 1895 and now a serious theory within physics. This novel was chosen by the American Library Association as Best Science Fiction Novel for their 2008 reading list. It also was the winner of the 2008 John W. Campbell Memorial Award. Goonan's novelette \\"Creatures with Wings\\" appeared in the 2010 anthology Engineering Infinity, edited by Jonathan Strahan. Her novelette \\"Wilder Still, the Stars\\" was published in Strahan's 2014 anthology Reach for Infinity. Goonan's newest novel, This Shared Dream, published in 2011, continues the story from In War Times. The three Dance children are now adults and coping with being seemingly abandoned by their parents. All three are disturbed by memories of a reality that existed in place of their world. Jill, the eldest daughter, even remembers the disappearance of their mother while preventing the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Key characters from In War Time make appearances in This Shared Dream while trying to thwart the machinations of an unseen enemy bent on using the Hadntz Device to alter history for their ends. This Shared Dream received a glowing review by Michael Dirda of The Washington Post.

The present monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, who is also the head of state of fifteen other Commonwealth realms. The Queen's constitutional roles in Solomon Islands are delegated to the Governor-General of Solomon Islands. Constitutional role The Commonwealth of Nations has over 50 member states, of which, sixteen are unofficially described as Commonwealth realms that recognise, individually, Elizabeth II as their monarch and therefore head of state; Solomon Islands is one of these. Each realm, including Solomon Islands, is a sovereign and independent state. Elizabeth II exercises her sovereignty only as Queen of Solomon Islands and on all matters relating to Solomon Islands, the monarch is advised solely by Solomon Islands ministers.https://www.royal.uk/solomon- islands The monarch of Solomon Islands is represented by the Governor-General of Solomon Islands, who is a citizen of Solomon Islands elected for a five- year term by the national parliament.http://www.commonwealthofnations.org/sectors- solomon_islands/government/ Formally, the monarch appoints the Governor- General on the advice of parliament.

As a protectorate the Solomon Islands protectorate had never been under the sovereignty of the British monarch. It had never formed part of Her Majesty’s dominions. Under the Solomon Islands Act 1978 the territory was formally annexed to form part of Her Majesty’s dominons and granted independence. The new sovereign democratic state was established with the Queen as head of state. The new constitution, providing for fully responsible status within the Commonwealth, took effect under The Solomon Islands Independence Order 1978, an order in council which had been requested by the Legislative Assembly. It was made under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 1890, and came into operation on 7 July 1978.The Solomon Islands Independence Order 1978, Statutory Instrument 1978 no. 783. Under the constitution the oath of allegiance is a declaration of allegiance to \\"Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Her Heirs and Successors\\".http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=198247 Duties The monarch's duties are performed by the Governor-General. The Governor-General represents the monarch on ceremonial occasions such as the opening of parliament, the presentation of honours and military parades. Under the constitution, he or she is given authority to act in some matters, for example in appointing and disciplining officers of the civil service, and in proroguing parliament. As in the other Commonwealth realms, the monarch's role is almost entirely symbolic and cultural. The powers that are constitutionally hers are exercised almost wholly upon the advice of the cabinet, made up of Ministers of the Crown. Members of the royal family occasionally visit Solomon Islands. The Queen has visited twice: in February 1974 (before independence) and in October 1982 (after the 1982 Commonwealth Games). Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied the Queen on both occasions, and also visited without the Queen, in 1959 and 1971. Princess Anne and Mark Phillips visited in 1974 and the Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge visited in 2012. Succession Succession to the throne in Solomon Islands is identical to the succession to the British throne. The heir apparent is Elizabeth II's eldest son, Charles. No Commonwealth realm can alter the succession without the agreement of the other realms. Under the Statute of Westminster, Solomon Islands has a common monarchy with other states, and Solomon Islands cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship by means of a constitutional amendment.

It was an ornithopod which lived in what is now Portugal and was a herbivore. It was found in the Lourinhã Formation in 1991, and described by Octávio Mateus and Miguel Telles Antunes in 2001. Etymology The type species, known from only partial remains, is Draconyx loureiroi. The generic name is derived from Latin draco, \\"dragon\\", and Ancient Greek ὄνυξ, onyx, \\"claw\\". The specific name is in honour of João de Loureiro, a Portuguese jesuit priest, a pioneer in Portuguese palaeontology. Material The holotype, ML 357, a partial skeleton lacking the skull, consists of two maxillary teeth, three caudal centra, one chevron, a distal epiphysis of right humerus, one manual phalanx, three manual unguals, a distal epiphysis of the right femur, the proximal and distal epiphyses of the tibia and fibula, an astragalus, a calcanaeum, three tarsals, four metatarsals and pedal phalanges. It was in 1991 found at Vale de Frades by Carlos Anunciação of the Museu da Lourinhã, in layers of the Bombarral Unit dating to the Tithonian. Histology shows that the holotype specimen was between 27 and 31 years old. A left femur (ML 434), found near Praia do Caniçal, has been referred to this taxon. Draconyx was a small bipedal herbivore. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 estimated the length at 3.5 metres, the weight at 150 kilograms.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 285 Systematics According to Mateus and Antunes (2001), Draconyx loureiroi is a member of the Iguanodontia, more specifically the Camptosauridae, based on the maxillary teeth, which have a strong vertical primary ridge on the distal side of the labial crown, and the femur, which is curved and has a prominent lesser trochanter.

This has prompted some people to remove the valves from these instruments and use them as cheap natural horns. This is considered by some to improve the playing qualities of the instrument, because the old piston valves were very inefficient. Some Sotones are based on compensating or other kinds of double systems, but the vast majority of them are single horns with crooks to common pitches like F and E-flat.

As such she is Antigua and Barbuda's sovereign and officially called Queen of Antigua and Barbuda. Most of the Queen's powers in Antigua and Barbuda are exercised by the Governor-General, presently Rodney Williams, though the Monarch does hold several powers that are hers alone. The Queen is the only member of the royal family with a constitutional role; she, her husband, Prince Philip, their son Prince Charles, and other members of the royal family undertake various public ceremonial functions within Antigua and Barbuda and abroad. Origins The current Antiguan and Barbudan monarchy can trace its ancestral lineage back to the Anglo-Saxon and Merovingian periods, and ultimately back to the kings of the Angles, the early Scottish kings, and the Frankish kingdom of Clovis I. Parts of the territories that today comprise Antigua and Barbuda were claimed under King Charles I in 1632. The country was proclaimed fully independent, via constitutional patriation, by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981. International and domestic aspects Sixteen states within the 52-member Commonwealth of Nations are known as Commonwealth realms and Antigua and Barbuda is one of these. Despite sharing the same person as their respective national monarch, each of the Commonwealth realms is sovereign and independent of the others.The English Court of Appeal ruled in 1982, while \\"there is only one person who is the Sovereign within the British Commonwealth... in matters of law and government the Queen of the United Kingdom, for example, is entirely independent and distinct from the Queen of Canada.\\" R v Foreign Secretary; Ex parte Indian Association, QB 892 at 928; as referenced in High Court of Australia: Sue v Hill [1999] HCA 30; 23 June 1999; S179/1998 and B49/1998 Development of shared monarchy The Balfour Declaration of 1926 provided the Dominions the right to be considered equal to Britain, rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of, in theory, a shared Crown that operates independently in each realm rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the Dominions were secondary. The Monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called \\"British\\" since (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, legal, and of convenience. The Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927 was the first indication of this shift in law, further elaborated in the Statute of Westminster, 1931. Under the Statute of Westminster, Antigua and Barbuda has a common monarchy with Britain and the other Commonwealth realms, and Antigua and Barbuda cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship by means of a constitutional amendment. This situation applies symmetrically in all the other realms, including the UK. On all matters of the Antiguan and Barbudian state, the Monarch is advised solely by Antiguan and Barbudian ministers. Effective with the patriation of Antigua and Barbuda's Constitution, no British or other realm government can advise the Monarch on any matters pertinent to Antigua and Barbuda. Title In Antigua and Barbuda, the Queen's official title is: * Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Antigua and Barbuda and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth. This style communicates Antigua and Barbuda's status as an independent monarchy, highlighting the Monarch's role specifically as Queen of Antigua and Barbuda, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the realms, by mentioning Antigua and Barbuda separately from the other Commonwealth realms. Typically, the Sovereign is styled \\"Queen of Antigua and Barbuda,\\" and is addressed as such when in Antigua and Barbuda, or performing duties on behalf of Antigua and Barbuda abroad. Finance Antiguans and Barbudians do not pay any money to the Queen, either for personal income or to support the royal residences outside of Antigua and Barbuda. Only when the Queen is in Antigua and Barbuda, or acting abroad as Queen of Antigua and Barbuda, does the Antiguan and Barbudian government support her in the performance of her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the Royal Family. Usually the Queen's Antiguan and Barbudian government pays only for the costs associated with the Governor-General in his or her exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonial occasions, etc. Succession Charles, Prince of Wales, is the heir apparent to the Antiguan and Barbudian Throne The heir apparent is Elizabeth II's eldest son, Charles. The Governor-General is expected to proclaim him King of Antigua and Barbuda upon his accession to the Throne upon the demise of the Crown. Succession to the throne is by male- preference primogeniture, and governed by the provisions of the Act of Settlement, as well as the English Bill of Rights. These documents, though originally passed by the Parliament of England, are now part of Antiguan and Barbudian constitutional law, under control of the Antiguan and Barbudian parliament only. As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a constitutional amendment. This legislation restricts the succession to the natural (i.e. non-adopted), legitimate descendants of Sophia, Electress of Hanover (1630–1714), a granddaughter of James I, and lays out the rules that the Monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic, nor married to one, and must be in communion with the Church of England upon ascending the throne. As Antigua and Barbuda's laws governing succession are currently identical to those of the United Kingdom (by the Statute of Westminster) see Succession to the British Throne for more information. Upon a \\"demise in the Crown\\" (the death of a Sovereign) his or her heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony. (Hence arises the phrase \\"The King is dead. Long live the King!\\") Nevertheless, it is customary for the accession of the Sovereign to be publicly proclaimed. After an appropriate period of mourning has passed, the Sovereign is also crowned in Westminster Abbey, normally by the Archbishop of Canterbury. A coronation is not necessary for a Sovereign to rule; for example, Edward VIII was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly King during his short reign. After an individual ascends the Throne, he or she continues to reign until death. Monarchs are not allowed to unilaterally abdicate; no Antiguan and Barbudian monarch has abdicated. Constitutional role Antigua and Barbuda's constitution is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or Antiguan and Barbudian in origin, which gives Antigua and Barbuda a similar parliamentary system of government as the other Commonwealth realms. All powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the Monarch, who is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda — appointed by the Monarch upon the advice of the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda; most of the Queen's domestic duties are performed by these vice-regal representative. The new constitution for Antigua and Barbuda was made by Order in Council (1981 No. 1106) under the West Indies Act 1967. It came into operation on 31 October 1981.The Antigua and Barbuda Constitution Order 1981 made at Buckingham Palace, 31 July 1981 Constitutional duties The role of the Queen and the Governor-General is both legal and practical; the Crown is regarded as a corporation, in which several parts share the authority of the whole, with the Queen as the person at the centre of the constitutional construct. The vast powers that belong to the Crown are collectively known as the Royal Prerogative, which includes many powers such as the ability to make treaties or send ambassadors, as well as certain duties such as to defend the realm and to maintain the Queen's peace. Parliamentary approval is not required for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative; moreover, the Consent of the Crown must be obtained before either House may even debate a bill affecting the Sovereign's prerogatives or interests. It is important to note that the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, and not to any of the ministers, though it may sometimes appear that way. Although the Royal Prerogative is extensive, it is not unlimited. For example, the Monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. The Crown is responsible for appointing a Prime Minister. In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the Monarch or Governor-General must appoint the individual most likely to maintain the support of the House of Representatives: usually, the leader of the party which has a majority in that House. If no party has a majority, two or more groups may form a coalition, whose agreed leader is then appointed Prime Minister. In a Parliament in which no party or coalition holds a majority, the Crown is required by convention to appoint the individual most likely to command the support of the House of Commons, usually, but not necessarily, the leader of the largest party. Situations can arise in which the Governor-General's judgement about the most suitable leader to be Prime Minister has to be brought into play. The Queen is informed by the Governor- General of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister and members of the Ministry. It is a duty of the Crown to also appoint and dismiss ministers, members of various executive agencies, other officials. The appointment of Senators and the Speaker of the Senate also falls under the Royal Prerogative. Effectively, however, the appointees are chosen by the Prime Minister, or, for less important offices, by other ministers. In addition, it is the Crown's prerogative to declare war, make peace, and direct the actions of the military, although the Prime Minister holds de facto decision-making power over the armed forces. The Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the Sovereign or Governor-General may negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements; no parliamentary approval is required. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the Antigua and Barbuda; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The Governor- General, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits Antiguan and Barbudian High Commissioners and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states. In addition, all Antiguan and Barbudian passports are issued in the Monarch's name. In Antigua and Barbuda major public inquiries are called Royal Commissions, and are created by the Cabinet on behalf of the Monarch through a Royal Warrant. The Sovereign is one of the three components of Parliament; the others are the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Governor-General is also responsible for summoning the House of Commons, though it remains the Monarch's prerogative to prorogue, and dissolve Parliament. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which either the Sovereign or the Governor-General reads the Speech from the Throne in the Senate Chamber, outlining the Government's legislative agenda. Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session. Dissolution, the timing of which is affected by a variety of factors, ends a parliamentary term (which lasts a maximum of five years), and is followed by general elections for all seats in the House of Commons. The Monarch or the Governor-General may theoretically refuse a dissolution. Because the Antiguan and Barbudian Monarchy is a constitutional one, the powers that are constitutionally the Monarch's are exercised almost wholly upon the advice of his or her Prime Minister and the Ministers of the Crown in Cabinet, who are, in turn, accountable to the democratically elected House of Commons, and through it, to the people. It has been said since the death of Queen Anne in 1714, the last monarch to head the British cabinet, that the monarch \\"reigns\\" but does not \\"rule\\". This means that the Monarch's role, and thereby the Governor-General's role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate. Legal role All laws in Antigua and Barbuda are enacted with the Sovereign's, or the Governor-General's signature. The granting of a signature to a bill is known as Royal Assent; it and proclamation are required for all acts of Parliament, usually granted or withheld by the Governor-General, with the Public Seal of Antigua and Barbuda. The Governor-General may reserve a bill for the Monarch's pleasure, that is to say, allow the Monarch to make a personal decision on the bill. The Monarch has the power to disallow a bill (within a time limit specified by the Constitution). The Sovereign is deemed the \\"fount of justice,\\" and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects. The Sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name. The common law holds that the Sovereign \\"can do no wrong\\"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences. Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the Monarch personally are not cognisable. In international cases, as a sovereign and under established principles of international law, the Queen of Antigua and Barbuda is not subject to suit in foreign courts without her express consent. The Sovereign, and by extension the Governor-General, also exercises the \\"prerogative of mercy,\\" and may pardon offences against the Crown. Pardons may be awarded before, during, or after a trial. In Antigua and Barbuda the legal personality of the State is referred to as \\"Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Antigua and Barbuda.\\" For example, if a lawsuit is filed against the government, the respondent is formally described as Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Antigua and Barbuda. The monarch as an individual takes no more role in such an affair than in any other business of government. The Oath of Allegiance is required by law to be sworn by new members of the Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force, police officers, and parliamentarians; it is an oath to the Monarch as Sovereign of Antigua and Barbuda, and to his/her heirs and successors according to law. The Oath of Allegiance is as follows: :I, ___, do swear (or solemnly affirm) that I will faithfully bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her Heirs and Successors, according to law. So help me God. (To be omitted in affirmation). History Elizabeth II, Queen of Antigua and Barbuda, and her husband, the royal consort the Duke of Edinburgh, included the Antigua and Barbuda in their Caribbean tour of 1966, and in the Silver Jubilee tour of October 1977. The Queen visited again in 1985.Buckingham Palace: Monarchy Today: Queen and Commonwealth: Other Caribbean realms The Earl of Wessex opened Antigua and Barbuda's new parliament building on the country's twenty fifth anniversary of independence, 30 October 2006, reading a message from his mother, the Queen.

Discovery In 1965 Philippe Taquet discovered the remains of an ornithopod in rock layers of the Elrhaz Formation, in the Tenere desert of Niger, it consists of a partial skeleton with a fragmentary skull belonging to single individual which was given the catalogue number GDF 1700, the remains sat undescribed until 1988 when paleontologist Souad Chabli coined the name \\"Gravisaurus tenerensis\\" in her unpublished dissertation on the animal,Chabli, S., 1988, Étude anatomique et systématique de Gravisaurus tenerensis n. g., n. sp. (Dinosaurien, Ornithischien) du gisement de Gadoufauoua (Aptien du Niger). Ph.D. dissertation, Université de Paris VII. UFR de Biologie et des Sciences de la nature 164 pp however since the name was never published it is invalid, the remains were later briefly described and formally given the name Lurdusaurus arenatus by Taquet and Dale Russell in 1999, a name with similar etymology to \\"Gravisaurus tenerensis\\". Description Based on the known specimen, Lurdusaurus arenatus had an unusually heavy build compared to other iguanodonts. Their forelimbs were proportionally short and powerfully constructed as were their hands which bore an enlarged thumb claw, their hindlimbs as well were massive and proportionally short, specially the lower leg, the foot was unusually constructed in that the foot bones (metatarsals) lacked solid contact with each other suggesting the presence of a fleshy pad that supported most of the weight. Their necks were relatively longer than in their relatives due to their neck vertebra being both more numerous and comparatively elongated. The type specimen would have been about tall at the hips and it was estimated to have approached in length while weighing based on the circumference of its limb bones, lower weight and length estimates have been estimated, however.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 288 Due to their unusual body plan, the describers Taquet and Russell suggested that they would have looked superficially like an ankylosaur. Paleobiology Original thumb spike of Lurdusaurus arenatus in Paris Lifestyle Paleontologist Tom Holtz has speculated that, based on its bodily proportions and spreading hands, Lurdusaurus arenatus may have led an aquatic or semiaquatic lifestyle, similar to a hippopotamus. Habitat The fossils of Lurdusaurus arenatus were found in the Elrhaz Formation, dating from the late Aptian to the early Albian of the Early Cretaceous period, approximately 112 million years ago. The stratigraphy of the formation and its aquatic fauna suggest that it was an inland fluvial environment, entirely freshwater in nature with a humid tropical climate. The named dinosaur fauna of the region apart from Lurdusaurus consisted of Ouranosaurus, the sauropod Nigersaurus, the spinosaurid Suchomimus, the carcharodontosaurid Eocarcharia and the abelisaurid Kryptops. The waters moreover were inhabited by the semionotid fish Pliodetes as well as the giant crocodile relative, Sarcosuchus.

It involves android robots from outer space planning to take over the Earth, starting with London. They work following the directions of an authority called Control. Robot Five, nicknamed Slim John (Simon Williams), is himself a rebel robot who befriends a human couple, Stevie and Richard. Slim John has extraordinary strength. The plots revolve around the other robots trying to eliminate him, and often include the fact that Slim John and the other robots have limited amounts of power available and need to recharge themselves regularly. Short grammar lessons are transmitted to all the robots at regular intervals via their hand-held communication devices (anticipating personal digital assistants by more than 30 years). These short lessons are presented not only to the robots (including Slim John), but in full screen to the viewers. The serial was an educational tool used for English language instruction. It was supported by books and records as an English teaching method. The series was broadcast for years all over the world, in Turkey, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Brazil, Yugoslavia and other countries. Hungary, Poland and Romania were the only Eastern Bloc countries to show the serial, with an enormous response, in the 1970s.

The modern parliament of Hungary, the National Assembly, is unicameral and meets in the lower house, while the old upper house is used as a conference and meeting room and for tourism. The shaping of the House of Parliament grew out of conscious choices of symbolism and carries important historical and political messages.

Early life He was born to Janakinath Bose (father) and Prabhabati Devi in Cuttack, Odisha on 6 September 1889. The family originally hailed from Kodalia (now Subhashgram), South 24 Parganas, West Bengal.Subhash Chandra Bose: A Biography, Chattopadhyaya, Gautam, National Council of Educational Research and Training, New Delhi, 1997, p. 1 His father was descended from the Boses of Mahinagar (South 24 Parganas) while his mother Prabhabati Devi was part of the famous Dutt family of Hatkhola in north Kolkata.An Indian Pilgrim: An Unfinished Autobiography And Collected Letters 1897-1921, Subhas Chandra Bose, Asia Publishing House, London, 1965, p. 1 She gave birth to fourteen children, six daughters and eight sons, among whom were leftist leader Sarat Chandra Bose, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and distinguished cardiologist Dr. Sunil Chandra Bose. Sarat had two elder sisters. They were Pramilabala Mitra and Saralabala Dey. He had an elder brother, Satish Chandra Bose. He had six younger brothers, namely: Suresh Chandra Bose, Sudhir Chandra Bose, Dr. Sunil Chandra Bose (1894-17 Nov 1953), Subhas Chandra Bose (23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945), Sailesh Chandra Bose and Santosh Chandra Bose. He had four younger sisters, they were Tarubala Roy, Malina Dutt, Protiva Mitra, and Kanaklata Mitra. Sarat Bose studied in Presidency College, Scottish Church College, then affiliated with the University of Calcutta, and then went to England in 1911 to become a barrister. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. He began a successful legal practice upon his return to India, but later abandoned it to join the Indian independence movement..winentrance.com/general_knowledge/arat-chandra- bose.html Political career In 1936, Bose became the President of the Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee, and served as a member of the All India Congress Committee from 1936 till 1947. Sarat Bose was arrested after the escape of Subhas the day before he was due to join as Cabinet Minister in the Fazlul Haq government. He was moved to jail in Mercara and then Coonoor where his health suffered. He was released in September 1945 after a 4 1/2 year prison sentence. From 1946 to 1947, Bose would lead the Congress delegation to the Central Legislative Assembly. He strongly supported the formation of the Indian National Army by Subhas Bose, and actively participated in the Quit India movement. Following his brother's reported death in 1945, Bose led efforts to provide relief and aid to the families of INA soldiers through the INA Defence and Relief Committee. In 1946, he was appointed Member of the Interim Government for Works, Mines and Powers – the position of a minister in a national executive council led by Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and presided over by the Viceroy of India. Bengal partition and later life However, Bose resigned from the AICC in disagreement over the Cabinet Mission Plan's call to partition Bengal between Hindu-majority and Muslim- majority regions. He attempted to construct a bid for a united but independent Bengal and North-East with the Bengali Muslim League leaders Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Abul Hashim. Muhammad Ali Jinnah (President of the Muslim League, who became Pakistan's founding father) supported it, though he later changed his decision. Mahatma Gandhi also supported it. The Indian National Congress and the Hindu members of Indian Legislative Council from Bengal opposed it. After India's independence, Bose led his brother's Forward Bloc and formed the Socialist Republican Party, advocating a socialist system for Bengal and India. He died on 20 February in 1950, in Calcutta when he was 60 years old. Family Sarat Bose married Bivabati Dey, the daughter of Akhoy Kumar Dey and Subala Dey, in 1909. The couple had eight children. Their children included Asoke Nath Bose, a Doctorate in Chemistry from Germany and eminent engineer; Amiya Nath Bose who participated in the Quit India Movement, became a Member of Parliament, and was also the Indian ambassador to Burma; Sisir Kumar Bose,Sisir Kumar Bose, Sarat Chandra Bose: Remembering My Father, Netaji Research Bureau, Kolkata, 2014. who became a pediatrician and Member of Legislative Assembly, and Subrata Bose, who was an electrical engineer and also a Member of Parliament. His youngest daughter, Prof. Chitra Ghosh, is a distinguished academician, a social scientist, and also a member of the Parliament.

Early career Henry Fyshe Gisborne was the son of Thomas Gisborne the Younger and Elizabeth Fysche Palmer, daughter of John Palmer. He was educated at Harrow, Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, which he left without obtaining a degree. He left England due to ill health and travelled to Australia, landing in Sydney in 1834. In 1837 Gisborne was dispatched by Governor Bourke as police magistrate to Wellington, in the recently colonised Australian hinterland beyond the Blue Mountains where he attempted to keep the peace among early settlers and the native Wiradjuri. In Victoria In 1839 Governor Gipps appointed Gisborne Commissioner of Crown Lands of the Port Phillip District. Gisborne's official activities included scouting the hitherto little explored areas of central Victoria. Gisborne led his detachment of Border Police troopers in a skirmish known as the 'Battle of Yering' (no recorded loss of life on either side) at which the Wurundjeri chief Jaga Jaga (also known as Jackie Jackie) was captured, only to be rescued following the diversionary tactics of his colleagues.Kath Gannaway, Important step for reconciliation Star News Group, January 24, 2007.

Gisborne's most notable contributions to the fledgeling city were moving the site of Melbourne's turf meetings to their current location by the Maribyrnong River at Flemington Racecourse, donating the first books to the Mechanics' Institute (now the Athenaeum Library) and in June 1840 drafting and delivering the first petition for the separation of the Port Phillip District to Governor Gipps.

History The M79 and XM148 grenade launchers were single-shot, and the repeating T148E1 grenade launcher was unreliable, so a request was made to China Lake engineers. Navy SEAL teams were pleased with the resultant pump-action grenade launcher, since the tubular magazine held three 40x46mm grenades, and so with one grenade in the chamber, four grenades could be fired rapidly before reloading. In fact, a skilled operator could fire four aimed shots before the first one landed. The grenade launcher was extremely light for its size, since a significant portion of it was made of aluminum.http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2449 Submitted for field trials in Vietnam, this weapon apparently performed quite well with HE-Frag ammunition.http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2449 The pump-action grenade launcher features leaf iron sights similar to the M79. The front sight is a fixed square notch. Depending on if the leaf is folded or not, the rear square notch is either fixed or adjustable from 75 to 400 m in 25 m increments.http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2449 The larger screw on the left side of the receiver was designed for a quadrant sight to be mounted. Sources differ as to how many weapons were produced. One claims that between 20 and 30 were made. However, according to another source, only 16 were made. The highest original receiver number found is 50, but it may never have been made into a functional weapon. SEAL historian Kevin Dockery has confirmed 22 completed guns being carried on Navy records. Only three originals currently remain under US Navy control, the rest have since been demilitarized. It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as the \\"EX-41\\" or as the \\"China Lake NATIC\\". The EX-41 was a design prototype created in the mid-1990s based upon the earlier China Lake Model pump 40mm. The EX-41 was only produced as a single prototype. It was a follow up design created a two decades after the China Lake Model was produced. The China Lake NATIC designation is also erroneous as the weapon was never known by that designation. Since it was made on an ad hoc basis for special operations forces, it was not formally adopted and has no official military designation. Thus the SEALs referred to the experimental weapon by referencing the facility which produced it, thus creating the name, the \\"China Lake grenade launcher\\".http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2449 All four remaining original China Lake Model grenade launchers are on display in museums. Serial number 4, is at the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida while serial number 13 is on display in the War Remnants Museum in HCMC, Vietnam. Serial number 2 is stored at the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington DC.http://imgur.com/c8kvl One additional launcher is on limited display in a military restricted US Navy facility at NSWC Crane. Improvements and contracts An effort to produce an improved version of the weapon began in 1992 when Samuel \\"Dutch\\" Hillenburg, a firearms writer specializing in military weapons, teamed up with master machinist Brian Fauci. In 2003, they achieved a breakthrough and were able to convince fellow writer and firearms enthusiast Captain Monty Mendenhall to finance their research effort. By 2004, they had a functional prototype and had formed Trident Enterprises Ltd. to continue their work on the project under government patent. Brian Fauci later sold his improved upon military demonstration CSG/Trident China Lake Grenade Launchers to private parties after the contract for a Marine Corps replacement Grenade Launcher was cancelled in October 2009 with the selection of the M32. Starting in 2004 Brian Fauci's Trident/CSG of New York created nine China Lake reproduction launcher receivers. These launchers were separate from the ten contracted Trident launchers connected to the Airtronic deal. The CSG/Trident China Lake launchers have additional manufacturing to increase reliability & improved cycling of action compared that of the original. CSG also replaced most flat headed screws to hex headed screws, the butt stock recoil pads are solid on the CSG launchers instead of ventilated for padding as on the original China Lake launchers, no sling studs or swivels were installed initially on the CSG launchers although they have the threading completed for the installation of the sling swivel. Manufacturing metals were upgraded with improved hardness treatments and metallurgy since the original China Lake development with both the Airtronic/Trident and CSG/Trident launchers. There are a total of nine privately owned China Lake grenade launchers accounted for inside the United States plus the four original China Lake grenade launchers from the NAWS which remain in museums only.  2007-2009 U.S. Defense Contract  In June 2007, China Lake launchers were in limited production by two different companies and were ready to market under contract the reproduction launchers to the U.S. military by way of defense contracts. At that time, the U.S. Military was approached with an offer from Airtronic USA (then the current government manufacturer of the M203 after Colt) to acquire a license for military production and sales. Both CSG and Airtronic/Trident launchers were considered for replacement of the M79 stand alone launcher in the Marine Corps. In July 2007, Airtronic USA announced that they were entering large scale production with an initial order for 500 units destined for US military forces. This announcement occurred simultaneously with a demonstration of the CSG/Trident China Lake launcher in an episode of the popular military technology program, \\"Weaponology\\". As of 2009, Airtronic USA will commence manufacturing the launcher in its original form and another variant with picatinny rails, pistol grip and retractable \\"M4 Carbine\\" type stock. From 2007-2009 contractor and manufacturer Airtronic USA invested over two million dollars with Trident for a contract to reproduce the China Lake Launcher's original design and a more modular design (Information Provided by Marriellen Kett President of Airtronic USA). These improvements include a M203 handguard, M4 style collapsible stock and barrel with a top rail for accessories, and extending the magazine tube to fit four grenades plus one in the chamber. Ten of the China Lake Mil-Spec Reproduction launchers were manufactured in 2009 but eventually the two companies involved (Airtronic and Trident) parted ways after legal action. During this the U.S.M.C adopted the Milkor M32 Grenade Launcher as a replacement, essentially ending any further development of the China Lake launcher. Price Of the original 1967-1969 NAWS manufactured China Lake Grenade Launchers, none are known to be under private ownership. The Trident/CSG China Lake Grenade Launchers from the 2009 defense contract are the last nine known legal launchers to be in private hands and are valued between $65,000 and $75,000 USD based on past auctions. All ten Airtronic/Trident launchers were destroyed and melted down. No other official manufactures are known with a government patented contract since 2009. The nine CSG/Trident patented contract China Lake launchers are transferable as a Destructive Device in the United States.

It was built on the chassis of the Hispano-Suiza HS.30, which was also used on the Schützenpanzer SPz 12-3, and armed with twin French SS.11 antitank guided missile launchers. Only one of the missile launchers is visible from the outside at any time, however, as the other is retracted into the hull to be reloaded when the first is ready to fire. Armament The twin mounted launchers for the SS.11 anti-tank guided weapons were the primary armament for the Raketenjagdpanzer 1. With ten missiles per vehicle, the crew had the theoretical ability to destroy ten enemy vehicles, although this was doubtful in practice. The weapon was wire-guided and the gunner continued to control the missile via a small periscope after launch. The SS.11 missile could penetrate 600 mm of rolled homogeneous armor.

The legislative power was vested in this parliament, consisting of two houses: an upper house titled the Főrendiház (, House of Magnates), and a lower house titled the Képviselőház (, House of Representatives). From 1902 the Országgyűlés met at the Hungarian Parliament Building on the Danube in Budapest. Early history An assembly of the Hungarian estates of the realm and royal free cities (szabad királyi város) had convened at Bratislava (Pozsony) since the late Middle Ages; however, it never achieved extended legislative rights in the centralised Habsburg Monarchy and the succeeding Austrian Empire. In the course of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 a national assembly was called at Pest that was dismissed by decree of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria in October; the next year an Hungarian assembly met at the Protestant Great Church of Debrecen, which declared the new Emperor Franz Joseph deposed and elected Lajos Kossuth regent-president. The revolution was finally suppressed by Austrian troops under General Julius Jacob von Haynau and the assembly dissolved. The Habsburgs again approached toward the Hungarian estates after the disastrous defeat at the 1859 Battle of Solferino and the loss of Lombardy. In 1860 Emperor Franz Joseph issued the October Diploma, which provided a national Reichsrat assembly formed by delegates deputed by the Landtage diets of the Austrian crown lands, followed by the February Patent of 1861, promising the implementation of a bicameral legislature. The Hungarian magnates however rejected to be governed from Vienna and insisted on an own parliamentary assembly with comprehensive autonomy in Hungarian affairs. The negotiations failed, predominantly due to the tough stance of Austrian Minister-President Anton von Schmerling. Finally in the course of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the emperor appointed Gyula Andrássy Hungarian minister-president and the re-established national assembly convened on 27 February. Főrendiház (House of Magnates) The House of Magnates was, like the current British House of Lords, composed of hereditaries, ecclesiastics, and, unlike the House of Lords, deputized representatives from autonomous regions (Similar to Resident Commissioners of United States territories). The House had no fixed membership size, as anyone who met the qualifications could sit in it. The official list: * Princes of the royal house who have attained their majority (16 in 1904) * Hereditary peers who paid at least 3000 florins a year land tax (237 in 1904) (at its 1896 exchange rate, £1 was worth 12 florins, so this comes to £250) * High dignitaries of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches (42 in 1904) * Representatives of the Protestant confessions (13 in 1904) * Life peers appointed by the Crown, not exceeding 50 in number, and life peers elected by the house itself (73 altogether in 1904) * Various state dignitaries and high judges (19 in 1904) * Three delegates of Croatia-Slavonia Képviselőház (House of Representatives) Assembly hall The House of Representatives consisted of members elected, under the Electoral Law of 1874, by a complicated franchise based upon property, taxation, profession or official position, and ancestral privileges. The House consisted of 453 members, of which 413 are deputies elected in Hungary and 43 delegates of Croatia-Slavonia sent by the parliament of that Kingdom. Their terms were for five years and were remunerated. The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition considered the franchise \\"probably the most illiberal in Europe\\". The working classes were wholly unrepresented in the parliament, only 6% of them, and 13% of the small trading class, possessing the franchise, which was only enjoyed by 6% of the entire population. The parliament was summoned annually by the king at Budapest. While official language was Hungarian, but the delegates of Croatia-Slavonia were allowed to use Croatian language in the proceedings. The Hungarian parliament had power to legislate on all matters concerning Hungary, but for Croatia-Slavonia only on matters which concern these provinces in common with Hungary. The executive power was vested in a cabinet responsible to it, consisting of ten ministers, including: the president of the council, the minister for Croatia-Slavonia, a minister ad latum, and the ministers of the interior, of national defence, of education and public worship, of finance, of agriculture, of industry and commerce, and of justice.

It is the official centre of the Balatonboglár wine region, and is often called the \\"town of grapes and wine.\\" Between 1979 and 1991 Balatonboglár formed a single settlement together with Balatonlelle under the name Boglárlelle. History The region has been populated for more than six thousand years. The area was first documented in 1211. The first bathing association was established in 1904, and Balatonboglár was declared a medicinal bath in 1912. Balatonboglár and Balatonlelle were unified as Boglárlelle from 1979 until October 1, 1991. The Xantus look-out tower, the symbol of the city, resides on top of a hill and is well lit at night. It is named for John Xantus de Vesey. Main sights Statue of Pál Teleki The city is host to a statue honoring a controversial figure in Hungarian history, Pál Teleki, who was twice prime minister of Hungary. Teleki was regarded by some as a flawed hero and he remained a controversial person long after his death. This was reflected in a public dispute covered in the Hungarian media during early 2004 over a statue of him, marking the 63rd anniversary of his death. The statue by Sculptor Tibor Rieger was originally to be installed opposite the President's official residence in Budapest. However, the Minister of Culture István Hiller, following pressure from the Wiesenthal Center, canceled these plans. On 5 April 2004, the statue was finally placed in the courtyard of the Catholic Church in Balatonboglár. Balatonboglar had during World War II been host to thousands of Polish refugees who opened in that town one of only two secondary schools for Poles in Europe during 1939-1944. They credited Teleki with opening Hungary's borders to them and named a street in Warsaw for him after the war ended.

Gary Byrd, a part-time palaeontologist, discovered some remains of this euornithopod (ribs and an ungual) during early 1994 at Flower Mound, Denton County, north-central Texas, which was a part of the Appalachian continent at the time. He informed professional palaeontologist Yuong-Nam Lee of the find, who arranged for the entire preserved fossil to be excavated. It was first reported upon in 1996 by Jason Head of the Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences, Southern Methodist University.J.J. Head, 1996, \\"A primitive hadrosaur (Dinosauria: Ornithischia) from the Cenomanian of Texas and its implications for hadrosaurian phylogenetic and biogeographic histories\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 16(3, supplement): 40A The type species Protohadros byrdi was described and named by Head in 1998. The genus name is derived from Greek πρῶτος, protos, \\"first\\", en ἁδρός, hadros, \\"thick\\", a reference to the fact that Head considered the species the oldest known hadrosaur. The specific name honours Byrd.Head J.J., 1998, \\"A new species of basal hadrosaurid (Dinosauria, Ornithopoda) from the Cenomanian of Texas\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 18(4): 718 - 738 (1998) The holotype, specimen SMU 74582, of Protohadros, was found in the Woodbine Formation, which dates to the middle Cenomanian. It consists of a partial skull, pieces of ribs, a hand ungual and a neural arch. In 1997 Lee named possible tracks of Protohadros as the ichnospecies Caririchnium protohadrosaurichnos.Yuong-Nam Lee, 1997, \\"Bird and dinosaur footprints in the Woodbine Formation (Cenomanian), Texas\\", Cretaceous Research (1997) 18: 849-864 Due to the paucity of the remains much of the reconstruction of this dinosaur is speculative. The skull is about seventy centimetres long. From this Head estimated the length of the type specimen of Protohadros at seven to eight metres. He pointed out that this specimen was that of a subadult and that fully-grown individuals could have been longer. Protohadros had a massive, very deep set of lower jaws, and the snout was strongly turned down at the front, which according to Head suggested a habit of grazing on low-growing plants, rather than browsing from bushes or overhanging branches. Its diet would then have consisted of the swamp plants which grew in the delta streams in its habitat, scooped up by the broad, down-turned mouth. In some respects Protohadros was intermediate in morphology to more derived hadrosaurids. Like these it did have pleurokinesis, a cranial joint system that produced the food-grinding action, but only partially in that the quadrate at the back of the skull was still relatively immobile. Protohadros' rear legs were probably longer than the front pair, and it could move on all fours or walk and run on its hind legs only. Protohadros was first described as the most basal member of the Hadrosauridae, hence its generic name. However, scientific opinion has since changed and it is now regarded as a non-hadrosaurid iguanodontian, a basal member of the Hadrosauroidea, though one closely related to the Hadrosauridae. The dinosaur's discovery conflicted with the idea that hadrosaurids evolved in Asia, but its reassessment as a less-derived iguanodontian has rendered this discrepancy less problematic.

Biography Born in Achern, in the German state of Baden, Weber graduated from the military school at Karlsruhe in 1843, and served as an infantry lieutenant in the Grand Duke's army. In 1849, during the Revolutions of 1848, he served with the revolutionaries under Franz Sigel. He emigrated to America, one of a large group of political refugees who came to be as known as the Forty-Eighters. He settled in New York City and worked as proprietor of the Konstanz Hotel in New York.Eicher p.558 Weber enlisted to fight in the Civil War as a colonel on May 16, 1861. He raised a German-American unit known as the \\"Turner Rifles,\\" a company that eventually became a part of the 20th New York Infantry.Antietam on the Web Weber was stationed at Fort Monroe in Virginia. He took part in the capture of Fort Hatteras. From September 1861 until May 1862, he commanded Camp Hamilton, near Fort Monroe, being commissioned brigadier general of volunteers on April 28, 1862. He was at Newport News during the fight between the Monitor and Virginia in anticipation of a Confederate attack by land. He took part in the capture of Norfolk, Virginia in May, and then commanded at Suffolk until September, when he was ordered to the Army of the Potomac where he commanded the Third Brigade, Third Division, Second Army Corps in the Army of the Potomac. Weber's brigade was the first to attack the Sunken Road during the Battle of Antietam. His right arm was grievously wounded in the ill-fated attack on the Confederate positions. The injury forced Weber off to a series of desk assignments for the duration of the conflict. He served on administrative duty in Washington, D.C., in 1863. He served under Gen. David Hunter and Gen. Franz Sigel in the Shenandoah Valley in 1864. He was the garrison commander of Harpers Ferry and repelled Jubal A. Early's July 4–7 raid. Weber resigned his commission on May 13, 1865. After the war, he was assessor of internal revenue in New York in 1870-72, and then collector until April 1883, when he resigned. Weber served as U.S. counsel in Nantes, France. He died at his home in Brooklyn on June 15, 1901. See also *List of American Civil War generals (Union) *German Americans in the Civil War Notes References * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher.

The name derives from its use in earlier times as a source of millstones for use principally in watermills. Geologists refer to the whole suite of rocks that encompass the individual limestone beds and the intervening mudstones as the Millstone Grit Group. The term Millstone Grit Series was formerly used to refer to the rocks now included within the Millstone Grit Group together with the underlying Edale Shale Group. The term gritstone describes any sandstone composed of coarse angular grains, and specifically refers to such sandstones within the Pennines and neighbouring areas of Northern England. Geographical occurrence Rocks assigned to the Millstone Grit Group occur over a wide area of Northern England, where they are a hugely important landscape-forming element of the rock succession. They also occur in parts of northeast Wales and northwest Ireland. The group comprises a succession of sandstones, mudstones and siltstones, the specifics of the sequence varying from one area to another. They give rise both to a number of escarpments, known locally as edges, and a series of high plateaux throughout the region, many of which are of considerable cultural significance. Pennines Stanage Edge in the eastern Peak district They are the major landscape-forming rocks of the northern part of the Peak District (the Dark Peak) and of its eastern and western flanks in the counties of Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire. The great expanses of moorland around Bleaklow and Black Hill and fringed with broken outcrops of gritstone are characteristic of the area. The ‘eastern edges of the Peak District’ comprise a broadly north-south arranged series of west-facing cliffs from Bamford Edge in the north through Stanage Edge, Burbage Edge, Froggatt Edge, Curbar Edge, Baslow Edge, Gardom's Edge, Birchen Edge, Dobb/Chatsworth Edge, Harland Edge and Fallinge Edge in the south. To the east of these edges is a broad band of relatively flat moorland known as the Eastern Moors. Towards the western margins of the Peak District are a rather more broken series of edges, facing in a variety of directions, from those surrounding the high plateaux of Kinder Scout and Combs Moss to the imposing crags of the Roaches, Hen Cloud and Ramshaw Rocks in the south. A millstone shaped from Millstone Grit quarried in the area has been adopted as the emblem of the Peak District National Park. As an image, the millstone is widely visible on literature but use is made of the objects themselves at many of the entrances to the National Park. These rocks extend northwards through the South Pennines of Lancashire and West Yorkshire and westwards into the Forest of Rossendale and West Pennines and the Forest of Bowland, also in Lancashire. At the Yorkshire Dales they cover the south-east edge, but north of the Craven Faults, due to weathering, they form only cappings to separate hills. Northeast Wales A small area of Millstone Grit Group rocks stretches through Flintshire and Wrexham into the northwest corner of Shropshire near Oswestry. South Wales The term 'Millstone Grit' was also adopted in South Wales where rocks of similar age and lithology are found though the Millstone Grit Series of this region has recently been formally renamed by the British Geological Survey as the Marros Group. The thickest bed of sandstone within it was known as the Basal Grit and this has now been renamed as the Twrch Sandstone. The Farewell Rock was formerly considered to be the uppermost unit of the Millstone Grit series of South Wales though it is now included within the overlying South Wales Coal Measures. Main article: Marros Group Ireland The term has also been adopted at Slieve Anierin in northwest Ireland, describing the series of shales, grits, and coal seams, occurring from the base of the Namurian upwards.  Origins  The Millstone Grit dates to the Namurian Stage of the Carboniferous Period. At this time a series of isolated uplands existed across the British Isles region. One particular east-west aligned landmass stretched from Wales through the English Midlands and East Anglia to the continent and is now known as the Wales-Brabant High, though was formerly referred to as St George's Land. Other uplands the erosion of which would provide the source material for the Millstone Grit lay to the north and northeast of the region. The Pennine Basin received input of sand and mud largely from southerly directed rivers from these northern landmasses. Rivers running north off the Wales-Brabant High deposited material in the southern parts of the Pennine basin from northeast Wales to the Peak District. Southerly flowing rivers from this same landmass were responsible for the Millstone Grit/Marros Group succession in South Wales. During much of the Carboniferous Period, world sea-levels were fluctuating in response to the growth and decline of a series of major ice- caps over the continents then clustered around the South Pole. Britain lay in the equatorial region. At times of high sea-level, silt and mud accumulated within the Pennine basin whilst at times of low sea-level, major deltas prograded across the region, their legacy being the thick sandstone beds of the Millstone Grit Group.Aitkenhead, N. et al 2002 British Regional Geology: the Pennines and adjacent areas (4th Edn) (BGS, Nottingham) Stratigraphy The Millstone Grit Group comprises over thirty individually named sandstones, some of regional extent, others more local in their occurrence. The intervening mudstones and siltstones are not generally named though important marine bands within them are named. The oldest, and hence lowermost in the succession is the thick Pendle Grit of central Lancashire. It is succeeded by the sandstone known variously as the Brennand Grit, Warley Wise Grit and Grassington Grit. These are all of Pendleian (E1) age – the lowermost sub- stage of the Namurian. The Lower Follifoot Grit, Silver Hills Sandstone, Nottage Crag Grit, Marchup Grit, Red Scar Grit, Ward’s Stone Sandstone, Cocklett Scar Sandstones and Dure Clough Sandstones are all assigned to the following Arnsbergian sub-stage. The Kinderscoutian includes the Kinder Grit, Longnor Sandstones, Shale Grit, Todmorden Grit, Parsonage Sandstone, Heysham Harbour Sandstone, Eldroth Grit and Ellel Crag Sandstone. The next sub-stage of the Namurian succession is the Marsdenian and it is to this that the Chatsworth Grit, Huddersfield White Rock, Holcombe Brook Grit, Greta Grits, Roaches Grit, Ashover Grit, Gorpley Grit, Pule Hill Grit, Fletcher Bank Grit, Brooksbottom Grit, Five Clouds Sandstones and Sheen Sandstones are assigned. The closing sub-stage of the Namurian, the Yeadonian includes the Lower Haslingden Flags and the last sandstone in the entire Millstone Grit succession known as the Rough Rock. It is a widespread unit which attains a thickness of around 45m though is more generally 15m thick.Various of BGS 1:50,000 scale geological map sheets Economic importance Various of the sandstone beds of the Millstone Grit have been quarried for building stone, paving flags and roofing material. Its use in the construction of dry stone walls across the areas where it outcrops is considerable. In neighbouring limestone areas, gritstone has often been preferred in the past for use as gateposts and lintels.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/foundation-web/BlackRock.html The very name of the rock derives from its widespread use within cornmills where it proved suitable for grinding stones. It also found agricultural use as drinking troughs for animals. The majority of the quarrying for such use took place along the eastern edges of the Peak District. Millstone Edge was a significant source whilst abandoned millstones can be seen below the edges at Stanage, Froggatt and Baslow. Some of the sandstones serve as aquifers into which numerous wells and boreholes have been sunk to provide local water supplies.http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/3551/1/CR05015N.pdf Crushed gritstone is also used as aggregate in path and road construction. Rock climbing The gritstone edges of West Yorkshire and the Peak District provide one of the classic areas in Britain for rock climbing. Public access to these edges for climbing developed at much the same time as access for walkers to the moors of the Pennines was established during the first half of the twentieth century. Their proximity to large centres of population resulted in their rapid development as climbing venues.

It lived in Mongolia and China during the Late Cretaceous period. Discovery and species Mounted fossil. In 1959 and 1960 a Soviet-Chinese expedition uncovered the remains of a euornithopod in Inner-Mongolia near Maortu. The type species is Probactrosaurus gobiensis, described and named by A. K. Rozhdestvensky in 1967. The generic name refers to Rozhdestvensky's hypothesis that Probactrosaurus would be the direct ancestor of Bactrosaurus, a notion today discarded. The specific name refers to the Gobi desert. The holotype specimen, PIN 2232/1, a partial skeleton with skull, was found in layers of the Dashuigou Formation. Another partial skeleton was found, PIN 2232-10, along with numerous other fragments. In 1966 Rozhdestvensky also named a second species, Probactrosaurus alashanicus, based on fragmentary material. Its specific name refers to the Alxa League. In 2002 David Bruce Norman published a revision of the genus, in which he reported the holotype specimen of P. alshanicus, the back of a skull, had been lost after being dispatched from Moscow to Beijing. He concluded that the species was a synonym of P. gobiensis. In 1997 Lü Junchang named a third species, Probactrosaurus mazongshanensis, based on holotype IVPP V.11333 found in 1992. The specific name refers to the Mazong Shan region. Today, this form is seen as more closely related to Equijubus and Altirhinus rather than to P. gobiensis and is therefore commonly referred to as \\"Probactrosaurus\\" mazongshanensis. It was moved to the new genus Gongpoquansaurus in 2014. Description Mounted skeletons Probactrosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the length at 5.5 metres (18 feet), the weight at one tonne.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 292 It was lightly built, with relatively long and slender arms and hands and only a small thumb spike. It had a narrow snout, an elongated lower jaw and tooth batteries, each consisting of a superimposed double row of flattened cheek teeth; a third row of replacement teeth was incipient. Probably predominantly quadrupedal, it shared some common features with the later duck-billed dinosaurs. Classification Probactrosaurus was originally assigned by Rozhdestvenky to the Iguanodontidae. Today it is seen as a basal member of the Hadrosauroidea, relatively closely related to the Hadrosauromorpha.

They are quite small, usually around 15 cm, up to 26 cm. These fish are apex predators and have enormous jaws filled with fang-like teeth. They are also able to hinge the neurocranium and upper-jaw system, which leads to the opening of the jaw to more than 100 degrees. This ability allows them to consume extremely large prey, often 50% greater than their standard length.  Features  It is one of the many species of deep-sea fish that can produce their own light through a chemical process known as bioluminescence. A special organ known as photophore helps produce this light. The deep-sea dragonfishes have large head, and mouth equipped with many sharp fang-like teeth. It has a long stringlike structure known as barbel, with a light producing photophore at the tip, attached to the its chin. It also has photophores attached along the sides of its body. They produce blue-green light, the wavelengths of which can travel the farthest in the ocean. The deep-sea dragonfish waves its barbel back and forth and produces flashing lights on and off to attract its preys and potential mates. Many of their preys also produce light themselves, which is why they have evolved to have black stomach walls to keep the lights concealed while digesting their meal, to stay hidden from their predators.

In contrast to Rh disease, about half of the cases of ABO HDN occur in a firstborn baby and ABO HDN does not become more severe after further pregnancies. The ABO blood group system is the best known surface antigen system, expressed on a wide variety of human cells. For Caucasian populations about one fifth of all pregnancies have ABO incompatibility between the fetus and the mother, but only a very small minority develop symptomatic ABO HDN.http://www.obgyn.net/english/pubs/features/presentations/panda13/ABO- Rh.ppt The latter typically only occurs in mothers of blood group O, because they can produce enough IgG antibodies to cause hemolysis. Although very uncommon, cases of ABO HDN have been reported in infants born to mothers with blood groups A and B. Presentation Complications *High at birth or rapidly rising bilirubin *Prolonged hyperbilirubinemia *Bilirubin Induced Neurological Dysfunction *Cerebral Palsy *Kernicterus *Neutropenia *Thrombocytopenia *Hemolytic Anemia - MUST NOT be treated with iron *Late onset anemia - Must NOT be treated with iron. Can persist up to 12 weeks after birth. Causes ;Environmental exposure: Anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM and do not pass through the placenta, but some mothers \\"naturally\\" have IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies, which can pass through the placenta. Exposure to A-antigens and B-antigens, which are both widespread in nature, usually leads to the production of IgM anti-A and IgM anti-B antibodies but occasionally IgG antibodies are produced. ;Fetal-maternal transfusion: Some mothers may be sensitized by fetal-maternal transfusion of ABO incompatible red blood and produce immune IgG antibodies against the antigen they do not have and their baby does. For example, when a mother of genotype OO (blood group O) carries a fetus of genotype AO (blood group A) she may produce IgG anti-A antibodies. The father will either have blood group A, with genotype AA or AO or, more rarely, have blood group AB, with genotype AB.P ;Blood transfusion: It would be very rare for ABO sensitization to be due to therapeutic blood transfusion as a great deal of effort and checking is done to ensure that blood is ABO compatible between the recipient and the donor. Risk factors In about a third of all ABO incompatible pregnancies maternal IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies pass through the placenta to the fetal circulation leading to a weakly positive direct Coombs test for the neonate's blood. However, ABO HDN is generally mild and short-lived and only occasionally severe because: * IgG anti-A (or IgG anti-B) antibodies that enter the fetal circulation from the mother find A (or B) antigens on many different fetal cell types, leaving fewer antibodies available for binding onto fetal red blood cells. * Fetal RBC surface A and B antigens are not fully developed during gestation and so there are a smaller number of antigenic sites on fetal RBCs. Diagnosis Routine antenatal antibody screening blood tests (indirect Coombs test) do not screen for ABO HDN. If IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies are found in the pregnant woman's blood, they are not reported with the test results, because they do not correlate well with ABO HDN. Diagnosis is usually made by investigation of a newborn baby who has developed jaundice during the first week of life. Testing *Coombs - after birth baby will have a direct coombs test run to confirm antibodies attached to the infant's red blood cells. This test is run from cord blood. In some cases, the direct coombs will be negative but severe, even fatal HDN can occur. An indirect coombs needs to be run in cases of anti-C, anti-c, and anti-M. Anti-M also recommends antigen testing to rule out the presence of HDN. *Hgb - the infant's hemoglobin should be tested from cord blood. *Reticulocyte count - Reticulocytes are elevated when the infant is producing more blood to combat anemia. A rise in the retic count can mean that an infant may not need additional transfusions.https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/pdf/manuals/42_Hemol.pdf Low retic is observed in infants treated with IUT and in those with HDN from anti- Kell *Neutrophils - as Neutropenia is one of the complications of HDN, the neutrophil count should be checked. *Thrombocytes - as thrombocytopenia is one of the complications of HDN, the thrombocyte count should be checked. *Bilirubin should be tested from cord blood. *Ferritin - because most infants affected by HDN have iron overload, a ferritin must be run before giving the infant any additional iron. *Newborn Screening Tests - Transfusion with donor blood during pregnancy or shortly after birth can affect the results of the Newborn Screening Tests. It is recommended to wait and retest 10–12 months after last transfusion. In some cases, DNA testing from saliva can be used to rule out certain conditions. Treatment The antibodies in ABO HDN cause anemia due to destruction of fetal red blood cells and jaundice due to the rise in blood levels of bilirubin a by-product of hemoglobin break down. If the anemia is severe, it can be treated with a blood transfusion, however this is rarely needed. On the other hand, neonates have underdeveloped livers that are unable to process large amounts of bilirubin and a poorly developed blood- brain barrier that is unable to block bilirubin from entering the brain. This can result in kernicterus if left unchecked. If the bilirubin level is sufficiently high as to cause worry, it can be lowered via phototherapy in the first instance or an exchange transfusion if severely elevated. *Phototherapy - Phototherapy is used for cord bilirubin of 3 or higher. Some doctors use it at lower levels while awaiting lab results. *IVIG - Intravenous Immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) has been used to successfully treat many cases of HDN. It has been used not only on anti-D, but on anti-E as well. IVIG can be used to reduce the need for exchange transfusion and to shorten the length of phototherapy. The AAP recommends \\"In isoimmune hemolytic disease, administration of intravenous γ-globulin (0.5-1 g/kg over 2 hours) is recommended if the TSB is rising despite intensive phototherapy or the TSB level is within 2 to 3 mg/dL (34-51 μmol/L) of the exchange level . If necessary, this dose can be repeated in 12 hours (evidence quality B: benefits exceed harms). Intravenous γ-globulin has been shown to reduce the need for exchange transfusions in Rh and ABO hemolytic disease.\\" *Exchange transfusion - Exchange transfusion is used when bilirubin reaches either the high or medium risk lines on the normogram provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (Figure 4). Cord bilirubin >4 is also indicative of the need for exchange transfusion.

History Sculpture of the cat The name is connected to an episode which occurred during the 1509 siege by the German King Maximilian I during the War of the League of Cambrai. According to legend, a cat was flayed alive to frighten the enemy with its screams. A sculpture of a cat jutting out of a niche was placed on the outer part of the tower facing Codalunga Street in order to commemorate this event, as well as symbolize the freedom of the people of Padua. The garden is so called because it was planned around the area where a monumental suspended tank with a circular shaped base was built. It is the first water tank to be built in Padua, a prestigious work of engineering dating back to the 1920s. It can hold 200 cubic metres (44,000 gallons) of water and was considered not only the best aqueduct in Italy but also one of the best water tanks in Europe. It is also remarkable as regards the construction materials since it is one of the earliest examples of the use of concrete in Padua. The decision to build the water tank and Codalunga water power plant just on this spot was due to the following events: #On 11 November an Austrian bomb exploded killing 96 inhabitants who had hidden inside the gunners which were considered safe shelters. #On 29 October a bomb, dropped from a plane in 1918 but unexploded until then, went off and destroyed the electric power plant causing serious water supply problems to the city. Description of the garden The space between the water reservoir and the wall was used for a public garden, inaugurated in 1925 and named della Rotonda. To enter the garden one cross a stepped path starting from Vicolo Mazzini and continuing parallel to Viale della Rotonda. The path is characterized by five balconies with a circular fountain in the centre and each balcony is framed by a simple ring of grass. The presence of many fountains is due to the presence of the water reservoir. In every fountain there are many water-lilies which fill the visitors with a sense of pleasure and serenity. Every terrace is separated from the next by gardens and gravel paths shaped like a circular geometric garden with an axis perpendicular to the water reservoir. The style of the Rotonda Garden is a mixture of Liberty and Classicism but it also presents features of the 20th century. The architectural style recalls the late baroque, but it is also rich in classical references, for example the flower urns and the tower mausoleum are carried out with a secessionist taste, while the shape of the flower beds, (round elliptic and drop-like), are typically liberty. In the flower beds are low bushes that are reminiscent of palms and agaves. At first the garden was apparently meant to hold few shrubby plants to be exposed to the light so as to put the main elements in contact with the water of the garden. At present the garden is being neglected and the trees that live here have no intrinsic value. These trees represent a serious problem for the masonry banks because their roots push on them. The main entrance is characterized by an imposing wrought-iron railing in liberty style. The garden has and overturned- L-shape which proceeds long and narrow in the balcony and terraces and widens at the end of these, where the water reservoir is situated. On it there are geometric elements in the lower part, floral decorations in the central park and Padua coat of arms in the upper part. At the bottom of the garden there is the stately water reservoir; its main fountain, which has a temple form, is close to a strong terraced wall structure. Inside there are some circular pilasters connected to each other by means of perimeterl and radial concrete arches, disposed on two overlapping floors because they have to support the suspended water reservoir properly. The story of the aqueduct started on 26 August 1875, when the Mayor said > “water is so vital to man and society, like air and light, that an abundance > of water distribution and a regular distribution to the whole city, deserve > to be fully kept alive in the citizens’ memories”. Following study, water from the Brenta and Bacchiglione rivers was excluded owing to their torpidity and bacterial counts, instead water of Dueville source was chosen. On 17 February 1886, the Padua town hall granted the management of the new aqueduct to Società Veneta per Imprese and Costruzioni Pubbliche. On 13 1888 in Unità d’ Italia Square, the much expected event took place: in front of an exulting crowd of Paduans the first pure water flow was raised. The water transport from Dueville was carried out by means of an underground supply long made of concrete and bricks, thoroughly plastered in order to ensure the complete isolation from external agents; this supply is still working. The reservoir, however, did not slacken the use of wells by Paduans, who avoided the costly aqueduct water. This bankrupted the Società Veneta administration. Accordingly, the commune, in 1892, decided to manage the service on its own through a special town hall authority. This office ceased its activity in 1904 when the town hall administration decided to combine the water and the gas service. Two Municipal Companies were set up and these merged into one in 1984, when the AMAG or Azienda Municipalizzata Acqua- Gas of Padua was established. The reservoir The \\"Rotonda\\" reservoir Construction of the \\"Rotonda\\" building, located at the corner of Via Citolo da Perugina, was begun on 21 September 1923. It was planned for dual functions: first as an elevated water tank and second, as to house in its base a chapel commemorating certain refugees killed in the recent world war. Its round shape resembles the Ancient Roman Tomb of Caecilia Metella in Rome. The aqueduct monumental reservoir is high; at the base, a small chapel was in memory of refugees from Padua, looking for shelter in the nearby courtyard of the Burlini family's house, and who died during an Austrian aerial bombardment during the war. Around the base is an inscription recalling the event: > “ SANGUINEM OLIM ATROCITER EFFUSUM AQUA PIE DEFLUENS LAVET MOLES IN CAELUM > PROFERAT PERPETUO”. On the reservoir, there is also the tombstone of Mr Andrea Moschetti, with the following inscription: > “Il martirio di 93 innocenti (....) salga a Dio olocausto perenne di futura > grandezza alla patria di un nuovo patto d’amore tra i popoli”, it can be > translated as: “May the torture of 93 innocent persons reach God as eternal > holocaust and a new pact of love among the peoples.” The reservoir aimed mainly to increase the daytime water availability by collecting it during the night. While its external shape recalls an ancient Roman mausoleum, the inside was technically innovating for its days. The essential lines that show the main structures, are so modern that it seems as if they are drawing the route of the water while falling down to the ground floor and into the earth. The aqueduct According to the increasing need of water during the time period up to Second World War, water had been taken from the water-layer of the town of Dueville. After the war, this system was not efficient enough anymore, and the lack of water became a serious problem. Consequently, studies and projects to sort out this matter became more intensive, and from the year 1955 the Town Hall Council of Padua decreed to devise the construction of the “New Aqueduct”. The most important action was building a second water-supplier called the “900 metres Conveyance”; whose construction was ended in 1961. In the meantime, in order to cope with water emergency situations an auxiliary aqueduct was also built; it consisted in a system for purifying the superficial water of the river Brentella, which partially overcame the shortage of water complained by the citizens. Afterwards relevant actions were taken in order to improve the efficiency and the functionality of the whole water system in Padua. Among the many actions taken, we can mention the following most important ones: *the drill of new wells in the area of Vicenza; *the duplication of some parts of the water conveyors bringing the water in the 900 mm (3') Conveyance; *the discovery of underground water layers in the area of Brentelle di Sopra (near Padua), the realization of pertinent works and a new drinkable water transportation system, thanks to the new aqueduct of the town of Anconeta (Vicenza); *the contemporary realization of a new huge reservoir, the new central aqueducts in the area of Brentelle, Montà and Stanga; *the reinforcement of the main water conveyors; *the substitution of the old steel distribution pipes with some new ones made in the same material but covered with fibro-concrete, in order to avoid the corrosion caused by electro-chemical agents. *the automation of the receiving, accumulation, elevation and distribution systems. Padua aqueduct contributed to solve the problems related to water supply of some smaller distribution authorities. The following are the most significant data concerning the aqueduct management: *water supply ... 45,000,000m3/per year (9,900 million gallons), *maximum output volume ... 148,000m3/per year (32.5 million gallons), *number users served ...92,000, *length of pipes ... , *number of employees ... 245. Water quality The water arrives to the receiving system after undergoing a long natural conditioning process in the deeper layers. The most varied rock fragments melt and shed their salts into the water, mineralising it. Therefore, Padua waters are classified as “medium- mineral” waters. The AMAG company has been dealing with the disinfection treatment of the waters introduced into the pipes since its start. Despite concerns in the 21st century about water quality; however the water is tested and drinkable according to legal standards, so much so that the administration is currently planning to build some cleaning up systems to keep the water within optimum quality standards.

Considered one of the pioneers of disco, Euro disco, and Indian pop, he has sold millions of records worldwide, and has received an Ivor Novello award for his work. He has been ranked at number 34 on NME 's \\"The 50 Greatest Producers Ever\\" list. Biddu was born in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. He began his music career in the 1960s, singing as part of a music band in India before moving to England where he would start his career as a producer. He eventually found some success producing a hit song for Japanese band The Tigers in 1969, scoring the soundtrack for 1972 British film Embassy, and producing several early disco songs that would find a niche audience in British northern soul clubs during the early 1970s. His international breakthrough came in 1974 with \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" performed by Carl Douglas; the song became one of the best-selling singles of all time with eleven million records sold, helped popularise disco music, was the first worldwide disco hit from Britain and Europe, and established Biddu as one of the most prolific dance music producers from outside the United States at the time. He soon began producing his own instrumental albums under the name Biddu Orchestra, which started an orchestral disco trend in Britain and Europe with 1975 hits \\"Summer of '42\\" and \\"Blue Eyed Soul\\"; his solo albums eventually sold 40 million copies worldwide. He also launched the careers of other British disco stars such as Tina Charles, helping her sell 36 million records within a few years, and Jimmy James; scored soundtracks for several British films such as The Stud (1978); and produced a hit song for the French singer Claude François. Biddu also experimented with electronic disco and Hi-NRG music from the mid-1970s, and influenced British new wave bands such as The Buggles, founded by two of his former session musicians Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes. Following the decline of disco in the Western world, he later found success in Asia during the 1980s, where he launched the careers of the late Pakistani pop singer Nazia Hassan and her brother Zohaib; he produced their debut album Disco Deewane, which charted in fourteen countries and became the best-selling Asian pop album up until that time, and helped the duo eventually sell 60 million records worldwide. During that decade, he also produced several hit Bollywood soundtracks for films such as Qurbani (1980) as well as several hit songs for Japanese pop idol Akina Nakamori and Chinese pop singer Samantha Lam (林志美). In the 1990s, he popularised Indian pop with the hit album Made in India (1995), which became the best-selling pop album in India and launched the career of Alisha Chinai, after which he would launch the careers of several more Indian pop acts such as Shaan and his sister Sagarika as well as Sonu Nigam. In the 2000s, Biddu has been active in the Western and Indian music scenes producing albums which are more spiritual and Eastern-oriented. He rearranged a classical hit for Luke Kenny's film, Rise of the Zombie. Early career (1960s) Biddu's family originally hailed from Kodagu in the Karnataka state of India, but he was born and grew up in the city of Bangalore, where he attended the Bishop Cotton Boys' School. He carries the clan name of Chendrimada. In the 1960s, as a youth, he developed a liking for the then new pop and rock music, as he said in a media interview, listening to pop hits played on the shortwave radio band of Radio Ceylon of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), which was then popular throughout Asia. He learnt to play the guitar and in his late teens and early twenties he frequented the clubs and bars of Bangalore, and soon started a music band called 'Trojans' with a few friends, including Ken Gnanakan, who later went on to start an NGO called \\"ACTS\\". The band was India's first English-speaking band, and found success playing cover versions of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Trini Lopez and hits of other Western stars of the day, in the clubs of Bangalore and also other Indian cities, such as Calcutta and Bombay. The band, however, split since Ken Gnanakan wanted to pursue higher studies, leaving Biddu alone as the sole member of the band. He played under the name 'Lone Trojan' and was popular as an act at a night club called \\"Venice\\" in Bombay. Biddu held an interest for bigger things in popular music, and in 1967 left for England. He traveled through the Middle East, earning money by singing catchy numbers and playing the guitar. Biddu arrived in England at the age of 23, a few months after leaving India. About his arrival in England, he said in an interview to the BBC: \\"I didn't really know too much about England or anything – I'd just come here on the chance of meeting the Beatles and doing some music. Everything that I did had this danceable flavour\\". Within a few months of his arrival, he had met The Beatles, but expressed disappointment that \\"Lennon was dressed so badly.\\" In England, he supported himself doing odd jobs and also working as a chef in the American Embassy. His attempts at becoming a singer in England were unsuccessful and, according to Biddu, \\"as an Indian in those days they were happier to hire me as an accountant than as a singer\\". He eventually gave up on his ambition to become a singer and instead decided to produce his own records rather than working for a record company. He saved a few pounds before he decided to rent studio time and record several singles, none of which received any airplay from UK radio stations. Biddu's first major success was in 1969, when he produced the song \\"Smile for Me\\", performed by The Tigers, who were Japan's most famous band at the time, and written by the Barry and Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees. Since the band did not speak English, Biddu had to show them how to sing the English lyrics phonetically. Following its release that year, the song topped the chart in Japan. His success abroad in Japan would later pave the way for his later success back in Britain. Euro disco scene (1970s) During the early 1970s, Biddu produced several early disco songs that, despite receiving no airplay on radio, began gaining some underground success in UK northern soul clubs, in places like Wigan and Blackpool, which were more receptive to Biddu's early disco sounds due to northern soul being a forerunner to disco. The Biddu sound incorporated \\"solid playing by a hard rhythm section and fast swirling Northern soul–style melodies\\" and resembled the disco sound that had appeared independently in New York at around the same time. In 1971, he wrote the title track for the Jack Wild album Everything's Coming Up Roses, which was released as a single backed with \\"Bring Yourself Back to Me\\", written by Don Gould and Lynsey De Paul. The single earned positive reviews, with Billboard awarding it Special Merit Spotlight statusBillboard, 3 July 1971 and it reached number 107 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Chart.Billboard, 28 August 1971 In 1972, Biddu scored music for the UK spy thriller Embassy. Around this time, he also started working with UK-based Jamaican-born musician Carl Douglas on a 45 (rpm record) single \\"I Want to Give You My Everything\\". While this song was intended for the A side, they cut a song for the B side, \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\", in only 10 minutes. Later, at the insistence of A&R; at Pye Records, \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" was put on the A-side. Soon after release in 1974, \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" became a worldwide hit, ultimately selling eleven million copies worldwide. In 1974, it received a Gold certification,. Shortly after, Biddu also produced Carl Douglas' debut album Kung Fu Fighting and Other Great Love Songs, which produced another major hit, \\"Dance The Kung Fu\\". He soon established himself as one of the key figures in Britain's soul and disco scenes during the 1970s, working with a variety of British soul and disco artists, including Tina Charles, The Outriders, and Jimmy James. In 1975, Biddu recorded and released the instrumental LP, Blue Eyed Soul, and the album's first single, \\"Summer of '42\\", climbed to No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart, spending two months there and then had similar success in the US, topping the Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart and reached No. 57 on the Billboard Hot 100. Another single, \\"Jump for Joy\\", also topped the Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart in the US while reaching No. 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1976. In the Billboard Year-End chart, \\"Jump For Joy\\" was ranked No. 21 on the list. Also in 1975, he produced the album Can You Hear Me Ok? and single \\"I Got My Lady\\" for John Howard. Around the same time, a friend introduced Biddu to Tina Charles, a singer who had had some success singing lead vocals for the group 5000 Volts. The first single they worked together, \\"You Set My Heart on Fire\\", clinched a recording deal with CBS. In 1976, the second single \\"I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)\\" was a major hit worldwide. \\"I Love to Love\\" and the subsequent hit \\"Dance Little Lady Dance\\" sold millions of copies around the world, giving Tina Charles a worldwide audience and fame, launching her solo career and firmly establishing Biddu. In 1976, Biddu produced his own Rain Forest LP, followed by Eastern Man in 1977, both credited to Biddu & His Orchestra. His album Rain Forest earned him four Ivor Novello Awards, including the \\"Songwriter of the Year\\" award. Around this same time, he began experimenting with electronic music in some of his disco songs, making use of electronic musical instruments such as keyboards and synthesizers. Some of his early examples of electronic disco include the early boogie 1976 single \\"Bionic Boogie\\" ; the 1977 \\"Soul Coaxing\\" single; the Eastern Man and Futuristic Journey albums, which were recorded from 1976 to 1977; and the 1979 \\"Phantasm\\" single. He also began experimenting with high-tempo Hi-NRG disco music, with early examples including some of the songs in his 1976 Tina Charles albums I Love to Love and Dance Little Lady, as well as his disco singles such as \\"Voodoo Man\\" (1979) which had a tempo of 130 beats per minute. His backing tracks also had a strong influence on the British new wave band The Buggles, founded by two of Biddu's former session musicians, Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, who are most famous for writing the hit song \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" in 1979. In 1977, he worked on the Life album for the veteran Jamaican- born soul singer Jimmy James, which put out two chart hits \\"I'll Go Where your Music Takes Me\\" and \\"Disco Fever\\". In early 1978, Biddu's own \\"Journey to the Moon\\" was a hit, peaking at No. 41 in the UK. That same year, he scored the music for the English film The Stud, starring Joan Collins; the film's soundtrack was successful on the UK Albums Chart, where it reached No. 2. He also produced the soundtrack for its sequel, The Bitch, in 1979. During the late 1970s, Biddu also had a hit in France with Claude François, for whom he produced the song \\"Laisse Une Chance A Notre Amour\\". Biddu worked with various musicians including some players from Manchester and Liverpool who had worked on sessions with Tina Charles until the late 1970s, after which disco music slowly began to wane as funk, new wave and electronic music began taking centre-stage in Western popular music, taking with it Biddu's established place in the Western music scene, despite his early attempts at producing electronic synthpop music, such as his 1980 song \\"Small Talk\\" for Amy. Success in Asia (1980s) In the late 1970s, Western disco was getting popular in Asia and particularly in India, where there were not yet any home- bred disco stars. It was this reason that led established Indian filmmaker and actor Feroz Khan to England and to Biddu, in 1979. Khan wanted to introduce a catchy song in his upcoming Hindi film, Qurbani, in which the main score of the film was the Indian music duo, Kalyanji Anandji. Biddu initially was not interested in composing a Hindi film song, but later took it up as he would say years later, \\"I thought it would keep my mum happy (back home in India)\\". About the same time Khan happened to come across 15-year-old Nazia Hassan at a party in London. Khan later requested Hassan have an audition with Biddu. Biddu later signed her up for the song he was composing for Qurbani. It did not take a long time for Biddu to compose \\"Aap Jaisa Koi\\" for Qurbani. The tune and composition he used for \\"Aap Jaisa Koi\\" was similar to several of his earlier songs, particularly the 1976 Tina Charles hit \\"Dance Little Lady Dance\\". As the girl, Nazia Hassan, had a nasal voice, Biddu decided to backtrack it for an echo effect. The song which was recorded in London, was the first Hindi song to be recorded on 24 tracks. In 1980, Qurbani ran to packed houses in India, largely on the weight of \\"Aap Jaisa Koi\\" and another number \\"Laila O Laila\\". Nazia Hassan became a teenage sensation. \\"Aap Jaisa Koi\\" was a hit across the Indian subcontinent. Riding on the popularity of the song and the film, Biddu decided to sign Nazia Hassan and her brother Zoheb Hassan up for an Urdu pop album, something hitherto not tried in India. Biddu modeled them on the then-popular American brother-sister duo, The Carpenters. Biddu composed a few catchy numbers for Nazia and Zoheb for the album Disco Deewane. In 1981, the album was a hit across Asia, South Africa, and some countries in South America (particularly Brazil where it topped the chart), charting in 14 countries. The album became the best-selling Asian pop album up until that time. The 15-year-old teenage Pakistani singer Nazia Hassan became a household name across South Asia. Disco Deewane was followed by the production of three more heavy hitters with Nazia and Zohaib; Star/Boom Boom in 1982 (the number \\"Boom Boom\\" from the album and film Star was a hit), then the album Young Tarang 1984 two years later, before winding up again with the duo in 1987 with Hotline. The duo went on to sell 60 million records worldwide. Beyond Southern Asia, he also had some success in another part of Asia, the Far East. After having previously had a chart-topping hit in Japan with The Tigers in 1969, he returned there to work with the popular Japanese idol and J-pop singer Akina Nakamori, for whom he produced \\"Don't Tell Me This is Love\\" in 1985. It was included in her 1985 album My Best Thanks, which topped the Japanese chart and sold around 300,000 copies. He produced several more hit songs for Akina Nakamori, including the 1987 songs \\"The Look That Kills\\" and \\"Blonde\\", (Translation) which became chart-topping hits in Japan. \\"Blonde\\" in particular sold over 300,000 copies in Japan that year. He also worked in Hong Kong, where he produced and composed the song \\"傷心戲院\\" (\\"Sad Theater\\") for C-pop singer Samantha Lam in 1988. (Translation) In the Philippines, the song \\"Chic-Chica-Chic-Chica-Chic\\" from his hit 1976 album Rainforest was used as the main theme of the popular 1980s sitcom Chicks to Chicks. In the late 1980s, he returned to the UK music scene with house music records such as \\"Humanity\\" (1989). Indian pop scene (1990s) Having spent nearly a decade with the Nazia-Zohaib pair, Biddu next turned his attention to Hindi vocalist Shweta Shetty, both writing and producing the Johnny Joker album in 1993. Then in 1995, came another album, composed and produced by Biddu. Made in India – a dance album for the Hindi pop/film playback singer Alisha Chinai. The album became the best selling Hindi dance album and featured a handful of Western styled videos – a selling point for India's newly launched MTV channel. It topped the Indian chart, where it remained for over a year, and sold over five million copies in India. In 1996, Biddu made a brother-sister duo popular again with Shaan (Shantanu Mukherjee) and Sagarika Mukherjee, producing the Naujawan album. Biddu spent the rest of the 1990s working with a variety of musicians, including the Indian girl-group The Models, and Sonu Nigam, as well as continuing his collaboration with Alisha Chinai on her Dil Ki Rani album. Into the new millennium, he produced two hit albums with Sansara, Yeh Dil Sun Raha Hai and Habibi. His own 1999 album, Eastern Journey, was an experiment which blended Indian pop with Western flair and strong, jazz elements. Biddu also worked with Junaid Jamshed. Both of them worked in London and produced an album under the composition and lyrics of Shoib Mansoor Sahab. Experiments in fusion (2000s) In 2004, Biddu re- emerged with the album Diamond Sutra. Biddu now lives in Spain with his English wife of 39 years, Sue, and two grown-up children. He started a publishing house called SueBiddu Music, which administers music for artists, wrote an autobiography called Made in India at the insistence of his wife, and has returned to live performances as a singer. In 2010, Biddu won an \\"Outstanding Achievement\\" award at the UK Asian Music Awards (UK AMAs), and he was also awarded the \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" at the JD Rock Awards in India that same year.

Various research demonstrates that young people are in need of support to navigate through these issues and that they want trustworthy, relatable and trained people to deliver their relationships and sex education in a way that engages and inspires them. Instead of traditional solutions that merely address the biology behind sex, acet UK and its international partners, and the people they train, offer relationships and sex education that invests in the development of young people's self-esteem and attitudes, encouraging them to value other people and value sex.  The HIV landscape  Acet UK began in the 1980s, as a compassionate response to the HIV and AIDS pandemic. The HIV landscape, has of course, changed considerably since then. There have been substantial advances in antiretroviral treatment and vast improvements in the accessibility of the medication. However, stigma and discrimination are still present, in many countries not everyone who needs the treatment has access to it and HIV still has a significant impact on the lives of millions of adults and children across the world. Therefore, helping to facilitate the delivery of HIV prevention, care and support programmes in a number of key communities continues to be a priority. History In his work as a physician in the 1980s, ACET founder, Dr Patrick Dixon, began to meet patients with HIV, who had been refused care at home or in hospices as a result of the fear and discrimination that surrounded a then largely unknown and misunderstood virus. Following the publication of his book The Truth About AIDS, Patrick founded ACET in 1988, as a compassionate response to the HIV pandemic. ACET grew rapidly, providing home care for HIV/AIDS patients across Greater London, as well as delivering an HIV prevention program in schools. Trained volunteers were supported by a professional team, and soon home care and schools teams developed in other parts of the UK. Independent ACET teams were also established in Uganda, Thailand, Romania and other countries. In the UK, partly as a result of campaigning by ACET, the National Health Service eventually took responsibility for the care of HIV patients. Awareness of how the virus is transmitted and can be prevented grew, and the first anti- retroviral medicines, which could control the HIV virus and prevent AIDS from developing, were made available. However, HIV and AIDS remained a huge problem in other countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of knowledge about the virus, stigma and poor access to treatment resulted in the rapid spread of HIV, many AIDS deaths and millions of children being orphaned. acet UK began to focus on providing technical and financial support for other ACET teams who were working in countries facing these challenges. In the meantime, the UK schools program developed to become Esteem, which now covered a wider spectrum of relationships and sex education. In 2002, Esteem became part of Oasis Trust and then an independent charity in 2011. Throughout all these changes, Esteem and acet UK continued to work closely together, and in 2014 Esteem once again became an acet UK project. acet UK's Esteem team now equip youth and schools workers, teachers and health professionals with the knowledge, skills, resources, and confidence to educate young people across the UK about relationships and sex. They also deliver the program directly to young people themselves, with best practice models in Southwark and Cheshire, and are increasingly working with parents to support them in engaging with their children on these topics. Many of the ACET teams overseas have also developed their services in response to the needs of their own beneficiaries: services include prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, HIV testing and counselling, support of orphans and vulnerable children, as well as training and capacity-building of churches and community organisations to deliver high- impact HIV care and prevention programs. Activities acet UK's work includes: * Educating young people through their Esteem program * Sharing their expertise on these issues through delivering Esteem training and providing resources to those who work with young people and communities, including youth workers, teachers and health practitioners * Providing support to parents on how to talk to their children about relationships and sex * Training and mobilising churches to facilitate conversations around relationships and sex * Working with and training international partners who share acet UK's vision and mission and who are committed to mobilising the church to promote healthy relationships, improve sexual health and respond to the HIV pandemic * Providing a channel for donors to support the work of acet UK's international partners in delivering education and training, and care for those whose lives have been affected by HIV/AIDS See also *Patrick Dixon, founder of ACET External links * acet UK website * АСЕТ Ukraine website  ACET Ireland website * ACET Belarus website References Category:HIV/AIDS organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Health charities in the United Kingdom ","title":"ACET (AIDS charity)"},{"id":"4509676","text":"Polygonum species (knotweeds) are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including: Monophagous Species which feed exclusively on Polygonum * Coleophoridae ** Several Coleophora case-bearer species: *** C. borea *** C. shaleriella Polyphagous Species which feed on Polygonum and other plants * Gelechiidae ** Chionodes discoocellella * Geometridae ** Idaea aversata (riband wave) ** Idaea biselata (small fan-footed wave) ** Orthonama obstipata (gem) - leaves ** Timandra comae (blood-vein) * Noctuidae ** Agrotis clavis (heart and club) ** Agrotis exclamationis (heart and dart) ** Axylia putris (flame) ** Euxoa nigricans (garden dart) ** Melanchra persicariae (dot moth) ** Orthosia gothica (Hebrew character) External links * Polygonum +Lepidoptera ","title":"List of Lepidoptera that feed on Polygonum"},{"id":"4509682","text":"Cheryl Benard (born in 1953) is an academic scholar, writer, political scientist and novelist.

It is linguistically close to Tuscan and Standard Italian, with some notable differences from these two. Rich in vivid expressions and sayings, Romanesco is used in a typical diglossic setting, mainly for informal/colloquial communication, with code-switching and translanguaging with the standard language. History The young Giuseppe Gioachino Belli The medieval Roman dialect belonged to the southern family of Italian dialects, and was thus much closer to the Neapolitan language than to the Florentine. A typical example of Romanesco of that period is Vita di Cola di Rienzo (\\"Life of Cola di Rienzo\\"), written by an anonymous Roman during the 14th century. Starting with the 16th century, the Roman dialect underwent a stronger and stronger influence from the Tuscan dialect (from which modern Italian derives) starting with the reigns of the two Medici popes (Leo X and Clement VII) and with the Sack of Rome in 1527, two events which provoked a large immigration from Tuscany. Therefore, current Romanesco has grammar and roots that are rather different from other dialects in Central Italy. The path towards a progressive Tuscanization of the dialect can be observed in the works of the major Romanesco writers and poets of the past two centuries: Giuseppe Gioachino Belli (1791-1863), whose sonetti romaneschi represent the most important work in this dialect and an eternal monument to 19th century Roman people; Cesare Pascarella (1858-1940); Giggi Zanazzo (1860-1911); and Carlo Alberto Salustri (1871-1950), nicknamed Trilussa. Diffusion Before Rome became the capital city of Italy, Romanesco was spoken only inside the walls of the city, while the little towns surrounding Rome had their own dialects. Nowadays, these dialects have been replaced with a variant of Romanesco, which therefore is now spoken in an area larger than the original one. It slightly pervades the everyday language of most of the immigrants who live in the large city. Pronunciation Romanesco pronunciation and spelling differs from Standard Italian in these cases: * is used where standard Italian uses . This is spelt \\"J\\", a letter which is no longer used in Italian. Compare Italian \\"son\\" and Romanesco ; *geminate (\\"rolled r\\" or alveolar trill) does not exist anymore: for example, ; ( \\"light blue\\"), ( \\"he/she would come\\"). A Roman pun recites: \\"\\" (): note that and are also \\"wrong\\", as they are and in Standard Italian. This phenomenon presumably developed after 1870, as it was not present in the classical 19th century Romanesco of Belli; * becomes before another consonant: , Italian \\"money\\"; *in Romanesco, as in most Central and Southern Italian languages and dialects, and are always geminated where permissible: e.g. for Standard Italian \\"book\\", for \\"diary, agenda\\". Noteworthy figures Today, Romanesco is generally considered more of a regional idiom than a true language. Classical Romanesco, which reached high literature with Belli, has disappeared. External forces such as immigration and the dominance of Italian are playing a role in the transformation.

The memorial is an important Hungarian national symbol and scene of official celebrations. First memorial After the death of Lajos Kossuth (21 March 1894) and his sumptuous funeral in Budapest a public subscription was almost immediately announced to build a memorial for the leader of the 1848 Revolution. During the next years 850,000 forints came together, a huge sum in those days. In 1906 the competition was won by János Horvay after long debates about the style and message of the memorial. Although the public was dissatisfied with Horvay’s idea the sculptor began working. Until 1914 all the figures of the group were completed except Kossuth himself but then the work came to a halt because of World War I. The colossal Ruskica marble plinth remained in the quarry in Transylvania and was confiscated by the invading Romanian troops. In the years following the war Horvay completed the Kossuth statue and a new plinth was made of simple limestone. The first Kossuth Memorial was officially inaugurated on 6 November 1927 by Governor Miklós Horthy before a crowd of 100,000 people. The speaker of the celebration was Albert Apponyi. The group depicted the members of the first Hungarian parliamentary government: Lajos Kossuth (in the middle), Pál Esterházy, Gábor Klauzál, József Eötvös, István Széchenyi, Prime Minister Lajos Batthyány, Bertalan Szemere, Ferenc Deák and Lázár Mészáros. Horvay’s composition was criticised because Kossuth played only a minor constitutional role in the first cabinet. Art critics condemned the melancholic atmosphere of the memorial and the sculpture remained somewhat unpopular. Second memorial In 1950 the government of Mátyás Rákosi, the Stalinist dictator of Hungary ordered the dismantling of the „pessimistic” memorial. Zsigmond Kisfaludi Strobl made a new bronze statue of Kossuth pointing towards a brighter future with a raised hand. Although the sculpture is a typical product of its age, Kisfaludi Strobl was a talented artist who managed to picture Kossuth as a great orator. The new memorial was inaugurated in 1952. The six other figures (among them poet Sándor Petőfi) were made by András Kocsis and Lajos Ungváry. The plinth was clad with red marble blocks. The dismantled Horvay-group was given to the town of Dombóvár in 1959 where the figures were separately re- erected in 1973 in the City Park. Third memorial The Hungarian government launched the overall rehabilitation of Kossuth Lajos Square in 2012 after a long period of planning. A parliamentary decision ordered the reconstruction of the historical sculptures of the square as they appeared in 1944. Strobl's Kossuth Memorial was deconstructed, then reassembled in Orczy Park in a different formation. An exact copy of the original sculpture group by Horvay (preserved in Dombóvár) was recreated and unveiled in Kossuth Square in 2014.

It is widely considered Schubert's most technically demanding composition for the piano. Schubert himself said \\"the devil may play it,\\" in reference to his own inability to do so properly.  Historical background  Schubert composed this work in late 1822, just after breaking off work on the Unfinished Symphony while sketching its incomplete scherzo. It was written for and dedicated to Carl Emanuel Liebenberg von Zsittin, who had studied piano with Johann Nepomuk Hummel, in the hope of some remuneration from the dedication. It is not only a technically formidable challenge for the performer, but also a structurally formidable four-movement work combining theme-and-variations with sonata form. Each movement transitions into the next instead of ending with a final definitive cadence, and each starts with a variation of the opening phrase of his lied \\"Der Wanderer\\", D. 489. The second movement, marked \\"adagio,\\" states the theme in virtually the same way it is presented in the song, whereas the three fast movements begin with variants in diminution (that is, shortened note values): the first movement, \\"allegro con fuoco ma non troppo,\\" a monothematic sonata form in which the second theme is another variant, the third, \\"presto,\\" a scherzo in triple meter, and the finale, marked simply \\"allegro,\\" starting as a quasi-fugue and making increasing demands on the player's technical and interpretive powers as it storms on to its conclusion.  Structure  The whole work is based on one single basic motive from which all themes are developed. This motive is distilled from the theme of the C-sharp minor second movement, which is a sequence of variations on a melody taken from the lied \\"Der Wanderer\\", which Schubert wrote in 1816. It is this set of variations from which the work's popular name is derived. The four movements are played without a break. After the first movement Allegro con fuoco ma non troppo in C major and the second movement Adagio (which begins in C-sharp minor and ends in E major), follow a scherzo presto in A-flat major and the technically transcendental finale, which starts in fugato returning to the key of C major and becomes more and more virtuosic as it moves toward its thunderous nonfugal conclusion.  Liszt's transcriptions  The Hungarian composer Franz Liszt, who was fascinated by the Wanderer Fantasy, transcribed it for piano and orchestra (S.366) and two pianos (S.653). He additionally edited the original score and added some various interpretations in ossia, and made a complete rearrangement of the final movement (S.565a).

Lindgren was convicted of nine counts of sexual assault in 2006, two of which were labeled attempted murder, in relation to attacks in the city of Umeå from 1998 to 2005. The attacks were all made outdoors, involved physical violence and in some cases attempts to kill his victims. The nickname \\"Hagamannen\\" refers to the area in Umeå named Haga where Lindgren made his first assault. Lindgren was identified and arrested by the Swedish police after they received a tip from the public on March 29, 2006. His DNA matched the DNA previously secured from the victims. On April 22 Lindgren confessed to six of the assaults. On July 19 he was convicted of eight assaults by the Umeå District Court and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Lindgren appealed to the Upper Norrland Court of Appeal, which on October 2 upheld the district court's sentence plus one case of rape in 2000. Lindgren's appeal to the Supreme Court was not granted. Lindgren was released on July 28, 2015 and is now on probation after nine years served. On August 22, 2015 he was hit in the head with a golf club. On 13 November 2015, the three suspected attackers were found not guilty of Lindgren's assault.  Partial list of attacks  *August 1998: a 14-year-old girl is assaulted. *1:20 a.m, 9 May 1999: a 26-year-old woman is assaulted and raped in a park in Haga. *6 November 1999: three women are assaulted in three different locations in Haga. One of the women is raped. *19 March 2000: a 22-year-old woman is assaulted on Brandmannagatan. *19 March 2000: a 22-year-old woman is assaulted and raped in the university area. The woman almost died from her injuries and hypothermia. *1 December 2000: a 15-year-old girl is assaulted and raped in Ersboda. *Between 1 and 2 a.m, 10 December 2005: A 51-year-old woman is brutally assaulted and raped at Tegsbron. The woman was seriously injured and fought for her life while her assailant attempted to drag her to the edge of the ice covering the banks of the Ume river and throw her into the icy waters. The perpetrator bit her ear off during the assault, but police were able to locate it by using police dogs, and it was reattached at the university hospital. *13–15 December 2005: Two more women are assaulted, one at Tegsbrob and another at the Mimerskolan. It is still not certain that the perpetrator in these cases was Hagamannen.  Police investigation  The investigation to find Hagamannen was one of the largest ever in Sweden. More than 30 policemen worked full-time to catch the serial rapist, but the investigation met some setbacks. For example: *The police received a tip from a woman at the university hospital in the year 2000 that a father of a newborn child bore a striking resemblance to the facial composite, but the police dismissed this tip. According to the woman she was told that it was unlikely that the father of a newborn child would be the perpetrator of such crimes. The suspect now in custody was at the university hospital at the time with a newborn child, and several assaults took place within the vicinity of the hospital at the time. The police are holding an internal investigation into why the tip was not taken more seriously. *With the knowledge that the perpetrator had unusually small feet, the Swedish police attempted to access armed forces records. All Swedish men are required to register with the armed forces, who in turn determine their suitability for military service. During this selection a physical examination is performed and records are kept in case the need arises for further conscripts. The armed forces refused to hand over their records or allow access. *DNA samples are taken from all children in Sweden in order to be used for medical research into hereditary illnesses at the PKU lab (the lab gets its name from Phenylketonuria). The police wanted to access this database in order to yield a suspect, but the lab refused. Some individuals have requested that their samples be destroyed; the police requested records of destroyed samples, but the lab refused. *The suspect was found by forcefully mass DNA testing males in the area. A matching profile was found after 777 tests. \\"Den 777:e mannen : polisens jakt på Hagamannen\\", C. Andersson and A. Boström, Big Bok förlag, *The police then considered using a plainclothes female police officer in order to draw the perpetrator out, but this idea was discarded since such behaviour on the part of the police would constitute entrapment (\\"brottsprovokation\\") which is not allowed under Swedish law, according to JO (Ombudsmen of Justice, elected by the Swedish Government to ensure that the Swedish Government and its employees are following Swedish law.) *Before taking him into custody the police spent some time observing the suspect's daily routine. The suspect apparently liked to spend a lot of time alone in the garage that he built adjacent to his house. The locations that the police mapped out served as a basis for the police interrogation and are therefore likely to be thoroughly examined by police forensic technicians. *The facial composite has been a central point of the investigation, and its release to the media and general public ultimately proved to be what would yield the first suspect in the case. The police are also examining one unsolved murder and one death which took place under mysterious circumstances during the time that the Hagamannen was active. The DNA match will likely be the key evidence in tying the suspect to the crimes at trial.  Evidence  According to media reports, there are several facts in the case which indicate that the man which the police had in custody was the perpetrator: *DNA: The Swedish Police and Swedish State Criminalistics Lab secured DNA samples from at least three of the crime scenes. The DNA from the crime scene near the Ume River (where the 51 year old victim was assaulted) matched the suspect's DNA. According to the criminalistics lab the probability of error is one in one million samples, which they characterize as a nine on a scale from one to nine. *Facial composite: The suspect bears a striking resemblance to the facial composite- indeed he even jokingly referred to himself as Hagamannen when talking to his co-workers . *Height: The perpetrator is unusually short for a man. The suspect is also unusually short for a man. *Shoe size: The perpetrator has unusually small feet for a man, which the police have been able to determine by analyzing footprints left by the perpetrator. The suspect also has small feet, his co-workers even joked that he could be the perpetrator because of his unusually small feet. *Proximity: The suspect works in a car-repair shop in the Haga part of Umeå, which is within the vicinity of many of the attacks. He had 24-hour access to his place of employment. The police theorize that the suspect may have used his place of employment as a base to look for potential victims. *\\"Trophies\\": The police state that the perpetrator took \\"trophies\\" from at least three of his victims, such as identification documents. The police are searching premises that the perpetrator had access to in order to secure such trophies if they are in the possession of the perpetrator or in a location to which he had access. On 9 April 2006 the Police discovered a property located far from the suspect's residence and place of employment to which the suspect also had 24-hour access. The newly discovered property lies close to where some of the attacks took place. *Line-up: In cases where the perpetrator did not leave any DNA evidence, or where the victim was able to escape, a police lineup can be used to identify the perpetrator. *Knife: The police are also looking for a knife or knives used by the perpetrator in the property of the suspect, or in places to which he had access. *Alibi and other circumstantial evidence.  Arrest  In response to a tip from the public regarding Lindgren's resemblance to the facial composite, the police approached him for a voluntary DNA sample. Lindgren refused, but was compelled to provide the sample in accordance with a new law after being interviewed by police. On 29 March 2006, police learned that the DNA sample matched those taken from the crime scenes. Two plainclothes officers were sent to Lindgren's place of employment. They arrived during his lunch break; Lindgren failed to return to work after lunch. Later that afternoon police released a media report indicating that they had arrested a suspect in relation to the attacks.  Suspect in custody  Lingren was described in media reports as a 33-year-old man living just outside Umeå, a Swedish citizen with no criminal record who was now suspected by the police as the alleged perpetrator until January 2006. He worked at a VAG car sales and repair shop as a sheet-metal worker, and was described as a normal family father with a common-law marriage and two children. He lived in Nyland, a small tight-knit community outside of Umeå.  Court proceedings  Under Swedish law a suspect can only be held for a short period of time by the police before they have to be arraigned. On 31 March 2006 at 3 p.m. the suspect was arraigned before the Umeå Court. For security reasons the hearing took place in the secure courtroom. Much of the hearing took place behind closed doors, due to the nature of the crimes. A suspect can be held for an indefinite period of time prior to a trial, but the police and prosecutor have to show cause for this at arraignment hearings which have to be held at regular intervals. A suspect is allowed to request a defense attorney, Lindgren in this case requested Leif Silbersky, who was appointed as his public defender by the Umeå District Court. Niklas Lingren was charged with four counts of assault, four counts of rape and two counts of attempted murder. At first he pleaded innocent to all charges against him. On April 22 he confessed that he attacked six women.  Prison  A person suspected of a serious offence and who is awaiting trial is normally held by the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. The suspect is normally not allowed any visitors or to communicate with the outside world, with the exception of his attorney, until the trial is concluded. The suspect is allowed to read books and magazines with the exception of material covering the case against the suspect. The reasoning for incarceration and isolation is that the suspect might resort to further crime, try to influence witnesses, alter his or her own statements or glean information useful for when he or she goes through a psychiatric evaluation.  Media coverage  The case received extensive coverage in Swedish newspapers and on Swedish television. During the years 1998-2006 many people, mainly women in the city of Umeå, were afraid to walk alone at night.  Publication of name and picture  The Swedish newspaper Expressen published the name of the suspect together with his photograph shortly after his arrest by the police. A photograph of Lindgren was featured side-by-side with a composite sketch released by the police on the cover of the newspaper the day after his arrest. The publication of the name and photograph of the suspect has been criticized by some since it can hamper the police investigation, reduce the evidentiary value of a police lineup for the cases where there is no other physical evidence and since it causes emotional suffering for the victims, the suspects family and friends and the suspect himself if he is later acquitted. The editor of the newspaper defended the publication, stating that it could prompt other victims to report assaults, that the suspect was in custody, that there was a strong interest from the public who have a right to know (the purpose of the journalist) and that the evidence against the suspect in this case is especially damning. When he became aware of the publication through his lawyer Leif Silbersky, Lindgren reported the publication to the Press Ombudsman, who can decide to bring the matter before the Swedish Press Council. The Swedish Press Countil will then offer an opinion on whether the publication was in line with good journalistic practice. The publication of the name and photograph of the suspect in this case can be compared to the murder of Foreign Minister Anna Lindh in 2003 where the daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter choose to publish the name of the suspect (who was later convicted) while he was still at large. The publication at that time was justified by the newspaper since the killer was at large and that the police had already released a photograph to aid in his capture, a practice which was also done with the Malexander police killers Tony Olsson, Andreas Axelsson and Jackie Arklöv. There is a difference in tradition between Sweden and other countries when it comes to the publication of a name and footage or photograph of a suspect. For instance, in the U.S. it is customary for the media to use the real name of a suspect, while in Sweden a suspect is usually referred to by their age (i.e. the 33-year old in the present case) until a conviction has been secured.

They have sold 2.6 million records worldwide. The band consists of Jade Jones, Rahsaan J Bromfield, Andrez Harriott, Coreé Richards and Noel Simpson. History 1995–1999: Formation and Forever The band was formed by Rahsaan \\"Ras\\" Bromfield and Noel Simpson who were students at the Barbara Speake Stage School in the London neighbourhood of Acton. They rapped and danced at school assemblies. Jade Jones was brought into the band when Bromfield and Simpson heard him sing a high note. Andrez Harriott, a student at Sylvia Young Theatre School, was recruited after he and Jones performed together in the musical play Carmen Jones. Coreé Richards was asked to join the band after he was heard singing at a bus stop. The band sent a demo tape of a cover version of the Jackson 5 song \\"Anything\\" to Jazz Summers of Big Life Records in early 1995. Damage made inroads into the UK Singles Chart and the second single \\"Love II Love\\" reached number 12 while the follow-up, \\"Forever\\", charted at number 6 during the Christmas period. \\"Forever\\" was also notable for being both the first song that Steve Mac and Wayne Hector wrote together, and the song that caught the ear of Simon Cowell and effectively led to Mac becoming the chief songwriter-producer for Cowell's subsequent projects. Damage's debut album Forever followed in 1997, along with two further UK top 10 singles – \\"Love Guaranteed\\" and a cover version of Eric Clapton's \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", the latter reaching number 3. The quintet subsequently embarked on an extensive touring schedule while negotiating a new recording contract following the collapse of Big Life. Jones remained in the media spotlight through his long-term romance with Emma Bunton of the Spice Girls.\\"Former Spice Girl Emma Bunton engaged to Jade Jones\\", Newsbeat, BBC, 25 January 2011.\\"Emma Bunton has a baby boy\\", Now, 10 August 2007. 2000–2001: Since You've Been Gone and split In 2000, they signed with Cooltempo Records and released the second album's first single, \\"Ghetto Romance\\". The song was produced by production duo Tim & Bob, and peaked at No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart.UK Singles Chart, Week Listing On 30 August, \\"Rumours\\" was released as second single. The song is a mixture of R&B; and 2-step. The CD2 single contains UK garage remixes of \\"Rumours\\" and their previous single \\"Ghetto Romance\\", as remixed by Ed Case & Carl H and Groove Chronicles, respectively. The second album was initially due for release on 25 September 2000, following the release of \\"Rumours\\". However, the release date was subsequently pushed back to allow for new material to be recorded. This resulted in the album's track listing being revised. The initial track listing includes the tracks \\"Feelin' Me\\" and \\"Midnight Caller\\", as well as an outro called \\"Before We Leave\\". The second album, Since You've Been Gone, was released on 2 April 2001. However, the final release omits the last tracks and instead replaces them with \\"I Don't Know\\" (featuring Emma Bunton), \\"After the Love Has Gone\\" and a Mushtaq mix of \\"So What If I\\".Danny Walker, \\"Big Reunion bosses had 'security on standby' for boyband Damage's ITV2 comeback\\", Mirror, 6 February 2014.

Another early mention dates from 803 during the reign of Charlemagne, this time identifying the borders of the newly established Bishopric of Halberstadt. Neither of these sources pins down a date for the foundation of Wittingen, however. During the Medieval period Wittingen was not merely a frontier point, but also a focus for traffic crossing into and out of the Altmark. The town was a trading point and an overnight stop for east-west commerce. Its significance was signaled in the ninth century when The Bishopric had the Church of St Stephen built. By the beginning of the thirteenth century Wittingen had been granted Town privileges, and was a part owner of the Lüneburg Mint. The fourteenth century was a period of political instability in this part of Europe and in 1340 ownership of Wittingen was transferred to the Welfs of Celle. Later, with the outbreak of the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud, the town was almost completely destroyed in 1519. Consequently, the building of town fortifications began shortly afterwards.

Atkinson spoke against a proposed Clean Environment Commission review of the Maple Leaf project in 1998, describing it as a stalling tactic, and supported provincial Environment Minister Jim McCrae's conclusion that a formal review would not be necessary during the construction phase.Bud Robertson, \\"Review could delay hog plant\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 1998, A9; Helen Fallding, \\"Hog plant allowed to skip hearing\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 September 1998, A1. He also opposed a request from councillors in the nearby Long Plain First Nation for a federal environmental assessment.Helen Fallding, \\"Band wants feds to halt hog plant\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 July 1998, A8. Construction of the plant began in April 1998, and operations began in August 1999.Bud Robertson, \\"McCain breaks ground on massive Brandon plant\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 April 1998, B6; Helen Fallding, \\"New economic era begins when first hog butchered\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 August 1999, A1. Atkinson was easily re-elected in 1998, defeating two minor challengers who criticized aspects of the Maple Leaf deal.Helen Fallding, \\"Brandonites fork over big, fat mandate to pro pork-plant mayor\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 October 1998, A12. The following year, he led council in approving a plan for the city to own and operate a wastewater treatment plant to serve the Maple Leaf facility.Helen Fallding, \\"Brandon council votes to keep waste plant\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 February 1999, A3. The project ultimately cost $13.5 million (some of which was paid by the province), and was derided by critics as \\"corporate welfare\\".\\"His Honour, Mr. Business\\", Manitoba Business, 1 March 1999, p. 14. See \\"Waste water treatment plant announced for Brandon\\", M2 Presswire, 14 May 1999. The city administrator responded to this charge by arguing that most of the money went to improving Brandon's existing capacity for water and wastewater treatment.Helen Fallding, \\"Give Schneider's 'well-run' city\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 December 1999, A9. ;Other issues Atkinson helped coordinate other projects for the city. Simplot opened a new Brandon facility in 1999, setting up a $230 million plant for liquid and granular fertilizers.Geoff Kirbyson, \\"Simplot enjoys growth spurt\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 September 1999, B9. See also Helen Fallding, \\"Simplot plays ball with Brandon\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 January 2000, A8.

Atkinson rejected at least two proposals from aboriginal groups to construct a casino in Brandon. He opposes casinos on principle, arguing that they contribute to gambling addictions and provide few social benefits in return. He also opposes the separate taxation system for urban reserve lands, and believes that aboriginal Canadians should fall under the same tax apparatus as non-aboriginals.Helen Fallding, \\"Minnedosa Monte Carlo of the Prairies?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 November 1998, A4; Helen Fallding, \\"Brandon mayor gives first nation cold shoulder\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 January 2000, A2. Atkinson was once quoted as saying, \\"It will be a frosty day in July before I sign the papers to allow a casino in Brandon. It will just be a vacuum cleaner that will suck people's money right out of their pockets.\\" See Daniel Lett, \\"Casino plans luck out for 5 first nations\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 2000, A3. Notwithstanding his views on casinos, Atkinson supported using Video Lottery Terminals to raise revenues, and rejected calls for a plebiscite on the issue.Bud Robertson, \\"Few eager to hold VLT vote\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 July 1998, A4. Atkinson was a prominent supporter of a plan to move the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry from Winnipeg to the Canadian Forces Base Shilo in Brandon, and welcomed Defence Minister Art Eggleton's decision to approve the transfer in early 2001.Helen Fallding, \\"Task force to help new residents\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 April 2001, B2. Late in his term, Atkinson led council in approving a comprehensive by-law against indoor smoking, with no age limits or exemptions for bars.Leah Hendry, \\"No public smoking indoors, period!\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 April 2002, A12; \\"Brandon passes what is being called toughest smoking ban in North America\\", Canadian Press, 28 May 2002, 20:12. ;Style Atkinson promoted a \\"down-to-earth\\" and populist approach to politics. He wore a loud yellow shirt and happy face tie to an all-candidates debate in 1998, and was quoted as saying, \\"I don't use a lot of big words because I don't know them\\".Helen Fallding, \\"Brandon mayoral hopefuls mark territory\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 October 1998, A3. The journal Manitoba Business once described his political style as \\"gregarious\\". ;Retirement from municipal politics Atkinson unexpectedly announced that he would not seek re-election in 2002.\\"Atkinson won't run again\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 August 2002, A10. This article indicates that Atkinson's relationship with Rick Borotsik, whom he replaced as mayor, was very poor. Atkinson is the current Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Cornwallis which surrounds Brandon on three sides.  Federal and provincial politics  Atkinson sought the Canadian Alliance nomination to contest Brandon—Souris in the 2000 federal election. He unexpectedly lost to Gary Nestibo.\\"Nestibo gets nod\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 October 2000, A3; Helen Fallding, \\"Alliance stars faltering\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 October 2000, A1. He campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 2003 as the Progressive Conservative candidate in Brandon West, and lost to New Democratic Party incumbent Scott Smith by a wide margin.Mike McIntyre, \\"NDP scores historic victory in Brandon\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 June 2003, B2.  Electoral record  113 of 121 polls reporting. Atkinson was elected mayor of Hartney in either 1980 or 1981, and re-elected in 1983 and 1986. All provincial election information is taken from Elections Manitoba. The 1998 mayoral results are taken from the Winnipeg Free Press, 29 October 1998, A13. The final results did not significantly change Atkinson's margin of victory.

Three such boxes completed a 36-plane group box. The combat box was a tactical formation used by heavy (strategic) bombers of the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. The combat box was also referred to as a \\"staggered formation\\". Its defensive purpose was in massing the firepower of the bombers' guns, while offensively it concentrated the release of bombs on a target. Initially formations were created in keeping with the pre-war Air Corps doctrine that massed bombers could attack and destroy targets in daylight without fighter escort, relying on interlocking fire from their defensive machine guns, almost exclusively the \\"light barrel\\" Browning AN/M2 .50-calibre (12.7 mm) gun. However the use of high altitudes by USAAF bombers resulted in factors that demanded a tighter bomb pattern and the combat box continued in use even after the advent of fighter escort – and especially starting in the spring of 1944 over Europe, with USAAF fighters flying far ahead of the combat boxes in air supremacy mode instead against the Luftwaffe's fighters – largely mitigated the threat of fighter interception. Creation of the concept is credited to Colonel Curtis E. LeMay, commander of the 305th Bombardment Group in England. However the Eighth Air Force had been experimenting with different tactical formations since its first bombing mission on 17 August 1942, several of which were also known as \\"boxes.\\" LeMay's group did create the \\"Javelin Down\\" combat box in December 1942, and that formation became the basis for the numerous variations of combat boxes that followed. The practice of referring to a concentrated formation as a \\"box\\" was the result of diagramming formations in plan, profile and front elevation views, positioning each individual bomber in an invisible boxlike area. The evolution of Eighth Air Force formations  1942 experiments Combat boxes of 3rd Bomb Division B-17s B-24s of the 446th Bomb Group fly in combat box formation. The first ten missions of the Eighth Air Force from England in August 1942 were shallow penetrations of France strongly supported by Royal Air Force Spitfire fighter escorts. B-17 Flying Fortresses flew in six-plane squadrons with two to four miles between squadrons, to avoid mid-air collisions between the inexperienced crews. Although unable to support each other, the six-plane squadrons had the virtues of simplicity and ease of control. The bombers within a squadron were stacked at three altitudes with approximately between the highest and lowest, and except for the lead pair, were not in mutually supporting elements. As missions grew larger in size, deeper in penetration, and faced increasingly effective defenders, the AAF recognized that more compact formations were needed and returned to the three- aircraft vee formation that had been standard before the war. Squadrons consisted of three such vees, all flying at the same altitude, with two such squadrons in a group formation, the second higher, trailing, and staggered to the right. The entire formation was high, deep, and nearly across. It proved cumbersome to maneuver, as did a 36-plane alternative, and left many bomber gunners with restricted fields of fire. The original two heavy bomb groups of the Eighth Air Force transferred to North Africa and were replaced in October and November by four new groups of B-17s (the 306th, 91st, 303rd, and 305th groups), and two of B-24 Liberators (44th and 93rd BGs), each of which experimented with its own formations. Their early missions included numerous mechanical turnbacks (\\"aborts\\") which hampered development of effective schemes. Between November 1942 and the end of the war various configurations of the combat box were adopted to meet changing conditions, particularly changed German tactics that stressed head-on attacks against the weak forward firepower of the bombers. The 305th BG innovated the 18-aircraft \\"Javelin Down\\" formation, which stacked planes within an element and squadrons within a group downwards in the direction of the sun. This aided gunners on the higher aircraft in seeing lower aircraft without being blinded by glare. In the front elevation the formation resembled a set of stairs, but in profile and plan resembled a spear point. Unlike earlier group formations in which the lead bomber had flown in the lowest position, it now was placed in the center of the formation vertically. The 305th successfully tested the formation on a December 6, 1942, mission to Lille, and it was immediately adopted by the other three B-17 groups. The 305th soon developed a more compact staggered formation that stacked elements downward in one direction, but stacked squadrons upward in the opposite direction. A third element of three bombers was added to the 18-plane box, placed in the most exposed squadron for additional support. This resulted in a 21-plane wedge-shaped configuration that was adopted by all groups on January 13, 1943, and remained standard through September 1943. In 1943, the use of assembly ships, modified older bombers with unique paint schemes, to organize combat boxes was devised. These planes continued to be used throughout the war, even with the invention of other technological advances. Wing boxes Although the combat box was initially designed around a group of airplanes, it was expanded to include a formation of three groups flying together as a \\"combat wing\\", all of which were based on the same triangular design of a leading bomber (or grouping of bombers) in the center, and two bombers (or groupings) immediately behind in a vee shape, with one at an altitude above and one below the center in close proximity for mutual defense. The new combat boxes continued to be used, but groups were placed in a horizontal column and stacked at increasing altitude to decrease their vulnerability to attack. This resulted in the rear formations lagging behind which impacted both defensive tactics and bombing performance. This applied only to B-17 groups until September 1943, because of the fewer number of B-24 groups and their different performance characteristics. The wing box, a 54-plane formation (basically three 18-plane boxes stacked in a similar fashion to the group box), evolved from a need to provide defensive fire against head-on attacks. The formations were stacked so that while squadrons were stacked away from the sun on missions, groups were stacked in the opposite direction, making for a more compact wing box. Because the Eighth AF had only four B-17 units until May 1943, composite groups were formed by combining squadrons from different groups, or a fourth group was added to the wing box to form a diamond-shaped box. The latter was flown in a trailing position behind the wing and proved susceptible to Luftwaffe tactics of attacking the extremities of formations. The wing box was often spread vertically, deep, and across and was difficult to maintain. Berlin Germany 19 May 1944: B-17 Miss Donna Mae II (331st BS, 94th BG) was inadvertently bombed from above, breaking off the port horizontal stabilizer and causing a steep nose dive. The most serious disadvantage of the wing box was that the lowermost and uppermost elements, trailing at the end of the formation, had the least mutual protection. An additional risk was that of an aircraft being struck by falling bombs if it strayed in the box (see image): > \\"Directly below us (on 19 May 1944 to Berlin in B-17G 42-102411Miss Lace) in > the path of our falling bombs was a B-17 out of position. Later pictures > show a B-17 having his left stablizer shorn off by a five hundred-pound bomb > dropped from above. That plane went into a steep dive, out of control, and > was lost. As mentioned before, the bombs had to fall about five hundred feet > or more before the protective vane spun off to leave the bomb armed.\\" —303rd > BG pilot Richard Riley Johnson In the summer of 1943 the Eighth expanded in size to 16 groups of B-17s and 4 of B-24s, and by the following June would grow to 39 groups. The table of organization and equipment for heavy bombardment groups was increased from 35 to 62 planes with a huge influx of new bombers beginning in the autumn of 1943, and the use of composite groups was discontinued as many groups flew two group boxes on a single mission. The 54-plane wing combat box used by the Eighth's B-17s required both practice and discipline to maintain formation. Turbulence from leading bombers added to the difficulty of maintaining formation. The 54-plane box is capable of fielding upwards of 700 heavy calibre defensive machine guns in total to serve as a formidable defense against fighters, however. As flak became the greater threat in May 1944, the 36-plane box was resurrected in a much looser formation and became the standard through the remainder of the war except on days when significant fighter opposition was anticipated. Group combat box revisions In October 1943 the first radar-guided Pathfinder group began operations, bringing about a need for a compact 36-plane group formation to optimize bombing performance in adverse weather conditions. This was done initially by doubling the number of three-plane elements in a squadron formation from two to four, and placing all three planes within an element at the same altitude to avoid collisions. LeMay, who had been promoted to command of the 3rd Bomb Division, devised this diamond-shaped 12-plane combat box and preferred it over others, so that in August 1944 when he took command of Operation Matterhorn in India he adopted it as the basic formation for B-29 Superfortresses.\\"The Matterhorn Missions\\", John T. Correll, AIR FORCE Magazine, March 2009. A variation of the formation using four 9-plane squadrons in a diamond formation was developed to compress the bombing pattern further. Wing boxes followed each other in trail, and the formation was easier for escorts to protect. However, the close stagger of the four-squadron 36-plane was difficult to maintain, and increased the likelihood of a bomber flying at the bottom of the box being struck by bombs dropped from a higher plane. In visual bombing situations the revised 36-plane box eliminated the lowest squadron to lessen the possibility. Although the 36- and 27-bomber group combat box became standard for most of 1944, a diamond-shaped formation of four 10-plane squadrons was developed for B-24s of both the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Force. During the winter of 1944–45, minimizing losses to flak became a priority. The 27-plane box became standard for B-17s for all of 1945, spread more laterally to avoid catastrophic damage to the formation from a single shell burst. At the same time wingmen flew more forward on element leaders, creating a box that was stacked vertically, from front to back, and laterally. This final variation presented flak gunners with a small target, produced excellent bomb patterns, and was both easy to fly and control. B-24 combat boxes B-24s of the 2nd Air Division, more difficult than B-17s to fly in formation at high altitudes and with more restricted cockpit visibility, used a variation of the 27-plane group box. One element of each squadron (normally the uppermost in the middle/lead and high/right squadrons, and lowermost in the low/left squadron) was moved to the outside of the formation so that it was abreast of the trailing element. This produced a line formation that was wide and vertically, but only deep, reducing the time over target significantly. The 96th Combat Bomb Wing further refined the formation during its bomb runs by shifting the lead squadron into the highest position, the second squadron overlapping it in trail and lower, and the third squadron in file behind the second and another 150 feet lower. This produced devastatingly accurate bombing results in the last months of the war.  Fifteenth Air Force formations  B-24Ds fly through flak after hitting the Concordia Vega oil refinery in Ploiești, Romania, on 31 May 1944. The Fifteenth Air Force, consisting of a preponderance of B-24 groups flying at altitudes or lower than those flown by the B-17 groups in the Eighth Air Force, employed a larger group box during the period of December 1943 to July 1944. Called the \\"six-box formation\\", it consisted of forty aircraft, with the group divided into two units of twenty B-24s, one behind the other, and each unit consisted of three squadron boxes. The center squadron (known as Able Box) of the first unit was a composite formation of six aircraft containing the group leader, with the deputy leader flying on its wing. The other four aircraft of Able Box were from the two squadrons assigned to the unit for that mission, with the six bombers formed in two vee formations in trail and stepped lower in altitude. On each side of the lead squadron were seven-bomber boxes called Baker Box (to the right) and Charlie Box (to the left), each box made up of bombers of one squadron, also in vees of three, with one additional bomber flying in the slot of the center rear (sixth position) of each squadron box, and known as \\"Tail-end Charlie\\". This seventh position was usually flown by the least experienced crew in the squadron and was vulnerable to fighter attack, so perilous that it was commonly called the \\"coffin corner\\" or \\"Purple Heart corner\\". The second unit of the group formation was configured identically, except that its boxes were named Dog, Easy, and Fox. Each position within a box was numbered, so that the group leader flew the Able One position while the Tail-end Charlie of the leftmost rear squadron flew Fox Seven. The second unit flew at an altitude approximately lower than the first unit. Because it was laterally wide, the six-box formation was not a compact formation, was cumbersome to fly, and thus was less efficient in bombing accuracy. The Fifteenth Air Force adopted the diamond formation during the summer of 1944 to increase its bombing accuracy, but this also had the negative consequences of increasing losses to flak. This formation reduced the number of boxes from six to four, each flying three elements of three planes each with a Tail-end Charlie. As with the six-box formation, the trailing elements were stacked downward from the high leader, and the Tail-end Charlie of the fourth box (Dog Ten) was still often referred to as \\"the Purple Heart position\\". The four-box formation proved easier to assemble and organize, provided a tight bomb pattern, and concentrated defensive firepower against fighter attacks.

History The name is a sardonic reference to the DC Explosion, a 1978 marketing campaign in which DC touted its increasing number of titles and increased story pages in all of its titles, accompanied by higher cover prices. The Explosion itself lasted three months from its debut in comics cover-dated June 1978 until the revamp in comics cover-dated September 1978. Since the early 1970s, DC had seen its dominance of the market overtaken by Marvel Comics, partly because Marvel had significantly increased the number of titles that it published (both original material and reprint books). In large part, the DC Explosion was a plan to overtake Marvel by using its own strategy. DC's expansion actually began in earnest in 1975, when the company debuted 12 titles in the spring and summer, followed by four more titles by the end of the year. DC added 14 titles in 1976 and four more in 1977. However, DC experienced ongoing poor sales from the winter of 1977 to the winter of 1978. This has been attributed in part to the North American blizzards in 1977 and 1978, which both disrupted distribution and curtailed consumer purchases. Furthermore, the effects of ongoing economic inflation, recession, and increased paper and printing costs, led to declines in both the profitability of the entire comic book industry and the number of readers. In response, company executives ordered that titles with marginal sales and several new series that were still in development be cancelled. During these meetings, it was decided that DC's long-running flagship title Detective Comics was to be terminated with #480 — until the decision was overturned following strenuous arguments on behalf of saving the title within the DC office, and Detective was instead merged with the better-selling Batman Family. On June 22, 1978, DC Comics announced staff layoffs and the cancellation of approximately 40% of its line. Editors Al Milgrom and Larry Hama were two of the employees laid off. Cancelled titles As a result of the Implosion, 17 series were cancelled abruptly. Fourteen other titles were cancelled in 1978, for the most part \\"planned\\" cancellations announced in DC promos and in the final issues of the comics themselves. The following titles were cancelled due to the Implosion, with the following as their final issue: * All Star Comics #74 (Sept. cover date) — issue #75 later published in Adventure Comics #461 (Jan.-Feb. 1979) and 462 (March 1979); the feature continued there until #466 * Army at War #1 (Nov.) — war title * Batman Family #20 (Nov.) — merged into Detective Comics as of issue #481 (Dec. 1978-Jan. 1979) * Battle Classics #1 (Sept.) — reprint title * Black Lightning #11 (Sept.) — issue #12 later published in World's Finest Comics #260 (Dec. 1979-Jan. 1980) * Claw the Unconquered #12 (Aug.-Sept.) * Doorway To Nightmare #5 (Sept.) — merged into The Unexpected * Dynamic Classics #1 (Sept.) — reprint title * Firestorm #5 (Oct.) — issue #6 reworked into The Flash #294–296 (February-April 1981); the story was published in the trade paperback Firestorm: The Nuclear Man (2011) * House of Secrets #154 (Oct.-Nov.) — merged into The Unexpected * Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth #59 (Sept.-Oct.) — the \\"OMAC\\" back-up stories by Jim Starlin appeared in The Warlord #37-39 (Sept.-Nov. 1980) * Our Fighting Forces #181 (Sept.-Oct.) * Secrets of Haunted House #14 (Oct.-Nov.) — revived a year later with issue #15 (August 1979); the title continued until issue #46 (March 1982) * Showcase #104 (Sept.) — the Deadman story for #105 appeared in Adventure Comics #464 and the Creeper story for #106 appeared in The Creeper by Steve Ditko (2010) * Star Hunters #7 (Oct.-Nov.) - a planned Adam Strange back-up story later appeared in World's Finest #262 * Steel: The Indestructible Man #5 (Oct.-Nov.) — #6 story reworked for All-Star Squadron #8-9 (April-May 1982) * The Witching Hour #85 (Oct.) — merged into The Unexpected 1978 cancellations unrelated to the DC Implosion * Aquaman #63 (Aug.-Sept. cover date) — Cancellation announced March 1978.

Much of the unpublished work saw print in Cancelled Comic Cavalcade, a summer 1978 two-issue ashcan \\"series\\" which \\"published\\" the work in limited quantity solely to establish the company's copyright. The title was a play on DC's 1940s series Comic Cavalcade. Some of the material already produced for the cancelled publications was later used in other series. The two volumes, composed of some of these stories along with earlier inventoried stories, were printed by DC staff members in black-and-white on the office photocopier. A total of 35 copies of each volume were produced, and distributed to the creators of the material, the U.S. copyright office and the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide as proof of their existence. Considered a valued collectible, a set of both issues was valued as high as $3,680 in the 2011–2012 edition of the Comic Book Price Guide. The contents ranged from completed stories to incomplete artwork. The covers featured new illustrations; the first one showed the cancelled books' heroes lying either unconscious or dead on the ground, the second showed the cancelled heroes being kicked out of an office by a bespectacled man in a suit.

However, as the clan does not currently have a chief recognized by the Court of the Lord Lyon, it is therefore considered an armigerous clan. Variations of the surname are however considered septs of several other clans of the Scottish Highlands: The surname MacAndrews is considered a sept of the Clan Mackintosh and Clan Chattan, and also associated with the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry. The surnames Andrew and Andrews are considered septs of the Clan Ross. History Origins As Saint Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland the surname Anderson, which means Son of Andrew is commonly found throughout most of the country. The Scottish Gaelic derivation of the name is Gilleaindreas which means servant of Andrew. The Scottish historian, Ian Grimble, states that although arms were granted to an Anderson of that Ilk in the sixteenth century, as the name is so widespread no exact place of origin can be established. 16th and 17th centuries The historian George Fraser Black lists Andersons as being burgesses of Peebles as well as in the county of Dumfries. In 1585 John Anderson was a commissioner to Parliament for Cupar. Alexander Anderson was a famous mathematician who was born near Aberdeen and later settled in Paris, where he published works on Algebra and Geometry. Alexander's kinsman, David Anderson of Finshaugh, also a scientist, is renowned for removing a rock that was obstructing the entrance to Aberdeen harbour with the application of science and mechanics. 19th and 20th centuries In 1863 William Anderson published his famous biographical history of the people of Scotland, The Scottish Nation, in three volumes. In this book he praised the above-mentioned rock remover, David Anderson, stating that he had been rich enough and generous enough to found and endow a hospital in Aberdeen for the maintenance and education of ten poor orphans. In the 20th century the name is remembered for the famous Anderson shelters, a type of bomb shelter that was designed by John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley, during World War II. 21st century Anderson Clan Society The Clan Anderson Society was formed in 1973 and is active throughout North America. A clan room and archival display are maintained at Wyseby House in Kirtlebridge, Dumfriesshire. The Clan Anderson Society was Granted Letters Patent Clan Anderson Society Coat of Arms by Lyon Court in 2014 and Dr. Joseph Morrow Lord Lyon King of Arms presented the Letters Patent to the Clan Anderson Society at the Loch Norman Highland Games in North Carolina in April 2014. The Clan Anderson Society Coat of Arms depicts the more inclusive Clan Anderson motto WE STAND SURE . Cadet branches As the Clan has never been able to proclaim a Chief, there are no cadet branches for this clan. However, the major families have been identified as Anderson of Ardbrake & Westerton (whose crest is used by Andersons as a clansman's crest badge); Anderson of Kinneddar (scion of the Ardbrake line), Anderson of Noth, Anderson of Newbiggin & Kingask, Anderson of Dowhill & Stobcross, Anderson of Linkwood, Anderson of Inchyra & Stonyhill, Seton-Anderson of Mounie and Anderson of Candacraig. {style=\\"width:230px; height:350px\\" border=0\\" align=\\"right\\" |- !

Grange Fell is a small fell in the English Lake District in the county of Cumbria, situated in the Borrowdale valley overlooking the villages of Grange in Borrowdale and Rosthwaite. Topography The fell has a summit plateau which consist of many heather-covered hummocks, drystone walls and clumps of trees. Well-known Lake District writer Alfred Wainwright credits Grange Fell as a single fell with three main summits, namely Brund Fell, King's How and Ether Knott. The lesser known Ether Knott is now identified as the highest point at a height of 419 metres (1,375 feet) and is less frequently visited by walkers. Brund Fell is at 415 metres (1,363 feet) while King's How is the best viewpoint and has an altitude of 392 metres (1,286 feet). On the other hand, another Lakes walking expert Bill Birkett lists Brund Fell and King's How as separate fells in his “Complete Lakeland Fells” volume,Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): while Mark Richards includes all three.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): There are also two small hills on the fringes of the fell, both unfrequented although they lie on access land. Shepherds Crag above the more famous rockface of that name, adjacent to the Lodore Falls and Hotel, and Grange Crags above Grange. History Grange Fell is owned by the National Trust and was one of its first acquisitions in the Lake District in 1910; the fell was purchased by public subscription as a memorial to King Edward VII at the bequest of the King’s sister Princess Louise, who then was President of the Trust. The magnificent viewpoint of King's How was named after the King as a memorial, and a commemorative slate plaque is situated just below the summit. It reads: “In Loving Memory of King Edward VII, Grange Fell is dedicated by his sister Louise as a sanctuary of rest and peace. Here may all beings gather strength, find in scenes of beautiful nature a cause for gratitude and love to God, giving them courage and vigour to carry on his will.” Geology The geology of the fell is complex with outcropping of various members of the Birker Fell Formation (andesite lavas), the Eagle Crag Member (siltstone and sandstone conglomerates), and intrusions of dolerite.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Ascents Ascents of Grange Fell can be started from Rosthwaite, Grange in Borrowdale or Watendlath. The Rosthwaite to Watendlath bridleway can be utilised to its highest point before striking northerly to the summit of Brund Fell following a high dry stone wall for much of the way. The climb from Grange goes through the deciduous woodland at the foot of the fell and skirts round Greatend Crag before reaching King's How and is ranked as one of the \\"loveliest short walks in the Lake District\\". The two principal summits of Brund Fell and King's How should both be climbed by any visitor to the fell and they are linked by an undulating path through the hillocks. Summit The main summit bears a number of rock tors, protruding sharply from the heathery plateau. King's How has a steep sided domed top. Both bear cairns. The view from the top of the fell takes in Derwentwater with Skiddaw in the background, while Borrowdale and the high fells round its head show well in the opposite direction.

Overview A draft version of the text is circulated among participants who have a last opportunity to propose changes or amendments to the text. If no amendments are proposed (if no one 'breaks the silence') before the deadline of the procedure, the text is considered adopted by all participants. Often this procedure is the last step in adopting the text, after the basic premises of the text have been agreed upon in previous negotiations. 'Breaking the silence' is only a last resort in case a participant still has fundamental problems with parts of the text and is therefore the exception rather than the rule. In the context of international organisations, the subject of the procedure is often a joint statement or a procedural document, a formal vote on which with the members meeting in person is deemed unnecessary. Indeed, it is often impractical to try to stage a meeting between representatives of all member states either due to the limited importance of the text to be agreed upon or due to time constraints in the case of a joint declaration prompted by recent events. Organisations making extensive use of the procedure are, among others, the European Union, NATO and the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe (OSCE).

The city of Gisborne in New Zealand is named after him. Early life Gisborne was born in 1825. He was the third son of Thomas John Gisborne (1789–1868) of Holme Hall, near Bakewell in Derbyshire, England. His mother was Sarah Gisborne (née Krehmer). His grandfather was Thomas Gisborne (1758–1846), who fought for the abolition of the slave trade in England. Thomas Gisborne the Younger (1790–1852) was an uncle who represented various constituencies in the House of Commons between 1830 and 1852. His eldest sister, Mary, married William Evans, who would later be made a baronet. William Gisborne emigrated to Australia in 1842 and to New Zealand in 1847. He was initially secretary to Edward John Eyre, the lieutenant governor of New Munster Province. He was then appointed commissioner of Crown lands, a role for which he moved to New Zealand's capital, Auckland. Gisborne returned to England for 1852 and 1853. Afterwards, he held various roles as a civil servant. He resigned from the civil service in 1869. Gisborne married Caroline Gertrude Bridgen at St Mary's Church in the Auckland suburb of Parnell, and the couple had four children (one son, three daughters). Political career The reason for Gisborne's resignation from the civil service was for him to be able to take on the role of Colonial Secretary in the third Fox Ministry. He was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council on 2 July 1869, and resigned on 11 January 1871. A week later, he was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in the 1871 general election for the Egmont electorate. He resigned on 10 September 1872. In December 1875, Gisborne was a strong candidate for the Wellington mayoralty, but he fell out with the public over him favouring denominational education. In addition, he then announced himself as a candidate for the 1875 general election in the electorate, and that triggered a concerted effort to find a suitable mayoral opponent. When Gisborne lost the mayoral election against William Hutchison, he withdraw from the general election. Gisborne then represented the Totara electorate from a , following the death of George Henry Tribe. He was re-elected at the and served until the end of that term of Parliament in 1881. Later life He returned to England in 1881 following the death of his elder brother Francis. In 1892 he inherited Allestree Hall from his brother-in-law, Sir William Evans, 1st Baronet, and died there in 1898. His wife died in 1908. In 1870, the city of Gisborne in New Zealand was named after him. The township of Gisborne in Victoria, Australia, was named after Henry Fyshe Gisborne, who was a cousin of William Gisborne.

Bates official biography Notable rulings * On August 3, 2018 Judge Bates ruled that \\"the Trump administration did not justify its decision to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA\\" and ordered DACA to be reinstated. He gave the administration 20 days to appeal. * On April 24, 2018, Judge Bates ruled that the Trump administration must resume accepting new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) but stayed his decision for 90 days to allow the Department of Homeland Security to explain why DACA was being canceled. * On January 23, 2017, Judge Bates blocked the $37 billion merger between health insurance companies Aetna and Humana, saying the deal would hurt competition and raise prices for consumers. * On October 25, 2016, Judge Bates dismissed freed Guantanamo Bay detention camp prisoner Shawali Khan's petition for habeas corpus as moot. Khan had opposed the dismissal, arguing that, because his detention had never been declared illegal, his past as a U.S. prisoner was preventing him from getting medical treatment for injuries suffered during his imprisonment. While dismissing Khan's lawsuit, Bates wrote he was nevertheless \\"sympathetic to the pickle\\". * On March 19, 2014, Judge Bates in Innovator Enterprises, Inc v Jones found for the plaintiff and vacated BATFE's classification of the company's \\"stabilizer brake\\" as a \\"firearm silencer\\".Innovator Enterprises Inc v Jones, Courtlistener.com, March 10, 2014. > Hypotheticals further illustrate the weakness of this methodology.

Bates noted that the NSA had been violating provisions of various laws, but nevertheless decided to allow the government to continue many aspects of the mass surveillance program. Critics of encroaching U.S. security state policies, in a nod to the Bates numbering method used in the legal field, appropriated the \\"Bates stamp\\" moniker as a neologism to refer to often uncritical FISC scrutiny of U.S. government conduct when considering Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) applications. * On December 10, 2010, Bates dismissed a challenge to President Barack Obama's targeted killing order against Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, a dual American and Yemeni citizen with ties to al-Qaeda. Bates ruled that al-Awlaki's father, Nasser al-Awlaki, who filed the suit with assistance by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, lacked legal standing in the case against the Obama Administration. Bates stopped short of granting the executive branch \\"unreviewable authority\\" to order the killing of an American citizen, instead concluding that the case would likely be settled in another forum outside the courtroom.Suit Over Targeted Killings Is Thrown Out, The New York Times, December 7, 2010. * On July 31, 2008, Bates ruled, in a dispute between the Administrative and Legislative branches, that President George W.

Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby and former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage. Plame's lawyers had said from the beginning of the lawsuit that it would be quite difficult to win, since public officials and servants are generally immune from such suits filed in connection with their jobs. Plame's identity as a Central Intelligence Agency field operative was revealed in a syndicated newspaper column in 2003. This revelation coincided with (Plame's husband) Wilson's criticism of the Bush administration's policy in Iraq. Many of the administration's opponents questioned the timing of the leak of Plame's identity, and assign blame of the leak to officials in the administration. Although several administration officials were questioned in an investigation of the leak, no formal charges were brought, and Libby was then found guilty of lying and obstruction of the investigation as a consequence of his lying. President George W. Bush subsequently commuted Libby's jail sentence as unduly harsh. In April 2018, President Donald Trump fully pardoned Libby. *Bates stated in his ruling that the couple's allegations \\"pose important questions relating to the propriety of actions undertaken by our highest government officials,\\" but that he had to dismiss their claims for jurisdictional reasons. While saying the Bush administration officials' actions \\"may have been highly unsavory\\", Bates nonetheless ruled \\"there can be no serious dispute\\" that speaking to the press to rebut Wilson's criticism was \\"within the scope of defendants' duties as high-level Executive Branch officials.\\" The Wilsons appealed. * In a December 30, 2002 decision, Bates of the U.S. District Court ruled that lead plaintiff Representative Dennis Kucinich and 31 other members of the United States House of Representatives have no standing to challenge President Bush's withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty without congressional approval.

Biography Gruen was born in Berlin in 1923, and emigrated to the United States as a child in 1936 when his parents, James and Rosa Gruen, fled Germany to save their lives.Biography, 2008 edition During the journey, Gruen celebrated his Bar Mitzvah in the Great Synagogue of Warsaw, on June 6, 1936. He studied at the City College of New York. Then, after completing his graduate studies in psychology at New York University, he trained in psychoanalysis under Theodor Reik at one of the first psychoanalytic training centers for psychologists, the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis in New York City. Gruen held many teaching posts, including seventeen years as professor of psychology at Rutgers University. From 1979 on, he lived and practiced in Switzerland. Widely published in German, his groundbreaking first book to be released in English, The Betrayal of the Self, was published by Grove Press in 1988. Gruen's place in the history of psychology can be summarized as follows. According to Sigmund Freud, human beings are born with an innate tendency to destruction and violence; throughout his scholarly and clinical career, Prof. Gruen challenged that assumption, arguing instead that at the root of evil lies self-hatred, a rage originating in a self-betrayal that begins in childhood, when autonomy is surrendered in exchange for the \\"love\\" of those who wield power over us. To share in that subjugating power, people create a false self, a pleasing-to-others image of themselves that springs from a powerful, deep-seated fear of being hurt, humiliated or abandoned. Gruen traced this pattern of over-adaptation, and the fate of those who resist the pressure to conform, through a number of case studies, sociological phenomena—from Nazism to Reaganomics—and literary works. The insanity of rage and numbness that this hyper-conformity produces, unfortunately, goes widely unrecognized precisely because it has become the cold, tough \\"realism\\" that modern society inculcates into its members and even admires. Gruen warned, however, that escape from these patterns lies not simply in rebellion, for rebels often remain emotionally tied to the objects of their rebellion, but in the development of a personal autonomy and a relinquishing of all forms of self-numbing and self-deception. His elegant and far-reaching conclusion, elaborated in the books and essays listed below, is that while autonomy and authenticity are not easily attained, their absence proves catastrophic to both the individual and society as the embittered conformists seek new victims on whom to wreak violence and avenge their psychic wounds. In 2001, Gruen was awarded the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for his work, Der Fremde in uns.

History Seeon Abbey was founded in 994 by the Bavarian Pfalzgraf Aribo I, a member of the Aribonid dynasty, and settled by Benedictine monks from St. Emmeram's Abbey in Regensburg. The monastery is on an island in the lake Seeoner See, part of the present-day municipality of Seeon-Seebruck. The abbey soon developed a significant scriptorium, producing manuscripts not only for the abbey's own use but also for other monasteries and churches. Their most important client was Emperor Henry II, who presented many volumes to the Bishopric of Bamberg, which he had founded in 1007. Toward the end of the 11th century the abbey church was re-built in the Romanesque style, but this building stood for only 100 years or so, before in about 1180 it was replaced by the present church, terminating in the east with an apse. More alterations in the late Gothic style were carried out between 1428 and 1433 by Konrad Pürkhel of Burghausen. The Romanesque basilica was given a vaulted ceiling and a new choir. In 1579 the church was decorated with unusual Renaissance frescoes, showing, alongside scenes from the life of Christ and the Virgin Mary, the patrons, Saints Benedict and Lambert, and the founders, Aribo and Adala. Also of special note is the red marble gravestone of Abbot Honorat Kolb and the gravestones of the abbots of the 15th and 16th centuries lined up against the walls of the castle chapel. In the middle stands the tomb of the founder, Count Aribo I, made by Hans Heider in about 1400. The restored cloisters are also worth seeing. The original of the Madonna and Child (or the Seeoner Muttergottes, created in 1433 by the \\"Master of Seeon\\", as the anonymous artist is known) is considered one of the most beautiful representations of the subject. Since 1855 it has been in the Bavarian National Museum in Munich, but a copy has stood since 1947 on the high altar of the present parish church. The sacristy at Seeon contains a far older Madonna of about 1380. Engraving from \\"Topographia Germaniae des Matthaeus Merian\\", about 1644 The church originally had only one tower, that is, the north one, built to the model of that at Frauenchiemsee. The second tower was added at the end of the 12th century. The Romanesque towers are reminiscent of Freising Cathedral and, like the Frauenkirche at Munich, have copper \\"onion towers\\", which were added after a fire in 1561. Between 1657 and 1670 the church was extended by the construction of a sacristy in the Lady Chapel, an oratory and a crypt beneath the chapel of Saint Barbara. Until the secularisation of Bavaria in 1803 Seeon was a place of learning and culture: Joseph Haydn was a guest here, and Mozart was active here between 1767 and 1769. After 1803 the abbey was dissolved and the buildings were turned into a castle, and used later at various times as a medicinal spa, convalescent home and barracks. The infirmary and the library were demolished, and a causeway constructed connecting the island to the mainland. In 1989 the premises were eventually acquired by the government of the administrative region of Oberbayern and after a lengthy restoration reopened in 1993 as a cultural and educational centre, which is now used for concerts, exhibitions, seminars, conferences and workshops. Since 2017, the Christian Social Union's group in the German Parliament has been holding its annual retreat at Seeon Abbey.

The book, set in 1990s Calcutta and New York City at some unspecified time in the future, is a medical thriller that dramatizes the adventures of people who are brought together by a mysterious turn of events. The book is loosely based on the life and times of Sir Ronald Ross, the Nobel Prize–winning scientist who achieved a breakthrough in malaria research in 1898. The novel was the recipient of the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1997. Ghosh employs a factual background for the invented events in the novel, drawing upon Ross' Memoirs which were published in 1923. Plot summary The novel begins with the story of Antar, a resident of the future New York doing data processing for the International Water Council. A chance bit of data causes Antar to recall a bizarre encounter he had with L. Murugan, an employee of the LifeWatch organization (Antar's former employer), who disappeared in Calcutta in 1995. Murugan had asked to be transferred to Calcutta because of his fascination with the life of Sir Ronald Ross. While Antar tries to track Murugan’s movements in Calcutta through the digitized archives, another narrative thread follows Murugan directly as his path brings him into contact with a variety of other characters, some more savory than others. The plot is quite complex and its timelines are deliberately mixed up, switching from Antar's time to Murugan's to Ross' and back over the course of as many chapters. Through his research into old and lost documents and phone messages, Antar determines that Murugan had systematically unearthed a deep secret lurking behind Ross' malaria research — an underground scientific and mystical movement that could grant eternal life. Loosely described, the process of securing this form of immortality is as follows: the disciples of this movement can transfer their chromosomes into another's body, and gradually become that person or take over that person. In the novel, Ronald Ross did not discover the mysteries of the malaria parasite; it was a group of underground practitioners of a different, mystical \\"science,\\" natives of India, who helped to guide Ross to the conclusions for which he is famous. These native Indians provided Ross with clues in the belief that in the moment Ross made his discovery, the parasite would change its nature. At this point, a new variant of malaria would emerge and the group's research using the chromosome-transfer technique would advance even further. Themes Silence is a recurring theme in the novel, originating from the often-stated premise that to say something is to change it. Huttunen notes that the workings of the Indian scientific/mystical movement uncovered by Murugan \\"constitutes a counter- science to Western scientific discourse\\" (25). The tenets of the group contain aspects of the Hindu belief in the transmigration of souls as well as of contemporary scientific ideas about genetics and cloning (Huttunen 27). Its native Indian members operate through means kept secret from the more Westernized characters and from the reader, and their activities become progressively clearer as the novel continues until their plan is revealed to the reader. Huttunen explains that the methodology of this group is based on the ideas of Emmanuel Levinas about communication by way of silence. In Levinas' view, \\"the other exists outside the traditional ontology of Western philosophy which conceives of all being as objects that can be internalized by consciousness or grasped by adequate representation ... Consequently silence in this novel represents the kind of unattainable experience that transcends the level of language, or knowing\\" (30-31). It is this enigma that the novel leaves behind as an abiding theme. The reader is forced to keep thinking about it much after turning the last page. The mystery at the heart of the story is never completely resolved by the author, leaving much to the reader's understanding and interpretation. Characters *Antar - A man in the future who is about to retire. He is investigating the disappearance of Murugan. *Murugan - He calls himself Morgan from time to time. He lives in the 1990s and is an authority on Sir Ronald Ross. Much of the novel is about his tracking the life of Ronald Ross. *Ronald Ross - The Nobel Prize–winning scientist who found out that malaria is spread through mosquitoes. Much of his research is spoken about. He conducted his experiments on a man called 'Lutchman.' His tale is narrated by Murugan. *Lutchman - He once lived at Renupur station. His family and whole village had been wiped out by a strange epidemic. He was later picked up by Ross for his experiments and did everything for him. He claimed he was a 'dhooley bearer' or a cleaner. Later in the novel it is revealed that his name was actually 'Laakhan' and he changed his name at every village to sound like a local. *Mangala - Cleaning woman at Doctor Cunningham's laboratory, but that's her disguise, she is in reality a Demi God who not only discovered the means of treating syphilis with the Malaria parasite but also found a form of asexual reproduction/reincarnation for humans which kept her and Lutchman alive forever. *Sonali - A writer for Calcutta Magazine, a journalist, and actor who, it is suggested in the novel, transforms herself with the help of Mangala's \\"science\\" *Urmila - A journalist for the same publication as Sonali, she is the one Mangala chooses for her transformation or reincarnation. *Romen Haldar - Lutchman in his most recent reincarnation.

Overview The word burlak originated from Tatar word bujdak, 'homeless'. According to another version the word originated from old middle-German bûrlach (working team with fixed rules, artel). Burlaks appeared in Russia at the end of 16th century and beginning of the 17th century. With the expansion of freight-hauling, the number of burlaks increased. The chief of a burlak gang was called Vodoliv (), next in line was the Dyadya (, captain), followed by the Shishka (, first in the line of haulers), while the last in line was called Kosny (, last in the line of haulers). There were seasonal burlaks, who worked from spring to autumn, and temporary burlaks, who worked occasionally. Burlaks did not work in winter, when most Russian rivers were frozen over. The main areas of the burlaks' trade in the Russian Empire were the Volga river, from Moscow to Astrakhan, the White Sea route (Belomor’e), from Moscow to Arkhangelsk, and the Dnieper river, in Ukraine. Most burlaks were landless or poor peasants from Simbirsk, Saratov, Samara, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Vladimir, Ryazan, Tambov and Penza areas. Burlaks joined up in an artel (typically from four to six, sometimes ten to forty, and occasionally up 150 people) mainly in winter, despite that at this time clients paid the lowest price, because in winter burlaks were often otherwise unemployed. The final payments were in autumn, after finishing work. With the coming of the Industrial revolution, the number of burlaks declined: in the beginning of the nineteenth century about 600,000 burlaks worked on the Volga and Oka rivers; in the middle of nineteenth century, 150,000, and by the beginning of the twentieth burlaks had all but disappeared. The burlak was a subject of Russian songs (, famously performed by Feodor Chaliapin, The Volga Boatmen's Song etc.), and artwork (Burlaks on the Volga by Ilya Yefimovich Repin).

It was her only credited role, though she was credited not as Terry but as Toto. She was owned and trained by Carl Spitz. Life and career Terry as Rex with Virginia Weidler in Bad Little Angel (1939) Terry, born in the midst of the Great Depression, was trained and owned by Carl Spitz. Her first film appearance was in Ready for Love (1934) which was released on November 30, 1934, roughly one month before her first major film appearance, with Shirley Temple, in Bright Eyes (1934) as Rags. She did her own stunts, and almost lost her life during the filming of The Wizard of Oz (1939), when one of the Winkie guards accidentally stepped on her foot, breaking it. She spent two weeks recuperating at Judy Garland's residence, and Garland developed a close attachment to her. Garland wanted to adopt her, but Spitz refused. Her salary, $125 per week (), was more than that of many human actors in the film, and also more than most working Americans at the time. She attended the premiere of The Wizard of Oz at Grauman's Chinese Theater; because of the popularity of the film, her name was changed to Toto in 1942. She had 16 total film appearances, three of which were playing in theaters at the same time in the fall of 1939: The Wizard of Oz, The Women, and Bad Little Angel. Among the last ones was Tortilla Flat (1942), in which she was reunited with Oz director Victor Fleming and Frank Morgan, who played the Wizard. Terry was the mother of Rommy, another movie Cairn terrier, who appeared in other films including Reap the Wild Wind (1942) and Air Force (1943).

The station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting and broadcasts on 100.7 MHz at 50 kW ERP from a tower site in Philipstown, New York, and has studios on Route 52 in Beacon, New York with other radio stations. History In early 1957, Highland Broadcasting, owner of WLNA, began petitioning the Federal Communications CommissionFederal Communications Commission Docket Number 12032, April 23, 1957 to grant a class B FM allocation to the City of Peekskill, New York. In the petition, Highland noted that there were no class B FM allotments between Poughkeepsie and New York City, that the far flung northern suburbs were rather heavily populated, not all of the area was covered by FM signals, and it was culturally unique from New York City. Initially, it was thought that 106.7 MHz would fit in with the stations already licensed to New York City. However, by March 1957 that frequency had already been applied for by the Riverside Church in New York City. After some frequency shuffling between the cities of New Haven, Connecticut and Waterbury, Connecticut, 100.7 MHz was allotted to Peekskill, New York on May 24, 1957.Notice of Proposed Rule Making FCC 57-538, May 24, 1957 WLNA-FM signed on for the first time on October 24, 1958 as the second FM station between New York City and Albany, New York. The format was a 100% simulcast of WLNA. During this time, the FM station's main source of revenue was a Muzak Subcarrier.Subcarrier authorization, FCC form 318, September 12, 1959 The first major changes to the station occurred in late 1971. On October 14, 1971, the call sign was changed to WHUD.Authorization/license change telegram, from FCC to Highland Broadcasting, December 24, 1971 In December 1971, WHUD increased its power from 20 KW to 50 KW ERP.Construction Permit WLNA-FM 100.7 MHz Peekskill, New York Federal Communications Commission File number BPH-6827, October 31, 1969 In February 1972, the simulcast with WLNA ended, WHUD began broadcasting in Stereo, and launched a beautiful music format. The Bonneville format consisted largely of instrumental covers of pop songs with some vocal standards. Some adult contemporary artists were mixed into the music rotation with one vocal track per 15 minutes under the work of Program Director (and morning personality) Joe O'Brien. Prior to his work at WHUD, O'Brien was one of the WMCA Good Guys and had been doing mornings on the New York City station since the early 60s. During this early period, WHUD branded its format as Music From the Terrace, a term named for the location of WHUD's studios on Radio Terrace, () a public street in the town of Cortlandt, New York. In 1982, Highland Broadcasting sold WHUD and WLNA to Radio Terrace, Inc. The format remained unchanged, however, more resources were diverted away from WLNA in favor of WHUD as AM radio began to decline. In 1986, Joe O'Brien retired and was replaced by longtime New York City radio personality Ed Baer. Baer spent a total of 18 years broadcasting in the New York City market, also as one of the WMCA good guys then on country station WHN and later on WYNY He stayed in the morning show position until he retired for the second time in 2000. Ed Baer was replaced by longtime news director Mike Bennett who got his start at Hudson Valley radio station WHVW in the early 1970s. 1986 was also the year that WHUD began to equal out the vocal/instrumental ratio to the point that by early 1990 it was an even split. However, the declining demographics and audience of the beautiful music format led WHUD to eliminate instrumental covers with little fanfare, evolving into a soft adult contemporary format. Throughout the first half of the 1990s, WHUD would continue evolving to a wide play list adult contemporary format. In 1997, WHUD was sold to Albany, New York based Pamal Broadcasting. The studios were moved from Radio Terrace to the newly reconstructed \\"Broadcast Center\\" on NY Route 52, in the town of Fishkill, New York. Programming After the ownership transfer, Pamal altered the format with a slight recurrent lean to the play list and the addition of the Delilah show in evening time slot in spite of the same program being cleared on the Poughkeepsie-based WRNQ. This geographic loophole also led to the stations sharing a jingle package for several years. Regardless, WHUD dropped Delilah in September 2006 and replaced her with a live and local evening program called Night Rhythms hosted by Catherine Michaels (the program would resurface on WLTW two months later and continues to air there although in a localized format). Indian Point warning Siren at WHUD transmitter site WHUD serves as the primary (LP-1) Emergency Alert System (EAS) station for Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, and Orange Counties. As such it is the first media outlet in the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant public warning system. Prior to the studio move to Fishkill, New York these duties fell to WABC (AM) in New York City because WHUD's studio was located within the 10 mile Emergency Planning Zone around the Indian Point Energy Center. In July 2007 Pamal spent approximately $500,000 to upgrade WHUD's transmitter site and add redundancies to its technical facility to ensure that the station could meet its public warning responsibilities. WHUD's signal reaches most of the Hudson Valley and the suburbs of New York City with a usable signal in much of the Five Boroughs (especially in the Bronx). In total, WHUD's signal reaches parts of five states. The primary target market of WHUD is that of Westchester and Rockland Counties plus the Mid-Hudson Valley. In all of these areas, WHUD is at or near the top of the ratings even with more localized competition in those markets and is by far the highest rated Westchester County station in Nielsen's New York City book.

Since 1 November 2011, it is part of the town Braunlage. It is situated in the Harz, approximately 7 km west of Braunlage proper, and 20 km east of Osterode am Harz.  History  Sankt Andreasberg was founded in the 1480s. It was first mentioned in a letter from the Count Heinrich zu Stolberg to Dietrich von Witzlebenon on 3 November 1487. The establishment of the village took place around the market. The first silver mines are assumed to be the St. Andrews Cross Mine () at the foot of the Beerberg and the St. Andrews Mine (Grube St. Andreas) by the market. In 1521, St. Andreasberg received the right to mine from Counts Heinrich and Ernst von Hohenstein. It was proclaimed in Mansfelder Land and in the mining areas of Saxony and miners were invited to dig for silver and other metals.  Natural monuments  Granite blocks: the Dreibrodesteine The area around Sankt Andreasberg is especially rich in habitats worthy of protection in within the Harz National Park, but also around the town in the form of Upper Harz mountain meadows. In the national park north-northwest of Sankt Andreasberg are the Dreibrodesteine (at ca. ;Harzer Wandernadel: Stempelstelle 154 – Dreibrodestein auf harzer- wandernadel.de ; ND GS 43), three outsize blocks of granite that have been formed by spheroidal weathering. According to legend they originated as the three loaves of bread of a heartless woman who would not help a starving miner. With the words (\\"I'd rather my three loaves became stones\\") she spurned the miner, whereupon the loaves grew into giant stones and squashed the woman into the mossy earth. The granite blocks were considered a warning against heartlessness. At the Dreibrodesteine is checkpoint no. 154 (Dreibrodestein) in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking system and a memorial to the foresters and officials of the Andreasberg Forestry Office who fell in the two world wars. Other natural monuments are a group of chestnuts on the market square (ND GS 42) and the diabase deposit in the village of Silberhütte (ND GS 45). Johann Wolfgang von Goethe researched in 1783 the Hohe Klippen rocks (ND GS 146) on the Rehberg mountain above the present-day Goethe Place on the Rehberger Graben ditche, because he believed he would find evidence there for his assumptions about the earth's history. The boundary between the geological platform made of greywacke hornfels and the underlying fine-grained Brocken granite runs by the Hohe Klippen.  Religion  The population of Sankt Andreasberg is mostly Protestant.  Sport  As a result of their elevation, Sankt Andreasberg (520–720 m) and Sonnenberg (800–850 m) still have fairly guaranteed snow. Sankt Andreasberg is an Alpine Ski Centre of the Harz, with three T-bar lifts on the Sonnenberg as well as two double chair lifts and three T-bars at the Matthias Schmidt Mountain Centre. In the Teichtal there is the first snowtubing track in the Harz. The cross-country skiing trail network around Sankt Andreasberg has 40 km of tracks and is linked from the Sonnenberg to Oderbrück/Torfhaus and to the Ackerloipe/Altenau networks. On Matthias Schmidt Mountain a Sommerrodelbahn is open during the summer. Nordic Walking, hiking, mountain biking and trekking are popular summer activities in the peaceful surroundings of the Sankt Andreasberg mountain town. In the spa park there is a ropes course and climbing park. The southern part of the Oderteich reservoir in the Harz National Park is open to swimmers in the summer. Coming from Torfhaus and Oderteich, the Brocken bypass section of the nearly 100 km long Harzer Hexenstieg hiking trail passes through the town and heads for Braunlage and Thale. Mountain rescue services are provided by the local Harz Mountain Rescue Club. Several Sankt Andreasberg sports clubs enjoy a long tradition. These include the Sankt Andreasberg Shooting Club (1522) and the Sankt Andreasberg Gymnastics and Sports Club (1861). Following the success of the 1st Winterfest in 1896 the Upper Harz Ski Club was founded on the Brocken; it is now called the St. Andreasberg Ski Club 1896.

Despite proving itself a practical proposition the Birch Gun was never highly regarded by the British High Command, apparently not for any particular defect or lack of capability but an entrenched belief that such an innovation was unprecedented and so at best unwelcome and at worst an expensive and unnecessary indulgence.J.B.A. Bailey Field Artillery and Firepower, Oxford, 1989, , p. 156 Named after General Sir Noel Birch, who was Master General of Ordnance at the time, the Birch gun comprised a Vickers Medium Mark II tank chassis originally fitted with a QF 18-pounder (83.8 mm) gun. This remained the armament in all the models, although the latest version, usually called the Mk III, had limited elevation. Birch Guns were used in the Experimental Mechanized Force manoeuvres of 1928 but by 1931 they had been removed from service and political pressure was applied to prevent any plans to complete the third version of this weapon. It would be a decade before the British Army returned to the concept of tracked artillery, in the middle years of a war for national survival where speed and mobility on the battlefield were not optional and eleven years before it would once again be equipped with a similarly effective weapon. Armament The armament for the original Birch Gun consisted of an Ordnance QF 18 pounder field gun (3.3 inch, 84 mm). The mounting and sighting arrangements varied in the various versions but the gun remained the same. Powerplant The Armstrong Siddeley engine was only moderately powerful by later standards, an 8-cylinder 90 horse power unit which gave a maximum speed of 28 mph/45 km/h, however, by comparison with tracked armour of the era – the Medium Mark A Whippet 'cavalry tank' of World War I was twenty miles per hour slower – it was considered more than adequate and had twice the Whippet's range. Variants The initial prototype, the Mark I, made its first appearance in January 1925 and spent the next year undergoing trials and taking part in manoeuvres, mainly with 28 Battery, 9th Field Brigade, Royal Artillery. The lone Mark I was transferred to 20 Battery, 9th Field Brigade RA, who then took delivery of three Mark II Birch Guns in July 1926, followed by a fourth gun in September. Improvements included changes to the gun and (very complex) sighting equipment: the top-mounted recuperator was moved below the barrel and a gun shield provided for crew protection. In all five vehicles the gun was pintle-mounted towards the front of the vehicle and had a 360 degree traverse and a maximum elevation of almost 90 degrees, allowing them to be used as anti-aircraft artillery. The five guns participated in field exercises, as part of the Experimental Mechanized Force and it successor, the Experimental Armoured Force, which was disbanded in February 1929. Tank advocate and theorist B. H. Liddell Hart subsequently argued the EMF's operations were always too small in scope, were exclusively confined to that of an adjunct to larger, traditionally organised force of the kind whose limitations had been so cruelly exposed in the Great War. In effect he asserted the exercises had been designed to avoid any hint that mechanised forces could operate independently or be strategically decisive. Whether or not that accusation was well-founded one shortcoming highlighted by the exercises was that infantry lorries (and by extension, towed artillery) could not keep up with the tanks cross-country. The solution, that of providing the infantry with tracked or half-tracked armoured personnel carriers (the route taken by France and Germany) was deemed far too expensive and effectively dismissed. It was against this largely negative background that the Experimental Armoured Force was disbanded, leaving the British Army that pioneered the use of armoured formations to form ad hoc armoured forces, employing tank brigades and motorized infantry brigades that acted independently and thus did not practice integrated arms warfare, a habit so ingrained that it survived well into World War II. With the withdrawal from service of five Birch guns in June–July 1931 ended not only the British Army's promising experiments with tracked self-propelled artillery ended (unintelligible) but any attempt to integrate infantry, guns and tracks until the hurriedly improvised vehicles were rushed into British service during the Second World War, notably the Bishop and the Deacon, then learning afresh how to best employ them. Not only had lessons learned in the 1920s been squandered, so had the opportunity to perfect the operational use of highly mobile armoured forces working in collaboration with similarly mobile and well-protected infantry. When these lessons had to be re-learned (or those who refused to learn them replaced) the British army could once again make proper use of such weapons systems while pitted against a well-equipped, forward- looking, fast-moving and aggressive adversary for whose military leaders the British experiments and advocates of mechanised warfare had been inspirational. If 'exotic' weapons like the Birch gun were dismissed as something between a fad and a threat to the established order of the peacetime army seems foolish in hindsight (unintelligible) perhaps it is understandable in the context of an army - and in a nation - that had just fought \\"the war to end all wars\\" for four long years, in the processes losing a million killed, two million injured and ended the war exhausted and on the verge of bankruptcy. If the general public were uninterested, wishing only to forgetting the horrors of trench warfare, the higher echelons of the army seemed to be determined to downplay the role of any and all innovations in breaking the stalemate on the Western Front. It was therefore surprising two Mark III Birch Guns were produced but they were never issued to serving units. Unlike the previous marks these featured revolving barbettes that increased protection for the gun crew at the cost of severely limiting the guns' elevation, preventing use against aircraft or to provide long-range fire, limiting them to short-range, direct fire. It is arguable that if the Mk I Birch gun was the first self-propelled tracked artillery piece then the Mk III Birch Gun was the world's first assault gun but neither weapon - nor category of weapon - would find a role in British service until after similar vehicles were encountered in combat decades after the same weapons had been firmly set aside. Use The Birch gun was tested as part of the Experimental Mechanized Force in the 1920s. The Force undertook various experiments in mechanized warfare combining tanks and infantry with their own motorised transport. The composition of the force was: * reconnaissance group with tankettes and armoured cars * battalion of 48 Vickers medium tanks * motorised machine gun battalion * mechanised artillery regiment, Birch guns forming one battery * motorised field engineer company References Bibliography  External links * Self-Propelled Field and Medium Guns Category:Self- propelled artillery of the United Kingdom Category:85 mm artillery Category:Abandoned military projects of the United Kingdom ","title":"Birch gun"},{"id":"4510130","text":"Himat may refer to: *Bradley BA-300 Himat, a proposed American aircraft design *Rockwell HiMAT, an experimental American aircraft design ","title":"Himat"},{"id":"4510137","text":"Vienenburg is a borough of Goslar, capital of the Goslar district, in Lower Saxony, Germany. The former independent municipality was incorporated in Goslar on 1 January 2014. Geography It is situated in the north of the Harz mountain range and east of the Harly Forest on the Oker River near its confluence with the Radau, about northeast of the Goslar town centre. Neighbouring municipalities are Bad Harzburg in the south and Schladen-Werla in the north. The former township consisted of Vienenburg proper and the surrounding villages Immenrode, Lengde, Weddingen, Lochtum and Wiedelah, all incorporated in 1972. Situated in a mainly agricultural area, it is known for the Harzer cheese, although the production was transferred to Saxony in 2004. History The Harlyberg hill (256m/840 ft) north of the town was the site of a castle built in 1203 by the Welf king Otto IV of Germany to threaten the trade route to Goslar, as its citizens supported his Hohenstaufen rival Duke Philip of Swabia. After Otto's death in 1218 the castle became a property of the Welf Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg and a thorn in the side of the Bishops of Hildesheim, while the garrisons of the castle were notorious for permanently robbing bypassing merchants. Therefore, Prince-bishop Siegfried II of Hildesheim declared war against Duke Henry I of Brunswick and in 1291 took and slighted the castle. Some moats are still visible today. A modern observation tower stands nearby. A second castle up de Viene was first mentioned in a 1306 deed. It was erected by the Counts of Wernigerode, then at the behest of the Hildesheim prince-bishops, who purchased it in 1367. After the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud, the castle was occupied by Duke Henry V of Brunswick- Wolfenbüttel. During the Thirty Years' War, it was conquered by the Imperial troops of Albrecht von Wallenstein in 1626. The estates were restored to the Bishopric of Hildesheim in 1647. The adjacent settlement remained part of the episcopal lands until the 1803 German mediatization and fell to the newly established Kingdom of Hanover in 1814. Vienenburg received town privileges in 1935. Part of the Prussian Province of Hanover since 1866, it was incorporated into the Free State of Brunswick in 1941. Wöltingerode Abbey Wöltingerode In 1174 the Counts of Wohldenberg established a Benedictine monastery at their ancestral seat west of Vienenburg, which converted into a Cistercian nunnery a few years later, confirmed by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1188 and by Pope Honorius III in a 1216 deed. The abbey affiliated to the Bishopric of Hildesheim generated several filial monasteries and left a collection of notable manuscripts, now kept at the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel. In 1523 the Prince-bishop of Hildesheim had to cede Wöltingerode to Duke Henry the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel as a result of the Great Diocesan Feud. Henry's son Duke Julius turned Protestant in 1568 and in consequence a Lutheran abbess was installed as head of the monastery. During the Thirty Years' War the Hildesheim Prince-bishop Ferdinand of Bavaria, backed by the Catholic League and his Wittelsbach relatives, took the occasion to regain the lost territories. Referring to the 1629 Edict of Restitution issued by Emperor Ferdinand II, he had the nuns expelled and put the abbey under Jesuit rule. Nevertheless, in 1632 the Catholic canons again had to abscond from the approaching Swedish army and Wöltingerode, though it finally fell back to the Hildesheim Bishopric in 1643, remained Lutheran until the 1803 secularisation. Today Wöltingerode is known for its abbey church, a Romanesque basilica of the late 12th century with an attached cloister and a crypt, which serves for storage of the Wöltingerode Korn, distilled here since 1682.

Transport  Railway station Vienenburg's railway station, opened in 1840 on the Brunswick–Bad Harzburg railway of the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway, is the oldest preserved one in Germany and a regional railway hub. From Vienenburg, railway lines run in four directions: north to Brunswick, southeast to Halberstadt–Halle, south to Bad Harzburg and southwest to Oker–Goslar. The old goods line to Langelsheim was a victim of the division of Germany and was never reactivated. Vienenburg lies on the B 82 (link to the A 7 Hannover/Kassel) and 241 (Goslar) federal highways as well as the B 82 (link to the A 2; Brunswick, Berlin/Dortmund) and the B 6/B 6n (links to the A 14 Halle/Leipzig−Magdeburg and to Goslar and Bad Harzburg).

A painter who has also used collage, sculpture, photography, cinema and lithography, he is associated with the French artistic movement of the 1960s and 1970s called Figuration Narrative (new figurative representation), somewhat like pop art. Fromanger has also been associated with photorealism. Fromanger studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where his first solo exhibition was held in 1966. Souffles, his large translucent \\"half-balloon\\" street sculptures, attracted attention in 1968. He also collaborated with Jean-Luc Godard to make the short \\"Film-tract 1968\\". Urban life and the consumer society are themes well represented in his work. The Nouvelle Figuration movement (sometimes called figuration narrative or représentation narrative) is considered to have been a reaction against abstract art, with a more political slant than American pop art. Fromanger has been described as a social critic who takes a political position without neglecting the poetic dimension. Michel Foucault, a friend of Fromanger's, wrote about his work in Photogenic Painting. In 2005 a retrospective exhibition, Gérard Fromanger: rétrospective 1962-2005, was shown at various galleries in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland.

Gravity Probe B A magnetometer determines the orientation of the generated field, which is interpolated to determine the axis of rotation. Gyroscopes of this type can be extremely accurate and stable. For example, those used in the Gravity Probe B experiment measured changes in gyroscope spin axis orientation to better than 0.5 milliarcseconds (1.4 degrees) over a one-year period.Einstein.stanford.edu This is equivalent to an angular separation the width of a human hair viewed from 32 kilometers (20 miles) away. The GP-B gyro consists of a nearly-perfect spherical rotating mass made of fused quartz, which provides a dielectric support for a thin layer of niobium superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme rotational symmetry, lack of friction, and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.Einstein.stanford.edu A sensitive DC SQUID magnetometer able to discriminate changes as small as one quantum, or about 2 Wb, is used to monitor the gyroscope. A precession, or tilt, in the orientation of the rotor causes the London moment magnetic field to shift relative to the housing. The moving field passes through a superconducting pickup loop fixed to the housing, inducing a small electric current. The current produces a voltage across a shunt resistance, which is resolved to spherical coordinates by a microprocessor. The system is designed to minimize Lorentz torque on the rotor.Einstein.stanford.edu Magnetic field strength The magnetic field strength associated with a rotating superconductor is given by: :B=-\\\\frac{2M }{Q}\\\\ \\\\omega where M and Q are the mass and the charge of the superconducting charge carriers respectively. For the case of Cooper pairs of electrons, M=2me and Q=2e. Despite the electrons existing in a strongly-interacting environment, me denotes here the mass of the bare electrons (as in vacuum), and not e.g. the effective mass of conducting electrons of the normal phase.

It is sometimes, incorrectly, referred to as the Gepard, which may lead to confusion with the unrelated Flakpanzer Gepard. Design and development The Flakpanzer 38(t) was designed around the chassis of the LT-38, a pre-war Czech design, which following the German occupation was produced for the Wehrmacht as the Panzer 38(t) until it was no longer effective.

Subtypes Upper gastrointestinal Upper gastrointestinal surgery, often referred to as upper GI surgery, refers to a practise of surgery that focuses on the upper parts of the gastrointestinal tract. There are many operations relevant to the upper gastrointestinal tract that are best done only by those who keep constant practise, owing to their complexity. Consequently, a general surgeon may specialise in 'upper GI' by attempting to maintain currency in those skills. Upper GI surgeons would have an interest in, and may exclusively perform, the following operations: * Pancreaticoduodenectomy * Esophagectomy * Liver resection Lower gastrointestinal Lower gastrointestinal surgery includes colorectal surgery as well as surgery of the small intestine. Academically, it refers to a sub-specialisation of medical practise whereby a general surgeon focuses on the lower gastrointestinal tract. In the U.S., a student wanting to specialize and practice in adult lower GI surgery would generally have to go through four years of undergraduate college pre-medical education and get a bachelor's degree, then finish the four years of medical school, then finish a typically five-year-long residency in general surgery, and then perform a subsequent one-year-long (minimum) residency in surgery of the small intestine or large intestine (the colon- specifically, the cecum, the vermiform appendix, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the hepatic flexure and the splenic flexure, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon; and also the rectum and the anus). A fellowship (in surgery of the small intestine or of the large bowel, or in pediatric/neonatal lower GI surgery, or in surgery of congenital abnormalities or rare disorders of the lower GI tract, or in emergency/trauma surgery or in cancer surgery of the area), would add on approximately one to three more years.http://www.mayo.edu/mayo-clinic-school- of-graduate-medical-education/residencies-fellowships/surgery- specialties/colon-and-rectal-surgery-residency-minnesota A lower GI surgeon might specialise in the following operations: * Colectomy * Low or ultralow resections for rectal cancer, etc. References Category:General surgery ","title":"Digestive system surgery"},{"id":"4510254","text":"Yang Fu ( 210s–230s), courtesy name Yishan, was an official of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He previously served as a regional official in Liang Province during the late Eastern Han dynasty. In the 210s, when the warlord Ma Chao rebelled against the Han central government, occupied Liang Province by force and murdered some of the provincial officials, Yang Fu and his colleagues pretended to submit to Ma Chao. Later, they plotted a revolt against him and succeeded in forcing him out of Liang Province. During the reign of the second Wei emperor Cao Rui, Yang Fu proposed to the emperor to scale down his extravagant construction projects but the emperor ignored him. Early life Yang Fu was from Ji County (冀縣; or Jicheng 冀城), Tianshui Commandery (), which is around present- day Gangu County, Gansu. He served as a minor official in the local commandery office in his youth. Once, when the military officers in his home commandery sought his opinion on who would win the battle of Guandu, he replied that \\"Lord Yuan (Yuan Shao) is lenient but indecisive, foxy but inconclusive; people won't be afraid of his might since he is indecisive, and he'll let opportunities slip by since he is inconclusive. Even he may be powerful now, he won't achieve anything great in the end. On the other hand, Lord Cao (Cao Cao) has ambition and vision, and he is able to make decisions without hesitation. His army is disciplined and strong, his officers come from a diverse range of backgrounds and are hardworking, so his forces will win.\\"(袁公宽而不断，好谋而少决；不断则无威，少决则失后事，今虽强，终不能成大业。曹公有雄才远略，决机无疑，法一而兵精，能用度外之人，所任各尽其力，必能济大事者也。) Sanguozhi vol. 25. His prediction turned out to be accurate and he became famous throughout Liang Province for his foresight and brilliance. Later, Wei Kang, the Inspector of Liang Province, recruited him to be an Attendant Officer. Struggle for Liang Province In 211, a coalition of warlords from the west of Hangu Pass started a rebellion against the Han central government, which was under the control of the warlord Cao Cao. Cao Cao led his forces to fight the warlords at the Battle of Tong Pass and defeated them. Ma Chao, one of the leading warlords in the coalition, managed to escape to the territory of the Qiang and Hu tribes to recuperate. Cao Cao pressed on his attacks against the remnants of the coalition and pursued Ma Chao to Anding Commandery, but pulled back his forces after hearing about unrest in his territories in the east. During this time, Yang Fu warned Cao Cao, \\"Ma Chao has the courage of Ying Bu and Han Xin, and he has the support of the Qiang and Hu tribes. If you order the army to retreat now and don't make enough preparations here, we'll forfeit the commanderies in the area.\\"Sanguozhi vol. 25. Cao Cao applauded Yang Fu's proposal but could not adopt it because he had to deal with Su Bo's rebellion in Hejian Commandery and Sun Quan's attack on Ruxu. In 213, as soon as Cao Cao and his army left Liang Province, as Yang Fu foresaw, Ma Chao attacked the commanderies in Liang Province with support from Zhang Lu, a warlord in Hanzhong Commandery. Ma Chao soon besieged Ji County, the last stronghold in Liang Province which remained under Han control. Despite Yang Fu's valiant efforts to resist the enemy, Ji County still fell to Ma Chao, and Yang Fu was forced to submit to Ma Chao. Disgruntled by Ma Chao's cruelty and treachery (including his murder of Wei Kang, the Inspector of Liang Province), Yang Fu and other officials in Liang Province secretly hatched a plot to drive Ma Chao out of Liang Province. Yang Fu lied to Ma Chao that he wanted to see to the funeral arrangements for his recently deceased wife and gained permission to leave Ji County. He then used the opportunity to contact the other officials and prepare for their revolt against Ma Chao. In September 213, Yang Fu started a rebellion against Ma Chao in Lu County to lure Ma Chao to lead his troops out of Ji County to attack him. In the meantime, while Ma Chao was away, the other officials in Ji County responded to Yang Fu's call and killed Ma Chao's wife and child(ren), who were in Ji County. Ma Chao was unable to retake Lu County so he retreated back to Ji County, only to find his family dead and the city gates shut. He then led his remaining forces to attack Li County, where some of Yang Fu's relatives and the families of the officials who rebelled against him were, and killed them in revenge. During the battles against Ma Chao, Yang Fu sustained five wounds over his body and lost seven relatives. Ma Chao eventually gave up on Liang Province and fled to Hanzhong Commandery to join the warlord Zhang Lu. Service under Cao Rui Yang Fu continued serving in the Cao Wei state, founded by Cao Cao's son and successor Cao Pi, after the end of the Han dynasty in 220. He lived through the reigns of the first two Wei emperors, Cao Pi and Cao Rui, and was enfeoffed as a Secondary Marquis. In 230, the Wei general Cao Zhen led an army to invade Wei's rival state Shu, but the advancement was thwarted by heavy rainfall, which lasted for more than a month and rendered the mountainous paths untraversable. Yang Fu, along with others, advised Cao Rui to order Cao Zhen to withdraw the Wei troops. Later, when Cao Rui started on his extravagant construction projects and expansion of his imperial harem, Yang Fu repeatedly advised the emperor against such actions. However, Cao Rui ignored his advice. Yang Fu then sought permission to resign from his position as Minister Steward, but was denied. Since then, Cao Rui applauded Yang Fu for his suggestions but seldom acted on them. Yang Fu died in an unknown year without much family property. He was succeeded by his grandson, Yang Bao (), presumably because his son(s) died early. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Shabla municipality includes the following villages: Bojanovo, Chernomortsi, Durankulak, Ezerets, Gorichane, Gorun, Granichar, Krapets, Prolez, Smin, Staevtsi, Tvarditsa, Tyulenovo, Vaklino and Zahari Stoyanovo. As of December 2009, the town itself had a population of 3,586 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009 It is situated on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast in the vicinity of the salt-water Lake Shabla and Bulgaria's easternmost point, Cape Shabla. Shabla has an extensive white sand beach and was a popular destination for Eastern Bloc tourism until the fall of Communism. The beach itself is located some 5 km from the town (shuttle service in summer) via a road constructed under the EU Phare programme On the main town beach there is a large car park and many old bungalows next to a large restaurant that serves today's tourists in the summer months. The beaches, and generally the seaside in the municipality, are famous for the untouched nature and virgin beaches. Another route leads you to the coastal road and past Shabla's lighthouse which is the tallest, oldest and easternmost one on the Bulgarian coast. Set among the ruins of the 4th-century fortress, it was built in its modern appearance during the Crimean War and opened on 15 July 1856, though it is in fact a reconstructed older lighthouse built between 1756 and 1786.http://stalker.dir.bg/1982.doc Its tower is 28.23 m-tall. The next village along this route and moving South is Tyulenovo and the start of the rocky coast and high cliffs that stretch through Kamen Bryag to the small bay of Kavarna. Shabla in antiquity was an ancient Thracian settlement founded 6th-5th century BC and known by the Greek name of Karon Limen (Carian Bay) that grew into a Black Sea port in Roman times. The town flourished in the early years of the Byzantine Empire, a fortress still being preserved from the period (4th century). During Ottoman rule it was known as Karamanly Climate  History   Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic  According to the mayor of the city, the oldest technologically advanced gold in the world was discovered near him, preceding by five hundred years the major finds from the Varna Chalcolithic necropolis. Prehistoric settlements conventionally called Shabla I and Shabla II, synchronous with the durankulak, were discovered and explored in 1974 by Prof. Henrieta Todorova in the New Vineyards area, east of the present town between the Shabla Tuzla and Shabla Lake sites. Their inhabitants maintained relations with the population living in the south along the Black Sea coast.  Ancient Caria  In ancient times, the Thracian tribe of the Gethites inhabited these places, the area being part of the Odrisian kingdom. Numerous Thracian tombstones rise in the vicinity and bear witness to this era. Ancient Thracian settlement from the 6th-5th centuries BC, which grew at the end of the 2nd century BC. in a port city, it was discovered near the present-day Kariya fishing village on Cape Shabla. The port city of Caria in the bay south of Cape Shabla is identified with the ancient \\"Portus Karia (Port Caria) / Καρών Λιμένα (Karon Limen)\\" - the Port of Karate and was the most important transit port in the VI-V century. BC. to the 6th century AD. - Ancient Thracian Korea 1100 years providing the way through the Thracian Chersonesos (Bosphorus) to the mouth of the Danube and Pantikapei (Crimea), turned into a fortress by the Romans, last reconstructed in the IV century during the early Byzantine era. It is evidenced by Arian, the Anonymous Periplus of the Black Sea, and the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela in his work \\"Geography\\" in the middle of the 1st century AD, indicating that it is located between Kalatis (today Mangalia) and Tristis (Kaliakra). at Shabla's nose. Ever since then, the Cape has been an important navigation landmark along the west coast of the Euxine Pont. A \\"fire watch\\" was maintained here, and in Roman times a tower with constant fire. This is confirmed by the divers found on the seabed by divers to the northeast of the present headlamp columns and a stylized cuckoo head made of marble. The findings from the excavations are stored in the museum in Dobrich and in the House of Culture in the city. Given the meaning of the word \\"Portus / Limen\\", it can be assumed that the ancient port of Cape Shabla was artificially created. According to Karel Shkorpil, it was a rectangular basin, 280 m long and 120 m wide, bordered on the north, east and south by three stone breakwaters, in the middle of which there was one entrance. Modern underwater studies have specified the plan of the ancient port - it consisted of two parts: the first - a relatively shallow pool of approximately 400/150 m, surrounded by north and east reefs, which in their present form successfully fulfill the role of natural breakwater, which is almost identical to that described by Karel Shkorpil ancient harbor and second part - a deeper bay, located just south of the basin. Old descriptions of the Cape Shabla area mention that the reefs were once overlooked by an artificial construction, which refers to the Thracian facility precisely to the Limen category, the existence of which is confirmed in the Caron Limen toponym itself. According to Arian, \\"the land around the Port of Kari is called Karia.\\" Looking at the vast and relatively low coastal terrace located west of the ancient port, much of which is occupied with the remains of the said vast settlement and its necropolises. This clarifies that Caria is not an abstract geographical concept, but a specific place name, representing the ancient name of the Thracian coastal settlement, and Caron Limen being the name of its port. The entire nose area of about 25 hectares is littered with archeological monuments. Although the coastline today is different from that of antiquity, the accidental finds, terrain crawls, excavations carried out in 1976 - 1979, and underwater surveys in 1962,1979 and 1980 undoubtedly confirmed the existence of this site in the Chronicles described as significantly antique. settlement. The antique fort, located on the very head, just south of the Shabla lighthouse, is well researched. The preserved part of the fort is 12 x 60 m in size. The western part of the northern fort wall was studied from the outside and face in 1978–79. It is almost 2 m thick; preserved altitude 1.80 m. Through the 1995-96 drilling, archaeological excavations revealed the route of the western fortress wall and partially explored the southwestern tower. The site has been declared a cultural monument by letter No 4267 / 23.12.1985 from the National Research Institute. A flooded settlement of the Bronze Age, an ancient necropolis, ancient remains of boats made only with wooden assemblies and a few medieval wrecks were fixed under water opposite the Shabla Tuzla. The Antarctic Peninsula Peak is named after the ancient Caria. = Middle Ages and Modernity = In the early Middle Ages, the area devastated by the barbarian invasions was populated by the Bulgarians and Slavs, and since the founding of the Bulgarian state was part of it. After the failure of Vladislav Varnenchik's crusade against the Turks in 1444, Ottoman domination was fully established there. During the Middle Ages, ivory ships passed by the shores of Shabla. Many of them are swallowed up by the waves, and to this day it happens that the greatest lucky ones find elephant tusks thrown from the water. The legend tells of the British ship \\"Black Prince\\" sunk by Shabla during the Crimean War, loaded with gold for the army. The origin of the present name of the settlement, according to the version, is related to the Proto-Bulgarian word \\"saber\\" (scoop). In the middle of the 19th century Shabla is the largest Bulgarian village in the region and its mayor is Bulgarian. Residents actively participate in the struggle for an independent Bulgarian church, education and national freedom. In the personal notebook of Hristo Botev when forming his company was recorded Nikola Alexov from Shabla. After the liberation from Ottoman rule, Shabla became the center of the municipality. Pride for her is the gold medal won by Dimitar Anastasov, who won the First Bulgarian Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition in Plovdiv in 1892. In 1900, a rural revolt broke out in Durankulak and Shabla against the introduction of new taxes (a dozen). From August 1913 to September 1916 and from November 1919 to September 1940, the area was occupied by Romania. After the liberation on September 7, 1940, hundreds of families deported from the Romanian authorities from the native Bulgarian population of Northern Dobrudzha settled here. Around the Shabla lighthouse was the only oil field in Bulgaria, hot mineral water with high sulfur content is flowing from many drilling operations today. Until 1964 Shabla was a village, until 1969 a town of urban type, on 27.08.1969 was proclaimed a city.

Life Little information about Fei Yao is recorded in history; unlike other notable figures of the late Eastern Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period, he does not have a biography in the 3rd- century text Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), the authoritative source for the history of that period. Information about him is found in parts of the biographies of other persons. The first mention of Fei Yao was in 220, the year when the Cao Wei state was established and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period.Zizhi Tongjian vol. 69. He joined the Wei general Cao Zhen in suppressing a rebellion by Zhang Jin (張進) in Jiuquan Commandery (酒泉郡; around present-day Jiuquan, Gansu). In late 221, when the tribal leader Zhiyuanduo (治元多) started a rebellion in Liang Province (covering parts of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu), Fei Yao joined Zou Qi (鄒岐), Zhang Ji, Xiahou Ru (夏侯儒) and others in suppressing the rebellion. In early 229, when Wei's rival state Shu Han sent an army to invade the Wei fortress at Chencang (陳倉; east of present- day Baoji, Shaanxi), Cao Zhen ordered Fei Yao to lead troops to reinforce Hao Zhao, the Wei general defending Chencang, but Hao Zhao held his ground and the Shu invaders retreated when Fei Yao showed up. In 230, Fei Yao was promoted to the position of General of the Rear (後將軍). In the same year, the Shu regent Zhuge Liang, along with the Shu generals Wei Yan, Wu Yi and others, led Shu forces to attack Wei territories in Liang Province. Fei Yao and another Wei general, Guo Huai, engaged enemy forces under Wei Yan at Yangxi (陽溪), but were defeated and driven back. Around March 231, Zhuge Liang led Shu forces to attack Wei again, leading to the Battle of Mount Qi. At the time, the Wei general Sima Yi was in charge of military affairs in Liang and Yong provinces. Sima Yi, with Zhang He, Fei Yao, Guo Huai, Dai Ling (戴陵) and others as his subordinates, led the Wei forces to resist the enemy. In April 231, Sima Yi sent Fei Yao and Dai Ling with 4,000 troops to defend Shanggui County (上邽縣; in present-day Tianshui, Gansu) while he led the remaining troops to attack the enemy at Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu). Zhuge Liang led a detachment to attack Shanggui County while leaving the rest of his army to attack Mount Qi. Zhuge Liang and his troops defeated Guo Huai, Fei Yao and others and collected the harvest in Shanggui County. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Fei Yao appears as a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, he is one of Cao Zhen's subordinates and he participates in the defence of Wei territory during the second Shu invasion. He falls into an ambush set by Jiang Wei which is meant for Cao Zhen and commits suicide after being surrounded by the enemy.

History Football begin being played in Banja Luka before World War I. During the period between the two world wars, Banja Luka was the seat of one of the national subassociations of the Football Association of Yugoslavia, the Banja Luka football subassociation. Football popularity grew, main city club Krajišnik managed qualification to the 1935–36 Yugoslav Football Championship, so officials deemed the current facilities inadequate. A new stadium with better conditions for playing and bigger capacity was built in the place where the main club in the city, SK Krajišnik, had its field. The architect of a new stadium was Žarko Malić. The stadium was officially inaugurated on 5 September 1937, with its first official name \\"Stadium of Bogoljub Kujundžić\\" in honor of Kujundžić, one of the main donators of the stadium, and the ban of the Vrbas Banovina. At the inauguration day, two games were played. The first, as warm- up, was between Hajduk Banja Luka against Meteor Krupa, and then the main game, between SK Krajišnik against the guests who were the Yugoslav champions that year, BSK Belgrade.Stadion at FK Borac Banja Luka official website, retrieved 23 July 2018 Besides football, the stadium was until WWII also used for the back then much popular Sokol society sports events.ZAPISI IZ ARHIVA: Stasavanje banjalučkog sporta (4): Veliko rivalstvo Krajišnika i Balkana at Glas Srpske, 24 April 2017, reytrieved 23 July 2018 After the World War II, SK Krajišnik was disbanded by the new authorities, and the stadium received its present name, the Banja Luka City Stadium and FK Borac Banja Luka became its main tenant. Later, when Bosnian War started, the stadium was elected by the newly formed Football Association of Republika Srpska to become the national stadium of the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska and was the place where on December 20, 1992, the first, and only, match with the characters of a national team of the Republika Srpska official football team, was played. It was against the team representing the Republic of Serbian Krajina, and the final result was a 1:1 draw. North stand of the Banja Luka City Stadium under construction during 2012. The highest attendance on the stadium was recorded in 1989 when there was 30,000 people. The stadium underwent several expansions and reconstructions in the year 1973 and 1981, 2010 and 2012. The first match under reflectors was played on 11 October, in 1973. The east stand, where the most loyal fans, the Lešinari), are located, was built in 1981. In 2010, the stadium underwent complete reconstruction. New seats were installed, locker rooms were renovated, a completely new VIP lounge and media room was built, new lighting, sound systems and video surveillance were installed, and trophy as well technical rooms were renovated. In 2012, new north stand was built with a capacity of 2,492 seats, which increased the total capacity of stadium finally to 9,730. Today, the stadium meets UEFA demands for spectators comfort and security and it has separate section for guest fans. In its history, it has hosted numerous international matches at a senior level, athletes meetings, concerts of famous regional and worldwide stars and other manifestations. According to recent plans, the east stand will be covered by roof in upcoming years. In the near future, the construction of the south stand will begin, which would increase the total capacity to approximately 13,000 seats.

It is from the early Cretaceous Period. Discovery and naming Known elements of the holotype Two specimens of a troodontid were described in 2002. They are both housed in the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, under the specimen numbers IVPP V 12615 and IVPP V 12583. Xu Xing, Mark Norell, and colleagues authored the study describing them, finding the specimens to represent a new taxon, for which was chosen the binomial Sinovenator changii. The generic name was derived from the Latin word Sinae, for China, and Venator, or \\"hunter\\". Meemann Chang is honoured by the species name for her contributions to the study of the Jehol Fauna. As Chang is a female researcher, the epithet should have been \\"changae\\"; however, such mistakes cannot be emended according to the rules of the ICZN and therefore forms such as \\"Sinovenator changae\\" or \\"Sinovenator changiae\\" that sometimes appear in the literature, are incorrect. The type specimen or holotype of Sinovenator changii is IVPP 12615, a partial skull and disarticulated skeleton. An additional specimen was by the original publication scientifically described and assigned as the paratype of the species: an incomplete but articulated postcranial skeleton, numbered IVPP 12583. A third specimen was referred: IVPP V14322, a fragmentary skeleton. All three are in the collection of the IVPP in Beijing, China. However, Sinovenator fossils appear to be common in the Lujiatun Beds. In a 2006 survey of the Jehol Biota, Xu and Norell reported that hundreds of undescribed specimens are known. The fossils have been preserved three-dimensionally, not strongly compressed on a slab. In 2014, the wrist of one specimen was described, IVPP V14009, an adult.Xing Xu, Fenglu Han & Qi Zhao, 2014, \\"Homologies and homeotic transformation of the theropod ‘semilunate’ carpal\\", Scientific Reports 4, Article number: 6042 Doi:10.1038/srep06042 In 2018, PMOL-AD00102, consisting of a partial skull and mandibles, and six cervical vertebrae, was referred to the taxon. Description Size of Sinovenator compared to a human Sinovenator is a troodontid, a group of small, bird-like, gracile maniraptorans. All troodontids have many unique features of the skull, such as closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw, and large numbers of teeth. Troodontids have sickle- claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian encephalization quotients, meaning they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses. The holotype individual of Sinovenator was about the size of a chicken, less than a metre long. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the weight of a one metre long individual at 2.5 kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 140 However, the holotype and paratype are subadults; specimens are known with about twice their length. This makes it one of the larger species of troodontids in the ecosystem of the Yixian Formation, the formation where it was found. In the original description some distinguishing traits or autapomorphies were established. The front edge of the antorbital fenestra, the large skull opening in front of the eye socket, is straight and vertically oriented. The frontal bone shows a vertical ridge touching the lacrimal bone. The surangular in the lower jaw has a T-shaped cross-section. The shinbone has a vertical ridge on the upper outer side, the crista cnemialis, touching a lower vertical ridge, the crista fibularis. Photo and CT scan of skull PMOL-AD00102 There is a number of other notable traits. The upper branch of the praemaxilla excludes the maxilla from the nostril. The premaxillary teeth lack denticles; those on the maxillary teeth are small. The maxillary tooth row is positioned at some distance from the jaw rim. A fenestra promaxillaris is present. The branch of the jugal towards the postorbital is long, slender and inclined to the rear. The foramen magnum is much larger than the occipital condyle. The braincase lacks a recessus suboticus and a crista otosphenoidalis. The rear of the pterygoid has a secondary, rod-like, process. The front dentary teeth are closely packed. The rear of the surangular is extraordinarily deep. Five sacrals are present, those of the middle being clearly larger. The ilium is relatively small. The ischium is bird-like: small with a low obturator process and processes on the upper and lower rear edge. The shinbone is wide at the top and has a roughly rectangular lower joint surface. The fourth metatarsal is not strongly developed but the second metatarsal is small. The third metatarsal is pinched at the top but still visible at the upper front of the metatarsus, conforming to the subarctometatarsal condition. Phylogeny Specimen IVPP V14322 Details of specimen BMNHC Ph798, the skull is partially covered by fibula and tibia. In 2002 Sinovenator was placed in the Troodontidae. Sinovenator is a basal or \\"primitive\\" troodontid, and shares features with the most basal dromaeosaurids and Avialae. It thus was one of the first fossil specimens conclusively demonstrating the close relation of these three groups in the overarching Paraves. A typical basal trait is the orientation of the pubic bone to the rear, similar to the situation in the Dromaeosauridae and basal birds. This proves that the orientation to the front with later troodontids, is a reversal and not a trait directly inherited from older theropods that also possess a forward pointing pubic bone. Another basal character is the lack of a bulla, a swollen region on the underside of the braincase. This indicates that the similar bulla with the Ornithomimosauria presents a case of parallel evolution and is not a proof for a Bullatosauria, an earlier presumed close relationship between troodontids and ornithomimosaurs. Originally, the basal position of Sinovenator seemed to be corroborated by a very high age, the fossils being assumed to date from the Hauterivian. Later research however, indicated that the layers were younger. In 2017, a study by Shen et al., describing the genus Daliansaurus found Sinovenator to form a monophyletic group with other troodontids from the Yixian Formation, named Sinovenatorinae. A wide, flattened fourth metatarsal was found to be a synapomorphy uniting this group. The study recovered the following cladogram: A 2018 study by Yin et al. instead found the Chinese troodontids to form an intermediate grade: See also * Timeline of troodontid research References Category:Early Cretaceous dinosaurs of Asia Category:Troodontids Category:Fossil taxa described in 2002 Category:Taxa named by Xu Xing Category:Yixian fauna ","title":"Sinovenator"},{"id":"4510362","text":"Bovenden is a municipality in the district of Göttingen, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

S. 293-298, Population development The population of the main village Bovenden has increased ever since the second half of the 20th century: History The village of Bovenden is first mentioned in a deed by Otto I from February 2, 949, in which the future emperor certifies a barter with Hersfeld Abbey. In this first designation the toponym was Bobbenzunon. In the following years the village was also referred to as Bobbantun (1141), Bobentun (1170), and Bobentum (1191). Since the 13th century the name Boventen was commonly used and since the end of the 16th century today's designation Bovenden was introduced. The origin of the town name is contended. One derivation is the combination of the personal name Bovo or Bob(b)o with the suffix -tun. The suffix -tun is Low German and means \\"fence, confinement, or fenced area\\". Consequently, the name might refer to a settlement founded or governed by Bobo. Another interpretation is that the stem of the name is derived from bioðan (=„above“, cf. Low German boven), referring to the contrained settlement above the flood plain of the Leine. In the 12th century the aristocratic family of the \\"Herren von Bovenden\\" makes its first appearance. They are mentioned in a document in 1170 for the first time. In this document, which contains information about bestowals in the area around Bovenden to the Abbey Helmershausen, Bobo of Bovenden is mentioned as one of the witnesses. Starting in 1211 the \\"Herren von Bovenden\\" appear as the patrons of the local chapel. In the following decades the family of Bovenden succeeded in enlarging their property. Bovenden remained nevertheless the main village, in which seven farms, eleven and a half hooves of land, two meadows and the castle were included. The family of Bovenden appeared as Burgmanns at the Hardenberg, served as Mainzians, and were often witnesses at the Hardenbergers, a noble family of Lower Saxony. Despite the vicinity to the Electorate of Mainz the family of Bovenden also took feudal tenures from the House of Welf. In the 14th century the family of Bovenden sided mainly with the family of Braunschweig, for example in 1364 Knight Günther of Bovenden promised Duke Otto to help him with everything except the archbishop of Mainz. And in case Duke Otto managed to free him of the alliance with the Electorate of Mainz Knight Günther would serve only Duke Otto. The influence of the family of Boventen on the history of the area was significant for two centuries until the end of the 14th century. Only the line of Lenglern continued the name after 1500. The possessions of the Herren of Bovenden, which are referred to as nobiles and miles in documents, were transferred to the noble men of Plesse. Today, the key in Bovenden's emblem indicates the relationship to the Electorate of Mainz as Burgmans at the Hardenberg. The Herren of Bovenden are the most significant landowners in Bovenden since the 14th century. They gave their whole estate to Landgrave Louis I of Hesse in 1447 and received the estate again as a feudal tenure.Heinz Ahlborn, Ulrich Scheuermann: Beiträge zur Geschichte Elliehausens (Stadt Göttingen). Heft 1: Die Edelherren von Plesse als Grundherren in Elliehausen. Sonderdruck aus Plesse-Archiv 28, Bovenden 1992, S. 243 Through this measure the Herren of Bovenden were able to obtain a higher degree of home rule in front of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. After the line of Plesse ended in 1571 the rule was transferred to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel and the area turned into a Hesse enclave. Since the 16th century Bovenden received more rights as a consequence of being the most important location of the reign of the Plesse family. These rights included that Bovenden was designated a \\"Flecken\\" since 1587 which showed that the area has a market right and since 1605 Bovenden was also bestowed with brewing right. After Plesse Castle was abandoned in 1660, Bovenden turned into the administrative center. Starting in 1777, a new representative baroque building replaced two former Meierhofs of the Steina Abbey. The representative and administrative tasks were executed in this Hesse castle until 1815. The building further served as the hunting lodge of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Rotenburg. The location of the enclave provided various professions with special development possibilities. Due to the founding of the University of Göttingen in 1737 Bovenden experienced an economic boost in the second half of the 18th century. Many students came to Hesse-Kassel enclave to watch traveling theater groups, eat in the tavern \\"Zum letzten Heller\\" as well as to drive to the tavern in Rauschenwasser. It was also popular to purchase wine, spirits, coffee, and sugar there as these goods were burdened with luxury taxes in Göttingen. As these activities were regarded as a waste of time and incurring debts by the students, the authorities of Göttingen University came up with the term \\"Dangers of Bovenden.\\" In the context of a local government transformation in Germany in 1973 the eight villages of the area were merged to become the municipality of Bovenden.

As of 2002, predominantly due to UEFA requirements, the club proposed an extensive renovation of the stadium. Throughout the first stages of redevelopment all seating low capacity stands were erected behind the goals to comply with UEFA rules. Following years, as the expansion continued, extra rows of seats were added and both stands were fully covered. Since the 2012-13 season, the away supporters have been housed on one side of the North Stand, historically the Kop stand attended solely by the home fans. This decision has triggered a huge discontent among the home supporters, with many of them boycotting to attend home games as a sign of protest. Currently the stadium consists of four separate stands. The West and East Stands run alongside the pitch, with West Stand considered to be the main stand equipped with VIP seats, hospitality boxes and press room, TV commentators seats as well as section for wheelchair users.

It was refurbished in 2011 with new glass in the platform canopies, resurfaced platforms, passenger information screens, improved disabled access to the barrow crossing, a full repaint and a new footbridge to replace the original which was superannuated. The refurbishment of the platforms retained their original size and means that previous plans to extend these by up to by no later than 2012 did not go ahead to the original timescale. Services A CrossCountry operating to Birmingham From Melton Mowbray there is an hourly service off-peak in both directions operated by CrossCountry. Westbound, trains run to Birmingham via , and Coleshill. Eastbound, trains run to via , Ely and . Additional trains run at peak times, with some terminating at Cambridge. Although the next station westbound is , there are no direct services between the two stations. Despite managing the station, East Midlands Railway (EMR) only operates a limited number of services to the station. A single daily return service to London St Pancras commenced on 27 April 2009 running via Corby and is notable for being the first regular passenger service to cross the spectacular and historic Welland Viaduct on the Oakham to Kettering line since 1966. The company introduced a further return service from via East Midlands Parkway (for East Midlands Airport) from May 2010. Further services may be introduced in the future. There are two daily services to/from London with one calling at , , , , , and . Whilst the other train calls at , , , , , and . In addition, a handful of local services operate at either end of the day (mainly for train crew route knowledge retention purposes). A morning service runs from to and an evening service operates from to Nottingham via Peterborough. Former services According to the Official Handbook of Stations the following classes of traffic were being handled at this station in 1956: G, P, F, L, H, C and there was a 7-ton crane. Official Handbook of Stations, British Transport Commission, 1956 Just outside Melton Mowbray station the main line is joined by the Old Dalby Test Track. This runs towards Nottingham via Old Dalby, but stops short of Nottingham railway station at the edge of the suburb of West Bridgford. This is electrified with overheads, has its own control centre and dates from when the British Rail Research Division developed it as a test track for the Advanced Passenger Train, having been taken out of use some years before. It has, more recently, been used for testing Virgin Trains' Pendolino units and later for the testing of new stock for London Underground built by Derby Litchurch Lane Works.

It contains the single named species Koparion douglassi which is known only from a single isolated tooth. Discovery In 1993, Daniel Chure and Brooks Britt reported the discovery of small theropod remains, found by screenwashing large amounts of earth in the Rainbow Park near Dinosaur National Monument in Uintah County, Utah.Chure, D.J. and Britt, B.B., 1993, \\"New data on theropod dinosaurs from the Late Jurassic Morrison Fm. (MF)\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 13(3): 30A In 1994, Chure named and described a unique tooth as the type specimen of the new species Koparion douglassi. The generic name Koparion comes from the Ancient Greek κοπάριον, \\"small surgical knife\\", in reference to the small size of the tooth. The specific name honors Earl Douglass, who, in the early twentieth century, excavated the Dinosaur National Monument quarry. The holotype specimen, DINO 3353, was found in the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation dating from the late Kimmeridgian, about 151 million years old. The taxon is thus present in stratigraphic zone 6 of the Morrison Formation.Foster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327-329. The specimen consists of a single maxillary (upper cheek) tooth crown (the root is missing). It cannot be determined whether it represents a left or a right tooth. Description Hypothetical life restoration The tooth is two millimeters tall and very recurved, with a strongly convex front edge and a nearly vertical back edge. The tooth is stout, with a maximum fore-aft length of 1.9 millimeters. Both edges are serrated, showing low rectangular denticles (individual serrations). The twelve denticles on the rear edge are much higher than the fourteen on the front edge, which cover only the nearly horizontal upper part of the front edge. The tooth base, though very wide, is constricted. The base is asymmetrical, with the right side in front view protruding much further than the left side; because it is not known whether it is a left or right tooth, it cannot be established what is the inner and what the outer side. The denticles are separated by \\"blood grooves\\", and \\"blood pits\\" are also present. The back denticles point obliquely upwards but have no hooked upper corners. Classification Chure assigned Koparion to the Troodontidae based on the anatomy of the tooth. At that time, it was the oldest known troodontid, and is the first of that group discovered from the Jurassic. A troodontid presence in the Jurassic was predicted by the standard theory regarding the origin of birds, claiming that birds and troodontids are closely related (Chure suggested that they may even have been sister taxa, though this is not currently supported).Chure, D. J. (1994). \\"Koparion douglassi, a new dinosaur from the Morrison Formation (Upper Jurassic) of Dinosaur National Monument; the oldest troodontid (Theropoda: Maniraptora).\\" Brigham Young University Geology Studies, 40: 11-15. Within this context, Koparion could be used to refute the temporal paradox argument, that such a close relationship were unlikely because the then oldest known bird, Archaeopteryx, lived much earlier than the Deinonychosauria, i.e. the Troodontidae and the Dromaeosauridae;Brochu, C.A., and Norell, M.A., 2000, \\"Temporal congruence and the origin of birds\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 20: 197-200 later also non-fragmentary Jurassic troodontid material was reported, from China.Hu D., Hou L., Zhang L. and Xu X., 2009, \\"A pre-Archaeopteryx troodontid theropod from China with long feathers on the metatarsus\\", Nature 461: 640-643Xu X., Ma Q. & Hu D., 2010, \\"Pre-Archaeopteryx coelurosaurian dinosaurs and their implications for understanding avian origins\\", Chinese Science Bulletin 55: 3971–3977 See also * List of dinosaurs * Hesperornithoides - Another troodontid reported from the Jurassic. * Timeline of troodontid research References Category:Late Jurassic dinosaurs of North America Category:Troodontids Category:Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation Category:Fossil taxa described in 1994 Category:Paleontology in Utah ","title":"Koparion"},{"id":"4510458","title":"Cuckoo Moray"},{"id":"4510459","text":"Paul Moor (born 3 September 1978), of Kingston-upon-Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England is one of the world's leading ten-pin bowlers.

Smith and his siblings were raised initially with their alcoholic mother, Flo. After Flo died from choking on her own vomit when he was 13, he and his siblings were placed in a Catholic orphanage, where nuns allegedlyCapote, In Cold Blood. abused him physically and emotionally for his lifelong problem of chronic bed wetting, a result of malnutrition. He was also placed in a Salvation Army orphanage, where one of the caretakers allegedly tried to drown him. In his adolescence, Smith reunited with his father, Tex, and together they lived an itinerant existence across much of the western United States. Smith also spent time in different juvenile detention homes after joining a street gang and becoming involved in petty crime. In the mid-1960s, Tex moved to Cold Springs, Nevada, where he lived to the age of 92 before committing suicide, distraught over poor health. Two of Smith's siblings also committed suicide as young adults, and the remaining sister eliminated any contact with him.In Cold Blood: A Legacy . Lawrence Journal World. (Defunct site prior to 9/10) Military service and life in Washington At age 16, Smith joined the United States Merchant Marine. He joined the United States Army in 1948, where he served in the Korean War.Keglovits, Sally J. In Cold Blood Revisited: A Look Back at an American Crime. US Courts.gov. June 2004. Accessed: 2008-02-02. During his stint in the Army, Smith spent weeks at a time in the stockade for public carousing and fighting with Korean civilians and other soldiers. In spite of his record, Smith received an honorable discharge in 1952 and was last stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington. Smith stayed with an Army friend for a time in the Tacoma area, where he was employed as a car painter. With one of his first paychecks, Smith bought a motorcycle. While riding, he lost control of the bike due to adverse weather conditions. Smith nearly died in the accident and spent six months in a Bellingham hospital. Because of the severe injuries, his legs were permanently disabled and he suffered chronic leg pains for the rest of his life. To help control the pain, Smith consumed an excessive amount of aspirin.  The murders and life on death row  Perry Smith and Richard Hickock first met in the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, Kansas. Smith was eventually paroled, and the pair later resumed their acquaintance upon Hickock's release in November 1959. Hickock allegedly wrote to Smith, imploring him to violate his parole by returning to Kansas to assist Hickock with a robbery he had been planning. Smith claimed that his return was initially motivated not by meeting with Hickock, but by the chance to reunite with another former inmate, Willie-Jay, with whom he had developed an especially close bond while in prison; Smith soon discovered, however, that he had arrived in the Kansas City area just a few hours after Willie-Jay had left for the east coast. Smith met with Hickock, and almost immediately the two set to work carrying out Hickock's plan. Driving west to Holcomb, they entered the Clutter home through an unlocked door late in the evening of November 14, 1959, whereupon they murdered the four family members present: Herbert Clutter and his wife Bonnie, and their younger children, Nancy and Kenyon. Hickock later testified that he had gotten the idea to rob the Clutters after being told by former cellmate Floyd Wells, who had worked as a farmhand for the Clutters, that there was a safe in the family's house containing $10,000. When they invaded the house, however, they discovered that there was no such safe. After six weeks at large, mostly spent idly roaming the country, Smith and Hickock were captured in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 30, 1959, following an extensive manhunt which extended into Mexico. Smith admitted to cutting the throat of the father, Herbert Clutter, as well as shooting both Herbert and Kenyon Clutter in the head with a shotgun at close range. Records show a dispute as to which of the two shot the women, Bonnie and Nancy Clutter. Alvin Dewey, chief investigator of the Clutter family murders, testified at the trial that Hickock insisted in his confession that Smith performed all four killings; Smith, however, first confessed that Hickock killed the women, but refused to sign his confession, and later claimed to have shot them himself. Although Smith's revised confession coincided with Hickock's initial statement, both Smith and Hickock refused to testify in court, leading to a lack of an official record detailing who killed the women. While Smith had only a grade- school education, he maintained a strong interest in art, literature and music. His rough past regarding his family and abusive childhood led him to be somewhat distant from people. He read extensively, and during his time on death row, wrote poems and painted pictures for other inmates from photos of their family members.Bruntz, Michael. Witness to execution .

Smith was hanged second, dying at 1:19 am. Exhumation Nearly 50 years after the executions, the bodies of the killers were exhumed from Mount Muncie Cemetery in Lansing, as authorities hoped to solve a 53-year-old cold case using DNA. Smith and Hickock had originally been questioned about the December 19, 1959, shooting murder in Osprey, Florida of Cliff and Christine Walker and their two young children, as evidence indicated they had spent time just a few miles from the crime scene while at large after the Clutter murders. A polygraph administered at the time of their arrest cleared them of the murders, but by modern polygraph standards, their test results are no longer considered valid. On December 19, 2012, officials in Kansas exhumed the bodies of Smith and Hickock and retrieved bone fragments to compare their DNA to semen found in the pants of Christine Walker. In August 2013, the Sarasota County Sheriff's office announced they were unable to find a match between the DNA of Smith or Hickock and the samples in the Walker family murder. Only partial DNA could be retrieved, possibly due to degradation of the DNA samples over the decades or contamination in storage, making the outcome one of uncertainty (neither proving nor disproving the involvement of Smith and Hickock). Investigators have stated that Smith and Hickock still remain the most viable suspects. Film portrayals Smith was portrayed in the 1967 film version of In Cold Blood by Robert Blake, by Eric Roberts in the 1996 TV miniseries adaptation; by Clifton Collins Jr. in 2005's Capote; and by Daniel Craig in 2006's Infamous. Song Bastille's 2016 album Wild World includes a song entitled \\"Four Walls (The Ballad of Perry Smith)\\".

For instance, a central banker could make decisions on interest rates on a case-by-case basis instead of allowing a set rule, such as Friedman's k-percent rule, an inflation target following the Taylor rule, or a nominal income target to determine interest rates or the money supply. In practice, most policy actions are discretionary in nature. \\"Discretionary policy\\" can refer to decision making in both monetary policy and fiscal policy. The opposite is a commitment policy. Arguments against Monetarist economists in particular have been opponents of the use of discretionary policy. According to Milton Friedman, the dynamics of change associated with the passage of time presents a timing problem for public policy. The reason this poses a problem is because a long and variable time lag exists between: # the need for action and the recognition of that need; # the recognition of a problem and the design and implementation of a policy response; and # the implementation of the policy and the effect of the policy.Friedman, Milton. Essays in Positive Economics, University of Chicago Press, 1953. It is because of these lags that Friedman argues that discretionary public policy will often be destabilizing. For this reason, he argued the case for general rules rather than discretionary policy. Friedman formalized his argument in the context of monetary policy as follows.Friedman, Milton. \\"The effects of a full-employment policy on economic stability: A formal analysis\\", 1953, pp. 117–132 in Friedman, Milton. Essays in Positive Economics, University of Chicago Press, 1953. The quantity equation says that :MV=Y where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, and Y is nominal GDP. Expressing this in growth rates gives :m+v=y, where m, v, and y are the growth rates of the money supply, velocity and nominal GDP respectively. Suppose that the policymaker wishes for the variance of nominal GDP to be as low as possible--that is, it defines a stabilizing approach to monetary policy as one which decreases nominal GDP variance. From the last equation we have :\\\\sigma_y^2=\\\\sigma_m^2+\\\\sigma_v^2+2\\\\rho_{mv} \\\\sigma_m \\\\sigma_v, where \\\\sigma refers to the standard deviation (square root of the variance) of the subscripted variable and \\\\rho refers to the correlation coefficient between the subscripted variables. With no use of discretionary policy or any rule giving fluctuations of the money supply, \\\\sigma_m will equal zero and the target variance \\\\sigma_y^2 will simply be the exogenous variance of velocity, \\\\sigma_v^2. With the use of discretionary policy, on the other hand, all standard deviations in the above equation will be positive, and discretionary policy will have been stabilizing if and only if \\\\sigma_y^2<\\\\sigma_v^2--that is, if and only if :\\\\rho_{mv} < \\\\frac{-\\\\sigma_m}{2\\\\sigma_v}. Thus the monetary authority would have to be sufficiently astute in its policy timing, in trying to counteract anticipated fluctuations in velocity, that the correlation of its money supply changes with velocity changes is not merely negative, but sufficiently negative to overcome the inherently GDP-variance-magnifying effects of money supply variation. Friedman believed that this condition for discretionary policy to be stabilizing is unlikely to be fulfilled in practice, because of the timing problems discussed above. A related issue is the probable existence of multiplier uncertainty--imperfect knowledge of the overall ultimate effect of a policy action of a given size. Generally multiplier uncertainty calls for more caution and the use of quantitatively smaller policy actions.Brainard, William. \\"Uncertainty and the effectiveness of policy, 'American Economic Review 57 (2), 1967, 411–425. JSTOR=1821642 Arguments for Proponents of the use of discretionary policy, including in particular Keynesians, argue that our understanding of the workings of the economy is sufficiently astute, and the accessibility of detailed real-time economic data to policymakers is sufficiently great, that in practice discretionary policy has been stabilizing. For example, it is widely believed that the extreme expansion of the monetary base by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks prevented the Great Recession of the 2000s decade from becoming a full-blown depression.

The daylily Hymenocallis henryae is named in her honor.  Early life and education  Mary Gibson Henry was born near Jenkintown, Pennsylvania to Susan Worrell Pepper and John Howard Gibson in 1884. The family was known for their horticultural pursuits. Most notably, in 1828, her great-grandfather, George Pepper, was a member of the first Council of the Pennsylvania Horticulture Society. Her formal education ended in 1902 when she graduated the Agnes Irwin School in Philadelphia.  Career  Henry created and maintained gardens and greenhouses at the property where she lived. She cultivated a large kitchen garden, native rock plants, and orchards. Most of her knowledge came from foreign nursery catalogs and seed lists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She visited the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh in 1923. Following her visit, she began corresponding with William Wright Smith, the Regius Keeper at the institution, until he died in 1956. She also corresponded with Francis Pennell, curator of botany at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. She went on biannual collecting trips starting in 1929 inspired by William Bartram whose description of Rhododendron speciosum inspired her search for interesting specimens that she couldn't find in commercial or botanical gardens. On her first collecting trip, her husband and four children joined her. Over the next forty years, she went on over 200 botanical expeditions. After her five children had grown up, she set out collecting in her chauffeured car to remote areas of the American coastal plain, piedmont, and Appalachian Mountains, and in later ventures to the Ozarks and then the Rocky Mountains from New Mexico to British Columbia. As she recalled in her memoirs: :\\"I soon learned that rare and beautiful plants can only be found in places that are difficult of access ... Often one has to shove one's self through or wriggle under briars, with awkward results to clothing and many and deep cuts and scratches ... Wading, usually barelegged, through countless rattlesnake-infested swamps adds immensely to the interest of the day's work.\\" At one point she and her daughter were held up by three armed men. As she later observed: :\\"It all took place so quickly we felt as though we were at the movies. I had often wondered how it would feel to be held up and really it was not so bad at all.\\" She was president of the Philadelphia Botanical Club, council member of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society and director of the American Horticultural Society. She became a research associate at the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1941. Her garden was permanently endowed as the Henry Foundation for Botanical Research in 1950.  Family  She married John Norman Henry, a physician, in 1909. Death and legacy In April 1967, Henry died in North Carolina on a collecting trip. Her private botanical garden has now become the nonprofit Henry Foundation for Botanical Research, and is open to the public.

Along with Perry Edward Smith, Hickock took part in the burglary and multiple murder at the Clutter family farmhouse. Early life Richard Hickock was born on June 6, 1931 in Kansas City, Kansas to farmworker parents, Walter Sr. and Eunice Hickock. He was one of several siblings, including a younger brother named Walter Jr.. According to Walter Jr., their parents provided them with a good upbringing, but they were strict; he said of them, \\"I'm not sure if they were loving in the way you'd usually say a family is loving.\\" In 1947, the Hickock family relocated to the small east Kansas town of Edgerton. Hickock was a popular student and an athlete at Olathe High School. After finishing high school, Hickock had wanted to attend college, but his family lacked the means to finance his post-secondary education. Hickock went to work as a mechanic instead. Head injuries from a serious automobile accident in 1950 left Hickock disfigured, rendering his face slightly lopsided and his eyes asymmetrical. According to his brother Walter, the accident \\"almost killed him,\\" and it also changed him. After being released from the hospital, Hickock was left with hospital bills and mounting debts, leading him to start bad financial habits like writing bad checks and gambling. He drifted through several manual labor jobs, working as a railroad worker, mechanic, and ambulance driver while simultaneously continuing to write bad checks and commit petty theft. Eventually, the crime caught up with him, and in March 1958, at the age of 26, Hickock received his first prison sentence. He was imprisoned in the Kansas State Penitentiary for stealing a rifle out of a local home. When Hickock was 19, he married for the first time. However, he became involved in an extramarital affair, which eventually resulted in the conception of his first child. Hickock then decided to end his first marriage to marry his mistress, and they had two children together. While serving his 1958 prison sentence, his second wife divorced him as well. While serving his prison sentence, Hickock met fellow inmates Perry Smith and Floyd Wells, the latter of whom used to work for the Clutter family. Wells told Hickock about the affluence of the family's patriarch, Herbert Clutter, specifically telling Hickock that Clutter kept a safe in his house containing $10,000. Hickock and Smith devised a plan to rob and murder the Clutter family. Hickock was released from prison in August 1959, after serving seventeen months. Upon release from prison, he got a job at a body shop in Olathe, Kansas and tried to live an upright life; however, soon afterwards, he contacted Smith. Hickock and Smith met up in Olathe, where they collected supplies to aid in the commission of the crimes. They then went to Holcomb, where the Clutter family resided. Clutter family murders Hickock testified after the trial that he and Smith had gotten the idea to rob the Clutters after Hickock was told by Wells, their former cellmate, that there was a safe in the family's house containing $10,000. However, when they invaded the house just after midnight on November 15, 1959, Hickock and Smith discovered that there was no such safe. The pair then murdered all four members of the family. According to Truman Capote's account of the Clutter murders, In Cold Blood, Hickock was prevented by Smith from raping 16-year-old Nancy Clutter during the incident. Alvin Dewey, chief investigator in the case, testified at the trial that Hickock insisted in his confession that Smith performed all the killings. Smith, however, first claimed Hickock killed the two women, but later claimed to have shot them himself. Both defendants refused to testify during their trial. Hickock and Smith were arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 30, 1959 for the Clutter family murders, for which they were both tried and found guilty. They both talked extensively to Capote when the author was researching In Cold Blood. Execution Hickock and Smith were executed by hanging at the Kansas State Penitentiary on April 14, 1965. When asked if he had any last words, Hickock declined, but he requested to address the KBI agents who had worked on his case and now were present as witnesses to his execution. Hickock told them he had \\"no hard feelings\\" towards them, shook each agent's hand, and simply said, \\"Goodbye.\\" Smith, in contrast, attempted to speak beyond the room when he addressed the media representatives and declared: \\"capital punishment is legally and morally wrong.\\" Hickock was executed first and was pronounced dead at 12:41 am; Smith followed shortly afterward and was pronounced dead at 1:19 am. Aftermath Hickock and Smith were both buried in nearby Mount Muncie Cemetery in Lansing, Kansas. Hickock donated his eyes for corneal transplants, and they were used on two patients in Kansas City later that day. On December 18, 2012, the killers' bodies were exhumed from Mount Muncie Cemetery, as authorities hoped to solve a 53-year-old cold case using DNA. Smith and Hickock had fled to Florida after the Clutter murders, and the two had been questioned about the December 19, 1959 shooting murder of Cliff and Christine Walker and their two young children. A polygraph administered at the time of their arrest in the Clutter case cleared them of the Walker family murders, but by modern polygraph standards, their test results are no longer considered valid. After the exhumation, officials in Kansas retrieved bone fragments from Smith and Hickock's corpses in order to attempt to compare their DNA to semen found in Christine Walker's pants. In August 2013, the Sarasota County sheriff's office announced they were unable to find a match between the DNA of either Smith or Hickock with the samples in the Walker family murder. Only partial DNA could be retrieved, possibly due to degradations of the DNA samples over the decades or contamination in storage, making the outcome one of uncertainty (neither proving nor disproving the involvement of Smith and Hickock). Consequently, investigators have stated that Smith and Hickock still remain the most viable suspects. In 2017, The Wall Street Journal uncovered a handwritten manuscript that Hickock wrote during the time that he awaited his execution on death row. The manuscript, reportedly titled The High Road to Hell, allegedly shone a light on the motive behind the murders, which to this day is in dispute. Before his execution, Hickock had insisted (and Smith concurred) that Smith committed all of the murders himself. However, Hickock's manuscript describes how he shined a flashlight on each of the four Clutters' heads while Smith fired; Hickock's only regret, according to the manuscript, was that Smith did all of the killing and Hickock personally committed no murders. In discussing his alleged motive, Hickock claimed that he had committed the killings in a murder-for-hire plot in exchange for $5,000 from a man only named Roberts, writing, \\"I was going to kill a person. Maybe more than one. Could I do it? Maybe I'll back out. But I can't back out, I've taken the money. I've spent some of it. Besides, I thought, I know too much.\\" Throughout 1961, Hickock sent the manuscript to reporter Mack Nations, who had promised to convert it into a book-length manuscript. After completing the project, Nations sent the converted manuscript to the publishing company Random House, but they sent it back and let Nations know that they had already commissioned Capote to write about the Clutter murders. Writer Kevin Helliker of the Journal speculated that Hickock may have been pathologically lying or engaging in fantasy in his manuscript, arguing that had Hickock's story been true, he and Smith likely would have used the information to try to negotiate their way out of their death sentences by pinning the crime on Roberts, and he and Smith would not have struggled to make ends meet after the crime if they had been paid for it. Michael Stone, a Columbia University psychiatrist who specialized in studying Smith and Hickock, read the manuscript at the request of the Journal and said on the record, \\"I don't believe for a minute that they got paid to do it.\\" Film portrayals Hickock was portrayed by Scott Wilson in the 1967 film adaptation of In Cold Blood; by Anthony Edwards in the 1996 TV miniseries adaptation; by Mark Pellegrino in the 2005 film Capote; and by Lee Pace in the 2006 film Infamous.

Once positioned correctly the cylinder head will be bolted down on top of it, using a torque wrench. A head gasket is a gasket that sits between the engine block and cylinder head(s) in an internal combustion engine. Its purpose is to seal the cylinders to ensure maximum compression and avoid leakage of coolant or engine oil into the cylinders; as such, it is the most critical sealing application in any engine, and, as part of the combustion chamber, it shares the same strength requirements as other combustion chamber components.  Purpose  The usual internal combustion engine is a water-cooled four-stroke gasoline design. It uses three circuits of working fluids: #Combustible air/fuel mixture #Water-based coolant, usually with glycol mixed #Motor oil for lubrication These are all vital, but must never be allowed to intermix. Apart from sealing the cylinder, the head gasket also seals water and oil conduits between the head and block. Any connectivity between them will cause engine failure, or significant problems like burning oil (smoke from the exhaust). Blue exhaust smoke may be indicative of oil burning. White exhaust smoke is an indicator of coolant burning, another sign of head gasket wear. Types * Multi-Layer Steel (MLS): Most modern engines are produced with MLS gaskets. These consist of two to five (typically three) thin layers of steel, interleaved with elastomer. The contact faces are usually coated with a rubber-like coating such as Viton which adheres to the engine block and cylinder head while the inner layers are optimized for resilience. * Solid copper: a solid sheet of copper, and typically requires special machining called O-ringing that places a piece of wire around the circumference of the cylinder to bite into the copper. When this is performed copper gaskets are very durable. * Composite: an older design which is more prone to blowouts than newer designs. Composite gaskets are traditionally made from asbestos or graphite but asbestos gaskets are becoming increasingly rare due to health concerns. * Elastomeric: uses a steel core plate with molded in place silicone rubber beads to seal oil and coolant passages. The bores are sealed by rolled steel fire rings in a more conventional manner. This type of gasket was used in the Rover K-series engine. * O-ring: these gaskets are typically built from steel or copper. They are reusable and if used between correctly prepared flat surfaces will yield the highest clamping pressure, due to their much lower surface area compared with other gasket types.  Gasket failure  Occasionally, the compression in the cylinder will cause a leak to form in the gasket thus needing replacement, otherwise severe damage can take place and eventually become a \\"blown\\" head gasket. This problem has been exacerbated by the use of aluminum rather than iron cylinder heads; while lighter than iron, aluminum has a much greater thermal expansion rate, which in turn causes a great deal more stress to be placed on the head gasket. Engine manufacturers have responded to this problem by adding a non-stick coating such as Teflon to the surface of the head gasket. If the gasket fails, then the engine is either facing compression loss issues, leakage issues or a combination of both: A damaged head gasket can allow gases to leak between cylinders.  Compression loss:  Compression loss from a damaged head gasket can lead to power reduction, or a rough engine. This is because exhaust and intake gases are either leaking out of the cylinder or being forced into the cooling system, which leads to the engine overheating and can also lead to increased engine wear due to the motor oil being mixed with antifreeze. In other occurrences the gases can leak into small spaces between the gasket and either the cylinder head or engine block traps those gases, and then released when the engine is turned off. These gases then escape into the coolant and create air pockets. Sometimes these air pockets can get trapped in the engine's coolant thermostat, causing it to stay closed and cause further overheating, thereby creating more voids between the gasket and the engine. Other times these air pockets can also cause the engine to expel coolant into the overflow or expansion tank, thereby reducing the amount of coolant, the engine has available, to stay cool.  Leakage:  A damage head gasket can cause coolant to leak into the cylinders thus tampering with the combustion cycle and causes the exhaust to blow out steamNunney, p. 23.,damaging the catalytic converter. If a very large amount of coolant leaks into the cylinders, then the engine can suffer from hydrolock, which can cause extensive engine damage. Sometimes, all that may happen when a head gasket is blown is excessive steam erupting from the tailpipe, yet the engine may act and drive like normal (keep in mind that the steam is still damaging the catalytic converter), until all the coolant is gone and the engine starts to overheat. The condition of a head gasket is typically investigated by checking the compression pressure with a pressure gauge, or better, a leak-down test, and/or noting any indication of combustion gases in the cooling system on a water-cooled engine. Oil mixed with coolant and excessive coolant loss with no apparent cause, or presence of carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon gases in the expansion tank of the cooling system can also be signs of head gasket problems. A good sign of head gasket failure on water-cooled engines is the presence of a substance that resembles mayonnaise in the oil, often to be seen on the dipstick, or oil filler cap. However, the presence of this substance is not conclusive proof of head gasket failure, since oil could mix with the coolant via other routes. Likewise, it is entirely possible for a head gasket to fail in such a way that oil never comes in contact with coolant. Because of this, oil that has NOT become contaminated with coolant should not be taken as a definitive sign that the head gasket is okay. A leaking head gasket can be classified as either external or internal. An external leak can be identified as oil and coolant accumulating underneath the engine. The presence of coolant can be detected by shining a black light on what appears to be an oil leak; the appearance of coolant will show up under the black light. External leaks can also appear as previously described in the oil. An internal leak can usually be diagnosed by excessive coolant accumulating in the expansion tank along with the presence of hydrocarbons in the form of foam. The possibility of vapors or condensation and/or water (from the road or rain) building up (in aftermarket product installation) from an external breather or catch tank from the head (rocker cover) can also cause a buildup of froth or foam in the oil but is highly unlikely. The cost of a replacement gasket is usually not extreme, but the price of total repair is significantly high. This is because the process of removing/replacing an engine head is very time-consuming—around 75% of cost will be labor. Furthermore, untreated blown gaskets usually seriously damage the engine, then requiring even more expensive work.  Effect of engine knocking  Engine knocking (detonation) can be caused by poor quality fuel, an engine fault or if inappropriate fuel and/or ignition settings are trialled chosen while engine tuning is taking place. If the detonation is severe, the cylinder pressure can be increase to 8 times above normal pressures, which can cause the cylinder head to lift away from the engine block, disrupting the seal between the two. Most gaskets used in standard production engines can be critically damaged by severe detonation.

He distinguished himself in Canada during the Fenian raids, and was thanked in Parliament for suppressing riots in Jamaica. Early life De Horsey was the son of Spencer de Horsey, of Great Glemham Suffolk, and Lady Louise, a daughter of the first Earl of Stradbroke. His only sister was the Countess of Cardigan, whose reminiscences caused a scandal when they were published. Naval career De Horsey joined the Royal Navy in 1840William Loney RN and served on the coast of Syria later that year. He received the Naval General Service Medal and bar for his service in Syria as well as a medal for his service in Acre given by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Promoted to Lieutenant in July 1846 and to Commander in June 1853, he was given command of the paddle sloop HMS Devastation that same month and of HMS Victor from November 1855. Promoted to Captain in September 1857, he commanded HMS Brisk from May 1859, HMS Wolverine from May 1864, HMS Aurora from November 1865 and HMS Hector from May 1868. He was Senior Officer on the Lakes of Canada during the Fenian raids; for this he was awarded the Canadian Medal. In 1871 he was made ADC to Queen Victoria.Obituary: Algernon De Horsey, The Times, October 1922 In July 1872, having been promoted to Commodore, he became Senior Naval Officer in Jamaica with his pennant in HMS Aboukir and responsible for superintending Jamaica Dockyard. He captured the Spanish slaver Manuela, and suppressed riots in Jamaica for which he was thanked in Parliament. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station in 1876, with his flag in HMS Repulse, HMS Shah and then HMS Triumph. In this capacity he engaged with the Huáscar during the Peruvian civil war. He was made Commander-in-Chief, Channel Squadron with his flag in HMS Northumberland in December 1884. He was promoted to full Admiral in April 1885 and placed on retired list in July 1892. On 8 September 1878, Admiral de Horsey in the Shah visited Pitcairn Island. His Admiralty report includes the remark, \\"One stranger, an American, has settled on the island – a doubtful acquisition.\\" This line inspired Mark Twain to write the fictional story \\"The Great Revolution in Pitcairn\\" (1879). He was appointed KCB on 9 November 1903 and lived at Melcombe House in Cowes. He frequently contributed letters to The Times and wrote An African Pilot and The Rule of the Road at Sea. He was chairman of Isle of Wight magistrates for many years and Deputy Lieutenant. On 7 November 1913, he was appointed a deputy governor of the Isle of Wight. He died on 22 October 1922 and was described by The Times as \\"Doyen of the Navy\\". He is buried, together with his wife Caroline, at Carisbrooke (Mountjoy) Cemetery within sight of Carisbrooke Castle. Family He married Caroline, daughter of Admiral Andrew Drew, in 1861 and was the father of Louisa Mary Adeline de Horsey Phillips and grandfather of Admiral Tom Phillips. His son was Vice Admiral Victor Yorke de Horsey while his other daughter married Major William Croughton of the 3rd Dragoon Guards.

It lived in what is now the Liaoning Province of China. Sinusonasus was a theropod, specifically a troodontid dinosaur. The type species, Sinusonasus magnodens, was named and described by Xu Xing and Wang Xiaolin in 2004.Xu X. and Wang X.-l. 2004. \\"A New Troodontid (Theropoda: Troodontidae) from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Western Liaoning, China\\". Acta Geologica Sinica 78(1): 22-26 The generic name, derived from Latin sinus, \\"wave\\", and nasus, \\"nose\\", refers to the sinusoid form, in lateral view, of the nasals. The specific name means \\"big-toothed\\" from Latin magnus, \\"large\\" and dens, \\"tooth\\". In a later publication the species is referred to as \\"Sinucerasaurus\\"Xu X., and Norell, M., 2006, \\"Non- avian dinosaur fossils from the Lower Cretaceous Jehol Group of western Liaoning, China\\", Geological Journal, 41(3-4): 419-437 but this is a junior objective synonym. The holotype, IVPP V 11527, was found in the Lujiatun Member of the Yixian Formation, dating from the Hauterivian. It consists of a partial skeleton including skull and lower jaw fragments and partial tail, pelvis and hindlimbs. The fossil is compressed and partially articulated. Sinusonasus is a small troodontid. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at one metre, its weight at 2.5 kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 141 The femur is 141 millimetres long. In 2004, several distinguishing traits were established. An interantorbital channel, connecting the antorbital fenestrae at each skull side, is lacking. The nasal bone has an undulating profile. The middle maxillary teeth are rather large. The chevrons on the rear caudal vertebrae are so long, measured from the front to the back, that they connect, forming a continuous plate at the underside of the tail. The neck of the thighbone is elongated. More generally, the head is relatively short, equalling 77% of the length of the thighbone. There are at least nineteen maxillary teeth per side. The front teeth are not serrated: those more to the rear only have denticles at the trailing edge. Five sacral vertebrae are present; the tail probably consisted of about thirty vertebrae. The pubic bone probably pointed obliquely to the front. The ischium is elongated. Sinusonasus has a long lower leg, indicating a good running capacity. The foot is \\"arctometatarsal\\", with a 'pinched' upper third metatarsal. The second metatarsal is distinctly shorter than the fourth. The second toe bears a retractable 'sickle claw'. Sinusonasus was in 2004 placed in the Troodontidae. It was presumed to have had a rather derived position, despite living in the Early Cretaceous. This was by the describing authors not interpreted as an indication for a long ghost lineage, troodontids developing earlier during the Jurassic than had been thought, but explained by rapid evolutionary change after a Cretaceous origin of the group.

Mole Creek is well known for its honey and accounts for about 35 percent of Tasmania's honey production. History  Australian Aboriginals have lived on the island of Tasmania for thousands of years. The earliest archaeological evidence for Aboriginal habitation of Tasmania is from the valley of the Forth River, 35000 years before the present.Jupp, p.110 Prior to European settlement, Mole Creek, along with much of the surrounding area, was part of the lands of the Pallittorre aboriginal tribe. Their range included Deloraine, the face of the Great Western Tiers, and the Gog mountain range to the north of Mole Creek where they mined ochre in the Toolumbunner ochre pits.Jupp, p.111 There is evidence that they had been settled in the Mole Creek area for at least 10,000 years. As Europeans moved onto their land the two groups came into conflict, many aboriginals and some Europeans were killed. Their population in the area has been estimated to drop from 200 to 60 during 1827-30.Australian Garden History Society, pp.1-4 During the 1820s, the Van Diemen's Land Company cut a stock route from Deloraine to Emu Bay (now known as Burnie) via Chudleigh and Mole Creek. Prior to this cattlemen had run cattle and built stockman's huts on the land west of Westbury. From the 1820s onwards land grants began being issued as the land was gradually surveyed.Evans & Terry, p.9 A systemic exploration of Mole Creek and the area west was conducted in 1826 by Edward Curr, Joseph Fossey and Henry Hellyer.Evans & Terry, p.20 Mole Creek was originally a mixture of tall forest, plains and boggy marsh. Settlers in the early 19th century cleared the land largely using fire and the ring barking of trees.Evans & Terry, p.33 The land was first held in large leaseholds by the wealthiest in the colony of Tasmania. In the mid-19th century a number of waste lands acts were passed by the government allowing for smaller holdings, opening up the then densely forested land around the town of Mole Creek.Evans & Terry, p.26 Many of these first settlers were farm labourers or ex-convicts, who had worked as labourers or tenant farmers on the larger holdings. The name Mole Creek comes from a nearby stream, recorded as early as the Land Commissioner's reports' maps from 1826-28. This creek flows above ground, and in portions underground through the caves underlying the area.Evans & Terry, p.11 The caves of the nearby Mole Creek Karst National Park, which include the show caves Marakoopa Cave and King Solomons Cave, have attracted tourists since the 1850s. Their popularity encouraged the establishment of tourist facilities in Mole Creek including Howe's Boarding House and Lee's Mountain View Guest House.Evans & Terry, p.79 By 1876 the town had a water-powered flour mill and water powered saw mill. At the same time a Wesleyan chapel and minister's residence were being constructed. A post office opened on 28 May 1884 though the town remained small. A former resident remembered Mole Creek in the 1890s as \\"a small bush settlement\\"Green, p.4 Lime kilns were built at Mole Creek in the late 19th century, taking advantage of the extensive limestone in the area.Evans & Terry, p.21  20th Century  In the early 20th century the opening of some scenic caves for tourism lead to further development in the town. King Solomon's Cave was discovered in 1906 and opened for tours in 1908. Marakoopa cave was found in 1910, opened in 1912 and sold to the state tourist department in 1919.Sydney, pp.23-24 Edward Charles James, who had obtained a lease on King Solomon's Cave, built what is now the Mole creek hotel over 1907-8 as a 30-room guest house. Due to some unusual sale conditions he could not serve alcohol. The building was sold in 1910 to George Lee who ran it as the Mountain View Guest House. A grocery and hardware shop ran from part of the building from 1929 to 1965. In June 1953 the sale conditions were overcome and a licence to serve alcohol was granted.Sydney, p.25The history of the hotel's use is recorded in a commemorative sign in its lobby R Stephens honey factory Robert Stephens had kept bees as a hobby. After he returned from service in World War I he continued his interest. He opened a commercial honey production facility in Mole Creek in 1918. By 1923 the factory had 50 hives and was selling honey under the Golden Bee brand.Evans & Terry, p.38 Since 1951 it has concentrated on leatherwood honey. Each year hives are transported to Tasmania's west coast to make honey with the distinctive flavour of leatherwood (Eucryphia lucida and Eucryphia milliganii).Holland, pp.117-118 The Factory and Apiary are provisionally registered on the Tasmanian Heritage Register. It has operated on the same site since operations began; the oldest building is a c.1920 timber cottage and the prominent façade that faces the main road dates from the 1970s. The factory is run by Stephen's decedents using the \\"Golden Bee\\" label introduced in 1930 and the \\"Golden Nectar\\" label for leatherwood honey introduced 1951. As of 2010 it was producing of honey each year and approximately 35% of all Tasmanian honey. Electricity, supplied by the Hydroelectric Commission, reached Mole Creek in 1936 and street lighting was installed soon after.Sydney, p.5 Construction of a memorial hall began at the end of 1950, funded by a state government grant of 1000 pounds. A driving force behind construction was the school's lack of a recreation hall forcing them to on occasion rent the Methodist Hall. The Mole Creek bush nursing centre was opened in mid-1944. and came under control of the Launceston Public Hospitals District Board in 1968.Evans & Terry, p.43 The site is now a health centre housing the Mole Creek Child Health Centre and is operated by the Department of Health and Human Services. Railway A rail line was opened in 1890. It ran to Mole Creek, through Chudleigh, from a junction near Deloraine on the Western Line. There was a plan to extend the line further west and government surveyors employed to this end. The survey was cancelled in 1891Evans & Terry, p.32 and by 1900 there was no longer an expectation that the line would be extended to Tasmania's west coast. Throughout its existence, it carried mostly timber destined for the paper mill at Burnie and, in later days, woodchips for Bell Bay. From the 1920s passenger services, which on occasion ran as far as Devonport, were mostly conducted by railcars.Stokes, pp.243-252 From the 1970s to the 1980s the track saw extensive use transporting limestone to South Burnie. The rail extension was closed in 1985 and the track lifted in 1992. Religion St Andrew's Presbyterian Church The Deloraine Wesleyan district decided, in 1875, to erect a chapel in Mole creek. Construction began on the Methodist (Wesleyan) church, on donated land, and an associated cottage in late 1876. It was completed in 1878, then enlarged in 1880, at which time the original building was moved to the rear and used as a supper room. An adjacent church hall was added in 1919. The Wesleyan chapel was rented by the Government for a school from at least June 1879. A new parsonage was built and opened in 1956 but was subsequently sold to Forestry Tasmania in 1972. In 1976, along with most Methodist churches in Australia, it became part of the Uniting Church in Australia.Stansall, p.65 It was still used as of 1996Sydney, p.2 but was subsequently closed and sold.Online sale records date the closure to prior to 2009. A news report in 1900 reports that, in addition to the Wesleyan weatherboard church, there was a Baptist church and in 1905 the town had a Seventh-day Adventist church.Evans & Terry, p.87 In the 19th century Anglican services were held in the Wesleyan chapel. St Colombia's Anglican church was built in Mole Creek and dedicated in September 1902 by Bishop Henry Montgomery and Gilbert White, a missionary. The church was in the parish of DeloraineHenslowe, p.46 and was closed in the early 1990s.Stephens, p.138 Mole Creek's only remaining church is part of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, in the Presbytery of Bass. St Andrew's church was consecrated 12 September 1932. It celebrated its 40th Anniversary in 1972 Miller, p.33 and remains in use. Geography and Climate The town of Mole Creek lies at above sea level.Davey, p.23 The Mole Creek-Chudleigh karst is an area underlain by limestone with underground streams, sinkholes and caves. It was formed when Gondwanaland was covered by a shallow sea approximately 500 million years ago. The area has a layer of Ordovician limestone, approximately thick covering an area , and other sedimentary rocks.Lloyd, p.50 The town is surrounded by a plain underlain by this limestone which crops up through the overlying sediments.Parks and Wildlife Service, p.13 Nearby hills have prominent basalt, limestone and dolerite depending on location. The flats are of alluvial origin with Permian sediments formed from mudstone and sandstone.Topoclimate Services, pp.25-26 The karst is riddled with over 400 caves and sinkholes, some of which are open to the public.Lloyd, p.51 King Solomon's Cave and the Marakoopa Caves became part of a state cave reserve in 1939. The caves and many other parts of the karst became part of the Mole Creek Karst National Park when it was formed in 1996.Evans & Terry, p.80 The agricultural land around Mole Creek is mostly suited to grazing, intensive in some areas, though some is marginal cropping land that requires careful crop rotation with seasons where the land must be left fallow.Topoclimate Services, p.27 Mole creek has a cool temperate climate. The area is notably frosty in winter and experiences the occasional snowfall.Topoclimate Services, p.24 The average rainfall of 1,122mm of average rainfall is derived from weather records over 1914 to 2015 is significantly higher than parts of the Meander Valley Council area further to the east. The average rainfall has noticeably declined over the past 3-4 decades. School Mole Creek Primary school is a government school for students from kindergarten to grade 6 that has, as of 2015, 76 students. There was a state school in Mole Creek by 1900.Evans & Terry, pp.61 It was changed to a district or area school in 1936. A single-room school building, and associated teacher's residence, had been constructed over 1892-93 in Caveside. When the school was closed in 1937 the building was moved to Mole Creek in 1938 and used for 'domestic arts' at school.Reunion Committee, p.15 Western Creek, near Meander, had a school from 1893 to 1938. After it closed some students attended Meander's school, but others moved to schools at Mole Creek and Deloraine. This school building was also moved and added to those at Mole Creek's school.Woods & Pennicott, pp.96–98 The primary school services surrounding districts including Chudleigh and Caveside. The nearest high school is in Deloraine. Current Town The town is named after Mole Creek, a tributary of the Mersey River.Whitworth, p.136 This creek is named due to the way that it appears above ground, descends below ground into the limestone cave system, then reappears multiple times. The main industries in the area are forestry, farming, limestone mining and the R Stephen's honey factory. One of the largest non-farm employers in the area is Unimim Lime Limited.Davey, p.19 They quarry and process limestone to make quicklime and hydrated lime. As of 2007 they employed 28 people at Mole Creek Mole Creek is well known for its honey and accounts for about 35 percent of Tasmania's honey production including Leatherwood honey--a noted monofloral honey--which is unique to Tasmania and sold internationally. Nearby is the Mole Creek Karst National Park , which includes the show caves Marakoopa Cave and King Solomons Cave. These caves have been popular with tourists for over 100 years. Trowunna wildlife park is a private sanctuary a short distance on the main road towards Chudleigh. The park contains native Australian animals both in enclosures and free-ranging. It works as part of the effort to preserve Tasmanian devils by keeping a population that are free of facial tumour disease, and runs as a training centre for animal handling and animal keeping. Mole Creek has a volunteer fire brigade. It first ran from 1956 to 1962 and was disbanded due to lack of local interest. A district brigade and fire station had been re- established by 1970.Evans & Terry, p.55 The town had a cricket club by the early 20th century and an Australian rules football club by 1946.Evans & Terry, p.77 The football club still exists and plays in the Leven Football Association. The cricket club plays in the Northern Midlands Cricket Association. The town has a community maintained swimming pool. Mole Creek's cemetery opened in 1916, serving also Caveside,Evans & Terry, p.95 and remains open. Mole Creek has a hotel, established in 1907, a guest house and restaurant, a swimming pool and adjacent community hall, supermarket, service station, post office and a church. Mole Creek is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Division of Lyons—for the state house of assembly and the federal house of representatives— and the state legislative council electoral division of Western Tiers. At the 2011 census, Mole Creek's statistical area--covering --had a population of 609 though the town itself had only 230.

The area is largely a farming district. Significant agricultural enterprises include organic dairy producer Elgaar Farm, berry producer Christmas Hills Raspberry Farm and the Ashgrove Cheese Farm. Land grants began in the area from the 1820s, and later a town was laid out based on allotments. Until the 1970s, when some land was further subdivided on the east side of what is now the Bass Highway, the town area had only three houses and had not become a population centre. Consequent to the subdivision more dwellings were built and there were more than forty by 2002. At the 2006 census, the Elizabeth Town area had a population of 502. John Spicer built and opened a hotel on the road from Deloraine north to Devonport in the 1850s. Just prior to 1900 the then owner, Charles Slater, demolished the building replaced it with the current structure. Slater had used money from a lottery win to build the new hotel. The hotel, which sits by the Bass Highway, is now run as ETC--the Elizabeth Town café. Elizabeth once had a school, tennis courts, a Catholic church, an Anglican church, post office and a hall. Of these only two church buildings remain converted to houses.Greenhill, p.66 A post office opened on in September 1860, with a resident post master, and closed in 1969. The Tasmanian Archdiocese extended Roman Catholic services to cover Elizabeth Town in 1924. A new church was built and first held services 22 January 1939. It was a contemporary style brick building with a tiled roof, concrete slab foundation, Tasmanian hardwood ceiling and coloured leadlight windows. The church's land had been donated by Mr T Clearly, then owner of the hotel. The Church of Our Lady Help of Christians was designed to hold 100 parishioners. Anglican services were first held in the Elizabeth Town state school. The foundation stone for the Anglican Holy Cross church was laid in January 1892 and it opened for services in January 1893.Henslowe, p.23 This church was replaced in the 1950s and a five sided apsidal sanctuary was built in 1955 and dedicated in August of the same year. The building was remodelled and had a vestry added in 1966.Stephens, p.129 The church celebrated its 60th anniversary in December 1952, but by was only used for Christmas services. The church closed and a decision to sell it made in 2011 by the Parish of Deloraine to sell this in 2011.

History   Islington Green School  Logo of Islington Green School Islington Green School (IGS) was established in 1966 and was an 11–16 mixed community secondary school. The school failed its Ofsted inspection in 1997. The school had received a 38 percent pass rate the previous year and despite shortcomings, the staff were convinced that the school was not failing. The decision caused the school to \\"implode\\". The headteacher, under enormous pressure to make visible changes discarded mixed- ability teaching, many teachers decided to leave, and the pass rate dropped below 25 percent. The school went through nine inspections before it finally came out of special measures in 2000 and serious weaknesses in 2003. Ken Muller, a teacher at the school and SWP activist, made a request to Ofsted under the new Freedom of Information Act to see the documents relating to the judgment. Twenty working days later, he got a reply. Most of the documents had been destroyed, said the email, but there was one that might be of interest. Attached was a memo dated November 1997, from HMI Barry Jones to the then chief inspector Chris Woodhead, making clear that the HMI team, of which Jones was a member, had disagreed with Ofsted's judgment, and noting that they were \\"of the unanimous view that the school was not failing\\".

It is the administrative center of the homonymous Knezha Municipality. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 11,191 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009 The town's name is most probably derived from the Slavic word knyaz (\\"prince, duke\\"), most likely after a local ruler that defended the population in the area during the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria. Knezha is the third-largest town in the province, after Pleven and Cherven Bryag, and is the administrative centre of a municipality. The town was located in Vratsa province until 2001, when a boundary change shifted the town into Pleven province. A local landmark is the steel Christian cross constructed on a hill overlooking the town. The cross' construction was financed entirely by donations. It has luminescent lighting bodies attached to it and is illuminated in blue at night. The cross is similar to the larger Millennium Cross above Skopje. Knezha also has a historical museum and an amateur theatre performing in the local community centre (chitalishte). The Institute on Maize of the Agricultural Academy is based in Knezha; it was founded in 1924.

The most well-known of these co-ops is the United Fanzine Organization, or UFO, a co-operative of minicomic creators that has existed since about 1968, when it was called Blue Plaque Publications (BPP). Carl Gafford, at that point the publisher of a comics fanzine called Minotaur, created the BPP; among its earliest members were Chuck Robinson II (publisher of Comique), Dwight Decker (True Fan Adventure Theatre), Ed Romero (Realm), and Gordon Matthews (Coffinworm).  Function  The BPP was the first small press minicomics co-op. The term co-op has often been confused with Amateur Press Associations or APAs. The difference is that an APA is helmed by a central mailer, to whom the members send copies of their publications. The central mailer then compiles all the books into one large volume, which is then mailed out to the membership in apazines. Some APAs are still active, and some are published as virtual \\"e-zines,\\" distributed on the internet. In a co- op, however, there is no central mailer; the members distribute their own works, and are linked by a group newsletter, a group symbol that appears on each member work, and a group checklist in every member zine.  History   BPP disbands; UFO forms  The original BPP disbanded in early 1972, but was revived later that same year by Steve Keeter, who had been the last of the original members voted in before its collapse. During Keeter's tenure as chairman, the name was changed to the United Fanzine Organization, and a new constitution was adopted. Notable members during this second phase of UFO history included Jim Main, Kurt Erichsen, Larry Johnson, Don Fortier, and Rod Snyder. For a short time, The Comics Journal, one of the most prominent and highest-circulation 'zines of the day, was also a member. The UFO's monthly newsletter, reproduced by ditto, mimeo, photocopying, or later by offset printing, was known as Tetragrammaton Fragments.  1980s: UFO revival  When the UFO again disbanded during the early 1980s, it was revived yet again by Jim Main. The group has continued ever since, and many of the finest publishers in the comics small press have been, and continue to be members. Chairmen have included Ian Shires, J. Kevin Carrier, Nik Dirga, Sam Gafford, John Yeo Jr., Bob Elinskas, Jason DeGroot, and Nic Carcieri.Rhode Island Comic Creators Announce Assembly. New England Small Press Assembly. 17 Oct. 2009. Longtime small-press cartoonist/self-publisher Steve Shipley succeeded Carcieri as chairman in November 2010. The most recent UFO chairman (beginning in 2020) is Steve Keeter, who had been the group's chairman three times previously -- in the mid-1970s, late 1980s and early 1990s.  Other co-ops  There have been a number of other co-ops created over the years, including: * Small Press Syndicate (SPS) * Small Press League (SPL) — founded in 1986 by Liam Brooks, Andrew Roller, Will Dockery, David Cushman and Rick Howe * Pizazz * Self Publisher Association (SPA) — founded by Ian Shires * BPP — a new group appropriating the original name, begun by Jim Main and Steve Keeter in 1999 While each of these groups has its own distinctive character, they all follow the basic co-op format that was established by Carl Gafford decades ago.

History The history of Oleszyce dates back to the early 15th century, when the village belonged to Poland’s Ruthenian Voivodeship. It was first mentioned in documents from 1431, as Heleschicze; its name was also spelled as Olieschicze, Oleczyce and Olessicze, and probably comes from male name Olech or Olesz. In 1458, a wooden Roman Catholic parish church was built here by the Ramsza family, owners of the village. In 1570, Oleszyce became property of Voivode of Ruthenia, Hieronim Sieniawski, who in 1576 established here a town named Hieronimow, based on Magdeburg rights. The town was located between the already existing village, and a manor house, and its charter was confirmed by King Stefan Batory on February 26, 1578. The name Hieronimow was seldom used, and by mid-17th century, disappeared, replaced by ancient name Oleszyce. In the mid-17th century, Hieronimow/Oleszyce had 107 houses and over 1000 residents, with Catholic and Orthodox churches. In the early 18th century, Oleszyce became main center of properties of the noble Sieniawski family: here, in 1706, a secret meeting between Crown Hetman Adam Mikolaj Sieniawski and Saxon envoy named Spiegel took place. Across centuries, Oleszyce was frequently raided and destroyed by Crimean Tatars (1498, 1624, 1672), Zaporozhian Cossacks (1610, 1629, 1648), burned in fires (1710, 1726), its population was also decimated by plagues (1626, 1641). In 1731, Oleszyce became property of the Czartoryski family. After the Partitions of Poland, the town belonged to Austrian Galicia (1772–1918), but remained private property of the families of Dzialynski, Potocki, Potulicki and Sapieha. In 1880, Oleszyce lost its town charter. In the Second Polish Republic, Oleszyce was part of Lwow Voivodeship. In 1938, its population was 3500, divided between Poles (920), Ukrainians (860), and Jews (1700). The village was captured by the Wehrmacht on September 12, 1939. A few days later, heavy fighting between the advancing Germans and retreating Polish 21st Mountain Infantry Division took place in the area of Oleszyce, in which General Jozef Kustron was killed (September 16). German presence in Oleszyce was short, as on September 20, the village was occupied by the Red Army. On 15 November, Oleszyce was annexed to the Soviet Union as part of the Ukrainian SSR, and German-Soviet boundary was established a few kilometers north of the village (see also Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact). In June 1941, the NKVD murdered a number of prisoners, kept in the local castle (see NKVD prisoner massacres). In November 1942, the Germans displaced more than 2.000 Jews from Oleszyce to the Lubaczow ghetto, established on October 8, 1942. According to one source, about 1.000 of these Jews were sent to the Belzec death camp before the end of November. After the liquidation of the Lubaczow ghetto in January 1943, many Jews ran away and went into hiding in Oleszyce and its surroundings. From January until March 1943, more than 127 Jews from Oleszyce and neighboring villages were executed in the Jewish cemetery. After World War II, the village and its area was affected by the activities of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which in the night of September 5/6, 1945, attacked Oleszyce with the rail station. Ukrainian nationalists were defeated by Polish Army battalion, but before that happened, they managed to burn down several houses.
