Some time after that, he established a gristmill at the site. The Brooklyn mill burned down in about 1912. Henry Ford purchased the property in 1921, but did not use it for some time. In 1938, he constructed a new building constructed on the site, and the plant opened in 1939. It employed up to 130 people making workers horn buttons and starter switches. During World War II, production shifted to brass spark plug bushings for B-24 bombers. After the war, the line returned to making horn buttons and starter switches until 1954, when production shifted to armrests and lamp lenses. The Brooklyn site closed in 1967. After it was closed, the building was owned by Industrial Automotive Products, a subsidiary of Jackson Gear. The building has been recently used to house a collector's Model T collection, then housed an alternative fuel research company. The building was purchased by Daniel and Samantha Ross in 2014 and is being converted into an Irish themed destination called the Old Irish Mill. However, funding fell through in 2018.

Early life and career Fairbairn was born at Longhirst in Northumberland, the fourth of five children of Robert Fairbairn and his wife, Christina Robertson. His family moved to Perth in Scotland, where he attended the Perth Academy. His father was employed as head gamekeeper to Lord Forteviot at Dupplin Castle in Perthshire. After leaving school, he joined the Clydesdale Bank in Perth at 17. In his youth, Fairbairn was active as a sportsman in the Perth area.

In June 1930, he signed for Scottish Football League club St Johnstone as an amateur. He made his senior debut in a 1‚Äì1 home draw against King's Park on 23 August 1930, but was \\"severely barracked\\" by a Muirton Park crowd disappointed by both his and the team's performance. After the Clydesdale Bank transferred Fairbairn to their head office in Glasgow, he continued his cricket career as an opening batsman for West of Scotland, and also played football for \\"one of the Queen's Park elevens\\".

He is best known as the author of the alchemical works Splendor Solis and Aureum Vellus. Biography Little is known about Trismosin's life beyond the legendary tales of his journeys found in works attributed to him. These tales, according to historian of religion J. Peter S√∂derg√•rd, had little value other than providing an \\"aura of historicity\\" to the texts attributed to him. The name Salomon Trismosin is also likely a pseudonym. Occultist Franz Hartmann claimed the actual name of Trismosin was \\"Pfieffer\\" (though he provides no evidence for this claim) and historian Stephen Skinner identifies him with Ulrich Poysel, who was a teacher of Paracelsus. Most of the source for his life comes from a short autobiography written in Aureum Vellus. He is said to have begun his interest in alchemy when observing an alchemist and miner named Flocker perform an alchemical operation that allegedly transmuted lead into gold. The miner died shortly after, never revealing his secret to the young Trismosin. This led to a lifelong search for such alchemical secrets. Trismosin writes that in 1473 he set out on a journey to find a true alchemist. He found only frauds and fools claiming to have transmuted base metals into silver and gold, which put him off his search for some time. Having abandoned his search, he came to a college in Venice where he met a German alchemist named Tauler. Tauler taught Trismosin his alchemical secrets and Trismosin learned how to transmute mercury into gold. Patronized by a local nobleman, Trismosin continued these transmutational experiments until the nobleman died in a hurricane. Later Trismosin learned the secret of duplication. He apparently later went to a place \\"where kabbalistic and magical books in the Egyptian language were entrusted to me\\". He followed in a medieval Christian tradition of alchemists reporting their travels to the East, where they learned ancient and esoteric secrets of alchemy. Paracelsus records that he met Trismosin in Constantinople in 1520 and was instructed in the art of alchemy. Little else is known of their meeting, but Trismosin is best known today for his mentoring of Paracelsus. Trismosin is said to have been in possession of the panacea and, according to Hartmann, was last seen alive by a French traveller at the end of the 17th century. Work Aureum Vellus Aureum Vellus is a Latin collection of treatises on alchemy attributed to Trismosin. The earliest version of the book was printed in 1598 in Rorschach, Switzerland; it was translated into French by an \\"L. I\\" in 1612 as La Toyson d'Or and translated from French into English by William Backhouse as The Golden Fleece (Ashm. MS 1395). The collection contains the earliest printed edition of Splendor Solis (see below) along with a short autobiography of Trismosin (which is the source for much of Trismosin's life) among other treatises. The book popularized many concepts from the Rosarium Philosophorum in Europe. Splendor Solis Splendor Solis is an alchemical treatise. It was first printed in Aureum Vellus as part of a larger collection but is best known from a manuscript edition of . The manuscript consists of 100 pages of German text interspersed with 22 large allegorical illuminations. The illuminations are steeped in symbolism and their specific meanings are not known. Several are suspected to depict esoteric alchemical processes, possibly for the creation of the philosopher's stone.

Research  Stefan Koelsch's main fields of research include perception, attention, working memory, emotion, music therapy, and personality. Based on his research he concludes that the neural resources of music- and language-processing overlap strongly, and that activity in any brain structure that plays a causal role for emotions can be influenced by music. The latter has important implications for the therapeutic use of music, because numerous chronic somatic, psychiatric and neurological disorders and diseases are associated with functional abnormalities of these brain structures.

He also played non-league football for Moor Green, Kidderminster Harriers and Rushden & Diamonds. He played as a left back. Life and career Lilwall was born in Solihull. His uncle, Denis Thwaites, played professional football for Birmingham City in the 1960s. Lilwall played youth football for Silhill before joining Moor Green during the 1985‚Äì66 season. In 1987, he moved on to Kidderminster Harriers. Lilwall made his Conference debut in the 1989‚Äì90 season, and became a first-team regular during the following campaign. He helped Kidderminster reach the final of the 1990‚Äì91 FA Trophy, in which he created two chances for team-matesboth missedand drew a good save from Wycombe Wanderers' goalkeeper as Kidderminster lost 2‚Äì1. Lilwall remained with Kidderminster for a further season, taking his Conference appearance total to 65, and then became Osvaldo Ardiles' first signing as manager of Second Division (third-tier) club West Bromwich Albion for a fee of around ¬£70,000. He went straight into the Albion first team, and by September 1992 Premier League club Liverpool were reported to be \\"monitoring [his] progress\\". He was ever-present during his first season, and was a member of the team that gained promotion to the First Division via the play-offs, beating Port Vale 3‚Äì0 in the final after Vale had a man sent off. After Ardiles was replaced by Alan Buckley soon afterwards and Lilwall fell victim to a succession of injuries, he drifted out of first-team consideration. He left Albion at the end of the 1994‚Äì95 season, having made 73 appearances in Football League competition, and signed for Rushden & Diamonds of the Southern League. Injury also disrupted his time with Rushden & Diamonds. He contributed only seven Southern League games as his team won the 1995‚Äì96 Southern League title, and the following season played just four times in the 1996‚Äì97 Conference. In 1997, he rejoined Kidderminster Harriers, but appeared only infrequently for the first team, and ended his senior career back at Moor Green. Lilwall took a degree in Physical Education and Social Psychology at Coventry University, and also earned a diploma in Sports Psychology and the UEFA A Licence football coaching qualification.

The castle has belonged to the FitzGerald family for over 700 years and was the seat of the Knights of Glin.  History  The FitzGeralds first settled in the area in the 13th century, following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland, at the nearby Shanid Castle. Castle In the 14th century the Earl of Desmond elevated an illegitimate son to the hereditary knighthood of Glin. He built Glin Castle within the village of Glin, which became the permanent seat of the Knight of Glin. The castle was attacked during the Desmond Rebellions in the 16th century, the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the 17th century, the Jacobite risings and the Enforcement of the Penal Laws. In 1601 the castle was besieged by British troops and the knight's son was kidnapped. Georgian house By the late 17th century the castle had been abandoned and the FitzGerald family moved into a thatched longhouse adjacent to the castle. John Bateman FitzGerald, 23rd Knight of Glin married Margaretta Maria Fraunceis Gwyn in the 1780s and used her dowry to build a new home in the Georgian style. Later Neo-classical elements were added to the building. In 1923 a mob of Sinn F√©in members attacked the castle. In 1993 the FitzGeralds decided to turn the castle into a hotel to help pay for the upkeep. The hotel closed in 2008. In 2011 Desmond FitzGerald, 29th Knight of Glin died without a male heir. In 2015 the castle was put up for auction at Christie's by Lady FitzGerald. The castle did not sell in auction. In an effort to keep the castle in the family, it was purchased by Catherine FitzGerald, daughter of the last Knight of Glin, and her husband Dominic West. Today they run the castle as both a family home, and as a complete-let venue.

Sediment excavation and artefact documentation since 1860 confirm the idea of the arrival and permanent presence of European early modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic. The eponymous location represents the type site of the Aurignacian, the earliest known culture attributed to modern humans in western Eurasia. Assemblages of Aurignacian tool making tradition can be found in the cultural sediments of numerous sites from around 45,000 years BP to around 26,000 years BP. In recognition of its significance for various scientific fields and the 19th century pioneering work of √âdouard Lartet the Cave of Aurignac was officially declared a national Historic Monument of France by order of May 26, 1921. Location The Aurignac limestone grotto is located around northwest of the Aurignac commune on the southern side of the Rodes rivulet valley, a tributary of the Louge river on the northern slopes of the Pyrenees. History In 1852, several years before the advent of paleoanthropology as a scientific discipline, local worker Jean Baptist Bonnemaison searched the embankment and the platform in front of the cave out of curiosity, where he found some prehistoric tools. However, he also discovered seventeen human skeletons inside the cave, which had been closed in by a sandstone plate. These, reportedly, were quickly re-buried in the local parish cemetery upon the request of Dr. Amiel, the communal mayor at the time. Their age and origin remain unclear as they never underwent scientific examination and are now considered lost. Neither √âdouard Lartet in 1860 nor Fernand Lacorre in 1938 were able to locate the 1852 burial site. Pioneer paleontologist √âdouard Lartet lead the first excavation from 1860 to 1863 and recovered advanced tools, such as finely cut flints, struck from prepared core and variously worked bones and reindeer antlers, a great number of fossilized human bone and ceramic fragments, although the latter had confirmedly been buried during the Chalcolithic (around 6,000 to 4,000 years BP). Lartet started to search the area, that had contained the 17 skeletons and discovered the fossilized remains of several species of carnivores, such as the Cave hyena, Cave bear and Canis vulpus species, numerous herbivore species like mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, bison and reindeer, that are kept in the collections of the Mus√©e de l'Homme. At the very base in a thick black layer, that contained large quantities of ash and charcoal he unearthed characteristic sharpened flint tools and worked bones and antlers. Lartet concluded in his 1861 publication New Researches on the Coexistence of Man and of the Great Fossil Mammifers characteristic of the Last Geological Period, that these local early humans must have been contemporaries of the extinct animal species. From 1938 to 1939, Fernand Lacorre and his wife resumed the excavations and unearthed more large amounts of fossilized bones of over 30 species of animals. Stratigraphy Double edged scraper on blade During subsequent excavations an accurate sequence of three distinct stratae was established. * The lowest and oldest layer with dark sediments and artefacts attributed to early human occupation (about 35,000 years ago), during which time the site served as a shelter and permanent camp. Painting of a hand. Cave of Aurignac. Lartet, one of the first scholars to ever produce some form of prehistoric timeline in his documentation, developed his system primarily along the faunal fossil sequence. A method, that proved to be not popular and Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet's more serviceable system of Paleolithic chronology based on the evolution of human tool sets, was widely accepted during the following decades. However, the name Aurignacian in reference to the famous layer, mentioned above was only assigned during the early 20th century by Henri Breuil. * A central layer, which contained a great number of fossilized bones of herbivorous and carnivorous wildlife (after 35,000 years ago). * The remains and sediments of a common burial place, used during the Chalcolithic, that had been sealed by a sandstone slab and might have included the 17 individuals discovered in 1852 by Bonnemaison Later research Access to the site In 1961, a team under Louis Meroc successfully managed to dig at a site located from the first cave explored by Lartet. The new site, Aurignac 2, is characterized by the presence of large collapsed blocks. Tools found, are mainly careened scrapers, more rarely retouched blades and no chisels. They all come without exception from flint benches (deposits) less than to the east. Louis Meroc wrote in 1963: \\"The site of Aurignac 2 was inhabited before the collapse of the first cave, which was certainly only a small appendage of a much larger set of shelters. Based on the current state of knowledge, we assume, that the caves of Aurignac have, apart from the Aurignacian settlers, been unknown to later Paleolithic populations.\\" Objects found in the Cave of Aurignac, formerly preserved in the National Museum of Archeology and the Museum of Toulouse are now on display at the Museum Forum of the Aurignac in Aurignac town, which opened its doors to the public in October 2014.

She was also a noted educator and arts administrator. Early life and training Marsh attended private schools as a child. In the years following the end of World War I she studied as a design major in the School of Art at Cooper Union and later studied tapestry, weaving, and occupational therapy at the one of the schools run by the YWCA of New York. Having completed those studies she worked for the next four years, until 1925, as an instructor of occupational therapy. Career in art From 1935 to 1940 Marsh showed watercolors, oil paintings, and wood engravings in group exhibitions held at commercial galleries, including the Morton Montrose, and Contemporary Arts Galleries; and the Art Mart; as well as in shows staged by the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in its Argent Galleries. In April 1935 she had a solo exhibition at Contemporary Arts Galleries in Manhattan. She showed at the World's Fair held in New York in 1939 and, during the 1940s, showed watercolors, paintings, and prints in group exhibitions in diverse settings, including the 1940 Venice Biennale, Associated Artists of New Jersey, New York Society of Women Artists, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and National Academy of Design. Beginning in the mid-1950s Marsh devoted more time to work as an arts administrator, helping to transform an old grist mill near her home into an arts center and managing its exhibitions. In 1956 she chaired the first of an annual series of print exhibitions at the center, a tradition that would continue for the next 35 years. Over the course of her thirty-year career Marsh received awards from many art organizations including the New Jersey State Museum, Pen & Brush Club of New York, Philadelphia Print Club, Montclair Art Museum, and the National Association of Women Artists. Her work can be found in the permanent collections of Metropolitan Museum of Art, Philadelphia Art Museum, Brooklyn Museum, New Jersey State Museum and the Museum of Modern Art, Library of Congress, and New York Public Library. Artistic style and critical reception Anne Steele Marsh, Morning at the Circus, watercolor on paper, about 1936, 21 1/2 x 29 1/2 inches Anne Steele Marsh, Holland Tunnel, wood engraving, 1930, 9 x 12 inches Anne Steele Marsh, Intermission, wood engraving, 1951, 6 x 9 inches Anne Steele Marsh, In the Corner, oil on masonite, about 1962, 9 1/2 x 24 inches Marsh's style was realist. Her Watercolors, oil paintings, and wood engravings all drew critical notice. In 1935, Margaret Breuning, critic for the New York Post said her watercolors showed an \\"appreciation of the character of the medium, not only in their easy fluency of gay color but in their unpretentious simplicity and freedom.\\" At the same time Howard Devree of the New York Times wrote that her paintings resembled those of Hopper, Burchfield and Sanford Ross, but added that she was \\"preoccupied with the romantic, exciting, poetic and beautiful values in the commonplace\\" and said she captured them \\"sometimes rather dazzlingly‚Äîwith a joyous brush.\\" Reviewing a group show held in 1936 at the Art Mart, Howard Devree wrote that Marsh's \\"large and pleasing \\"Morning at the Circus\\" (shown at right) in particular deserves to be noticed by the visitor.\\" A Times review published in 1937 noted that she applied \\"wash smoothly and with clear definition.\\" The author said, \\"her color is pleasing and her work continues to gain facility.\\" That critic also called attention to a wood engraving called \\"Holland Tunnel\\" that Marsh had made in 1930, saying it was one of her more interesting works on paper. This print, shown at left, illustrates her early style. In 1943, reporting on a group show at the Studio Gallery, the critic for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, A. Z. Kreuze, said Marsh had a \\"sound facility\\" in wood engraving and praised one of her prints for its well managed distribution of light. In reviewing a group show held by the New York Society of Women Artists ten years later, Devree called attention to a wood engraving called \\"Intermission\\" (shown at right). In 1966 the New Jersey State Museum gave Marsh a purchase award for \\"In the Corner,\\" an oil painting of about 1962 (shown at left). A critic noted at the time that she competed against \\"far more celebrated names\\" in winning the award. In 1995, looking back on her artistic career, a critic said \\"her wood engravings combine powerful design with painstakingly refined execution.\\" Career as educator After completing study at the YMCA, Marsh taught occupational therapy four years during the early 1920s. From 1938 to 1945 she was an art instructor at Buxton Country Day School in Short Hills, New Jersey, and at Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts. Career as administrator In 1941 Marsh founded and became first president of Associated Artists of New Jersey Limited to a membership of fifty, the group staged exhibitions in galleries and museums and sponsored public forums. In 1952 Marsh and her husband helped to create a center for arts and crafts in Clinton, New Jersey. They bought and converted a former a grist mill into exhibition space, studios, and a shop. Marsh organized exhibitions and managed the gallery at the center. In 1956 she began a series of annual print exhibitions and started a program to purchase prints for what would later become known as the Anne Steele Marsh Collection. She also set up and ran a commercial gallery, called the Graphics Room, in the center. During her career she served as trustee of American Association of Museums and the New Jersey State Museum and was a board member of New York Society of Women Artists, Society of American Graphic Artists, and other arts organizations. For her work she received a commendation from the New Jersey legislature. Personal life and family Born on September 7, 1901, Marsh was the daughter of the well-known illustrator Frederic Dorr Steele (1873-1944) and his wife Mary Thyng Steele (known as Polly, 1874-1957). She had two siblings, Robert G. Steele (born 1906) and Zulma R. Steel (1910-2001). In 1925 she married James Randall Marsh (1896-1965) After the wedding the couple moved to Essex Fells, New Jersey. In 1948 they moved to bought a farm in Pittstown, New Jersey. They converted its barn to a studio, where Anne Steele Marsh would work, and music room, where the family would host Sunday afternoon chamber music concerts. James R. Marsh was the son of the illustrator and muralist Frederick Dana Marsh (1872-1961) and his wife, the miniaturist, Alice Randall Marsh (1869-1929). The artist Reginald Marsh was his brother. He was an artist in his own right but is better known as a designer and manufacturer of decorative wrought iron. Established in 1926, his firm, the James R. Marsh Company, made small products like sconces and table lamps, as well as large ones like the entrance gate at Sarah Lawrence College. He also was Anne Steele Marsh's partner in transforming the Clinton gristmill into the Hunterdon Art Center, now called the Hunterdon Museum of Art. In 1962 he helped to establish the Clinton Historical Museum. Anne Steele Marsh and James R. Marsh had two sons, Reginald Steele Marsh (1926-2017) and Peter Marsh (born 1932). They had one daughter Janet B. Marsh (born 1930). Peter Marsh was a professional violinist.

Location South Kilburn is within the London Borough of Brent, to the east/southeast of Queens Park tube station, immediately south of Kilburn Park tube station, north of Maida Hill, and to the west of the Paddington Recreation Ground. Carlton Vale is the numbered street that separates the northern and southern parts of the estate. Redevelopment In 2014 a massive redevelopment project was started by the London Borough of Brent to redevelop the estate, starting with the demolition of two of the 18-storey housing blocks on the estate. This has continued with the creation of new housing blocks built to modern design quality and energy efficiency standards and owned by several different housing associations along with infill developments owned by the local council. Per the plans for this regeneration scheme, the redevelopment so far has seen a net loss of social housing units as most of the new blocks replacing the demolished buildings include a number of flats for social rent (\\"council housing\\") along with flats for sale on the private market. The Gloucester House and Durham Court section of the regeneration, begun by Telford Homes housing association in 2017, will see the demolition of 209 flats and their replacement with 235 new-build units, nearly half of which (133) will be for private sale. The construction of market-rate flats for sale has made the area popular with real estate investors and home-buyers who see the area's central location and numerous transport links as attractive features. In May 2019, inhabitants of the newly built Merle Court (opened in 2012) were forced to move due to design problems in the building. Several months later the mandatory balloting procedure of residents for Phase 2 of the South Kilburn redevelopment scheme was met with a campaign by some local residents to extend the ballot to all 8,000 residents, many of whom, in anticipation of future demolition, are settled on the estate as residents in temporary accommodation, and who, Brent Council argues, do not need to be included under the Greater London Authority's rules on estate regeneration balloting. Problems with crime William Dunbar House South Kilburn has long been plagued by crime, the streets and blocks that characterise the dense sprawl of housing being the sight of numerous shootings and a drug trade controlled by various gangs, including the notorious ¬£R. The gangs of South Kilburn have been known to have an ongoing rivalry with gangs from the nearby Mozart Estate, which has resulted in numerous shootings, stabbings and kidnappings. The rivalry has been reported to be a typical \\"postcode war\\",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- england-london-15126415 as South Kilburn is part of NW6 while Mozart Estate is in W9 and in the City of Westminster. 2007 raid On 18 April 2007, 500 police, including firearms officers, raided the estate in a series of dawn raids after a months-long sting operation where members of a gang known as F.A.C. (Fire Arms Cartel) had been selling guns to undercover police officers. Numerous arrests were made resulting in prosecutions with claims that the police had 'smashed' an 'untouchable gang'. Although crime levels subsequently fell to some extent, there were similar raids in 2011 when 250 police officers once again stormed South Kilburn Estate in a co-ordinated drugs raid. The gang rivalry between South Kilburn and Mozart Estate has continued with numerous gang fights as well as the shooting of innocent victim Daniel Omari Smith, gunned down in 2010 in a KFC in a case of mistaken identity. In 2013, mother of one Sabrina Moss, was killed in a takeaway shop on Kilburn High Road while celebrating her 24th birthday when she was hit by bullets from a MAC-10 submachine gun, intended for South Kilburn gang members from the F.A.C. gang who were also in the takeaway. Her friend as well as two South Kilburn gang members were also hit by bullets and injured in the attack which was perpetrated by members of the Kensal Green Boys gang who were involved in a long-running feud with gangs from South Kilburn Estate. Mohanna Abdhou murder In May 2017, Mohanna Abdhou, a 20-year-old woman, was shot and killed while hanging out with friends on South Kilburn Estate outside Dickens House. The intended targets were probably a group of young men from the estate who managed to escape being shot while Mohanna, who had no involvement with gangs, was tragically hit by a bullet in the stomach and died. Once again, this killing was connected by police and prosecutors to the tit for tat violence between local gangs in and around the area. The gang war between Mozart Estate and South Kilburn Estate continues despite community and local government action. The area continues to be effected by its history of gang violence and drug dealing. Housing corruption A scheme started by the South Kilburn Partnership to redevelop the estate, was accused of corruption in 2010 when ¬£50million allocated for the estate's redevelopment went missing. In popular culture A photo taken from a 16th floor flat in the estate, showing adjacent expensive terraced houses on Kilburn Park Road South Kilburn features as a setting in award-winning author Zadie Smith's novel White Teeth. It is also featured in a short story published in Vice, titled \\"The Rape of Dina\\", recounting the true story of a murder which took place on the estate.

Early Career  Born into a peasant family in modern-day Latvia, Jan Sten joined the Bolsheviks as a teenager, in 1914, shortly before taking up a place a teachers' seminary in Valmiera. In 1917, when Latvia was overrun by the German army, he was evacuated to Syzran After graduating, in 1919, he fought in the Russian Civil War. In 1921, he was one of the original batch of students enrolled in the Institute of Red Professors, and graduated form its philosophy department in 1924, after which he taught at Moscow State University and served on the editorial board of the magazine Under the Banner of Marxism. From 1924 to 1927, he was head of the propaganda department of Comintern. He was a member of the Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; from 1927 to 1928, he was deputy head of the propaganda department of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From 1928 to 1930, he was Deputy Director of the Marx-Engels Institute.  Stalin's Tutor  According to Yeveny Frolov, an Old Bolshevik who survived Stalin's purges:  Arrest and Execution  It can be assumed that Jan Sten privately sided with Nikolai Bukharin in his opposition to the campaign to force the Soviet Union's rural population onto collective farms. Although he did not express his opposition openly, he was dismissed from his posts in 1930. He then joined the conspiratorial group led by Martemyan Ryutin who plotted to remove Stalin from office, and was openly calling for \\"the liquidation of Stalin and his clique\\". He was also a member of a secret oppositional group which included Sergey Syrtsov and Vissaron Lominadze, this group later joined a larger oppositional bloc in which Leon Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev were members. This bloc was most likely dissolved in early 1933. He was arrested in October 1932, held for two months in Butyrka prison, then deport to Akmolinsk, in Kazakhstan. He was permitted to return to Moscow in 1934, after making an admission of error, and was employed on the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. He was re-arrested on 3 August 1936, and during the first of the Moscow Show Trials on 20 August, the lead defendant, Grigory Zinoviev named him as one of the conspirators who had been plotting against Stalin. He was shot on 20 June 1937.  Personality  Bukharin's widow, Anna Larina, described Sten as \\"an independent-minded party man who always looked down on Stalin from a position of superior intellect\\" adding \\"There was something majestic in the proud bearing of this Latvian with his expressive, intelligent face, Socratic brow, and shock of white hair.\\" Jan Sten was posthumously rehabilitated in August 1988.

The galaxy was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on March 15, 1784 and is a member of the Virgo Cluster. NGC 4294 appears to be undergoing ram-pressure striping edge-on. Physical characteristics NGC 4294 hosts many H II regions. Interaction with NGC 4299 NGC 4294 appears to be in a pair with NGC 4299 and may be possibly tidally interacting. Effects of a tidal interaction on NGC 4294 are evident as the galaxy has a disturbed optical and HI morphology, a high global star formation rate, and has an observed asymmetry in polarized radio continuum emission. HI tail Chung et al. identified that NGC 4294 has a one sided tail of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI). The tail points to the southwest and appears to be a result of ram-pressure. The tail has no optical counterpart and is oriented parallel to the HI tail found in NGC 4299. As the tail has no optical counterpart, this makes the probability of the tail being caused by tidal interaction low. However, NGC 4299 lies from NGC 4294 and the two galaxies have almost the same velocity, with a difference of 120 km/s. This means that the scenario of the tail originating from a tidal interaction cannot be ruled out entirely. Black Hole NGC 4294 may harbor an intermediate-mass black hole with an estimated mass ranging from 3,000 (3*10^3) to 20,000 (2*10^4) solar masses.

It is native to shallow waters on the Pacific coast of North and South America. This worm was first described in 1828 by the British zoologist John Edward Gray as Themiste hennahi, the type specimen having been collected by the Rev. W. Hennah, with the type locality being Peru. Description The body of this worm is cylindrical. The introvert (the retractable anterior part of the worm) is tipped by a crown-like structure of six branching tentacles which surround the mouth. The collar (immediately behind the tentacles) is not reddish-purple as it is in Themiste dyscrita, and the introvert is devoid of spines. Distribution and habitat Themiste hennahi is native to the tropical and subtropical eastern Pacific Ocean, its range including the western coast of the United States, and the coasts of Peru and Chile. It burrows into sandy, gravelly, silty and muddy substrates in the intertidal zone, including eelgrass beds, and conceals itself under loose rocks. Ecology This worm often lives in a burrow or other low-oxygen environment, extending its introvert into the water column to feed. The skin of the trunk is thick and unsuitable as a respiratory surface. Research has shown that the tentacular crown is the main respiratory surface, leading to this worm being described as a \\"tentacle breather\\". Oxygen diffuses into the fluid inside the tentacular system where it is taken up by the pigment hemerythrin in the blood cells. The oxygen further diffuses through an elaborate septum into the coelomic cavity where it is retained because there is a greater capacity for oxygen in the coelom than in the tentacular cavity. This respiratory system makes the worm resistant to a lack of oxygen as it can call on the oxygen already bound to the hemerythrin when the oxygen in its environment is insufficient.

He became the first person to land a plane in Tajikistan, doing so in the midst of the Basmachi revolt in 1924. During the Second World War he served as a flight commander in a special-purpose transport unit until he died in the line of duty in 1942 after being shot down by German anti-aircraft guns. Background Akhriev was born in 1893 to an Ingush family in Furtoug within the Russian Empire. His father, Chakh Akhriev, was a famous historian and ethnographer. In 1914 Rashid-bek Akhriev entered the Tiflis Military School in Georgia and graduated from the Gatchina Aviation School. He was subsequently wounded twice during the first world war. Career in Soviet aviation After joining the Red Army in 1923 he was sent to Central Asia to assist in the development of aviation in the region. The Soviet government had purchased eight Junkers U-13 from Germany for use by the branch of Dobrolyot based in Central Asia. The U-13s were disassembled, shipped by rail to Tashkent, and then reassembled. In August 1924 Akhriev piloted the maiden flight of the Tashkent-Bukhara route. Shortly thereafter he and flight engineer Pyotr Komarov flew the maiden flight of the Bukhara-Dushanbe route, which was also the first time an airplane landed in Tajikistan. The aircraft flying the route was armed with two rifles and hand grenades, due to the risk of the plane being shot down and attacked by Basmachi rebels in the area. The plane was not attacked and made a successful landing in Dushanbe on 3 September 1924. The anniversary of the historic flight is celebrated annually in by people in Tajikistan's aviation industry after the date was officially declared the Day of Aviation of the Republic of Tajikistan in 1994. In 1927 Akhriev was transferred to the Kharkiv directorate in the Ukrainian Division of the Civil Air Fleet, where he flew the Kharkiv-Moscow, Kharkiv-Kiev, and Kharkiv-Rostov routes. During his career he worked with some of the USSR's most famed pilots, including Mikhail Gromov, Mavriky Slepnyov, and Mikhail Vodopyanov. He remained in the Ukrainian Division of the Civil Air Fleet until 1941. World War II After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Akhriev volunteered to serve on the warfront and was deployed as part of a special- purpose aviation unit under the command of Shalva Chankotadze. The squadron he was assigned to carried out deliveries of ammunition and food to besieged Leningrad from Moscow. He completed dozens of combat mission before he was killed in action on 20 January 1942. On that day he was leading a flight of three aircraft over enemy territory; Akhriev and another one of the planes were shot down by German anti-aircraft guns when they tried to attack a strategically important bridge. After the blockade of Leningrad ended in 1944 the remains of Akhriev and the other pilots were found and buried with full military honors in the village near Arbuzovo.

She was known for battling ovarian cancer throughout her modeling career, and was often photographed with surgical scars and a bald head from chemotherapy. Early life Mayday was born Ashley Shandrel Luther on April 15, 1988, and grew up on a farm near Aylesbury, Saskatchewan (population 50). She grew up with three brothers; her family grew crops, raised cattle, horses, pigs and chickens, and ran a local restaurant. Her mother was an artist. Mayday went to boarding school at age 13, then studied gender studies and psychology at university, and afterwards took a room with her brother in Vancouver. Modeling career Mayday in A Perfect 14 When she was 23 years old, Mayday was working as a flight attendant for Sunwing Airlines, which took her to routes including Cuba, Mexico, and Jamaica. She was also trying to work as a model. She adopted her stage name, Elly Mayday, as a combination of Elly May Clampett, a character from The Beverly Hillbillies, and her aviation career. She was told she was not tall or thin enough for traditional modeling, but that her 34-29-44 measurements were ideal for pin-up modeling; she won a contest for a local auto show, and was the main subject of an award-winning documentary chronicling her cancer and modeling career called A Perfect 14, referring to her clothing size. Mayday began feeling symptoms which she would describe as excruciating lower back and abdomen pain, accompanied by pressure in her lower stomach, recurring bladder infections, and a constant feeling of being unwell. She went to the emergency room four times. Doctors did not consider cancer because of her age; instead, she said, they told her that her symptoms were a result of her weight, and advised her to exercise and strengthen her core. She lost , but her pain did not go away. Mayday's continued attempts at modeling succeeded, and by early 2013 she became a model for Forever Yours, a Vancouver all-sizes lingerie company. Her symptoms increased in the summer of 2013, and she returned to her doctors saying that she would refuse to work until she was diagnosed. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, specifically stage III low-grade serous carcinoma, a rare form of cancer normally seen in older women. She was 25 years old. Mayday had four surgeries, including a hysterectomy, which left scars, and three months of chemotherapy which left her bald. She continued to model, and decided to embrace her baldness and scars as an opportunity to talk about her cancer. Sonya Perkins, the owner of Forever Yours, was hesitant at first, but says the campaign was a success. Photos of Mayday with a bald head and surgery scars gained her tens of thousands of followers on Facebook. She also landed an international modeling contract with Jaclyn Sarka, founder of JAG Models in New York City, who had seen her photos on Instagram before hearing about her cancer diagnosis. She was originally called a plus-size model by industry standards, a label which she rejected, saying that she embraced her size 14 body, and was normal size. Over the year and a half course of her cancer treatment, Mayday lost , down to and size 10, which she says caused \\"skinny shaming\\" on social media. Some of her former fans or friends accused her of using her cancer to make money and become famous. In July 2014, Mayday was told she was cancer free. She flew to Australia to front a campaign for the Australian Women's Weekly, and was one of six models featured in plus-size lingerie company Lane Bryant's #ImNoAngel campaign in April 2015, displaying women with model-atypical body types. Her unretouched surgery scars were visible in the photographs. In June 2015, Mayday's cancer returned, and she had a fifth surgery to remove another tumor. She posted pictures from this surgery to Instagram as well, referring to her scars as \\"beauty marks\\" but she stopped referring to herself as cancer free. Mayday kept modeling in New York until 2017, when her disease recurred, and she returned to Canada. In 2017, Mayday was the face of Canadian plus-size clothing store Addition Elle's campaign to raise money for Ovarian Cancer Canada. She posted about the difficult parts of her treatments on Instagram, including pictures of her exhausted, and videos of her talking about vomiting and undergoing chemotherapy. In 2018, she wrote an article for Flare magazine about her hysterectomy making her unable to have children. It was the first of her major operations. She had planned on eventually having five children, and when she was diagnosed consulted a fertility specialist about collecting her eggs, but was told that the drugs used would increase the progression of her cancer, so she decided against it. \\"I need to take care of the young girls that need me or need this voice. That's my way of parenting for now,\\" she told the CBC. Death Mayday died in Vancouver on March 1, 2019, aged 30. Her disease had progressed, especially during the last months, and the doctors were unable to help any more. A high school friend who flew in to see her said that Mayday had accepted death. At the time of her death, Mayday's Facebook page had 500,000 followers.

CarWoo, whose logo also appears as CarWoo!, was a competitor to TrueCar, which was a similar but negotiation-free car buying platform.  Operations  Carwoo was an anonymous automobile marketplace that enabled its users to purchase cars without providing personal information to dealers until after an offer was made and accepted. Once a buyer accepted an offer, their information was transferred to the dealer. Rather than buyers bidding up the price, salespeople bid the selling price lower.  History  CarWoo was founded in Burlingame, California by Tommy McClung, a serial entrepreneur who previously co-founded IMSafer. They received seed money and advice from Y Combinator. On October 13, 2010 the firm launched their marketplace and received a Series A round of financing, $6 Million, led by Interwest Partners, Comcast Interactive Capital, Blumberg Capital, Accelerator Ventures, Raymond Tonsing and Dillon McDonald. In 2011, the firm received a Series B round of funding in the amount of $6 million, mostly from the same investors. By the end of 2011, their network included 11,000 car dealerships. By July 2012, this figure grew to over 13,000. In 2013 McClung announced CarWoo needed at least an additional $50 million to sustain their growth rate and remain in business.

Jefferson (1908-2002) was an American artist.  Education  After attending public schools in Washington DC, Jefferson began her artistic education taking lessons at Howard University before moving to New York City in 1935. She attended Hunter College, which in the first half of the 20th century had the third highest enrollment of African American women in United States colleges and universities that were not dedicated solely to African American Studies. While there, she studied art composition, design, and lithography. From Hunter, Jefferson moved on to study graphic arts and printing practices at Columbia University.  Artistic career  Following her studies at Columbia University, Jefferson began her artistic career designing posters for the YWCA (Young Women's Christian Association) in New York City, and found freelance work for Friendship Press. By 1942, she was the publishing company's artistic director, overseeing all aspects of its book productions. She was the first African American to hold a director's position in the publishing industry. Jefferson additionally did freelance work for the major publishing companies Doubleday, Macmillan, and Viking, as well as the academic presses of Columbia University, Oxford University, Rutgers University, and Syracuse University. Jefferson designed illustrations of black and white children for the songbook We Sing America. In 1936, then governor of Georgia, Eugene Talmadge, ordered copies of the songbook burned. Her lithographs were exhibited in museums around the country under the auspices of the Harmon Foundation, an organization known for supporting and exhibiting the works of African Americans from the 1920s until the 1960s. In 1960, Jefferson retired from Friendship Press. She would, however, continue to produce work, designing book jacket covers and maps for universities and publishing companies, as well as publicity materials for the 23rd and 26th annual National Urban League Beaux Art Balls, held respectively in 1963 and 1966 at The Waldorf Astoria hotel. Following her retirement, Jefferson embarked on five trips to Africa, where she documented her travels in both illustration and photography. In 1974, The Decorative Arts of Africa was published, which documents her research, photographs, and drawings of her visits to Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, and Zimbabwe; it contains over three hundred of her illustrations. Jefferson kept an art studio in Litchfield, CT during her later years. Personal life Louise E. Jefferson was born in Washington, DC as an only child to parents Louise and Paul Jefferson. Her father, a calligrapher for the United States Treasury Department, encouraged her to draw as a child. She studied art in New York City, where she was active in the African American art scene in Harlem being credited as a founding member of the Harlem Artists Guild. Other notable members of the guild included Augusta Savage, Aaron Douglas, Selma Burke, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Jacob Lawrence. Jefferson was friends with poet and author Langston Hughes, and shared an apartment with civil rights activist Pauli Murray. Jefferson struggled financially in her early New York years before earning a full-time position at Friendship Press, the publishing branch of the National Council of Churches. After Jefferson's retirement from Friendship Press in 1960, she made several trips to Africa, eventually publishing her book The Decorative Arts of Africa in 1974. Jefferson's later years were spent in Litchfield, Connecticut, where she occupied the last few years of her life gardening and entertaining friends. She died in Litchfield in 2002, at the age of 93. Selected Works and Collections  The Amistad Research Center Collection  In 2002 the estate of Louise E. Jefferson was gifted to The Amistad Research Center, which is an open research facility in New Orleans, Louisiana dedicated to the records of African Americans and other underrepresented communities. The collection includes a myriad of Jefferson's works, including drawings and designs, a vast collection of photography and negatives, and other ephemera.

Just one year after being founded, in 1888, a high school curriculum was added. By 1892 the Allen School became a boarding school primarily for Black female students, although boys continued to attend until 1941. Known for its high academic standards, the school became an accredited high school in 1924, and in 1940 was admitted as a member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, a distinction received by only two high schools for Black students in the 17 counties making up western North Carolina. By this time, the focus of the Allen School had shifted to college preparatory work and the grade school had been dropped. Thereafter, the school was known as an all-girls boarding high school, with about two-thirds of students coming from Western North Carolina and the rest from other states in the country, as well as outside the United States.  Educational mission  The Allen School, which employed mostly white female teachers who were missionaries, emphasized ‚ÄúChristian ideals.‚Äù According to Jamie Butcher, the ‚ÄúReligious centering of the school ebbed and flowed according to church policy and the religious climate of the time.‚Äù But the school retained a focus on ‚ÄúChristian ideals‚Äù and was connected to Berry Temple Methodist Church, also located in the Asheville, North Carolina. In addition to its dedication to Christian ideals, the Allen School had a threefold mission centered on the ‚Äúindustrial, mental, and physical.‚Äù Industrial refers to vocational training provided to students, which revolved around the training of teachers, but also included classes related to domestic tasks, such as cooking and sewing. While the value of an industrial education for Black students was certainly debated, notably between Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois, the Allen School Allen School did function as a normal school. But it also offered a variety of classes, including ones related to religion, business, music, the sciences, and foreign languages. As a result of its high academic standards and focus on college preparation, by the 1950s, approximately 50% of Allen School graduates attended college, including Wellesley and Vassar. And by 1972, two years before the school closed, more than 75% of the graduates went on to attend four-year colleges.  Closure  The Allen School closed on June 3, 1974. By the fall of 1965, high schools in Western North Carolina were desegregating. As a result, the Allen School had difficulty surviving financially. According to then principal, Ruth Walter, ‚ÄúWe just couldn‚Äôt charge the tuition we needed to keep the school running.‚Äù The year it closed, the Allen School graduated 10 girls, which brought the total number of graduates from the school to 1,177.

As journalist for La Repubblica, she reported on contemporary cinema and conducted interviews with many famous Italian and international directors and actors, including a 1998 behind-the-scenes reportage on Stanley Kubrick. Life and career Fusco was born in Rome on July 8, 1939. Her father was a policeman. As a sort of rebellion, Fusco went to London and, in 1972, began her career in film co-scripting Bluebeard - the first of a number of initially mostly erotic films that she wrote or co-wrote. In the meantime, Fusco started working as journalist for La Repubblica, which had only been founded recently. For at least three decades, she followed the film festivals of Cannes, Venice, Berlin, London, Marrakesh and others, conducting interviews with Italian directors including Federico Fellini, Pietro Germi, Ermanno Olmi, Giuseppe Bertolucci and Nanni Moretti, as well as younger filmmakers - many of whom her friends - and international stars such as Sean Connery and Roman Polanski. With the latter, she was to work on a script shortly before the incident in which Sharon Tate was murdered. Through her friendship with Ken Adam, Fusco also managed to enter Stanley Kubrick's mansion to report behind the scenes in an article published on July 23, 1998. According to Anna Bandettini, it was her masterpiece, representing her way of reporting on cinema not in an abstract way, but on its stories and lives.

She teaches the law and economics of public choice to undergraduate and graduate students. The aim of her research, for more than two decades, has been the law and economic analysis of legal institutions including culture ‚Äì she investigated how the social order is achieved through social norms that are embodied in ethnic commerce networks and the exchange of gifts. She published numerous research papers on the trust, ethnicity and identity of Chinese merchants in Southeast Asia, which have been the central theme of her work on the \\"economy of identity.\\" Landa‚Äôs work had been praised as an important contribution to the new institutional economics literature by Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics. Landa is also the founder and chief editor of Bioeconomics Journal, an international research journal that integrates biology into economics, a journal she launched in 1999 at Kluwer Academic Publishers and now published by Springer.  Economic philosophy  Economics often assumes an impersonal market, and the specific identity of buyers and sellers is not related to transactions, but is this really the case? Janet Tai Landa‚Äôs researches aims to evolve around the core question: How does specific identity of buyers and sellers are related to transactions in economics. As early as 1978, Janet Tai Landa published her thesis, The economics of the ethnically homogeneous middleman group: A property rights-public choice approach , at the Polytechnic University of Virginia, in which she had integrated the following factors: identity, trust, clan, religion, and symbols. Her papers were then published in the Journal of Legal Studies in 1981 and 1983, respectively. In both papers, she used the economic models to express her own thoughts. In general, Landa notes that real-life transactions are full of risks, and if two parties cannot negotiate to guarantee the performance of the contract, it would very inefficient. In her paper, she sees buyers and sellers as economic clubs ‚Äî expanding the size of the club will bring more trading opportunities, but it will also increase the difficulty of supervision. However, the emergence of identity and clan can solve this problem. As Landa pointed out: on the one hand, the meaning of identity is that everyone can identify this person, understand his/her history, and assess his/her probability of default. In this sense, identity carries a reputation; on the other hand, individuals with the same identity form a group, and transactions take place within the group. She is particularly concerned about the Chinese business associations in Southeast Asia. The way they do business is exactly the opposite of economic assumptions ‚Äì which is highly dependent on personal identity. This is not a unique phenomenon of the Chinese, according to her studies, the medieval Medici family, the Jews have history to differentiating buyers and sellers according to identities. For example, Jewish businessmen active in New York and Antwerp have monopolized the worldwide diamond business as their business activities are strictly limited to Jewish interior network. Even though Jews are scattered around the world, their faith in the Jewish tradition of rituals has never changed. One of the cases that Janet chose was the Fujian Gang in Southeast Asia, which mainly engaged in rubber intermediary business. Fujian Gang is organized geographically, and the interior is quite united. They do business without relying on a formal system, but rely on the credibility of the group. Many large businesses are finalized on the phone, and the contract is signed afterwards. In fact, if the two sides agree this week, they will pay a batch of goods next Monday; even if the rubber price has fluctuated greatly on Monday, everyone will still follow the oral agreement. Despite the volatility of the rubber market, merchants are sometimes tempted to default, and they value more of their reputation. Landa further extends these theories to religious issues. In the study published in 1983, she clarified two important aspects of religion: firstly, religion itself is also shared within a club. Many famous trade groups in history rely on religion to organize. Trading requires a high degree of trust, and the scale is too large to guarantee effective supervision; secondly, some religions often require behaviours that are difficult for others to understand such as dietary taboos, abstinence, etc., Landa believes that this is to raise the cost of enjoying club ‚Äúdiscounts‚Äù and to filter people who only want to take advantage. In the same article, Landa believes that symbols may play a similar role as identity. Group members reduce the cost of identifying each other through specific decorations, tags, flags, and the like. For people outside the group, these symbols may be completely meaningless; but people within the group can fully understand. In her 1999 article , Janet Tai Landa draws on some of the key concepts of the new institutional economy, as well as the modern literature of evolutionary biology. She gives an explanation of the Chinese diaspora's dominance in market functions in the Southeast Asian economies. The success of Chinese merchants has provoked envy and hatred by local peoples, leading to episodes of racial violence against the Chinese. In order to understand the economic underpinnings of inter-ethnic conflict and violence, says Landa, it is necessary to understand the economic underpinnings of the success of Chinese merchants in Southeast Asia. Her article presents an economic theory of Chinese merchants, which suggests that the Confucian code of ethics emphasizes the importance of mutual help, reciprocal help between parents, colleagues and villagers speaking the same dialect. This allowed the formation of ‚Äúclub-like‚Äù organizational arrangements consisting of homogeneous members of merchants providing themselves with infrastructure essential or profit- making entrepreneurship. Thus the Chinese club-integrated merchants were able to benefit from lower transaction cost, which gave them a significant differential advantage in competing with other market-oriented ethnic groups. The EHMG (Ethically Homogeneous Middleman Group) club also functions as a unit of cultural transmission by leaving Confucian ethics to future generations of Chinese merchants, hence maintaining the Chinese merchant's vocation over time. In short, it turns out that the theory that Janet Tai Landa abstracted from the business gang 40 years ago is surprisingly forward-looking ‚Äî the analysis of trust, reputation and business groups is quite similar to Greif's series of classic studies; Analyzing the optimal size and entry threshold using religious, and it is also very consistent with Iannaccone's classic analysis of religion in 1992.  Published books   Trust, Ethnicity, and Identity (1994)  Trust, Ethnicity, and Identity deals with the economic role of laws and institutions in achieving social order in a decentralized economy. This book mainly examines how ethnic kin-based trading networks can rely on trust when a well-developed framework of contract laws is missing. Specifically, this book considers the coordinating role of three major nonprice institutions‚Äîethnic trading networks, contract law, and gift- exchange‚Äîin economizing on transaction costs and thus facilitating the process of exchange in decentralized economies in different historical contexts. The major unifying theme of the book is this: identity matters when traders operate in an environment characterized by contract uncertainty, where the legal framework for the enforcement of contracts is not well developed. This in turn points out the importance of trust embedded in particularistic exchange relations such as kinship or ethnicity. One unique facet of this book is that the author uses a property rights‚Äîpublic choice approach‚Äîpart of the New Institutional Economics‚Äîto provide a unifying theoretical framework to explain such diverse exchange institutions as contract law, ethnic trading networks, and gift-exchange, In addition, it goes beyond the New Institutional Economics paradigm by incorporating some crucial concepts from sociology, anthropology, and bioeconomics, such as social structure, social norms, culture, reciprocity, and kin-related altruism. This broad interdisciplinary framework gives Landa's work a relevance beyond economics to law, political science, sociology, anthropology, and bioeconomics.  Economic Success of Chinese Merchants in Southeast Asia (2015)  This book analyzes the economic achievements of overseas Chinese businessmen in Southeast Asia: China's homogenous group of Chinese homogenous groups is an informal low-cost organization that provides contract merchandise and other club products, which is crucial for the success of businessmen. Landa's theory - and the various extensions that emphasize kinship and other trust relationships - draw on economics and other social sciences and go beyond evolutionary biology. Her empirical material forms the basis for the development of her unique, integrated and interdisciplinary theoretical framework and has important policy implications for understanding ethnic conflicts in multi-ethnic societies where minority groups dominate the role of merchants.

Caroline Sturgis was born in Boston, Massachusetts to the former Elizabeth Marsten Davis Sturgis (1789-1864), the second daughter of Judge John Davis, a U.S. District Judge for the District of Massachusetts, and William F. Sturgis (1782-1863), a former sea captain who rose to become one of the wealthiest and most successful merchants in Boston. Known for her friendships and frequent correspondences with prominent American Transcendentalists, such as Margaret Fuller and Ralph Waldo Emerson, Sturgis published 25 poems in four different volumes of The Dial, a Transcendental periodical. She also wrote and illustrated two books for children, Rainbows for Children (1847) and The Magician‚Äôs Show Box, and Other Stories (1856). Bowing to the dictates of her class and its restrictions on gender, Sturgis did not reveal her authorship of these two books, attributing them instead to her friend Lydia Maria Child.Houghton Library, Sturgis-Tappan Papers. She attended Bronson Alcott's Temple School, Dorothy Dix's school for girls, became Margaret Fuller's private student, and she participated in Fuller's Conversations series with her sister Ellen Sturgis Hooper (1812-1848). Recent research has shown that Sturgis had a greater influence on Transcendentalist thought than previously acknowledged, particularly on Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose journals and poems provide evidence of his deep respect for her. Biography Caroline Sturgis was a middle child of Captain William and Elizabeth Sturgis, who had six children, William Watson (1810-1827), Ellen (1812-1848), Anne (1813-1884), Caroline (1818-1888), Mary Louisa (1820-1870), and Susan (1825-1853).Sturgis family Bible, Sturgis Papers, Sturgis Library, Barnstable. William Watson, first-born son and his father‚Äôs beloved namesake, was killed at sixteen in a boating accident of the coast of Provincetown in 1827, when the boom of the boat suddenly gibed, hitting him in the head.Sturgis family Bible, Sturgis Papers, Sturgis Library, Barnstable. William and Elizabeth lived separately for a period after the accident, and although Elizabeth eventually returned to live with her husband, the family never recovered from this tragedy. Margaret Fuller formally introduced Sturgis to Emerson in the winter of 1837, during his course of lectures on Human Culture at Boston‚Äôs Masonic Temple. Emerson knew her father from his time working as a minister in Boston and in previous visits to the Sturgis family, so he likely knew Caroline Sturgis when she was a child. Emerson and his then fianc√©e Lydia Jackson were honored at a party at the Sturgis home on March 5, 1835, following Emerson‚Äôs lecture on Burke at Boston‚Äôs Masonic Temple, the sixth in his series on biography given for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.Carpenter, Delores Bird, ed. (1987). The Selected Letters of Lidian Jackson Emerson. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, p. 24.Charvat, William (1961). Emerson‚Äôs American Lecture Engagements: A Chronological List. New York: New York Public Library, p. 15. The friendship between Emerson and Sturgis grew following her sojourn with the Emersons at their house in Concord, Massachusetts, in June 1839, a visit that was followed by many others.Tilton, Eleanor M. (1990). The Letters of Ralph Waldo Emerson, New York: Columbia University Press, v. 7: 345. Their correspondence extended their face to face conversations on philosophy and literature, including on such works as Bettina von Arnim's Goethe's Correspondence with a Child. Sturgis began as Margaret Fuller‚Äôs student, and later became her primary confidante. Together they traveled to secluded destinations to write, draw, and think. Sturgis was a catalyst for many of Fuller‚Äôs ideas about art, women, mysticism, and more. Both women loved one another in a romantic friendship similar to what Carroll Smith-Rosenberg describes in ‚ÄúThe Female World of Love and Ritual.‚Äù Sturgis joined Fuller for her extended stay at Fishkill Landing, New York from October through November 1844, during which time Fuller turned her 1843 Dial essay ‚ÄúThe Great Lawsuit. Man versus Men. Woman versus Women‚Äù into her important feminist work Woman in the Nineteenth Century (1845). Sturgis spent the summer of 1845 boarding at The Old Manse while Nathaniel Hawthorne and Sophia Peabody lived there, and remained friends with the Hawthornes. This friendship later became strained when the Hawthornes rented the little red house on the Sturgis‚Äô property in the Berkshires.Stebbins, Richard P. (1999). ‚ÄúBerkshire Quartet: Hawthornes and Tappans at Tanglewood, 1850-1851.‚Äù Nathaniel Hawthorne Review, Vol. 25, No. 1 (Spring 1999), p. 1-20. She had purchased this former farm with her husband in 1849, eventually building a stick-style cottage on the land in 1865.Jackson, Jr., Richard S. and Cornelia Brooke Gilder (2006). The Houses of the Berkshires, 1870-1930. New York: Acanthus Press, p. 28-30. Sturgis named this estate ‚ÄúTanglewood,‚Äù the name that Hawthorne eventually used for his short story collection Tanglewood Tales (1853), written while in residence in the little red house. In 1847, Sturgis married William Aspinwall Tappan, son of abolitionist Lewis Tappan and Susanna Aspinwall, and they had two daughters, Ellen Sturgis Tappan Dixey (b. 1849) and Mary Aspinwall Tappan (1851-1941). Mary, with her niece Rosamund Dixey Brooks Hepburn (1887-1948), later donated the family summer home, Tanglewood, in the Berkshires to the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

In 1809 it was the first of 152 forts, redoubts and other defences to be developed as part of three defensive lines between the Atlantic Ocean and the River Tagus that were designed by the Duke of Wellington to protect the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, from possible invasion by French troops during the Peninsular War. These came to be known as the Lines of Torres Vedras. Together with the Fort of Alqueid√£o, it is considered the most important fortress of those constructed for the Lines. History Following the Treaty of Fontainebleau signed between France and Spain in October 1807, which provided for the invasion and subsequent division of Portuguese territory into three kingdoms, French troops under the command of General Junot entered Portugal, which requested support from the British. Thus, in July 1808 troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, at the time known as Arthur Wellesley, landed in Portugal and defeated French troops at the Battles of Roli√ßa and Vimeiro. This forced Junot to negotiate the Convention of Cintra, which led to the evacuation of the French army from Portugal. In March 1809, Marshal Soult led a new French expedition that advanced south to the city of Porto before being repulsed by Portuguese-British troops and forced to withdraw. The Chapel of S√£o Vicente, now housing a Lines of Torres Vedras Interpretation Centre However, the threat of further invasions by the French led Wellington, on October 20, 1809, to order the construction of defensive lines in order to protect Lisbon from Napol√©on Bonaparte's troops. Work on the Fort of S√£o Vicente as part of the first line of defence began on November 8, 1809, at more or less the same time as improvements to the Fort of S√£o Juli√£o da Barra, close to Lisbon, and construction of the new Fort of Alqueid√£o to the southeast of Torres Vedras near Sobral de Monte Agra√ßo, under the overall supervision of Colonel Richard Fletcher who was commander of the Royal Engineers. A total of 152 forts, redoubts and other defences forming three lines of defence were eventually constructed over 80 kilometres, reinforcing the natural obstacles that the land offered and making maximum use of the existing topography. In addition to protecting Lisbon, the defensive lines were also designed to cover Wellington‚Äôs own retreat and possible evacuation from a beach close to the Fort of S√£o Juli√£o da Barra, if his troops were overwhelmed by French forces. A model of Wellington's system for communicating between forts, in the fort's Interpretation Centre The third French invasion was headed by Marechal Mass√©na. He was defeated in September 1810 by the Anglo-Portuguese army commanded by Wellington at the Battle of Bu√ßaco. Despite this he forced the allies to retreat to the Lines of Torres Vedras, where a stalemate ensued for several months. He eventually had to retreat due to lack of food and supplies, withdrawing to the Spanish border. Thus the Fort of S√£o Vicente did not see action during the Peninsular War. It finally saw action in 1846 when, during the so-called Little Civil War, it was the scene of a battle between the attacking troops of the Duke of Saldanha and the besieged forces of the Count of Bonfim. This was the only time a force has directly attacked one of the fortifications of the Lines. After the Convention of Gramido in 1847 brought peace to Portugal, most of the forts ceased to have any military function and were allowed to gradually fall into ruin. Features The Fort of S√£o Vicente was one of the most fortified of the forts of the first line. Built on top of a hill with a Y-shaped design, it consisted of a set of three strongholds, originally separated by three removable bridges, and surrounded by a perimeter wall about 1,500 metres in length. All of the defensive installations of the Lines of Torres Vedras were given numbers and these three strongholds were Nos. 20-22. The fort had 39 cannon and was garrisoned by 2,200 men, being able to hold up to 4,000 if necessary. It also housed a signals post. The existing Castle of Torres Vedras, a short distance away, was incorporated into the same defensive line, having eleven cannon. Together they defended the main road between Lisbon and Coimbra, which went through a narrow valley between the two hills. The fort was built on the site of a small chapel, dedicated to St. Vincent and dating back to the 12th century. This was incorporated into the design. Tourism The Fort of S√£o Vicente has not undergone major alterations since construction, and restoration work has been faithful to the original design. A Lines of Torres Vedras Interpretation Centre, which is sited in the chapel at the fort, was opened in July 2017. It includes a model of the means by which signals were exchanged between the forts of the lines and also presents a short video describing the history of the Lines. See also * Lines of Wellington.

He is the current director of the sports communication program. His research primarily focuses on the study of Sport Communication. Billings received his PhD in Communication & Culture from Indiana University in 1999. He was the founding chair of both the Communication and Sport Division of the National Communication Association and the Sport Communication Interest Group of the International Communication Association. He has also chaired the Research Symposium for Broadcast Education Association and the Visiting Chair of Olympism at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. His research often focuses on the intersection of sport, mass media, and how people interpret identity issues within sport when consuming sport content. He also focuses on elements surrounding spots contents, such as fantasy sport. Billings has won over 60 awards for his scholarship, including national and international awards from the National Communication Association, International Communication Association, Broadcast Education Association, and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication, and many book awards, which provides academic perspective to journalists on matters related to sport communication.  Research Interests  Much of Billings' research focuses on various aspects of how American sports media covers and affects issues of gender, race, and identity. Two of his books, Olympic Media: Inside the Biggest Show on Television and Olympic Television: Broadcasting the biggest show on Earth analyze the production, content, and the effects of NBC's broadcast of the Olympics Games. In particular, he focuses on the topics of ethnicity, gender, and nationality, and how that is communicated to the public via the telecast. In 2009, Billings co-authored with Heather L. Hundley Examining Identity in Sports Media, focusing on how identity issues are communicated and shaped by sports media. More recent books have focused on a wider range of identity issues including Native American representations in sports (in his 2018 book with Jason Edward Black, Mascot Nation ) and the role of media in gay athlete coming out stories (in his 2018 book with Leigh Moscowitz, Media and the Coming Out of Gay Male Athletes in American Team Sports). His most recent book with William Benoit, The Rise and Fall of Mass Communication, tackles sports along with all other forms of news and entertainment to advance axioms of media balkanization theory.

Background Ancient Polynesians and others who inhabited the tropical Pacific before the Europeans arrived, knew of and feared the hurricanes of the South Pacific. They were keen and accurate observers of nature and developed various myths and legends, which reflected their knowledge of these systems. For example, the people of Mangaia in the Cook Islands had over 30 different names for the wind direction including Maoaketa, which indicated that a cyclonic storm existed to the west of the island. During the 1700s, Captain James Cook conducted three voyages within the Pacific Ocean and it is thought that he didn't collect any information about or experience any tropical cyclones. Europeans that followed Cook soon realised that the South Pacific was not free of hurricanes and were the first to publish accounts about the systems. During 1853, Thomas Dobson became the first person to collate information about these systems, in order to attempt to understand and explain the characteristics of 24 tropical cyclones. However, these descriptions were considered to be vague and of little value, because he only had a small amount of data and no synoptic weather charts. Over the next 40 years various reports, journals and log books on the storms were published before E Knipping consolidated these reports and extended Dobson's list out to 120 tropical cyclones during 1893. During the 1920s Stephen Sargent Visher did some research into tropical cyclones in the Pacific and visited several island nations; including Fiji, Japan and the Philippines to obtain information on potential systems. He also consulted various journals and reports as well as Dobson's and Knipping's work, before he authored a number of papers on tropical cyclones in the Pacific. These papers contained information about 259 tropical storms in the South Pacific between 160¬∞E and 140¬∞W, two of which occurred during 1789 and 1819, while the rest occurred between 1830 and 1923. Visher also tried to estimate how many systems were occurring on an annual basis in each area, but overcompensated for his incomplete records and came up with a figure of 12 severe tropical cyclones per year. During Visher's time and until the start of World War II, there was insufficient information available to allow for an accurate deception of tropical cyclone tracks.

In particular, the New Zealand's Meteorological Service also took control of the Apia Observatory and created a facility at Lacuala Bay in Suva, Fiji during 1940. Meteorological operations were also started at the Nadi Airport by the United States Army Air Forces Meteorological Unit during 1942. During 1946, the Nadi military establishment was converted to a civilian unit, before the forecasting unit at Lacuala Bay was merged with the Nadi weather office during the following year. At this time, the Nadi Weather Office (NWO) primarily provided meteorological services for aviation as a branch of the NZMS. However, over the next few years, the NWO gradually expanded its services to the non-aviation sector, providing daily weather forecasts and tropical cyclone warnings for most Pacific island countries and some territories, and international marine services for a large part of the tropical South Pacific Ocean. During the decade, tropical cyclones would have been impacted by the El Nino events of 1940-41, 1941-42 and 1946-47 as well as the La Nina events of 1942-43 and 1949-51. Systems 1940 *February 4 ‚Äì 18, 1940 ‚Äì A tropical cyclone developed to the west of Tuvalu and moved south-westwards through central Vanuatu during February 8.

Inclusive Theology is rooted in a larger growing movement called Interfaith which aims to create unity among various religions. One should keep in mind that the inclusive interpretation is a minority view, and is considered by many clergy not to be in line with the official doctrine of Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, as well as many of the largest Protestant denominations.

Biography  √âliane Brault was born in the 9th arrondissement of Paris to a rich family. Her father, √âlie-Simon Alexandre Brault (1868‚Äì1898), was a lawyer at the Court of Appeal of Paris and also a doctor at H√¥pital Saint-Louis.√âric Nadaud, \\"√âliane Brault, un parcours au f√©minin, radical, antifasciste, progressiste, ma√ßonnique et f√©ministe (1895‚Äì1982 )\\", Histoire@Politique.

He'd just completed his month as an aide-major in the south when he caught typhoid fever by treating soldiers from the 22nd Chasseurs Alpins Battalion; he died a month later, a victime du devoir professionnel (victim of professional duty), at the age of thirty-one. Her mother, Isabelle Moses (1867‚Äì1942), was born in Lima to a Jewish Peruvian middle-class family that had converted to Catholicism.\\"Une victime du devoir\\", L'Intransigeant, 14 November 1898, p. 3 read online (in French). During World War I, she married her childhood friend, Jean Sabourdin (1890‚Äì1918), who died in the front. It was in 1917, with Sabourdin, that she gave birth to her first son, Roger Sabourdin. She remarried in 1923; this time, she married a lawyer, Louis Galli√© (1883‚Äì1974), with whom she had her second son, Alexandre Brault Galli√© (1925‚Äì1971). In 1933, √âliane Brault and Louis Galli√© divorced. On top of her political and Masonic commitments, √âliane Brault showed an interest in the cause of childhood and adolescence throughout her life; she was Deputy Director of the School of Rehabilitation in Clermont, Oise, in 1936, inspector of a number of institutions in 1937, Secretary General of the Higher Council for Children and, a member of the Higher Council of Assistance publique (public assistance). In 1938, she published her recommendations in the Revue d'hygi√®ne et de m√©decine sociale (the Journal of Hygiene and Social Medicine).Nicole Foussat and CNHRM 2015, p. 99‚Äì100.  Radical Party  Her second husband, Louis Galli√©, and √âmile Borel, a pacifist, introduced her to the Radical Party, which she went on to join in 1925. She was committed to her work with the party, which she did largely with Marcelle Kraemer-Bach, a lawyer and member of the French Union for Women's Suffrage. She worked as a speaker and journalist for the papers Le Radical, La France radical, Le R√©publicain jacobin and L‚Äô√àre nouvelle. She was a member of the journalists' union and, through her articles and speeches, expressed her expectation of a society where the principles of freedom as well as equality of rights and labour are applied indistinctly. She had recognised expertise and she was one of the five women members of the party's bureau before 1940. She was elected in 1933‚Äîan election which was considered a feminist success against her opponents within the party. She worked towards a policy of social works and solidarity.Nicole Foussat and CNHRM 2015, p. 98. In 1934, amidst political crisis and the rise of the extreme right, √âliane Brault started l'Action d√©mocratique des femmes (the Democratic Action of Women) and regularly marched in demonstrations in support of the Republic. In 1935, she founded la F√©d√©ration des femmes radicale (the Federation of Radical Women), of which she became president. After a trip to the Soviet Union, she became interested in the Soviet regime's position on women and children. It was because of this interest that she became closer to the Communist Party. The 1936 elections were a success for her and left-wing politics in France as many radical and socialist members of the Popular Front won their elections. She was part of the fight against fascism, and openly supported the Spanish Republicans as well as the victims of fascism throughout Europe. With the fall of L√©on Blum's government in April 1938, she joined the left-wing of the Radical Party.Nicole Foussat and CNHRM 2015, p. 99. In 1939, she used her influence to open the borders and welcome children who had to flee from, or were orphaned by, Franco's regime.  Free France  After France's defeat in 1940 and the establishment of the Vichy regime, which excluded Jews and Freemasons from public office, √âliane Brault was the subject of denunciation in the extreme right-wing newspaper, Je suis partout. Being an anti-fascist, Freemason and of Jewish descent, she was relieved of her duties 1 October 1940. Due to having already made contact with the Resistance, she was arrested January 1941, and imprisoned in Marseille in February of the same year. She managed to escape and fled to Algeria and, afterwards, Casablanca where the British would allow her to go to London. Upon arrival in London, she joined the Free French forces. She began organising a body of french doctors and nurses, taking command as a captain. With part of her group, she joined the 1st Free French Division in Beirut, where she remained at the disposal of command. She helped fighting the Nazi invasion of Russia and found the pilots of the Normandie-Niemen. In April 1944, she returned to AlgiersGaujac 2000, p. 117. and followed the French corps in the Italian Campaign where, from General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, she received authorisation to create a unit of \\"liaison-relief\\" intended to give first aid and bring essential aid to liberated populations and combat zones.Nicole Foussat and CNHRM 2015, p. 101.Gaujac 2000, p. 119. After taking part in the Provence landings and the Battle of Alsace with her unit, she was summoned to assist in the perilous evacuation of Thann. She crossed the Rhine and stayed in the Black Forest until November 1945.Nicole Foussat and CNHRM 2015, p. 102.  Postwar  At the end of the war, she resumed her duties at the Ministry of Public Health and Population. She received a certificate of higher administrative studies at √âcole nationale d'administration, allowing her to work under the direction of the ministry until her retirement. She left the Radical Party and joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), where she committed herself to social work. She continued her political commitment to the Unified Socialist Party and worked with various left-wing movements, such as the MRAP, Association France-URSS (France-USSR Association) and, the International Women's Democratic Federation. In the forefront of the socialist movement, she gradually moved away from the party; as she approached her retirement, she put an end to her political activities. However, she did continue her republican commitments, joining le Soci√©t√© des amis de l'√©cole la√Øque (the Society of Friends of the Secular School), and she devoted time to Association France- Isra√´l. As soon as she retired, she invested herself mostly in Freemasonry.Nicole Foussat and CNHRM 2015, p. 104.  Freemasonry  √âliane Brault began her long Masonic career in the Masonry of Adoption at the Grande Loge de France. She was initiated 28 June 1927‚Äîthirty-two years old‚Äîat the adoption lounge, Union et Bienfaisance, then quickly became secretary. She also took part in the creation of Le G√©n√©ral Peign√© in 1930. She was made a Worshipful Master from 1934 until the start of the Second world war. Furthermore, she attended the lodges La Nouvelle J√©rusalem (the New Jerusalem) and Minerve (Minerva). In 1945, she rejoined La Nouvelle J√©rusalem within the Women's Grand Lodge of France. Later, she joined the Marie Bonnevial lodge at Le Droit Humain (DH). As the DH does not recognise the Rite of Adoption, she agreed to be initiated with the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. She was successive secretary-general and vice president of the national council and the grand inspector of the order until 1969.\\"Les franc-ma√ßonnes c√©l√®bres\\", on glff.org, Grande Log√© f√©minine de France (in French). Feeling her role in DH was too heavily constraining and looking for a less symbolist approach which, according to her, tends to move away from societal reflection, she founded the Universal Mixed Grand Lodge (GLMU) in 1973, of which she became the first president, splitting from the other Freemasons. The GLMU worked with values close to those of the Grand Orient de France while being mixed. In 1980, she founded the Supreme Conseil Mixte de France (the Supreme Mixed Council of France) which gradually accepted the Scottish Rite. During this period, she wrote several books on Freemasonry and participated in radio programs.Nicole Foussat and CNHRM 2015, p. 105.  End of life  √âliane Brault died 25 August 1982, in Paris at the age of 86. She was cremated, in accordance with her will, and her ashes were deposited in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.  Awards  For her actions in World War II, she won the Escapees' Medal and the Croix de Guerre 1939‚Äì1945. In 1936, she was made Knight of the Legion of Honour and, in 1947, she was promoted to the rank of Officer within the Legion.Nicole Foussat and CNHRM 2015, p. 103.  Family  Her son, Roger Sabourdin, married Gratienne Nada, daughter of Ren√© Nada (Path√© Studios director), in 1938 at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.

Overview Espada wrote the poem in 1980 in Madison, Wisconsin. It is free verse in form and utilizes imagery and metaphor as the main literary elements in the poem. In a talk he gave at the University of Arizona in 1992, Espada stated that in his \\"wanderings\\" between New York and Puerto Rico, he traveled to Wisconsin to go to school. He came upon hard times, and ultimately found himself \\"officially destitute,\\" which is when he visited the Saint Vincent de Paul Food Pantry. It was at the food pantry that he had the experience which inspired this poem. Analysis Through the entirety of the poem, Espada creates vivid imagery for the reader, especially through his use of metaphor and simile. Due to the fact that he is a largely political writer, it is likely that Espada meant this poem to be a protest against the way people treat the poor. This is evidenced by the phrase \\"Christian suspicion\\" in the second line of the poem. In the end, he uses the phrase \\"a maraca shaker in the salsa band of the unemployed.\\" This is a reference to his Latino heritage. References External links * .

Jacques had been convicted of a 1996 attempted murder and served 15 years in prison, was released from the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for deportation, but was never deported because the government of his nation of birth and citizenship, Haiti, refused to accept him. The case \\"received widespread attention\\" and \\"sparked outrage\\" because Jacques was not deported and committed a second murder after his release from federal custody. Crime Jacques stabbed Chadwick to death in her apartment on Spaulding Street in Norwich, Connecticut following what is thought to have been an argument about drugs that belonged to Chadwick‚Äôs boyfriend, a drug dealer. Victim As a result of her daughter's death, Chadwick's mother, Wendy Hartling, became active in the Remembrance Project and an active supporter of President Trump. Perpetrator Jacques is an illegal immigrant. Jacques, a Haitian citizen, arrived in the United States in 1992 after being intercepted in a boat off the Florida coast. Previous crime and failed deportation In 1996, Jacques was involved in a shooting on Laurel Hill Avenue in Norwich in which Jacques' former girlfriend suffered a serious head injury and her new boyfriend was killed. Jacques was convicted on weapons charges and attempted murder. He served 15 years in prison and was released in January 2012 into custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He was held by ICE for 205 days, while arrangements were made to deport him to Haiti. At the last minute, the government of Haiti refused to take him, citing his lack of identity documents. He was released by ICE on Nov. 9, 2012. Jacques could not be deported because the Hatian government refused to accept him, saying that he could not prove that he was a citizen.. Federal agencies failed to deport Jacques on three separate occasions between 2002 and the murder of Chadwick. Senator Richard Blumenthal and Representative Joe Courtney jointly introduced \\"Casey's Law,\\" a bill intended to expedite deportation of illegal immigrants who pose a threat to public safety or who have committed a violent crime, and to \\"crack down\\" on countries that delay or refuse official U.S. attempts to deport dangerous criminals to their home country. Federal investigation In January 2016, the Department of Homeland Security opened an investigation into the handling of the Jacques deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The report found that while ICE had failed to pursue all possible avenues to establish Jacques‚Äô Haitian citizenship, it was unlikely to been able to satisfy the government of Haiti even if it had pursued all possible ways to establish his birth and citizenship. Legal proceedings Jacques was convicted of murdering Chadwick and was sentenced to 60 years in prison, the maximum sentence for murder in Connecticut. Jacques' attorneys filed an appeal of the conviction on procedural grounds and the appellate case has been accepted by the State Supreme Court. The appeal is based on the question of whether Norwich police needed a warrant to search Jacques' home on July 15, 2015; his lease on the apartment had expired at the time the search was conducted. Public and political attention In a 2016 campaign speech, Donald Trump criticized \\"a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities... the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick‚Äôs tragic death in Connecticut just last year.\\" During another campaign speech he blamed his opponent Hillary Clinton, for her \\"refusal,\\" during her term as Secretary of State to force foreign governments to take \\"killers\\" back, asserting that, \\"One foreign national and convicted killer who should have been sent back to his home country in 2012 was instead set free by Clinton's watch. Six months after his release, he killed again, murdering a 25-year old beautiful Casey Chadwick. State Representative Joe Courtney complained of \\"a breakdown in the system that allowed a convicted felon with a deportation order to return to the Norwich community.\\" Senator Richard Blumenthal, Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Joe Courtney stated that, \\"It is unacceptable that ICE failed to remove a convicted attempted murderer subject to a final deportation order ‚Äî a measure that would have saved the life of Casey Chadwick.\\" Representative John Culberson of Texas stated that when Haiti refused to take Jacques back the country should have been treated as Guyana was treated by the United States in 2001 when it refused to accept deportees; all visa approvals from Guyana to the United States were suspended until Guyana complied.

The biblical bases for a cosmic Christology is often found in Colossians, Ephesians, and the prologue to the gospel of John.  Early church  Irenaeus (c. 130 ‚Äì c. 202 AD) offered one of the earliest articulations of a cosmic Christology in his Against Heresies. In his theory of atonement, Irenaeus speaks about how all of humanity was created good but tainted by sin, but that all of creation was \\"recapitulated\\" and restored under the new headship of Christ. This \\"cosmic\\" Christology would be a dominant view throughout much of the patristic period, as well as within Eastern Christianity, while alternative positions began to arise during the medieval period.  Modern ecotheology  In the modern period, a renewed interest in the cosmic Christ would arise among a number of Western scholars interested in developing an ecotheology. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was among the first to speak again of a cosmic Christ in the 1920s and 1930s. He understood the Incarnation as bringing the historical Christ into the material world and, through evolution, leading all of creation towards perfection in the Omega Point. Later scholars, such as Joseph Sittler, Matthew Fox, and J√ºrgen Moltmann, would likewise speak about the need to reclaim a cosmic Christology to speak about Christ's concern for creation.  Asian contexts  The cosmic Christ has also been of particular interest amongst Asian Christians. This was particularly poignant through debates that arose from the World Council of Churches meeting in New Delhi in 1961, when the Indian Paul D. Devanandan argued from that a cosmic Christ united all things to himself; this, he claimed, included non-Christian religions. This would continue to be asserted by South Asian Christians such as M. M. Thomas from India and D. T. Niles of Ceylon as a rationale to dialogue with and work together with other religions. In China, it has been suggested that a cosmic Christology has been present in the early 20th century, among figures such as T. C. Chao and Y. T. Wu. The cosmic Christ has also been important for later Chinese Christians affiliated with the Three-Self Patriotic Movement in the 1980s and 1990s. For instance, K. H. Ting used the cosmic Christ as a basis for Christians to work with communists, and Wang Weifan offers an evangelical version of the cosmic Christ to work with non-Christians.

Workflow  BLESS workflow. 1) Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) are labeled in situ with proximal DNA hairpin linkers containing a biotin marker. 2) Cells are fixed, lysed and treated with proteinases for extraction and subsequent shearing of genomic DNA (gDNA). 3) Labeled and unlabeled gDNA fragments are passed through streptavidin-derived beads, which capture the labeled fragments with high specificity due to the strong affinity of biotin markers to streptavidin. 4) After passage through streptavidin beads, unlabeled gDNA fragments are removed, leaving the enriched biotin- labeled gDNA fragments. 5) Distal linker is ligated to labeled gDNA fragments at the free end. 6) I-SceI endonuclease cuts linkers at the restriction site to release gDNA fragments from biotin. 7) Barcode-specific primers are used for amplification of enriched fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). 8) Next-Generation Sequencing of PCR products is then used for single nucleotide- resolution analysis of DSBs in the genome.  Biotinylated linker design  The biotinylated linker is designed to form a hairpin structure that specifically labels DSBs and not single-strand DNA breaks. The linker has a blunt, ligatable end with a known barcode sequence that labels the site of ligation as well as an XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site adjacent to the barcode. The hairpin loop of the linker is covalently bound to a biotin molecule, allowing for subsequent enrichment of labeled DNA with streptavidin beads. Use of biotin labels allows for specific binding without disruption of DNA due to the small size of the marker. Because biotin also has high affinity to streptavidin, further highly specific purification can be performed on streptavidin beads.  Nuclei purification and in situ labeling  Following the induction of DSBs, cells are fixed with formaldehyde, lysed, and treated with proteinases to purify intact nuclei. The initial fixation step stabilizes chromatin and prevents the formation of additional DSBs during sample preparation. DSBs are then blunted and incubated with biotinylated linkers in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. T4 ligase does not recognize single-stranded breaks, and as such directly labels the DSB sites through covalent attachment of the biotinylated linker.  DNA extraction, fragmentation, and purification  Labeled genomic DNA is extracted from nuclei and fragmented by HaeIII restriction enzyme digestion and sonication. Labeled DNA fragments are then purified using beads derived from streptavidin, a biotin-binding protein found in the bacterium Streptomyces avidinii. Because the interaction of streptavidin and biotin is strong and highly specific, purification of sample on streptavidin-coated beads allows for robust enrichment of labeled DNA fragments.  Distal linker DNA labeling and digestion  A second labeling step occurs after fragmentation and biotin-streptavidin affinity purification to attach primer binding sites to the free end of the captured DNA. Similar to the first labeling step, T4 DNA ligase is used to attach a distal linker to the unlabeled end of the DNA. The distal linker also has an XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site but is not covalently bound to a biotin molecule. Once the distal linker is attached, the captured DNA fragments are digested using I-SceI endonucleases that cut both the biotinylated linkers and the distal linkers to release the DNA fragments.  PCR amplification and sequencing  The digested DNA strands are amplified using PCR with primers complementary to barcode sequences in the biotinylated linker and the distal linker. The amplified DNA is further processed by digesting with XhoI restriction enzymes to remove the I-SceI ends and purified prior to sequencing. Although use of next-generation sequencing methods is recommended for BLESS analysis, Sanger sequencing has also been shown to generate successful, albeit less robust results.  Computational analysis  The BLESS sequencing reads can be analyzed using the Instant Sequencing (iSeq) software suite. To detect sites of DSBs, reads are aligned to a reference genome using bowtie to determine the chromosome positions. The genome is divided into intervals and hypergeometric tests are used to identify intervals enriched with mapped reads. DSBs are identified by comparing enrichment in treated samples versus a control. A statistically significant increase in a DNA damage-induced sample suggests that the DNA at this interval is fragile and enriched in DSBs.  Advantages  # Use of biotinylated DNA linkers designed to specifically recognize double-stranded DNA breaks allows for a less biased, more direct survey of the breakome without the need to rely on native and/or DSB-proxy proteins, such as the phosphorylated histone variant H2A.X (Œ≥H2A.X), in the cell. Because of this, BLESS can be utilized in a variety of cells from different organisms. # For the same reason, BLESS is also sensitive to multiple sources of double-stranded breaks, such as chemical and physical DNA disruption, replication fork stalling, as well as presence of telomere ends. This makes BLESS suitable for analysis of cells at various conditions. # Labeling of DSBs occurs in situ, reducing the risk of false positives form detection of DNA breaks due to mechanical shearing and chemical sample treatment. # #  Limitations  # Due to specificity of the linker design, biotinylated markers can only label double-stranded DNA breaks at blunt, not cohesive ends, leading to less efficient ligation. # Compared to newer breakome survey methods, such as BLISS, BLESS requires large amounts of cellular starting material for successful analysis, resulting in tedious and time-consuming sample preparation and processing. To process 24 samples, the BLESS protocol requires 60 work-hours over the course of 15 days whereas BLISS requires 12 work-hours over 5 days. # Because cells require chemical fixation prior to DNA extraction, BLESS is prone to high background noise from fixation artifacts. However, stringent custom optimization has been shown to reduce this issue. # Due to the lack of PCR controls, BLESS is not a fully quantitative method and is prone to amplification bias, resulting in poor scalability. # BLESS is only suitable for detecting double-stranded breaks at one specific time in the genome, as compared to continuous analysis.  Alternative methods  ;Breaks labeling in situ and sequencing (BLISS):In BLISS, cells or tissue sections are attached to a cover glass first before DSB labeling. This allows some centrifugation steps to be omitted, thus decreasing the number of artificial DSBs introduced from sample preparation, and reducing sample loss. Importantly, it allows a much smaller amount of starting material to be used compared to BLESS. Another improvement is the use of in vitro transcription to generate and amplify RNA sequences for library preparation. BLISS uses T7 bacteriophage-mediated transcription rather than PCR, reducing errors caused by PCR amplification bias that occur with BLESS. ; Immobilized- BLESS (i-BLESS): A limitation of the original BLESS method is that it is problematic in application to smaller cells such as yeast cells. While low centrifugation speeds employed during nuclei isolation are not efficient enough for small cells, increasing centrifugation speeds can shear the genomic DNA. However, in i-BLESS, cells are immobilized in agarose beads prior to DSB labeling. This allows the use of higher centrifugation speeds without artificial DNA shearing. The remainder of the DSB labeling procedure follows that of the BLESS method, and labeled DNA fragments are recovered from the agarose beads prior to the streptavidin capture step. The i-BLESS method is not limited to yeast and can theoretically be applied to all cells. ; DSBCapture: Similar to BLESS, DSBCapture uses biotinylated adapters to label DSBs in situ and streptavidin beads to isolate labeled DNA fragments for amplification and sequencing. While labeling in BLESS relies on blunt-end ligation, DSBCapture uses more efficient cohesive-end ligation to attach biotinylated modified Illumina adapters. In addition, DSBCapture relies on fewer PCR steps compared to BLESS, reducing amplification bias. This method also generates libraries with higher sequence diversity than BLESS, eliminating the need to spike in other libraries to improve diversity prior to sequencing. Furthermore, DSBCapture uses single-end sequencing in contrast to BLESS where sequencing can begin from both ends. Single-end sequencing results reflect only the sequences of DSB sites, improving data yield. ; GUIDE-Seq: Also known as Genome-Wide Unbiased Identification of DSBs Enabled by Sequencing, GUIDE-Seq uses the incorporation of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (dsODN) sequences to label sites of DSBs in living cells. It allows DSBs to be labeled over an extended time period, and the sites of DNA damage identified through GUIDE-Seq reflect accumulated DSBs. In contrast, BLESS only labels and detects transient DSBs that exist when the cells were fixed.  Applications  While double-stranded breaks in the DNA can be caused by various sources of disruption, they are often observed at high frequency during apoptosis and can contribute to genome instability, resulting in oncogenic mutations. For this reason, high-resolution, specific DSB-mapping methods like BLESS are useful for breakome surveys. DSBs can be artificially induced using genome editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 or TALEN. These technologies may lead to unintentional modifications of DNA at off-target locations on the genome. Since BLESS can identify the nucleotide position of DSBs, it can be used to determine if off-target genome editing has occurred and the location of DSBs unintentionally introduced by these nuclease systems.

Biography Myrtil Maas was born in 1792 to a Jewish family in Tomblaine, Meurthe. A student at the Lyc√©e Charlemagne, he was admitted in 1813 to both the √âcole polytechnique and the √âcole normale in Paris, choosing the latter. He studied at the √âcole normale until the political upheaval of 1815 caused the suspension of the school. In that year, when walking with some of his schoolfellows in the Champ de Mars, where the troops were drilling, he was accidentally shot in the leg, and the wound never perfectly healed. Being a Jew, he was unable to obtain a chair in mathematics; but he found employment first in a porcelain factory and then as a private tutor. In 1818 he was employed as actuary by the newly-formed Compagnie g√©n√©rale des assurances sur la vie et contre l'incendie, a Paris insurance company. He joined Olinde Rodrigues to form an committee to watch over and control the operations of the company, and the principles they established for insurance tariffs were soon adopted by all the leading French life insurance companies. Together, they produced the actuarial tables that would be used by all French insurance companies throughout the century, which were eventually published in 1860 and had seven editions until 1933. Maas laboured actively in the interests of the Jews, and played a leading role in the Consistoire central isra√©lite in the 1830s and 1840s, serving as its vice-president from 1843. He died on 27 February 1865 from a malady that developed from his wound.

In 1692, he was granted H√∏rbygaard at Holb√¶k and raised to the peerage by Christian V of Denmark. Early life Span was born in Oldendorf in the County of Schaumburg, the son of consul Bernhard Span and Elisabeth Beichmann. He joined the merchant navy at an early age, and was for a short while a prisoner of the French.  Naval career  Span enrolled in the Royal Dutch Navy where in 1652‚Äì54 he served in the war with England. In 1654‚Äì58, he served in the Venetian navy in the war against the Ottoman Empire. In 1658, he returned to the Royal Dutch Navy. He served under Michael de Ruyter when an expeditionary fleet was sent to Denmark where it managed to liberate Nyborg in November 1659. He then returned to the Netherlands where he began to sail for Dutch India, first as a navigator and from 1664 as a master. He was in East Asia in 1665‚Äì71 but then returned to the Netherlands.

It was founded by Mark Weinstein in 2012. The service touts its commitment to user privacy and control as its outstanding feature. History In 1998, Mark Weinstein, author and Internet corporate executive, established SuperGroups.com, a social media Web site. The site was closed by its largest investor in 2001. Gathering largely the same leadership team, Weinstein incorporated Sgrouples Inc. in 2011. The new firm was based in Mountain View, California. Initially, Sgrouples focused on building an online storage site named MyCloud, where users were given 4 GB of storage for free. Users were given the option to see only the advertising they chose (if any), while users requesting more than 4 GB of storage space were charged a fee. MyCloud's proprietary application programming interface was not released to developers; instead, in a model similar to that used by Apple Inc., Sgrouples allowed third parties to license their code. Weinstein decided to create a social media site with strong privacy controls after hearing Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive officer of Facebook say that \\"privacy is a social norm of the past.\\" MeWe was incorporated as a subsidiary of Sgrouples, and based in Culver City, California. In 2012, Sgrouples assembled a team of 30 software developers to begin work on MeWe. Weinstein's goal was to give users of the site the maximum amount of privacy possible. Over the next six years, Sgrouples raised about $4.8 million from wealthy individuals such as Lynda Weinman, founder of lynda.com; fashion designer Rachel Roy; and authors Jack Canfield and Marci Shimoff. By 2015, as MeWe neared the end of its beta testing cycle, the press called MeWe's software \\"not dissimilar to Facebook\\". Because of Weinstein's mandated privacy requirements, users retained control over what posts their contacts could see. The site retained a \\"like\\" feature similar to other social media sites, but a user's contacts were not notified when a user \\"liked\\" a post or image. Users were not at that time able to make posts public for any visitor to see, and images could not be tagged. As with MyCloud, users retained the right to see any, all, or no advertising. Add-on features included online storage (for a fee), a \\"Pro\\" version (available for a fee), the ability to create fan pages, and a photo printing service (available for a fee). In 2016, MeWe was named a finalist for \\"Start-Up of the Year\\" in the Innovative World Technology category at SXSW, and made Entrepreneur magazine's list of the top 360 entrepreneurial companies of the year. MeWe finished its initial financing round in July 2018 by raising $5.2 million in new funds. The company began work on upgrading MeWe and initiating work on an enterprise version called MeWePRO. Corporate governance Mark Weinstein is the founder and chief executive officer of MeWe. Advisors to MeWe include father of the World Wide Web Sir Tim Berners-Lee and filmmaker Cullen Hoback. Website Features The MeWe site and application has features common to most social media and social networking sites: Users can post text and images to what the site calls their \\"Home Feed\\", users can \\"like\\" others' posts using emojis, there is a standard set of animated GIFs, users can create specialized groups, and there is online chat. Users have control over how posts appear in their Home Feed (such as chronological, most recently commented upon, and more). Posts set to \\"private\\" can be seen only by other users who are in a person's contact list; while posts set to \\"public\\" appear to everybody. The latter feature was added after October 2018, when a wave of Google+ users \\"migrated\\" to MeWe. Users may also choose to allow only subsets of contacts see one's Home Feed posts. Unlike most social media sites, MeWe does not notify users when their contacts make posts. The \\"disappearing content\\" feature of MeWePRO allows user content or posts to appear for a period of time (chosen by the user) and then be wiped from the site. Users may create groups as well as post. Groups may be Private (the group is seen only by its members, and the only way to join is to have an existing member issue an invitation), Selective (user may see and attempt to join the group, but approval by the group's owner or administrators is required), and Open (any user can see and join the group). Group owners and administrators have the choice of listing the group in MeWe's \\"group directory\\". MeWe reported in June 2018 that the site already had 90,000 active groups, 60,000 of which were \\"public\\" and open to all users. Online chat may occur between two or more people or among members of a group. Person-to-person online chat is similar to that in most other social media and social networking sites, and supports text, video calling, and voice calling. \\"Secret Chat\\" is a special feature of MeWePRO which uses double ratchet encryption to ensure that chats are private (even from MeWe itself). Secret Chat is free for the first 30 days; longer access requires a subscription fee. Each group also supports a chat feature. \\"Privacy Mail\\" is another feature of MeWe. It is similar to the standalone Facebook Messenger app for Android and iOS. MeWe provides each user with 8 GB of free online storage for images, video, and similar items. Up to 500 GB of storage is available for a fee. The mobile app version of MeWe also contains a \\"custom camera\\", which utilizes the user's mobile phone camera to take images and video and import them into MeWe. As of December 2018, MeWe was available in Macintosh and Windows desktop version as well as a mobile app for devices running Android or iOS. It was also available in English and nine other languages. Terms of service MeWe's terms of service agreement contains a \\"Privacy Bill of Rights\\" in which the company pledges never to engage in data mining of user information or content, or to filter the Home Feed in any way except that chosen by the user. The MeWe pledges in its user agreement to never use cookies or spyware to generate content about users, and that it will not track user activity in any way or sell user data to a third party. Users have the right to completely download and delete all their data when closing their account. Business model MeWe calls itself the \\"alternative to Facebook\\", and emphasizes its commitment to privacy over generating revenue. MeWe pledges in its terms of service agreement to remain a free service. The MeWe business model does not rely on data mining or advertising revenue. MeWe generates revenue from Secret Chat and extra storage fees, and by selling custom emojis. In June 2018, MeWe said it was already generating revenue from the MeWePRO enterprise service would generate revenue in the future from \\"MeWe Pages\\", a paid add-on to the service. MeWe passed the four million member mark in the middle of March 2019.; On July 17 2019, Steven Loeb reported in vator.tv that it had passed the five million member mark. On October 4 2019, Andrew Orr reported in macobserver.com that MeWe had passed the six million member mark. In December 2019, MeWe announced it would be introducing a premium tier for $4.99 a month. It also announced a separate two-tiered business line for enterprise collaboration with a suite of services including voice and video conferencing, end-to-end encrypted chat, and integrations with Office 365. Reception According to Google Play, MeWe was the top trending social media app in its store in December 2018. MeWe claimed 300 percent growth in the number of users in 2018. The company said it was adding 30,000 members every day (even though it was not advertising). This is likely primarily caused by the site marketing itself to the Google+ userbase, as Google had recently undergone a data breach which revealed plans of ending the site. In a 2015 review of the beta-testing MeWe service, British writer John Leonard called MeWe \\"well-designed and pretty intuitive\\". There's an app too that functions reasonably smoothly. But he questioned whether the company's business model was a viable one. Andrew Orr, reviewing the site in April 2018, felt that service was a good one but that it did not have any advantages over existing social media sites. That, he felt, would make it difficult for MeWe to attract users. In 2019, science communicators Rachel Alter, Tonay Flattum- Riemers, and Lucky Tran wrote in a column in The Guardian that anti- vaccination activists, if banned entirely from mainstream social networking sites, may \\"go underground\\" by moving elsewhere, and that anti-vaccine figures \\"are already talking about moving their platforms to alternative sites like MeWe.\\" References ;Notes ;Citations Category:2012 establishments in California Category:Alt-tech Category:American social networking websites Category:Android (operating system) software Category:Companies based in Culver City, California Category:Companies' terms of service Category:Internet properties established in 2012 Category:IOS software Category:Multilingual websites Category:Products introduced in 2012 Category:Proprietary cross- platform software Category:Technology companies established in 2012 ","title":"MeWe"},{"id":"60102633","text":"The Roman and Medieval Aqueducts of Patras () is an archaeological site in the city of Patras, West Greece. The Roman aqueduct is a major work of the Roman period in Greece and a vital part in the water supply of Roman-era Patras. Today parts of the aqueduct are visible around the short Patras' bypass road and the neighborhoods of Aroi and Asyrmatos. The aqueduct measured 6.5 km (4.04 mi) from the springs of Romanos to the city acropolis, today part of Patras Castle. For the greater part of this distance, the water passed through an underground channel, passing over valleys and gorges on carefully constructed archways, parts of which still stand. View of the Roman aqueduct in Asyrmatos neighborhood. History The Romans rendered Patras a Roman colony in 31 BC. The city was an important gateway between Greece and Italy, and the Roman architecture dominated the city completely. Roman emperors and city benefactors funded many public buildings and projects in the city with the aqueduct being one of them; a necessary infrastructure for the water supply of a populous city like Patras.https://www.gtp.gr/LocInfo.asp?InfoId=9&Code;=EGRGAH30KNZKNZ00031&PrimeCode;=EGRGAH30KNZKNZ00031&Level;=10&PrimeLevel;=10 Most probably during Hadrian's reign (117‚Äì138) the Romans built a large water cistern at the springs of Romanos in Mount Panachaiko, in the form of an artificial dam, part of which is incorporated today in the modern day water- tank. Several large pieces of that wall still remain in the region.https://ecotourism-greece.com/attractions/patras-roman-aqueduct/ According to an inscription found, Nymphs were worshipped at the location of the Romanos springs.https://www.minoan.gr/en/attraction/319/roman-monuments The aqueduct measured 6.5 km in length from the water cistern to the city's acropolis. For the greater part of this distance, the water passed through an underground pipe, passing over valleys and gorges on constructed archways, parts of which still remain today. According to foreign visitors of the city, the aqueduct was in a good condition still carrying water until the 17th century when the city incorporated a water pipe supply system, rendering its use obsolete. The monument today The construction of Patras' short bypass road was heavily delayed for more than 10 years due to the original planned path crossing the course of the Roman aqueduct. Furthermore, in 2006 an additional medieval aqueduct of the Ottoman period (15th-16th century) was discovered just a few hundred meters away from the Roman aqueduct. In order for the road works to continue, it was decided in 2009 to cut and remove parts the medieval aqueduct and transfer and exhibit them in the same place with the ruins of the Roman one. In September 2018 the mini ring road opened to the public, along with a small archaeological park called Roman and Medieval Aqueducts of Patras along its side where people can visit the unified aqueducts.https://www.academia.edu/11034108/Patras_Roman_Aqueduct_-Restoration Parts of both aqueducts still remain located in private properties, with the Roman one passing through houses' yards in the local neighbourhood of Asyrmatos.

History The Brixton Riot are a four-piece rock band from New Jersey that formed in 2006. The name is a reference to the 1981 altercation between police and residents of the South London neighborhood, as well as a nod to English rock band the Clash's song \\"The Guns of Brixton.\\" The band has often stated in interviews that the name was meant as \\"more of a sonic association than a social or political statement.\\" Their music draws comparisons to punk and indie rock bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s including the Replacements, Guided by Voices and H√ºsker D√º. Their first live performance was in February 2007, at The Loop Lounge in Passaic, New Jersey, which was followed later that Spring and Summer with additional shows, including an opening slot for the rock band Cracker, at Jenkinsons in Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey. Their debut release was a five-track EP titled Sudden Fiction, which came out on the band's short lived Tabbycat Records label, on 12 February 2008. It was recorded in December 2007, with Don Sternecker at his Mix-O-Lydian recording studio. Phil Rainone of Jersey Beat described the EP as \\"hooky bits of pop punk (the good stuff) [that] run rampant through all the tunes; so much so that I needed repeated listenings to absorb the clever lyrics and song imagery.\\" Their debut full-length, Palace Amusements, was released on 13 March 2012, and The Deli columnist Mike Levine describes the record as \\"good natured power pop that could only come out of my home state of New Jersey,\\" adding that \\"with its peaks and valleys, [it is] reminiscent of some of the Lemonheads' best work.\\" A review in The Aquarian Weekly says \\"in its entirety, Palace Amusements just flows from one solid song to the next without disappointing the listener [and] there really is a little bit of everything stuck into the DNA that makes up the disc.\\" Their song \\"Signal to Noise\\" inspired the name of the college radio station WFDU's popular indie-rock radio show hosted by Al Crisafulli, which shares the same name. The Brixton Riot appear on the 2014 Dromedary Records' compilation, From '93 'til Infinity. Mint 400 Records The Brixton Riot met Neil Sabatino through a mutual friend. and signed with the Mint 400 Records label in January 2017, and they released their second full-length, Close Counts, on 6 October 2017. It was recorded live on tape in twenty hours, over a course of two days. The record release party was held at Asbury Yacht Club with Dentist and the Rock N Roll Hi Fives, and hosted by CoolDad Music. The album was ranked No. 9 by Bob Makin in The Aquarian Weeklys Top Albums of 2017. That year they performed at the North Jersey Indie Rock Festival on 23 September, and their song \\"Can't Stop Now\\" appears on the Mint 400 Records compilation album, NJ / NY Mixtape. In 2018, the Brixton Riot contributed a cover of \\"Bring on the Dancing Horses\\" for the Mint 400 Records compilation album, At the Movies.

It is the highest grade of uncleanness, or defilement, and is contracted by having either directly or indirectly touched, carried or shifted a dead human body,Maimonides, Mishneh Torah (Hil. Tum'ath Met 1:7) or after having entered a roofed house or chamber where the corpse of a Jew is lying (conveyed by overshadowing). Grades of uncleanness The Mishnah describes several grades of uncleanness. The human corpse itself is the most severe of them all, known as the \\"Father of fathers of all uncleanness\\" (prime origin). The person who touches a human corpse contracts a lower grade of uncleanness, known as the \\"Father of uncleanness\\" (Avi HaTum'ah).Mishnah, Kelim 1:1 (in Danby's edition of the Mishnah, p. 604) Once he has been defiled, if he touches any other human being, or foods and drinks, he renders them unclean (defiled) at a second remove, making them contract a First-grade level of uncleanness.Babylonian Talmud (Avodah Zarah 37b), citing Numbers 19:22: \\"And whatsoever the unclean person touches shall be unclean.\\" The rabbis decreed that if a person defiled by the dead had touched another person, the person who had been touched is under a seven-day period of defilement, and cannot eat of Terumah or hallowed things until that period had expired (cf. BT Nazir 42b). A dead human's bone the size of a barley grain, and a dead human's severed flesh the size of an olive's bulk are enough to convey corpse uncleanness when touched or carried., s.v. Nazirut 7:2. Cf. Babylonian Talmud, Baba Kama 25b; Maimonides, Mishneh Torah (Hil. Tum'ath Met 2:4)Mishnah (Ohelot 2:3 [p. 652]) They do not, however, convey defilement by overshadowing. During the time of the Second Temple , those persons who were defiled by the dead and who had not yet purified themselves by the ashes of the red heifer followed by an immersion in a ritual bath were prohibited from entering the Court of the Israelites (inner court), located on the Temple Mount.Aharon HaLevi, Sefer ha-Chinuch, section # 362, on Numbers 5:1‚Äì3; Flavius Josephus, The Works of Flavius Josephus. Translated by William Whiston, A.M. Auburn and Buffalo. John E. Beardsley: 1895, s.v. Antiquities 3.11.3. The Mishnah (Kereitot 2:1) mentions four persons designated as \\"lacking in atonement\\" (), e.g. the leper, the man who had a repetitive and uncontrollable seminal flux, the woman who had a profuse menstrual flow of blood for several days beyond her period of natural purgation, the woman after childbirth (postpartum). Such people remain in a state of uncleanness until they have immersed and brought their sacrificial animals for atonement. Persons who are defiled by corpse uncleanness are similar to them, in that they, too, remain in a perpetual state of uncleanness until they can be sprinkled twice with the water of purification and immerse in a ritual bath (Sifrei on Numbers 5:1-3).Mishnah, Kelim 1:8 (in Danby's edition of the Mishnah, p. 606). There is a more lenient teaching in the Midrash HaGadol (Be'shelach) where it was learnt from Moses who carried with him the bones of Joseph that persons defiled from the dead were permitted to enter the Court of the Israelites and of the Levites (Moses being a Levite), but not the Court of the Priests. Today, in Jewish law, the same stringency is said to apply.Ovadiah Yosef, Questions & Responsa Yabia' 'Omer, part 5, responsum # 15, end of letter \\"beth\\"; ibid, responsum # 26; Ovadiah Yosef, Questions & Responsa Ye·∏•aveh Da'at, part 1, responsum # 25; Yitzhak Yosef, Yilq≈´t Yosef, Section Mo'adim, Hil. Chol Ha-Mo'ed, ¬ß4 Defilement by overshadowing Defilement by overshadowing (tumat ohel) applies to cases where the deceased person was of Israelite ancestry, but does not apply to corpses of Gentiles, unless physically touched.Babylonian Talmud (Yevamot 61a); Maimonides, Mishne Torah (Hil. Tum'ath Met 1:13; 9:4), ibid. (Hil. Avel 3:3); Tur / Shulhan Arukh (Yoreh De'ah 372:2) Where there were two houses divided by an adjoining wall and the corpse lay in one house (i.e. \\"overshadowed\\" by that house), if there was a hole or crevice in the dividing wall the size of a handbreadth in diameter, or what is approximately 8 cm. (3.1 inches) to 9 cm. (3.5 inches) (), defilement by the corpse passes to the other house as well.Mishnah (Ohalot 13:4‚Äì5) Any opening less than this defiles by a rabbinic decree. All liquids that came in contact with the airspace of that house are considered contaminated and must be poured out. A quarter-log of blood (equivalent to the volume of 1¬Ω eggs) from any dead human is enough to convey corpse uncleanness to a house if it came within the house., s.v. Sanhedrin 4b; , s.v. Hil. Tum'at met 4:1 Priestly laws A Jew who is descended from a line of the priestly class known as Kohen is not allowed to intentionally come into contact with a dead body, nor approach too closely to graves within a Jewish cemetery. An ordinary priest of Aaron's lineage is, however, permitted to contract corpse uncleanness for any of his seven closest relatives that have died (father, mother, brother, unwedded sister, son, daughter, or wife),Sefer ha-Chinuch (\\"Book of Education\\"), section # 263, Jerusalem: Eshkol Publishers; Leviticus 21:1‚Äì3 including a married sister by a rabbinic injunction.Babylonian Talmud (Mo'ed ·∏≤a·π≠an 20b) Jewish priests were especially susceptible to contracting corpse uncleanness, due to the unmarked graves in foreign lands. Since they were required by a biblical injunction to eat their bread-offering (Terumah) in a state of ritual purity, and they could hardly know if they had trampled upon an unmarked grave, this prompted the early rabbis to decree a general- state of defilement upon all foreign lands., Maimonides, s.v. ◊ï◊ê◊®◊• ◊î◊¢◊û◊ô◊ù Public roads in the land of Israel, however, were assumed to be clean from corpse defilement, unless one knew for certain that he had touched human remains., Eduyoth 8:4, s.v. ◊ï◊ì◊ô◊ß◊®◊ë ◊ú◊û◊ô◊™◊ê ◊û◊°◊ê◊ë (in commentary). Purification The impurity that is caused by the dead is considered the ultimate impurity, one which cannot be purified through the waters of an ablution alone (mikvah). Human corpse uncleanness requires an interlude of seven days, accompanied by purification through sprinkling of the ashes of the Parah Adumah, the red heifer.Numbers 19:11, 19:16 However, the law is inactive, since neither the Temple in Jerusalem nor the red heifer are currently in existence, though without the latter, a Jew is forbidden to ascend to the site of the former. All are currently assumed to possess the impurity caused by touching a corpse. Purification was required in the nation of Israel during Biblical times for the ceremonially unclean so that they would not defile God's tabernacle and put themselves in a position where they would become liable to extirpation (the act of being cut-off from Israel). An Israelite could become unclean by handling a dead body. In this situation, the uncleanness would last for at least seven days, until he could be purified again. Part of the cleansing process would be washing the body and clothes, and the unclean person would need to be sprinkled with the water of purification, without which he remains in a state of uncleanness and passes on defilement by touch to other persons.Sifrei on Numbers 19 See also * Prohibition of Kohen defilement by the dead * Impurity of the land of the nations * Ritual washing in Judaism *Tumah and taharah References Category:Jewish belief and doctrine Category:Jewish law Category:Jewish law and rituals Category:Jewish ritual purity law Category:Water and religion Category:Priesthood (Judaism) Category:Death customs Category:Judaism and death ","title":"Corpse uncleanness"},{"id":"60102724","text":"Pyranthus or Pyranthos () was a small town in ancient Crete, near Gortyna.

Family  Connor Tingley was born in Torrance, CA on October 7, 1993. He has a twin brother, Austin, who also lives and works in Los Angeles.  Early inspiration  Animation and character design was an early interest‚Äîone that was inspired by Pixar films. Tingley's growing skills and varied attention eventually led to the search for a mentor, and Tingley began an eight-year apprenticeship with illustrator and designer, Professor Sheldon Borenstein. Here, Tingley studied Florentine painting, anatomy, life drawing and Chiaroscuro lighting from age 10. Tingley spent his time observing, drawing, and studying a period of ‚Äúfundamental growth‚Äù that helped him to understand the construction of figures and nature.  Education  Following a lengthy mentorship, Tingley worked in toy design at Jakks Pacific and went on to ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, to study illustration with the intention to work at Pixar Animation Studios. Simultaneously, he was part of a creative collective with high school peers, designing a range of media assets for musicians and companies, and extensively travelling. Ultimately, he chose to leave ArtCenter and pursue a wide range of opportunities, which immediately involved touring, designing album covers, and providing creative direction for artists.  Exploring different art forms  His artwork appeared on the cover of Vogue Russia, captured by Swiss photographer Michel Comte in 2016. It was at this time that Tingley developed a collaborative relationship with legendary hairstylist Peter Savic, who famously created looks for Madonna. Through Savic, Tingley's work was introduced to French cosmetic founder and art director Francois Nars; Nars tapped the artist for his Marie Claire fashion feature in September 2016, which featured Tingley's hand-painted silk veils. Tingley and Nars collaborated on cosmetics released in 2019. Tingley's Los Angeles based creative agency, Cool LLC, designed packaging, identity and color palette for the collaboration. Tingley's solo exhibition in Bucharest on March 23, 2017 was held at Uzina Electrica Filaret. The premiere of the exhibition ‚ÄúRaw Intimacy‚Äù curated by Adrian Buga showcased 29 works along with a collaboration between Tingley and Savic. Tingley describes the paintings in the exhibition as having, ‚Äúa lot of translucent layers in which you can see bone and flesh. They metaphorically combine; there is nothing to hide.‚Äù  Recent exhibition  Tingley and Savic's latest collaboration is an exhibition at St. Michael's Church in Vienna on March 6. Titled, ‚ÄúThe Meat Series,‚Äù this exhibition features a series of paintings using hair as a medium. ‚ÄúTo create these paintings, we use hair to emulate and study the microstructures of the life‚Äôs pillars and in doing so we found the uncanny resemblance between the forms of hair and muscle fiber; between outside and inside, and between death and life,‚Äù stated Tingley. ‚ÄúUsing hair as our medium to explore shape, we let it fall on canvas, trusting nature's rhythm to emulate its natural design in the muscles‚Äô ripples, layers and form.‚Äù References External links * Celeb Buzz, This is How Kourtney Kardashian Decorated Penelope Disick's Bedroom * Hollywood Reporter, Lily Collins, Rain Phoenix Attend Art of Elysium's Charitable Art Auction * US Magazone, Cindy Crawford and Family Went As Punk Rockers for Halloween * LA Confidential Magazine, Artist Connor Tingley on Celebrities and Vogue * Vogue, This A$AP Rocky‚ÄìApproved Artist Brought His Eye to NARS‚Äôs Latest Must-Have Makeup Collection * Flaunt, Connor Tingley Clicked The Home Button Thrice, Now Everything's Nice * Vogue, Artist Mich√®le Lamy's Boxing Installation Packs A Visual Punch In Venice Category:1993 births Category:21st-century American artists Category:Living people ","title":"Connor Tingley"},{"id":"60102869","text":"USRC Surveyor has raised its boarding net as a hostile force of British Royal Marines close on the vessel. A boarding net is a type of rope net used by ships during the Age of Sail to prevent boarding by hostile forces. Designed to hang from a ship's masts and encircle its deck, the boarding net could be deployed during battle or at night when a ship was at anchor in unknown or hostile waters. In the Royal Navy, boarding nets first gained widespread use in the 1790s. A British boarding axe held by the National Museum of American History The crew of the Mary Rose were trapped aboard the ship by her boarding net as the vessel was sinking. Description and use The boarding net was a rope net that could be raised from a ship's masts so that it encircled the vessel's deck. A ship's captain could order the net deployed during battle if it became apparent that enemy naval infantry might attempt to capture his vessel through a boarding action; it might also be raised at night if the vessel was at anchor in unknown or hostile waters. Once deployed, enemy forces would be unable to gain access to the deck without first cutting through the heavy rope netting, a process that would slow them considerably, during which time they would be exposed to attack by the ship's defenders using standoff weapons such as firearms or pikes. To overcome the boarding net, boarding parties could be equipped with boarding axes ‚Äì lightweight hand axes designed to cut through rope. Observations and accounts According to the autobiography of George Pegler, while employed aboard the merchantman Blendinghall in the early 19th century he observed that the ship's boarding net was made of \\"ratlin rope with here and there a small chain running through its entire length, to prevent cutting by the enemy\\". When a French privateer engaged Blendinghall, the ship's boarding net kept the attackers from successfully gaining access to her deck. Francis Liardet's 1849 book Professional Recollections on Points of Seamanship suggests that a boarding net could be made more resistant to cutting by first covering it with tar. Royal Navy In the Royal Navy, boarding nets first gained widespread use in the 1790s, though were typically limited to use on ships of frigate-size and smaller, as ships of the line were unlikely to be targets of boarding in the first place. However, individual examples of naval vessels from the British Isles using boarding nets extend back at least to the Mary Rose in the 16th century. In the case of Mary Rose, the crew became trapped on the deck by the boarding net when she began taking on water, leading to the loss of almost all hands during her sinking. The SS Beaver, chartered by the Royal Navy to survey the coast of British Columbia, reportedly kept her boarding net deployed at all times \\"to prevent access by the natives otherwise than by the gangways\\". United States Navy The 1864 capture of the U.S. Navy gunboat USS Water Witch by the Confederate States Marine Corps was accomplished despite Water Witch's boarding net having been deployed, leading to a recommendation from the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron that ships be outfitted with wire boarding nets instead of rope ones.

Later investigation found that the driver had a lengthy criminal history and was driving without a license. Mendoza was posthumously promoted, and a foundation was set up in his honor. His death became a part of the broader public debate regarding US immigration policy. Death Mendoza died on May 12, 2014 in a head-on collision with Raul Silva-Corona, who had a blood alcohol content of 0.24%, or three-times the legal limit. Silva, 42, had driven more than in the opposite lane; several police officers had tried to stop or ram his vehicle. Silva, an illegal immigrant to the United States, had a criminal record dating back to 1994, which included charges for burglary and assaulting a police officer. He was convicted of a conspiracy charge, but missed his hearing sentence and lived as a fugitive. He was apprehended by the US Border Patrol in 2012. Following Mendoza's death, as Silva had no driver's license, law enforcement had difficulty determining his criminal record. Silva-Corona also died in the crash. Officer Mendoza, 32, and a 13-year veteran of the police department, was off-duty, having finished his work shift, and was driving his own car when he was hit. Mendoza was one of the first officers to volunteer to wear a body camera. Aftermath Mendoza was posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant.

She was the first lighthouse tender assigned to permanent duty in the Territory of Alaska.

Service history 1890‚Äì1898 Upon commissioning, Armeria was assigned to the 3rd Lighthouse District, with her home port at New York City. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War As U.S. relations with Spain deteriorated in 1898, Armeria was transferred to the United States Navy on 24 March 1898 for anticipated war service. She was converted for naval service ‚Äì including the installation of two guns ‚Äì at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in April 1898, and on 5 May 1898 Armeria was commissioned into U.S. Navy service under the command of Lieutenant Commander Leavitt Curtis Logan. She was assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron. In early June 1898, Armeria was operating off the north coast of Cuba with the armed yacht and the steamer when the gunboat misidentified them as a Spanish Navy squadron; the mistaken report delayed the departure from the United States of the United States Army's Fifth Army Corps for landings on Cuba by six days while U.S. Navy forces verified the actual location of Spanish Navy warships. As the war continued, Armeria made two voyages from the United States to Cuba carrying ammunition for U.S. Army forces fighting Spanish forces there. She arrived at Key West, Florida, on 9 August 1898 and the Navy transferred her back to the Lighthouse Board on 11 August 1898, two days before the war ended. Later service After her return to the Lighthouse Board, Armeria resumed her duties in the 3rd Lighthouse District. In 1907, she was reassigned to the 13th Lighthouse District in the Pacific Northwest. The U.S. Lighthouse Board was abolished in 1910 and replaced by the new United States Lighthouse Service, and she became part of the Lighthouse Service fleet. She was transferred to the 16th Lighthouse District at Ketchikan in Southeast Alaska in 1911, becoming the first lighthouse tender to be permanently assigned to operations in the Territory of Alaska. Loss Armeria was wrecked in May 1912 under circumstances related to the wreck that month of the barge Haydn Brown. Sources agree that the tug Pioneer cut Haydn Brown loose in the Gulf of Alaska during a storm and that Haydn Brown drifted for two days with Pioneer in pursuit before being wrecked on rocks at the southern tip of Montague Island on the coast of Southcentral Alaska with the loss of seven of the eight people on board.BOEM Shipwreck Table p. 106 Retrieved 1 March 2019alaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (H)alaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (A) They also agree that Armeria arrived on the scene and rescued Haydn Brown‚Ä≤s lone survivor but was herself wrecked soon thereafter. Otherwise, sources differ on the details of the wreck of Armeria. According to one source, Pioneer cut Haydn Brown loose on 10 May 1912, and Haydn Brown came ashore on Montague Island on 12 May; Armeria picked up the lone survivor from the beach on 15 May, but then herself was wrecked that day on an uncharted submerged rock off Montague Island while maneuvering after the rescue. According to this version of events, the steamer Admiral Sampson responded to Armeria‚Ä≤s distress signal and rescued Armeria‚Ä≤s entire crew of 36 plus the Haydn Brown survivor she had taken aboard. In a different account of events, other sources claim that Pioneer cut Haydn Brown loose on 16 May, that Haydn Brown was wrecked on Montague Island on 18 May, and that Armeria successfully rescued Haydn Brown‚Ä≤s lone survivor; Armeria then proceeded to Cape Hinchinbrook Light near the south end of Hinchinbrook Island off Southcentral Alaska to deliver coal and supplies and was herself wrecked when she struck an uncharted submerged rock off Hinchinbrook Island on 20 May 1912. In this version of events, the lighthouse crew assisted the crew of Armeria and Haydn Brown‚Ä≤s lone survivor in getting ashore on Hinchinbrook Island, and Admiral Sampson picked them up there. Regardless of the date and location of Armeria‚Ä≤s demise, some of her $70,000 cargo of coal, buoys, and supplies was salvaged. However, Armeria herself ‚Äì valued at $344,000 ‚Äì was deemed a total loss, and her wreck was sold at auction.

The novel was generally well-received, with one contemporary reviewer favorably comparing Barker to the likes of Clark Ashton Smith and Jack Vance. The novel was praised for its setting, intrigue and the atmosphere of ancientness, although its plotting and characterization have been criticized as weak. Its commercial performance was less impressive. According to one source, The Man of Gold had a print run of 15,000, about half of which failed to sell.

Plot summary Priestling Harsan has grown up among the non-human P√© Ch√≥i and is regarded a clanless bastard. He lives in monastic seclusion with other priests of Thumis, the god of knowledge, and specializes in esoteric languages. Harsan is summoned by the high-priests of the Tsoly√°ni Empire to translate ancient manuscripts that describe a counterplay to the ‚Ä≤Weapon Without Answer‚Ä≤ ‚Äî a high-tech device of old, utilized by the hostile empire of Y√°n K√≥r. Harsan embarks a quest to recover the Man of Gold before it is too late, traversing much of Tsoly√°nu as he follows various leads and evades the machinations of extra-dimensional aliens and rival factions within the Tsol√Ωani aristocracy. During his travels, Harsan manages to charm two young ladies of considerable beauty and wildly incompatible personalities. Ultimately, the Man of Gold is discovered and the Y√°n K√≥ryani designs of conquest are averted for the time being. A pariah no more, Harsan is accepted into the Tsoly√°ni high society and awarded a noble rank for his feats. The story closes as he marries his sweethearts and wonders whether the two will ever learn to tolerate each other.  Analysis  The character of Harsan resembles Barker in some ways as both are professional linguists.Jared: M.A.R. Barker, Emperor of the Petal Throne. Pornokitsch, 7 December 2017.

A website dedicated to T√©kumel collecting comments that the pacing issues reflect Barker's inexperience as a novelist. A retrospective review, originally published on RPGnet in 1999, awarded the novel high points for substance but less so for style, criticizing its clich√©d, clumsily constructed narrative, MacGuffin-driven action, and unsatisfying finale. Another source of criticism is a scene where a female character is tortured in a bizarre and highly sexualized manner. Nonetheless, the setting with its political machinations and remnants of ancient civilizations is \\"beyond compare\\", making The Man of Gold a worthy read.Ex- RPGNet Review ‚Äì T√©kumel: The Man of Gold.

Another retrospective review, posted on the genre fiction blog Pornokitsch, describes The Man of Gold as \\"a curiously unadventurous adventure\\", noting Harsan's \\"naive but reckless\\" personality and his tendency to drift from one encounter to another without conscious agency. While the story and its characters are bland, the world of T√©kumel is awe-inspiring. Rather than \\"a stand-alone piece of entertainment,\\" The Man of Gold should be approached \\"as a part of an educational process,\\" offering an accessible introduction to Barker's fictional universe and inviting the reader to dream T√©kumelani adventures of his or her own.Jared: The Man of Gold by M.A.R.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999|page=20 From a seldom-visited trail, there are views across the Great Valley of Virginia toward Purgatory Mountain and Peaks of Otter to the east, and Spesard Knob and Sinking Creek Mountain to the north. The area is part of the Craig Creek Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 5 miles east of New Castle, Virginia. State Route Va 618 passes along the western side of the area, and Va 748 on the northeast. A powerline separates the area from the North Mountain wildarea on the south, and Va 748 separates the area from Broad Run wildarea on the north and west . The North Mountain Trail, Forest Trail 263, runs through the area along the ridge of North Mountain. The area can be accessed from US Forest Service Road 183 which passes along the north and western edge of the area.. Boundary of the Stone Coal Creek wildland as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe boundary of the wildland, as determined by the Wilderness Society, is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads in the vicinity are given on National Geographic Maps 788 (Covington, Alleghany Highlands). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Stone Coal Creek wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Catawba, New Castle, and Daleville. Natural history The area is within the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Section in the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. It forms an important wildlife corridor between the Broad Run wildarea to the north and North Mountain wildarea on the southeast. The area contains a few stands of old- growth trees. Topography The area covers both sides of the ridge forming North Mountain. Stone Coal Creek, on the northern border of the area, drains the eastern slopes of North Mountain and Broad Run Mountain. A tributary of Catwba Creek, Stone Coal Creek flows parallel to Va 748 to join Catawba Creek where Va 748 ends at Va 600. Catawba Creek flows north to join the James River. Sinkholes on the north side of the area are evidence for the possibility of Karst soils. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Stone Coal Creek was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Most of the area is designated ‚ÄúBackcountry-Non Motorized‚Äù. Along Broad Ruin on the northwest there are areas designated ‚ÄúEarly successional Habitat‚Äù, and on the southeastern side there are areas designated ‚ÄúDispersed Recreation Area‚ÄîSuitable for Timber Production‚Äù.

The Akima spline was published by Hiroshi Akima in 1970.http://www.leg.ufpr.br/lib/exe/fetch.php/wiki:internas:biblioteca:akima.pdf Method Given a set of \\"knot\\" points (x_i, y_i), where the x_i are strictly increasing, the Akima spline will go through each of the given points. At those points, its slope, s_i, is a function of the locations of the points (x_{i-2}, y_{i-2}) through (x_{i+2}, y_{i+2}). Specifically, we define m_i as the slope of the line segment from (x_i, y_i) to (x_{i+1},y_{i+1}), namely (y_{i+1} - y_i)/(x_{i+1}-x_i). Then, s_i is defined as the following weighted average of m_{i-1} and m_i: :s_i = \\\\frac{|m_{i+1} - m_i|m_{i-1} + |m_{i-1} - m_{i-2}|m_i}{|m_{i+1} - m_i+ |m_{i-1} - m_{i-2}|} The spline is then defined as the piecewise cubic function whose value between x_i and x_{i+1} is the unique cubic polynomial P(x) that satisfies the four constraints: P(x_i) = y_i, P(x_{i+1}) = y_{i+1}, P'(x_i) = s_i, and P'(x_{i+1}) = s_{i+1}. The Akima spline is a C1 differentiable function (that is, has a continuous first derivative) but, in general, will have a discontinuous second derivative at the knot points. An advantage of the Akima spline is due to the fact that it uses only values from neighboring knot points in the construction of the coefficients of the interpolation polynomial between any two knot points. This means that there is no large system of equations to solve and the Akima spline avoids unphysical wiggles in regions where the second derivative in the underlying curve is rapidly changing. A possible disadvantage of the Akima spline is that it has a discontinuous second derivative.

The idea for this program was devised at Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre and is currently being led by Dr. Marco Marra and Dr. Janessa Laskin. Genome instability has been identified as one of the underlying hallmarks of cancer. The genetic diversity of cancer cells promotes multiple other cancer hallmark functions that help them survive in their microenvironment and eventually metastasise. The pronounced genomic heterogeneity of tumours has led researchers to develop an approach that assesses each individual's cancer to identify targeted therapies that can halt cancer growth. Identification of these ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù and corresponding medications used to possibly halt these pathways are becoming increasingly important in the treatment of cancer. With the oncogenomic databases that currently recognize mutation and abnormalities in the genomic structure of cancer cells, DNA, RNA, and protein analysis can be used to assess these changes and identify drivers of cancer growth. By decoding the genetic information inside cancer cells, researchers hope to gather information which may help understands factors that are promoting tumour growth and develop strategies to stop tumour growth. Ideally, a catalogue of all somatic cancer mutations will be created in the future that can provide significant insight into the abnormal cellular pathways of cancer cells and the genetic patterns that may be driving specific cancer phenotypes. The use of this information will help develop effective personalized treatment options for patients with resistant cancers and ideally prevent toxicities related to conventional chemotherapeutics.  History  The novel approach of comparing a patient's tumour versus normal tissue was first identified in 2010 when assessing the genetic evolution of adenocarcinomas of tongue before and after treatment was received. This study presented evidence that the genetic information from these tumours have potential to influence the treatment options for cancers. After identifying the driver mutations of tumour was the RET oncogene, the patient was administered with a RET inhibitor (sunitinib), which stabilized the disease for 4 months. A second round of RET inhibitors (sorafenib and sulindac) administration provided an additional 3 months of disease stabilization before the cancer progressed again. The observed mutations and amplification in the recurring metastasis were identified to be consistent with resistance to the RET inhibitors. The evolution of the adenocarcinoma after treatment with RET inhibitors demonstrated with possibility for personalized cancer therapy. This approach was then successfully replicated in other cancer types and resulted in the formation of the Personalized Onco-Genomics Program at the BC Cancer Agency. This program has now analyzed over 570 adult cancer patients with incurable disease, which were published in a landmark study in 2020.  Data availability  Genomic and transcriptomic sequence datasets from the 2020 Nature publication encompassing the first 570 \\"POG\\" patients have been deposited at the European Genome‚Äìphenome Archive (EGA, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/) as part of the study EGAS00001001159. Data on mutations, copy changes and expression from tumour samples in the POG program organized by OncoTree classification (http://oncotree.mskcc.org) are also accessible from https://www.personalizedoncogenomics.org/cbioportal/. The complete small mutation catalog and gene expression TPMs are available for download from http://bcgsc.ca/downloads/POG570/.  Rationale  OMICS technologies are high-throughput methods that help evaluate and unbiased investigate characteristics of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. A genome is the complete collection of an organism's DNA sequences, which contains instructions for cellular processes. In human diploid cells, 6 billion DNA base pairs of the genome can be found in the nucleus. The development of all cancers starts with a single cell accumulating enough harmful changes in DNA sequence that allow it to proliferate uncontrollably. Subsequently, the origin cell's fast-growing progeny invade surrounding tissues, migrate to other tissues. In a typical tumour, several dozens of somatic mutations may be disrupting the normal function of proteins. The majority of somatic mutations are mere byproducts of the unstable cancer genome and do not enhance the tumour cell growth. Usually, between two and eight driver mutations, mutations that gives cancer cells growth advantages, are found amongst all the somatic mutations a tumour sample. Driver mutations may be actionable as they serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cancer, and may have therapeutic implications. For instance, kinase inhibitors can be treating tumours associated with driver mutations in kinases. Axitinib, gefitinib, and dabrafenib to are used to treat adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-small-cell lung cancer, and melanoma respectively. As cancer can arise from countless different genetic mutations and a combination of mutations, it is challenging to develop a cure that is appropriate for all cancers, given the genetic diversity of the human population. To provide and develop the most appropriate genetic therapy for one's cancer, personalized oncogenomics has been developed. By sequencing a cancer patient's genome, a clinical scientist can better understand which genes/part of the genome have been mutated specifically in that patient and a personalized treatment plan can potentially be implemented.  Methods   Whole Genome Analysis  With the advent of next-generation sequencing, the genome-wide sequencing analyses have been made more accessible to thoroughly understand the genetics of each patient's cancer. Genetic material from tumour biopsies can be analyzed by two genome-wide approaches: whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). By developing tools to analyze these extensive sequence data, scientists have begun to comprehend how diseases, including cancer, can be attributed by genes and intergenic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs). Although more expensive than WES, whole genome sequencing allows clinical scientists to understand how cancer can be caused by alterations in a genome including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), SNPs and CNVs. Since WES samples only the exome (the collection of known coding regions of the genome) alterations in the non-coding region of the genome will not be detected by WES. Non-coding regions, including untranslated regions, introns, promoters, regulatory elements, non-coding functional RNA, repetitive regions, and mitochondrial genomes, make up 98% of the human genome, the function of most regions remains unexplored. Although these methods are useful in finding shorter variants, they are limited by read lengths of sequencing technology and are unable to detect large indels and structural variants. Though variants in a non-coding region are not uncovered by WES, both approaches identify all mutations that are known to cause cancer in a given patient and have been helpful in identifying low frequency and rare pathogenic (disease-causing) variants. However, the challenge remains in analyzing all the genetic variations in a genome for the clinical significance (whether a mutation is disease-causing as not all mutations are harmful) as much of the genome is not thoroughly understood, and new variants are still being discovered. To better understand the pathogenicity of all possible genomic variants to interpret WES/WGS data, researchers are systematically studying genome-wide sequencing data across many tumour genomes. Whole exome sequencing has been the conventional data used by international cancer genome research programs such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). These studies have accumulated WES data for all types of human tumours and have been an open resource for clinical scientists. Systematically analyzing more than 50,000 tumour genomes has elucidated new cancer genes and pathways, opening up new pursuits for pharmaceutical companies. Researchers have also discovered general trends on different types of cancer that may inform public education on proactive preventative measures. For example, more somatic mutations in coding regions are found in carcinogen-exposed cancers than in pediatric tumours and leukemia. Although these systematic studies provide extensive mutational data on coding regions, information is limited on somatic mutations in non-coding regions. Researchers have only recently started to be illuminated on how cancer may be caused by variants in the non-coding regions of the genome. In 2018, Zhang and colleagues analyzed 930 tumour whole genomes with associated transcriptomes (collection of mRNA transcripts) to show mutations in 193 non-coding sequences disrupt normal gene expression. Notably, they repetitively found noncoding mutations affected DAAM1, MTG2, and HYI transcription wherein DAAM1 expression initiate invasive cell migration in the tumour. Since the core somatic gene expression network is defective in 88% tumours, Zhang et al. suggested that noncoding mutation may have a widespread impact in cancer. As the cost of sequencing decreases and sequence analytic pipeline optimizes, researchers are looking to expand cancer genomic knowledge with WGS. Nonetheless, WES may remain effective for clinical diagnosis in the next few years as WES results are obtained faster.  Application  Treatment options for aggressive metastatic cancer typically have a poor response rate to conventional treatments. Through this novel approach, analysis of oncogenic factors is undertaken to identify the unique molecular signatures of the individual's tumour. In most cancers, there are multiple pathways that are altered and lead to disease growth and progression. The pathways can vary from person to person, and even between different sites of disease in a single person. These pathways also have the ability to evolve depending on the various treatment options attempted to halt progression. The POGs program takes biopsies from metastatic tumours from patients, sequences both the DNA and RNA, and then research what is driving the person's cancer in an attempt to pick the right drug for the right person at the right time. Recognition of specific genetic abnormalities that are promoting cancer progression can help select non-conventional treatment options to target these abnormalities. This approach allows multiple clinicians to work together in a collaborative manner to tackle an aggressive disease. The genetic information collected from the tumour helps health-care professionals make rational clinical decisions regarding treatment strategies. These strategies may be used to target the growth of the tumour, identify potential clinical trials that patients could enrol in, and find more effective and less toxic drug options. This approach has been successful in treating small subgroups of cancers with medication commonly used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Imatinib targets a BCR- ABL translocation that appears in more than 95% of CML cases. The success of this drug in treating CML has highlighted the importance of personalized treatment options and identification of molecular pathways to be targeted. Imatinib is now also used to treat some stomach cancers after identifying the genetic alterations in this cancer type. Repurposing current treatment options that are used for other treatments and can halt cancer progression due to similarities in characteristics. The success of the POGs program is highlighted by the identification of a novel genetic mutation in a 35-year-old recurrent breast cancer patient. Zuri Scrivens was enrolled in the POGs program at the BC Cancer agency to help devise a personalized novel therapy based on her tumour mutations. From the results of her tumour genome sequencing analysis, a drug that is most commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes was selected to treat her recurrence along with a standard chemotherapy medication. With the combination of these medications, Zuri's cancer quickly returned into remission. In the future, the use of this personalized onco-genomics approach may be the first step for the treatment of each person's cancer. There is a great depth of genetic information that can be extracted from each individual's cancer. Genomic data can provide valuable information regarding each individuals‚Äô cancer and guide clinical decision- making from health-care professionals.  Challenges  There are multiple challenges that are preventing the adoption of POGs. The largest challenge is the identification of genetic factors that are promoting cancer growth. These ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù need to be understood before any actions can be taken against them. Although the costs of genetic testing have decreased significantly, the results can provide an enormous amount of genetic information that scientists haven't truly understood yet. Through the understanding of these ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù of the cancer growth, appropriate drug choices can be made to target them. Only a fraction of these drivers have been identified until now and more research is required help uncover many of cancer's characteristics. Cancer cells are known for the thousands of genetic changes that are occurring within a single cell. Targeting these genetic changes requires a significant amount of research to identify which changes are drivers and which are ‚Äúpassengers‚Äù. These passengers do not directly to cancerous growth. Unfortunately, medication is not currently available for every genetic change that may occur within a cancer cell and drive growth. With further research, more medications will be made and identified to target these genetic changes. Another challenge with POGs is identifying new methods to overcome resistance from drug treatment. Some medications that are used to target cancers containing genetic changes cannot provide sustained benefits. Patients may experience either short-lived or long-term benefits from the medication, but since cancer is constantly evolving, it often develops even more genetic changes that allow it to adapt and survive against the drug. This drug resistance allows the cancers to grow back despite previously effective treatment. This has become a major challenge in treating cancers. The POGs and other new cancer treatments are generally tested on patients with advanced cancers who have failed previous drug therapy. With time, cancer progresses and evolves based on the previous treatments the individual has received. These cancers are incredibly difficult to treat due to their drug resistance mechanisms. There is a growing acceptance that these new medications need to be tested in individuals much earlier so cancer does not have time to develop with resistance. As mentioned above, the development of liquid biopsies help provide patients with the right drug at the right time. A non-invasive method to help clinicians influence clinical decision making could become the basis of new clinical trials in the future. The feasibility of undertaking this approach in all cancer centers remains one of the greatest challenges of any personalized program. Until it is feasible for every hospital and cancer center to have the technology required to study the genomics of each individual, it is unlikely that this approach will be adopted. Before many of the tests described above become commonly used, researchers also need to demonstrate that these test can provide benefit when guiding treatment options, and if this approach ultimately increases the survival and prevents recurrence of cancers in patients.

The foundation looked for a suitable place in the Arendal area and chose a property √Ösen in Barbu, a location with attractive views toward Galte Sound (Galtesund), Arendal's shipping lane. The area was expanded with several purchased parcels, and the result was a park between the streets Gamle Songevei and Kystveien. An attractive park was created there in the early 1900s, with ponds, sculptures, lawns, flowerbeds, and a playground. The park became an attraction for the city's inhabitants. Concerts and other events were held, and the park was widely visited. However, the foundation's capital was not sufficient to build the Margarete Foundation's residence, which was not realized until 1955 with municipal grants. The original park is much smaller today. Some of it disappeared due to building and expanding the old age home, and some of it has become parking space, and a private outdoor area and building site for the ABBL/Kuviga Housing Cooperative. The foundation's statutes state that the property must be protected against future buildings disturbing its rural character. The foundation's archive is located at the Aust-Agder cultural-historical center.

History The oldest identified structure at Out√£o is a lighthouse and watchtower at the mouth of the Sado River that was erected by Jo√£o I in 1390. In 1572, during the reign of Sebasti√£o I, the watchtower underwent a major expansion and was surrounded by fortified walls and transformed into a fortress by Afonso √Ålvares. The fort withstood a siege by the Duke of Alba during the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580. Santiago do Out√£o remained loyal to Philip III until December 8, 1640 during the Portuguese Restoration War. The fort underwent a remodeling during the reign of Jo√£o IV beginning in 1643 in order to provide better defenses at the entrance to Set√∫bal's port. The fort's reconstruction was completed by 1657. In the 19th century, the fort was decommissioned and transformed into a prison. By 1890, Santiago do Out√£o was again transformed, this time into a summer palace for Carlos I. From 1900 until 1909, the fort was utilized as a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis.

This is the fourth courthouse to built on this land. It was designed by architect Frank P. Milburn in Beaux Arts style. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The first courthouse was built in 1787. There are very few details on this courthouse and for reason's unknown, it was rebuilt in 1799. The first courthouse was built when Bourbon County was formed, then part of Virginia. Courthouse Number 2 was completed in 1799, seven years after Kentucky became a state. The second courthouse was designed and built by John & Thomas Metcalfe. Thomas Metcalfe (Kentucky politician) was the 10th governor of Kentucky, but was also a particularly skilled stonemason, earning the name \\"Old Stonehammer\\". This courthouse was destroyed by fire in 1872, reportedly at the hands of arsonists. Courthouse Number 3 was constructed rather quickly in 1873, this time in French-Renaissance style building. Once completed, it was equipped with a clock and bell tower rising 113 feet into the sky. Its construction included a mansard roof, and was constructed of brick with iron cornices. Its size proved to be a disadvantage when a fire broke out in 1901. The size prevented ladders and water from reaching to the upper floors where the fire began. An important note about this particular courthouse is that all of the documents survived the fire due to being locked in fireproof vaults. During this fire, many courthouse workers reportedly ran into the burning building and moved carts, and shelves of important documents into the large vaults and locked them so they would be safe. The vaults had, up until that day been locked each night, but for some reason had not been the night of the fire. The cause of this fire is still a mystery. Courthouse number 4, the courthouse that stands today, was completed in 1905 and is said to be the grandest of all Kentucky County Courthouses. The design for the current courthouse was created originally by the architect as a proposal for a new Kentucky state capitol building in Frankfort, Kentucky. A drawing was published in 1903 in a brochure supporting placement of the capitol in Frankfort. The new state capitol was in fact built in a design by Frank Mills Andrews instead, but Milburn recycled his design for this building two years later, with some reductions. With It is included also in the Paris Courthouse Square Historic District.

Previn won four Academy Awards for his film work and ten Grammy Awards for his recordings (and one more for his Lifetime Achievement). Recordings Previn's discography contains hundreds of recordings in film, jazz, classical music and contemporary classical music. Because of the huge number of recordings, the following lists are necessarily highly selective. A full discography (including LP/CD record codes) is available in Fr√©d√©ric D√∂hl: Andr√© Previn.

Film music  Most of the films which incorporate Previn's music are still available as videos/DVDs and/or as soundtrack records. Some of his soundtracks have been reissued in recent years, including those from Elmer Gantry, Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , Inside Daisy Clover, and Dead Ringer.  Jazz recordings Previn made dozens of jazz recordings as both a leader and sideman, primarily during two periods of his career: from 1945 to 1967, and then again from 1989 to 2001, with just a handful of recordings in between and afterward (while he focused his career on conducting/recording classical music, and later on composing contemporary art music). Previn also did several crossover recordings with classical singers like Eileen Farrell, Leontyne Price or Kiri Te Kanawa, too, as well as several Easy-Listening records with piano and orchestra in the 1960s (beginning with Like Young. Secret Songs for Young Lovers, 1959. with David Rose and His Orchestra). Like Oscar Peterson, whom Previn admired a great deal,Fr√©d√©ric D√∂hl: Andr√© Previn. Musikalische Vielseitigkeit und √§sthetische Erfahrung, Stuttgart 2012, p. 127. and Bill Evans, Previn worked a lot as a trio pianist (usually with bass and drums). Following his performance on Shelly Manne's recording Modern Jazz Performances of Songs from My Fair Lady in 1956, Previn released several albums of jazz interpretations of songs from broadway musicals as well as several solo piano recordings focussed on the songbooks of popular composers (Andr√© Previn Plays Songs by Vernon Duke, 1958; Andr√© Previn Plays Songs by Harold Arlen, 1960; Ballads. Solo Jazz Standards, 1996; Alone: Ballads for Solo Piano, 2007), the late recording of songs by Harold Arlen with singer Sylvia McNair and bass player David Finck (Come Rain or Shine. The Harold Arlen Songbook, 1996), and his TV shows with Oscar Peterson (1974) which Marlon Brando simply called \\"one of the greatest hours I ever saw on television\\"As quoted in Fr√©d√©ric D√∂hl: Andr√© Previn. Musikalische Vielseitigkeit und √§sthetische Erfahrung, Stuttgart 2012, p. 16. and Ella Fitzgerald (1979) respectively.

Just a few of Previn's recordings deal with music before Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (both favourites of Previn's programmes) or contemporary avant- garde art music based on atonality, minimalism, serialism, stochastic music etc. Instead, in 20th-century music Previn's repertoire highlights specific composers of late romanticism and modernism like Samuel Barber, Benjamin Britten, George Gershwin, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Sergei Prokofiev, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Maurice Ravel, Dmitri Shostakovich, Richard Strauss, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Harold Shapero and William Walton.

When the diameter becomes smaller than 1 micron, the corresponding structures are called fullerene nanowhiskers or fullerene nanotubes. Fullerene whiskers and tubes are held together by weak van der Waals forces, and hence are very soft. They can be grown by precipitation at an interface between two liquids. They are semiconductors and have potential uses in field-effect transistors, solar cells, chemical sensors, and photocatalysts. When doped with alkali metals, such as potassium, they become superconductors. As-grown fullerene nanotubes have hexagonal shapes and face-centered cubic crystal structures.

Background  The Venice Biennale is an international art biennial exhibition held in Venice, Italy. Often described as \\"the Olympics of the art world\\", the Biennale is a prestigious event for contemporary artists known for propelling career visibility. The festival has become a constellation of shows: a central exhibition curated by that year's artistic director, national pavilions hosted by individual nations, and independent exhibitions throughout Venice. The Biennale parent organization also hosts regular festivals in other arts: architecture, dance, film, music, and theater. Outside of the central, international exhibition, individual nations produce their own shows, known as pavilions, as their national representation. Nations that own their pavilion buildings, such as the 30 housed on the Giardini, are responsible for their own upkeep and construction costs as well. Nations without dedicated buildings create pavilions in venues throughout the city.  Organization and building  Architect M. Papandr√©ou designed the pavilion, which was built between 1933 and 1934. Brenno Del Giudice, who led the Biennale's Sant'Elena expansion, also collaborated on the project. The pavilion's simple layout includes a T-shaped hall. Greek and diamond patterns adorn the brickwork, and Greco-Byzantine pointed arches line the portico. The exhibitions at the pavilion are commissioned by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism.  Representation by year   Architecture  * 2018: \\"The School of Athens\\", curated by Xristina Argyros and Ryan Neiheiser, consisted of adjoining wooden steps with 3D-printed models of common spaces, such as Harvard's Carpenter Center (by Le Corbusier and Cambridge's courtyards. * 2010: \\"The Ark.

It is a spin-off of the Underbelly franchise, with various actors reprising their role from previous series. Commissioned by the Nine Network and produced by Screentime, it was broadcast between 20 and 27 April 2020. Cast The following cast members and characters have been confirmed: * Ella Scott Lynch as Nicola Gobbo * Gyton Grantley as Carl Williams * Hollie Andrew as Roberta Williams * Robert Mammone as Tony Mokbel * Rhys Muldoon as Terrence Hodson * Jacquie Brennan as Christine Hodson * Stephen Peacocke as Paul Dale * Richard Davies as Kevin 'Juicy' Jucirovic * Olympia Valance as Emma * Jane Harber as Susan Reichert * Les Hill as Jason Moran (archive footage) Plot Part 1 Opening during her days studying law at the University of Melbourne, Nicola Gobbo is arrested by police who raided her house and discovered drugs seemingly belonging to her housemate. Under pressure from police, she agrees to provide evidence against her housemate and avoids conviction as a result. Moving forward a few years, the Melbourne gangland killings were in full flight and Gobbo was building a strong reputation as a criminal lawyer. Her early clients include Tony Mokbel and Carl Williams as well as their associates. On top of her legal successes, Gobbo parties, socialises and becomes involved with her clients and their friends. Around this time Terence Hodson, a person heavily involved in the drug trade, faces a dilemma when his children are arrested and facing prison. He becomes an informant and develops a relationship with detectives within the drug squad, including Paul Dale and David Miechel. A while later, David Miechel (an off duty drug squad detective) and Terence Hodson rob a drug house in Oakleigh containing large amounts of drugs and cash after it is staked out by Paul Dale. They are arrested while fleeing the scene of the robbery and Hodson subsequently agrees to give evidence against Miechel and Paul Dale, the latter of which is subsequently arrested and jailed. During this time, Gobbo speaks to Dale on several occasions, both during and after his incarceration, though is not engaged fully as his attorney at this time. They hold a somewhat friendly, but mutually cautious relationship with each other. Shortly after, Terence Hodson's informant file is taken from the police station and distributed throughout the criminal underworld. Gobbo becomes aware of this and warns Hodson as well as speaking to the Ethical Standards department in an attempt to have them provide protection, but they state that Hodson has actively rejected all offers of any form of witness protection. Fearful, though remaining at home, Hodson and his wife are visited by their old friend Rodney Charles Collins, who indicates he is there for a friendly visit and manages to convince Hodson to let him in. Once inside, he forces Terence and his wife into their living room at gun point and executes both of them. The episode concludes with Gobbo at the Hodson's house, providing support for his devastated children. Part 2 Reeling from learning about the Hodson's murders and being devastated that she got so close to them Nicola goes to Reichert and tells her that she can give her and the police Carl Williams as Carl was leading the gangland wars, during this time Nicola speaks with Mr L and tries to get him to give up Mokbel and Williams as he refuses to help them, he finally does, but during this time Nicola is asked to turn Informer by Reichert which sets off a chain of events, including Mr L giving evidence to the cops which leads to Carl's arrest and Nicola's stroke. While recovering Mokbel gives Nicola a client to defend but the client Kipiani is sent to jail which makes Mokbel happy. But as the situation deteriorates even more Nicole meets up with Commissioner Simon Overland who tells Nicola she must meet with Paul Dale to see if he knows anything about the murders. Later on Carl is killed in prison by an inmate and the Hodson murder case falls apart and Dale is free to go on with his life, the commissioner and the police force comes to terms with Nicola's deal for recompense and agree to it, leaving Berich to tell Reichert if Nicola's informing came out crims would be screaming for release due to tainted evidence. The episode ends with a show of Carl's death, Mokbel appealing his 30 year sentence, Paul Dale never being charged, the Hodson's murders never being solved and Nicola's whereabouts unknown at the time.

Babji. A remake of the 1967 Tamil film Naan, it stars Krishna, Kanchana, Krishnam Raju and Nagabhushanam in the lead roles. The film focuses on a Raja's failed attempt to find his lost son, and three men who claim to be the lost son, seeking rights to the Raja's properties. Nenante Nene was released on 6 September 1968 and became commercially successful.  Plot  Rajkumar is the son of the Raja of Rangapuram. Annoyed by his father's feudalistic attitude, he flees to Rangoon where he is raised by a woman named Kamakshi. Years later, before dying, the Raja gives the job of finding his lost son to his three friends and his diwan, along with clues for identifying him. Three men ‚Äì Anand, Ravi and Bhushanam ‚Äì arrive at the Raja's palace and claim to be Rajkumar, seeking rights to the Raja's properties. Kamakshi is brought in to identify the real Rajkumar. Under duress, she testifies to her own son Anand as Rajkumar. Meanwhile, Ravi falls in love with Geetha, the diwans daughter. It is later revealed that Bhushanam is a CID officer trying to capture an underworld don who Anand works for. Ravi enacts a drama to save the real Rajkumar, who is in love with Ravi's sister Sarala. The film ends with Rajkumar being rescued and the culprits captured.

V. Chalam as the Raja's friend * Master Babu as young Rajkumar * Suryakantham as the Raja's friend * Sandhyarani as Sarala * Sriranjani Jr. as Kamakshi * Radha Kumari as Bhushanam's spouse  Production  Nenante Nene, a remake of the 1967 Tamil film Naan, was directed by V. Ramachandra Rao and produced by P. N. Babji under Sujatha Films. The dialogues were written by Bhamidipati Radhakrishna, who largely followed the original Tamil dialogues written by T. N. Balu while making some improvisations. Ramachandra Rao also wrote the film's screenplay, largely following the original Tamil version but making some changes, such as basing the character Kamakshi in Rangoon, unlike the original version where she was based in Colombo. Sriranjani Jr. reprised this role from Naan. Krishnam Raju was initially reluctant to play the negative role of Anand, having debuted in a heroic role in Chilaka Gorinka (1966), until Babji's brother Doondy advised him to accept the role as he needed to portray diverse characters to build a career in cinema. After industry elders and Krishnam Raju's friends, including cast member Krishna shared this view, he accepted the role. Cinematography was handled by S. Venkat Ratnam, and the editing by N. S.

History Fairweather was born in Adelaide, son of marine engineer Andrew Abercrombie Fairweather (1855‚Äì1940) and his wife Cecilia Russell Fairweather n√©e Leason (1851‚Äì1895), who married in 1879.Andrew A. Fairweather married again, in 1896, to Alice Louisa Kelly ( ‚Äì 1941) :James Leason (c. 1821 ‚Äì 29 July 1908) arrived in SA aboard Trafalgar March 1850 with daughters Clara and Emma, wife Emma and new baby having died en route. Leason then married Cecilia Wilson (c. 1823 ‚Äì 10 March 1910), had another ten children; Cecilia Russell Leason being the first. Leason took over \\"St James farm\\" at The Reedbeds in 1859 and prospered. He moved to Lillimur, Victoria (near Kaniva) in October 1877. Fairweather was educated at LeFevre's Peninsula Primary School and Port Adelaide High School, winning a scholarship in December 1895 which took him to Way College in 1896, from which institution he gained an entrance scholarship to Adelaide University, graduating BSc in 1901. He had his first experience in a working mine was underground at the Broken Hill Central mine, operated by the Sulphide Corporation, then in July 1904 was appointed to underground technical staff Broken Hill South Ltd's mine, eventually becoming underground superintendent. When general manager W. E. Wainwright moved to Melbourne in March 1920, Fairweather took over his responsibilities as mine superintendent. In 1932 he notoriously predicted the imminent exhaustion of the Broken Hill deposits and refused to waste shareholders' money on further exploration. In 1937 he succeeded Wainwright as general manager of Broken Hill South Ltd, and retired to the family home, Prescott Terrace, Rose Park, South Australia in 1944. He was president of the Broken Hill Mine Managers' Association from 1935 to his retirement in 1944. He was a longtime member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and elected its president in 1932. In 1945 he was awarded its bronze medal. He was a faithful servant of the Company, but respected by workers and the Unions for his honest dealing with the men and concern for their welfare.

The company describes itself as a purely defensive company, but several whistleblowers have alleged that it is involved in offensive cybersecurity (\\"cracking\\" or, colloquially, \\"hacking\\"), including on behalf of the Emirati government. Company history DarkMatter was founded in either 2014 or 2015 by Faisal al-Bannai, the founder of mobile phone vendor Axiom Telecom and the son of a major general in the Dubai Police Force. Around 2014, Zeline 1, a wholly owned subsidiary of DarkMatter, became active in Finland. DarkMatter's public launch came in 2015, at the 2nd Annual Arab Future Cities Summit. At this time, the company advertised capabilities including network security and bug sweeping, and promised to create a new, \\"secure\\" mobile phone handset. It promoted itself as a \\"digital defense and intelligence service\\" for the UAE. In 2016, DarkMatter replaced CyberPoint as a contractor for Project Raven. Also in 2016, DarkMatter sought smartphone development expertise in Oulu, Finland. DarkMatter recruited several Finnish engineers. By early 2018, DarkMatter's turnover was hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. Eighty per cent of its work was for the UAE government and related organizations, including the NESA. It had developed a smartphone model called Katim, Arabic for \\"silence\\". DarkMatter is an official provider for the Expo 2020. Recruitment practices In addition to recruiting via conventional routes such as personal referrals and stalls at trade shows (e.g. Black Hat), DarkMatter headhunts staff from the U.S. National Security Agency and has \\"poached\\" competitors' staff after they were contracted to the UAE government, as happened with some CyberPoint employees. The company has reportedly hired graduates of the Israel Defense Force technology units and is paying them up to $1 million annually. Simone Maragitelli, an Italian security researcher, blogged about DarkMatter's vague and dubious recruiting practices as a warning to others. He claimed that any questions or objections to the company's practices would result in being told that \\"things had been blown out of proportion\\" and that information about the job opening was extremely vague despite asking questions. F.B.I. Investigation DarkMatter is under investigation by the F.B.I. for crimes including digital espionage services, involvement in the Jamal Khashoggi murder, and incarceration of foreign dissidents. The F.B.I. is also investigating current and former American employees of DarkMatter for possible cybercrimes. It is not clear whether American officials have confronted their counterparts in the Emirati government about the ToTok app, a tool claimed to be used for mass surveillance. All sources have spoken out anonymously for fear of retribution. Allegations of surveillance for UAE government Project Raven Project Raven was a confidential initiative to help the UAE surveil other governments, militants, and human rights activists. Its team included former U.S. intelligence agents, who applied their training to hack phones and computers belonging to Project Raven's victims. The operation was based in a converted mansion in Abu Dhabi nicknamed \\"the Villa.\\" From around 2014 to 2016, CyberPoint supplied U.S.-trained contractors to Project Raven. In 2016, news reports emerged that CyberPoint had contracted with the Italian spyware company Hacking Team, which damaged CyberPoint's reputation as a defensive cybersecurity firm. Reportedly dissatisfied with relying upon a U.S.-based contractor, the UAE replaced CyberPoint with DarkMatter as its contractor, and DarkMatter induced several CyberPoint staff to move to DarkMatter. After this, Project Raven reportedly expanded its surveillance to include the targeting of Americans, potentially implicating its American staff in unlawful behaviour. Karma spyware In 2016, Project Raven bought a tool called Karma. Karma was able to remotely exploit Apple iPhones anywhere in the world, without requiring any interaction on the part of the iPhone's owner. It apparently achieved this by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the device's iMessage app. Project Raven operatives were able to view passwords, emails, text messages, photos and location data from the compromised iPhones. People whose mobile phones have been deliberately compromised using Karma reportedly include: * The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, plus his brother and several other close associates. * Nadia Mansoor, wife of imprisoned UAE human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor. (Nadia was nicknamed \\"Purple Egret\\" by Project Raven; Ahmed was nicknamed \\"Egret\\".) * British journalist Rori Donaghy. (Donaghy was nicknamed \\"Gyro\\" by Project Raven.) * Hundreds of other targets in Europe and the Middle East, including in the governments of Yemen, Iran and Turkey. In 2017, Apple patched some of the security vulnerabilities exploited by Karma, reducing the tool's effectiveness. Certificate authority controversy In 2016, two DarkMatter whistleblowers and multiple other security researchers expressed concerns that DarkMatter intended to become a certificate authority (CA). This would give it the technical capability to create fraudulent certificates, which would allow fraudulent websites or software updates to convincingly masquerade as legitimate ones. Such capabilities, if misused, would allow DarkMatter to more easily deploy rootkits to targets' devices, and to decrypt HTTPS communications of Firefox users via man-in-the-middle attacks. On 28 December 2017, DarkMatter requested that Mozilla include it as a trusted CA in the Firefox web browser. For more than a year, Mozilla's reviewers addressed concerns about DarkMatter's technical practices, eventually questioning on that basis whether DarkMatter met the baseline requirements for inclusion. On 30 January 2019, Reuters published investigations describing DarkMatter's Project Raven. Mozilla's reviewers noted the investigation's findings. Subsequently, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and others asked Mozilla to deny DarkMatter's request, on the basis that the investigation showed DarkMatter to be untrustworthy and therefore liable to misuse its capabilities. , Mozilla's public consultation and deliberations are ongoing. In July 2019, Mozilla prohibited the government of United Arab Emirates from operating as one of its internet security gatekeepers, following reports on the cyber-espionage program, which was run by Abu Dhabi-based DarkMatter staff for leading a clandestine hacking operation. In August 2019, Google blocked websites approved by DarkMatter, after Reuters reported the firm's involvement in a hacking operation led by the United Arab Emirates. Google, previously, said that all websites certified by DarkMatter would be marked as unsafe by its Chrome and Android browsers.

Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies. There is evidence that gut‚Äìbrain axis abnormalities may be involved. A 2015 review proposed that immune dysregulation, gastrointestinal inflammation, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, gut flora alterations, and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction. A 2016 review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism. Neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain. Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with cell adhesion. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development. Pathophysiology Autism affects the amygdala, cerebellum, and many other parts of the brain. Unlike many other brain disorders, such as Parkinson's, autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms. Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors. Just after birth, the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood. It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism. It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization. Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following: * An excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions. * Disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation. * Unbalanced excitatory‚Äìinhibitory networks. * Abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines, for example, by modulation of the neurexin‚Äìneuroligin cell-adhesion system, or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins. Disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy, which may explain why the two conditions are associated. The immune system is thought to play an important role in autism. Children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia. Biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as, deficits in social interactions and communication. Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is thought that activation of a pregnant mother's immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development. This is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism. The relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood; several have been investigated, with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport. The role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome, the most common identified genetic cause of autism, has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway. Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors. Also, some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases. The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.MNS and autism:  Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD. However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object. Autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain (yellow) for a movement task compared to a control group (blue). ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks. In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network (a large- scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing), with intact connectivity of the task-positive network (used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking). In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of self-referential thought. The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes. Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex. Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex. From studies based on event-related potentials, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli. For example, magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals. In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q21.1 deletion syndrome. Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 (15q13.3), chromosome 16 (16p13.1) and chromosome 17 (17p12) are inconclusive. Functional connectivity studies have found both hypo- and hyper-connectivity in brains of people with autism. Hypo-connectivity seems to dominate, especially for interhemispheric and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Neuropsychology Two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior. The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition. Simon Baron-Cohen's empathizing‚Äìsystemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize‚Äîthat is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain‚Äîbut are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing. These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier theory of mind approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the Sally‚ÄìAnne test for reasoning about others' motivations, and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis. However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints. The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the executive functions such as working memory, planning, inhibition. In his review, Kenworthy states that \\"the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial\\", however, \\"it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism\\". Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels. A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism. Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people. A related theory‚Äîenhanced perceptual functioning‚Äîfocuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals. Yet another, monotropism, posits that autism stems from a different cognitive style, tending to focus attention (or processing resources) intensely, to the exclusion of other stimuli. These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism. Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while most of the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties. A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.

The company was established in August 2018 to buy the Formula 1 racing assets of the financially stricken Force India Formula One Team. Following its acquisition of the team assets just before the 2018 Belgian Grand Prix, it competed in that race, and for the rest of the 2018 season, as Racing Point Force India Formula One Team, using the constructor name Force India. For the 2019 season the team was renamed as the Racing Point F1 Team and now competes using Racing Point as its constructor name. History The team's origins stemmed from the Jordan Grand Prix team, which entered Formula One racing in based at the Silverstone racing circuit. Jordan enjoyed many years in Formula One, winning four races and achieving third place in the Constructors' Championship. However, like many of the smaller teams in the 2000s, financial problems meant the team's performance dried up, and team owner Eddie Jordan sold the team to the Midland Group in early 2005. The Midland-owned team, renamed Midland F1 Racing in 2006, spent two seasons at the back of the grid, before owner Alex Shnaider sold the team to Spyker Cars midway through the season. Spyker F1 scored a point in 2007 and briefly led the ; despite this, the team once again hit financing issues, and was sold on to Indian businessman Vijay Mallya, then-chairman of the United Breweries Group, and Michiel Mol, Spyker's Formula One Director. The team, bought for ‚Ç¨88 million, was renamed Force India F1 for the 2008 season, and retained team principal Colin Kolles, Chief Technology Officer Mike Gascoyne, and driver Adrian Sutil. On 27 July 2018, after running Force India Formula One Team for eleven seasons, Force India Formula One Team Limited was placed into administration. By 2 August 2018 an investment consortium led by Lawrence Stroll, the father of former Williams driver Lance Stroll, and which included Andr√© Desmarais, Jonathan Dudman, John D. Idol, John McCaw Jr., Michael de Picciotto and Silas Chou, and supported by the team's senior management personnel, had set up a new company, Racing Point UK Limited, to use as a vehicle to save the team. By 23 August 2018, the new company had reached an agreement with the administrators to buy the team's motor racing assets and to secure the jobs of the 400 employees who worked in the team. The new company created a new constructor with the assets and entered the sport prior to the 2018 Belgian Grand Prix, taking the vacated entry of the original Force India team. The personnel roles remained largely unchanged in the new team, other than that of Robert Fernley, who stood down from his Force India role of deputy team principal, and Otmar Szafnauer who became team principal and CEO after being chief operating officer with Force India since 2010. 2018 Formula 1 season On 23 August 2018, the F1 governing body, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) reached an agreement with Racing Point UK that they could take over the Force India 2018 season championship entry, but they would not inherit any of Force India's 59 points or the prize money that they had accrued so far in the season. So, as the Racing Point Force India Formula One Team and using the constructor name Force India, the team entered its first Grand Prix, the 2018 Belgian Grand Prix which took place on 26 August 2018, with zero points. The original Force India's two drivers, Sergio P√©rez and Esteban Ocon, remained with the team and were able to continue their challenge for the drivers' championship, keeping all the points that they had already won in the season. The Racing Point Force India Formula One Team competed in the last nine Grands Prix of the season, amassing 52 points, and finishing seventh overall in the 2018 constructors' championship. 2019 Formula 1 season In November 2018, the company changed the name of its team to Racing Point F1 Team and the constructor name to Racing Point when it registered its 2019 entries with the FIA and they are considered as a different team to Racing Point Force India.

Plot  Thomas, a young man who's passionate about becoming a magic faces increasing pressure from his parents to get a regular job. A magic trick with swords goes wrong, putting his mother into the emergency room. She escapes with little harm. Thomas meets Monika, a nurse at the hospital who as it turns out is a neighbor. She asks Thomas to perform at a kids' birthday party at her home. When the magic show ends, Monika inquires where Thomas will be performing next because she is keen to attend it. Thomas impulsively says he will be performing at the 60th birthday celebration of his father next Friday. Now he has the task of persuading his father to let him perform on Friday. His father is very skeptical about Thomas' magic tricks because of the accident that sent his wife to the hospital. He relents when Thomas promises to get a regular job and agrees not to use swords. On the day of the birthday, Thomas, unbeknownst to everyone else hires an actor to join the audience. He invites this actor on stage to perform the sword trick. The trick goes wrong and it seems the actor has been killed or is at least grievously injured. However the actor gets up with a start. It becomes clear that Thomas and the actor were fooling the audience. Everyone, especially Thomas' father is relieved.  Reception and Awards  Instead of Abracadabra was well received by critics.

Bloom filters require much less space than other data structures for representing sets, however the downside of Bloom filters is that there is a false positive rate when querying the data structure. Since multiple elements may have the same hash values for a number of hash functions, then there is a probability that querying for a non- existent element may return a positive if another element with the same hash values has been added to the Bloom filter. Assuming that the hash function has equal probability of selecting any index of the Bloom filter, the false positive rate of querying a Bloom filter is a function of the number of bits, number of hash functions and number of elements of the Bloom filter. This allows the user to manage the risk of a getting a false positive by compromising on the space benefits of the Bloom filter. Bloom filters are primarily used in bioinformatics to test the existence of a k-mer in a sequence or set of sequences. The k-mers of the sequence are indexed in a Bloom filter, and any k-mer of the same size can be queried against the Bloom filter. This is a preferable alternative to hashing the k-mers of a sequence with a hash table, particularly when the sequence is very long, since it is very demanding to store large numbers of k-mers in memory.  Applications   Sequence characterization  492x492px The preprocessing step in many bioinformatics applications involves classifying sequences, primarily classifying reads from a DNA sequencing experiment. For example, in metagenomic studies it is important to be able to tell if a sequencing read belongs to a new species. and in clinical sequencing projects it is vital to filter out reads from the genomes of contaminating organisms. There are many bioinformatics tools that use Bloom filters to classify reads by querying k-mers of a read to a set of Bloom filters generated from known reference genomes. Some tools that use this method are FACS and BioBloom tools. While these methods may not outclass other bioinformatics classification tools like Kraken, they offer a memory-efficient alternative. A recent area of research with Bloom filters in sequence characterization is in developing ways to query raw reads from sequencing experiments. For example, how can one determine which reads contain a specific 30-mer in the entire NCBI Sequence Read Archive? This task is similar to that which is accomplished by BLAST, however it involves querying a much larger dataset; while BLAST queries against a database of reference genomes, this task demands that specific reads that contain the k-mer are returned. BLAST and similar tools cannot handle this problem efficiently, therefore Bloom filter based data structures have been implemented to this end. Binary bloom trees are binary trees of Bloom filters that facilitates querying transcripts in large RNA-seq experiments. BIGSI borrows bitsliced signatures from the field of document retrieval to index and query the entirety of microbial and viral sequencing data in the European Nucleotide Archive. The signature of a given dataset is encoded as a set of Bloom filters from that dataset.  Genome assembly  395x395px The memory efficiency of Bloom filters has been used in genome assembly as a way to reduce the space footprint of k-mers from sequencing data. The contribution of Bloom filter based assembly methods is combining Bloom filters and de Bruijn graphs into a structure called a probabilistic de Bruijn graph, which optimizes memory usage at the cost of the false positive rate inherent to Bloom filters. Instead of storing the de Bruijn graph in a hash table, it is stored in a Bloom filter. Using a Bloom filter to store the de Bruijn graph complicates the graph traversal step to build the assembly, since edge information is not encoded in the Bloom filter. Graph traversal is accomplished by querying the Bloom filter for any of the four possible subsequent k-mers from the current node. For example, if the current node is for the k-mer ACT, then the next node must be for one of the k-mers CTA, CTG, CTC or CTT. If a query k-mer exists in the Bloom filter, then the k-mer is added to the path. Therefore, there are two sources for false positives in querying the Bloom filter when traversing the de Bruijn graph. There is the probability that one or more of the three false k-mers exist elsewhere in the sequencing set to return a false positive, and there is the aforementioned inherent false positive rate of the Bloom filter itself. The assembly tools that use Bloom filters must account for these sources of false positives in their methods. ABySS 2 and Minia are examples of assemblers that uses this approach for de novo assembly.  Sequencing error correction  Next- generation sequencing (NGS) methods have allowed the generation of new genome sequences much faster and cheaper than the previous Sanger sequencing methods. However, these methods have a higher error rate, which complicates downstream analysis of the sequence and can even give rise to erroneous conclusions. Many methods have been developed to correct the errors in NGS reads, but they use large amounts of memory which makes them impractical for large genomes, such as the human genome. Therefore, tools using Bloom filters have been developed to address these limitations, taking advantage of their efficient memory usage. Musket and BLESS are examples of such tools. Both methods use the k-mer spectrum approach for error correction. The first step of this approach is to count the multiplicity of k-mers, however while BLESS only uses Bloom filters to store the counts, Musket uses Bloom filters only to count unique k-mers, and stores non-unique k-mers in a hash table, as described in a previous work  RNA-Seq  Bloom filters are also employed in some RNA-Seq pipelines. RNA-Skim clusters RNA transcripts and then uses Bloom filters to find sig- mers: k-mers that are only found in one of the clusters. These sig-mers are then used to estimate the transcript abundance levels. Therefore, it does not analyze every possible k-mer which results in performance and memory-usage improvements, and has been shown to work as well as previous methods.

He was also an active member of the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, also known as Mau Mau, during the struggle for independence against British colonists.  Early life  Gikubu was born in 1934 in Kiambaa village, around Banana Hill, Kiambu, to Sara Wanjiku and Gikubu Karanja. He was born in a polygamous family and was the fourth born in a family of twenty. He went to Independent School Muchatha, Kanunga Primary and later Riara Intermediate School. Before he completed his primary school education, Mau Mau uprising broke out and he joined the movement as a courier and errand boy. He later fled to the then Tanganyika after learning of his being sought for arrest by the colonial government. He was promptly arrested at the Kenyan border upon his return to Kenya and detained at the infamous Manyani Detention Camp. Due to his young age at the point of detention, in 1955 he was transferred to Wamumu Rehabilitation camp as a child prisoner, where he met Geoffrey Griffin, with whom he was later to co-found Starehe Boys' Centre & School.  Starehe Boys‚Äô Centre  Gikubu co-founded Starehe Boys' center and School with the late Dr. Geoffrey Griffin and the late Geoffrey Geturo.

Other risk factors include being in the military, prior domestic violence, and repeated banging of the head. The exact amount of trauma required for the condition to occur is unknown. Below is a list of notable cases of CTE in sports. American football Study of CTE's relationship with American football began in 2002. Since then, hundreds of players have been diagnosed posthumously with CTE, including a number of players who committed suicide. CTE has affected not only professional football players, but players who only played in college and in high school. In 2002, Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist and neuropathologist in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, found CTE in the brains of Mike Webster, Terry Long, Andre Waters, Justin Strzelczyk, and Tom McHale. Omalu, initially a medical examiner, then associate adjunct professor in California, was a co-founder of the Brain Injury Research Institute and reportedly in 2012 participated in the autopsy of Junior Seau. Omalu's participation was halted during the autopsy after son Tyler Seau, under pressure from the NFL, revoked previously provided oral permission. Tyler Seau had received telephone calls from NFL management denouncing Omalu's professional ethics, qualifications, and motivation when the league asked him to revoke Dr. Omalu's research. Research into football players with CTE has continued with neuropathologist Ann McKee of Boston University's CTE Center, who diagnosed the bodies of twelve former professional American football players with CTE postmortem between 2008 and 2010. An autopsy McKee conducted in 2010 on the brain of Owen Thomas, a 21-year-old junior lineman at the University of Pennsylvania who died of suicide, showed early stages of CTE, making him the second youngest person at the time to be diagnosed with the condition. Thomas was also the second amateur football player diagnosed with CTE; Mike Borich, who died at 42, was also diagnosed by McKee.Staff. \\"First former college football player diagnosed with CTE: Former Brigham Young University Football Coach Died at 42\\", Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, October 22, 2009. Accessed October 19, 2010. The doctors who performed the autopsy indicated that they found no causal connection between the early stage CTE and Thomas's suicide. There was no indication that Thomas missed playing time due to concussions; however, as a player who played hard and \\"loved to hit people\\", Thomas may have played through concussions and received thousands of subconcussive impacts on the brain.Schwarz, Alan. \\"Suicide Reveals Signs of a Disease Seen in N.F.L.\\", The New York Times, September 13, 2010. Accessed September 14, 2010. On May 2, 2012, retired twelve time Pro Bowler Junior Seau died of suicide with a gunshot wound to the chest. There was speculation that he had brain damage due to CTE.Smith, Michael David, \\"Boston researchers request Junior Seau's brain\\". NBC Sports Pro Football Talk, May 3, 2012. Retrieved 2012-05-03. Seau's family donated his brain tissue to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. On January 10, 2013, the brain pathology report was released, and Seau's brain showed evidence of CTE. Seven months after Seau's death, on December 1, 2012, Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher killed his girlfriend and drove to Arrowhead Stadium and killed himself in front of then GM Scott Pioli and then head coach Romeo Crennel. A year later, on behalf of Belcher's minor daughter, a family lawyer filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Chiefs, alleging that the team deliberately ignored warning signs of CTE, possibly leading to Belcher's suicide. The lawyer also hired a medical examiner to examine Belcher's brain for signs of CTE. On September 29, 2014, it was confirmed that he had CTE. Coverage of Belcher's murder-suicide, combined with the suicide of Junior Seau, drew national attention to CTE and its effects on the brains of football players. In September 2015, researchers with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University announced that they had identified CTE in 96 percent of National Football League players that they had examined and in 79 percent of all football players. By November 2016, 90 of 94 former NFL players were diagnosed post- mortem with CTE by McKee. Professional players diagnosed included eight-time Pro Bowler Lou Creekmur,Case Study: Lou Creekmur, Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. Accessed August 17, 2010.

In March 2016, former NFL running back for the New England Patriots, and Philadelphia Eagles, Kevin Turner died at age 46. In 2010 he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). After donating his brain to Boston University Brain CTE Center they diagnosed Turner with CTE. He had a severe case with CTE which killed him, not ALS. In April 2017, former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez died by suicide in prison at age 27. On September 21, 2017, an autopsy report from Boston University identified Stage 3 CTE in Hernandez's brain. Until Hernandez's autopsy, researchers had never seen Stage 3 CTE in a brain younger than 46 years old.Aaron Hernandez suffered from most severe CTE ever found in a person his age Adam Kilgore, The Washington Post, November 9, 2017 The Journal of the American Medical Association released an updated study in July 2017 reporting that out of 111 brains of deceased former NFL players studied, 110 (99%) had CTE. This also led to players retiring very early in their career. As of December 2018, 87% of the 202 American football players' brains that have been donated to Boston University tested positive for CTE. O.J. Simpson is suspected to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy. League updates The NFL has taken measures to help prevent CTE. In December 2009, the NFL changed its rules for the assessment of concussions and return to play after a possible head injury. The number of full-contact practice sessions teams run has been reduced, based on the 2011 collective bargaining agreement. In 2012, some four thousand former NFL players \\"joined civil lawsuits against the League, seeking damages over the League's failure to protect players from concussions, according to Judy Battista of the [New York] Times\\".Coll, Steve, \\"Is Chaos a Friend of the N.F.L.?\\", The New Yorker, December 26, 2012. Citing the Times. Retrieved 2012-12-27. In 2013 the NFL settled with a class action lawsuit. The NFL supposedly hid the long term effects of concussions. The NFL didn't admit hiding anything, but they gave money to retired NFL football players that suffered from brain related injuries from football. On August 30, 2013, the NFL reached a $765 million settlement with the former NFL players over the head injuries. The settlement created a $675 million compensation fund from which former NFL players can collect depending on the extent of their conditions. Severe conditions such as Lou Gehrig's disease and postmortem diagnosed chronic traumatic encephalopathy may be entitled to payouts as high as $5 million. From the remainder of the settlement, $75 million will be used for medical exams, and $10 million will be used for research and education. However, in January, 2014, U.S. District Judge Anita B. Brody refused to accept the agreed settlement because \\"the money wouldn't adequately compensate the nearly 20,000 men not named in the suit\\".\\"Judge scuttles NFL's $760M concussion settlement\\", MarketWatch citing NBC10 Philadelphia, January 14, 2014. Retrieved 2014-01-15.

Retrieved 2015-08-11. On April 22, 2015, a final settlement was reached between players and the NFL in the case adjudicated by Judge Brody. Terms include payments to be made by the NFL for $75 million for \\"baseline medical exams\\" for retired players, $10 million for research and education, as well an uncapped amount for retirees \\"who can demonstrate that they suffer from one of several brain conditions covered by the agreement\\", with total payments expected to exceed $1 billion over 65 years. On March 14, 2016, NFL's senior vice president of health and safety, Jeff Miller, publicly admitted that there is a link between football and CTE at the roundtable discussion on concussions. In an attempt to lower the number of helmet-to-helmet hits, which often leads to concussions and increases likelihood of brain injuries, the NFL changed its rules for helmet-to-helmet hits in the offseason of 2018. Ice hockey Athletes from other sports have also been identified as having CTE, such as hockey player Bob Probert. Neuropathologists at Boston University diagnosed Reg Fleming as the first hockey player known to have the disease. This discovery was announced in December 2009, six months after Fleming's death. Rick Martin, best known for being part of the Buffalo Sabres' French Connection, was diagnosed with CTE after his brain was posthumously analyzed. Martin was the first documented case of an ice hockey player not known as an enforcer to have developed CTE; Martin was believed to have developed the disease primarily as a result of a severe concussion he received in 1977 while not wearing a helmet. The disease was low-grade and asymptomatic in his case, not affecting his cognitive functions. He died of a heart attack in March 2011 at the age of 59.Golen, Jimmy (October 5, 2011).

Following his death, his sister wanted to know if he had any brain issues and was confirmed to have CTE. In 1989, Merril Hoge was a Pittsburgh Steeler when Zalapski was a Pittsburgh Penguin. The two were part of a civic helmet-safety campaign and posed for photos. A few years before Zalapski's death, his sister Kyla had reached out to Hoge to assist her brother who was struggling with his health to transition into retirement. In January 2018 former hockey player and captain for the Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs Andrew Carroll, committed suicide, at the age of 32. He was only officially diagnosed with a few concussions. After looking at Andrew's lab results, researchers at Boston University estimated that number was closer to 20. A little over a year later Andrew Carroll was diagnosed with CTE. In 2011, USA hockey, which controls the rules surrounding youth hockey in the United States banned body checking along with checking at the head or neck for kids who are ages 13‚Äì14 or younger. This is supposed to help prevent youth hockey players get concussions, and other injuries in youth hockey. In February 2015, Steve Montador died unexpectedly, and the subsequent examination of Montador's brain by doctors at Krembil Neuroscience Centre at Toronto Western Hospital found a \\"widespread presence\\" of CTE. Montador joins the growing list of former ice hockey players discovered to have CTE which includes Rick Martin, Derek Boogaard, and Reg Fleming. Some researchers have argued that prospective longitudinal studies, following subjects over time, are needed to completely understand the causes and progression of CTE. Professional wrestling In 2007, neuropathologists from the Sports Legacy Institute (an organization co-founded by Christopher Nowinski, himself a former professional wrestler) examined the brain of Chris Benoit, a professional wrestler with WWE, who killed his wife and son before committing suicide. The suicide and double murder were originally attributed to anabolic steroid abuse, but a brain biopsy confirmed pathognomonic CTE tissue changes: large aggregations of tau protein as manifested by neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, which cause neurodegeneration. In 2009, Bennet Omalu discovered CTE in recently retired wrestler Andrew \\"Test\\" Martin, who died at age 33 from an accidental drug overdose. On February 9, 2016, Daniel Bryan was forced to retire early due to signs of CTE and post-concussion seizures. He was medically cleared to wrestle again on March 20, 2018. After their deaths in February and April 2016 respectively, former ECW wrestlers Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney were found to have had CTE. In July 2016, 53 professional wrestlers, represented by Konstantin Kyros, filed a lawsuit against WWE, looking to hold the organization accountable for their \\"long-term neurological injuries\\" due to multiple concussions and CTE. In November 2017, as part of filing an amended version of the lawsuit, Kelli Sloan and Shirley Fellows were added to the class-action documents, as they represented deceased wrestlers diagnosed with CTE, with Sloan representing her father Harry (Mr. Fuji) Fujiwara and Fellows her son Timothy Well. Carole Snuka, initially part of the first filing, also used the second filing to note her husband, whom she represented in the litigation, subsequently died and was also diagnosed with CTE. The lawsuit was dismissed on September 14, 2018 by US district judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant. The appeal is pending, jointly from three cases, currently involving 67 professional wrestlers combined. According to a July 2019 appeal filed, six deceased wrestlers represented in the case were found to have CTE. Kyros noted Ashley Massaro, a seventh wrestler who has since died after she joined his class-action lawsuit, requested her brain be studied for CTE. Mixed martial arts It is believed that former mixed martial artists Gary Goodridge and James Leahy have CTE, as a result of repeated head trauma from their fighting careers. Delayed onset is becoming increasingly common as with Leahy, whose symptoms developed many years after any sporting activity.Fowlkes, Ben, \\"Gary Goodridge, former MMA fighter and kickboxer, offers cautionary tale\\", Sports Illustrated, March 15, 2012.

Canadian football On January 10, 2011, former AFL and Canadian football player through the years of 1956 to 1967 Cookie Gilchrist died. Gilchrist was diagnosed with stage four CTE by Boston University. Cycling In 2016, BMX biker and extreme sport icon Dave Mirra was diagnosed post-mortem with CTE. He died of suicide by gunshot on February 4, 2016, and his brain was examined by Lili-Naz Hazrati of the University of Toronto, who confirmed the diagnosis. In addition to the \\"countless\\" concussions he had during his career, his skull was fractured when he was hit by a car at 19 years old and he took up boxing after retirement. He became the first action sports star to be diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease. Rodeo In 2017, Ty Pozzobon, who at the age of 25 years also committed suicide, became the first professional bull rider diagnosed with the disease. Within ten years, he had received 15 head injuries and his first concussion at the age of 16.

He first appeared in the series eighteen episode \\"A Partnership, Literally\\", broadcast on 9 February 2016. Jason arrives at Holby City hospital to work as a porter after being introduced as the nephew of Consultant Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell). Robertson was cast after he impressed producers after auditioning against several other actors. Jason has Asperger syndrome and Robertson is the first non- neurotypical actor to play a non-neurotypical character in an ongoing role. Robertson has stated that his own experience with autism helped him portray Jason accurately. He is characterised as a nice man, who Robertson describes as \\"geeky and shy\\" and lacking a sense of humour. Jason and Serena were unacquainted and it takes time for her to accept Jason into her family. Jason is transformed from a character who needed full-time care in supported accommodation to becoming an independent adult. Jason stories have focused on his connection with Serena and working as a hospital porter. Jason also involves himself in medical cases on the Acute admissions unit. Producers created a relationship with Greta Allinson (Zoe Croft), who also has Asperger syndrome. The pair become parents to Guinevere, which Serena was initially apprehensive about Jason's ability to cope. Jason also suffered a ruptured liver after being run over by his cousin Elinor Campbell (Amy McCallum). Jason's inclusion in Holby City has prompted praise from autism charities such as the National Autistic Society and Ambitious about Autism. Rachael Sigee from the Evening Standard believed it was of the utmost importance that an autistic actor played the role. Juliet Rieden of The Australian Women's Weekly branded Jason a \\"breakthrough role\\" and a television first. The positive response to the character led him being developed into a long-term role. Casting The character and casting details were announced in February 2016. Robertson's agent secured him the audition which he attended in 2015 and competed with several actors for the part. He told Juliet Rieden from The Australian Women's Weekly that \\"I auditioned and I was so flawless and so smooth that they decided it was my shot.\\" Of his role success the actor, who has autism, said \\"I was really apprehensive but tinged with pride that I had been given this great opportunity. I was nervous about the challenge and did not know whether I would enjoy it but I was determined to do my best.\\" The actor began filming in October 2015 and he became part of the show's semi- regular cast. The cast initially had concerns about an autistic actor coping with fast pace nature of filming. Upon working with Robertson they witnessed his acting talent which quashed any concern. The series producer Simon Harper added that the actor was \\"a joy to have around\\". Robertson initially found working on Holby City difficult because he found it stressful and physically exhausted. He felt that after he filmed his first block of episodes that he became more relaxed and comfortable with the role. Like the actor, Jason has Asperger syndrome. Robertson is the first non-neurotypical actor to play a non-neurotypical character in an ongoing BBC drama. The actor said that he hoped his casting would make television producers more inclined to hire autistic actors. He added that \\"I'm hoping my character on Holby will inspire parents of kids that have autism or Asperger‚Äôs that their kids can make it as well.\\" Robertson's mother Kathy Lette said that securing the role helped her son's confidence and added that it showed those who had bullied Robertson because of his autism that they were wrong. In June 2016, it was reported that the character was working well and that Robertson would stay on the show as the character was further developed. Development Introduction and characterisation Jason was introduced as the nephew of Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell). After Serena learned that her long-lost sister was dead, she emailed Jason asking to meet him and he turned up at Holby during Serena's shift. Russell explained that Serena was only expecting a reply, but because of his Asperger syndrome he takes the message literally and shows up. Serena tries to understand his condition in the hope that they can build a relationship. Russell said that it was an story of uncertainty over Serena succeeding in understanding Jason and keeping him in her life. She added that it would be interesting to see how Serena's mistakes impact on Jason's life. A publicist from BBC Online describes Serena as becoming a \\"protective aunt\\" to Jason. Following his introduction Robertson received praise from viewers via the social networking website Twitter. He attributed this to his character's one liners stating, ‚Äúthe reaction has been really good, really positive. I get the best lines as well.\\" Robertson described Jason as \\"really nice and sensitive with a deadpan sense of humour and a genuine desire to do good\\". He also said Jason's Asperger's causes him to take things said to him literally, which does cause problems for him and Serena. Robertson added that his character was \\"more geeky and shy\\" than himself. The actor has stated that before filming he converses with the cast and crew about techniques to \\"present Jason as a human character.\\" The character has a different type of Asperger syndrome than the actor's condition. Jason also has an obsession with learning medical terms. While interviewed by Amanda Holden, the actor described Jason as \\"a very sweet young man, a very nice man\\" but felt he lacked a sense of humour. He also thinks that Jason lacks self-confidence. Job role and accident Victoria Wilson from What's on TV revealed that Jason would end up in Serena's care. The story begins when Jason's carer Allan Coalville (Geoffrey Lumb) collapses and is admitted to the Acute admissions unit (AAU). Jason is concerned for Allan's health and is upset when she confirms he has had a stroke. Following surgery Allan has another stroke and Serena saves his life. She tells Jason that Allan will no longer be able to look after him and she worries about abandoning her nephew. Jason later takes employment as a porter at the hospital. Serena's daughter Elinor Campbell (Amy McCallum) visits the hospital but Serena is too busy to entertain Elinor. Jason informs her that Serena is no longer the deputy CEO of the hospital. This causes an argument between Serena and Elinor, who gets in her car to drive off. Serena steps in front of her vehicle but Elinor does not stop. Jason pushes Serena out of the way and gets hit by the car instead. Jason has a ruptured liver and Serena's partner Bernie Wolfe (Jemma Redgrave) battles to save his life in the operating theatre. Bernie and Morven Digby (Eleanor Fanyinka) are successful in surgery and Jason survives. Serena thanks him for saving her life. Shortly after Elinor collapses and dies. Jason takes three months off work to recover from his injuries. Elinor's death effects Jason and he visits a grief counsellor. When Jason and registrar Xavier Duval (Marcus Griffiths) witness Sian Evans (Ajjaz Awad) thrown from a vehicle in the hospital car park, they go to help and discover a stab wound. Jason stems the bleeding by applying pressure with his jumper. Xavier thanks Jason for helping to save Sian, but becomes annoyed with him when he becomes fixated on helping with the rest of the case. Xavier loses his patience and angrily informs Jason that he is just a porter. They then discovers that the unconscious Sian has a baby, and Jason tracks down the car and helps reunite the mother and baby. Relationship with Greta Allinson Producers introduced a love interest for the character in 2018, Greta Allinson (Zoe Croft). The character also has Asperger syndrome. She is admitted to AAU where Serena treats her. Greta tells Serena she cannot treat her because she is Jason's aunt. It is then revealed that Greta is pregnant and Serena expresses her concerns about Jason's ability to cope. Greta confronts Serena telling her that she and Jason can cope with the child. Russell believed that Serena does not think Jason and Greta will cope because Jason needed full-time care when she first met him. Serena rethinks her stance and offers to help support them both. Serena interferes again when she presumes that Jason and Greta will move in with her following the babies birth. Greta becomes annoyed with Serena's overbearing nature. She confronts Serena and states that the family will live in her flat. She then realises that she is only interfering because she misses her partner Bernie, who now works in Nairobi. When Bernie returns from working in Nairobi, she asks Serena why she stayed on at the hospital. A Holby City publicist the told Tyler from Inside Soap that it was because \\"her nephew Jason and his other half Greta are due to have a baby - and heavily rely on Serena, of course!\\" Greta is then admitted to AAU again and Bernie tries to treat an uncooperative Greta. She declares that Bernie is Jason's family, which is unethical, which leaves Bernie \\"humbled\\". Despite this she diagnoses Greta with lactose intolerance and states the baby is safe. Greta later gives birth to a baby girl named Guinevere and a patient makes Jason worried about what would happen to his partner and daughter if he was to die. Harper teased the wedding during November 2018 and revealed that they had hired musician and priest Richard Coles to play Henry de Havilland, who would officiate the on-screen ceremony. Jason and Greta's service was due to be conducted by chaplain Lexy Morrell (Jenny Howe) who was impaled by a shard of glass when a church roof collapses. Jason enlists Xavier's help to ensure the wedding still goes ahead. Xavier gets the hospital gardens ready and organises the ceremony there. Jason's colleagues Dominic Copeland (David Ames) and Lofty Chiltern (Lee Mead) also join the celebrations for a double ceremony. Harper branded it a \\"joyous episode celebrating love and commitment in all their diverse forms.\\" Greta is later hit by a car and is taken to AAU with a broken leg. Greta required urgent surgery that only Serena could perform due to staff absences. Serena takes on the risky operation despite it being unethical. Serena is successful and saves Greta's leg. On his first day back to work following Greta's accident, Jason is unable to cope. Serena suggests he put on earphones to keep him calm. When consultant Ange Godard (Dawn Steele) notices this she is rude to him not realising he has Asperger syndrome. Reception The British charity National Autistic Society shortlisted Holby City in the drama category at the 2017 Autism Uncut media awards because of Jason's portrayal. Access All Areas branded Jason \\"a wonderfully funny young man with Aspergers.\\" Alan Shaw from The Sunday Post said that Robertson provides a \\"unique insight into what makes Jason Haynes such a special character, as he himself is a young man with Asperger‚Äôs.\\" Robertson himself has stated that Jason is an important role because he helped people understand more about autism. A writer from Ambitious about Autism stated \\"it is brilliant to see the character of Jason, who has autism, played by someone with autism. No one person with autism is the same, but they are brilliantly placed to bring this role to life and increase the awareness and understanding of autism.\\" Rachael Sigee from the Evening Standard believed it was of the utmost importance that an autistic actor played the role. She stated that \\"it feels like an important moment for disability representation in the UK to have a recurring character with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) on a mainstream soap.\\" Rieden of The Australian Women's Weekly branded Jason a \\"breakthrough role\\" and said it was a television first for a drama hiring an autistic actor to play an autistic character. Shanique Joseph from the Daily Express thought that Jason and Greta had a chaotic relationship. In March 2017, the BBC included Robertson in their list of two hundred future stars, which included fifty actors. Sue Haasler writing for Metro described Jason's nuptials as a \\"festive, if very cold, wedding\\" and said the episode was \\"beautiful\\" with happiness, sadness and a \\"wonderful script\\" by writer Ed Sellek.

The Drakensberg Group lies over most of Lesotho and localities in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Free State provinces of South Africa. It forms part of the greater Karoo Igneous Province, which occurs over an extensive area of southern AfricaErlank, A.J. ed., 1984. Petrogenesis of the Volcanic Rocks of the Karoo Province: National Geodynamics Programme Sponsored by the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.

Steep, fluted Drakensberg basalt (not dolerite) with typical uniform, vertical crack-lines, deposited on cave sandstone of the Clarens formation along the western limit of Platberg, Harrismith, Free State Background Diagram detailing how a large igneous province is formed The Drakensberg Group was formed approximately 182 million years ago during the early Jurassic period. Rifting tectonics in response to the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana are believed to have been the cause for the formation of the Drakensberg Group. Networks of hyperbyssal (shallow intrusives) dikes and sills represent the conduits through the crust that brought basaltic and andesitic lava to the surface, and caused the formation of the extrusive flood basalts of the Drakensberg Group. The dikes and sills are preserved throughout the Karoo Basin, and have served as a weathering barrier for much of the Karoo Supergroup rocks. The Drakensberg Group comprises minor sedimentary (ie. sandstones, lapilli deposits, pyroclastic deposits, and igneous (ie. continental flood basalt/andesite sequences, shallow intrusive dikes and sills, and diatremes) and is part of the greater volcanic extrusive rock sequences of the Karoo Igneous ProvinceEales, H.V., Marsh, J.S. and Cox, K.G., 1984. The Karoo igneous province: an introduction. In Petrogenesis of the volcanic rocks of the Karoo Province (Vol. 13, pp. 1-26). Geological Society of South Africa Special Publication 13.. In its entirety, the Karoo Igneous Province represents a vast suite of sedimentary, extrusive and intrusive rocks ranging from 200 - 130 million years in age. Past studies have shown that there are major geochemical changes in the provinces from the north and the south. The provinces of the central to southern areas are composed of Titanium - Zirconium low (Ti-Zr) tholeiitic basalt, and andesitic compositions also occurMarsh, J.S. and Eales, H.V., 1984. The chemistry and petrogenesis of igneous rocks of the Karoo central area, southern Africa. Spec Publ Geol Soc S Afr, 13, pp.27-67.. The Drakensberg Group has been subdivided into two recognized geological formations. While both formations are composed of tholeiitic basalt, they have minor geochemical differences. The two formations are listed below (from oldest to youngest): *Barkly East Formation: This formation is the only formation of the Drakensberg Group to contain sedimentary units. These sedimentary units are composed of sandstones, lapilli deposits, and pyroclastic deposits. They are only found in the lower sections and are interbedded with basalts. *Lesotho Formation: Composed entirely of tholeiitic basalts. However, in some parts of Lesotho pillow lava basalts are found which means these basalts had extruded out as lava underwater (subaqueous extrusion) into large lakes.  Geographic extent  The Drakensberg Group lavas compose the upper levels of the entire Drakensberg mountain range. The lavas stretch out over most of Lesotho and into the northeastern Eastern Cape, the southern Free State, and eastern KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa. Basalt provinces of the same low Ti-Zr chemical composition as the Drakensberg lavas are found in the Springbok Flats province in Limpopo, and other basalt sub-outcrops are found in eastern Botswana and central Namibia. These occurrences suggest that the Drakensberg Group lavas once covered a vast area over southern Africa. In addition, basalt xenoliths of the same chemical structure as the Drakensberg lavas have been found in the Northern Cape within Cretaceous-aged kimberlite pipes (~ 90 Ma) that intruded older rocks of the Karoo Supergroup. In the Lesotho highlands and the highest sections of the Drakensberg mountain range, only erosional remnants of the Drakensberg lavas remain. Correlation The Drakensberg Group is part of the greater Mesozoic-aged Karoo Igneous Province of southern Africa and the Ferrar Large Igneous Province of Antarctica (Karoo-Ferrar). The Kirwan basalts of Antarctica particularly resemble the Drakensberg Group, because Antarctica was close to the southern Lebombo province before the break up of Gondwana. The Drakensberg basalts are geochemically identical to the Springbok Flats volcanics. It was thought for some time that the Drakensberg volcanics were associated with the Parana Igneous Province of Brazil and the Etendeka Province in northern Namibia. However, these provinces have since been dated some 50 million years younger than the Karoo-Ferrar provinces.

It has been noted for protecting Kim Han-sol, the son of Kim Jong-nam, since the assassination of his father. It is also known to support North Korean defectors who want to leave North Korea. On March 1, 2019, \\"Cheollima Civil Defense\\" was renamed to \\"Free Joseon\\", which is also its proposed name for North Korea if it overthrows its current government. Activities On March 1, 2019, Free Joseon issued the \\"Declaration for a Free Joseon\\". Within this declaration, Free Joseon enumerated nine accusations against the Kim regime in North Korea. These ranged from accusations of torture and terrorism to failures to provide food for the people of North Korea. By virtue of these accusations, Free Joseon declared the Kim regime an illegitimate government and proclaimed itself to be the true representative government of the people of North Korea: \\"We declare on this day the establishment of Free Joseon, a provisional government preparing the foundations for a future nation built upon respect for principles of human rights and humanitarianism, holding sacred a manifest dignity for every woman, man, and child. We declare this entity the sole legitimate representative of the Korean people of the north.\\" The declaration continues on by calling upon resistance to the Kim regime of those who currently live under its rule and for Koreans abroad to lend their support to Free Joseon.https://www.cheollimacivildefense.org/?page=5 On 15 March 2019, The Washington Post reported that Free Joseon was involved in the February 22 raid on North Korea's embassy in Madrid.

The group's activities have been linked to foreign intelligence services by analyst Andrei Lankov, who suspected it of being a \\"front\\" for the CIA.

The statement was critical of the true intent of the North Korean regime in reopening dialogue with the United States on the issue of denuclearisation, stating \\"Millions starved to death, hundreds of thousands of citizens in concentration camps, and hundreds of foreigners kidnapped and assassinated will attest that, unfortunately, the regime in Pyongyang has never acted in good faith and only seeks to stall while it continues to proliferate weapons of mass destruction and commit mass atrocities.

It's the largest pizza chain in Russia and one of Europe's fastest-growing restaurant chains. Ovchinnikov states that the company views itself as an IT-driven retail company based on the principle of transparency.

In 2014, the company ran the largest crowdfunding initiative in Russia to date, raising over $2 million from 180 private investors. Dodo also made headlines from Washington to Tokyo with what it billed as the world's first commercial delivery of pizzas by drone, to customers in the central square in Syktyvkar. In September 2018, Fyodor Ovchinnikov announced that the chain would grow its IT team from 60 to 250 developers in two years, and by October 2019, Dodo Pizza has doubled it.

It was composed in 2001 by request of the Boston Symphony Orchestra for Anne-Sophie Mutter. Previn conducted the first performance in March 2002 in Boston. The same performers recorded the work in 2003, and received a Grammy Award for it in 2005.  History  Previn composed the violin concerto in 2001 on a commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He wrote the solo part with violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter in mind. Previn called it \\"Anne-Sophie\\" in honour of the soloist who was to become his wife, and it has been described as a musical \\"love letter\\" and an \\"engagement present\\". The world premiere was on 14 March 2002, conducted by the composer. The couple married in August that year. They made a recording released in 2003, and toured Europe with the Oslo Philharmonic, including a concert of The Proms at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 August 2004. They divorced in 2006.  Structure and music  The concerto is in three movements: # Moderato # Cadenza ‚Äì Slowly # Andante (\\"from a train in Germany\\") Unusually, the movements increase in length. A typical performance lasts forty minutes. A reviewer for Gramophone noted that the first movement showed, like Korngold's Violin Concerto which Mutter and Previn had performed together, \\"sweetly nostalgic cinemascope romanticism\\". The contrasting second movement is desolate in character, described by Previn as \\"more barren and acidulous\\" than the outer movements. The third movement, subtitled \\"from a train in Germany\\", includes the composer's memories of a train ride when he was a boy living in Germany, including variations of the children's song \\"Wenn ich ein V√∂glein w√§r\\". A reviewer noted the movement's humour and \\"ecstatic melodic flights\\", ending \\"darkly beautiful\\". The composer used orchestral colours, but consistently serving the soloist.  Recording  The Concerto was recorded by the performers of the premiere, released by Deutsche Grammophon in 2003, coupled with Leonard Bernstein's 1954 Serenade after Plato's \\"Symposium\\" for solo violin, string orchestra, harp and percussion, with Mutter and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. A reviewer compared the first movements to concertos by Korngold and Prokofiev. Mutter's playing has been described as dancing \\"through the thorniest passages\\" and giving \\"a silky sheen to even the most stratospherically placed notes\\", while the orchestra plays \\"with an ideal mixture of sumptuousness and delicacy\\".  Legacy  Previn's violin concerto was one of the composer's most successful works. The recording received the Grammy Award in the category \\"instrumental soloist performance with orchestra\\" in 2004. Shortly before Previn's death in February 2019, Mutter had embarked on a recital tour of the United States, including the concerto in her performance.

Description The shrub or tree has an erect to bushy habit and typically grows to a height of and has lightly fissured brown bark. It has narrowly elliptic to oblanceolate shaped reddish to grey-green leathery phyllodes that have a length of and a width of . The juvenile foliage is pinnate and can persist on older plants. It blooms between July and November producing inflorescences with pale to bright yellow flowers. The simple inflorescences are found in groups of 5 to 29 in an axillary racemes with an axis that is in length. The spherical flower-heads have a diameter of and contain 9 to 15 pale to bright yellow coloured flowers. Following flowering firmly papery to thin leathery, glabrous seed pods form that are straight and flat with a length of and are wide and are often covered in a powdery white coating. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Allan Cunningham in 1825 in the work On the Botany of the Blue Mountains. Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales. The only synonym is Racosperma rubidum. It is also often confused with Acacia amoena Distribution It is found in southwestern parts of Queensland, western New South Wales and Victoria on the tablelands of the Great Dividing Range. It is often a part of open woodland or dry sclerophyll forest communities and grows on rocky hilltops and slopes in rocky soils an in alluvial soils along rivers and creeks. The bulk of the population is found between the Black Range in northeast Victoria in the south up to near Stanthorpe in south-eastern Queensland. Cultivation The shrub is sold commercially in tubestock or in seed form. It is noted as a good pioneer species being fast growing, hardy, cold tolerant and beneficial as a nitrogen fixing plant. It can grow nutrient poor, shallow, skeletal, high altitude soils and plays a valuable role in catchment protection within its native range. It prefers a sunny position, requires little maintenance, is drought tolerant and can tolerate temporary inundations.

It was bestowed upon Sikhs, and was awarded for faithful service or acts of public welfare. The title was used after any military rank, but before the title holder's name. From 1911 holders of the title were also awarded a special Title Badge. Members of the first class of the Order of British India could also use the title of Sardar Bahadur, with members of the second class using Bahadur. The title of Sardar Bahadur was part of a wider honours system put in place by British India: First Class *Dewan Bahadur, for Hindus; *Nawab Bahadur, for Muslims; *Sardar Bahadur, for Sikhs; Second Class *Khan Bahadur, for Muslims; *Rai Bahadur, (North India) or Rao Bahadur (South India), for Hindus; Third Class *Khan Sahib, for Muslims; *Rai Sahib, (North India) or Rao Sahib (South India), for Hindus. Those of other religions received the title considered most appropriate, for example native Indian Christians with a Hindu sounding name would receive a Hindu title. In most cases a recipient proceeded from the lowest grade to a higher level, with only the most senior title used.

Hames (; born 8 July 1966) is a professor of history at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), in Beer-Sheva, Israel, and the incumbent of the David Berg and Family Chair in European History. On August 1, 2018, he assumed office as Rector of BGU. Hames' research focuses on medieval history, with a particular interest in inter-religious encounters, particularly between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. He also works on religious conversion, inter-religious polemics, mysticism, philosophy, apocalypticism, and magic.  Early life and education  Chaim Hames was born in England in 1966 and immigrated with his parents to Israel in 1978 when he was 12. He grew up in a Religious Orthodox-Zionist household in Petah-Tikva and attended Midrashiat Noam, a Yeshiva High-School in Pardes Hanna. Following three years of military service, Hames completed a B.A. in history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Hames received an M.Phil (Queens‚Äô College) in 1992 and Ph.D (Sidney Sussex College) in Medieval History from the University of Cambridge in England in 1996 where his supervisor was Professor David Abulafia (Gonville and Caius College).

The band comprises four Austrian instrumentalists, English vocalist and artist Alex CF, and German vocalist Anna. They have produced a trilogy of concept albums‚ÄîArchivist (2015), Construct (2017), and Triumvirate (2019)‚Äîwhich follows an epic science fiction narrative created by Alex. The eponymous Archivist is \\"the unwitting survivor of a massive ecological disaster. The last human alive, yet in relative safety aboard the only remaining ark jettisoned from a dying Earth, she begins to record her memories of the world left in turmoil by humanity's shortsightedness and greed.\\" She shares the spaceship with an artificial intelligence, Construct; together they are the sole survivors of total destruction between humans and machines.  History  Guitarists Gerfried and Matthias had played together in the hardcore punk band Plague Mass. From 2011 to 2014, Gerfried lived in London and played with Alex CF in the hardcore band Carnist and the post-metal band Light Bearer. Alex is a writer and artist who creates mythological stories and visual art with often environmental themes. He has fronted a number of \\"concept bands\\", including Fall of Efrafa (2005‚Äì2009), Momentum (2011‚Äì2013), and Light Bearer (2010‚Äì2014). Since 2014, he performs with Archivist, Anopheli (alongside Anna), and Morrow (alongside Gerfried), all of them conceptually related. Upon returning from London to Austria, Gerfried formed a new band with Matthias, recruiting Steff (whom they knew from his screamo band Dimirij) as a drummer. They initially wanted a German-speaking vocalist, but Alex pitched them the Archivist narrative, which he had created long before and thought a good fit to their \\"ethereal driving\\" sound with \\"broad and operatic\\" melodies. He then brought on Anna (formerly of German post-metal band Amber) as a second voice. Archivist's self-titled debut album was released on 4 June 2015. It was recorded and mixed by Nickl Gruber and mastered by Oskar Karlsson. On 23 February 2017, the band followed up with Construct, which was recorded and mixed by Gruber in Graz and mastered by Cristian Varga. Physical releases have been handled by Alerta Antifascista and in the US by Halo of Flies. A final album, Triumvirate, was released in April 2019.  Artistry   Concept  Stanley Kubrick's 1968 epic science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey influenced the band's artistry. In a 2017 interview, Alex explained: > The basic premise is one of human hubris, trying to control our technology, > which backfires when it claims personhood. This ends in mutual annihilation, > except for a stowaway on a ship ‚Äì the Archivist, and an AI built into the > ship ‚Äì Construct. Both are the lone survivors of their respective species, > and in the wake of their peoples destruction they must find some kind of > purpose, and yet they are unable to, set adrift in the endless expanse of > space. The AI wishes to find the source of its creator and delves into some > theological and philosophical digressions, whilst the Archivist is put in > stasis for 2000 years. It is both a story of duality ‚Äì how they both find > purpose in one another, but also one of machine Gods, existential crisis, > religion and belief. Archivist shares a fictional universe with Alex and Gerfried's crust punk band Morrow, \\"playing out from different millennia. They are entirely separate bands, but they are linked by ancestors and descendants of the Archivist.\\" In a 2018 interview, Alex elaborated that \\"Morrow and Archivist exist at opposite ends of a story and will finish when they meet in the middle, on [Triumvirate]. Morrow has other stories to tell after this, what we do with Archivist is unknown at this stage.\\" He also stated: > My role in compositions is usually colours and moods, which the lyrics > convey, I will describe the story to the other band members and to some > extent the rhythms and tempos reflect that. I think the music I have been a > part of always has a similar feel to it, mainly due to shared members and > interests and often this singular goal. ... I have never set out for music > to be anything more than exercising ideas, and to tell stories.  Style and influences  In a review of Construct, Matt Butler of Echoes and Dust described its sound as \\"atmospheric post-metal\\" with dystopian themes, characterized by \\"squalls of blackened guitar, post-hardcore barks and blast beats\\" but also \\"stunning shimmers of major-key riffage [and] ... clean vocals [that] break through the storm\\". Like Butler, Andy Synn of No Clean Singing suggested that Construct's coherence suffered from the sheer scope of the concept, but both praised the band's ability to \\"seamlessly transition between breathy, ethereal ambience and searing metallic catharsis\\" as well as the overall power of the album. Butler likened it to Oathbreaker, Astronoid, Amenra, and Cult of Luna, while Synn noted similarities to Alcest and Anathema. In 2017, Gerfried cited Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey as a major influence on Archivist. Musically the band is eclectic, with backgrounds ranging \\"from indie to hardcore/punk to metal\\"; Gerfried mentioned the Smiths as a personal favorite while Alex mentioned Neurosis.

Acceptability and grammaticality The goal of acceptability rating studies is to gather insights into the mental grammars of participants. As the grammaticality of a linguistic construction is an abstract construct that cannot be accessed directly, this type of tasks is usually not called grammaticality, but acceptability judgment. This can be compared to intelligence. Intelligence is an abstract construct that cannot be measured directly. What can be measured are the outcomes of specific test items. The result of one item, however, is not very telling. Instead, IQ tests consist of several items building a score. Similarly, in acceptability rating studies, grammatical constructions are measured through several items, i.e., sentences to be rated. This is also done to ensure that participants do not rate the meaning of a particular sentence. The difference between acceptability and grammaticality is linked to the distinction between performance and competence in generative grammar. Types Several different types of acceptability rating tasks are used in linguistics. The most common tasks use Likert scales. Forced choice and yes-no rating tasks are also common. Besides these classical test types, there are other, methods like thermometer judgments or magnitude estimation which have been argued to be more difficult to process for participants, however.Weskott, T. & Fanselow, G.

Reviewer Warren Blumenfeld saw the book as praising older American social justice movements that challenged hierarchies based on race and gender and attempted to remedy societal inequities associated with prejudices toward certain ethnic groups and the economic displacements of the industrial revolution, while failing to acknowledge the extent to which contemporary America \\"privileges and subordinates individuals based primarily on their social identities.\\" Jonah Goldberg called Unjust \\"crisp, insightful and passionate\\". Alternatively the book was panned by several prominent Civil rights leaders including Tiffany Cross, co-founder and managing editor of The Beat DC, who in a Morning Joe appearance aside Rothman chimed in that his thesis was \\"myopic\\", going further stating, \\"Many people are not master of their own destiny....I think it‚Äôs an accurate philosophy. With respect, I think your outlook on this is a bit 'myopic' and based solely on your experience, and doesn‚Äôt extend the intellectual debate with people who haven‚Äôt had your history.‚Äù She did agree that many white people lived in poverty, but Cross argued their experience was still different from poor people of color ‚Äî and she said Rothman ignored those realities. ‚ÄúCertainly there are economically disadvantaged white people in this country,‚Äù Cross said. ‚ÄúI think the reasons why they‚Äôre socially and economically disadvantaged are very different from the reasons why some communities of color are disadvantaged, and think it‚Äôs really dangerous to look at the current state this country without looking at it through the context of historical systems that put those people in that position.‚Äù And ended by pointing out that ‚ÄúYou call that victimization, but I call that reality for a lot of people.\\"https://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/2019/01/diversity-expert- destroys-msnbc-conservative-complaining-about-negative-discrimination-against- white-men/ References  External links  Unjust: Social Justice and the Unmaking of America Book interview, Reason podcast *Noah Rothman On The Convoluted Ideology Of Social Justice, February 6, 2019 interview Madeline Osburn; The Federalist * Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American male writers Category:American columnists Category:American political commentators Category:American political writers Category:Jewish American writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Living people Category:1981 births ","title":"Noah Rothman"},{"id":"60106108","text":"Nartey Polo Amanor (born April 10, 1995) is a Ghanaian footballer who plays for AS Ot√¥ho as a Defender.

She was also a teacher of Ryu Gwansun, who organized the March 1st Movement against Japanese rule.  Early life  Kim Ransa was born in 1872 in Pyongyang. Despite the school policy that banned the admission of married women, she successfully persuaded the educators of Ehwa Hakdang and became a student in 1896 at the age of 24. Later on, she studied at Ohio Wesleyan University becoming the first Korean woman to study abroad and earn a bachelor's degree.  Teaching career  After her graduation, Kim returned from the United States and started teaching English and Bible in Ewha Hakdang. She then became an advisor for a student-led organization called Ewha Literary Society (E-mun-hai) which played a pivotal role for Yu Gwan-sun to lead a peaceful demonstration with other women students. Kim encouraged Yu Gwan-sun to become \\"a light for Korea,\\" and join the organization. Kim then became the only Korean professor to join the establishment of the first women's college at Ewha Haktang in 1910 and eventually served as the vice principal.  Independence advocacy  With the trust of Gojong, the last king of Joseon and the first Emperor of Korea, Kim played an essential role as a translator and an emissary in the Korean independence movement. In 1919, Gojong and Kim made plans to send delegates (including Kim) to the Paris Peace Conference seeking for foreign support for Korean independence, but the attempt stopped after the sudden death of Gojong on January 21, 1919.  Death  In 1919, Kim traveled to Beijing in order to attend the Paris Peace Conference. After having a meal with Korean residents in Beijing, she fell ill and eventually died at the age of 47. There were witnesses that Kim's corpse turned black (potentially due to poisoning), but the official cause of death was not determined.  Legacy  Kim is known for her advocacy for women empowerment through education. In response to a piece written by Yun Chi-ho, for example, on a journal The Korea Mission Field in July 1911 critiquing Korean women need to learn how to do household chores, Kim published a rebuttal piece in 4 months asserting that \\"the purpose of education for women is not to cook or sew better,\\" and that \\"women students should not be blamed, with a lack of evidence, for not knowing how to do laundry nor ironing. In 1995, Kim was posthumously awarded with the Order of Merit for National Foundation.

He was also a relation of Dona Catherina, Queen of Kandy and the guardian of her children.  History   First revolt, (1603)  Antonio Barreto as he was known, was a Sinhalese Catholic Karava soldier from the kingdom of Kotte, who had initially fought on the side of the Portuguese Empire as a Lascarin commander. Barreto lead a rebellion against the Governor of Portuguese Ceylon, Jer√≥nimo de Azevedo, in 1603 after his comrade Vimaladharmasuriya I seized power in the Kingdom of Kandy. Barreto forced the Portuguese forts in the Kuruwita region to capitulate. Antonio Barreto fought on the side of Kandy kingdom where he gained high office under Vimaladharmasuriya I under the name Kuruvita Rala and was rewarded with the title \\"Prince of Uva\\".  Second revolt, (1616‚Äì1619)  Vimaladharmasuriya I who died in 1603 was succeeded by his cousin Senarat of Kandy by marrying the king's queen, Dona Catherina. Writing in the mid 17th century, Philippus Baldaeus states that with the demise of the heir to the throne under suspicious circumstances and the illness of Senarat, Kuruvita Rala was tasked with administering the kingdom. In December 1616, he led the Kandyan army and seized the Portuguese fort at Sabaragamuwa. In contrast to Kuruvita Rala who fought most of his battles on land, was his nephew the admiral of Senerats naval fleets, fighting the enemies on the sea such as the Kandyan Naval Raid (1612-13) and met with great success. Nikapitiye, one pretending to be the grandson of Rajasinha I of Sitawaka, had after his victory against a Portuguese battle asked Senerat for the hand of one of the daughters of the Kandy Queen. Kuruvita Rala enraged by Senerat marrying the daughters, refusing Nikapitiye's request and persisting on peace with the Portuguese, raided the Kandy Kingdom and rebelled against Senerat in 1617, driving him out of the capital. Kuruvita Rala seiged the stronghold on much of the country including Batticaloa, Wellawaya, Negombo, parts of Sabaragamuwa, Matara and southern half of Kandy Kingdom. He thereupon invited Mayadunne of Denawaka residing in India, one of the Sitawaka line, to be crowned as the king of Sri Lanka.  Defeat, (1620)  The general Constantino de S√° de Noronha led a strong Portuguese force, forcing Kuruvita Rala to retire to Uva. In June 1620, de Sa led a campaign against Mayadunne and expelled him from Portuguese territory and he fled to India. A month later, Kuruvita Rala who chose to remain in the country, was captured and killed by the Dissava, Don Constantino of Matara, marking the end of the Portuguese opposition in the low lands.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch on February 28, 2019.  Gameplay  Ape Out is a single player beat 'em up video game played from a top-down perspective. The player controls a gorilla running through a maze while evading enemies in the form of gun- wielding humans. The human enemies are easily killed with a single attack and can also be grabbed and used as a shield; however, as they are armed with guns, they can quickly kill the player as well. The principal aim of the game is to escape each level and killing enemies is not technically required in order to proceed. The maze design is randomized and is slightly different on each play, making it impossible to memorize the layout of a level. One of the game's main themes is jazz music and each of the game's four chapters are represented as jazz albums with each level representing one track. The gameplay features a loud and chaotic, all-percussion jazz soundtrack composed by Matt Boch (associate arts professor at NYU Game Center) which reacts dynamically to the gameplay, for example by increasing in intensity as the player faces more enemies, crashing cymbals each time an enemy is killed and adjusting the volume according to one's speed and number of kills. In order to provide a reactive and procedurally generated soundtrack for each playthrough, the game draws from a bank of thousands of recorded individual drum sounds, some recorded by Boch with others sourced externally, and combines them according to player movement. The system will also match the location of what is happening on screen to the drum or cymbal which matches that approximate location on a real drum kit. Each chapter of the game also features a different style of jazz percussion, with Boch describing the first chapter as the most quintessentially jazz, whereas other chapters feature more unusual instruments for jazz music. The game also features a minimalist art style which has been compared to that of Saul Bass.  Development  Ape Out was developed by Gabe Cuzzillo using the Unity game engine. Ape Out was Cuzzillo's second game, after Foiled, which he developed with Aaron Taecker-Wyss and released in 2014. Development on Ape Out began when Cuzzillo entered into game development courses at New York University (NYU), where he also worked on an independent study with Bennett Foddy. Foddy contributed to Ape Out art, while Matt Boch, an associate professor for NYU's Game Center, worked on the game's music system and sound design. Ape Out was part of the NYU Game Center Incubator and partially financed by Indie Fund. In 2016, Ape Out was a finalist for the Independent Games Festival's \\"Best Student Game\\" award, losing it to Beglitched. Publisher Devolver Digital announced their involvement in Ape Out in March 2017, when they released a playable trailer for the game and announced a projected release date of \\"summer 2017\\". The publisher announced in December 2018 that Ape Out would be released on February 7, 2019, for Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch. However, the game was delayed by three weeks and was released for both platforms on February 28, 2019.  Reception  Ape Out received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews on both platforms, according to review aggregator website Metacritic.  Awards  The game was nominated for \\"Best Visual Design\\" and \\"Best Audio\\" at the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards, and for the Off Broadway Award for Best Indie Game at the New York Game Awards, and won the award for \\"Audio Achievement\\" at the 16th British Academy Games Awards, whereas its other nomination was for \\"Debut Game\\".

Mac Randall of JazzTimes wrote \\"An oceangoing organism with one brain and eight independent neuron-bearing limbs is the perfect image to invoke for a rather intense collection of piano duets\\". Alison Bentley of London Jazz News stated \\"Kris Davis and Craig Taborn on this new album of piano duets sound as if they‚Äôre playing with at least eight arms and probably a few legs too, such is the virtuosity and intensity of their playing. The six tracks on this intriguing CD are drawn from three live gigs, melding free jazz, blues and modern classical music\\". Doug Simpson of Audiophile Audition added \\"The performances, which run in length from seven minutes to nearly 15 minutes, incorporate pre-composed material; wholly improvised sections; and two carefully chosen cover tunes. Taborn and Davis‚Äô conversant style is parallel to the free jazz of likeminded pianists such as Cecil Taylor, Don Pullen or Paul Bley\\". In his review for Financial Times, Mike Hobart commented, \\"There are times when the criss-crossing lines and rumbling full-piano chords captured on this dazzling live piano duet do indeed conjure a single creature with many arms. Even when playing at full stretch, pianists Kris Davis and Craig Taborn deliver the control and sense of purpose of a single intelligence.\\" Rolling Stone included the release in its 20 Best Jazz Albums of 2018 list, ranking it #18.

The sequence of time tag must be non- decreasing, which intuitively means that letters are received. For example, a system receiving a word over a network may associate to each letter the time at which the letter is received. The non-decreasing condition here means that the letters are received in the correct order. A timed language is a set of timed words.  Example  Consider an elevator. What is formally called a letter is could be in fact an information such that \\"someone press the button on the 2nd floor\\", or \\"the doors opened on the third floor\\". In this case, a timed word is a sequence of actions taken by the elevators and its users, with time stamps to recall those actions. The timed word can then be analyzed by formal method to check whether a property such that \\"each time the elevator is called, it arrives in less than three minutes assuming that no one held the door for more than fifteen seconds\\" holds. A statement such as this one is usually expressed in metric temporal logic, an extension of linear temporal logic which allow to express time constraints. A timed-word may be passed to a model, such as a timed automaton, which will decide, given the letters or actions which already occurred, what is the next action which should be done. In our example, to which floor the elevator must go. Then a program may test this timed automaton and check the above mentioned property. That is, it will try to generate a timed-word in which the door is never held open for more than fifteen seconds, and in which a user must wait more than three minutes after calling the elevator.  Definition  Given an alphabet A, a timed word is a sequence, finite or infinite w=(a_0,t_0)(a_1,t_1)\\\\dots with a_i\\\\in A, t_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb R_+ with t_i\\\\le t_{i+1} for each integer i. If the sequence is infinite but the sequence of (t_0)(t_1)\\\\dots is bounded, then this word is said to be a Zeno timed word, in reference to the Zeno's paradoxes where an infinite number of action occurs in a finite time. Untimed w is the word w without its time stamps, i.e. it is a_0a_1\\\\dots. Given a timed language L, Untimed L is then the set of untimed w for w\\\\in L.

He travelled around the world on numerous expeditions including the Field Museum-Chicago Daily News Abyssinian, Kelley-Roosevelts Asiatic, and Vernay-Cutting Expeditions. He was among the first Europeans to enter the forbidden city of Lhasa in Tibet and is credited with introducing the Lhasa Apso breed into the United States. Early life Cutting was born in New York City on January 17, 1889. He was the son of Robert Fulton Cutting, known as the \\"first citizen of New York,\\" and Helen (n√©e Suydam) Cutting, who married in 1883. From his father's first marriage, he had an older half-brother, Robert Bayard Cutting, who died in Paris during World War I. Among his full siblings was Helen Suydam Cutting, who married Lucius Kellogg Wilmerding Jr.; Elisabeth McEvers Cutting; Robert Fulton Cutting Jr.; Ruth Hunter Cutting; and Schermerhorn Cutting, who died young. Among his many prominent family members was his maternal uncle, Walter Lispenard Suydam, and his paternal uncle, William Bayard Cutting. His mother was a granddaughter of Abraham Schermerhorn and a niece of Caroline Schermerhorn, who was married to William Backhouse Astor Jr. Cutting went to the Groton School and Harvard University, where he graduated in 1912 with an engineering major. Career After Harvard, he went into engineering sales with the M. W. Kellogg company. He served in the US Army during both world wars, with the rank of Lieutenant colonel in World War II. Prior to the U.S. joining World War II, he was a prominent advocate of arming Britain via The American Committee for the Defense of British Homes. Cutting was a member of The Room, a group of high-society amateur spies organized by Vincent Astor who reported to President Franklin Roosevelt. Exploration Expedition members, left to right, C. Suydam Cutting, Jack Baum, Wilfred Hudson Osgood, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, Alfred Marshall Bailey, 1927. In 1925, he went on his first expedition to Chinese Turkestan with Kermit and Theodore Roosevelt Jr. After the Roosevelt expedition, he traveled to Ethiopia in 1926, Assam in 1927, Tibet in 1928, 1930, 1935, 1937, the Galapagos Islands in 1930 (sailing aboard Vincent Astor's yacht Nourmahal), Celebes in 1934, Nepal in 1937, and Upper Burma in 1939. In 1935, he went to the forbidden city of Lhasa in Tibet that made him famous as being among the early Westerners to see the city. He was able to gain admittance by currying favor with the Dalai Lama through a series of gifts over a number of years, including a pair of dachshunds, a pair of dalmatians, gold watches and heating appliances. The Dalai Lama also wanted an ostrich, but it was felt that the animal wouldn't have survived the journey. Eventually, the Dalai Lama permitted Cutting and Arthur Stannard Vernay to enter Lhasa and gave Cutting the first Lhasa Apso dogs that entered the U.S. in 1933. After his expedition to Lhasa, Cutting wrote a book that was published commercially about his travels over the course of fifteen years, entitled The Fire Ox and Other Years. He also wrote a number of articles for the Museum of Natural History in the 1930s, including articles about his expedition and articles about hunting with a Maharajah's specially trained cheetahs (which was collected in As Told at the As Told at the Explorer‚Äôs Club: More than Fifty Tales of Adventure edited by George Plimpton). Cutting is credited with helping to save the Galapagos tortoise from extinction and with bringing the first Lhasa Apso dogs to the United States. Personal life In 1932, Cutting was married to Helen McMahon (1894‚Äì1961), who joined him on his second expedition to Tibet in 1937. Helen was a widow of James Cox Brady Sr. (a son of Anthony N. Brady, the largest shareholder of the American Tobacco Company), who died in 1924. After her death in 1961, he remarried to Mary Percy (n√©e Pyne) Filley (1893‚Äì1994) in 1963. Mary, a widow of Oliver Dwight Filley (the grandson of Oliver Filley), was the daughter of Percy Rivington Pyne and Maud (n√©e Howland) Pyne. They had a 35-acre estate known as \\"Old Fort Bay\\", purchased by Cutting's first wife and her first husband, near Lyford Cay (located on the western tip of New Providence Island in The Bahamas), where the entertained friends, including Gertrude Legendre. Cutting was a close friend of the Duke (formerly Edward VIII) and Duchess of Windsor, who he entertained at their Gladstone, New Jersey home, known as Hamilton Farms, inherited from his first wife. Mary owned her own estate, Upton Pyne. Cutting died at his summer home on Chappaquiddick Island in Edgartown, Massachusetts on Martha's Vineyard on August 24, 1972. He was buried at St. Bernard's cemetery in Bernardsville, New Jersey. His widow continued to live in Bernardsville, and then Far Hills, until her death in 1994. Honors Cutting was awarded a Croix de Guerre (with gold star) and an Order of the Black Star from the French. He was also made an honorary Commander, Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.

ISTA is a modern mystery school, intended to guide participants towards a holistic and empowered lifestyle. ISTA was founded in 2007 by Baba Dez Nichols as an international non-profit educational organization. Baba Dez Nichols stars in the award-winning documentary Sex Magic. Initially, ISTA had a central office and manager, but trainings are now worldwide, and there is no longer an operational location. Instead, a \\"Governance Circle\\" of trainers oversees the organization. Nichols remains involved in the trainings, but stepped-down from his participation in the Governance Circle in 2019. Tantra and shamanism influence its teachings. Nudity and other practices believed to occur at ISTA have caused controversy around ISTA trainings at some locations. Many thousands of individuals have taken the ISTA trainings all over the world. In Israel, a large community of ISTA graduates have developed and created other programs that are carrying the ISTA teachings to a larger audience. Training levels ISTA holds four main programs: *Level 1 (SSSEx, Spriritual Sexual Shamanic Experience) is a week- long experience for the integration of spirituality and sexuality. *Level 2 (SSSIn, Spriritual Sexual Shamanic Initiation) is a deeper initiation journey, working more with shadow aspects and the transpersonal self. *Level 3 (SSSeed, Spriritual Sexual Shamanic Seeding) is designed to train people who want to work in the field of sexual shamanism either within ISTA or autonomously. *The Practitioner Training is a structured program for developing practitioners to offer this work one on one. Physical temple In the thousands of ISTA trainings given worldwide, ISTA creates temporary temple spaces. But ISTA has a permanent physical temple located in New Zealand near Palmerston North. Formerly Highden Manor Estate, ISTA activist Bruce Lyon converted the hotel into Highden Temple (an ISTA temple).

Her books are noted for their interest in international development, poverty, human rights and \\"ex-pat experiences\\". Before the publication of her first book, Innan Floden Tar Oss (Before the River Takes Us) in 2012, Thorfinn worked in international development. This followed a career as a journalist in national print and broadcast media in Sweden. She has also produced documentaries for national TV. Innan Floden has been translated into Polish, Norwegian, Icelandic and English.  Biography  Thorfinn started work as a journalist in her home town Lund before moving to Stockholm to join the national daily Svenska dagbladet as one of its youngest reporters. She was later headhunted to work on the flagship investigative reporting programme, Kalla Fakta, on the newly started television channel, TV4. In 1992, Thorfinn moved to London, UK, reporting for, among others, Swedish Broadcasting. On return to Sweden, she continued to work as a journalist before completing a master's degree in international development at Uppsala University. In 2000, Thorfinn started to work for the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency as a gender advisor. Between 2005 and 2008, she was based at the Swedish Embassy in Dhaka, Bangladesh, as an analyst/first secretary, \\\\- where she initiated a qualitative results framework called \\"Reality Checks\\". It won acclaim among development partners. The time in Bangladesh inspired her to write her first novel, which is set in the fascinating but peculiar world of international ex-patriates in a country struggling to deal with extreme poverty and the changes caused by rapid industrialization, urbanization and climate change. The book was written and published during her time at Lund University's Creative Writing Programme, LUFS, 2010‚Äì2012. It was widely discussed when published and Thorfinn appeared on numerous TV shows and conferences to discuss development aid. She was voted one of Sweden's most influential voices in human rights and development in 2013. In 2014, Thorfinn moved to Burma/Myanmar where she worked for various development partners, amongst them the Swedish Embassy, UNICEF and Save the Children. At the same time, she completed and published her second novel, Den som g√•r p√• tigerstigar, which also became a bestseller in Sweden. She also prepared the establishment of an NGO focused on \\"girl issues\\" called MeSheWe. MeSheWe is now formally established and working to support the rights of girls in Myanmar and Bangladesh.

From 1935 until 1978 the Hotel Californian was a temperance hotel. Attendees at the 1938 NEA Convention stayed at the hotel and held a luncheon there. Architecture The building's exterior was constructed in a Renaissance Revival architecture style while the lobby was designed with Spanish Colonial Revival architecture features. The addition by Jacobs finished in 1929 added Art Deco features to the building's exterior. The exterior includes pressed metal panels, balconies, and elaborate cornice decoration. It also features marble floors. Lobby of the Hotel Serrano in 2008 The lobby has columns with a twisting design and decorative ironwork.

The form is very important for government employees: any errors in the form can affect eligibility for certain benefits (such as when an employee can retire and with what level of annuity).https://retireinstitute.com/why-your-sf-50-is-important/ The Form The first four blocks on the SF 50 list the employee's name, Social Security Number, date of birth, and the effective date of the personnel action. The effective date (Block 4) is important for annuity purposes (as an employee nears retirement) as it is the beginning date used to calculate how long an employee has held a particular pay rate for \\"high-3\\" purposes under either of the retirement systems (FERS or CSRS). Blocks 5 and 6 (\\"First Action\\" and \\"Second Action\\") are subdivided into sub-blocks. Sub-blocks A and B are used to note the action being taken, while sub-blocks C/D (and E/F, where applicable) give the legal authority for the change being made. Blocks 7 through 22 are shown in a \\"from/to\\" format, whereby Blocks 7 through 14 list the employee's status before the SF 50 action, while Blocks 15 through 22 list the employee's status after the SF 50 action. These blocks list the employee's position title (7/15), pay plan (8/16), occupational code (9/17), grade (10/18), step (11/19), total salary (12/20), pay basis (13/21), and name and location of position's organization (14/22). Blocks 12/20 are further subdivided into sub-blocks A (basic pay), B (locality adjustment), C (adjusted basic pay, total of A and B), and D (other pay). This section is most frequently used to denote general pay increases, promotions or within-grade increases, changes in duty station, or any monetary awards. Blocks 23 through 33 list various employee data fields, which are important for various benefits and rights. These blocks list veteran's preference (23), tenure (24), \\"agency use\\" (25), veteran's preference for RIF (26; RIF stands for \\"reduction in force\\", or a layoff in private sector terms), the level of FEGLI insurance enrollment (27), whether the employee is a re-hired annuitant (28), pay rate determinant (29), the retirement plan (30; whether under CSRS or FERS and also whether under FICA or not), service computation date (31), work schedule (32), and if part time the number of hours per pay period (33). The Service Computation Date (Block 31) is not necessarily the date on which an employee began his/her civil service career: if an employee left civil service and then later returned, the date is adjusted to a date which would reflect no break in service. Blocks 34 through 39 list employee data fields pertaining to the position as of the effective date of the SF 50. These blocks list the type of position occupied (34), whether the position is or is not exempt from FLSA (35), the appropriation code (36), bargaining unit status (37), and the code and location of the employee's duty station (38 and 39). Finally blocks 40 through 50 list other miscellaneous information. Blocks 40 through 44 list various agency data fields, the remaining blocks list any remarks (45; for example a within-grade increase may state \\"work performance is at an acceptable level\\"), the employee's department, code and personnel office ID (46 through 48), and the approval date and signature of the SF 50 (49 and 50). Standard Form 52 Every SF 50 is generated by first creating an SF 52 (\\"Request for Personnel Action\\").

Behkish is an active member of the social justice groups Mothers and Families of Khavaran and Mothers of Laleh Park, two groups that raise awareness for politically motivated killings, detainments, and forcible disappearances in Iran. In February 2018, Behkish was sentenced to 7.5 years in jail for \\"propaganda against the state\\" and \\"collusion against the country\\". These were added to a previous 4.5 year sentence from 2011 for \\"assembling and conspiring with the intent to harm national security\\" and \\"propaganda against the system\\".  Activism  Behkish is an active and prominent member of the social justice groups Mothers of Khavaran and Mothers of Laleh Park (also known as Mourning Mothers).

On December 25, 2011 she received a 4.5 year sentence for \\"assembling and conspiring with the intent to harm national security\\" and \\"propaganda against the system\\". She wrote an open letter to President Hassan Rouhani, in August 2013, in which she described the persecution and legal prosecution she has experienced. On September 16, 2016, she was stopped at the Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran while boarding a flight to visit her daughter who lives in Ireland. During this incident, her passport was confiscated and she was summoned to appear in front of the Shahid Moghaddas Court at Tehran's Evin Prison.

This was added to the previous 4.5 year sentence. A coalition of 20 human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, published a statement accusing the Iranian government of oppressing individuals peacefully seeking truth and justice for the 1980s' executions; a statement that explicitly included Behkish. In another statement, Amnesty International claimed that Behkish's > \\"conviction stems solely from her peaceful activities to seek truth and > justice, including holding commemorative gatherings at her home; visiting > the families of victims; taking flowers to Khavaran (a deserted mass > gravesite in the south of Tehran), where two of her brothers are believed to > be buried in unmarked graves; and posting about Iran‚Äôs human rights > violations on Facebook and other online platforms\\".

The Wild Boys, his first feature film, was named the top film of 2018 by Cahiers du cinema. His films are often interested in the body and gender fluidity and incorporate photos and written elements. Born in 1971 in Toulouse, Mandico graduated from the film directing program at the Gobelins school in Paris. Mandico has an unusual working method. He prefers to create the audio for his films in post- production. Actors post-synchronize themselves, and the environmental sounds and music are layered on. However, he always shoots his images on color film, with no post-production images. Background projection and superimposition are done during the shoot. He created the Incoherence Manifesto in 2012 with Icelandic filmmaker Katrin Olafsdotir. He states that > To be incoherent means to have faith in cinema, it means to have a romantic > approach, unformatted, free, disturbed and dreamlike, cinegenic, an epic > narration. A group of young filmmakers including Marie Losier, Yann Gonzales, Caroline Poggi and Jonathan Vinel have been influenced by the manifesto. Mandico has commenced \\"20+1 Projections\\", a collaborative project with Romanian-American actress Elina L√∂wensohn, where they are to make 21 short films in 21 years. Though each film is meant to be a unique narrative and formal work, they are to revolve around the themes of aging and desire. As of 2018, they've shot 8 films and completed 6 of them. He was named best director at the Vilnius International Film Festival in 2018 for The Wild Boys.

Kyser served as a president of the Mineralogical Association of Canada (between 2006 and 2008) and as an Editor-in-Chief of the journal Geochemistry: Exploration, Environment, Analysis (GEEA).  Biography  Kurt Kyser was born in 1951 in Montana and grew up in San Diego, California. As a child, he was interested in entomology, but later he decided that geology is more fascinating for him. In 1974, Kyser graduated from the University of California, San Diego, then proceeding to postgraduate studies at the university branch in Berkeley, where he finished his MA studies in 1976, and PhD in Geology in 1980. His PhD became a pioneering work on the use of stable isotopes for the study of seafloor basalt. After completing a post-doctoral fellowship at the United States Geological Survey in Denver and a NATO post- doctoral fellowship at the University of Paris, Kyser returned to the North America to work at the University of Saskatchewan (Canada) as an assistant professor; in 1989 he was made a full professor. In 1995 he joined the Department of Geological Sciences and Geological Engineering at Queen's University in Kingston. There, under the guidance of Kyser, the Queen's Facility for Isotope Research (QFIR) was established and became the leading geochemistry and isotope laboratory in North America. Kyser was strongly committed to developing the next generation of geochemists and supervised circa 50 MSc and as many PHD students in the field of geochemistry during his tenure as professor, including 26 MSc and 17 PhD theses just in the second decade of the 2000s. He published over 500 peer-reviewed papers, including book chapters, books and technical reports. The bulk of his research focused on application of isotopes, uranium in particular, to mineral exploration and environmental geochemistry, although he was influential on multiple other science disciplines. Kurt Kyser was a member of the Mineralogical Association of Canada (where he served as president from 2006 to 2008), Mineralogical Society of America, American Geophysical Union, Geochemical Society of America and the Association of Applied Geochemists. During last years of his life he served as the Editor-in-Chief of the Geological Society of London's journal Geochemistry: Exploration, Environment, Analysis. He died while snorkeling, in August 2017 in Bermuda, where he was co-leading an annual field trip on carbonates. Kurt was survived by his wife, April Vuletich.  Awards  Kurt Kyser was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. His scientific achievements were recognized by professional awards from the Mineralogical Association of Canada (Past-Presidents Medal, 2001; Hawley Medal, 2002), Geological Association of Canada (Past President‚Äôs Medal; Duncan R.

It has a vaguely saucer-like shaped bell and typically has four long, lacy oral arms hanging from the bell. They usually have around twenty-four tentacles. The tentacles do contain a toxin that is capable of stinging and causing pain to humans. However, the toxin is not strong enough to prove fatal to a human, unless the toxin were to cause an allergic reaction. In 2017, C. chesapeakei was differentiated as a separate species from C. quinquecirrha. Compared to C. quinquecirrha, C. chesapeakei has a bell size that is on average half as small, usually around 10 cm. It also has fewer tentacles and longer oral arms.  Lifecycle  When the eggs of C. chesapeakei are developed, the mother jellyfish will carry them on her oral arms until the ciliated planulae develop. They will then swim until they find some sort of substrate on which to attach themselves. Typically that substrate would be something hard and rough with plenty of shade, but mostly they will attach to the shells of oysters. In either case, they begin to develop into polyps. From this point, if conditions are favorable, they will undergo a process known as strobilation occurs. This is when the polyp asexually produces the ephyrae into the water which then develop into the medusae. If conditions are not favorable, the polyps will continue in their benthic stage where they will wait for the return of favorable conditions.  Feeding  Individuals of the C. chesapeakei species are typically carnivorous. They generally feed on plankton and small marine invertebrates such as crustaceans and ctenophores. They can also act as a food source for several types of sea turtle. Due to their feeding habits, C. chesapeakei have become an important species in the Chesapeake Bay. A species of ctenophore, Mnemiopsis leidei, has had a negative impact on many of the economically important fishing industries in the Chesapeake Bay. However, due to the fact that C. chesapeakei regularly feeds on the ctenophores, this species has been kept in check. It is possible that as climate change becomes a greater issue, there may be fluctuations in the availability of the populations of both species.  Distribution  The Chesapeake Bay C. chesapeakei can be found in several different types of water, including the open ocean, brackish water, bays, and estuaries. It is most commonly found in the Chesapeake Bay which is how it got its name, but it can also be found in many bays and estuaries along the U.S. east coast and even in the Gulf of Mexico.

Its mission is the \\"promotion and protection of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) from a gender and generations' perspective\\". The headquarters are in Montevideo, where an interdisciplinary team works alongside a national and regional network of professionals and investigators. The current chairwoman is Lili√°n Abracinskas.  History  In 1996, MYSU emerged as a space for expression and coordination for various women's organisations and individuals. The space was created to be used for debate and the promotion of demands regarding SRHR in Uruguay. A good example of this is the organisation of First National Gathering regarding women's health in 2017, modelled on the yearly gathering in Argentina since 1985.. MYSU was also one of the first organisations to report on the public policies made by the National Follow-up Commission (CNSmujeres). regarding women's health and SRHR. In 2004 MYSU established itself as a non-profit, civil association. Since then they have been organising citizen campaigns to promote the legalization of abortion in Uruguay, the institution of SRHR services and the promotion of exercising rights to benefit citizens. In 2007 MYSU founded the National Observatory of Gender and Sexual and Reproductive Health. The Observatory publishes yearly studies monitoring the implementation of public policies and the quality of the national health services. These studies serve as evidence to back up demands set by citizens, which are elaborated upon by other social actors and academics. During its existence, MYSU has become part of several official Uruguayan delegations to the United Nations and has worked internationally by networking with organisations around the world. Additionally, the organisation is part of or has contacts with various other organisations, such as CNSmujeres, Red de Salud de las Mujeres Latinoamericanas y del Caribe (RSMLAC - the Women's Health Network for Latin America and the Caribbean) and the International Women's Health Coalition (IWHC). Being an organisation concerned with gender and SRHR, it has participated in multiple inter-institutional fora, such as the National Institute for Women's Uruguayan National Board for Gender, the Council for Gender Equality in Montevideo and the Open Government Network.  Promoting human rights  On their website, MYSU divides the promotion of human rights into three categories. It argues that: * The government must guarantee, respect and protect the human rights of every individual through laws and public policies, in order that citizens are able to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights. Furthermore, the distribution and assurance of the universality and completeness of sexual education and sexual and reproductive health services is vital to better the qualitative attention and access to the services. * Society must recognise and respect the human rights of every individual, without stigma or discrimination. Citizens' demands must be generated so that each person, in the entirety of the country, has the guaranteed possibility of exercising their sexual and reproductive rights. * Each person must have the capacity and power to take their own decisions in a free and informed manner regarding their reproductive and sexual life. Furthermore, they must have access to the resources necessary to be able to put their decisions into action safely, effectively and without suffering from discrimination or violence.  Lines of work  MYSU has four principal lines of work: * Incidence refers to the development of strategies to promote human rights and the inclusion of gender equality in public policies and citizenship. * Researching, writing and publishing studies about gender and health for the National Observatory of Gender and Sexual and Reproductive Health. * Promotion and communication by developing awareness-raising activities and diffusing knowledge about how to exercise and defend SRHR to organisations, groups and individuals. * Schooling, consulting and technical assistance for human resources departments, health professionals and professionals with a background in the social sciences in implementing short modes of training. Additionally, the consulting of groups, social organisations, members of parliament as well as public and private institutions at national and regional level.

Situated at 105 metres above sea level, it was the most northerly of all the forts and other military facilities built in 1809-10 under the orders of the Duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War, and commonly known as the Lines of Torres Vedras. History 152 forts, redoubts and other defences, forming three lines of defence, were constructed over 80 kilometres, reinforcing the natural obstacles that the land offered and making maximum use of the existing topography. All sites were given numbers and the Fort of Olheiros was No. 23. Incorporating a windmill that was already on the site, it is situated a few hundred metres to the northwest of the much larger Fort of S√£o Vicente, which is considered to have been the most important of the forts constructed for the Lines. Olheiros fort is an irregular polygon of seven sides, around 45 metres long by 19 metres wide. It has a pronounced stone- lined dry moat, with access having originally been over a drawbridge. There were eleven gun emplacements and a store for the munitions. In addition to covering the River Sizandro valley, as support to three forts in the Varatojo mountains and the Fort of Grillo, it was also designed to defend the western side of the Fort of S√£o Vicente. It is believed that the fort‚Äôs garrison would have totalled 180 soldiers. View of the stone-lined moat. The windmill originally on the site can be seen top left Tourism The fort, like most of the other fortifications of the Lines of Torres Vedras, was disarmed and abandoned in 1818, three years after the Congress of Vienna brought peace to Europe. Some restoration was carried out in 1957, with support from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. In 2011, the fort was restored at a cost of around ‚Ç¨ 350,000, paid for with a European Economic Area grant.

It was originally an imperial fief, part of the former lands of the Malaspina di Mulazzo family, and later became a fief of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The commune covered an area of 12 km¬≤. It was inhabited by 131 families and had a total population of 712 in 1833.  The Marquessate of Groppoli  Due to its strategic, military and commercial position, the Marquessate served as a hinge between Liguria, Lombardy and Tuscany. As such the Republic of Genoa and the Medici family competed to extend their dominance over the region. In the medieval period Groppoli formed a part of the lands held by the Malaspina family. The imperial fief of Groppoli was acquired by Count Landi of Piacenza, as the inheritance of his wife Briseide, daughter of Azzone Malaspina, and in 1549 Landi sold it to Cosimo I de' Medici. After a five-year dispute in the Imperial Aulic Council it returned to the hands of Giovan Cristoforo Malaspina.http://www.storiapatriagenova.it/Docs/Biblioteca_Digitale/SB/396b22c37e8bbc6c44c30828fc127900/d0126993af8c2e0951009cdb15b0b84c.pdf In 1576 it became autonomous again as a result of the division between the brothers Antonio Maria, Octavian, Giovannni Gaspar and Caesar, sons of Giovan Cristoforo Malaspina. But the fief did not remain in the hands of Antonio Maria for long and in March 1577 he sold it for 21,000 scudi to Francesco I de' Medici, who received the imperial investiture the following year.http://www.storiapatriagenova.it/Docs/Biblioteca_Digitale/SB/396b22c37e8bbc6c44c30828fc127900/d0126993af8c2e0951009cdb15b0b84c.pdf On 4 July 1592 Ferdinando I de' Medici granted the marquessate to Giulio Cibo SaleCibo was the Sale family‚Äôs Albergo.

Giulio's only daughter and heiress Geronima married into the Brignole family and in 1607 the lands and title passed to her two- year-old son Anton Giulio, who took the name Brignole-Sale. The Marquessate was governed at a distance and ruled by the functionaries of the Brignole-Sale family who sometimes abused their powers, especially in the early 18th century.http://www.storiapatriagenova.it/Docs/Biblioteca_Digitale/SB/396b22c37e8bbc6c44c30828fc127900/d0126993af8c2e0951009cdb15b0b84c.pdf The Marquessate was in effect independent and entered into the orbit of the Republic of Genoa. It was occupied from 1746 to 1748 by the Austrians, while Gian Francesco II Brignole-Sale was Doge of Genoa. In 1749, the Doge Gian Francesco II Brignole Sale, breaking with the policy of his predecessors, decided to directly administer his lands and dispense justice himself in an attempt to detach the Marquessate by refusing to apply the laws of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. At his death in 1760, his brother Rodolfo II Brignole-Sale inherited the Marquessate and from then on the Grand Duchy of Tuscany unceasingly attempted to recover Groppoli. In 1773, the people of Groppoli, unhappy with the fiscal policies of the Brignole-Sale family, revolted and besieged the 15th century castle. In 1774, when Rodolfo's son succeeded, he was dispossessed of his authority and power. Thereafter the Marquessate was directly administered by Tuscany.  List of Marquesses of Groppoli  * Giulio Sale, 1st Marquess of Groppoli (d. 1607), succeeded by his grandson, Giulio had a daughter and heiress named Geronima who married her first cousin Gio Francesco Brignole, Doge of Genoa. Following Giulio Sale's death in 1607 the Grand Duke of Tuscany made a second investiture of the Marquessate on 27 June 1610. In accordance with the will of Giulio Sale the remainder was limited to the male line only: * Anton Giulio Brignole-Sale, 2nd Marquess of Groppoli (1605-1662), succeeded by his son, * Rodolfo I Brignole-Sale, 3rd Marquess of Groppoli (1631-1683), succeeded by his brother, * Gio Francesco I Brignole-Sale, 4th Marquess of Groppoli (1643-1694), succeeded by his son, * Anton Giulio II Brignole-Sale, 5th Marquess of Groppoli (1673-1710), succeeded by his son, * Gio Francesco II Brignole-Sale, 6th Marquess of Groppoli (1695-1760), Doge of Genoa and 7th King of Corsica,There was a short-lived kingdom on the island of Corsica formed when the islanders crowned the German adventurer Theodor Stephan Freiherr von Neuhoff as King of Corsica in 1736. Following his downfall the island was annexed to the dominion of Genoa and the doges also became Kings of Corsica. This ended when Pasquale Paoli proclaimed the Corsican Republic in 1755. Theodore Von Neuhoff, King of Corsica: The Man Behind the Legend, p. 74, by Julia Gasper (2013), \\"At their accession, the doges of Genoa were crowned kings of Corsica. The ceremony, in which the crown was placed on their heads, not by the clergy but by fellow members of the Senate, took place every two years.\\" succeeded by his brother,It is possible that after the death of Gian Francesco II, his two younger brothers, Giuseppe and Rodolfo divided his inheritance. It is known that Ridolfo and his elder brother Giuseppe disputed the possession of Palazzo Rosso in Genoa. Finally the palace passed to Giuseppe but it is possible that in exchange he gave up the Marquessate of Groppoli. This is all the more likely since Giuseppe had only one daughter, married to prince Honor√© III of Monaco and Giuseppe feared above all that his detestable son-in-law (and wife's lover!) would inherit from him. Moreover, since the Grand Duke had abolished the imperial fiefs, the Brignoles were in fact seceded from their overlord and it is reasonable to imagine that an old doge like Rodolfo had the prestige and necessary support to make this situation last a few more years. * Giuseppe Brignole-Sale, 7th Marquess of Groppoli (1703-1769), succeeded by his brother, His only surviving child was Maria Caterina Brignole, who married Honor√© III, Prince of Monaco and became ancestor of the Princes of Monaco. However she did not succeed to the Marquessate, which passed to her father Giuseppe's brother, * Rodolfo II Brignole-Sale, 8th Marquess of Groppoli (1708-1774), Doge of Genoa, succeeded by his son, In 1774 the Marquessate was annexed to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the heirs were left with the title only: * Anton Giulio III Brignole-Sale, 9th Marquess of Groppoli (1764-1802), succeeded by his son, * Rodolfo III Brignole-Sale, 10th Marquess of Groppoli (1784-1832), ordained in 1806 and renounced the title, succeeded by his brother, * Anton Giulio IV Brignole- Sale, 11th Marquess of Groppoli (1786-1863), succeeded by his daughter (became dormant) Under the terms of the second investiture of 27 June 1610 (which limited the title to the male line) the Marquessate became extinct at his death. However, under the terms of the original investiture of 1592 the title was able to pass through the female line (the 2nd Marquess having succeeded in this way). When the 11th Marquess died in 1863, Italian law would have required that the succession to the title by his daughter Maria be confirmed by the new King of Italy. Since Maria made no such request, the title became dormant: * Maria Brignole-Sale, Duchess of Galliera, 12th Marchioness of Groppoli (1811-1888), never used the title Maria married Raffaele de Ferrari, Duke of Galliera. At her death the succession to the title is somewhat unclear since her only surviving son, the well-known stamp collector Philipp von Ferrary, renounced his titles. It appears then that at the death of the Duchess of Galliera in 1888 the dormant title passed to John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton, the heir at line of the Brignole-Sale family (the only grandchild of Pellina Brignole-Sale, sister of the 11th Marquess and wife of Emmeric, Duc de Dalberg): * John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton, 13th Marquess of Groppoli (1834-1902), succeeded by his son, * Richard Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 2nd Baron Acton, 14th Marquess of Groppoli (1870-1924), succeeded by his son, * John Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 3rd Baron Acton, 15th Marquess of Groppoli (1907-1989), succeeded by his son, In 1946, the Kingdom of Italy was replaced by a republic. Under the Italian Constitution adopted in 1948, titles of nobility are not legally recognised. * Richard Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 4th Baron Acton, 16th Marquess of Groppoli (1941-2010), succeeded by his son, * John Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 5th Baron Acton, 17th Marquess of Groppoli (b. 1966) See also * Gio Francesco Brignole * Anna Pieri Brignole Sale * Giacomo Luigi Brignole * Giacomo Maria Brignole * Duke of Galliera * Consulta araldica * Corpo della Nobilt√† Italiana * List of marquesses in Italy * Libro d'Oro * Annuario della Nobilt√† Italiana  References  External links * Nobiliary and Aristocratic History * European Royal Houses * Il Corpo della Nobilt√† Italiana Italian nobility Groppoli ","title":"Marquess of Groppoli"},{"id":"60106944","text":"Antoine Merle (22 March 1921 - May 2013) was a French wrestler.

Early life Julia Graydon Sharpe was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. She was the daughter of Joseph Kinne and Mary Ellen (Graydon) Sharpe. Her father was a leather merchant and real estate operator. As a young girl, Sharpe attended local private schools in Indianapolis as well as the Chegaray Institute, in Philadelphia, for instruction in voice. She returned to Indianapolis at age twenty-one and enrolled in Love and Gookins' First Indiana School of Art from 1878 to 1880. Sharpe's art career underwent a hiatus as her father struggled through the depression of the 1870s, and she pursued social activities.

In the fall of 1898, Sharpe took her six-year-old niece with her on a sketching trip to the mountains of West Virginia. When she returned to Indianapolis in 1907, Sharpe continued studying art with J. Ottis Adams at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis and Will Vawter in Brown County, Indiana. Although not an official member of the \\"Hoosier Group,\\" Sharpe studied under three of its well known members: Steele, and Adams.

Video 3:25 m. Abortion in Kenya is prohibited with the exception of certain circumstances including danger to the life and health of the expectant mother, and rape. Unsafe abortions are a major cause of deaths and health complications in Kenya. Legislative policy Abortion in Kenya is regulated by Article 26(IV) of the Constitution of Kenya, which states that: Unsafe abortions are a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in Kenya. The 2010 Kenyan constitutional referendum that introduced article 26 broadened access to abortion by allowing it for maternal health reasons. The National Council of Churches of Kenya, which feared it would lead to the legalisation of abortion, opposed the amendment. Pregnancies that are the result of a rape can be terminated by experts, a June 2019 judgment by the Supreme Court ruled. The court was compelled to advise health workers to provide safe and legal abortion in a petition by the Kenyan Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA). Statistics A survey of 2012 by the Kenyan Ministry of Health, African Population and Health Research Center and IPSAS found that there were 464,000 abortions induced that year, which translates to an abortion rate of 48 per 1,000 women aged 15‚Äì49; and an abortion ratio of 30 per 100 live births. About half (49 %) of all pregnancies in Kenya were unintended and 41 % of unintended pregnancies ended in an abortion. Marie Stopes International estimates that 2,600 women die from unsafe abortions annually, an average seven deaths a day. Nearly 120,000 women are hospitalized each year due to abortion-related complications. The publication of these statistics in 2018 and the death of activist Caroline Mwatha in February 2019 following an unsafe abortion had brought the debate on abortion to the forefront in 2019.

Associated with, and at times inspired by, French Jacobinism and republicanism, it corresponded to the political current known more generally as Radicalism.  The War of Independence and the Constitution of 1812  The Exaltados emerged following the Spanish War of Independence (1808-1814) against the French Empire. The old absolute monarchy of the Bourbons had been replaced with a Napoleonic monarchy which, inspired by the Enlightenment, was autocratic in nature but moderately progressive in content. The war had therefore divided the country. Some Spaniards, known as Afrancescados (roughly, the Francophiles) supported the new regime because of its Enlightened direction. Many others opposed it because of both its progressivism and its foreign origins, wishing to restore the absolute monarchy. But a significant number of Spaniards opposed the Napoleonic regime due to its foreign origins or autocratic nature, while agreeing with some or all of the principles of the French Revolution. These became known as the Liberals. They fought not to restore the absolutist and traditionalist Ancien Regime but for a political system equivalent to, but separate from, the French Republic: an Enlightened, constitutional and parliamentary regime proper to the Spanish nation. At the end of the War of Independence Joseph Bonaparte and the troops of the French Empire were expelled before the deposed King Ferdinand VII had time to return to office. In the interim, the various liberal factions organised elections to establish a Constituent assembly, the Cortes of C√°diz, to create a national constitution inspired by Enlightenment and French Revolutionary principles: the Constitution of C√°diz (1812).  The Three Liberal Years (1820-23) and the Veintea√±istas  After the restoration of the absolute monarchy in 1814, the liberal tradition of 1812 split in two:Charles W. Fehrenbach. \\"Moderados and Exaltados: The Liberal Opposition to Ferdinand VII, 1814-1823.\\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 50, no. 1 (1970): 52. * Those known as Moderados (Moderates) were the more socially- conservative liberals who sought not to revolutionise society or culture but merely constitutionalise the monarchy. As they sought to do so by restoring the suspended Constitution of 1812, they came to be labelled Docea√±istas, or 'Supporters of the Constitution of 1812'. They could be thought of as counterparts to the French Republic's Girondin faction. * The more hardline liberal faction became known as Exaltados. They rejected the Moderates' compromises with the absolute monarchy, in favour of a new regime with greater progressive and democratic content than the Constitution of 1812. Because they sought a brand new constitution for the year 1820 they were labelled Veintea√±istas ('Supporters of the Constitution of 1820'), though their proposed constitution never materialised. They also sought a more root-and- branch revolution than the Moderates, hoping to transform society and culture with Enlightenment values rather than merely setting out the legal rules for parliamentary government. The Exaltados could thus roughly be thought of as the counterpart of the French Republic's Jacobin faction, or the contemporary Carbonari in Italy.I. M. Zavala. \\"La prensa exaltada en el trienio constitucional: 'El Zurriago'\\". Bulletin Hispanique, vol. 69, n¬∞3-4, 1967. pp. 384. The term Exaltados came from the group's more radical and revolutionary form of liberalism, as well as their concern to revolutionise culture with the values of the Enlightenment within the context of Romanticism. In common with Radicals elsewhere, they regarded the Revolution as an ongoing process of permanent progress. In constitutional terms, they envisaged limiting the monarchy to a highly restricted role, that of executing the will of parliament. If a new constitution were not possible, they sought to implement to the letter the more transformative elements of the Constitution of 1812, complemented by legislation. Their legislative programme consisted of measures that would lead to the eradication of institutions associated with the Ancien Regime: the transformation of property from feudal to capitalist ownership (disentailment of feudal properties, abolition of aristocratic titles). In religious affairs they sought a system of laicity, with the dissolution of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) a particular demand. They sought a three-level educational reform, and a territorial reorganisation into rational provinces on the model of the French d√©partments. The group's social base consisted of the urban middle classes, as well as a large portion of the new generation of military officers that had been produced by the War of Independence. This latter group, of middling to humble social origins and influenced by the ideas of the French Revolution, had a grievance against Ferdinand VII for demobilising them after the war. Among their most prominent members were President of Parliament and General Rafael de Riego, General Francisco Espoz y Mina, the future heads of government Jos√© Mar√≠a Calatrava and Juan √Ålvarez Mendiz√°bal, and the future minister Antonio Alcal√° Galiano. The Exaltados were particularly prominent at the beginning and end of the Three Liberal Years. After playing an active role in the initial Revolution of 1820, they were sidelined for two years by the more socially-conservative liberal Moderates. The Exaltados were brought back to power in July 1822, when the National Militia was mobilised to suppress the Royal Guards' attempted counter- revolution. The Exaltados leveraged the situation to have one of their own elected President of Government, Evaristo San Miguel. In response, in 1823 the French absolute monarch Louis XVIII led an invasion to restore the deposed Ferdinand VII. The restoration of the absolute monarchy led to a ten-year period of repression against the Exaltados, including the execution of Riego. Chased out of the parliamentary sphere, radical liberals turned to clandestine organisation (carbonarism) or pronunciamientos by sympathetic military officers.  The Isabelline Monarchy and the Progressive Party  Ferdinand VII died in 1833, succeeded by his daughter Isabel II. Isabel's young age allowed a series of regents to pivot the monarchy in a new direction; this came at a time when several European monarchies were undergoing internal conservative-liberal democratisation: the Isabelline period fell into a similar line as the French July Monarchy of 1830, the Belgian Revolution of 1830-31, and the English Great Reform of 1832. Under the Regency, the repression of the Exaltados was ended, allowing them to organise themselves into a new political faction. By 1834 the Spanish Congress of Deputies had a sizeable faction of former Exaltados and like-minded radical democrats; by 1836 many, though not all, of them had organised themselves into a more structured entity, the Progressive Party. The Progressive Party ended up as one of the two main Spanish political parties between 1834 and 1870, alternating in power with the more conservative, but still liberal, Moderate Party. This rapprochement between the radical-liberal and conservative-liberal traditions was facilitated by the emergence of Carlism, an ultra-royalist movement that opposed parliamentary government and wished to restore the absolute monarchy. In 1835 Queen Regent Maria Cristina named a veteran Exaltado, Juan √Ålvarez Mendiz√°bal, as president of government (prime minister), with the Progressives forming the core of his parliamentary support. However, the Queen Regent's refusal to issue a constitutional charter recognising the principle of national sovereignty alienated the Progressives. They insisted on a return to the Constitution of 1812, or the drafting of a more progressive constitution. In 1837 a revolt by radical military officers prompted Maria Cristina to again appoint a government of Exaltados and accede to the demands of the Progressives, who held a majority in congress. The result was the Constitution of 1837, a compromise between the two liberal parties, the more radical Progressives and the more conservative Moderates. This constitution upheld several of the fundamental principles of the Exaltado tradition, notably citizens' juries, a citizens' National Militia, and a bill of citizens' rights; the radicals compromised on other areas, such as the affirmation of the principle of popular national sovereignty, the ceremonial role of the monarchy, and the abolition of the Senate. By 1840 relations between the radical-liberal and conservative-liberal groups had soured. A reform of local administration by one Moderate government, seen as a power- grab by the Progressive deputies, prompted the latter to walk out of parliament and demand that the widely popular war hero General Espartero be appointed regent to preserve the spirit of the constitution. Espartero's autocratic rule (1840‚Äì43) quickly disillusioned them and the Exaltados united with the Moderates to oust him. Relations between the two liberal parties had soured, leading the Moderates to turn to the absolutists for support, and draft a distinctly more conservative constitution in 1845. This sparked fears that the Progressives would henceforth be excluded from government. At this moment of volatility, the example of the Revolutions of 1848 in Europe prompted a shake-up of the Spanish parliamentary system: * The Democratic Progressive Party (more formally, the Democratic Progressive Party) was formed in 1849 by the left-wing Progressives. These had long been demanding a root- and-branch institutional reform of the Isabelline Monarchy. In 1848 were inspired by the example of the proclamation of the Second Republic in France. They now took a hard-line on universal suffrage and a republican state, leaving to form a new party dedicated to these principles. The Democrats considered their new party to be the true heir to the radical tradition of the Exaltados. * The Liberal Union was formed (1858) as a synthesis of the various centrist liberal currents to the right of the Democrats. Unlike the republican and universal-suffragist Democrats, the party remnants accepted constitutional monarchy and a suffrage restricted to property-owners; this brought them close to the position of the conservative-liberals on the centrist wing of the Moderate Party. As a result, the centrist wing of both parties merged to form the Liberal Union. * A small number of Progressives remained loyal to the original party, which faded into insignificance. This realignment of parties brought political instability. As the Moderates veered to the right over the 1840s, the Democrats and Progressives pressed for a change in government. A revolution in 1852, mirroring those elsewhere in Europe in 1848, backed by the progressive general Espartero and the centre-right General O'Donnell brought the Progressives to power; they were ousted in 1854 after a second revolution by O'Donnell. After the Revolution of 1854, O'Donnell gathered to him the moderate elements from the Progressive Party and the liberal elements from the Moderate Party, forming the Liberal Union which dominated Spanish government from 1858 to 1868.  The Glorious Revolution (1868) and the First Republic (1870-72)  By 1863, the radical wing of the Progressive Party had split; by 1888 these had formed the Radical Democratic Party, known informally as the Radical Party.  Radical Republicanism and the Second Republic (1931-39)  Before and during the Second Republic, the main political party of the republican left, the Radical Socialist Republican Party, was associated with the Exaltado tradition.

Best known for her work on dementia praecox, she researched the social as well as the biological causes of mental illness. Pascal founded one of the first ‚Äòmedical-pedagogic‚Äô institutes in France. Her monograph, Chagrins d'amour et psychoses (1935), reflected her wide cultural interests. Early life and education Constance Pascal was born on 22 August 1877 in Pite≈üti, a small town near Bucharest. She began her schooling in Romania, then came to France for her medical training. Pascal gained a degree in medicine from the University of Paris, one of the few universities that, at the end of the 19th century, admitted female students, including foreigners. Her thesis entitled Formes atypiques de la paralysie g√©n√©rale: pr√©dominance r√©gionales des l√©sions dans les m√©ningoenc√©phalites diffuses (The atypical forms of general paralysis) was published in 1905 and celebrated as \\"both a feminine and a feminist success.\\" In 1903, Pascal benefited from the press campaign that her colleague Madeleine Pelletier had conducted with the support of the feminist newspaper La Fronde to support the eligibility of women for all types of medical specialisation, most relevantly to the examination for psychiatric internships. Psychiatric career When Jean-Martin Charcot (1825‚Äì1893) took over the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital in Paris, the hospital became celebrated as a neuropsychiatric teaching centre, represented on canvas in 1887 by A Clinical Lesson at the Salp√™tri√®re by Andr√© Brouillet. By the early twentieth century when Pascal entered psychiatric medicine, French medical doctors who wanted to specialise in neurology or psychiatry were required to do an internship at the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital. At this time, Salp√™tri√®re was not on the list of Paris hospitals because it was considered a university and clinic rather than a real psychiatric hospital. After completing her internship at Salp√™tri√®re, Pascal became a psychiatrist alienist in Charenton-le-Pont as doctor-in-chief, then doctor-chef in Pr√©montr√© in 1920 and in Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne in 1922. In 1925, she was assigned to the post of physician director of the Roger-Pr√©vot Hospital Center in Moisselles where with Jean Davesne where she wrote Treatment of mental illnesses by shocks. In 1927, Pascal became chief physician in Maison Blanche near Paris. In 1935, Pascal published Chagrins d'amour et psychoses, a book centred on the psychoses caused by affective traumas. Pascal remained at Maison Blanche until her death after a long illness in 1937. Personal life During the First World War, following a relationship with General Justin Mangin, she gave birth to Jeanne in 1916. The names of the parents are not specified in the birth certificate and Jeanne was registered as a daughter of unknown father and mother. In 1924, Pascal adopted Jeanne, who was not told the truth about her birth until adulthood. Constance Pascal died at Neuilly- sur-Marne on 21 December 1937 of breast cancer after a long illness.

The canal system includes multiple lateral canals that distribute water to approximately 165,000 acres of farmland in the Boise Valley. The canal has a capacity of 2,400 cubic feet per second. History Completion of the Oregon Short Line Railroad in the early 1880s made possible the construction of farming settlements in the Boise Valley. In 1882 investors from New York founded the Idaho Mining and Irrigation Company in order to transform the desert into farmland between the Boise River and the Snake River in southern Idaho Territory. Investors hoped that the company could also begin mining operations in the region, financed by revenue from irrigation canals. Mining engineer Arthur De Wint Foote commenced a survey of the Boise Valley in 1883, and he envisioned a 75-mile canal that would draw water from the south side of the Boise River and irrigate a half-million acres of desert through 5000 lateral ditches. The Main Canal became known as New York Canal in deference to eastern investors. The New York Canal was not the first irrigation system in the Boise Valley. In 1878 William H. Ridenbaugh began construction of the Ridenbaugh Canal from the north side of the Boise River, and smaller projects had existed beginning in the 1860s. In the 1880s work on the New York Canal focused mainly on the Foote survey and on acquiring water rights. The Idaho Mining and Irrigation Company began construction near the Boise River Canyon about 10 miles east of Boise City, and work required moving boulders and cutting rock. The difficulty of work partially accounted for slow progress on the canal, but another factor was the Depression of 1882‚Äì85, and some eastern investors had been forced to divest their holdings in the company. Arthur Foote continued to work with little pay, and the company allowed only a minimum construction effort, this to retain its water rights. In 1888 the Idaho Statesman objected to claims that the New York Canal would be completed that year. The newspaper found that \\"maps and profiles\\" were the only work finished, and the editor projected that the canal would require 500 workers over five years before it was completed. In 1889 Idaho Mining and Irrigation Company manager Charles H. Tompkins, Jr., estimated that the canal would be 70 miles long and irrigate about 350,000 acres with an estimated capacity of 2915 cubic feet of water per second, but he admitted that only two miles of the canal had been completed. Another Boise River project undertaken by the company, the Phyllis Canal, named for investors from Philadelphia, also had completed about two miles. The Phyllis Canal later became part of the New York Canal system. In 1890 the company secured investment capital of $300,000 to complete work on the canal. The general contractor was Denver railroad builder William C. Bradbury, and the company believed the canal would be finished in 1891. By September, 1890, 220 workers were employed, and the company advertised employment for 1000 workers. But progress on the canal continued into 1892, when work stopped because of disagreements between investors. Work resumed in 1893. The Idaho Mining and Irrigation Company became insolvent in 1891, and contractor Bradbury filed a lien against the company that year. Bradbury continued construction on the canal, apparently financed by his own money. He purchased the canal, right of way, and water rights in a sheriff's auction in 1894. He later sold the uncompleted canal to the Farmers' Canal Company, an association of about 175 local farmers, in 1896. Congress created the United States Reclamation Service in 1902, and the bureau gained control of the New York Canal project. After trimming several miles from the former design and completing construction of the canal and diversion dam, the bureau opened the New York Canal on February 22, 1909. The canal was enlarged by 1912, and it was placed under control of the Boise Project in 1926.

It reached its peak of production in 1895 when it had 50,000 spindles and 748 looms. However, by 1899 the building had been sold to Messrs Hoyle, Parker and Company who turned the premises into a shoe factory. The building was once again used for textile production in the 1930s, and by 1954 two associated companies, James Rothwell and Fabricade Ltd occupied the building, working alongside one another. Fabricade made bed spreads and bathroom sets there until 1981, when they shut the plant down with the loss of 60 jobs. The building was put on the market for ¬£85,000. The Council developed plans to turn the mill into a new Town Hall for the Borough of Rossendale which had been formed in 1974. The plans, which also involved the Rawtenstall Civic Society, the Lancashire Constabulary and the local Chamber of Commerce. They included Council administrative offices, a chamber for Council meetings and members facilities, as well as a police custody facilities, a community hall and tourist information office. The remaining space had yet to be allocated. The project received ¬£4m from the Heritage Lottery Fund, English Heritage and English Partnerships. It was proposed that the renovation would be completed with minimum demolition and preservings as much as possible of the internal open space.

An active supporter of women's rights, in 1880 together with Eug√©nie Pierre, she founded the Union des femmes, the first socialist women's association in France. As a writer, in 1872 she published two novels: Le Monde renvers√© (The World Turned Upside Down) and Voyage de Th√©odose √† l'√Æle de l'Utopie (A Voyage to the Isle of Utopia). Biography Born on 6 September 1839 in Paris, Louise-L√©onie Camusat was the daughter of a watchmaker. In 1860, after working as an embroiderer, she married Auguste Rouzade, an accountant in Meudon where they settled. Le vote des femmes Encouraged by her husband, she spent her spare time promoting the cause of working-class women by writing two feminist novels: Voyage de Th√©odose √† l'√Æle de l'Utopie and Le Monde renvers√©. In the former, the shipwrecked Th√©odose discovers an island where everyone works harmoniously for only four hours a day enjoying complete equality between men and women. In the latter, a woman confined to a harem in the Middle East leads a revolt, imposing a new code of law based on men obeying the rule of women. In 1878, Rouzade participated in the International Congress of Women where she met Hubertine Auclert who encouraged her to support Droit des femmes which she founded the following year. After it was merged with the Parti ouvrier (Workers Party), Rouzade wrote for the journal Le Prol√©taire and spoke at party conferences. On 28 February 1880, Le Prol√©taire announced that the Union des femmes (UdF) had been established by L√©onie Rouzade and Eug√©nie Pierre. Rouzade spoke at the organization's first meeting on 13 April 1880. That June, she represented the UdF at the Paris region socialist organization Union f√©d√©rative du centre and at the 1880 Cong√®s du Havre. She continued to speak at socialist functions until 1882 when she retired from active campaigning after facing strong opposition as a socialist candidate for the 12th Paris arrondissement in the 1881 municipal elections. In 1891, she joined La Solida des femmes founded by Eug√©nie Potoni√©-Pierre but left the organization around 1901 after the founder's death. L√©onie Rouzade died in mid-October 1916.

She was a prominent artist in the period following the dictatorship of the National Reorganization Process. She was a key figure who participated in the artistic scene since the early 80's, starring the enthusiastic young bohemian that detonated Buenos Aires from the early years of democracy rapidly becoming an inflection figure. Her works included objects, installations, performances, interventions in public and semipublic places, and the photographic performances.

Di√°logo. 20 (1): 133‚Äì140  Biography  Liliana Maresca was born in Argentina on May 8, 1951 into a middle class family. Little is known about her early childhood, other than that by the age of nineteen, she was living on her own in Belgrano, Buenos Aires. She studied at the Escuela Nacional de Cer√°mica, the National School of Ceramics in Mexico. Maresca always opted to show her works of sculptures and installations in unconventional settings and with unexpected materials. For example, Maresca organized the group show Lavarte at a laundromat. She was considered to be the \\"cultural communicator of the eighties\\" by her peer Marcia Schvartz (b.1955) because of how she created sculptures and installations that broke free from artistic expectations. She later became a professor in the graphic design department at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and directed her own plastic arts workshops. Her first collective exhibition was around 1983 at Espacio Giesso in Buenos Aires. Her house in San Telmo hosted a community of Argentinian artists and local cultural or artistic events. She died in Buenos Aires in 1994 at the age of 43 from causes related to the HIV virus, while she was preparing a retrospective exhibition.  Education  Liliana Maresca studied painting at the Escuele Nacional de Cer√°mica with Renato Benedetti, drawing with Miguel Angel Bengochea, and sculpturing with Emilio Renart. She later became a professor in the graphic design department at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and directed her own plastic arts workshops.\\"Liliana Maresca. Biography\\". cvaa.com.ar. Retrieved 2019-02-03.  Art works  Liliana Maresca's first public artistic appearance was in 1983 when she took part in a group exhibition at Estudio Giesso. A short time later she presented her first solo exhibition at El Porte√±o magazine. In this solo exhibition, Maresca was photographed by Argentinian photographer Marcos Lopez. These photographs show Maresca posing nude with a white mask. Some have interpreted this work as a commentary on both race and gender, with the white mask complicating Maresca's Latina identity. Additionally, the mask obstructs her face, giving the viewer access only to her nude figure. A year later in 1984, she participated in Kriptonita verde, an exhibition prepared by the Museo Juan Carlos Castagnino in Mar del Plata. In 1985, two important happenings mark the career of Lialiana Maresca. Along with Ezequiel Furgiuele, with whom she formed Grupo Haga, Maresca made a scarf measuring 328 feet long, composed of rags found in the neighborhood of El Once; the work was titled Una bufanda para la ciudad de Buenos Aires (A scarf for the city of Buenos Aires). That same year, she also organized a group show entitled Lavarte meaning \\"wash yourself\\" in an automatic laundrette in Bartolom√© Mitre Street. Liliana Maresca was a key figure who participated in the artistic scene since the early 80's, starring the enthusiastic young bohemian that detonated Buenos Aires from the early years of democracy rapidly becoming an inflection figure, which initiates and develops many of the avant-garde that characterize the art of 90's. Documents of installations and performances convey a comprehensive panorama of an artistic production that spanned the period between 1983 and 1993.\\"Liliana Maresca\\". www.mutualart.com. Retrieved 2019-03-13. In 1990, the artist presented the installation Recolecta (Collects), which had the main theme of shopping cart like those pushed by vagrants on city streets where she created replicas of the carts that she called a \\"national symbol\\". Painted all white or in gold and silver, the carts were meant to critique the suffering of the socially marginalized. A year after, at 1991, she exhibited Our√≥boros, an object made ip of unbound books forming the mythical serpent that devours itself, at the Facultad de Filosof√≠a y Letras. In 1992, her most conceptual work was created with the installation of Espacio disponible (Space available) at the Centro Cultural Recoleta. For this piece Maresca placed a signboard advertising the availability of the space \\"for any purposes\\" and included her name and telephone number and two dates. A few months later and with the help of colleagues, Maresca published in El Libertino fourteen erotic photographs of herself under a title suggesting a connection to the ad she had earlier presented and again including her name and telephone number. Both works revealed her interest in the performativity of the language of advertising and the expectations paced on the artist as a maker of objects and fantasies.  Performance  Her body of works includes painting, objects, sculptures, installations, performances. Her artworks reflected the neo-dada spirit, the minimalist models, and the conceptual strategies that dominated the art scene in the second half of the century in Argentina.  Photography  From a post- avantgarde, post-utopian point of view, all the paradoxical, body- and object- based photo-performances which Liliana Maresca was associated and obsessed since the 1980s and through her death in 1994. In 1982, Marcos Lopez, photographer from Argentina, began to frequent Liliana's place. Over the next year, he made a series of black and white photographs. In those shots, Maresca was completely naked, surrounded by and interacting with her own artworks, granting each one of them a particular meaning.\\"BLACK FEMINIST THEATRES IN CULTURAL CONTEXT\\", CONTEMPORARY FEMINIST THEATRES, Taylor & Francis, pp. 148‚Äì181, , retrieved 2019-03-11 The object entitled ‚ÄúCarozo de durazno (Peach pit)‚Äù ‚Äì an oversized vagina molded in foam rubber ‚Äì appears in another image tenderly cradled in the arms of the artist, an ironic suggestion of how to treat the intimate female body. In the series Maresca se entrega a todo destino (Maresca surrenders to any destiny) strategies and contents are concatenated with the installation entitled Espacio Disponible (Available space) (1992). The erotic performance was made to be published in the October issue of the El Libertino magazine in 1993. In 1993 the Maresca-L√≥pez duo reunites again to perform the latest photo shots, which were commissioned for the posters and postcard of the exhibition invitation Imagen p√∫blica ‚Äì altas esferas (Public image - High spheres). The shooting took place in Liliana Maresca's house along with the oversized prints of images from P√°gina 12 newspaper produced to create and constitute such installation. Above them, Maresca lies naked in sexy attitudes and Lopez, from a mezzanine took zenithal photos. The latest series is a derivation of the work Imagen p√∫blica ‚Äì altas esferas (Public image - High spheres). With the gigantographies, big scale prints, used to constitute the installation, the artist recreated a new installation in the east end of the Ecological Reserve located in the Costanera Sur of Buenos Aires.\\"2.

With these technologies, smart ports can also improve environmental sustainability. In an ideal smart port, processes would be automated and connected via IoT.  Concept  Smart ports employ smart technology solutions to increase efficiency, effectiveness and security by making ports more environmentally sustainable, economically efficient and capable of handling increased port traffic.  Efficiency  Due to the increasing size and volume of container, transport and cruise ships, ports continue to face new challenges with daily traffic and processing. Technologies such as IoT can improve warehouse logistics, inventory management etc. and help automate loading, dispatching and transporting goods. In smart ports, parking spaces could be optimised and traffic streamlined by making more efficient use of limited space. Sensors, cameras, drones and other technologies can automatically collect and share information such as weather, traffic and pollution data for port owners and customers. Optimizing workflow could double capacity without having to additional space or having to invest in new infrastructure and equipment, while simultaneously reducing operation costs. Making a port ‚Äúsmart‚Äù not only means digitally connecting everything inside the port, but also requires multilevel cooperation among government authorities, businesses, local communities and other relevant parties. Shared data from smart ports also requires standardisation so that it could be better utilised by people in different countries and locations. The latest information from international business intelligence provider Visiongain, assesses that Smart Ports Market spending will reach $1.5 bn in 2019. A smart port takes complete advantage of space, produces higher revenues, saves natural resources and benefits from the technology accessible to the logistics community. Artificial intelligence could assist with security checks and automated screening processes, not only helping to standardise and lower the durations of those tasks, but also making them safer, more reliable and less dependent on human failure.  Economics  In order to remain economically competitive, ports need to efficiently streamline workflow and minimise costs. If the optimal traffic flow for ships can be determined automatically, the cargo loading and unloading times can be optimised to save time so that more ships and cargo can be cleared in less time. Local natural resources such as petroleum can also serve as incentives for port development, leading to long- term trade and economic development for an entire area. At the same time, as automation is potentially able to lower overhead and costs, smart ports can become less financially dependent on political authorities, allowing increased flexibility for private investments and improvements.  Environmental sustainability  Ports have historically suffered from high levels of environmental pollution. However, smart ports can limit energy consumption and waste by making use of automation and smart technologies. Hamburg, for example, has a system of sensors, cameras and smart lights on roads to help monitor and direct traffic, which can help to optimize traffic and thus lower emissions. These large public infrastructural development projects typically require significant cooperation from various agencies and government authorities.  Development  Ports have always served an important function for the transfer of goods. Before the Industrial Revolution, ports had functioned as trade centers and marketplaces that would develop into centers for cross-cultural exchange, social development and demographic settlement. In the 21st century, as ports merge with big data, artificial intelligence and IoT, the port is beginning to be seen as an interconnected smart environment bringing together different port sectors and even other ports. The whole supply chain is integrated while making autonomous, intelligent choices.Barcelona Activa and Ajuntament de Barcelona, ‚ÄúThe evolution of sea transport: 4th generation ports\\", retrieved 4th May 2019 To help build a network of highly connected and technologically advanced smart ports all over the world, the Hamburg Port Authority started the chainPORT initiative in collaboration with ports like Los Angeles, Montreal, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Barcelona, Felixstowe, Singapore and Busan, to share and disseminate the concept of smart ports. The maritime industry has been testing blockchain technology since 2017 and several shipping companies have partnered with tech companies to create blockchain shipping systems to improve maritime logistics.  Criticisms  Since smart ports would have to deal with big data and operate using surveillance, data privacy and security are potential areas of concern. Concerns include questions of who will have access to the data, and how networks can be protected from hacking and sabotage. Others criticise the term ‚Äúsmart‚Äù as frequently overused and exaggerated by IoT advocates for marketing purposes, while a truly ‚Äúsmart‚Äù environment should be able to learn and interact. A port ecosystem consists of multiple parties that take on a diverse range of tasks and responsibilities, with each party having different priorities for port development. Currently, the smart port approach is frequently being promoted by port authorities. However, successfully developing a smart port requires a more holistic multi-stakeholder approach that would require large-scale cooperation on many different levels. Another problem with automation is the mass replacement of human workers, which has already led to protests in places such as the Port of Los Angeles. Automation also cannot be utilised to its full potential if there is a lack of basic infrastructure, such as when there is insufficient capacity for containers or inadequate port area size. In such circumstances, the real cost of implementing smart port technologies can actually outweigh the benefits.

In 1895 he moved to Hong Kong to join a firm of solicitors there, becoming a partner in Deacon, Looker and Deacon. Following his retirement in 1919 he returned to England to live in Great Baddow, near Chelmsford and began a political career.

Construction hoarding for Katong Park MRT station can be seen in the background Katong Park is neighborhood park located in Katong, Singapore at the junction of Meyer Road and Fort Road. Built in the 1930s above the buried remains of Fort Tanjong Katong, it was one of Singapore‚Äôs oldest parks with the first public bathing pagar (sea swimming enclosure) and was highly popular with families during the weekends. After the coastal reclamation works in the 1970s, the park lost its sea frontage and declined greatly in popularity. It now remains as a small community park serving nearby residents.  History   Before the park  Fort Tanjong Katong, one of the oldest military forts built by the formal British Colonial Government of Singapore, once stood at the location of where Katong Park currently stands. It was built in 1879 to as part of a series of defensive batteries and fortifications along the southern coast of Singapore to defend against Russian invaders. Fort Road is named after said fort. Swimmers were said to have came by sampan from Johnston‚Äôs Pier to bathe off the military pier off Katong Fort. The fort was abandoned and buried in 1901 due to its poor structural design and remoteness.It was rediscovered twice, once in 1950 and again in 2001. Although they had known of the fort‚Äôs existence in 1950, it was only during improvement works in the park that the actual walls were discovered. One of the gun turrets was scooped out and turned into a toddler‚Äôs sandpit and there had been plans to outline the top of the walls but it was not carried out. The walls were rediscovered again in 2001 by Mr Jack Sim, a Katong resident and founder of the World Toilet Organization. The fort has since been considered by local experts to be one of Singapore‚Äôs most important archaeological finds, being the only \\"true 19th century fort\\" to date . However, as of 2010, the National Heritage Board has stated that it has no plans to gazette the fort for the time being. The fort was mostly reburied with sand to protect it from the elements until a future decision is made.  Bathing pagar days   Construction  The park was first mentioned in the 1928 Straits Settlements Annual Report (SSAR) by Director of Gardens, Mr R.E Holttum, indicating that a plan for the layout of the park was submitted. In the 1920s, there was an influx of Chinese and Indian immigrants to the Katong area due to the rapid growth of central Singapore. As there was limited land for expansion in the area towards Telok Blangah, many of them moved east towards Katong onto land that was freed up due to the fragmentation of plantations. Increased infrastructure and amenities were built to support the increased population. Katong Park was opened on 19 December 1931 by W Bartley, President of the Municipal Commissioners. It was Singapore‚Äôs first public sea swimming enclosure, in contrast to other existing bathing pagars in the Katong area such as the Singapore Swimming Club and privately owned pagars of mansions. Katong Park‚Äôs bathing pagar was 50 yards (~45m) in length and extended 100 feet (~30m) into the sea. The park also had a bandstand, changing rooms and a playground. Food was sold in the Silver Owl Cafe as well as by vendors along Meyer Road.  Japanese occupation  During the Japanese Occupation, mechanical testing bays were constructed to service aircraft engines from Kallang Airfield, overseen by Yasuda Butai. An old warehouse that existed before the war was also integrated into the factory. These bays were then used as rest sheds for the park in the post war years.  Events  Every weekend, a British military band would perform on stage. Events such as concerts and sea carnivals was also held at Katong Park. The sea carnival was held annually in conjunction with Police Week and included activities such as boat races, night markets and wayang performances. The largest event held at Katong Park was Aneka Ragam Ra'ayat (People‚Äôs Cultural Concert), a series of government sponsored public concerts that aimed at promoting mutual understanding between different cultural groups. The concert were held at multiple locations throughout Singapore with performances by different ethnic groups, attracting large crowds.  Bombings  The park was so popular that it was targeted by the Indonesians during the Konfrontasi. A total of three bombs went off in September and October 1963. There were no casualties, with only property damage to nearby cars as well as the windows of the Ambassador Hotel opposite the park.  Decline in popularity  Land reclamation works along Singapore‚Äôs east coast began in 1966, lasting for over 30 years. Dubbed as the ‚ÄúGreat Reclamation‚Äù, it added a 1,525 hectares tract along the southeastern coast of the island. Between 1966 and 191, 458 hectares of land and 9 km of sandy beach were added from Bedok to the tip of Tanjong Rhu. With the loss of the sea frontage, the park decreased in popularity, although it was still a pleasant place to hang out. Eventually, the construction of the East Coast Parkway (ECP) expressway and extension of Fort Road to the Tanjong Rhu Flyover led to the demolition of the many of the structures in the park. While the park is still functioning, many of the events and activities that took place during its heyday are no longer there and the crowd has since moved on to other parks. On 3 November 1998, Katong Park was designated as a historic site.  Modern day  Currently, Katong Park is a neighborhood park under the care of NParks, with a playground and dog run area serving nearby residents. Although the old buildings from the seaside days are now gone, the main pedestrian paths that run through the park still remain. Heritage boards depicting the history of site from the colonial era all the way to the modern day have been set up.  Excavation of fort  In 2004, the park received public attention as a team of archaeologists began excavation of the buried fort. The Mountbatten Citizens' Consultative Committee garnered support from local residents and schools to encourage ownership of local heritage. Funding for the excavation was raised from corporate sponsors and a fund-raising dinner, totalling to S$200,000. Volunteer diggers found large portions of the fort still in situ, with portions that did not appear in the original plans. Over the 10 month dig, more than 1,000 volunteers from all walks of life assisted the archaeologists in their efforts. A public exhibition featuring 10 student design schemes by architecture students from NUS was held on 8 January 2006, showcasing concepts and ideas for an interpretative and information center to promote discussion on what the future of Katong Park could be. Despite their efforts in fund raising and excavating the fort, the dig was called off in 2005 and the remains were reburied to protect the remains from the elements as well as to prevent visitors from falling into the holes. Funding for the dig was diverted to bursaries and scholarships for students in the constituency. Only a bastion of the fort remains exposed and cordoned off, with no immediate plans for what to do with it. The fort is still pending acceptance as a National Monument by the Preservation of Monuments Board and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.  Sculptures  Sculptures depicting the British and Indian Sikh guard stand in the park and were donated by Mr Jack Sim. They represent the multi-ethnic civil defence forces of Singapore in the 19th century.  Katong Park MRT station  Katong Park MRT station (TE24), a station along the Thomson‚ÄìEast Coast line, is currently under construction and slated for completion in 2023. Proposals to integrate the fort and the MRT station were not undertaken and it is likely that the fort will remain untouched at least until the construction of the station is finished.

It was the first romance book store opened in the northern hemisphere.  About  The store was established by Bea and Leah Koch. The sisters began a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, eventually raising the $90,000 needed to open The Ripped Bodice. Books sold in The Ripped Bodice span a variety of sub-genres within romance and erotica including historical, contemporary, paranormal, sci-fi, LGBTQ, and multi-lingual. The books are arranged according to these topics, rather than organizing by title or author's last name. The Ripped Bodice hosts events in their physical store, including author signings, romantic comedy nights, book clubs and general literary events. They also arrange online book discussions. Their annual book club event The Great Big Romance Read, has nationwide participation and has financially benefited books chosen to be discussed because of the widespread nature of the event. In September 2018, the Koch sisters signed a contract with Sony Pictures Television to develop romance television projects.  Diversity in Romance  Starting the year the store opened in 2016, the Koch sisters began releasing an annual report titled The State of Racial Diversity in Romance Publishing. This annual review displays the percentages of authors of color (AOCs) being published by the top romance publishing companies including Harlequin, Kensington, Avon Romance, Entangled, and Crimson Romance. Repeatedly, the study has revealed a disconnect between the small percentage of AOCs published, and the percentage of The Ripped Bodice's best selling titles written by AOCs. Over the four years the study has been conducted, the percentage of published works by authors of color has increased by less than one percent.  Romance Awards  In February 2020, the Ripped Bodice announced the first winners of their newly established awards for romance. The contest is titled The Ripped Bodice's Awards for Excellence in Romance Fiction and acknowledges the chosen best romance titles for 2019. Twelve books were honored, chosen by experts associate with the genre, and the winners each receive $1,000.

Henry Rothschild (April 6, 1835 ‚Äì May 16, 1911) was an American businessman. Biography Victor Henry Rothschild was one of seven children born to a Jewish family on April 6, 1835 in Nordstetten, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany. His father owned a small retail store. In 1852, he immigrated to the United States settling in Oakland, California. He started as a travelling optical goods salesman using a wagon as a store which soon morphed into a general goods distributor to both individuals and small stores. In 1854, at the invitation of his brother-in-law, he moved to Mount Carroll, Illinois where they opened a retail store in Rothschild's name all the while he kept his distribution business operating. His ventures were successful and his brother Marx emigrated from Germany to join the business. The Panic of 1857 resulted in the failure of their business and the brothers moved first to Macon, Georgia and then to Hawkinsville, Georgia where they opened a small retail store. The advent of the American Civil War required that he shutter his business and he moved to New York City while his brother returned to Germany to care for their ailing father. He used his savings to settle some $38,000 in debt in his name that was incurred by his brother-in-law. Once settled, he was able to start a new business manufacturing n√©glig√©e shirts then a new trend. His brother returned from Germany and the business - known as Rothschild Brothers - expanded greatly. The company was renamed Rothschild Brothers & Gutman after they took Simeon Gutman as a partner; in 1877, the partnership was dissolved and the business continued operating as V. Henry Rothschild until in 1880, the name changed to V. Henry Rothschild & Co with Isaac Dreyfus as a partner. The company grew to over 7,000 employees with factories in New York and New Jersey. Personal life In 1872, he married Josephine Wolfe, daughter of Jacob Wolfe. They had five children: Irene M. Rothschild (1868‚Äì1954), Victor Sydney Rothschild, Gertrude Rothschild, Constance Lily Rothschild, and Clarence G. Rothschild. His daughter Irene was married to Solomon R. Guggenheim; his daughter Constance was married to Ira Nelson Morris; and his son, Victor Sydney was married to Lily Sulzberger.

The killing sparked three days of riots in Omaha's Northeast neighborhood. Shooting On June 24, 1969, teenagers gathered for a party at a vacant apartment in the Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects. The teenagers were playing music and dancing. When two police officers arrived, having been called on suspicion of a robbery, the teenagers fled out of the back door. The white police officer, James Loder, shot into the fleeing crowd without warning and Vivian Strong, a 14-year old African-American girl, was struck in the back of the head and was killed. Loder's partner was a Black officer, James W. Smith; he and Vivian's sister, Carol, asked Loder, \\"Why did you shoot her?\\" He did not reply. Unrest and riots followed for three days in Omaha's Northeast neighborhood, resulting in 21 arrests, 88 injuries, and $750,000 in property damage. Black Panthers, armed with weapons, protected black churches and the local black newspaper, the Omaha Star, during the riots. Aftermath One of Vivian's younger sisters, Carol, was with her when she was killed; she did not receive any counseling afterward, her mother had a nervous breakdown, and Carol subsequently took over the care of her younger brothers and sisters. The summer of Strong's death, the Black Panther Party (BPP) started the Vivian Strong Memorial Liberation School. The BPP established Liberation Schools in several US cities. The school in Omaha may have operated for only a week before it closed down. Initially, Police Chief Richard R. Anderson said James Loder, the police officer who killed Vivian Strong, would be suspended for 15 days and then fired. Loder was released from jail on a $500 bond. On March 17, 1970, an all-white jury of six men and six women acquitted James Loder of manslaughter. Of the acquittal, Vivian's mother said, \\"He did wrong. They (the jury) did wrong...If it would have been a white girl shot by a black policeman, he'd be serving time right now\\" . Loder returned to the police force, where he served for two more years. He was the estranged biological son of Hollywood actress Hedy Lamarr, who had claimed him as her adopted son in 1941 in order to conceal his illegitimacy.  Vivian Strong  Vivian was 14 years old and under the care of her nineteen year old babysitter, Linda Bradley, at the time of the shooting. She attended Tech Jr. High in Omaha, Nebraska. She had seven siblings. In 1964 she had rheumatic fever which left her with a leaky aortic valve.  Theater  Two plays have been produced about Vivian Strong. Monica Bauer's 2019 play, Vivian's Music: 1969, imagines the last days of Vivian's life and won an award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The play was produced at several off-Broadway theaters in New York City. Christopher Maly's 2018 play, The Blues of Knowing Why, was a \\"community account\\" of Vivian's short life based on interviews with friends, family, media, and members of resistance organizations.. The play was produced in Omaha's Union for Contemporary Arts.

It featured interviews, album and live reviews and band journals. Online, it featured exclusive videos and audio, as well as video game reviews. It ceased publication in 2013. About AMP was published monthly by American Music Press, with a print run of 80,000 copies. It focused primarily on punk, hardcore and metal music. Some of the prominent editors were Lucas Andrews, John Joh, Johnathan Marshall, Lisa Root, Jake Round, Tony Shrum, Sean Stepp, Chris Taravella and Nick White. History Matthews' beginning in music journalism started in 1996, with a fanzine he wrote titled Hit List. It lasted three years. AMP, and a sister publication Hails & Horns came together, circa 2000. AMP broadened focus from the underground music scene, which allowed for coverage of bands not featured in its contemporaries Maximumrocknroll and Alternative Press. He notes in an interview with Metro Post-Telegraph, that eventually \\"AMP started getting out of its sector and started getting too big.\\" In 2012, NOFX lead vocalist and bassist Fat Mike funded the magazine.

It is the successor of the Goliath GD750 and the last German built three-wheeler truck. Only 9,904 vehicles of this model were produced.  Technology  With its three wheels and a water-cooled two-cylinder two-stroke engine, the Goliath Goli continued a design principle that had long been a thing of the past for other vehicle manufacturers. Decisive for the use of only three wheels was the vehicle's approximately 30% lower production price. The Goliath Goli incorporated a sophisticated design. The engine was mounted behind the front wheel and provided a low centre of gravity, and the 6.40√ó13 tires ensured an optimum of stability and drive safety for a freight tricycle. Initially, an air-cooled engine rated 12.5 kW was used, but it had thermal problems. From 1957, a different 465 cm¬≥ engine with water-cooling was used. The power of this engine was 11 kW. It was deemed too weak for a 0.75 t freight vehcle. Maximum torque was only 34 N¬∑m at 2500 rpm. At full load, the vehicle had a power-to-weight ratio of 160 kg/kW. To avoid further bad criticism, Goliath offered replacing the air-cooled engine with a passively thermosiphon-cooled one for free. The Goli had a U-profile ladderframe, a control arm with a quarter elliptical spring for its front wheel, a solid rear axle with progressive leaf springs, a worm drive steering system, a hydraulic three wheel braking system, a parking brake for the rear wheels, and an all-steel cab. The 6 volts electric starter did not have a magnetic switch, instead, it was manually connected to the engine using a hand lever. The Goli's top speed was 60 km/h (37 mph). Fuel consumption was 7.5 l/100 km (31 mpg). Climb rate limit at full load was 23, 12, 7, 3% (depending on the gear). The turning radius is 11 m (36 ft).  Variants  The flatbed version was available in a low and a high variant. The lower variant offered a capacity of 6 m¬≥ (211 cft). There was also the full- metal panel van and separated freight box body variant. The vehicles external dimensions of the freight box variant were 2200 √ó 1460 √ó 1230 mm (68 √ó 58 √ó 9 inch). Depending on body and tires, the payload was 0.75 to 0.95 t (1653 to 2094 lb).(German) Aus dem internationalen Kraftfahrzeugbau ‚Äì Goliath-Dreirad- Kleinlaster mit Zweitaktmotor., Kraftfahrzeugtechnik, July 1959, p.289 Goli_Cockpit.JPG|Dashboard of the Goli Goli2-Bj1959,500 ccm,15 PS- Foto2005-08-26.jpg|Goli with panel van body Goliath Goli (2014-08-29 6578) Radaufh√§ngung.jpg|Wheel suspension and steering  References   External links  * List of remaining Goliath vehicles, retrieved February 2019 Category:Three-wheeled motor vehicles Category:Pickup trucks Category:Goliath vehicles Category:Vehicles of Germany Category:Vehicles introduced in 1955 Category:Pages with unreviewed translations ","title":"Goliath Goli"},{"id":"60108291","text":"Alan Warren Friedman is Thaman Professor of English and Comparative Literature in the department of English at the University of Texas at Austin.

The union was founded on 19 October 1835 in Manchester as the Bookbinders' Consolidated Relief Fund, with the principle aim of funding journeymen bookbinders to travel to other cities to find work, although it did also hope to improve the working conditions of bookbinders. It brought together local organisations around the UK, but it did not include the larger unions based in London and Edinburgh. Individuals could also join the union, but had to pay one guinea as an entrance fee. In June 1836, the first chief secretary of the union, James Winkworth, claimed to have lost money provided to him to pay a printers' bill. The union's central committee believed that he had embezzled the money, and removed him from office. Four years later, Thomas Dunning persuaded the union to reorganise as the Bookbinders' Consolidated Union, a more centralised body, while he merged the various London unions to form the London Consolidated Lodge of Journeymen Bookbinders. The plan was for the London union to merge into the national union, and take over its leadership, but it was found to be in a weak financial position, and the national union decided to remain separate. The national union itself began struggling, and nearly collapsed in 1842, leading the headquarters of the union to move to the stronger branch in Dublin the following year. Henry Searson became the chief secretary of the union in 1843, but after his wife died, he struggled to keep up with the work, and in 1847 a vote moved the headquarters of the union again, on this occasion to Liverpool. The union had grown significantly to 39 branches, and in 1854 an unemployment benefit for members was introduced. By 1855, the Liverpool branch was itself suffering from internal disputes, and the headquarters of the union were moved to Oxford. The union opened its first branch in London in 1857, directly competing with the London Consolidated Lodge. The headquarters moved to Manchester in 1858, by which time finances were again weak, as the unemployment benefit had been unexpectedly costly. In 1872, the union was renamed as the Bookbinders' and Machine Rulers' Consolidated Union, recognising a significant section of its membership. On 1 September, the Edinburgh Union Society of Journeymen Bookbinders, which had been involved in an unsuccessful strike, finally merged into the union. The rest of the decade was a difficult period, and in 1881 it was discovered that during it, secretary Richard Ballard had embezzled ¬£202. He was able to avoid prosecution by refunding the money, but in light of this, the union headquarters were once again moved to Liverpool, and a new rule was introduced that no city could host the seat of the union for more than six years in a row. This led it to move to Glasgow in 1888, at which time it was found that the previous secretary, Daniel Hughes, had embezzled ¬£211. In 1894, the headquarters moved to Bradford, which persuaded members to appoint a full-time chief secretary, this post going to the previous part-time holder, David Sharpe, who accordingly relocated to Bradford. The union affiliated to the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, and in 1899 its headquarters returned to Manchester, then in 1905 to Sheffield. The union established a general council for the first time in 1900, and this decided to affiliate to the Labour Representation Committee.

He also appeared with circuses in other American cities. In 1840, William Evans Burton leased the new National Theatre in Philadelphia, and Foster assisted in the stage production of a drama called The Naiad Queen (with Charlotte Cushman playing the queen) arranging the scenes and special effects. The National Theatre also produced a number of Foster's own creations, including two where he played the role of Napoleon. In 1841, he moved to the Walnut Street Theatre.

Adopted in 1920, it's composed of a circle in blue with an inscribed silver star. The circumference is surrounded on both sides by two olive branches in the shape of a crown, linked at the bottom by a ribbon of gules. Under the ribbon is the slogan \\"Por Guayaquil independiente\\" (For independent Guayaquil). It usually appears with an oval border in blue, although this is not an official version. Colonial coat of arms Colonial coat of arms of Guayaquil In colonial times, when the city was under the rule of Spain, Captain Diego de Urbina, by his own invention, designed a coat of arms for the city of Guayaquil, in which he tried to establish bonds of brotherhood between his hometown and his lineage in the same coat of arms in order to perpetuate the memory of his memorable feat, having rebuilt the city in 1541 and achieving the definitive consolidation of it. This shield is very similar to its similar arms of the Spanish city of Ordu√±a, where Urbina was a native. In 1952, the Ecuadorian historian and genealogist Pedro Robles Chambers obtained the exact reconstruction of the colonial coat of arms of Guayaquil, thanks to the successful works that J. Gabriel Pino Roca had previously carried out, as well as a set of unpublished documents that Pedro Jos√© Huerta provided him. The same year, the Historical Research Center of Guayaquil published his work entitled Study on the Origin of the Colonial Coat of Arms of the City of Santiago de Guayaquil in which said: The coat of arms of the city of Guayaquil, the result of Urbina's inspiration, would be heraldically described as follows: Coat of arms of the province of Guayas Other more modern and rhetorically adequate descriptions say that it is conformed by a blazon of Spanish type in field of azure, on water waves of azure and silver, open castle open gold, mauled in saber , crenelated by three battlements, donjoned and rinse of azure, lion crowned with gules holding the flag of the Spanish Empire. Bordure of gules loaded with gold chains, placed in a border, with elongated links. The city of Guayaquil and its province used this emblem until the declaration of independence of the city on October 9, 1820. At present, this emblem is part of the coat of arms of the province of Guayas. Meaning of the colonial coat of arms The objective elements or entities are: * The castle or tower, or part of the wall or battlements, represents being won, defended by strength of personal virtue or power. * The lion means braveness and courage. * The Flags and Banners represent the state of the rich man, leader of people of war, as well as flags and banners were won to their enemies. * The saltire was won by arms in the victory won against the Moors who were in the city of Baeza, the day of the Apostle Saint Andrew. The cross is the symbol of this saint who holds the tool of his martyrdom. This victory took place in the year 1227 and those who were there put it on their shields. * The waves, which also symbolize the waters of the Guayas River and the Gulf of Guayaquil, represent contrasts suffered with value and maturity. * The chains remember the episodes of the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, a symbol taken by several knights who showed off their courage there. The emblazoned form is currently associated with the eight borders of the coat of arms of Navarre. The symbolism of the colors used in the shield are the following: * Red or Gules means fire, daring, tricks, strength, war and blood expiration. * Blue or Azur denotes zeal, justice, charity and loyalty to the crown. With respect to the metals that are: * Gold means power, perseverance, wisdom and nobility. * Silver, symbolized by leaving the field blank and without a sign, represents innocence, integrity, wealth and expiration. The current coat of arms Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Olmedo, as President of the Superior Government Board of the Free Province of Guayaquil in November 1820, ordered that the official papers of the Cabildo bear the seal of a 5-pointed star, with a crown of laurels, a red bow and to one side the legend \\"Por Guayaquil independiente\\" (For independent Guayaquil). It became official symbol of the city in November 1920. Meaning of the current coat of arms * The light blue color of the circumference represents values associated with the city of Guayaquil, such as justice, loyalty, charity, honesty and bravery. * The red color in the bow represents courage, daring, the strength of the people, the war that gave independence to the city and the blood shed during this war. * The inscription \\"Por Guayaquil Independiente\\" (For independent Guayaquil) commemorates the struggle for the independence of the city, proclaimed on October 9, 1820. * The star in the center of the coat of arms is an element taken from the flag of the city. * The olive leaves represent the prosperity of the city, the richness of its fields and the fertility of the lands. Also, these branches symbolize peace and victory.
