History  In May 1850, Charles Partington purchased land in Symonds Street for ¬£200, and commenced the construction of ‚Äúthe new Windmill‚Äù at a cost of ¬£2000. In August 1851 the first flour was advertised for sale. Partington, an immigrant from Oxfordshire in England, had arrived in 1847. He had previously been in partnership with John Bycroft and together they took over the Epsom Mill that stood in St Andrews Road (part of which has been renamed Windmill Road in memory of that structure which was demolished in the 1920s). The partnership lasted until December 1849. The Symonds Street windmill was built in 1850 using bricks made on the site from clay dug nearby. In 1856 an important sideline was introduced - the baking of biscuits - using equipment specially imported from Reading, Berkshire in the United Kingdom, presumably from Huntley & Palmer's who already baked biscuits there. The business was renamed the Victoria Flour Mills and Steam Biscuit Factory. During the New Zealand wars (1861 to 1866), four firearms were always kept in the mill which was located in a strategic position on the southern edge of the Town of Auckland. As it happened Auckland was never directly threatened by the MƒÅori at any time during the conflict. During the wars, Charles Partington served with the British cavalry and the mill supplied the troops with food, chiefly biscuits, but also flour and crushed corn. By 1873 the biscuit making machinery had been relocated to the Riverhead mill and at least some of the land around the Symonds Street mill had been sold off as building sites. Shops were erected along Symonds Street and houses on the other three boundary roads leaving the windmill in the centre of the block accessed by a lane called at various times Mill lane or Partington street. Charles Partington died in 1877, apparently leaving his family affairs in disarray. His sons continued in the business and Joseph Partington took over the Symonds Street mill. In 1892 there was a Supreme Court Hearing, and a Mr Evans received title over part of the land, probably through mortgage default. In June 1895, Joseph Partington took out a 10-year lease from Evans. Two years later Evans sold his property to James Wilkinson who served Partington with notice to quit. What followed was a series of public arguments, including the publication of a libellous pamphlet by Partington and his being declared bankrupt again. Wilkinson apparently ran into financial trouble himself as he obliged to put the property up for sale in 1910. The successful buyer was, surprisingly, Joseph Partington, who purchased the property for ¬£400. Wilkinson was also in ill health, he died two years later. In 1911 Joseph travelled to England and there purchased a windmill and had the machinery, stones, cap and sails shipped back to Auckland, although it appears the sails were not fitted until around 1914. A gas engine was installed to supplement wind power but by 1916 it was found necessary to add 15 feet to the height of tower due to the increased height of the buildings now surrounding the mill. After a turbulent history of commercial ups-and-downs, family arguments and several fires, the mill's life was effectively ended in 1941 when the then owner, Joseph Partington, died leaving no will, although he had, on more than one occasion, made public announcements that he intended to leave the property to the City Council in order to preserve it. An early advocate of health food, Partington had recently been living the life of a recluse but had kept the mill working. Because of the City Council's decision not to press any legal claim or make a deal with the family the estate was eventually sold. Despite attempts by the Windmill Preservation Society to save the Windmill it was demolished in 1950. Although it had been promised that the 100,000 wedge shaped bricks were to be kept safe in order that the Windmill Tower could be recreated elsewhere, the bricks mysteriously vanished. Most of the machinery and other parts were destroyed; the metal turret cap was apparently melted down for scrap metal. There are Mill Stones at the Howick Historic Village and MOTAT which are labelled as coming from Partington's Windmill. In 1980 all the buildings on the block of land bounded by Symonds Street to the east, City Road to the north, Liverpool Street to the west and Karangahape Road to the south were razed. In the next six years five large buildings arose on the site. Most of the northern part of the site was devoted to the multi-story Sheraton Auckland Hotel & Towers, which incorporated a shopping arcade linking with Karangahape Road. This structure was rebranded on 1 January 2005 as the Langham Hotel, Auckland.Langham Hotel Melbourne on hotel.com.au  Present operation  In 1983 the final public reception for the Royal Tour took place here for Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales. In 1990 the Auckland Gay Mardi Gras Party was held in the Ballroom - the first such event in New Zealand. In 2001 the first Interpride Conference held in the Southern Hemisphere was opened by the Prime Minister Helen Clark.

He was sailing master of the flagships Mary Rose and Henry Grace a Dieu. He served as the first Master of Trinity House, the private corporation for maritime affairs in London. Spert Island off the coast of Antarctica is named for him. The Henry Grace a Dieu Early life and career Thomas Pert (as his name was at times recorded) or SpertPatrick J. Murphy, Ray W. Coye, Mutiny and Its Bounty: Leadership Lessons from the Age of Discovery, Yale University Press, 2013, p. 248 note 12. Quote: \\"Some contemporary sources use \\"Pert\\" for his name but most primary sources use \\"Spert\\". The ending of his given name, Thomas, may have been a phonetic factor in the use of the \\"s\\".\\" was born in England. He entered the service of Henry VII as a mariner, carrying dispatches between England and Spain. Spert served, evidently with credit, in the navy of Henry VIII during the Anglo- French War of 1512-14. In 1512-15 he was master of the Mary Rose, one of the most important warships in the Crown's fleet. On 10 November 1514, Spert was granted an annuity of ¬£20, which was confirmed in January 1516. He next was assigned as master to the Henry Grace a Dieu, the largest vessel constructed up to then in England. On 10 July 1517, Spert was granted the office of ballasting ships in the Thames River, which office he was to hold 'during pleasure' at a fee of ¬£10 a year. Historian James A. Williamson in his work of 1913 thought this fact aided an argument against Richard Eden's statement that Spert's misconduct had spoiled the success of the 1516-1517 voyage of discovery undertaken with Sebastian Cabot. Williamson said that the ballasting office apparently provided opportunity for profit, and would not have been granted to a man who had recently disgraced himself. A document in the Public Record Office is found in a manuscript book showing the issues of various stores to the masters of the king's ships. Entries detail Spert's presence on the Henry Grace a Dieu on 7 April and 5 July 1516, and on 28 April and 17 September 1517. Together with the grant made to him on 10 July 1517, Williamson argued that these appear to be conclusive evidence that Spert was not traveling with Sebastian Cabot in a voyage of discovery in 1516-1517 to the southern coast of North America.James A. Williamson, Maritime Enterprise 1485-1558, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1913, pp. 241-245 What is known of the remainder of Spert's career shows that he continued in high favour with the king. He served in the war of 1522-5 and was consulted by the admiral as to the best way of cutting out some Scottish privateers in Boulogne harbour. His knighthood has been disputed by historians, but Williamson notes two official documents that refer to him as Sir Thomas Spert (Letters and Papers, vi, No. 196 ; xvii, No. 1258).Williamson (1913), Maritime Enterprise, p. 244 Spert made his will 28 November 1541, naming his wife Mary (Fabian) as executrix, and died at Stepney in December. According to Baldwin, his monument at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, is in error in stating that he died on 8 September 1541. He left his pasturage in Blackwall to his widow until his son Richard reached the age of majority. He also made bequests to his daughter and to his cousin Margaret Spert, who was married to 'the famous Guinea seaman, John Lok'. Marriages and issue Spert married a woman named Margery, whose surname is unknown. He married as his second wife Anne Salkell, but appears to have had no children by either marriage. He married thirdly Mary Fabian, the daughter of John Fabian (nephew of the chronicler, Robert Fabyan) and Anne Waldegrave. They had two children. Their son Richard Spert married Grissell Salkell of King's Wood, Wiltshire. Their daughter Anne Spert married firstly Thomas Brook, and secondly John Skott. Legacy and honors Spert Island off the coast of Antarctica is named for him. Notes References Sir Thomas Spert - People and places, Port Cities *James A.

The author of few lyrical works, he was foremost noted for his association with political and intellectual figures such as Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, Costache Negruzzi, Vasile C√¢rlova, and Grigore Crupenschi.  Biography  Born in Ia≈üi, Hrisoverghi was a member of the boyar category: the second of Vornic Neculai Hrisoverghi's four sons, he traced his origin to Greek Phanariotes who were present in Moldavia during the rule of Prince Dimitrie Cantemir.Faifer; KogƒÉlniceanu His mother was Elena Ruset, a member of the Rosetti family.Faifer According to his friend and biographer Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, \\"Hrisoverghi took absolutely no pride in this vain noble origin; he had sufficient personal merit, without needing any more from his parents\\".KogƒÉlniceanu Neculai Hrisoverghi died in 1818. Alexandru Hrisoverghi's childhood and youth coincided with the Greek War of Independence, during which the Filiki Eteria troops of Alexander Ypsilantis occupied Moldavia and Wallachia; the Hrisoverghis took refuge in Imperial Russian-ruled Bessarabia. It was in Chi≈üinƒÉu that he began his studies, being tutored in Ancient Greek by a teacher named Constantin, before returning to his native city in 1824. After attending the Orthodox school in Ia≈üi, he enrolled in a French-language boarding school headed by a professor Mouton, while being tutored in Ancient Greek literature by a Greek teacher named Franguli. According to KogƒÉlniceanu: \\"His education was superficial; but this was no fault of his, rather that of a lack in educational institutions that was being experienced in Moldavia at the time\\". As a consequence of the Russo- Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829, Moldavia and Wallachia were occupied by Russia, and, soon after, became subject to the Regulamentul Organic regime. This notably provided for the creation of a Moldavian Militia force, which young people of the principality joined in large numbers after 1830. Hrisoverghi was one of them, but withdrew in 1832, after just two years of service--dissatisfied with military life, he was also the sole provider for his family after two of his brothers had died. At the time, he became an avid reader of Andr√© Ch√©nier and other French Romantics, while leading a Bohemian lifestyle and becoming noted for his affairs with women. Reportedly, he was a handsome person, and the object of compliments from women in high society. By that time, Hrisoverghi was showing the symptoms of an unknown disease, which first manifested itself as renal colics. As doctors recommended exercise and fresh air, he left for the Ottoman Empire, visiting Rumelia on his way to Edirne. In KogƒÉlniceanu's view: \\"The patriarchal life of the Bulgarians, their customs so unlike those of any other, more civilized and thus more commonplace, nations, the magnificent view of the Balkans still full of souvenirs from the Russian victories [in the war of 1828-1829], all that primitive nature left vivid imprints in his memory and awoke within him the poetic genius\\". Returning to Moldavia in 1834, Alexandru Hrisoverghi published his debut work, Ruinelor CetƒÉ≈£ii Neam≈£u or Oda ruinelor CetƒÉ≈£ii Neam≈£u, an ode which had been prompted by news that the inhabitants of T√¢rgu Neam≈£ were planning to raze the nearby medieval complex and use it as a source of building material (see Neam≈£ Fortress). Its final stanza began with the words: Ruinelor CetƒÉ≈£ii Neam≈£u had instant appeal, persuading Prince Mihail Sturdza to block the T√¢rgu Neam≈£ demolition projects, as well as popularizing historic preservation throughout Moldavia. Over the following years, Hrisovergi pursued a romantic affair with Catinca Beldiman, the wife of Vornic Nicolae Dimachi (himself an amateur poet). According to KogƒÉlniceanu (who did not mention her name): \\"She was a young, beautiful woman, with a vivid imagination, who had kept alive all the illusions of her childhood and who, resonating with the young poet's fiery words, answered him: love me, be blessed; make yourself a luminous name among men, so you may cover me with your glory. Hrisoverghi found in her the ideal heroine he had previously read about in works by Byron, Dumas and those of so many novelists; he gained a soul to understand his own soul, a heart for his heart, a star for his horizon. He thus forgot everything else, glory, honors, future, in order to live for his loved one\\". KogƒÉlniceanu noted that all of Hrisoverghi's works after that moment, his poems as well as his translation of Dumas' Antony, evidenced the inspiration Hrisoverghi had received from the object of his affection. Antony was first published posthumously by the Bucharest printing press of Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu, and featured a preface by Costache Negruzzi. Also in 1834, Hrisoverghi welcomed the arrival of Prince Mihail Sturdza, through which the Ottoman Empire consecrated the end of Phanariote rules, and authored a poem in Sturdza's honor (Oda pentru venirea √Æ. s. domnului stƒÉp√¢nitor). After that moment, he also decided to regain the Militia (August 1834), serving as adjutant to the Hatman. In late December, Sturdza welcomed him on his personal staff, where he served as princely adjutant, being promoted Captain in January 1836. In February, after he was present at a masquerade ball in Ia≈üi, he left on mission to Pribe≈üti, traveling through a blizzard--this contributed to the subsequent decline of his health. Physicians recommended that he seek help from Austrian specialized doctors in Vienna, who ultimately directed him to the thermal baths in the Two Sicilies, at Ischia. This treatment failed to improve his condition, and, following his return to Moldavia, Hrisoverghi never left his bed. In constant pain for the following year, he died soon after turning 26, and was buried at the Sf√¢ntul Nicolae din Deal Church in Ia≈üi. His funeral was attended by a large group of officers and young civilians. The autopsy reportedly uncovered that Hrisoverghi died of complications from tabes dorsalis, which medicine of the time attributed to tuberculosis.CƒÉlinescu, p.73; Faifer; KogƒÉlniceanu In connection to his death, Gheorghe Sion later claimed that Hrisoverghi was severely injured after jumping from a window, when caught in his lover's arms by her husband; allegedly, his rival took him into his care.CƒÉlinescu, p.73 This account, which probably referred to Catinca Beldiman and her husband, was doubted by George CƒÉlinescu, who noted that it may have been entirely borrowed from Antony. A book of his collected works was published in 1843, and included his panegyrics to various potentates of his day. Most of his poems were left in unpolished stages, including one he composed on his deathbed:  Legacy  KogƒÉlniceanu, who defined Hrisoverghi's views as \\"liberal and in balance with the times\\", noted the influence exercised by Andr√© Ch√©nier on his style, and drew parallels between the two authors' lives (including their ambivalent attitudes toward military life). In addition, he credited the writer with having introduced a national focus in Moldavian literature, which, he claimed, lagged behind that of Wallachia in this respect (while acknowledging that Hrisoverghi's poems would occasionally rank below modern standards). The poet Vasile Alecsandri, whose career began soon after Hrisoverghi died, looked back on the period in an introduction to writings by his friend Negruzzi: \\"The development of ideas and the purifying of literary taste were very bitterly made aware of the government's oppressive system, and the impetus of writers broke off its wings, crashing into public indifference like one would into a rock. Old people would only read the lives of the saints; and youngsters would read nothing at all, holding Romanian books in contempt, and among those youngsters only an Alexandru Hrisoverghi and a Costache Negruzzi: rari nantes in gurgite vasto would tap their foreheads, saying, like Ch√©nier in the hour of his death: Et pourtant je sens que j'ai quelque chose l√† [\\"And yet I feel that have something here\\"]!\\".Alecsandri In later periods, literary critics took more reserved stands in respect to Hrisoverghi's contribution to Romanian literature. During the interwar period, Paul Zarifopol expressed disapproval of Hrisoverghi and many of his contemporaries (including IenƒÉchi≈£ƒÉ and Iancu VƒÉcƒÉrescu, Vasile C√¢rlova, Gheorghe Asachi and Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu).Zarifopol While commending KogƒÉlniceanu for establishing an influential school of literary criticism, he noted that the emphasis he had placed on \\"national specificity\\" had led him to overestimate the value of poets such as Hrisoverghi. Writing a decade later, George CƒÉlinescu noted that Ruinelor CetƒÉ≈£ii Neam≈£u was \\"a disgraceful replica of C√¢rlova's Ruinurile T√¢rgovi≈ütii\\". He also stressed the misogyny present in several lyrics authored by Hrisoverghi, which he defined as \\"[having] the stray impulses of Romantic jokes and featuring ridiculous invectives\\".CƒÉlinescu, p.74 In respect to this, he cited the stanza: Besides his translation of Dumas' novel, Alexandru Hrisoverghi is noted for those of poems by Ch√©nier (to which he notably added his own verses), Friedrich Schiller (probably, through a French-language translation), Alphonse de Lamartine, and Victor Hugo. He is the main character in a 1943 novel by Theodor R√¢≈ücanu (FermecƒÉtorul Hrisoverghi).

The team is composed of college baseball players from teams around the U.S. In recent years, the Bells have produced a number of Major League players including Marc Rzepczynski of the 2011 World Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals, Jeff Francis of the 2007 National League Champion Colorado Rockies, Adrian Sampson (Texas Rangers), Spencer Howard (Philadelphia Phillies) and Whatcom County natives Ty Taubenheim (Toronto Blue Jays), Kevin Richardson (Texas Rangers). Bellingham also rostered former Tennessee Titans quarterback Jake Locker while he was playing football at the University of Washington. History 2020 The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team plans to compete in the 2021 WCL season, which will begin in June 2021.  2019  The 2019 season proved to be an up and down campaign for the team. The Bells came within one game of winning the first half WCL north crown to put them in the playoffs, losing a heartbreaker to WCL North champion Victoria in the final game of the first half. The team's first half performance produced 5 all stars with Guthrie Morrison OF (Gonzaga), Jack Machtolf OF (Gonzaga), Troy Viola 3B (San Jose St), Jimmy Chatfield RP (Yale), and Nick Proctor SP (Cal - Berkeley) all representing the squad. Troy was also invited to participate in the home run derby and ended up leading the team with 8 homers on the year. The second half saw many new faces on a Bells squad that fought hard, but in the end was not able to make the WCL playoffs. Nick Proctor was a member the All WCL first team, while Jimmy Chatfield was named to the All WCL second team. The community in Bellingham rallied around the Bells, packing Joe Martin with 50,344 fans in 28 games for an average of almost 1,800 fans a game.  2018  The Bells dominated the WCL north in 2018 going 35-19 and winning both the first and second half titles for their division. The Bells had many stand out performers on their squad, including Matt McLain (UCLA) who was named the WCL top prospect as an incoming freshman. The Bells were well represented in the WCL All Star Game with Justin Armbruester (PLU) being the winning pitcher, Taylor Davis (Gonzaga), Bellingham local Ernie Yake (Gonzaga), and team homerun leader Matt James (Notre Dame) all representing the team. The team also boasted 3 1st team (Ernie Yake SS, Nick Nastrini SP (UCLA), and Theron Kay RP (Cal-State Northridge)), and 3 2nd team All WCL players (Zach Needham 1B (Lewis-Clark State), Taylor Davis RP, and Justin Armbruester SP). The first round of the playoffs featured a matchup between the Bells and the Kelowna Falcons, where the Bells were defeated in the deciding third game of the series. There was a large spike in attendance as the Bells saw a rise in popularity in 2018, with 51,635 fans making it to 35 for an average crowd of 1,475, good for third in the WCL.  2017  Despite falling one game short of the playoffs in 2017 after going 31-23 on the season, the fight for the post season provided a variety of very dramatic endings. Kyle Stowers (Stanford) provided two occasions where he was responsible for the walk-off hit to win the game. A non-league game ended in a Home Run Derby tie-breaker after extra innings, including an exciting finish and game-winning dinger by Chase Illig (West Virginia). Illig also was awarded Player of the Week mid-season, set the record for most home runs during the WCL season at 15 and was awarded WCL Player of the Year Honors. Hometown kid, and 2019 5th round draft pick Austin Shenton, was the WCL Batting Champ, finishing the season with a .409 batting average. The attendance at Bells games also grew in 2017, finishing third in overall attendance, 36,569, which averages to 1,407 fans per game.  2016  The Bells made it back to the WCL Championship Series after going 32-22 in the regular season. The North Division Champs faced the Corvallis Knights of the South Division for the title in a hard-fought three-game series. Even though the Knights ended up winning the title (2 games to 1), the Bells still had a very successful season overall. Shane Hanon (Marshall University) was crowned WCL Batting Champ, finishing the season with a .331 batting average. The Bells also had one of their standout pitchers from the 2015 and 2016 season, Spencer Howard, drafted 45th overall in the 2016 MLB Draft to the Philadelphia Phillies and is #20 on their Top 30 prospect list.  2015  Following the WCL Championship Season, the Bells were looking to defend their title. Though they went 33-21 on the season, they were unable to make it back to the playoffs. The highlight of the season though was the 2015 WCL All-Star Game, hosted by the Bells at Joe Martin Field. The Bells were able to represent themselves at the game by having six players in the All-Star Game. These players include Justin Calomeni (now with the Colorado Rockies organization), Andrew Kemmerer, Bronson Larsen, Andrew Reichenbach, Dustin Breshears, and Aaron Stroosma. The Bells finished the 2015 season fourth in attendance, with 34,435 attendees to Joe Martin Field.  2014  The Bellingham Bells became the 4th team in WCL history to win a championship, going 37-17 for the season. David Bigelow set a WCL record for most games played, with 29 games in the season. As a whole team, the Bells had 20 saves on the season setting the record for the most saves by any team in WCL history. Their 0.202 opponents' batting average as a team tied the record set by the 2005 Aloha Knights. Bellingham saw 47,307 fans in the seats at Joe Martin Field in just 32 home games, with an average of 1,478 people per night.

He founded the Fourth Presbyterian Church, Albany, New York, following a schism at the Second Presbyterian Church in the same city, and later served as the first pastor of Mount Vernon Congregational Church (now associated with Old South Church) in Boston, from 1842 to 1871, where his teaching led to the conversion of renowned evangelist Dwight L. Moody. Life Kirk was educated at Princeton Theological Seminary under Dr. Archibald Alexander, and after graduating worked as an agent for the Board of Foreign Missions. In 1824, he helped to create the Chi Phi Society, a semi-religious, semi-literary organization, which ceased activity the following year when it merged with the Philadelphian Society. In 1827 he was appointed assistant pastor of the Second Presbyterian church in Albany, New York, where William Sprague later ministered, and in 1828 he organized the Fourth Presbyterian church in Albany, after controversy at Second church resulted in a church division partly due to the revivalism techniques then being popularized by Charles Grandison Finney. With Dr. Nathan S.S. Beman of Troy, New York, Kirk established a training school which taught theology for aspiring evangelists. After a time preaching in London and Paris, Kirk returned to the United States and took up the pastorate at Mount Vernon which he held for nearly 30 years. He was invited by the American Foreign Christian Union to \\"proceed to Paris for five months as a special commissioner to attend to the establishment of an American congregation and house of worship\\" in that city. Dr. Kirk sailed on the steamer \\"Asia\\" arriving in Paris February 6, 1857 and during his time there until September was able to secure the charter for the American Church in Paris from Napoleon III and secured the purchase of the first building of the American Church in Paris located at 21 rue de Berri. He returned to Boston in September 1857. Although the American Foreign Christian Union urged him to consider the acceptance of the post of Chaplain to the infant church, he felt the claims of his church in Boston were pressing. He remained with the Mount Vernon congregation until his death, March 27, 1874 in Boston.

The Battle of Freiberg was fought on 29 October 1762 and was the last great battle of the Third Silesian War (and of the wider Seven Years' War). Background Prince Henry of Prussia, younger brother of King Frederick II of Prussia, although commanding an army made up mostly of 'second line' troops and free- battalions, decided to take the offensive against the Reichsarmy commanded by Prince Stolberg who had the support of Andr√°s Hadik's Austrian Corps. The Allies were dug in behind field works situated on top of high ground to the west of the town of Freiberg. This position blocked all approaches to Dresden. To the rear of the allied position was the River Mulde, which was crossed by several bridges to the east of the town. On 28 October Prince Henry and his staff performed a reconnaissance of the allied position. This was hampered by the Austrian light troops who occupied the woods in front of the high ground. Henry gathered enough information however, to form a good picture of the enemy's dispositions. It was clear to Henry that the main Austrian force, the Corps under Campitelli, was securely ensconced on the heights to the south- west of the town, whilst the Reichsarmy held the heights blocking the western access to Freiberg. Although the front of their position had been strengthened by the construction of several redoubts and abbatis, no force appeared to be protecting the right flank of the allied army leaving the Reichsarmy troops somewhat 'out on a limb'. This was too tempting a target for the Prince, who planned to pin the Austrians to the south-west with a small detachment while his main army outflanked and defeated the lower quality Reichsarmy. Henry was gambling that the Austrian Corps under Meyer, comfortable behind their entrenchments, would not want to leave their lofty position. Battle At dawn on 29 October Prince Henry formed his army on the ground to the west of Lang Hennersdorf, detailing Forcade with the reserve to the north, Kleist to the south to pin Meyer, with Seydlitz and Stutterheim to attack the heights held by the Reichsarmy. As they advanced, the leading elements of the Prussian army skirmished briefly with the Croats in the woods but these troops soon withdrew in the face of formed infantry. Young Stutterheim's attack however, met stiff resistance from the corps of Campitelli and for a time the attack stalled. Several Prussian cavalry attacks also failed to shift the Austrians and a regiment had to be borrowed from the left wing in order to stabilise this front. While the main Prussian army attacked this position, Seydlitz, finding the ground difficult for his cavalry, took command of the infantry on his wing and attacked Campitelli's flank. With the pressure mounting, Stolberg began to move his line to the south in order to bolster the defence of a hillock known as the Trois Croix. Henry also recognised the importance of this feature and rushed his grenadiers towards it. The Imperial cavalry charged the Prussians, and although driven off with loss, bought enough time for the Reichsarmy grenadiers to take possession of the hill. Old Stutterheim, never one to stand idly by, noticed the shift of the Reichsarmy southwards and realised that the defenders to his front had become weakened by this move. He ordered his troops to attack without delay and the Austrian infantry began to crumble. The Prussian Belling Hussars and KR4 charged through the enemy infantry who broke and were cut down by the victorious Prussians. With his allies in retreat and his flanks wide open, Stolberg ordered a general retreat. The Reichsarmy withdrew from their positions followed by the remainder of Campitelli's troops. As predicted, Mayer's corps did not leave their positions to help the rest of their army, Meyer later protesting that he had stuck to his orders to hold his position to the last drop of blood. The Prussians lost 1400 men, the Allies lost 7000 men, 9 colours and 28 guns. Outcome The Allies retreated all the way back to Pirna, the Prussians following up cautiously at first and then more boldly. Kleist was detached during the first week in November in order to raid the Austrian magazines in Saxony, which he did, completely destroying them. He then took his footsore soldiers into Franconia under orders from Henry to upset the Imperialists. Naumberg, W√ºrzburg and Regensburg were taken and 'contributions' were extracted from the ruling Princes. Stolberg pleaded in vain with Hadik to be allowed to return and protect his homeland but unbeknown to him, Hadik had been in secret talks with King Frederick and they reached an agreement which led to the disbandment of the Reich's army.

She was responsible for removing mines from harbors, and, in her role as rescue and salvage ship, she was responsible for coming to the aid of stricken vessels. She was laid down 5 August 1918 by the Baltimore Drydock & Shipbuilding Co., Baltimore, Maryland; launched 7 June 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Fred A. Plagemann, wife of the prospective commanding officer; and commissioned 17 October 1919, Lt. F. A. Plagemann in command.  Post-World War I service  She operated out of New York City on various training missions until she decommissioned on 14 April 1922. Placed in service early in 1924, she steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, and was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard on 24 May. Commissioned on 11 October as USCGC Redwing, a cruising cutter, she operated out of New York City and Boston until 19 November 1928. In January 1929 she assumed permanent duty out of Astoria, Oregon. Except for various patrol assignments, Redwing remained at Astoria until 1941. Then returning to the east coast, she was transferred back to the U.S. Navy on 29 August, was redesignated ARS-4, and entered Brooklyn Navy Yard for conversion. Redwing recommissioned 28 October, Lt. (jg.) Martin C. Sibitsky in command. After shakedown, she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet on 20 November. Departing New York the same day, she arrived Argentia, Newfoundland, on 23 November; and from there steamed to Iceland, arriving 9 December.  World War II operations  Remaining in Icelandic waters through 9 August 1942, she performed towing and limited salvage services. She arrived New York 30 August and there engaged in salvage operations until October, when she underwent a short availability at Norfolk, Virginia. Redwing departed 6 November for Casablanca, arriving the 25th after a three-day stopover in Bermuda. She operated under the Casablanca Port Authority as the only salvage ship in the harbor until 5 May 1943. She next reported to Commander, Task Force 84, reached Algiers 19 June, towed a damaged merchant ship into port, and departed 27 June for Bizerte with four YTs in tow.  Sinking At 0605 29 June, when about from her destination, Redwing was rocked by an underwater explosion which tore a large hole in her hull just below the bridge. Five officers and eight enlisted men were blown overboard. She began to list dangerously and the order was given to abandon ship. The four tugboats received the crew and recovered two injured officers, two wounded enlisted men, and the body of one other enlisted man. Her decks awash, Redwing was taken in tow by the tugboats. At 1005 near the main channel leading into the harbor at Bizerte, a British destroyer passed close abeam and her wake caused Redwing to roll over. The towing hawsers were cut and she sank in of water. She was struck from the Navy list on 19 August 1943.

Designed to exploit new outrigger rotor technology, the helicopter was abandoned during construction. Design and development Based on the designs of American engineer Fred Landgraf who established the Landgraf Helicopter Corporation in the early years of the Second World War, The Firth Helicopter was more of a \\"proof-of-concept\\" aircraft than a true prototype. Firth Helicopters Ltd. had obtained rights to the Landgraf patents regarding a concept which involved twin outrigger pylons carrying three-bladed rotors fitted with ailerons to change direction. The design team of Heenan, Winn and Steele, led by Major J.N. Dundas Heenan who had been previously involved in a similarly unorthodox 1948 aircraft project, the Planet Satellite, utilized the fuselage of the second Satellite prototype, registered G-ALXP in 1951. The small, streamlined Satellite monocoque fuselage consisted of panels of an extremely light magnesium-zirconium alloy. The original contours tapered to a butterfly tail that was eliminated and replaced by a single fin to be topped by a tailplane in a \\"T tail\\" design; surprisingly, the Satellite fuselage was integrated seamlessly into the new helicopter planform.Middleton 1983, p. 531. The Satellite's four-seat configuration allowed for a larger helicopter than the Landgraf H-2/H-3 series (the H-4 would have been a 5/8 passenger helicopter) which had been the basis of the first Landgraf concept helicopters. The twin non-articulated type rotors were powered by two 145 hp de Havilland Gipsy Majors. Testing and evaluation In 1952, Firth Helicopters began the construction of the FH-01/4 (still registered as G-ALXP) at their Thame, UK facilities. Although the majority of the work had been completed, technical problems with excessive weight on the anterior part of the rotors seemed to be unsurmountable given the limited financial resources of the company. Gradually work ground to a halt without final equipment being installed and no hope for a first flight. The Firth FH-01/4 was presented to the College of Aeronautics at Cranfield in 1955.

The plot features a cavalry lieutenant, unlucky in love, who redeems himself by battling the \\"rebels\\" of Tripolitania (modern Libya). The film won the Mussolini Cup at the Venice Film Festival, during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. Plot Cristiana (Fulvia Lanzi) is seen enjoying herself, dancing and drinking with other men. Lieutenant Mario Ludovici (Antonio Centa) races down a dark road and calls Cristiana from a payphone with a sense of urgency. When she does not answer, he proceeds to her apartment and angrily pounds on the door and rings the bell. He demands a traditional relationship, and leaves when she refuses but tries to seduce him. Mario transfers to a desert fort in Tripolitania, where he replaces a heroic lieutenant who has recently perished in combat against the rebellious natives. Captain Santelia (Fosco Giachetti) distrusts Mario at first as a cowardly playboy. However, after the rebels steal some animals, the two pursue them with a squadron of camel-riding native troops allied to the Italians on a long and panoramic desert trek. Mario becomes ill, but eventually the two officers come to a mutual understanding and Mario disposes of a cigarette case from Cristiana and stops reminiscing of their luxurious memories. Having caught up to the rebels at an oasis, a battle ensues; the rebels are defeated but the captain is killed. Meanwhile, Cristiana and a group of other tourists have arrived at the fort. A reconnaissance plane brings news to the fort of the battle and a dead officer, without knowing which officer has perished. This causes Cristiana an anxious night of waiting. The following day Lieutenant Ludovici returns, now in command of the squadron, and elects to remain in Tripolitania. As Cristiana prepares to leave with the tourist group, Mario bids her a final goodbye.

The brown bear occurs in the region. Geography The Gramos is situated on the borders of the Kolonj√´ district of Albania and the Ioannina and Kastoria regional units of Greece. Three ridges join at its highest peak, running towards the north, southwest and east. The Gramos is drained towards the west by the river Osum, towards the northwest by the Devoll, towards the northeast by the Aliakmonas and towards the south by the Sarantaporos. The Gramos is very sparsely populated, the only sizable town being Ersek√´ (Albania) at its western foot. Other villages in the mountains are Gramos (northeast), Aetomilitsa (southeast), Starje (west) and Plikati (south). Nearby mountain ranges are the Smolikas to the south, Voio to the east and Ostrovic√´ to the northwest. History The mountain was a major communist stronghold in the Greek Civil War. Napalm B was also used during the Greek Civil War between the Greek Army and Communist rebels. During the last year of this Civil War, 1949, the United States increased its military aid to the Greek Government by introducing a new weapon to finish off the war: napalm B. (See also: greek fire) The first napalm attack in Greece took place on the mountain of Grammos, which was the stronghold of the Communist rebels. The provisional democratic government (i.e. the communist government) had its headquarters in the vicinity. It fell to the national government only in 1949, bringing the near conclusion of the Greek Civil war since after its fall only isolated pockets were left in communist control.

Mintoff was born on 21 August 1951, the daughter of the former Prime Minister of Malta, Dom Mintoff and Moyra De Vere Bentinck, by whom she is descended from both Dutch and British nobility.Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), Vol., p. 3183. Career As a teacher in the United Kingdom, Yana Mintoff was a member of the Socialist Workers Party. On 6 July 1978 Mintoff took part in a demonstration in the UK House of Commons; in a protest against the presence of UK troops in Northern Ireland, three bags of horse manure were hurled from the public gallery during a debate on Scottish devolution; John Mcsherry and Mintoff were arrested and she was later fined. On her return to Malta, she helped establish the Association of Women of the Mediterranean Region. Mintoff helped compile four books of collected works: *Militarism in the Mediterranean, Malta 1994 *Health in the Mediterranean, including interviews with Tuareg Nuclear test Victims, Malta 1995 *Nobody Can Imagine Our Longing: Refugees and Immigrants in the Mediterranean, Plain View Press, Austin TX 1996 *In Search of Peace, Plain View Press, 1998 An economist by training, her publications include an article published in the International Journal of Health Services, Johns Hopkins University, MD, USA. In Texas in 1998, Mintoff was a founder and superintendent of the Katherine Anne Porter School, a charter school in Wimberley. Having returned to Malta to tend to her ailing father, Mintoff addressed the Maltese Labour Party's General Conference of 2012. She was a candidate in the 2013 Maltese general election, but failed to get elected to the House of Representatives. Family Mintoff's first husband was Geoff Mainwaring. She married David P. Bland in 1991. Her children are Cetta S. Mainwaring and Daniel X. Mainwaring. After the couple separated, Mintoff formed a relationship with a younger man from Romania, Gheorghe Popa. On 24 October 2016, Popa became suspicious that she may have been dating another man, which led to a fight involving knives at the family residence in Tarxien. Her son, Daniel Mainwaring, intervened to stop the fight from escalating. As Mintoff and her son went to seek medical attention, Popa allegedly set the house on fire which lead to severe structural damage to the property. The 39-year-old Romanian was found in the vicinity after a man hunt, soaked in blood.

It is therefore a significant file format for the \\"print on demand\\" market sector, along with PostScript and PDF. RDO is a metafile format based on the Open Document Architecture (ODA) specifications: In Xerox's RDO implementation, description and control information is stored within the RDO file, while raster images are stored separately, usually in a separate folder, as TIFF files. The RDO file dictates which bitmap images will be used on each page of a document, and where they will be placed. Features and disadvantages This approach has advantages and disadvantages over the monolithic approach used by PDF: The disadvantages of RDO are that it is a largely proprietary format, and the multi-file approach means that file management and orphan control is more of an issue: one cannot tell from a computer's file system whether all the files required for a document to print are present and correct. In RDO's favor, the multi- file approach allows a networked device to load the small RDO file and then request the larger bitmap files only when necessary: This allows a full job specification to be loaded and installed over a network almost immediately, with the larger bitmap files only having to be transferred as and when needed, allowing more flexibility for managing network traffic loading. The TIFF file format is highly portable, and Xerox's MakeReady software, supplied with its XDOD systems, readily imports and export postscript files: however, the Xerox \\"on demand\\" systems typically require a document library to be stored as RDO / TIFF files, and most non-Xerox applications will not read RDO structures directly.

Several mines were developed, and ore was hauled in wagons to a mill at the mouth of the canyon. The town of Graham was founded in the mountains, and water was needed to operate the electric generators. It came from a pipeline reaching up into the canyon, and was held onto the rock walls of the canyon with timbers and iron bars that were in constant need of maintenance.

The 2018 lineup includes all three remaining original members: Dave Wanless (vocals), Andy Frank (guitar), Shawn Minden (bass) as well as new members Sean Williamson (guitar) and Dan Fila (drums). History Early days and Sven Gali: 1987-1993 Sven Gali played covers locally for several years. In 1989, shortly after changing their setlist to 20% covers and 80% originals, drummer Steve Macgregor left the band he named and formed and was replaced Rob MacEachern. Sven Gali earned a reputation for their live shows. On the strength of their original songs and live shows, they were signed to BMG Canada, after playing some key gigs in New York and Los Angeles. They were signed to a seven-album contract, with international release through BMG subsidiary Ariola. As they began recording an album, the band collectively decided to fire MacEachern and hire on former Billy Idol drummer Gregg Gerson. Gerson, their third drummer, had previously played with Roger Daltrey, Mick Jagger, and Mick Jones. With this new lineup intact, they released their debut album in 1992. Sven Gali was produced by BMG Canada's David Bendeth. The album included the singles and videos for \\"Under The Influence\\", \\"Tie Dyed Skies\\", \\"In My Garden\\", and the ballad, \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\". It included a cover of the Teenage Head song \\"Disgusteen\\" featuring guest vocals by Frankie Venom. The band made four music videos, all of which were on regular rotation on Much Music. The video for \\"Under the Influence\\" won the MuchMusic Best Metal Video award in 1993. Sven Gali eventually went gold in Canada. In 1992 through 1994 the band toured Canada and the US, Germany, Belgium, Ireland and the UK, headlining and supporting acts including Wolfsbane, Foreigner, Meatloaf, April Wine and Def Leppard. Inwire and breakup: 1994-1996 The 1993 Juno Awards recognized Sven Gali and they were nominated for two awards, ‚ÄúMost Promising Group‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHard Rock Album Of The Year‚Äù. Shortly after this, the band began to work on their second album. They recorded in Seattle with production duties handled by future Queensr√øche guitarist Kelly Gray. Prior to this, Gerson left the band and was replaced by their fourth drummer, Mike Ferguson. Ferguson and Gray had previously played together in a Seattle band called Dog Daze. The album, called Inwire (1995), featured guest musicians Christopher Thorn of Blind Melon, and Candlebox's Kevin Martin and Scott Mercado. This second album had a distinctly different sound, which the band called an experiment, and which was influenced by Gray. Old Sven Gali fans did not respond well to their change of sound, and the band were heavily criticized for what was perceived as jumping on the grunge rock bandwagon. The band toured behind Inwire until 1996, when the group disbanded. Reunion and 3 On August 11, 2007, Sven Gali reunited and played live for the first time in over 11 years at The Moose N Goose in Thorold, Ontario. Rob MacEachern returned on drums as a member. The concert was recorded and is planned to be released on DVD in the future. Guitarist Dee Cernile was diagnosed with cancer, and two benefit concerts were held for him on August 1 and August 7, 2009. Originally it was not known if Cernile would be able to play, so his brother Walter was tapped to fill in if need be. Cernile did play guitar on both nights, and according to former Slash Puppet vocalist Mif, \\"if I didn't know any better I wouldn't know that there was anything wrong with the [...] guy. He was shredding all [...] night.\\" Dee Cernile died of lung cancer on February 25, 2012, aged 46. A new single called \\"Kill the Lies\\" was released in 2018. The band also announced tour dates in Canada and Great Britain. \\"You Wont Break Me\\" followed in 2019 and the latest single \\"Now\\" was released in 2020. The album 3, the band's first full album in 25 years, was released on June 12, 2020.http://bravewords.com/news/sven-gali-frontman-dave-wanless- looks-back-on-the-early-days-talks-reunion-we-never-said-the-band-was-over-we- knew-one-day-something-would-pop-up Discography *Sven Gali (1992) BMG Canada *Inwire (1995) BMG Canada *3 (2020) RFL Recordshttp://bravewords.com/news/sven-gali-frontman-dave-wanless-looks-back- on-the-early-days-talks-reunion-we-never-said-the-band-was-over-we-knew-one- day-something-would-pop-up Singles *\\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" (1993) [#6 Canadian (Anglo) Single of 1993] *\\"Kill the Lies\\" (2018) Videos *Whisper In the Rain (1990) *Under the Influence (1992) *Tie Dyed Skies (1993) *Here In my Garden (1993) *Love Don't Live Here Anymore (1993) *What You Give (1995) *Keeps Me Down (1995) *Kill The Lies (2018) *You Wont Break Me(2019)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXWelgQ5i3k *Now (2020)http://bravewords.com/news/sven-gali-frontman-dave-wanless-looks-back- on-the-early-days-talks-reunion-we-never-said-the-band-was-over-we-knew-one- day-something-would-pop-up Members * Dave Wanless - lead vocals (1987‚ÄìPresent) * Andy Frank - guitar (1987‚ÄìPresent) * Sean Williamson - guitar (2018‚ÄìPresent) * Shawn \\"T.T.\\" Minden - bass (1987‚ÄìPresent) * Dan Fila - drums (2018‚Äìpresent) Past members * Dee Cernile - guitar (1987-2012; Died) * Steve Macgregor - drums (1987-1989) * Rob MacEachern - drums (1989-1991, 2007-2009) * Gregg Gerson - drums (1991-1993) * Mike Ferguson - drums (1994-1996) * Roger Habel Jr. - drums (2008-2017; touring) Member activity Most of the members of Sven Gali are active elsewhere. * Dave Wanless has, as of 2005, also fronted The Betty Ford Band in the Niagara region. * Andy Frank has also been working in China as of 2005. * Shawn Minden has been working with George H.

The city developed first as a maritime center after the American Revolution, as a railroad hub during the great American westward expansion, and as an important manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. By the 21st century, electric locomotive building is all that remains of big industry, but smaller-scale steel and plastics manufacturers, as well as health care, insurance, tourism and recreation have emerged as Erie's new diverse mix of key industries.  Employment   Unemployment statistics  As of January 2017, Erie's unemployment rate was 6.6%. This compares to a 5.2% unemployment rate for Pennsylvania and 4.8% for the country as a whole.Erie, PA Economy at a Glance. (n.d.). Retrieved April 05, 2017, from https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.pa_erie_msa.htm  Top industries and employers  As of June 2005, Erie's top-ten employers by size of work force are the government (6,435 persons, or 30%), manufacturers (5,200 persons, or 24%), medical services (4,774 persons, or 22%), and other (insurance, retail, and public utilities) (4,950 persons, or 23%). This diversity is less apparent among firms with fewer employees, however. For example, manufacturing is a significant 39% of the local economy among firms with 200 to 500 employees (18 of 46 firms). Erie is no longer the corporate headquarters of GE Transportation Systems (which is transferring its locomotive works to Fort Worth, Texas in 2018). But is home to others such as Plastek Industries, and Erie Insurance Group. GE Transportation is a world leader in railroad, marine, mining, and energy industries and farm outs. The Plastek Group is a major manufacturer of plastic packaging materials for consumer goods, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, as well as connectors for cars, circuit cards, card holders, and other plastic products. Erie Insurance Group handles a wide range of insurance products, including life, health, automobile, and homeowners.  Manufacturing and technology industries  Heavy industry is on the decline in Erie. However, smaller, high-precision companies are growing in size and scope. For example, Lord Corporation, which specializes in shock- and vibration-damping products for the aerospace industry, was founded in and has major operations in Erie. The plastics industry is a vital part of Erie's economy. Over 10% of the nation's plastics are manufactured or finished in Erie-based plastics plants. These plants are supported by many locally owned CNC machine tool job shops. Erie is an emerging center for biofuels and environmental research. Erie Biofuels, located on the former Hammermill Paper plant, will begin producing biodiesel in fall 2007, with an expected production volume of of biofuel per year. The Erie Plating Company is also headquartered in Erie.  Tourism and entertainment industries  Tourism plays an increasingly important role in the local economy as the number of visitors continues to rise. The millions who visit Presque Isle State Park also frequent downtown Erie and regional attractions. In February 2007, the Presque Isle Downs racino opened for business in Summit Township, creating more jobs and drawing even more tourists into the area. As of May 2007, five new hotels are under construction in downtown Erie, Summit Township and Millcreek Township.Guerriero, John, Another hotel planned for mall, Erie Times-News, 4 May 2007, pp 1A, 4A  Economic development  The following municipal, county, and state programs are vital aspects of the economic development of the Erie community.

It routinely works with the Erie County General Authority (ECGA), the Erie County Community Services Financing Authority (ECCSFA), the Erie Industrial Development Corporation (EIDCO), the Erie County Industrial Development Authority (ECIDA), the Enterprise Development Fund of Erie County, and the Greater Erie Industrial Development Corporation (GEIDC). EDCEC assists with state financing and incentive programs.  Local Economic Revitalization Tax Act (LERTA)  Mayor Rick Fillipi established an aggressive citywide real estate tax abatement program in November 2002, overhauling a more modest tax abatement program dating back to the 1970s that only applied to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Local Economic Revitalization Tax Act (LERTA) plan allows a 100% ten-year tax exemption for the costs of new construction or improvements to property. The program in its current form expires on 13 November 2007. The City Council, the Erie School Board, and the Erie County Council must approve any new program.Palatiella, Ed, Revised LERTA plan: Shorten program, target blighted areas, Erie Times-News, 6 May 2007, pp 1A, 8A  Keystone Innovation Zone (Erie KIZ)  The Technology Council of Northwest Pennsylvania (TCNWP) is the regional coordinator of Erie KIZ (see program details), one of a number of programs of the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) (see DCED Program Finder). KIZ aims to bring businesses and universities together to promote technological innovations and therefore regional economic development at the nexus of education and commerce.  Keystone Opportunity Zone (KOZ)  State and local tax relief is provided to qualified Erie businesses, residents, and property owners to encourage them to develop designated Keystone Opportunity Zones. Erie falls under the jurisdiction of the Northwest Regional Planning and Development Commission (see map) for coordination of KOZ matters with the commonwealth.  Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area (NRSA)  The city's Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD), in cooperation with selected urban neighborhood stakeholders, submitted a five-year plan to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in February 2006, which prioritizes and coordinates a range of existing neighborhood development efforts. The NRSA plan targets improvements to the center city neighborhoods known as the SNOOPS Neighborhood Watch, the Central City Neighborhood Alliance Neighborhood Watch, the Center City East neighborhood, the Little Italy neighborhood, and a section of the Downtown Improvement District (DID). HUD approval allows the city access to federal funds through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. see details in the NRSA plan References ","title":"Economy of Erie, Pennsylvania"},{"id":"11723133","text":"Diadema is the term for diadem in most Romance languages, and in English may refer to: * Diadema, S√£o Paulo, a city in S√£o Paulo * Diadema (genus), a genus of sea urchin belonging to the family Diadematidae * Diadema (fungi), a genus of fungi in the family Diademaceae * Damon diadema, a species of arachnid, sometimes known as the tailless whip scorpion * Sinea diadema, a species of the assassin bug family, native to North America ","title":"Diadema"},{"id":"11723140","title":"Christina Pazsitzky"},{"id":"11723164","text":"Tuj () may refer to: * Tuj, Hormozgan * Tuj, South Khorasan * Tuj, alternate name of Tajag, South Khorasan See also * Temple University, Japan Campus (TUJ) ","title":"Tuj"},{"id":"11723170","text":"Marlbank is a small community located in Tweed, Ontario, Canada, a few kilometers west of Highway 41. In 1904, a fire erupted at the site which currently contains the tavern, but the building was rebuilt in 1905, and was known as The Stinson House. The owners opened their doors and served beverages to patrons. In 1907, the building and ownership changed hands to Mr. William O'Keefe, who renamed the pub after himself, calling it the O'Keefe House, shortened and regularly referred to as the \\"O.K. House\\". The business held fast to this name through several years and owners until 1938 when Sam Schell dubbed the building \\"The Marlbank House\\". After a fire destroyed most of the building again in 1994, the tavern's name changed once more, quite fittingly, to \\"the Marlbank Phoenix Tavern\\". From early 2009, the Tavern was closed for almost two years and left to fall into disrepair. Two local residents, Ray and Ivy Hutchinson, and their son David took it upon themselves to rescue this historical landmark and after major renovations, the Marlbank Phoenix Tavern was reopened for business in January 2011.

A native of Pocatello, Idaho, who grew up in Sacramento, California, Salkeld batted left- handed, threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Early years Salkeld's professional career was almost ended at the age of 19 by a serious knee injury that caused him to miss seasons. He was able to return to baseball as the 22-year-old player-manager of the 1939 Tucson Cowboys of the Class D Arizona‚ÄìTexas League. He then spent 1940‚Äì44 in the top-level Pacific Coast League. Major league career Salkeld made his Major League debut at age 28 with the 1945 Pirates during the final year of the World War II manpower shortage. As a rookie, Salkeld batted .311 with 15 home runs in only 317 plate appearances and finished 24th in the National League Most Valuable Player voting. Although his productivity declined during the postwar period as ex- Major Leaguers returned to the game from military service, Salkeld kept his Major League foothold for most of the next four seasons. Traded to the Boston Braves after the campaign, Salkeld platooned with right-handed hitter Phil Masi in 1948 as the Braves stormed to their first National League championship in 34 years. Salkeld then appeared in five games of the 1948 World Series against the Cleveland Indians. In 15 plate appearances, he collected two hits and five walks plus one sacrifice hit for an on-base percentage of .500. Salkeld's solo home run off future Hall of Famer Bob Feller in the sixth inning of Game 5 tied the contest at five; the following inning, Boston scored six runs to salt away an 11‚Äì5 victory (although Cleveland prevailed in the Series, four games to two). In 1949, he batted .255 in 66 games for Boston, with five home runs and 25 RBIs. Salkeld played a single game for the Chicago White Sox in April 1950, then spent the remainder of the season with the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. In six seasons, Salkeld batted .273 (232-for-850) with 111 runs, 31 home runs and 132 RBI. On August 4, 1945 he hit for the cycle. Later years After leaving baseball after the 1953 minor league season, Salkeld settled in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, where he had worked in the motion picture industry during off- seasons. He died from cancer at the age of 50 in 1967 and was buried at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles. Four years later, his grandson Roger was born in Burbank, California. Roger Salkeld would be chosen by the Seattle Mariners in the first round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft, and appear in 45 MLB games as a right-handed pitcher for the Mariners and Cincinnati Reds during the mid-1990s.

He was one of the most prominent emigrants from Sierra Leone resident in Lagos during the second half of the nineteenth century. From 1879-1893, he was the principal of the CMS Grammar School, Lagos and was later ordained a priest. During his time, he was one of the most loved among his peers of clergymen.Ayandele, Emmanuel \\"Holy\\" Johnson, Pioneer of African Nationalism, 1836-1917, Routledge, 1970; pp. 108, 153‚Äì155, 249. . A reason which may have led to his recommendation as a bishop after a leading radical candidate, James Johnson, complained about the neglect of indigenous control of the Church of Missionary Society. Life Chas. Phillips, J. White, Archdeacon Hamilton, Nathaniel Johnson, Isaac Oluwole, R.E. Willoughby Middle row: Rev. V.S. Wright, Mrs. Ingham, Bishop Ingham, Mrs Darwin Fox, Rev. James Johnson, Rev. J.W. Dickinson Front row: Rev. F.W.Dodd, Rev. W. Darwin Fox Oluwole was born in Abeokuta to a father of Ijebu heritage and mother from Ilesha. His parents were members of the Anglican Church in Abeokuta under Henry Townsend. He lost his father at the age of 13 and at the request of Townsend, he was placed under the care of Dr Harrison, a CMS missionary who was training other children in the region. Oluwole attended the Anglican elementary school in Ake, Abeokuta and continued his education at the Anglican Training Institution also in Abeokuta. When the school was moved to Lagos after protests against missionaries in Abeokuta, Oluwole continued his studies in Lagos. After completing his education, he taught for four years with the Anglican mission. In 1876, at the request of Rev. J.B. Wood, he was sponsored to attend Fourah Bay College where he ended up earning his bachelor's degree. Along with N.S. Davies and Obadiah Johnson, Oluwole was among the first students to obtain a bachelor's degree from the school in 1879 through the college's affiliation with the University of Durham. After the death of Rev T. B. Macaulay, a son-in-law of Bishop Ajayi Crowther in 1879, the Church Missionary Society chose to elect Oluwole as the new principal of C.M.S. Grammar School, Lagos. Thereafter, he was sent to England for further studies before taking the position. He was ordained a deacon in 1881 and a priest in 1884. After the death of Bishop Crowther, CMS elected to nominate an Englishman as the new Bishop who will hold title of Bishop of Western Equatorial Africa and also chose to nominate two African assistant bishops. Rev. J. Sidney Hill was made bishop designate and following a preliminary mission undertaken by Hill, Oluwole and Rev. Charles Philips were nominated to become Assistant Bishops.

The History of the Church Missionary Society. 4 vols. London: The Society, 1899-1916; p. 398 On December 13, 1893, Oluwole, Hill, Philips and 12 other English priests arrived Lagos. However, Hill and his wife died shortly. Hill died on January 6, 1894, just after spending 24 days in Lagos. Herbert Tugwell was chosen as Hill's replacement. In 1920, the Diocese of Equatorial Africa was split into two, the Lagos and Diocese on the Niger. Oluwole's title was changed to Assistant Bishop of the Diocese of Lagos. He married in 1888 and had six children, three of whom died before 1932. His son Isaac Ladipo Oluwole studied medicine at the University of Glasgow graduating MB ChB in 1918.

Rodney Jones as a partner. Specializing in R&B; and soul music, for a few months the label was called Twilight Records until it was discovered that another company already owned the Twilight name. Over five years, the label released (or at least recorded) 55 singles and charted seven times. The label‚Äôs star was Syl Johnson, an established R&B; performer who had had a number of hits for King Records and who would have his biggest hits for Hi Records in the 1970s. Syl Johnson was the star of Twinight Records and he was also one of the main producers for other acts on the company roster. Johnson‚Äôs hits at Twinight included \\"Come on Sock it to Me\\" (1967), \\"Sorry ‚ÄòBout Dat\\", \\"Different Strokes\\", \\"Is It Because I'm Black\\" (1969), and \\"Concrete Reservation\\". Some of these songs were recorded with Willie Mitchell in Memphis, which would later prove the undoing for the company, as Mitchell eventually lured Johnson away to Hi Records in 1971. The success of Johnson's music permitted the company to scout and record local Chicago talent, making numerous recordings of varying quality. Johnson proved to be an able producer as well as performer, and he often produced the songs on behalf of the company. While many of the artists never went on to later fame, some standout material was produced including singles by Nate Evans (who later joined The Impressions), The Perfections, Velma Perkins (later charting as Vee Allen), Krystal Generation, Johnny Williams, The Notations, The Radiants, and Annette Poindexter. The house band was called Pieces of Peace. Donny Hathaway got his start at Twinight, penning songs for other artists on the roster before moving on to better things. Except for Johnson‚Äôs hits, the only other artists to chart were The Notations (\\"I'm Still Here\\") and falsetto Renaldo Domino, whose ‚ÄúNot Too Cool to Cry‚Äù reached Number 7 on the Chicago R&B; charts in 1970. As a rule, the Twinight singles were all relegated to the ‚Äúlunar rotation‚Äù of late night radio, which virtually guaranteed them a place in everlasting obscurity. Within a few months of Johnson‚Äôs defection, the label folded early in 1972. The Twinight name was recently revitalized by Syl Johnson's daughter, the vocalist and songwriter Syleena Johnson, who used the label for some of her early releases. In 2006, The Numero Group issued a compilation of Twinight recordings. In 2012, the song \\"Powerful Love\\", recorded by Chuck & Mac in 1970, is featured several times in the film Looper.

Design and development It is a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Its design was a scaled-down version of the aircraft that Yves Gardan had designed for SIPA, the SIPA S.90. The pilot and passenger sit side by side and access to the cockpit is via a one-piece perspex canopy that hinges forwards. Gardan's intention was to produce a low-cost, easy-to- fly, easy-to-maintain aircraft with the possibility of homebuilding. Production The prototype Minicab first flew at Pau-Idron on 1 February 1949 with Max Fischl at the controls. CAB manufactured a total of 22 Minicabs. This was followed by a larger number completed by amateur builders in France and other countries around the world. Several Minicabs currently active in the United Kingdom have been built or rebuilt to the JB.01 standard developed by M. Jean Barritault. Falconar sold plans for a tricycle gear homebuilt model named the Minihawk. Operational history Minicab built to Barritault JB.01 standard at Cranfield in 1960 Type certification was obtained in mid-April 1949. By the end of 1950, a Minicab had won the Coupe de Vitesse de Deauville (Deauville Cup for speed), and the Grand Prix A√©rien de Vichy (Vichy Aerial Prize). The following year, a Minicab broke the world air distance record for its class (1,825 km, 1,138 miles) and in 1952 it attained the world airspeed record for its class over a 2,000 km circuit, with an average speed of (183 km/h, 114 mph).

He was commissioned in 1940 through ROTC and saw combat in World War II, earning the Distinguished Service Cross for valor on the Anzio Beachhead in Italy. He also fought in North Africa, Sicily, France, and Germany. Rosson obtained his bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Oregon. After retirement from the military he earned a Master of Letters degree in International Relations from New College, Oxford University in England. His military schooling includes the U.S. Army War College and the National War College. Major command experience for Rosson includes Commanding General for Task Force Oregon (Provisional), Commanding General for I Field Force, and Commanding General, Provisional Corps, for the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. Later he was Deputy Commander for the same command. Rosson concluded his career as Commander in Chief of the United States Southern Command in Quarry Heights, Panama Canal Zone. Additional assignments include serving in General Eisenhower's NATO headquarters in Paris, and duty with the French Forces in Vietnam in 1954. Because of this experience, he was valuable to General Westmoreland as Chief of Staff for the U.S. Military Assistance Command in Vietnam. Rosson also served as Director of the Plans and Policy Directorate, J5, for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, D.C.. In addition to the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second highest decoration for valor, General Rosson's awards include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart.

He was also a pioneer in the development of halftone printing of color photographs. Early life Born in Hesse, Germany, he was apprenticed to a lithographer in Offenbach am Main at a young age and showed considerable artistic talent, taking first place in exhibitions while attending an art school there. However, after his two years of compulsory military service, he found he had lost his apprenticeship and moved to England to try his luck. Unable to find work there, he joined the British German Legion and went to fight in the Crimean War. After the war, he was still unable to gain employment as a lithographer, so he became a sailor for several years. In 1859, he decided he would travel to China with a friend. En route to San Francisco, his ship wrecked off the Falkland Islands. The passengers and crew were rescued and he was taken to New York City. Here, he was able to find work in a photography studio. When the American Civil War began, he enlisted in the New York Seventh Regiment and served with them intermittently over the course of the war. In 1865, he entered into a partnership with fellow photographer George G. Rockwood, who was credited with popularizing the carte de visite in America. The next year he formed a studio with another partner, named Huston. The two of them practiced a technique called \\"photosculpture\\", which involved taking up to 24 simultaneous photographs of a subject from various angles to assist a sculptor to create a sculpture of that person. Finally in 1873, he established a studio on his own in Madison Square. Halftone pioneer Still life of fruit, printed using the three-color process (January 1893) Learning of Georg Meisenbach's success with halftone printing in England, Kurtz set out to reproduce the process and in doing so, became one of the United States' first commercial practitioners of reproducing photographic plates in halftone prints. This proved very profitable for him. Likewise, when Hermann Wilhelm Vogel's advances in color photography became known, Kurtz arranged to purchase the American rights to the \\"three-color process\\" from Vogel and was able to devise a way to apply it to halftone printing. In doing so, he‚Äîin conjunction with Vogel's son Ernst‚Äîwas able to produce superior results and drive the cost of color printing down dramatically, so much so that Vogel himself acknowledged that Kurtz's adaptations had improved on his own discoveries. Using this process, Kurtz made the first color images that were widely reproduced‚Äîa still life of fruit on a table‚Äîbeing published in the January 1, 1893, edition of Photographische Mittheilungen, a German photography journal published by Vogel. The same image was later published in the U.S. in the March 1893 issue of Engraver & Printer. Other photography innovations Beginning in the 1860s, vignetted heads and upper torsos became a popular style of portrait photographs known as the \\"Rembrandt style\\". Kurtz perfected a process using a series of reflectors to concentrate and bounce sunlight onto the subject's face. With the subject seated against a dark background, the result emphasized strong features and masked weaker ones. However, this technique was limited by daylight hours and weather. The winter months proved to be especially problematic (as demand for studio portraits happened to rise then), and Kurtz was one of the first people to use electric lighting to achieve the same effect. Later life Kurtz spent the last years of his life in Far Rockaway, Queens. He had spent his summers there since 1879, and moved there permanently in 1899. He died at his home on December 5, 1904, from pneumonia. He was survived by his wife, four daughters, and three sons.

He spent most of his career with the Phillies, batting .316 as a rookie in 1922 and .324 in 1923 before his playing time gradually decreased. Born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Henline was working in Cleveland, Ohio in 1918 when a local restaurant owner - aware of Henline's play on semi-pro teams - encouraged him to contact former star Nap Lajoie, who lived nearby. After doing so, he was signed two weeks later by the Indianapolis club of the American Association, but did not join the team until the following year due to military service during World War I. In his 1922 rookie year with the Phillies, he led the National League in fielding percentage with a .983 mark, and on September 15 of that year he hit three home runs. In March 1925, Henline was named team captain of the Phillies. After his playing career ended in the minor leagues in 1934, he became a motel operator in Florida, but took up umpiring soon afterward after recalling that Bill Klem had encouraged him to pursue the profession. He began working in the Southeastern League before moving up to the International League from 1940 to 1944, and then the NL. Henline served as an NL umpire from 1945 to 1948, and officiated in the 1947 All-Star Game. He went on to become supervisor of umpires in the Florida International League from 1949 to 1954 before that league folded. He died of cancer at age 62 at his home in Sarasota, Florida, and his cremated remains were interred at Manasota Memorial Park in Bradenton. On August 24, 1948, Henline was the first umpire to eject Jackie Robinson from a major league game. Robinson, Bruce Edwards, and coach Clyde Sukeforth were ejected for bench jockeying in a game at Forbes Field against the Pittsburgh Pirates. https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1948/B08240PIT1948.htm In 740 games over 11 seasons, Henline compiled a .291 batting average (611-for-2101) with 258 runs, 96 doubles, 21 triples, 40 home runs, 268 RBI, 192 base on balls, .361 on-base percentage and .414 slugging percentage.

History The private Society was founded in 1866 by Francisco Asenjo Barbieri and Joaqu√≠n Gaztambide, who assumed responsibility for its organization and artistic direction. It was the heir of the orchestra formed by the Sociedad Art√≠stico Musical de Socorros Mutuos which was based at the Teatro Real in Madrid. Barbieri conducted the Orchestra during its inaugural season and was succeeded by Gatzambide in the following. The first musical director who served at length was Jes√∫s de Monasterio, who was appointed in 1869 and remained until 1876. The Orchestra divided its activities between theatrical productions and symphonic concerts, and contributed to the spread of Wagernism and European symphonic music in Spain. It advanced the careers of new Spanish talents, such as Tom√°s Bret√≥n, Joaqu√≠n Turina, Ruperto Chap√≠, and Isaac Alb√©niz. In 1876, the conductorship passed to Mariano V√°zquez G√≥mez, under whose guidance the Orchestra offered Spanish audiences the chance to hear the complete cycle of Beethoven's symphonies in their homeland for the first time. On 27 February 1898, the Orchestra gave a performance Richard Strauss' symphonic poem Don Quixote at the Teatro Pr√≠ncipe Alfonso on the Paseo de Recoletos, which was conducted by the composer himself. Other famous conductors who were invited to the Orchestra included Luigi Mancinelli and Jer√≥nimo Gim√©nez. Due to a major economic crisis and irreconcilable disagreements between the section leaders of the Orchestra, the Society was dissolved in 1903. The majority of its members regrouped to form the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de Madrid, which has continued to play to the present day.

Calder was educated in New Zealand (Milton local school and the Otago Boys' High School in Dunedin 1876-77), and then attended Otago University. He became a cadet in the Government Survey Department in October 1883 and after five years of practical training, he passed the authorized surveyors' examination with credit in July 1888, and was responsible for much road construction and exploration in the North and South islands of the Dominion.Calder, William (1860‚Äì1928) Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition Migration to Australia In 1888 he came to Victoria and worked in private engineering and surveying firms. In October 1889 he became assistant town surveyor for the City of Footscray, and in July 1890 town engineer. At night he studied to gain certificates as municipal engineer (1890) and engineer of Water supply (1892). From December 1897 to March 1913, Calder was city engineer and building surveyor to the City of Prahran. Among the works he is credited with are the first asphalted carpet- road surface, the first refuse destructor in Australia, and the completion of a major drainage project. By March 1903 he was an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, London, and a member of the Institution of Municipal and County Engineers of Great Britain. Country Roads Board Calder made the greatest impact as the first Chairman for the Country Roads Board (CRB) from 1913 to 1928. Among his first tasks was to undertake an exhaustive inspection of the road system, which had been neglected by the responsible municipalities and state government since the building of the railways. Calder was known as a meticulous note-taker and enthusiastic photographer, and his notes recording the board's progress were transcribed and used as a basic reference for many years. Despite, shortages of money and manpower for road-building as a consequence of the Great War, Calder campaigned successfully for more funds, especially for arterial roads, both publicly and privately. He toured Europe and North America in 1924 examining road-construction practice and road-administration and reported extensively on matters such as the controversy on the American concrete pavement techniques versus British asphalt. His report, published that year, is widely regarded as a classic of road-construction practice and road-administration.Report on his investigation of road problems in Europe and America during 1924, W. Calder (William), [Country Roads Board], Government Printer, Melbourne 1925; available State Library of Victoria Legacy Many of Calder's recommendations were included in the important Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924,State of Victoria, An Act to make further provision with respect to Highways and Country Roads Motor Cars and Traction Engines and for other purposes 30 December 1924 which provided for the declaration of State highways, two-thirds financed by the State government through the C.R.B. This network of highways is perhaps Calder's main achievement: the Calder Highway, the road to Bendigo and Mildura was named after him. The Country roads Board's system of organization was copied in other States, New Zealand and Fiji. Calder was a strong advocated for Federal assistance in highway construction, and attended the first meeting of the Federal Aid Roads Board set up under the Act of 1926. Personal life Calder had married Elizabeth Bagley Palmer of Dunedin on 4 November 1889 at Brunswick, Victoria. He was a devout Presbyterian and member of his church boards of management of Footscray and Armadale. He had close links with Professor Henry Payne of the University of Melbourne. Calder was known as a 'champion shot', and assisted with military training in the Moorooduc area during World War I. He hoped to retire to his small property at Red Hill, Victoria but died of cancer at East Malvern on 18 February 1928. He was still Chairman and chief engineer of the CRB when he died, and was replaced as chief engineer by Donald Victor Darwin. Calder was survived by his wife, a son (Architect Stuart Palmer Calder) and a daughter, and was buried in Cheltenham Pioneer Cemetery after a ceremony at Gardiner Presbyterian Church. Calder's wife was awarded a special State pension by the Victorian Government, which saved her from financial difficulty. Memorials to William Calder include an avenue of trees on the road to Geelong beginning one mile past Werribee, cairns at Warragul and elsewhere in Gippsland, an obelisk on the Princes Highway, at Drouin,Monument Australia (William Calder) a plaque at Frankston Monument Australia (W. Calder) and a bridge at Moe. A portrait of him by Tom Roberts, still hangs in the VicRoads offices, in Kew to this day. References Bibliography * R.

Hauser's major league career was undistinguished, but he made a name for himself in the minor leagues, where he became the first player ever to hit 60 or more home runs twice in a professional career: 63 in 1930, and 69 in 1933. Biography After being discovered playing semi-pro ball in Waupun, Wisconsin, Hauser was signed to begin with Providence of the Eastern League in 1918, and found himself back in his hometown two years later, with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. There he acquired the nickname \\"Unser Choe\\". As he told it, the predominantly German-immigrant fans would support him. If he was having a bad day at the plate and some fans were booing, others would admonish them with, \\"Das ist unser Choe!\\" -- German and German-English for \\"That is our Joe!\\" He had his best major league year statistically in 1924, but a broken leg and slow recovery hampered his career in 1925 and 1926. In 1928, he seemed to get back on track, but his ability to hit major league pitching somehow vanished, and after 1929 he was through in the majors. He later blamed A's player-coach Ty Cobb for over-analyzing and impairing his hitting style. In 629 games over 6 seasons in his major league career, Hauser compiled a .284 batting average (580-for-2044) with 351 runs, 80 home runs and 356 RBI. He recorded a .990 fielding percentage. Back in the minors in 1930, Hauser played for the Baltimore Orioles of the International League and regained his hitting touch, slamming a then-professional record of 63 home runs in one season, in the cozy confines of Oriole Park. He also led the minors in homers in 1931. The Minneapolis Millers of the American Association thought Hauser would be a good addition to the even-cozier Nicollet Park, home of the Millers, and they were right. They bought his contract just before the 1932 season. After a slow start, Hauser hit 49 long ones to lead the Association in home runs. He might have hit more, and challenged the league record of 54 (set by Nick Cullop of the Millers in 1930), but he was rested to allow an injury to heal so that he would be healthy for the Junior World Series. 1933 was Hauser's career year. The league decided to cut its schedule from 168 to 154 games, and Hauser went homer-less in his first nine games, so his prospects for even reaching his previous year's total were in doubt. However, in the home opener, Hauser hit one out in his first at-bat, and then three more the next day, and the long balls began to accumulate. By the end of June, he had reached 32. He hit his 50th on July 27, in Milwaukee. He hit his 54th and 55th in Toledo a couple of weeks later, setting a new league mark. On August 20, he hit his 60th, the first player to hit 60 twice in a professional career. He tied and broke his own professional record by hitting his 63rd and 64th in St. Paul's Lexington Park on Labor Day. He pushed the total to 69, with his chance at 70 rained out. Hauser also collected 182 RBIs and a record-setting 439 total bases. Hauser got off to a good start in 1934, but a fractured kneecap ended his season, and his career wound down after that. He played off and on for the Millers and then Sheboygan before hanging them up in 1943. Following his playing career, he ran a sporting goods shop in Sheboygan until retiring in 1984. Hauser's 69 was eventually matched by Bob Crues in 1948 and surpassed by the 72 of Joe Bauman in 1954. He remained the only player to hit 60 or more twice until Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa accomplished the feat in 1998 and 1999.

He tabled several propositions in order to reform the health care system including faster health care service by introducing what was called the \\"Virage ambulatoire\\" which saw the increase of home health care services. He adopted several of those proposals when he was named the Minister of Health following his election in the Charlesbourg district in the 1994 elections.

He played for the Milwaukee Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Houston Colt .45s. Before appearing in MLB, he was a Negro league player. He was a right-handed batter and thrower, measured tall and weighed . Early life Pendleton was born in 1924 in St. Charles, Missouri. Pendleton joined a Negro minor league team in Asheville before he was promoted to the Negro American League in 1948. Playing shortstop for the Chicago American Giants, he hit .301. The following year, he was in the American Association as an outfielder with the St. Paul Saints, an affiliate of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Upon signing with the Dodgers organization, he took two years off his age. He was the only black player in the American Association at the time of his signing. In 1951, St. Paul moved him back to shortstop. The next year, he played for the Dodgers' minor league team in Montreal. Between 1950 and 1952, Pendleton hit between .291 and .301 each season, averaging 14 home runs and more than 15 triples per year during that period. Despite his minor league success, two factors worked against the possibility of a promotion to the Dodgers. Brooklyn already had a star major league shortstop, Pee Wee Reese, and the franchise was worried about backlash from the rest of baseball if it promoted more than one black player to the major leagues each year. The Dodgers also rejected trade offers from other teams during that time. MLB career With Reese holding strong as the Dodgers shortstop, Brooklyn agreed to a trade that sent Pendleton to the Milwaukee Braves as part of a four-team February 1953 transaction that involved Cincinnati and the Philadelphia Phillies, as well as the Dodgers. He made his MLB debut at 29 on April 17, 1953. On August 30th of that season, Pendleton hit three home runs in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, to become just the second rookie in Major League history to hit three homers in a single game, joining his teammate Eddie Mathews, who dit it a year earlier.Milwaukee Braves Heroes and Heartbreak.

Overall, Pendleton played more than 100 games in the outfield for Milwaukee and batted .299 in a part-time role, which increased his popularity. In 1957, he hit .305 in 46 games for the Pirates, but after three at bats in 1958, he was sent back to the minors for the rest of 1958 campaign.

Biography Born in Oregon, Graham grew up in Seattle, Washington, where he was a graffiti artist. He wrote and illustrated comic books for Antarctic Press and Radio Comix, but got his start drawing pornographic comics such as Pillow Fight, Perverts of the Unknown and the initial issue of Multiple Warheads (Warheads would go on to become an ongoing, more mainstream comic published by Oni Press in 2007). In 1997, he moved to New York City where he found work with NBM Publishing and became a founding member of comics collective Meathaus. His book Escalator was published by Alternative Comics in January 2005, when he returned to Seattle. His book King City was published by Tokyopop in 2007 and was nominated for an Eisner Award. In May 2009 Graham announced that King City would continue publication at Image Comics and his Oni Press title Multiple Warheads would resume publication after a delay, this time in color. At Image he led the revival of Prophet, a sci-fi reboot of Rob Liefeld's 1990s series, with a rotating roster of artists including Giannis Milonogiannis, Farel Dalrymple, and Simon Roy.

Early life Born Hon. Elizabeth Darcy, she was the daughter of Thomas Darcy, 1st Earl Rivers and Mary Kitson (died 1644), a granddaughter of Thomas Kitson. Marriage On 14 May 1602, Elizabeth married Thomas Savage and they had eleven sons and eight daughters. He was the eldest son of Sir John Savage, 1st Baronet and his wife Mary n√©e Allington, from whom he inherited Melford Hall in Suffolk. In 1615, he inherited his father's baronetcy and was created Viscount Savage in 1626. On his death in 1635, Elizabeth (by now Viscountess Savage) inherited Melford. This and St Osyth Priory in Essex formed her principal residences. On the death of Lady Savage's father in 1640, the earldom of Rivers passed to her eldest son, John. As compensation for not enjoying the rank of a countess, she was created Countess Rivers for life in 1641. Allegiances As well as inheriting property and being raised in rank following the death of her father and husband, she also inherited their political and religious allegiances that would later lead to her downfall in the English Civil War. Both men were closely associated with Charles I, had links with George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and both had enforced the king's policies for Essex in the case of Lord Rivers and Lancashire and Cheshire in the case of Lord Savage. Lady Rivers and her husband had both served in Queen Henrietta Maria's court as a Lady of the Bedchamber and Chancellor respectively, due to the family's strong Catholic links. Lady Rivers' father had been suspected of being a Papist, but was protected against recusancy legislation, although he was excluded from the county magistracy. Civil War Following parliament's explanation of the ineffectual settlement with the king to have been caused by a Catholic conspiracy, local grievances heightened rumour and suspicion and Lady Rivers was presented to the Essex justices of the peace as a recusant and her home at St Osyth was searched for arms. Following the attack on Sir John Lucas at Colchester during the Stour Valley riots, St Osyth was ransacked and plundered by the crowds. Forewarned, Lady Rivers had fled to Long Melford but the crowds followed her there, attempting to also destroy that residence. According to a local story, Lady Rivers, upon also escaping Melford, threw a box with a string of pearls into a nearby pond before fleeing. Later life Although attacked by the public in opposition to her family's association with the king and their religious patronage, Lady Rivers secured support from those who did not share the same views. Parliament later ordered her estates to be restored to her, but her tenants subsequently refused to pay rent. After a second episode of invasion of her estates by Parliamentarian soldiers, she sought permission to go to France in May 1643. After her return, she successfully petitioned Parliament to have her estates restored again, but the attacks on them and the fines imposed upon her and her son left her penniless. On her death in 1651, she was said to have been bankrupt and was buried at St Osyth with her ancestors.

It has been called, \\"the most significant school health education initiative of the 1960s\\"Allensworth, et al. 1997 p. 45 and was largely responsible for establishing the value of comprehensive health education rather than separate disease-specific units and in introducing the concept-based approach to education in general. Most health curricula developed since have followed the model set by the SHES in its School Health Curriculum Project.Allensworth, et al., 1995  Origins  In 1960 millionaire distiller and philanthropist Samuel Bronfman asked Dr. Granville Larimore, then Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health and a member of the Joint Committee on Health Problems in Education of the American Medical Association (AMA) and the National Education Association (NEA), to suggest several projects in health or education that should receive funding but were being neglected by governmental and private funders. Dr. Larimore suggested three priorities: (I) graduate medical education, (2) effectiveness of the mass media for health education, and (3) school health education. After hearing presentations on each of these three priorities, the Samuel Bronfman Foundation‚Äôs board decided to provide $200,000 for a study of the status of health education in the nation‚Äôs schools.  Initial study  The Study was envisioned as an independent, two- year-long investigation, affiliated with the American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation (AAHPER) and the National Education Association. Bronfman sought the advice of Delbert Oberteuffer, professor at the Ohio State University and widely regarded as the leading figure in health education at that time, regarding who could best lead the study. Oberteuffer recommended one of his young OSU colleagues, Elena Sliepcevich. Dr. Sliepcevich accepted the appointment and moved to Washington, DC where the SHES leased office space on Dupont Circle in the building next door to the NEA.Johns, 1962; Means, 1975 During its first year, the Study assessed the state of health education offerings in a total of 135 school systems covering 38 states and involving some 1101 individual elementary schools and 359 secondary schools. This survey remains the broadest of its type ever completed in the United States. In the second year test instruments were administered to students in grades 6, 9, and 12 of the participating schools. Of 17,634 usable answer sheets re¬¨turned to the researchers, a weighted sample of 2000 scores for each of the three grade levels representative of the makeup of the school sample was selected for analysis. Analysis of the results required a third year of Bronfman Foundation support and led to the conclusion that the state of health education in the nation‚Äôs public schools was \\"appalling\\".Sliepcevich, 1964  School Health Curriculum Project  The [3M] Corporation funded SHES for a further six years (1963‚Äì1969) to develop a model curriculum‚Äîthe School Health Curriculum Project or SHCP. Ann E. Nolte, of Ohio State University, joined SHES as associate director of the study and a curriculum writing team was assembled, consisting of: William H. Creswell, Jr., professor of health education at the University of Illinois; Gus T. Dalis, of the Los Angeles County Schools; Edward B. Johns, professor of school health education at the University of California, Los Angeles; Marion B. Pollock, assistant professor of health education at California State College, Long Beach; Richard K. Means, professor of health education at Auburn University; and Robert D. Russell, associate professor of health education at Southern Illinois University.Morrow, 1998 Prof. Russell proposed as the initial point of view for the SHCP that health was a unified concept of well- being. This was expressed in the curriculum as follows, \\"Health is a quality of life involving dynamic interaction and interdependence among the individual's physical well-being, his (or her) mental and emotional reactions, and the social complex in which he (or she) exists\\".Creswell, et al., 1967, p. 10 From this starting point, the SHCP writers identified ten key concepts. Sub concepts were then developed in the physical, mental, and social dimen¬¨sions for each of the ten concepts. The 31 sub concepts were each linked to behavioral objectives written at four progressive levels‚Äîgrades K-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12‚Äîin the cognitive, affective, and behavioral domains.  Concepts  The ten concepts developed by the SHES as the basis for the SHCP were: # Growth and development influences and is influenced by the structure and functioning of the individual. # Growing and developing follows a predictable sequence, yet is unique for each individual. # Protection and promotion of health is an individual, community, and international responsibility. # The potential for hazards and accidents exists, whatever the environment. # There are reciprocal relationships involving man (humanity), disease, and environment. # The family serves to perpetuate man (humanity) and to fulfill certain health needs. # Personal health practices are affected by a complexity of forces, often conflicting. # Utilization of health information, products, and services is guided by values and perceptions. # Use of substances that modify mood and behavior arises from a variety of motivations. # Food selection and eating patterns are determined by physical, social, mental, economic, and cultural factors.Creswell, et al., 1967, p. 201 Notes References * Allensworth, D., Wyche, J., Lawson, E., and Nicholson, L.

Life and work Hovel near Yalmton, Devon Payne hit upon certain methods which considerably increased the resources of watercolour art, especially in the rendering of sunlight and atmosphere. His 'style,' as it was called, was one which was not only new and effective, but could be learnt without much difficulty, and he soon became the most fashionable drawing-master in London. Among the innovations with which he is credited were \\"splitting the brush to give forms of foliage, dragging the tints to give texture to his foregrounds, and taking out the forms of lights by wetting the surface and rubbing with bread and rag\\". He also abandoned the use of outline with the pen, but the invention by which he is best known is a neutral tint composed of indigo, raw sienna, and lake called Payne's grey. His methods were regarded as tricky by the old-fashioned practitioners of the day. but there is no doubt that he did much to advance the technique of watercolour painting, and was one of the first 'draughtsmen' to abandon mere topography for a more poetical treatment of landscape scenery. In 1809 he was elected an associate of the Watercolour Society, but left it after the reform of the original society in 1812. During the four years of his connection with the society he sent seventeen drawings to their exhibitions. By this time his art had degenerated into mannerism. He was surpassed by better artists, and forgotten before he died in London in 1830. References Sources Further reading *Long, Basil S.

A type of porphyria is caused by production of uroporphyrinogen I instead of III. Biosynthesis and metabolism In living organisms, uroporphirinogen I occurs as a side branch of the main porphyrin synthesis pathway. In the normal pathway, the linear tetrapyrrole precursor preuroporphyrinogen (a substituted hydroxymethylbilane) is converted by the enzyme uroporphyrinogen-III cosynthase into the cyclic uroporphyrinogen III; which is then converted to coproporphyrinogen III on the way to porphyrins like heme. Uroporphyrinogen I is instead produced spontaneously from preouroporphyrinogen when the enzyme is not present. Uroporphyrinogen I synthesis from preuroporphyrinogen The difference between the I and III forms is the arrangement of the four carboxyethyl groups (propionic acidd, \\"P\\") and the four carboxymethyl groups (acetic acid, \\"A\\"). The non-enzymatic conversion to uroporphyrinogen I results in the sequence AP- AP-AP-AP, whereas the enzymatic conversion into uroporphyrinogen III lead to reversal of one AP-group and hence an AP-AP-AP-PA arrangement. If synthesized, uroporphyrinogen I is then converted into coproporphyrinogen I by the same enzyme (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase) that acts on the III form; but that product, which is cytotoxic, then accumulates causing the pathology congenital erythropoietic porphyria.

Meltzer moved to Connecticut and launched the company, which was the first of its kind to distribute only compact discs, out of his house in Ridgefield. Meltzer later rented an office and warehouse in neighboring Bethel. But the company's growth was enormous. By 1989, its of office space and warehouse were barely enough. It moved to a facility in Bethel's Francis J. Clarke Industrial park. By 1992, the company had knocked down the northeast wall and doubled the warehouse to . By this time, it was also distributing cassettes and had taken over some exclusive distribution lines owned by Schwartz Bros. CD One Stop also opened a West Coast office at this time outside of Sacramento to compete with Valley Distributors. In 1993, the company was sold to Alliance Entertainment Corp., a holding company buying up distributors such as Encore (Denver), Bassin (Miami), and Abbey Road (Los Angeles). Meltzer, and his key management staff, became the odd men out. But Meltzer was rumored to have invested heavily in a startup called CD Now, an early online music store, which later sold to Amazon becoming its music arm. Meltzer's first attempt at a record label was in 1996 with Grass Records, which morphed into Wind Up Entertainment, which gave us the likes of Creed, Evanescence, and Seether.

It is made of broken-down hemoglobin. It is further processed to become the chemical that gives feces its brown color.Stercobilinogen, drugs.com Bilirubin is a pigment that results from the breakdown of the heme portion of hemoglobin. The liver conjugates bilirubin, making it water-soluble; and the conjugated form is then excreted in urine as urobilinogen. Urobilinogen is colourless and is further oxidised to urobilin which imparts colour to feces. Darkening of feces upon standing in air is due to the oxidation of residual urobilinogens to urobilins. In the intestine, bilirubin is converted by bacteria to stercobilinogen. Stercobilinogen is absorbed and excreted by either the liver or the kidney. Stercobilinogen is oxidized to stercobilin, which is responsible for the pigmentation of feces. In early liver disease, impaired biliary excretion causes sterocobilinogen to be absorbed mostly by the kidney, and, therefore, stercobilinogen will appear in the urine in excess as urobilinogen. This happens because \\"Stercobilinogen\\" is simply the name given to Urobilinogen in the GI tract; and in fact its use as a separate term has fallen out of favor due to the confusion.

He held the titles of comes (count) and dux (duke) and he ruled over a marca (march). He may have been the son of Hadulf, son of Thankulf. Thachulf was placed in charge of the Sorbian March in 849 with the title of dux Sorabici limitis, giving him military command over the counts with lands bordering the Sorbs. On account of his knowledge of Slavic customs, he was petitioned by the Sorbs with the offer of hostages for peace to protect them from the warmaking of Ernest, Duke of Bavaria, but he had been wounded in battle the day before the arrival of the Slav embassy and so could not be of assistance. Hiding his injury from the Slav delegates, he sent men to the other leaders of the Frankish host proposing terms with the Slavs, but the other generals suspected him of a coup to assume supreme command of the army and so ignored his representatives and made war anyway, being badly defeated in the process. According to the Annales Fuldenses, in 858, a Reichstag held at Frankfurt under Louis the German sent three armies to the eastern frontiers to reinforce the submission of the Slavic tribes. Carloman was sent against Great Moravia, Louis the Younger against the Obodrites and Linonen, and Thachulf against the Sorbs, who were refusing to obey him. The armies of Carloman and Louis set out in July, but it is uncertain if Thachulf ever undertook a campaign, as the Sorbs rose in rebellion late in that year and do not appear to have been restless beforehand. The Annales Fuldenses may be incorrect about the timing of Thachulf's command to send an army against them. Thachulf died in the summer of 873. His death was immediately followed by the revolt of the Sorbs, Siusli, and their neighbours. The revolt was not put down until Liutbert and Radulf, Thachulf's successor, campaigned in January 874.

Early life Richard Olamilege Blaize was born in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to the family of emancipated slaves of Yoruba origin. His parents were Ojelabi Olapajuokun (who later took the name John Blaize) and Maria Blaize. At an early age, he attended a mission school and was nurtured in the Christian way. He started work as an apprentice for a printer in Freetown but soon left the country for the Lagos Colony in 1862. Career in business and political activism Business After arriving Lagos in 1862, Blaize worked as a printer for Robert Campbell, editor of Anglo-American. He then left printing for merchandise trading and importation. In trading, the participants were numerous, especially those from Lagos; most of the traders mainly dealt with exchanging goods with exporters and a few delved into exportation.Ayodeji Olukoju. \\"Anatomy of Business-Government Relations: Fiscal Policy and Mercantile Pressure Group Activity in Nigeria, 1916‚Äì1933\\", African Studies Review, Vol. 38, No. 1, April 1995, p. 24. A number of traders owned steamers, which were used to navigate the Niger River to buy goods from groups across river, and some even boasted they showed the imperialists how to move across the river. Blaize was among a few of the Lagos merchants to be very successful in trading; he was an importer and was also involved with trade across the Niger. Though the ruinous approach of competitors led to many indigenous enterprises foundling not the least helped with the dominance of sole proprietorships, Blaize thrived in the midst of strong competition and became one of the wealthiest West Africans of his time.Mark R. Lipschutz, R. Kent Rasmussen. Dictionary of African Historical Biography, Aldine Pub. Co., 1978, p. 32. . He was included in the European Lagos Chamber of Commerce constituted in 1888 and was on the 1898 Commission on Trade in Lagos. Political activism He was a prominent member of the Royal African Society during the second half of the nineteenth century. He was also at various times, a newspaper publisher. He entered the newsprint business in 1880, with the launch of The Lagos Times and Gold Coast Colony Advertiser. The paper brought on Mr Mojola Agbebi, who later became prominent and known for his views on cultural Nationalism.Boniface I. Obichere. Studies in Southern Nigerian History, Routledge, 1982, p. 106, . However, the life of the newspaper was short, it folded in 1884. He was thereafter approached by John Payne Jackson, a Liberian emigrant who wanted to re-invent the Times. After much prodding, Blaize agreed to publish a new rag: the Lagos Weekly Times. Through his newspapers, he took an active part in demanding more education, better representation for Africans in Lagos, self-government, and pushed for a separation of Lagos Colony from the Gold Coast Colony. Blaize's political clout in Lagos Colony was demonstrated in 1901 during the contest for the Lagos Throne. After Governor William MacGregor refused to accept any of the rival candidates (Oduntan and Ajose Dawudu) for the Obaship, one of the king- makers (Yesufu Omo-Oba) introduced Eshugbayi Eleko to Blaize, and Blaize in turn introduced Eshugbayi Eleko to Governor MacGregor, who recognized Eleko as Oba of Lagos. Private life Blaize married Emily Cole in 1871 and the couple had 6 children including Charlotte Olajumoke, who in 1902, married Dr. Orisadipe Obasa. Emily Cole died in 1895. Death, legacy and philanthropy In the 1890s Blaize's financial worth was estimated to be about ¬£150,000. Blaize donated ¬£500 in memory of Mary Kingsley to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. When he died in 1904, he bequeathed ¬£3,000 for the foundation of the Blaize Memorial Institute in Abeokuta, which opened in 1909 and functioned well into the 1970s. Blaize kept his connection with Freetown, his place of birth, bequeathing ¬£500 to the Princess Christian Hospital there. Blaize left an estate valued at ¬£60,000 to his children. One of his descendants is Nigerian make-up artist Lola Maja.

It was built in 1913 on a site that had been the First Christian Church of Louisville. It was commissioned by local businessman John Starks Rodes and designed by the Daniel Burnham firm of Chicago. It is tall (62 m). It was listed as the 11th largest office complex in Louisville in 2004 by the newspaper Business First. It was built in the Chicago School of architecture with Beaux Arts details. Cream- colored bricks are one of its signature features. It is decorated with classical motifs, including acanthus leaves, lion's heads and urns. It was originally a \\"U\\" shaped structure, but a 1926 addition designed by the firm Graham, Anderson, Probst & White added a new wing to create a rectangular shape with a central sunlight well. At the bottom of the central atrium was a courtyard, and until 1984 it was covered with a Plexiglas skylight. Main entrance and detail of stonework In 1953, the building was renovated to add a parking garage - the first in the city - to the building. The 700+ space garage was built on an adjoining lot and fronts Third Street. The Starks Building is mixed use, with retail, dining and office space. When it was sold in 1997 the building included about of leasable space. In the 1990s and 2000s the owners had trouble finding tenants, with over half of the space vacant in 2006. Notable long-time tenants include the Colonnade Cafeteria, Seng Jewelers and Rodes Men's and Women's Clothing. Current tenants include the Business First of Louisville news publication, FoodCare, a startup that relocated its headquarters to Louisville from San Francisco in April 2012, and Mediaura, a highly successful digital agency. Colonnade Cafeteria moved into the Starks Building basement in 1926 and remained until 2006. Rodes Clothing, founded by the building's financier John Starks Rodes himself, was located in the building from 1914 until the company relocated to the suburbs in 2004. It was owned by the Starks family until the mid-1980s when it was sold to an investment group, which resold the building in 1997 to Empire State Collateral. Empire State defaulted on the mortgage and ownership was taken over by Allstate in 2004. The building was sold again in 2006 to the Hertz Investment Group. The Starks Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It is connected by a skyway to Fourth Street Live!, an entertainment mall adjacent on the North side. On July 2, 2007, the Cordish Company, developers of Fourth Street Live!, announced that it would expand the mall southward by leasing the first floor (street-level) of the Starks Building.

Since the purchase in 2006, occupancy has risen to 71 percent, as of May 2010, Hertz Investment Group said.

Vaughan. The storyarc would be reprinted in trade paperback under the publication of Dark Horse Comics on June 4, 2008. Plot Part I (Issue #6) Faith sits atop the Art Deco Hope Memorial Bridge in Cleveland, smoking. After somewhat cynically reminiscing that her mother used to read Oh, The Places You'll Go! to her as a child, she receives a telephone call from Robin Wood. Wood and his \\"squad\\" are taking care of a vampire nest, but he tells Faith that one of the vampires they staked used to be a single mother and asks Faith to go check on the children. Faith arrives at the dead woman's house and finds six children, all vampires. After quickly dusting them, she heads back to her apartment. She finds Rupert Giles waiting for her and drinking tea. Giles needs Faith for a dangerous mission with high stakes. If she succeeds, he will give her a passport to anywhere, with a new name and an early retirement. Faith agrees, and finds out Giles wants her to kill a rogue Slayer for whom there is no hope of rehabilitation. Giles trains a reluctant Faith to pass as an English aristocrat, so that she can crash Lady Genevieve's 19th birthday party and assassinate her. In Scotland, Buffy and Xander are training. After Buffy questions him, Xander states that he needs to train so he can be Renee's sparring partner. After Buffy makes fun of his love interest, she stares blankly at the symbol of twilight from the first arc. Buffy confides that she has a recurring nightmare in which a monster says, \\"The Queen is dead. Long live the Queen\\" and then devours her. Now in England, Faith dresses for the party while Giles gives her a last-minute quiz in etiquette. Faith appears at the top of the stairs in an elegant gown, ready to leave for the party, and asks Giles if things are all right, to which Giles responds that things are \\"five by five.\\" Part II (Issue #7) Faith has a flashback of her battle with Buffy (\\"Graduation Day\\"). In the present, Faith has arrived at Genevieve's party, with a knife concealed in her hair. She hears Giles through an earbud, but throws it away, saying, \\"I've got enough voices in my head already.\\" When Faith is inside, she pulls the knife from her hair, ready to attack Genevieve. Faith wonders why she is so nervous about this, when she has killed people before. Meanwhile, Genevieve's steward, Roden, watches over the party, and speaks to some of his flying gargoyles, telling them to be wary of the fourth person in Genevieve's receiving line: Faith. In Scotland, Dawn and Willow have a conversation, and it turns around to the subject of Kenny, with whom everyone thinks Dawn had sex. Despite Willow's attempts to cheer up Dawn, she cries a little and is about to open up to Willow, when Renee brings the message that Buffy needs Willow's advice on computer security. Later, Faith is outside Genevieve's house, smoking a cigarette and seems to be experiencing trepidations about her assignment. However Faith is determined to go back in and kill Genevieve once she has finished smoking. Genevieve startles Faith, who introduces herself as Hope Lyonne, daughter of the Viscount Avalon. As they chat about life and family, Faith slowly draws out the knife from her hair. Suddenly, Faith is lifted off her feet by Roden's flying gargoyles. She climbs onto one and sends it crashing to the ground. After disposing of the other, she faints. In Genevieve's room, she and Roden argue whether or not to kill the unconscious Faith. Genevieve doesn't want to and thinks Faith would be a great asset as a partner. Faith wakes up and talks to Genevieve. When Genevieve mentions that she wants to overtake the queen, Faith asks if Genevieve is going to kill the current queen of Britain. Genevieve opens her closet, which is filled with pictures of Buffy, the symbol of Twilight marked on one of them, and says, \\"No, Hope. Not Elizabeth.\\" Part III (Issue #8) After discovering Genevieve is planning to kill Buffy, Faith jumps to the conclusion that Giles sent her to save Buffy from Genevieve. Nevertheless, she continues her assignment, and convinces Genevieve that she has sided with her. They immediately start bonding, even taking a bath together. Outside the Savidge Manor, Giles along with a freelancer is trying to break into the manor to rescue Faith. The freelancer suggests that Faith has gone \\"native\\", and she's not working for Giles anymore. In Scotland, Buffy and Willow are fixing up some of the force fields around the arena and discussing how they should respond to the danger posed by the army. Genevieve and Roden teleport Buffy to their stately home. Buffy and Genevieve fight, while Faith watches from a balcony. While the rogue Slayer proves to be an accomplished fighter, she is defeated by the more experienced Buffy. As Buffy is about to deliver the killing blow, and Roden prepares to attack Buffy with magic, Faith leaps into the fight. Buffy accuses her of switching sides again, despite Faith's attempts to convince her otherwise. Buffy attacks Faith, and during the ensuing battle, Faith almost drowns Buffy in a swimming pool, but comes to her senses in time. At that moment, Willow teleports Buffy back to Scotland, leaving Faith alone and shaken. While Buffy orders Willow to contact Giles immediately, back at the Savidge residence, Faith sits crestfallen as Genevieve approaches and prepares to swing an axe at her head, realizing that her friend has betrayed her... Part IV (Issue #9) A flashback to a scene in Buffy the Vampire Slayer's third season, between the Mayor and Faith, shows how Faith currently views the Mayor. She knows he was wrong and evil, yet how she can't help but feel loved when she thinks of him. Once the flashback ends, Genevieve and Faith start to fight. Faith tries to make Genevieve understand that Roden is wrong and is steering her in the wrong direction, but Genevieve refuses to listen. Outside Savidge Manor, Giles and the freelancer are still trying to break in to the grounds. Giles talks to Willow and Buffy. Willow adds her magic to his task; Buffy conveys she is angry with him for recent incidents. Back in the greenhouse, Faith and Genevieve are still fighting. Faith mortally wounds her opponent in self-defense and begs Roden to heal her. He tries to recruit her instead, an offer she turns down. Roden attacks, only to be slain by Giles. The following morning, Faith and Giles discuss the situation and agree to be 'social workers' for rogue Slayers, especially considering Buffy is mad at both of them. Somewhere on top of a plateau a woman named Lieutenant Molter talks to a floating figure called Twilight. He states Roden and Gigi's deaths were part of a plan and Buffy will die soon enough. Production Joss Whedon and Brian K. Vaughan collaborated in breaking down the story, before Vaughan penned the four-part story individually.Stakes and Salvation: An Interview with Scott Allie. Vaughan had previously pitched the broad strokes of the story at a dinner with Whedon, Tim Minear and Drew Goddard as a direct-to-DVD Faith movie. There were some presumptions that Vaughan would have difficulty writing the characters' dialogue, given that he wasn't a member of the TV series' writing staff. Despite so, Vaughan proved otherwise. Whedon himself was compelled to tell Vaughan what great lines he had written to Faith specifically. His writing, like the series', featured numerous pop-culture references. The title itself refers to a verse from the song \\"God Save the Queen\\" by the Sex Pistols. Other rock song lyrics are mentioned by characters as well: Faith tells Giles she's \\"the go-to girl for dirty deeds done dirt cheap,\\" whereas Roden paraphrases Pink Floyd's song \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" with the phrase \\"as a wise man once said, you can't have any pudding if you don't eat your meat.\\" Giles, sporting a jumper with a Yellow Submarine design, refers to \\"the great bearded wizard of Northampton\\": a nod to legendary comic book writer and magician Alan Moore. Buffy refers to Lady Genevieve and her accomplices as Faith's 'droogs', a term used in Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange to define friend or associate. Finally, whilst training, Xander makes reference to Snake Plissken, the eye-patch wearing anti-hero of Escape from New York, as well as Captain Ron, another eyepatch-wearing character played by Kurt Russell. Georges Jeanty returned since penciling the first four issues. He too included pop-culture references in the artwork, such as Giles' jumper. He humorously penciled the Tenth Doctor and Rose Tyler from British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Jeanty also references to past Buffy episodes, such as Xander's Sunnydale High School's swim team T-shirt; Xander had previously joined the swim team to investigate the deaths of some of its members in season two. In a flashback sequence in \\"No Future for You, Part II\\", Jeanty replicated the scene from \\"Graduation Day\\". He detailed the panels to the televised episode with such detail including Buffy and Faith's blocking. Canonical issues This series has been described as canon by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of Buffy, Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since this story is part of the larger canonical Season Eight plotted by Whedon, it is considered to continue from the official continuity established by Buffy and Angel. Season Eight contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as Queen of the Slayers and Dark Congress, which are described by their writer Christopher Golden as being set in an unofficial \\"parallel\\" continuity.Mata, Shiai, \\"CHRISTOPHER GOLDEN INTERVIEW 2 \\", SlayerLit.us (2007).

The exoplanet was found by using the radial velocity method, from radial-velocity measurements via observation of Doppler shifts in the spectrum of the planet's parent star. It was the first planet discovered orbiting a giant star. Name Following its discovery the planet was designated Iota Draconis b. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars. IAU.org. 9 July 2014 The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.NameExoWorlds The Process In December 2015, the IAU announced that the winning name for this planet was Hypatia.Final Results of NameExoWorlds Public Vote Released, International Astronomical Union, 15 December 2015. The winning name was submitted by Hypatia, a student society of the Physics Faculty of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain. Hypatia was a famous Greek astronomer, mathematician, and philosopher.NameExoWorlds The Approved Names  Characteristics  Mass, radius and temperature Iota Draconis b is a \\"super-Jupiter\\" a planet that has mass larger than that of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. It has a blackbody temperature of . It has an estimated mass of around 8.82 and a potential radius of around 12 based on its mass, since it is more massive than Jupiter. Host star The planet orbits a (K-type) giant star named Iota Draconis. The star has exhausted the hydrogen supply in its core and is currently fusing helium. The star has a mass of 1.82 and a radius of around 12 . It has a surface temperature of 4545 K and is around 800 million years old based on its evolution. Although much younger than the Sun, the higher mass of this star correlates to a faster evolution, leading to the host star having already departed from the main sequence. When on the main sequence, Iota Draconis was probably a Class A star with surface temperature between 7,400-10,000K. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, a measure of how bright it appears from Earth, is 3.31. Therefore, Iota Draconis can be seen with the naked eye.  Orbit  Iota Draconis b orbits its star with nearly 55 times the Sun's luminosity (55 ) every 511 days at an average distance of 1.275 AU (compared to Mars' orbital distance from the Sun, which is 1.52 AU) It has a very eccentric orbit, with an eccentricity of 0.7124.  Discovery  Discovered in 2002 during a radial velocity study of K-class giant stars, its eccentric orbit aided its detection, as giant stars have pulsations which can mimic the presence of a planet.

It was used almost exclusively as a cross-country flying, gunnery, photographic and radio trainer. The O-17 had a removable fairing (carrying a Scarff ring mounting for one .30 cal (7.62 mm) trainable Browning machine gun}. The Royal Canadian Air Force purchased three generally similar aircraft, two Model 7 landplanes and one Model 8 floatplane, the latter with the same float gear as the NY series.

Rear view of a BD-4 taildragger The Bede BD-4 is an American light aircraft, designed by Jim Bede for homebuilding and available since 1968. It was the first homebuilt aircraft to be offered in kit form.The TEAM Aviation BD-4 It remains one of the world's most popular homebuilts with thousands of plans sold and hundreds of examples completed to date. Design and development Tubular spar of a BD-4C Based on his previous work with innovative light aircraft, the BD-1 (eventually developed into the American Aviation AA-1 Yankee) and BD-2, Jim Bede designed the BD-4 to be the first real \\"kitplane\\" in the world. The design was based on a high-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design, able to be fitted either with a tailwheel or a tricycle undercarriage. When building the plane, it was also possible to choose between a two-seat or four-seat version. The intention was to allow people with little or no fabrication experience to start with a set of comprehensive plans and work up to a bolt-together operation in which complex components were provided from the factory. In order to simplify construction, there were few curved surfaces and most of the fuselage was made up of flat aluminum sheeting. The only major components with compound curves were the engine cowling and landing gear spats, which were made of fiberglass. The fuselage was constructed of aluminum angle braces bolted together to form a truss frame. An innovative feature of the BD-4 was the wing structure, which employed a 'panel-rib' constructed in sections, consisting of a rib whose upper edge was extended horizontally to become one section of the wing surface. The wing was progressively built up by sliding these sections together over the tubular spar and fastening them together where they met. One downside to the panel-rib construction was not noticed until the aircraft had been in service for some time. Because the panels were glued together, they formed a liquid-tight bond, unlike conventional systems using rivets. Instead of using a separate tank to hold fuel, builders simply drilled holes in the ribs to interconnect the sections to form a tank. In service, it was found that leaks inevitably developed due to problems like improper seals and natural flexing of the wing. BedeCorp later redesigned the wing to use a more conventional system with separate fuel tanks in the BD-4C. Although the original wing design was easy to build, the more recent BD-4B features a redesigned, more conventional, metal wing with a tubular spar bonded to honeycomb ribs.Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 97. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011.

It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Razzaq. The name means \\"servant of the all-provider\\", Ar-RazzƒÅq being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names. The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. Because the letter r is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Razzaq, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd ar-Razzaq. Alternative transliterations include ‚ÄòAbd ar-Razzaq, Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Razaq, Abdul Razzak and others, all subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.

It is located between, and connected to, the university's Old Engineering Hall and Space Research Coordination Center (SRCC) along O'Hara Street in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh. History and use The design for Thaw Hall came from Henry Hornbostel's winning submission, termed the \\"Acropolis Plan\\", for a 1907 national competition to design a new campus for the University of Pittsburgh which was moving from its Observatory Hill campus to its current location in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. Hornbostel's plan was begun in 1908 with the construction of the now demolished School of Mines, later renamed State Hall. State Hall's construction was closely followed by the laying of the cornerstone for what was originally termed the Engineering Building in 1909. Construction on the Engineering Building was completed in 1910, and its dedication took place on June 15 of that year, at which time it was renamed in honor of Pitt trustee and benefactor Benjamin Thaw, Sr., who donated a substantial amount toward the building's construction. Only a few other buildings in the Acropolis Plan design were constructed, including the original Pennsylvania Hall in 1911 as well as the Mineral Industries Building in 1912. However, Thaw Hall is the only surviving building of Hornbostel's original concept, as well as the oldest building on Pitt's Oakland campus that was originally constructed for academic purposes. Originally home to Pitt's School of Engineering, it is now the secondary home to its Department of Physics and Astronomy, and the location of the Physics department's Resource Room, a student help center.Resource Room, Physics & Astronomy, University of PIttsburgh, accessdate=2008-08-24 Several other departments, including Asian Languages, Chemistry, and Archaeology, have offices, classrooms, and labs in various locations throughout the building. It additionally is the home of the Architectural Studies Program's \\"architecture lab\\" which, following its dedication in the spring of 2007, serves as a dedicated design studio space that accommodates a two-semester architectural studio sequence that facilitates intensive instruction from practicing architects in the fundamentals of spatial thinking, graphic representation techniques, and model building.History of Art & Architecture, University of Pittsburgh, accessdate=2008-11-10 The Office of Experiential Learning, Freshman Programs, and the Writing Center were all previously located in this building. Renovations, upgrades, and improvements for Thaw Hall, Old Engineering Hall, and Allen Hall have been announced and are preliminarily targeted in to be in excess of $58.6 million according to the University's 12-year facilities master plan.University of Pittsburgh Announces 12-Year Facilities Plan To Support Programmatic Direction, News From Pitt, University of Pittsburgh, May 14, 2007, accessdate=2008-08-24 University of Pittsburgh Facilities Plan: 2007-2018, May 14, 2007; University of Pittsburgh, accessdate=2008-08-24 Architectural elements The only surviving building of the \\"Acropolis Plan\\" seen here relatively new about 1910 According to architectural historian Christopher Drew Armstrong, the five story stone, brick, and terra cotta building contains motifs from classical elements that are \\"specifically derived from Greek models...but not constrained by them\\" and that are \\"derived from the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where Hornbostel trained.\\" Thaw Hall was intended as a gatepost or supporting building in the never realized \\"Acropolis Plan\\" for Pitt's campus, and was designed to work with additional proposed, but never realized, buildings. This is evidenced by the west end of the building that went unfinished with the expectation that construction would continue along in that direction, but was only subsequently connected to the university's newer engineering facility (now termed \\"Old Engineering Hall\\") in 1955.The Owl, 1956, pg15 According to Armstrong, Hornbostel used a balcony- like element to set back the upper part of the building so the lower levels could act as a podium in order to \\"give a horizontal continuity to a chain of buildings that were planned\\". General motifs repeated in Thaw Hall's facade include recessed bricks within larger brick columns, as well as deeply recessed windows that are trimmed by decorative brick patterns that vary by floor. The details of the building include ornamental elements reflective of classical design including Doric columns as well as cornice and pediment containing repeating classical terra cotta decorative patterns incorporating waves, palmettes, or leaves, as well as granite rosettes and Greek Key motifs. The words \\"School of Engineering‚Äù is sculpted into the O‚ÄôHara Street side of the building above two unfinished stone elements that may have been intended to be sculpted into portraits had the Hornbostel campus plan been fully executed. Armstrong contends that Thaw Hall's worth as a historic building is demonstrated in Hornbostel's intentional manipulation of effects of light and shadow by the application of varying amounts of relief to the ornamentation in order to create alternate dark and light patterns that are still observable from a distance, while abating the effect as the viewer looks at the lower parts of the building. The building has several odd architectural elements. Due to an odd numbering decision, there is a sub-basement, a basement and a mezzanine, in ascending order, all of which are above ground, the later two having windowed rooms, with the first floor roughly level with Old Engineering Hall's second floor. There is a back corridor on the Mezzanine level (2 stories above ground level), currently housing the architecture lab, which can only be accessed by elevator or by walking through one of the classrooms (Thaw 11), passing directly in front of the blackboard at the lecturer's level. The Basement level has only a single entrance, located in a recessed door on the stairs leading from the Mezzanine level into SRCC; a single exit, a glass vestibule leading into the OEH vehicle turnaround; and an elevator door located inside an office space, which is locked off to external access. The basement level currently houses the Pittsburgh Quantum Institute, a multidisciplinary research institute that focuses on quantum sciences and engineering in the Pittsburgh region. Space Research Coordination Center The Space Research Coordination Center is attached to the former main entrance to Thaw Hall The Space Research Coordination Center (SRCC), sometimes referred to as the Space Research Coordinating Center, was completed in 1965 from funding obtained from a $1.5 million NASA grant for studies in the natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, and health areas concerned with the aerospace field. The SRCC was constructed as an annex connected to the eastern side of Thaw Hall. The addition includes a common entrance on O‚ÄôHara Street for both the SRCC and Thaw Hall that obscured the original Thaw Hall entrance which contained two large Doric columns, ornamentation, and wrought-iron gates. Because of this, a ground level side-door accessible via the basement of Old Engineering Hall is the only direct exterior access to Thaw Hall, with all other access via internal connections from Old Engineering Hall or SRCC. The third floor of the SRCC is connected to the Mezzanine floor (of the basement level which is the second floor above ground level) of Thaw Hall at Thaw Hall's original entrance. The design of SRCC in mimics Thaw Hall in the color of the brick and the motif of recessed bricks in the middle of larger brick columns, but contains a flat roof and is absent of ornamentation. Today, the SRCC houses the university's Department of Geology and Planetary Science as well as offices from other departments including the Department of Physics & Astronomy.

The plants in this image, and the algae and phytoplankton in the lake, are primary producers. They take nutrients from the soil or the water, and manufacture their own food by photosynthesis, using energy from the sun. The trophic level of an organism is the position it occupies in a food web. A food chain is a succession of organisms that eat other organisms and may, in turn, be eaten themselves. The trophic level of an organism is the number of steps it is from the start of the chain. A food web starts at trophic level 1 with primary producers such as plants, can move to herbivores at level 2, carnivores at level 3 or higher, and typically finish with apex predators at level 4 or 5. The path along the chain can form either a one-way flow or a food \\"web\\". Ecological communities with higher biodiversity form more complex trophic paths. The word trophic derives from the Greek œÑœÅŒøœÜŒÆ (trophƒì) referring to food or nourishment. History The concept of trophic level was developed by Raymond Lindeman (1942), based on the terminology of August Thienemann (1926): \\"producers\\", \\"consumers\\" and \\"reducers\\" (modified to \\"decomposers\\" by Lindeman).Lindeman, R. L. (1942). The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology. Ecology 23: 399‚Äì418. link.Thienemann, A. 1926. Der Nahrungskreislauf im Wasser. Verh. deutsch. Zool. Ges., 31: 29-79, link. [Also at: Zool. Anz. Suppl., 2: 29-79.] Overview Consumer categories based on material eaten (plant: green shades are live, brown shades are dead; animal: red shades are live, purple shades are dead; or particulate: grey shades) and feeding strategy (gatherer: lighter shade of each color; miner: darker shade of each color) The three basic ways in which organisms get food are as producers, consumers, and decomposers. * Producers (autotrophs) are typically plants or algae. Plants and algae do not usually eat other organisms, but pull nutrients from the soil or the ocean and manufacture their own food using photosynthesis. For this reason, they are called primary producers. In this way, it is energy from the sun that usually powers the base of the food chain. An exception occurs in deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems, where there is no sunlight. Here primary producers manufacture food through a process called chemosynthesis. * Consumers (heterotrophs) are species that cannot manufacture their own food and need to consume other organisms. Animals that eat primary producers (like plants) are called herbivores. Animals that eat other animals are called carnivores, and animals that eat both plants and other animals are called omnivores. * Decomposers (detritivores) break down dead plant and animal material and wastes and release it again as energy and nutrients into the ecosystem for recycling. Decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi (mushrooms), feed on waste and dead matter, converting it into inorganic chemicals that can be recycled as mineral nutrients for plants to use again. Trophic levels can be represented by numbers, starting at level 1 with plants. Further trophic levels are numbered subsequently according to how far the organism is along the food chain. * Level 1: Plants and algae make their own food and are called producers. * Level 2: Herbivores eat plants and are called primary consumers. * Level 3: Carnivores that eat herbivores are called secondary consumers. * Level 4: Carnivores that eat other carnivores are called tertiary consumers. * Apex predators by definition have no predators and are at the top of their food web. File:Sylvilagus floridanus.jpg|Second trophic level Rabbits eat plants at the first trophic level, so they are primary consumers. File:Vulpes_vulpes_with_prey.jpg|Third trophic level Foxes eat rabbits at the second trophic level, so they are secondary consumers. File:Aquila_chrysaetos_1_(Bohu≈°_ƒå√≠ƒçel).jpg|Fourth trophic level Golden eagles eat foxes at the third trophic level, so they are tertiary consumers. File:Fungi in Borneo.jpg|Decomposers The fungi on this tree feed on dead matter, converting it back to nutrients that primary producers can use. In real-world ecosystems, there is more than one food chain for most organisms, since most organisms eat more than one kind of food or are eaten by more than one type of predator. A diagram that sets out the intricate network of intersecting and overlapping food chains for an ecosystem is called its food web. Decomposers are often left off food webs, but if included, they mark the end of a food chain. Thus food chains start with primary producers and end with decay and decomposers. Since decomposers recycle nutrients, leaving them so they can be reused by primary producers, they are sometimes regarded as occupying their own trophic level. The trophic level of a species may vary if it has a choice of diet. Virtually all plants and phytoplankton are purely phototrophic and are at exactly level 1.0. Many worms are at around 2.1; insects 2.2; jellyfish 3.0; birds 3.6.Biodiversity and Morphology: Table 3.5 in Fish on line, Version 3, August 2014. FishBase A 2013 study estimates the average trophic level of human beings at 2.21, similar to pigs or anchovies. This is only an average, and plainly both modern and ancient human eating habits are complex and vary greatly. For example, a traditional Eskimo living on a diet consisting primarily of seals would have a trophic level of nearly 5. Biomass transfer efficiency An energy pyramid illustrates how much energy is needed as it flows upward to support the next trophic level. Only about 10% of the energy transferred between each trophic level is converted to biomass. In general, each trophic level relates to the one below it by absorbing some of the energy it consumes, and in this way can be regarded as resting on, or supported by, the next lower trophic level. Food chains can be diagrammed to illustrate the amount of energy that moves from one feeding level to the next in a food chain. This is called an energy pyramid. The energy transferred between levels can also be thought of as approximating to a transfer in biomass, so energy pyramids can also be viewed as biomass pyramids, picturing the amount of biomass that results at higher levels from biomass consumed at lower levels. However, when primary producers grow rapidly and are consumed rapidly, the biomass at any one moment may be low; for example, phytoplankton (producer) biomass can be low compared to the zooplankton (consumer) biomass in the same area of ocean. The efficiency with which energy or biomass is transferred from one trophic level to the next is called the ecological efficiency. Consumers at each level convert on average only about 10% of the chemical energy in their food to their own organic tissue (the ten-percent law). For this reason, food chains rarely extend for more than 5 or 6 levels. At the lowest trophic level (the bottom of the food chain), plants convert about 1% of the sunlight they receive into chemical energy. It follows from this that the total energy originally present in the incident sunlight that is finally embodied in a tertiary consumer is about 0.001% Evolution Both the number of trophic levels and the complexity of relationships between them evolve as life diversifies through time, the exception being intermittent mass extinction events. Fractional trophic levels Killer whales (orca) are apex predators but they are divided into separate populations that hunt specific prey, such as tuna, small sharks, and seals. Food webs largely define ecosystems, and the trophic levels define the position of organisms within the webs. But these trophic levels are not always simple integers, because organisms often feed at more than one trophic level.Odum, W. E.; Heald, E. J. (1975) \\"The detritus-based food web of an estuarine mangrove community\\". Pages 265‚Äì286 in L. E. Cronin, ed. Estuarine research. Vol. 1. Academic Press, New York. For example, some carnivores also eat plants, and some plants are carnivores. A large carnivore may eat both smaller carnivores and herbivores; the bobcat eats rabbits, but the mountain lion eats both bobcats and rabbits. Animals can also eat each other; the bullfrog eats crayfish and crayfish eat young bullfrogs. The feeding habits of a juvenile animal, and, as a consequence, its trophic level, can change as it grows up. The fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly sets the values of trophic levels to one in plants and detritus, two in herbivores and detritivores (primary consumers), three in secondary consumers, and so on. The definition of the trophic level, TL, for any consumer species is: :: TL_i=1 + \\\\sum_j (TL_j \\\\cdot DC_{ij})\\\\\\\\! where TL_j is the fractional trophic level of the prey j, and DC_{ij} represents the fraction of j in the diet of i. In the case of marine ecosystems, the trophic level of most fish and other marine consumers takes a value between 2.0 and 5.0. The upper value, 5.0, is unusual, even for large fish, though it occurs in apex predators of marine mammals, such as polar bears and killer whales. In addition to observational studies of animal behavior, and quantification of animal stomach contents, trophic level can be quantified through stable isotope analysis of animal tissues such as muscle, skin, hair, bone collagen. This is because there is a consistent increase in the nitrogen isotopic composition at each trophic level caused by fractionations that occur with the synthesis of biomolecules; the magnitude of this increase in nitrogen isotopic composition is approximately 3‚Äì4‚Ä∞. Mean trophic level The mean trophic level of the world fisheries catch has steadily declined because many high trophic level fish, such as this tuna, have been overfished In fisheries, the mean trophic level for the fisheries catch across an entire area or ecosystem is calculated for year y as: :: TL_y=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_i (TL_i \\\\cdot Y_{iy})}{\\\\sum_i Y_{iy}} where Y_{iy} is the catch of the species or group i in year y, and TL_i is the trophic level for species i as defined above. Fish at higher trophic levels usually have a higher economic value, which can result in overfishing at the higher trophic levels. Earlier reports found precipitous declines in mean trophic level of fisheries catch, in a process known as fishing down the food web. However, more recent work finds no relation between economic value and trophic level; and that mean trophic levels in catches, surveys and stock assessments have not in fact declined, suggesting that fishing down the food web is not a global phenomenon. However Pauly et al. note that trophic levels peaked at 3.4 in 1970 in the northwest and west-central Atlantic, followed by a subsequent decline to 2.9 in 1994. They report a shift away from long-lived, piscivorous, high-trophic-level bottom fishes, such as cod and haddock, to short-lived, planktivorous, low-trophic-level invertebrates (e.g., shrimps) and small, pelagic fish (e.g., herrings). This shift from high-trophic-level fishes to low-trophic-level invertebrates and fishes is a response to changes in the relative abundance of the preferred catch. They argue this is part of the global fishery collapse. Humans have a mean trophic level of about 2.21, about the same as a pig or an anchovy.\\"Researchers calculate human trophic level for first time\\" Phys.org . 3 December 2013.Bonhommeau, S., Dubroca, L., Le Pape, O., Barde, J., Kaplan, D.M., Chassot, E. and Nieblas, A.E.

FiB index Since biomass transfer efficiencies are only about 10%, it follows that the rate of biological production is much greater at lower trophic levels than it is at higher levels. Fisheries catch, at least, to begin with, will tend to increase as the trophic level declines. At this point the fisheries will target species lower in the food web. In 2000, this led Pauly and others to construct a \\"Fisheries in Balance\\" index, usually called the FiB index. The FiB index is defined, for any year y, by :: FiB_y=\\\\log\\\\frac{Y_y/(TE)^{TL_y}}{Y_0/(TE)^{TL_0}} where Y_y is the catch at year y, {TL}_y is the mean trophic level of the catch at year y, Y_0 is the catch, {TL}_0 the mean trophic level of the catch at the start of the series being analyzed, and TE is the transfer efficiency of biomass or energy between trophic levels. The FiB index is stable (zero) over periods of time when changes in trophic levels are matched by appropriate changes in the catch in the opposite direction. The index increases if catches increase for any reason, e.g. higher fish biomass, or geographic expansion. Such decreases explain the \\"backward-bending\\" plots of trophic level versus catch originally observed by Pauly and others in 1998. Tritrophic and other interactions One aspect of trophic levels is called tritrophic interaction. Ecologists often restrict their research to two trophic levels as a way of simplifying the analysis; however, this can be misleading if tritrophic interactions (such as plant‚Äìherbivore‚Äìpredator) are not easily understood by simply adding pairwise interactions (plant-herbivore plus herbivore‚Äìpredator, for example). Significant interactions can occur between the first trophic level (plant) and the third trophic level (a predator) in determining herbivore population growth, for example. Simple genetic changes may yield morphological variants in plants that then differ in their resistance to herbivores because of the effects of the plant architecture on enemies of the herbivore. Plants can also develop defenses against herbivores such as chemical defenses.

He later played minor counties cricket, as well as making two List A appearances, for Herefordshire. In 2018, he returned to Worcestershire as chief executive. Rawnsley spent his Worcestershire playing career on the fringes of the first team, only rarely getting a lengthy run in the side. Comfortably his most significant season was 2001, when he played 15 first- class and 21 List A games. In that season, he took 27 first-class wickets ‚Äì albeit at an expensive average of 44.85 ‚Äì and 21 List A wickets at 34.19; in both cases, these were the highest season's aggregates of his career. However, Rawnsley's best individual bowling performances came in other years. His first-class career best of 6‚Äì44 was achieved in the second innings against Oxford University at The University Parks in 1998; he also claimed 5‚Äì72 in the first innings to pick up his only ten-wicket match haul. His best one-day performance of 5‚Äì26 came in a National League game against Kent at Tunbridge Wells. In general, Rawnsley was not a particularly accomplished batsman: in first-class cricket he never reached 40, although he did score a century for Worcestershire's Second XI in 1997. In 25 List A innings he reached double figures only twice, and his highest score for Worcestershire was a mere 12. However, he did contribute with the bat on one of his two List A appearances for Herefordshire: playing against Oxfordshire in the C&G; Trophy at Bodicote.

During the years 2002-2005 he published a series of papers (thirteen first-authored, seventeen co- authored) on the density structure and global dynamics of the plasmasphere. In addition to covering fundamental scientific aspects of plasmaspheric dynamics, Goldstein's research has brought attention to plasmaspheric influence on space weather, i.e., space-based phenomena that affect human activities and society. For example, when so-called \\"space storms\\" (otherwise known as geomagnetic storms) strike, they erode away the outer layers of the plasmasphere, and this erosion produces significant space weather effects in the form of increased radiation hazards for satellites and astronauts, and range errors in GPS navigation signals. Goldstein got his B.S. at Brooklyn College and his Ph.D at Dartmouth College, where he studied magnetospheric cavity mode resonance, a phenomenon in which the Earth's magnetic field traps electromagnetic waves. As a postdoc at Rice University (2000-2003), Goldstein‚Äôs job was to interpret and model the brand-new space weather data being obtained by the IMAGE satellite (launched in March 2000). During his stay at Rice, he also participated in public outreach and education, working with inner city high school algebra teachers to develop space physics problems for use in the classroom, and designing and teaching an eight-week Continuing Studies course in space physics. At the Southwest Research Institute (after 2003), Goldstein continued his research on the inner magnetosphere of Earth. He also participated in analysis of Cassini data being returned from Saturn‚Äôs magnetosphere, taught graduate-level courses as an adjoint professor of U.T. San Antonio, and led the science operations center for the TWINS. In 2006, Goldstein received several notes of recognition for his research. He was awarded the 2006 American Geophysical Union (AGU) Macelwane medal and granted the status of AGU Fellow.

Established in 1908, THS is the oldest of the high schools in the Taree area, servicing Taree and the Manning Valley area, and the school enrolled approximately 880 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom 18 percent identified as Indigenous Australians and three percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education; and the executive principal is Allison Alliston.  Overview  The school is equipped with specialist facilities and works closely with local primary schools, the business community and Taree TAFE. A semesterised curriculum is used at the school, providing a variety of subjects and units. In 2013 Taree High School and Taree Public School became part of the Connected Communities Strategy.http://www.dec.nsw.gov.au/about-the-department/our-reforms/connected- communities This strategy aims to provide tailored programs to improve educational outcomes for Aboriginal students and their families across New South Wales. THS's motto is Flumen Coronent Filii, Latin for \\"May your sons and daughters crown the river\\", referring to the Manning River, a feature of the town of Taree. School facilities include a library, full-size gymnasium, drama room with lighting, sound equipment and stage curtains, canteen, Year 12 outdoor area and common room, school hall, Aboriginal resource room, agricultural farm, and a special education unit. Taree High School's executive principal is Allison Alliston. The deputy principals are Nigel Reece and Raylene Starke. Curriculum Taree High School is a NSW Department of Education school and therefore follows the curriculum for all years developed by the New South Wales Education Standards Authority. The school has implemented a unitised curriculum involving Years 8 to 10, in order to provide students with a wide range of subject choices. As students progress through Years 8 to 10, they are offered a wider number of subject choices. In addition to the mandated, more traditional areas of study, the school offers unique study units such as outdoor education, ceramics and robotics. In their senior years, students are prepared for the NSW Higher School Certificate (HSC) and may study the Board Developed Courses to satisfy requirements. Alternatively, THS offers a Work Studies program involving TAFE study and work placement for those students wishing to enter the workforce upon completion of their high school education. All students have access to vocational education and training (VET) courses through both the school and TAFE. THS also participates in the Senior Curriculum Advantage project, which uses the course offerings at all three Manning Valley High Schools, Chatham, Wingham and Taree, to ensure Year 11 and 12 students can access a broad and relevant curriculum. Senior students may choose to remain at one school only or to access courses at other \\"host\\" school on a Wednesday afternoon in lieu of sport. Students who leave school before receiving their Higher School Certificate (HSC) receive the NSW Record of School Achievement (RoSA). The RoSA records all completed Year 9, 10 and 11 courses and grades, and participation in any uncompleted Year 11 courses. Co-curriculum Community Taree High School students participate in a number of community events throughout the school year. Highlights of the community program include: *The Vampire Shield initiative, that is run annually by the local blood bank. *Students march at the local ANZAC Day parade that is held every year. *SRC representatives join other local schools in discussing issues that affect all students of the local area, at Youth Advisory Committee (YAC) meetings, which are run by Greater Taree City Council.Greater Taree City Council - Greater Taree Youth Advisory Committee *The school participates in NAIDOC (National Aboriginal Islander Day Observance Committee) week events.Greater Taree City Council - NAIDOC The school also caters for exchange students from around the world. Debating Taree High School has three debating teams: a Years 7/8, 9/10, and a senior debating team, which made it to the regional level of the Premier's Debating Challenge NSW. Leadership To encourage leadership skills, THS has a Student Representative Council, made up of the school's captains and representatives from every year group. Each year group elects its representatives annually. School captains are also elected each year by peers and teachers. The school holds an annual ANZAC Day assembly at the school and the captains prepare speeches for this. The SRC representatives organise school socials, write year reports for newsletters, run school assemblies, coordinate out of uniform days to raise money for charities, and help in the canteen to reduce waiting lines. SRC meetings are held weekly. Important issues within the school's agenda are discussed and debated on, with SRC representatives voicing their peers' opinions and ideas.Australia Network - Nexus - English Bites - Taree High Performing arts A music, arts, drama and dance concert, known as MADD, is held every year at the local Manning Entertainment Centre in order to allow students to showcase their talents and perform.Greater Taree City Council Calendar of Events The MADD concert is hosted by the Year 11 Drama students, who film it and sell the videos and DVDs to the school community. Publications The school annually produces a magazine, The Torch, containing student poems, stories, artwork, reports, and other work. Students may purchase the magazine at the end of the year. Sport Students represent Taree High School in various sporting events, and the school encourages them to further their talents in areas such as aerobics, cricket, soccer, volleyball, basketball, tennis, surfing, waterpolo and others. House system As with most Australian schools, Taree High School utilises a house system. The school established four houses in 1935 or 1936, Manning (blue), Murray (purple), Hooke (green) and Peel (red). Through this house system, students annually participate in a swimming carnival, an athletics carnival, a beach day, a Spirit day and cross country events. The four houses are rewarded with points for every participant in each event, and at the completion of each carnival the house with the most points is declared the winner. Initiatives Taree High School has implemented the Positive Behaviour for Learning process, an evidence-based whole-school process to improve learning outcomes for all students. THS's core values are Cooperation, Participation and Respect (CPR). Students can earn CPR Tickets by modelling these expectations and are rewarded with weekly prize draws and House points. Taree High School introduced the Millennium Parent Portal in 2015. The Portal allows the main caregiver of each student to access live attendance feeds, student notices, timetables, academic results and reports, parent/teacher bookings and behavior records with their unique logon. Taree High School posts regularly to social media to keep the Taree community informed of school news and events.  Uniform  Students can wear any uniform piece with any other uniform piece. They are required to wear a gold polo during sport and practical PDHPE classes.

Mobbing in animals is an antipredator adaptation in which individuals of prey species mob a predator by cooperatively attacking or harassing it, usually to protect their offspring. A simple definition of mobbing is an assemblage of individuals around a potentially dangerous predator. This is most frequently seen in birds, though it is also known to occur in many other animals such as the meerkat and some bovines. While mobbing has evolved independently in many species, it only tends to be present in those whose young are frequently preyed upon. This behavior may complement cryptic adaptations in the offspring themselves, such as camouflage and hiding. Mobbing calls may be used to summon nearby individuals to cooperate in the attack. Konrad Lorenz, in his book On Aggression (1966), attributed mobbing among birds and animals to instincts rooted in the Darwinian struggle to survive. In his view, humans are subject to similar innate impulses but capable of bringing them under rational control (see mobbing).Kenneth Westheus Mobbing . uwaterloo.ca In birds A great kiskadee (right) mobbing a hawk Birds that breed in colonies such as gulls are widely seen to attack intruders, including encroaching humans. In North America, the birds that most frequently engage in mobbing include mockingbirds, crows and jays, chickadees, terns, and blackbirds. Behavior includes flying about the intruder, dive bombing, loud squawking and defecating on the predator. Mobbing can also be used to obtain food, by driving larger birds and mammals away from a food source, or by harassing a bird with food. One bird might distract while others quickly steal food. Scavenging birds such as gulls frequently use this technique to steal food from humans nearby. A flock of birds might drive a powerful animal away from food. Costs of mobbing behavior include the risk of engaging with predators, as well as energy expended in the process. The black- headed gull is a species which aggressively engages intruding predators, such as carrion crows. Classic experiments on this species by Hans Kruuk involved placing hen eggs at intervals from a nesting colony, and recording the percentage of successful predation events as well as the probability of the crow being subjected to mobbing. The results showed decreasing mobbing with increased distance from the nest, which was correlated with increased predation success. Mobbing may function by reducing the predator's ability to locate nests (as a distraction) since predators cannot focus on locating eggs while they are under attack. Crows mobbing a perched bald eagle Besides the ability to drive the predator away, mobbing also draws attention to the predator, making stealth attacks impossible. Mobbing plays a critical role in the identification of predators and inter-generational learning about predator identification. Reintroduction of species is often unsuccessful, because the established population lacks this cultural knowledge of how to identify local predators. Scientists are exploring ways to train populations to identify and respond to predators before releasing them into the wild. Adaptationist hypotheses regarding why an organism should engage in such risky behavior have been suggested by Eberhard Curio, including advertising their physical fitness and hence uncatchability (much like stotting behavior in gazelles), distracting predators from finding their offspring, warning their offspring, luring the predator away, allowing offspring to learn to recognize the predator species, directly injuring the predator or attracting a predator of the predator itself. The much lower frequency of attacks between nesting seasons suggests such behavior may have evolved due to its benefit for the mobber's young. Niko Tinbergen argued that the mobbing was a source of confusion to gull chick predators, distracting them from searching for prey . Indeed, an intruding carrion crow can only avoid incoming attacks by facing its attackers, which prevents it from locating its target. Besides experimental research, the comparative method can also be employed to investigate hypotheses such as those given by Curio above. For example, not all gull species show mobbing behavior. The kittiwake nests on sheer cliffs that are almost completely inaccessible to predators, meaning its young are not at risk of predation like other gull species. This is an example of divergent evolution. Looking at variation in the behavioural responses of 22 different passerine species to a potential predator, the Eurasian Pygmy Owl, extent of mobbing was positively related with a species prevalence in the owls' diet. Furthermore, the intensity of mobbing was greater in autumn than spring. Mobbing is thought to carry risks to roosting predators, including potential harm from the mobbing birds, or attracting larger, more dangerous predators. Birds at risk of mobbing such as owls have cryptic plumage and hidden roosts which reduces this danger. In other animals The occurrence of mobbing behavior across widely different taxa, including California ground squirrels, is evidence of convergent evolution. Another way the comparative method can be used here is by comparing gulls with distantly related organisms. This approach relies on the existence of convergent evolution, where distantly related organisms evolve the same trait due to similar selection pressures. As mentioned, many bird species such as the swallows also mob predators, however more distantly related groups including mammals have been known to engage in this behavior. One example is the California ground squirrel, which distracts predators such as the rattlesnake and gopher snake from locating their nest burrows by kicking sand into their face, which disrupts the snake's sensory organs; for crotaline snakes, this includes the heat-detecting organs in the loreal pits. This social species also uses alarm calls. Some fish engage in mobbing; for example, bluegills sometimes attack snapping turtles. Bluegills, which form large nesting colonies, were seen to attack both released and naturally occurring turtles, which may advertise their presence, drive the predator from the area, or aid in the transmission of predator recognition. Similarly, humpback whales are known to mob killer whales when the latter are attacking other species, including other cetacean species, seals, sea lions, and fish. Mobbing calls The great tit (P. major), a passerine bird, employs both mobbing behavior and alarm calls. Mobbing calls are signals made by the mobbing species while harassing a predator. These differ from alarm calls, which allow con-specifics to escape from the predator. The great tit, a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when prey species are in flight, they employ an alarm signal in the 7‚Äì8 kHz range. This call is less effective at traveling great distances, but is much more difficult for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which the call came). In the case of the alarm call, it could be disadvantageous to the sender if the predator picks up on the signal, hence selection has favored those birds able to hear and employ calls in this higher frequency range. Mobbing calls may also be part of an animal's arsenal in harassing the predator. Studies of Phainopepla mobbing calls indicate it may serve to enhance the swooping attack on the predators, including scrub jays. In this species, the mobbing call is smoothly upsweeping, and is made when swooping down in an arc beside the predator. This call was also heard during agonistic behavior interactions with conspecifics, and may serve additionally or alternatively as an alarm call to their mate. Evolution African buffalo herd confronting a lion The evolution of mobbing behavior can be explained using evolutionarily stable strategies, which are in turn based on game theory. Mobbing involves risks (costs) to the individual and benefits (payoffs) to the individual and others. The individuals themselves are often genetically related, and mobbing is increasingly studied with the gene- centered view of evolution by considering inclusive fitness (the carrying on of one's genes through one's family members), rather than merely benefit to the individual. By cooperating to successfully drive away predators, all individuals involved increase their chances of survival and reproduction. An individual stands little chance against a larger predator, but when a large group is involved, the risk to each group member is reduced or diluted. This so-called dilution effect proposed by W. D. Hamilton is another way of explaining the benefits of cooperation by selfish individuals. Lanchester's laws also provide an insight into the advantages of attacking in a large group rather than individually. Another interpretation involves the use of signalling theory, and possibly the handicap principle. Here the idea is that a mobbing bird, by apparently putting itself at risk, displays its status and health so as to be preferred by potential partners.

Her Abenaki name meant \\"Singing Bird\\", but she was also baptised and given the name Mary Agatha. This was most likely pronounced as \\"Molly Agat\\" or \\"Molly Ockett\\" by Abenaki speakers. Biography She was born sometime between 1725 and 1744 and was said to be a daughter of the chief of the Pequaket tribe. She was said to have married a minute man in the Revolutionary War by the name of Edward Marden. They had a child who was named Edward E. Marden Jr., and this is theorized because of the photo of her grandsons Nathaniel Richmond Marden and Chapin Kidder Marden. Nathaniel and Chapin looked to have a lot of physical features a Native American would have. They were both tall, (Nathaniel being 6 ft and 1 in), and having curly hair. This is not confirmed, and may not be true. Molly was reputed to be a skilled healer and wise woman with a singular sense of humor. She is reputed to have saved the life of future Vice President of the United States Hannibal Hamlin when he was an infant. She was well known by European settlers in the area and her name is still attached to numerous locales in the Androscoggin River valley and surrounding territory.

Major characters Gareth Blackstock *Played By: Lenny Henry *Appears In: Series 1-3 Gareth Blackstock is the chef de cuisine and sometime co-owner of Le Chateau Anglais, a restaurant in Oxfordshire, specializing in twists on traditional French cuisine. He has attained two Michelin stars. He buys Le Chateau Anglais in Series One, with his wife, Janice, and they own and manage the restaurant through to the end of Series Two. Blackstock's expertise is well known, and he finished first in an international cooking competition. His temper is also well known, and he can be exceptionally rude to his staff, customers, and family members. Janice Blackstock *Played By: Caroline Lee-Johnson *Appears in: Series 1-3 Janice Blackstock is Gareth's wife; the two had been married for 8 years at the beginning of Series 1. She left a career in London to move to Oxfordshire with Gareth. When the couple purchase Le Chateau Anglais, she becomes the restaurant manager and attempts to impose restrictions on Gareth's free- spending ways in the kitchen in order to turn a profit. She also spends much of the time thinking of new avenues of publicity. In Series 3, she and Gareth split temporarily, but are reunited when she is discovered to be pregnant. Everton Stonehead *Played By: Roger Griffiths *Appears in: Series 1‚Äì3 Everton Stonehead went to school with Gareth growing up and dreams of becoming a top chef one day. He convinces Gareth to take him on as an assistant for no wages to learn the trade while Everton is supported by an aunt. Everton bumbles through his early days in the kitchen, but eventually becomes adept at cooking, helping Gareth with Caribbean cuisine and developing a signature dish of his own. By the end of the series, Everton has become a sort of confidant for Gareth. Everton nearly always ends his sentences with \\"sort of thing,\\" often to comical effect. Kitchen staff Lucinda *Played By: Claire Skinner *Appears in: Series 1 Lucinda is promoted to sous chef at the beginning of Series I, being the most talented and capable of Gareth's kitchen staff. Despite her talent, it takes a budget cut to earn her promotion, which comes with no increase in pay. She has Gareth's respect and stands up to him more than any of the other staff will. Although generally more good-tempered than Gareth, angering Lucinda is just as unwise, as she is just as scathing and even more ruthless than he. Gustave LaRoche *Played By: Ian McNeice, 3 episodes in 1994 and Jeff Nuttal, 6 episodes in 1996 *Appears in: Series 2, 3 Gustave LaRoche was a talented chef about ten years before the setting of the show. His real name is Gary Lamston (spelling uncertain), but he changed his name because, in his day, one had to be French to be taken seriously as a chef. In Series 2 (\\"A River Runs Through It\\") Gareth seeks him out to replace Lucinda as sous chef. He is found working in The Proven√ßal, a small restaurant in an out-of-the-way town. It is later revealed that his alcoholism forced him to such a small kitchen where he did not cook with wine. Gareth, Janice and Everton help him to receive treatment for his alcoholism, but he does have relapses. In series 3, he mostly dislikes Savannah but on occasion teams up with her to achieve a goal, such as firing Reeny/Renee. Piers *Played By: Gary Parker *Appears in: Series 1 Piers is a kitchen laborer who often deals with the presentation of food. His penchant for smoking marijuana nearly gets Gareth into legal trouble while he is out searching for unpasteurized Stilton cheese. Piers frequently finds himself on the receiving end of Gareth's fiery temper, in fact he is a close second to Everton in the verbal abuse stakes. Otto *Played By: Erkan Mustafa *Appears in: Series 1 Otto is a kitchen staff worker. He doesn't appear to be especially talented nor especially incompetent. Crispin *Played By: Tim Matthews *Appears in: Series 2 Crispin is a kitchen staff worker. Crispin is revealed to come from a wealthy background and has picked up some amorous habits from his father. Donald *Played By: Gary Bakewell *Appears in: Series 2 Donald is a kitchen staff worker. He has a poor relationship with his father. Debra *Played By: Pui Fan Lee *Appears in: Series 2 Debra is a kitchen staff worker. She also is a hopeless romantic who is especially susceptible to the smell of onions. Pui Fan Lee is best known for playing Po on Teletubbies. Alice *Played By: Hilary Lyon *Appears in: Series 2 Alice is a kitchen staff worker. She especially dislikes Gustave, seeming to resent Gareth's decision to hire a sous chef from outside the restaurant instead of promoting her. Savannah Concord *Played By: Lorelei King *Appears in: Series 3 Savannah is a talented sous chef who began working at Le Chateau between series 2 and 3. She is American, and frequently reminisces about her glamorous life at home. Savannah takes Alice's place as Gustave's main rival. Savannah becomes involved in several complicated romantic situations: she develops an attraction to Gareth, but spurns Cyril, the restaurant owner for part of the show's run. In the final episode, Gareth dramatically stops her from returning to America, leading her to threaten him with a knife, until he assures her that he only wants her to run the restaurant while he reconciles with Janice. Ren√©e Bryson *Played By: Sophie Walker *Appears in: Series 3 Ren√©e is a kitchen staff worker and the daughter of Cyril, the owner of the restaurant. She has no talent for cooking and the other staff largely resents her presence. Ren√©e is very sensitive about her name, and the rest of the staff mispronounces it (using the faux-British pronunciation \\"Reeney\\") to upset her frequently. She has a short-lived romance with Everton, but does not take their breakup nearly as hard as he does. They later reconcile. Support staff Lola *Played By: Elizabeth Bennett *Appears in: Series 1 Lola serves as the Ma√Ætre d' of Le Chateau Anglais. She is especially fond of food and spends much effort attempting to sample all of Gareth's dishes, noting that each is her ‚Äúfavourite.‚Äù She is surprisingly sensitive to Gareth's moods and how he might react to situations; in the first episode, she correctly guesses the right moment to interrupt Gareth's tirade at a customer and expresses astonishment that said customer has met people as rude as Gareth before. Alphonse *Played By: Jean Luc Rebaliati *Appears in: Series 2 Alphonse is the new sommelier, and at some point takes over from Lola as Ma√Ætre d'. Gareth appears to trust Alphonse and incorporates him in the occasional scheme to show Everton up. Alphonse also helps Gareth find satisfactory English wine to use in a cooking competition. Cyril Bryson *Played By: Dave Hill *Appears in: Series 3 Cyril buys Le Chateau Anglais from Gareth and Janice when it goes into financial trouble. He is enamoured with Savannah, the American sous chef. Gareth and Cyril get into frequent arguments about business decisions, including Rene√©'s presence in the kitchen.

The Sorb(ian) March (; ) was a frontier district on the eastern border of East Francia in the 9th through 11th centuries. It was composed of several counties bordering the Sorbs. The Sorbian march seems to have comprised the eastern part of Thuringia. The Sorbian march was sometimes referred to as the Thuringian March. The term \\"Sorbian march\\" appears only four times in the Annales Fuldenses.  History  Three rulers are recorded: Poppo, Thachulf, and Radulf. The commanders of the Sorbian march bore the title dux Sorabici (limitis) in the Annales, but are also referred to elsewhere as counts (comites), margraves (marchiones), and dukes of Thuringia (duces Thuringorum). The march was probably ruled primarily by the Babenberg family. The boundary between Thuringia and the Sorbs was defined as the Saale river by Einhard, writing in the 830s: ' (\\"the river Saale, which divides the Thuringii and the Sorbs\\"). Erfurt was then the chief economic centre of eastern Thuringia. The Sorbian march probably (loosely) included the land east of the Saale as far as the Elster and the Pleisse, which might have been controlled by castles. The Sorbian march may have been only the area west of the Saale, east of it, or on both sides. The Sorbian march was frequently troubled in the 9th century by Slavic insurrections, who were tributaries of the Germans. In the 10th century the march formed part of the vast marca Geronis from 937 until 965. During this period, the Sorbs were reduced to serfdom and the march was largely pacified. After 965, it formed a part of the March of Meissen.  Sources  *Reuter, Timothy (trans.) The Annals of Fulda. (Manchester Medieval series, Ninth- Century Histories, Volume II.)

History It was opened by Maurice and May Woodson on July 4, 1931. The Woodsons were Memphians who were looking for a change of pace from city life. Maurice Woodson was a cotton linter and president of Woodson Brothers, Inc., a company that he owned with his brothers Edward and R. Peyton Woodson. Some time in the late 1920s, Maurice was told by his doctor that he must give up his business for his health‚Äôs sake. Soon after the couple purchased of land in DeSoto County, Mississippi. On the property was a clear, spring fed lake. With the help of a mule team, they dug the lake out and lined the bottom with several hundred tons of white sand imported from Destin, Florida. Then, tapping down into a natural artesian water basin below the ground, they filled it with cold, clear water, which eventually fed into two other lakes on the property. Lake Shahkoka, as it was called, after a Chickasaw Indian who once lived on the land, soon had picnic tables, barbecue pits, pavilions, a bowling alley, and a mini golf course, as well as playgrounds, a snack bar and tearoom at the Maywood swimming pool (It had been renamed after Mrs. Woodson). These amenities were added as the Woodson's sold getaway homes around their property. The pool was a great success; Memphians came from opening day in May to its close in September. It became a surrogate beach for Memphians longing for the ocean and hosted TV commercials for Memphis-based Coppertone, publicity photos for beauty queens, weddings, baptisms, church picnics, parachutists, class reunions, and corporate gatherings. There was a pavilion on site which was a popular dance arena from the 1930s onward, and Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and a host of others played there early in their careers. For more than half a century, Maywood remained largely unchanged. It was marketed as a \\"Swimming beach;\\" it was not called a \\"Water park\\" until some radio ads started calling it that in the 1990s. Water slides were added over the years, but the clear lake remained spring-fed and was clear enough to see your feet while standing in five feet of water. Closing The unexpected news that Maywood was closing came from current owner Hugh Armistead. He blamed higher insurance costs as he explained in the Memphis newspaper, The Commercial Appeal. The lake and surrounding property were turned into a private residential development. The park closed in July 2003. The closest similar, spring-fed water park is Willow Springs Water Park, roughly three hours away by automobile.

It was named after William F. Holcomb, who found gold there in 1860. That year started the largest gold rush in the Southern California region.\\"NO. 619: HOLCOMB VALLEY\\" , State Historical Landmarks, San Bernardino County The boomtown of Belleville grew up near there and flourished for about ten years before being abandoned. The site is now registered as California Historical Landmark #619. Gold In May 1860, gold was found there by William F. Holcomb and Ben Choteau. They were miners who had been prospecting at Bear Valley. Holcomb found gold while he was tracking a bear in the valley later named after him. After Holcomb and Ben Ware filed mine claims on five sites in May 1860 at the County Recorder's office, word spread quickly and prospectors rushed to the area. L. Burr Belden, Holcomb Valley Gold Discovery; Billy Holcomb's own story , Bloomington, CA: San Bernardino County Museum Association, 1955, ISBN B0007FX5TQ Before long, a gold camp sprang up within 150 inches of where the gold was found. It became a town and, after the first child Belle was born, the new town was named Belleville in her honor. It soon became the largest town in San Bernardino County with a population of about 1,500. Often perpetuated by local newsmen, is the myth that Belleville was almost once the County seat. The story goes that Belleville residents felt they deserved the honor of being the county seat and placed this measure on the ballot in either 1860 or 1861. After the election, ballots were being counted at the County Court House (in San Bernardino City) around an open bonfire when one of the ballot boxes, allegedly from Belleville, was accidentally, kicked into the fire and destroyed. When the count was completed, Belleville had lost the county seat election by the slim margin of two votes. However, the California Constitution allows for a change in county seat only through legislative action in which it may directly decide the location, or delegate the authority to the voters of the county, which would require it to be placed on the local ballot. There was no legislative act on record in State Records to change the county seat from San Bernardino to Belleville, in any year, let alone 1860 or 1861. Any item up for election on the local ballot was required to be posted in the local newspaper. The only items published in both 1860 and 1861 were the names of the people running for office and school bonds. The items up for election are also required to be listed in the Board of Supervisor minutes, there is no such listing for the change of the County seat. Also there is no mention of the election or missing ballots in Holcomb's recollections which were written in the 1870s only a few years later at the behest of the San Bernardino Pioneer Society. Belleville was a place filled with rough characters competing over gold, it was considered a place of violence and hanging justice.

The elder Buonaccorso da Montemagno (died 1390) was a jurisconsult and ambassador who made a compilation of Pistoia's statutes in 1371. Poems are uncertainly attributed to him. The younger, Giovane Buonaccorso da Montemagno (Pistoia 1391/93 ‚Äî Florence 16 December 1429), nephew of the elder, was a Renaissance humanist. He was a judge in the Santa Croce quarter of Florence (1421) and in September of that year was appointed Maestro in the Studio fiorentino. In his poems (Rime), if they are not his uncles', he imitated Petrarch's sonnetti d'amore, setting an example for fifteenth-century Petrarchism. The younger Buonaccorso was highly esteemed for his public orations, in which Cristoforo Landino ranked him with Boccaccio, Leone Battista Alberti, and Matteo Palmieri.Giuliari, 1874:xvii. In July 1428 he was sent as ambassador to the Duke of Milan to establish the terms of the peace treaty in which Florence had acted as the ally of Venice. Buonaccorso's De nobilitate, an outstanding expression of the literary topos of the New Man ‚Äî Homo novus ‚Äî whose nobility is inherent in his own character and career, was translated into English by John Tiptoft, created Earl of Worcester and published in 1481 by William Caxton, as Here foloweth the Argument of the declamacyon which laboureth to shewe. wherein honoure sholde reste. It was rendered in play form, still in Latin, by Sixt Birck and published at Augsburg in 1538. The language of the Orazioni and the Rime were cited in Antonio Francesco Grazzini's Vocabulario, published by the Accademia della Crusca, as exemplars of the purest Italian verse and prose.

The Conquestbury manor house stood near the southeast end of the village on the ground now known as Bury Farm, adjacent to London Lane. The Manor and its lands then passed to the Beauchamp family.Beatrice de Beauchamp, d.after 1150, was heiress of the manor of Houghton Conquest in Bedfordshire. Refer: Liber S.

Parts of the original house were used to build a house in the 1850s, which today serves as a village shop. Houghton House was also built in the area in approximately 1615. In 1794, Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford stripped Houghton House of its furnishings and removed the roof. Today, the remains of Houghton House stand as ruins.

Prior to the expansion of Sam the Record Man in the early 1960s, A&A; was the dominant record store chain in Canada. It was acquired by CBS Records after it lost the dominant market position to the Sam's chain, but was reacquired by a Toronto investment group in 1981. History The company was founded at the end of World War II by Alice Kenner, her husband Mac, with the assistance of her brother, Aaron as A&A; Bookstore after Alice and Aaron's first initials, at 351 Yonge Street in a building that had been purchased by Kenner and her husband, Mac. The family also founded the A&A; Lunchroom in the same building. In the early 1950s, the store added a record section to sell LP records which were gaining in popularity among young people. Within a few years, record sales became the dominant portion of the store's business. In 1960, A&A; Books & Records Company of Canada licensed several franchises across Canada and in 1971, the Kenners sold the business to CBS Records.http://news.library.ryerson.ca/musiconyonge/a-historical-corner- page-5/ In 1974, its operations consisted of the main store at 351 Yonge Street in Toronto, another flagship store on rue Sainte-Catherine in Montreal and six franchise stores in Ontario. The company also had two wholly owned subsidiaries: Glen Music, which had four stores in Alberta, and Glen Music Western, which had six stores in British Columbia. By the end of 1974, the company decided to close its book business that was located in the basement floor of its flagship store at 351 Yonge Street, Toronto. The senior management consisted of general manager Rick McGraw and vice-president of marketing R. Bruce Wilson. Its offices were located above the retail store at 351 Yonge Street, in a small portion of the second and third floor. The second floor was classical department and the third floor was being used as the warehouse. The company itself was a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Records Canada. In the spring of 1975, the accounting office was relocated to 75 The Donway West, while the management offices remained at 351 Yonge Street. In 1981 CBS sold its retail and wholesale pre-recorded music business to some of its former executives - Terry Lynd, Fred Rich and Dick Moody, who took over the company as Chairman, President and Executive Vice-President respectively and collectively held majority ownership. The corporate name under the new ownership was Sound Insight Limited, while retail stores kept the trade name A&A; Records and Tapes, and later A&A; Music & Entertainment. Between 1981 and 1987, the company made several acquisitions including the purchase of Flipside retail chain from Polydor Records. In 1987 the company reported its best financial results - sales of $134 million and net income of over $7 million. That same year, Sound Insight was purchased by a group of Canadian and US investors and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Vector No. Acquisition Corporation. During this period the company went through a period of rapid expansion, opening almost 100 new retail stores during 1989. By 1990, A&A; had 260 retail stores across Canada, and had a presence in every province. The company's sudden expansion, however, proved to be its undoing: many of the new locations were opened with no cohesive marketing strategy, and almost all of the new locations proved to be unprofitable and unsustainable. During peak Christmas season in 1990, company's sales were $400,000 to $600,000 below breakeven. Senior management discussed several options to stabilize the business. It was decided that to shed unprofitable store CCAA filing was the only viable option. The corporation filed for protection under the Company Creditors Arrangement Act in January 1993. Bankruptcy The chain emerged from bankruptcy under the ownership of Lincoln Capital Corporation, but again filed for bankruptcy in 1993 and was dissolved when its assets were sold piecemeal, and its remaining retail outlets were absorbed by other retailers. Many A&A; stores were absorbed into the Music World or Sunrise Records chains. In December 1993, the flagship Yonge Street store became a Future Shop, which later relocated to the nearby 10 Dundas East complex. The location was sold to Ryerson University, and the building torn down in 2010, along with A&A;'s former rival - the nearby Sam the Record Man flagship store.

From 1960 to 1962, the team was known as the Dallas Texans and had very similar team logos and uniforms. Logos When the Texans began playing in 1960, the team's logo consisted of the state of Texas in white with a yellow star marking the location of the city of Dallas. Originally, Hunt chose Columbia Blue and Orange for the Texans' uniforms, but Bud Adams chose the colors for his Houston Oilers franchise. Hunt reverted to red and gold for the Texans' uniforms, which even after the team relocated to Kansas City, remain as the franchise's colors to this day. The state of Texas on the team's helmet was replaced by a design originally sketched by Lamar Hunt on a napkin. Hunt's inspiration for the interlocking \\"KC\\" design was the \\"SF\\" inside of an oval on the San Francisco 49ers helmets. Kansas City's overlapping initials appear inside a white arrowhead instead of an oval and are surrounded by a thin black outline. From 1960 to 1973, the Chiefs had grey facemask bars on their helmets, but changed to white bars for 1974. Prior to the inaugural American Football League season in 1960, Hunt's Texans were represented by a whirling, spur-clad, 10-gallon-hat-wearing character that was featured on various promotional items. The logo eventually gave way to a more polished football- toting gunslinger set over the state of Texas, a design created by Bob Taylor, a cartoonist for the now-defunct Dallas Times Herald. Although never part of the club's uniform, Taylor's updated Texans logo adorned everything from the club's stationery to the billboard outside the team's offices. When the franchise moved in 1963, Taylor was commissioned to produce a new logo that remained strikingly similar to his original incarnation. Taylor's new rendition featured a Native American figure running with the same stride and holding the pigskin in the same manner as the gunslinger with the states of Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Iowa and Arkansas serving as his backdrop. This logo was utilized prominently during the 1960s and was affixed to the club's Swope Park headquarters on 63rd Street before the club moved to Arrowhead Stadium in 1972. The logo, embedded in the grass, still remains off the highway to this day. In 2014, popular sports uniform evaluation blog Uni Watch made an observation that throughout the team's history there has been an inconsistency in the usage of the logo regarding the letter \\"C\\" in \\"KC\\". In some usages the \\"C\\" has an open face, and in others it is closed. When asked about this, the Chiefs PR and equipment staff said, \\"there is no rhyme or reason to it. Wish I had more to tell you, but it definitely is interesting. Never noticed that before!\\" Uniforms Unlike several NFL franchises, the Chiefs' uniform design has essentially remained the same throughout the club's history. It consists of a red helmet, and either red or white jerseys with the opposite color numbers and names. White pants were used with both jerseys from 1960-1967 and 1989-1999. After a brief disappearance, the Chiefs re-introduced the all-white uniform combinations for the 2006 season. Although many NFL teams in recent years have worn their dark jerseys with their dark pants, the Chiefs unveiled their all-red combination for their 2013 home opener against the Dallas Cowboys. When the Chiefs wear their red uniforms, they had always worn white pants, until September 15, 2013. The Chiefs have never worn an alternate jersey in a game, although gold jerseys with red numbers trimmed in white, and black jerseys with red numbers trimmed in gold, are sold for retail. The white jersey-red pants combination was not used between 1989 and 1999, primarily during the period when Marty Schottenheimer was the team's head coach. In 2006, under new head coach Herman Edwards, the Chiefs wore white uniforms with white pants at home against the Cincinnati Bengals. Prior to that game, the Chiefs had only worn their white jerseys at home in 1980, which they did for all eight home games that season under Marv Levy. Following Lamar Hunt's death on December 13, 2006, the Chiefs wore the all-white combination for road games against the San Diego Chargers on December 17 and Oakland Raiders on December 23. It is said the all-white combination was a tribute to Hunt, who reportedly favored the all-white uniforms. The team wore the all-white combination in their playoff game versus the Indianapolis Colts. The team did not wear the all-white combination during the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In 2009, the Chiefs wore the all-white Dallas Texans throwback uniform in an AFL Legacy game against the Oakland Raiders November 15. They wore the modern all-white uniform against the Cincinnati Bengals December 27. In 2007, the Kansas City Chiefs honored the late Lamar Hunt and the AFL with a special patch. In 2008, the patch became permanently affixed to the left chest of both Kansas City's home and away jerseys. In select games for the 2009 season, the Chiefs--as well as the other founding teams of the American Football League--wore \\"throwback\\" uniforms to celebrate the AFL's 50th anniversary and the 1962 Dallas Texans team that won the AFL Championship. A slight change was made to the uniforms when Nike became the supplier of all NFL jerseys. The numbers were moved from to the top of the shoulders and the stripes on the sleeves were made larger.

Early life Kemp was born in Kingston upon Hull in 1872, the second of six children of Joseph Kemp and Mary Hopkin. His father, a policeman, drowned while on duty, and his mother died less than two years later when he was only nine. UK and US Influenced by the Keswick movement, Kemp worked as a bible class teacher in his early years, and studied at the Glasgow Bible Training Institute from 1893 to 1895. He pastored churches in Kelso (1897‚Äì1898), Hawick (1898‚Äì1902), and Charlotte Chapel, Edinburgh (1902‚Äì1915), and then pastored Calvary Baptist Church (1915‚Äì1917) and Metropolitan Baptist Tabernacle (1917‚Äì1919) in New York City. New Zealand In August 1920 Kemp was appointed to the Auckland Baptist Tabernacle. He was known as the prime spokesperson for American fundamentalism in New Zealand. He founded the New Zealand Bible Training Institute in 1922. This college went on to become the leading educational institutional for evangelicals in New Zealand, a position it holds to this day as Laidlaw College. He founded the Reaper in March 1923, a monthly journal devoted to fundamentalist and revivalist theology, and in 1924 helped to found the NgƒÅruawƒÅhia convention. After seeing the detrimental effect of fundamentalism on interdenominational work during a visit to the United States in 1926, Kemp softened his stance somewhat, partly due to the influence of Baptist College of New Zealand principal J. J. North. He was a leading influence on a number of leading New Zealand evangelicals, including William H. Pettit and E. M. Blaiklock. His grandson Ian served as a lecturer, vice principal and acting Principal at the Auckland campus of Bible College of New Zealand, and his great-grandson Hugh has served as lecturer and Dean at the Manawatu Regional center of Bible College of New Zealand in Palmerston North. Kemp was a member of the Baptist College committee (1923‚Äì1933), president of the Baptist Union of New Zealand (1929), and vice president of the Crusader Union of New Zealand (1931‚Äì1933). He died in Auckland, New Zealand.

The Thema Mundi (\\"World Theme\\", with 'theme' being a word that also means chart) was a mythical horoscope used in Hellenistic astrology that shows the supposed positions of the seven visible planets (including the Sun and Moon) at the beginning of the universe.Macrobius in his Commentary to the Dream of Scipio, Book I, ch.21 has been the most popular source. It purports to exemplify the logic behind the sign rulerships, exaltations, and meanings of the aspects, among other things. The purely symbolic nature of the chart is readily perceived from the impossible positions of Venus and Mercury in it.Venus is at 60¬∞ from the Sun and Mercury at 30¬∞, while in reality the angular distance for Venus is never more than 47.8¬∞ and for Mercury it is less than 27.8¬∞. In the late Middle Ages there has been a confusion between a horoscope of the world and the thema mundi.Most conspicuously seen in the writings of Pierre d'Ailly, cf. Laura A. Smoller, History, Prophecy, and the Stars: The Christian Astrology of Pierre D'Ailly, 1350-1420, Princeton University Press (Princeton, NJ; 1994) . The chart significantly diverges from the theory that the houses and the signs are directly correlated. Modern astrology assumes that Aries, the first sign, conveys its character to the first house. Instead, the thema mundi has Cancer in the ascendant, suggesting that nature, rather than being aggressive (in correspondence to Aries and Mars), is nurturing (in accord with the symbolism of Cancer and the Moon). Structure The Thema Mundi shows: *Cancer rising, with the Moon in Cancer *The Sun in Leo *Mercury in Virgo *Venus in Libra *Mars in Scorpio *Jupiter in Sagittarius *Saturn in Capricorn Rationale The Thema Mundi's structure provided a backing for many of the concepts in Hellenistic astrology. Planetary domiciles The Sun and Moon, the two luminaries, are assigned to the two signs that correspond to the brightest and warmest times of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, Cancer and Leo. The other planets are assigned to signs by halving the zodiac between Cancer and Leo and assigning each planet to one sign on the solar half and each on the lunar half. Mercury is assigned to the two signs next to the luminaries, Gemini and Virgo, because it never travels more than one sign away from the Sun. Venus is assigned to the next two signs, Taurus and Libra, because it never gets more than two signs away. Jupiter and Mars are assigned to their signs Sagittarius and Pisces, and Aries and Scorpio, respectively, in this same way. Finally, Saturn is assigned to Capricorn and Aquarius because of the cold and lack of light during this time of the year. Astrological aspects The natures of astrological aspects are determined by the planets' configurations to the luminaries in the Thema Mundi. In it, the aspects made by the planets correlate with their benefic or malefic classification. *Saturn makes an opposition (180¬∞) to the Moon, and so the opposition is said to be of the nature of Saturn. Saturn is the greater of the two malefics, and so the opposition is the most negative and harmful of the two negative aspects. *Mars makes a square (90¬∞) to the Sun, so the square is said to be of the nature of Mars. Mars is the lesser malefic, so the square is the least negative of the two aspects. *Jupiter is making a trine (120¬∞) to the Sun, so the trine's nature is that of Jupiter. Since Jupiter is the greater of the two benefics, the trine is said to be the most desirable positive aspect. *Venus is making a sextile (60¬∞) to the Sun and thus the sextile is of the nature of Venus, the weaker of the two benefics. *Mercury is making a semi-sextile (30¬∞, or half a sextile) to both the Sun and Venus, along with a sextile (60¬∞) to both the Moon and Mars.

A member of the National Party, he also served as a Minister and Deputy Premier in various Queensland administrations during the 1980s, and was instrumental in establishing the Fitzgerald Inquiry.  Early life  Gunn was born in Laidley in the Lockyer Valley west of Brisbane, Queensland, the youngest of seven children to Ewen William Gunn and his wife Rosia (n√©e Geismann). He attended Laidley North Primary School and Gatton High School, and played representative rugby league football for Ipswich in the Bulimba Cup competition. At 21, he joined the Freemasons' Lodge, in which he was heavily involved until the start of his political career. During World War II, he served in the First Cavalry Mobile Veterinary Service at Gympie, where he developed his knowledge of veterinary practice, which he continued privately after the war. On 12 April 1952, he married Lorna Klibbe, who he had met working in a local cafe. They were to have five children and, ultimately, 17 grandchildren.  Politics  On 20 July 1966, Gunn was appointed to a vacancy on the Laidley Shire Council, and on 10 April 1970, he became Chairman of the Shire, a role in which he served until 1973. At the 1972 state election, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly seat of Somerset, which covered much of the Lockyer Valley. After the 1980 state election, he became Minister of Education on 23 December 1980. On 6 December 1982, he vacated this role in order that Lin Powell could enter the ministry, and took on the new portfolio of Commerce and Industry. On 18 August, following a split in the Coalition which saw all Liberal members removed from the Ministry, Gunn was promoted to Deputy Premier. He was also the Minister assisting the Treasurer. On 6 February 1986, he replaced Bill Glasson as Minister for Police, and served as the Queensland representative on the National Crime Authority. During the Joh for Canberra campaign being planned by Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and a number of his supporters, Gunn assumed control and chaired cabinet meetings on a number of occasions. He was explicitly favoured by Bjelke-Petersen to succeed himself as Premier. However, concerns about corruption in the police force had been aired on Four Corners (in Chris Masters' \\"Moonlight State\\", aired on 11 May 1987) and in other media including the state newspaper The Courier-Mail. Gunn, who was described by the Courier-Mail as an \\"honest and thoroughly decent politician\\", wanted the allegations investigated and on 26 May 1987, at a meeting chaired by Gunn, the government agreed to a commission of inquiry which came to be known as the Fitzgerald Inquiry. The hearings began two months later and ultimately were to prove the undoing of the conservative government which had been in power for over 30 years. Furthermore, Gunn also renominated Sir Robert Sparkes, by this stage not on good terms with Bjelke-Petersen, to another term as party president. Bjelke-Petersen had been forced to name a retirement date of 8 August 1988, and at the Townsville conference of the National Party in November 1987, delegates approved Sparkes's position with regard to a number of issues, and rebuffed that of Bjelke-Petersen. Gunn told the Courier-Mail on 8 November that Sir Joh was \\"out of time\\" and that he should \\"go fishing, have a rest and do a fair bit of thinking\\".Courier-Mail, 9 November 1987. On 23‚Äì24 November, Bjelke-Petersen visited the Governor of Queensland Sir Walter Campbell, attempting to have five ministers sacked‚Äîincluding Gunn for alleged disloyalty in nominating Sparkes as party president‚Äîand seeking support for an early election. The Governor, however, received advice from Gunn and fellow ministers Mike Ahern and Brian Austin that Bjelke-Petersen no longer had parliamentary support. He therefore interpreted the crisis as a political rather than constitutional one, and declined to intervene, suggesting the party room should resolve it. On 26 November, a caucus meeting was called to replace Bjelke-Petersen as leader‚Äîa spill motion was carried 39 votes to 8, and Ahern won the leadership with 30 votes to Gunn's 16 and Russ Hinze's 2. Gunn won the deputy leadership unopposed. Bjelke-Petersen finally stepped down on 1 December 1987. Ahern and Gunn then each assumed eight portfolios temporarily while the process of choosing a new Cabinet was undertaken, and on 9 December, Gunn was appointed Deputy Premier, Minister for Public Works, Main Roads, Police and the World Expo 88 to be held in Brisbane. Among other things, he was responsible for a multimillion-dollar program to help local councils develop regional road infrastructure, and getting bullet-proof vests as standard issue for police officers. On 25 September, following Russell Cooper's ascension to the premiership, he became Minister for Finance and Local Government. The National Party was defeated at the December 1989 elections by the Labor Party led by Wayne Goss. Gunn's seat of Somerset was abolished in a redistribution designed to end the so-called Bjelkemander which had malapportioned seats in favour of country areas, and he retired at the 1992 election.  Later life  Gunn's daughter Helen married a man from Badu Island in the Torres Strait, and Gunn visited the islands many times, developing a love for the islands and their people, culture and history. On 20 September 2001, he died at the Gatton Hospital and was buried privately after a State funeral at the Laidley Cultural Centre six days later.  Legacy  The Bill Gunn Dam is named after him.

Each gabled- roofed apartment-style building contains sixteen 4-bedroom apartments while the 155 bed Building J contains amenities for use by residents of the entire complex. Designed by Renaissance 3 Architects, P.C., the combined complex houses 651 upper-level undergraduate students in 172 units located on the lower campus close to Posvar Hall, the Barco Law Building, and adjacent to Sennott Square. History The Bouquet Gardens complex sits on a property bounded by Oakland Avenue, South Bouquet and Sennott Streets which was acquired by the Pennsylvania General State Authority in 1967 by invoking eminent domain for the reasons of expediting Pitt's expansion following the university joining the Commonwealth System of Higher Education as a \\"state- related\\" institution in 1966. Additionally, the state declared that only academic buildings could be developed on the lot. For years, use and development of the land was disputed by the city and Oakland community, and as funding for the development lagged, some existing structures on the property were rented by the university to community groups. Following a renewed pledge of state funding by Governor Tom Ridge in the mid 1990s, university plans to for student housing and the south edge of campus were renewed. Intended to architecturally blend the new south edge of campus into South Oakland, the original facades of the buildings were redesigned following community input in order better reflect the eclectic mix of brick and Victorian townhouses and low-rise apartment blocks of the mostly residential South Oakland neighborhood. The university also provided assistance in relocating community groups who had rented space on the property from the university as construction plans moved forward. Ground was broken on the first phase of the complex, which included 3 buildings, on December 1, 1998 and was completed and opened in the fall of 1999 for $5.3 million. The first phase of the construction represented the first new on-campus structures built in 7 years. The second phase added five buildings at a cost of $9.2 million and opened in the fall of 2000 bringing the total beds for the gabled-roofed apartment-style buildings to 496 in 124 units. Amenities Each unit is air-conditioned, furnished, and includes four single bedrooms, a kitchen with refrigerator, stove and microwave, a living room and dining area, two bathrooms, and cable and internet connections. Building J expansion Entrance to Building J, the largest and newest addition to Bouquet Gardens In November 2009, the university approved the purchase of a $1.4 million three-quarter-acre parcel of land contiguous to the existing Bouquet Gardens site for expansion of the housing complex. The project, designed by Perkins Eastman, paralleled the design of the garden-style Bouquet Gardens apartments and added a four-story, building. The building, which is designated as \\"Building J\\", has 155 beds in 48 three- and four-person apartment-style units. The residence hall opened for the fall semester of 2011, increasing the total number of the university's Pittsburgh campus beds to 7,396. The building also includes a resident director's apartment, a campus police substation, laundry and mail facilities, an indoor bicycle storage area, and a fitness room for Bouquet Gardens residents' use.

Early years and education Moore attended schools in Haddonfield, Philadelphia and New York, and was a graduate of Williams College in Massachusetts. He then received an MBA and the degree of Doctor of Commercial Science from the Harvard School of Business Administration. He taught at UCLA for two years, then returned to Boston to author textbooks on taxes and work as a financial consultant. Early career Moore's career as a mountaineer started early, with an ascent of Chimborazo and the first ascent of Sangay, both in the Andes of Ecuador, in 1927. In the early 1930s, he made the first ascents of Mount Bona and Mount Fairweather, both major Alaskan peaks, with Allen Carp√©, and he also made the first unguided ascent of Mount Robson in the Canadian Rockies. Most famous climb These ascents led to his most famous climb, the first ascent (with Richard Burdsall) of Minya Konka, a peak in Sichuan, China. Their small party (also including Arthur Emmons and Jack Young) also carefully surveyed the peak and settled a controversy about its height. In making the ascent the summit pair climbed thousands of feet higher than any other Americans had previously. Consultant and other work During World War II Moore served as a consultant to the U.S. military on arctic and mountain conditions, and as a member of the Alaskan Test Expedition in 1942. In that capacity he made the third ascent of Mount McKinley. After the war, he was president of the New England Society of Natural History, which was deeply enmeshed with the Boston Museum of Science, headed by Bradford Washburn, also a noted climber of Alaskan peaks. Moore served three years as the president of the University of Alaska, starting in 1949, and during that time he also established records for high-altitude airplane landings. Moore Residence Hall, which along with Bartlett Hall are two 8-story buildings anchoring the upper dorm complex on the Fairbanks campus, was named for him.

Poppo, a Babenberg, was the younger brother of Henry of Franconia.Reuter, AF, 55 n4. They also had a younger brother named Egino. All three may have been the sons or grandsons of Poppo (I) of Grapfeld. Poppo replaced Radulf II in the Sorbian March no later than 880.Reuter, AF, 73 n3. Poppo may have been the brother-in-law of Radulf and'or son-in-law of Thachulf. In that year, the Daleminzi, Bohemians, and Sorbs threatened to invade Thuringia and burn the German-allied Slav districts. Poppo's subsequent expedition against them is recorded in three different variations in the three different manuscript traditions of the Annales Fuldenses.Reuter, AF, 3 n9. He may or may not have led the Thuringii in this campaign, but he was certainly victorious. The reasons behind Poppo's battles in 882, 883, and 884 are unknown.Reuter, Germany, 81.

AF(B), 883 (p. 107). Poppo was deprived of his offices and titles in 892.AF(B), 892 (p. 124 and n9). According to Regino of Pr√ºm, Poppo had advised Arn, Bishop of W√ºrzburg, to undertake the expedition against the Slavs on which he was killed earlier that year. Because Poppo was replaced in Thuringia by Conrad and Arn was replaced by Rudolf, both Conradines, it has been supposed that King Arnulf was merely patronising one family over another: the Conradines and Babenbergers were feuding shortly afterwards. On the other hand, Poppo may have been punished for the ill- advised campaign of Arn. He was restored to his lands in 899 and made Count of the Bavarian Nordgau in 903. He was Count of the Volkfeld in 906. He died sometime after. Sources *Reuter, Timothy. Germany in the Early Middle Ages 800-1056\\\\. New York: Longman, 1991. *Reuter, Timothy (trans.)

The interview by Metropolitan Ambrosios Zografos of Korea, The Orthodox World, 12 February 2019. History In 1897, in view of the increased presence of Russia‚Ä≤s government officers in Korea, the government of the Russian Empire made a decision to send Russian Orthodox missionaries to Korea. Archimandrite Ambrosius Gudko led the three-person team, but was refused permission to enter the country. In 1900, a more hospitable atmosphere between Russia and Korea allowed a second missionary team led by Archimandrite Chrysanthos Shehtkofsky to begin an outreach in Seoul. He was joined in Korea by Hierodeacon Nicholas Alexeiev of the original team, and chanter Jonah Leftsenko. On 17 February 1900, in a makeshift chapel the first attested Orthodox Divine Liturgy was celebrated in the Korean peninsula. The first Orthodox church was constructed in Jung Dong, Jung-gu, the central area of Seoul in 1903 and was consecrated in honor of Saint Nicholas (the building has not survived). However, with the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910‚Äî1945) came a period of persecution of Orthodox Christian believers. Notwithstanding, in 1912, John Kang Tak, the first native Korean Orthodox priest, was ordained. In November 1921, the Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate terminated its support of the Church of Korea, and subsequently the Japanese Orthodox Church gave up its jurisdictional authority. Thus, in 1946, the Orthodox Church of Korea was put into the position of having to organize itself as a parish. The year 1947 saw the ordination of a third Korean priest, Fr. Alexei Kim Ui-han, just as the last Russian priest departed the country. Father Alexei Kim was the sole priest of the Orthodox Church left to serve the people of Korea. On 9 July 1950, he was captured and disappeared without record. As the Korean War broke out in 1950, the Orthodox Christian community in the region was dispersed and the organised forms of church life were disrupted. In 1953, Army Chaplain Archimandrite Andreas Halkiopoulos of the Military Forces of Greece was made aware of Korean Orthodox faithful and arranged for a parish in Seoul to be reestablished. The following year Korean Orthodox Christian Boris Moon Yee- chun was ordained by Archbishop Ireneus of Japan in Tokyo. On 25 December 1955, after the Christmas Divine Liturgy, the General Assembly of the Orthodox Community of Saint Nicholas in Seoul unanimously decided to request being received in the jurisdictional authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Ecumenical Patriarchate, under the leadership of Patriarch Athenagoras I, granted the request. In 1956, by decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the pastoral care of the Church in Korea was commissioned to the Archdiocese of Australia and a shortly afterwards to the Archdiocese of North and South America, with Archbishop Mikhail Constantinides being the Exarch of Korea.THE KOREAN ORTHODOX CHURCH In 1975, Archimandrite Sotirios Trambas volunteered to serve in the Korean mission of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. During the ensuing years, he founded a monastery, several parishes both in Korea and in other places in Asia. In 1993, the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople elected Sotirios Trambas Bishop of Zelon and Auxiliary Bishop to the Metropolitan of New Zealand. In this role, Bishop Sotirios served as Exarch of Korea. On 20 April 2004, the Exarchate of Korea was raised to the rank of a Metropolis and Bishop Sotirios became the first Metropolitan of Korea. On 28 May 2008, Metropolitan Sotirios retired and was given the title of Metropolitan of Pisidia. On the same day, Bishop Ambrosios Zografos of Zelon, the Auxiliary Bishop of the Metropolis, was elected Metropolitan of Korea and Exarch of Japan.

KGRE-FM airs a Regional Mexican music format branded as El Tigre, simulcasting KGRE 1450 AM Greeley, Colorado. An additional 65-watt booster provides fill-in service to Fort Collins, while KGRE AM has a dependent co-channel translator (K271BN) that extends the FM signal to Greeley proper. History KGRE went on the air in 1998 and, after a two-year stint as a local station for Estes Park known as \\"102.1 K-Rocky\\" (KRKI), made several failed attempts to serve the Denver metro area. In 2000, it flipped to Top 40 as \\"U102\\" under new calls KXUU. The Top 40 format lasted only a few weeks and quickly gave way to Rhythmic CHR under the same name, largely due to new competition from cross-town KFMD 95.7 (\\"Kiss FM\\"). The station then morphed into Urban AC, again as \\"U102,\\" before scrapping the concept in favor of a Dance format as \\"102-1X\\" (KXDC). KXDC, in turn, gave way to a satellite-fed Classic Country format known as \\"102-1 Thunder Country.\\" Following the purchase of Colorado Springs country outlet KKCS-FM 101.9, 102.1 assumed a simulcast of that station, which remained on the air until nearby KJEB 102.3 (now KVOQ) completed its move into the Denver market and obliterated the more distant 102.1 signal. On January 3, 2019, an application was filed with the FCC for Greeley Broadcasting Corporation, which owns KGRE AM, to buy KGRE-FM; the company also applied to buy K271BN at that time. The sale was consummated on July 31, 2019, at a price of $1.175 million.

It was founded in 1993 as an acoustic female duo of Diana Arbenina and Svetlana Surganova. The ladies played guitar and violin respectively, sharing the vocal and songwriting duties evenly, eventually adding amplification to the band. Since its inception the band has participated in a variety of Russian musical festivals ‚Äî from the underground (such as Babye Leto and Moguchaya Kuchka) to the major events (Nashestvie, Maxidrom, Krylya), as well as touring extensively domestically and abroad. Best known singles of the band are Tridtsat Pervaya Vesna (\\"31st Spring\\"), Rubezh (\\"Frontier\\"), Stolitsa (\\"Capital\\"), Asfalt (\\"Asphalt\\"), and Aktrisa (\\"Actress\\"). The majority of the songs in the band's repertoire is written by Arbenina and Surganova, but some use the poetry of such famous authors as Joseph Brodsky, Anna Akhmatova, and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. In 2002 Svetlana Surganova left the band to create her own group Surganova i Orkestr (\\"Surganova and Orchestra\\"), and Diana remained the headliner of Night Snipers.–Æ–±–∏–ª–µ–π–Ω–∞—è –∞–∫—É—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –î–∏–∞–Ω—ã –ê—Ä–±–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–æ–π —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä–∞ XX Early history The official date of Nochnye Snaipery creation can be considered August 19, 1993 when Diana Arbenina and Svetlana Surganova met in Saint Petersburg. Soon afterwards they performed as an acoustic duo at the Second All-Russian Bard Song Festival, after which Diana returned to her home city of Magadan, and the creative project was placed on hiatus. In November 1993 Surganova moved to Magadan, and for the remainder of the academic year the duo gave concerts at a local casino \\"Imperial\\" and at the Magadan University where Diana was a student at the time. They also recorded a series of home concerts, given for the benefit of friends and relatives. These early recordings are quite sought out by the fans of the band. It is anecdotally accepted that the name Nochnye Snaipery was chosen after Diana and Svetlana were walking to public transportation after a gig, carrying a guitar and a violin in their cases, and were accosted by a man wanting to know if they were walking \\"to hunt or from a hunt,\\" thinking their instruments were shotguns. In May 1994 Nochnye Snaipery had won a regional round of the All-Russian Musical Competition \\"Student Spring\\" and tripped west to Samara for the finals, eventually moving back to St. Petersburg. While based there, the duo continued an active life of gigs, songwriting, underground performances etc., building a loyal following. 1996 sees Snipers in their first trip outside of Russia to attend a student festival in Denmark. Two books of their texts are published in the same year - –¶–µ–ª—å (\\"Goal\\") and –î—Ä—è–Ω—å (Rotter) (called \\"anti-songs\\" by the authors.) In February 1997 Diana and Svetlana added amplification to the acoustic guitar and violin, and collaborated with the drummers from the St. Petersburg band Soyuz Kommertcheskogo Avangarda (\\"The Union of Commercial Avant-Garde\\") Yura Degtyaryov and Alexei Ivanov, as well as with the guitar soloist Denis Doulitsky from the Vacuum' band. In June 1997 \\"Nochnye Snaipery\\" debuted on the Internet. Getting more notoriety, Diana and Svetlana sought help from the bands Ulme and Kuzya-band in recording some of their songs, which later would make up the album Detskiy Lepet (\\"Child's Babble\\"), published in 1999. After graduating from university, Diana and Svetlana devote all of their attention to professional music. In the summer of 1998 the women use an auditorium at the St Petersburg Zoo to record their first official album Kaplya Diogtia/V Botchke Meda (\\"Drop of tar/In a barrel of honey\\"), which is sold on audio tapes. They also acquire a manager (Svetlana Loseva) who organized the band's participation at the \\"Sirin\\" festival of female vocalists held in Tyumen. Loseva also introduces the Snipers to the former musicians from an iconic Russian rock group Nautilus Pompilius - bassist Igor Kopylov and drummer Albert Potapkin, who begin to perform with the band. By early 1999, Snipers are in rotation on radio and television in St Petersburg, and in May 1999 they have their first performance in Moscow. Their first official website makes debut that spring as well. The sound of the early Snipers is quite unusual in its choice of violin (and sometimes flute) layered on the guitar riffs and rhythms, growing out of the acoustic traditions of Russian bards, and evoking some traditions of gypsy music, as well as some parallels with country music. The song content concerns mostly love and loss, and could be compared to early Ani DiFranco without the political overtones. Popularity In 2000 Albert Potapkin leaves the group, to be replaced by Ivan Ivolga and Sergei Sandovsky. Nochnye Snaipery give their first real international concerts in Germany and United States, where the group's popularity is assured by the large numbers of immigrant youth. After recording the album Rubezh (\\"Frontier\\"), their single Tridtsatpervaya Vesna (\\"31st Spring\\") enters rotation at one of the best known Russian radio stations \\"Nashe Radio\\", and by the fall of 2000, everyone in Russia has heard of the Night Snipers.–ù–æ—á–Ω—ã–µ —Å–Ω–∞–π–ø–µ—Ä—ã By December 2000 the ladies are signed by Real Records. 2001 is spent in touring around Russia and the Former Soviet Union. Dmitry Gorelov joins the band as the new drummer, and the Zhivoi (\\"Alive\\") album is recorded during a Christmas concert at \\"Barmalei\\" Club. The recording for Tsunami begins in Kiev in 2002, and proves to be fatal to the duo. A couple of days after the official release of the album in December 2002 Svetlana Surganova leaves the group, to later start a solo career with Surganova i Orkestr. Other events of note in 2002 include two tours of Israel and two large acoustic concerts ‚Äì in Moscow Art Theatre and St. Petersburg's Lensovet Palace of Culture. Dmitry Chestnykh joins the group as the new bassist, and another book of Surganova/Arbenina poetry is published - Patrontash. The Frontier/Tsunami period is much more grown up in its sound and structure. Political themes and questions about meaning of life make appearances in the lyrics; \\"Tridtsatpervaya Vesna\\" is to day possibly being the best known single of the group. The vocal structure is more dominated by Diana Arbenina, while in the early years the women sang about 50 percent of the repertoire in turn. The sound becomes harsher, more rock-oriented, with hard-driving drum lines and stylistic experiments. New Millennium The departure of Svetlana called for a radical change in the musical style of the band ‚Äì instead of replacing the string instruments with another musician, Snipers acquired a keyboardist (first Alexei Samarin, then Airat Sadykov). February 2003 saw the band give their largest yet concert at the famous Moscow sports arena Luzhniki. A new acoustic album Trigonometriya (\\"Trigonometry\\") is recorded during a concert at Moscow Art Theatre in May 2003. The band's 10th anniversary is celebrated with a large concert and a party at the B2 club. In the summer of 2004 Nochnye Snaipery performed at the \\"Russian Rock Night\\" festival in Berlin, and soon thereafter released a new electric album SMS. However, they carry on the acoustic tradition during concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg titled Superakustika (\\"Superacoustics\\"). In 2005 Diana Arbenina received a prestigious independent Russian award Triumph \\"for achievements in literature and the arts\\". In that same year Night Snipers collaborated with two very different musicians ‚Äì Japanese pop musician Kazufumi Miyazawa and Russian rock group Bi-2. The collaboration with Miyazawa was titled Simauta and let to the band's participation in Fuji Rock Festival, the first Russian group to do so. Another acoustic album Trigonometriya 2 is released in 2005 after a recording of a May 2005 concert at the Moscow Art Theatre, and the Japanese version of Koshika album is published. In the fall of 2005 Night Snipers travel to Switzerland, kicking off a tradition of yearly tours outside of Russia. Diana also published another book of lyrics and anti-songs Katastroficheski. In early 2006 Koshika album is released in Russia, and the band tours United States and Israel. Diana Arbenina performed in multiple memorial concerts as an acoustic solo musician, including Svoya Koleya (\\"Own Track\\"), commemorating Vladimir Vysotsky and In Memoriam Bulat Okudjava in Peredelkino. In early 2007 Nochnye Snaipery released their newest album Bonni i Klaid (\\"Bonnie & Clyde\\"), which includes some collaborative tracks with Bi-2 and draws inspiration from Western themes.

Dal Pontificato di Gregorio XII del 1572 in fino a‚Äô tempi di Papa Urbano VIII nel 1642 (\\"Lives of the painters, sculptors, architects, from the papacies of Gregory XII in 1572 to Urban VIII in 1642\\") is an art history book by Giovanni Baglione, first published in 1642. It represents an encyclopedic compendium of biographies of the artists active in Rome during late Mannerism and early Baroque. Baglione (1566 - 1643) was a Late Mannerist and Early Baroque painter and art historian, best remembered for his writings and his acrimonious involvement with the artist Caravaggio, by whom he was nonetheless greatly influenced. The book was first published in 1642, with a final version published in Naples in 1733, long after Baglione's death, with a biography of Salvator Rosa by Giovanni Battista Passeri as an appendix. The poet Ottavio Tronsarelli may have contributed a good deal of the text. The biographies are structured as a series of days (giornate) for each papacy, recalling the artists active in Rome during that time. Numerous errors are present, and Baglione's prejudices are often clear; however the book is regarded as a very valuable source from a well-placed observer of the Roman art world, who knew most of his subjects personally.

Fuchi has exclusively worked for All Japan since his debut in 1974, and holds the record for the longest World Junior Heavyweight Championship reign at 1309 days. Fuchi became a freelancer in 2009, but officially re-signed with AJPW in 2013 as both a director and wrestler, making him the longest tenured member of the All Japan roster.  Professional wrestling career   All Japan Pro Wrestling (1974‚Äìpresent)  With a background in amateur wrestling, Fuchi debuted as a professional wrestler on August 22, 1974 for AJPW, facing future Death Match innovator Atsushi Onita. For the next couple of years, Fuchi and Onita alternated between teaming and feuding on the opening bouts. In 1979, the two went on an excursion to Memphis, Tennessee to season their careers. Fuchi briefly worked for the NWA's Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling as a jobber who always showed a good account of himself. Following Onita's retirement in 1985 and Tiger Mask II's graduation to the heavyweight division in 1986, Fuchi became the top junior heavyweight star, holding the World Junior Heavyweight Championship on five occasions spanning over 11 years. Fuchi's third reign spanned 4 years (1989‚Äì1993), but the fact that AJPW was relatively closed off to outside competition factored heavily in his lengthy third reign. After losing the belt for the last time in 1996, Fuchi was relegated to the opening \\"legends\\" bouts, mostly in teams with Haruka Eigen opposing AJPW founder Giant Baba and Rusher Kimura. In 2000, when Mitsuharu Misawa defected from AJPW to form Pro Wrestling Noah, Fuchi was one of two (the other being Toshiaki Kawada) native wrestlers who remained with the promotion. As a result, Fuchi was pushed for a while into the upper regions of the card, teaming with Toshiaki Kawada and becoming a top contender for the World Tag Team Championship. Fuchi's first title in eight years was the All Asia Tag Team Championship with fellow veteran Genichiro Tenryu. Fuchi became a director for the promotion soon after the arrival of Keiji Mutoh, a position that Fuchi still holds to this day. Fuchi still competes on a full-time basis for All-Japan Pro Wrestling, but usually in comedic preliminary bouts against rookie heavyweights and junior heavyweights. On August 20, 2006, Fuchi became a member of the Voodoo Murders stable, competing under a red mask as Akaoni. His tenure as Akaoni and with the stable only lasted for that evening, as Fuchi unmasked and helped fellow All Japan competitors attack the stable following the main event. From November 23 to December 9, 2007, Fuchi teamed with Osamu Nishimura to compete in the World's Strongest Tag Determination League, finishing the league with 7 points (2 wins, 2 losses and 3 draws) and placing 5th overall. On June 21, 2013, it was revealed that Masanobu Fuchi had long since resigned from his position in the AJPW Board of Directors and hasn't had an exclusive contract since 2009 due to his age, thus becoming a freelancer, although he still wrestles for AJPW on a pay per performance basis. However, on July 14, during the launching event of the post-Keiji Mutoh All Japan, Fuchi appeared and announced that he had officially re-signed with the promotion not only as a wrestler, but also as a member of the Board of Directors, ending his tenure as a freelancer. Shortly afterwards, Fuchi also became the co-head booker of All Japan, alongside Jun Akiyama. On November 27, 2016, Fuchi and fellow first class graduate Atsushi Onita defeated Atsushi Aoki and Hikaru Sato to become the 100th All Asia Tag Team Champions. It was Fuchi's first title in 12 years, and the combination's first title in 35 years, since their third and last AWA Southern title reign in Memphis in 1981. They lost the title back to Aoki and Sato on June 20, 2017.

Miller received his early musical training at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore and the New England Conservatory in Boston. He also holds a BS degree in humanities and engineering from MIT and was awarded a Fulbright grant for music study in Amsterdam. While in Boston, he founded the Bubonic Bassoon Quartet and made the premier recording of the Hummel Bassoon Concerto, released along with the Weber Concerto on Cambridge Records. Miller assumed the position of principal bassoon of the Minnesota Orchestra in 1971, when he also joined the music faculty of the University of Minnesota. Since then, he has continued his solo career, performing numerous times with the Minnesota Orchestra, as well as many other orchestras. He has also presented master classes and recitals at many of the world‚Äôs major conservatories and music schools. In 2015, John Miller retired from his position with the Minnesota Orchestra after 44 years. As a farewell, the orchestra programmed a concerto for two bassoons, each movement performed with a different member of the bassoon section. For more than 20 years, Miller was a member of the American Reed Trio. Among his solo recordings are four concertos by Vivaldi and the Mozart and Wanhal bassoon concertos, all conducted by Sir Neville Marriner on two Pro Arte discs. He was featured in the 1968 Cambridge Records release of Hummel's Bassoon Concerto in F. His teachers have included Louis Skinner, Arthur Weisberg, Stanley Petrulis, Sherman Walt, Stephen Maxym, and Thom de Klerk. One of Miller‚Äôs educational activities, the Nordic Bassoon Symposium, begun in 1984 as the John Miller Bassoon Symposium, has attracted an international mix of hundreds of professional, student, and amateur bassoonists.

Feminization or feminisation (see spelling differences), sometimes forced feminization (shortened to forcefem or forced femme), and also known as sissification, is a practice in dominance and submission or kink subcultures, involving reversal of gender roles and making a submissive partner take on a feminine role, which may include cross-dressing. The feminized partner is sometimes called a \\"sissy\\". Subsets of the practice include \\"sissy training\\" and variations thereof, where the submissive partner is trained over time in femininity. Forced feminization is a very common sexual fantasy. Reasons for engaging in it as a submissive partner include having an outlet for femininity without feeling guilt over it, in a society that pressures men to be traditionally masculine, reinforcing their role in a BDSM role-play scenario through feeling vulnerable, or exploring their sexuality; dominant partners may enjoy bringing out their partner's \\"female persona\\". Feminization as a sexual fetish is not the same thing as being a transgender woman, and the submissive partners engaging in it are typically heterosexual, cisgender men. As a theme in art, forced feminization appears in literature, including erotic such, and in visual art such as photography and illustration. There also exists a combination of the two, where forced feminization captions are added to pictures to give them a new context. Forced feminization is also a popular theme in manga, wherein the feminization often happens as part of a curse or joke. Practice Feminization is a practice in dominance and submission or kink subcultures, which involves reversing gender roles, making a submissive partner ‚Äì typically a man ‚Äì take on a feminine role, often for humiliation- based sexual pleasure. This may include them cross-dressing in feminine clothing such as lingerie, acting in a feminine manner, getting referred to by a feminine name, having anal sex as the receptive partner, wearing prosthetic breasts, or tucking. People participating in feminization often role-play different scenarios based around the submissive partner's femininity or feminine clothes; these may include role-playing being caught in the act of trying on panties or lipstick, being discovered to be wearing frilly lingerie under their clothes, being a princess, being a \\"damsel in distress\\" and treated like a helpless woman, or being hired \\"as a woman\\" for a female-coded job like a nurse, cheerleader, sex worker, or businesswoman. HuffPost described one dominatrix's sissification sessions as involving humiliating the submissive by \\"parading them around\\" in high heels, make-up and lingerie; another dominatrix does her sessions by \\"cheerleading\\" men into exploring femininity. Despite being labeled as \\"forced\\" feminization, as the role-played scenario may involve that the submissive partner supposedly is feminized against their will, it is a fantasy that is agreed upon by its participants. Whereas not all participants are interested in BDSM aspects of the practice, and only enjoy dressing up, it may also include things such as spanking, pegging, bondage, and humiliation such as making fun of the submissive for having a small and soft penis, and referring to it as a clitoris. The feminized partner is sometimes called a \\"sissy\\", and may be said to have been \\"sissified\\".

A subset of feminization is \\"sissy training\\", wherein the dominant partner slowly over time trains the submissive in being a sissy, making them take on \\"ultra-feminine\\" behaviors and participate in feminine activities. As part of this, it is common for the sissy to cross-dress; to shave their body, including their genitals; wear make-up; and wear women's underwear, to appear more womanly. In extreme cases, the sissy may take medication or undergo surgery to become more feminine. Activities in sissy training involve non-sexual ones, such as applying make-up or cleaning the house, as well as sexual ones. A further sub-set is \\"sissy maid training\\", a common scenario, where the sissy takes on the role of a maid, taking care of housework or serving drinks and food at a party while behaving submissively and wearing an often frilly and revealing maid uniform, such as a French maid or rubber maid dress. The dominant partner in a sissy maid training scenario, overseeing the sissy's housework, may role-play punishing them with things such as spanking, humiliation or bondage, whether the infraction was real or made up; a reward for good behavior might be allowing the submissive to orgasm. Another common sub-set is \\"slut training\\", where the submissive partner is made to wear \\"slutty\\" feminine clothing that may reveal a lot of bare skin and show off the submissive's curves, while being teased or chided for being promiscuous or overly sexual. The training involves making the submissive ‚Äì who often may be shy and embarrassed ‚Äì overcome those emotions, shifting their mindset so that they instinctively act more provocatively and uninhibitedly. The training may include training the submissive to pose provocatively, such as spreading their buttocks or exposing their genitals, and making them instinctively assume certain such positions in certain situations. Background According to a HuffPost feature where sex workers were interviewed, including dominatrixes and escorts, forced feminization is one of the most common sexual fantasies among sex workers' clients: one dominatrix said that a vast majority of her clients want to be sissified. In Danielle J. Lindemann's Dominatrix, about a third of a sample of 305 sex worker clients were interested in being made to cross-dress. The fantasy is to a large degree practiced by heterosexual, cisgender men as the submissive partners, although Vice noted that there were also bisexual and pansexual men present at a feminization meet-up they reported on, as well as some genderfluid and transgender people. In slut training scenarios, the submissive partner is most commonly a woman. The dominant partner may likewise be of any gender; in sissy maid training scenarios, they are typically a woman. Kinkly describes the appeal of feminization as coming from the societal pressure on men to be traditionally masculine, and how being feminine can give men a feeling of guilt. When a man who is drawn to femininity does things considered feminine as part of a scenario where he is supposedly \\"forced\\" to do them, this may provide an outlet for his feelings while also giving him a relief of the guilt, since it within the fantasy is an outside force that caused him to do it; because of the stigma, it may still be difficult for either partner to bring up the subject, however, not knowing how the other will react to it. Some people also use feminization as a way to explore their sexuality. As a BDSM role-play practice, being feminized may appeal to the submissive through making them feel vulnerable and reinforcing their role. Dominant partners may enjoy feminization for getting to bring their submissive partner's \\"female persona\\" out, or for getting to erotically humiliating them for their lack of masculinity. In her book Fetish Sex, writer Violet Blue says that although the kink may seem like it is devaluing women from an outsider's perspective, submissive partners engaging in it often have a lot of respect for women. In Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures, Sabrina P. Ramet writes that although the fantasy may seem contradictory in its treatment of femininity as a source of humiliation, since it often is combined with femdom ‚Äì as one could assume that the submissive's feminine clothing would be a symbol of the female superiority within a femdom‚Äìfeminization role-play scenario ‚Äì the two fantasies are independent even within the role-play, with the humiliation coming from the cultural taboo of wearing women's clothing as a man. Feminization, as a sexual fetish, is very different from being a transgender woman; Ana Valens, writing for The Daily Dot, still describes forced feminization as a common fantasy among trans women, as the stigmatized need of trans women to be women, through feminization fantasies, can be met before a trans woman has admitted to having that need. As a theme in art Feminization has been used as a theme in fiction, which is commonly about a male character being forcibly feminized by a woman ‚Äì typically his wife or girlfriend, and typically as punishment for something ‚Äì before being forced by her into a situation where he needs to pass as a woman; variations include magical, bodily transformations rather than only cross-dressing. In erotic fiction, stories often involves situations where feminized characters are expected to perform fellatio. Feminization fiction is commonly published on the internet; FictionMania is an example of a popular website for the genre. It is also published in magazines, such as Forced Womanhood!, which is dedicated to publishing erotic forced feminization fiction and illustrations. Another form of feminization fiction is forced feminization captions added to pictures, which is sometimes done without the consent or approval of women whose photographs have been used. Some writers of feminization fiction use subscription services on the internet to finance their works, although this is sometimes met with resistance by the providers of the services due to the type of content; in 2019, Patreon was reported to have banned some types of erotic content from their services, including feminization and sissification stories where the transformation is depicted as forced. Visual artist R√≠o Sofia created a series of self portraits themed around forced feminization, influenced by the Forced Womanhood! magazine and sharing its name, which was well received; she was unsettled by the response, as her school used it to show how safe students supposedly felt to express themselves, whereas she had felt insecure and alienated there. Forced feminization was featured in an episode of the television drama series Law & Order: Criminal Intent, where a character was portrayed as a \\"weirdo transvestite\\"; in her book My Husband Betty, author Helen Boyd described it as completely different from how forced feminization fantasies and men who are interested in it are in reality. In Asia Forced feminization is a highly popular theme in manga and sells well across gender demographics, according to Japanese book retailer H≈çrind≈ç Takadanobaba. In these, the transformation is typically portrayed as the imposing of female gender roles on a character initially portrayed as male, as a joke or a curse, such as in Ranma ¬Ω and Boku Girl, two popular series whose protagonists' bodies are magically feminized against their will. These works often have transgender themes, and are sometimes referred to as ; although this label also includes masculinization stories, feminization makes up the majority. Feminization stories where the transformation takes the form of cross-dressing are called otokonoko, and are popular in Japan. Erotic manga on the theme have been around since the 1990s, but otokonoko manga remained a small niche until seeing a growth through the 2000s and 2010s; the popularization was helped by manga magazines like Waai! Boys in Skirts, which introduced otokonoko to a broader audience. In a 2019 report by Otapol, they described the genre as being smaller in China than in Japan, but still developing there. Erotic sissy stories in particular are still rare in manga, however, although Otapol expect the genre to grow as more people become comfortable with being open with their sexuality. Feminization and otokonoko are popular in Japanese video games, with games featuring otokonoko characters often selling well, and the otokonoko characters often becoming more popular than the female cast. Japanese games with such themes also have an international audience: according to Hajime Nishida, developer of the Josou line of otokonoko games, the international release of his Josou Jinja sold \\"amazingly well\\", with nearly half of buyers being from China. Other examples include the visual novel game X-Change, where high school student Takuya Aihara is bodily feminized through exposure to chemicals; the fighting game SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy, which features an all-female roster, where the character Terry Bogard appears after being feminized, with feminine clothing options including a cheerleader outfit; and Guilty Gear, a fighting game series where the character Bridget, a male bounty hunter, dresses like a nun. Bridget in particular has become an iconic otokonoko video game character, owing his wide appeal to his mix of maleness and femininity, and is a popular subject for cosplayers regardless of gender.

JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/jfemistudreli.27.1.75.  Definition of feminization  Feminization has two basic meanings. The first concerns a person who was not initially feminine but becomes feminine later in their life through the perceptions of both the individual and those around them. According to gender theorist Judith Butler, a person's gender is not solely an act of will or self-description, as it is also shaped by the people who describe, categorize, and treat the person according to their own perceptions of their gender. The second meaning of the term feminization describes when a person who originally had feminine qualities begins to incorporate more feminine attributes into their personality in some way, shape, or form. The term has often been used to describe females, however over time it shifted to where the term can be used to describe the process of someone or something becoming more feminine by adopting feminine qualities. Woman in suit  Feminization of poverty  Women are more likely than men to live below the poverty line, a phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty. The 2015 poverty rates for men and women in the U.S. were 10% and 15% respectively. Women are less likely to pursue advanced degrees and tend to have low paying jobs. It has been argued that there is a gender pay gap: even with the same level of education and occupational role, women earn much less than men, whether due to discrimination or to differences in choices.  Feminization of the labor force  Feminization of the labor force in present- day associations is inescapable in that females make up half of the labor force and the revelation of them as a potential profitable asset. Post-war, there have been considerable advances in balancing the workforce when comparing women and men's job status and pay rates in the North America and Europe economies.

Pennydale is that part of Cheltenham lying between Bay Road to the north, Jack Road to the west, Park Road to the south, and the Frankston railway line, and is entirely within the local government area of the City of Bayside. To the north-east of Pennydale, on the opposite side of the railway line and within Cheltenham, is the Westfield Southland shopping centre, which was opened in 1968. It has been expanded in a number of stages over the years, including a bridge, containing shops, across the Nepean Highway. History - Edwin Thomas Penny The name Pennydale began its use in the early part of the 20th Century due to the joining of the name of the prominent family living on the site ‚Äì the Penny family ‚Äì and the name \\"dale\\" being an old English word meaning \\"valley\\". The Penny family ‚Äì and Edwin Thomas Penny specifically, were so highly regarded in the community that they began calling the area Pennydale as a sign of endearment since the land itself used by the family for fruit and vegetable growing sat in a large valley from Tulip Grove being the highest land in the area, towards the bay. The name became used by family and friends as well as other local residents who moved into the area both during ET Penny's life, but more-so after he had passed away suddenly on 9 December 1916 aged just 67. A newspaper article in the Oakleigh Leader 27 October 1894 page 5 on Penny and his orchards stated about Cheltenham that \\"the township, by the way, is named after the well known watering place in England, and is sheltered by hills the same as in the old country.\\" This then is the genesis of the Dale section of the name. (Oakleigh Leader Oct 27 1894 page 5). The name Pennydale was introduced officially when a post office was established in the Bay Road East shopping centre on 3 March 1956. The Post office ‚Äì located at 360 Bay Road - was opened by the Post Master General as a means of avoiding confusion in deliveries between the Cheltenham and the Highett Post Offices. The official postal address at that time was \\"Pennydale S22\\". When the system changed to using Post Codes, Pennydale used the same Post Code as Cheltenham being 3192. On 27 October 1993 the Post Office became a Licensed Post Office and it ran as such until it closed down on 25 August 1999. The reason for the closure was that a new post office had opened within the Southland Shopping Centre and it was deemed that the Pennydale Post Office was no longer required. Following the closure of the post office, many residents have continued using the name since that time, and letters addressed to Pennydale 3192 are still being delivered even today. As stated, the name Pennydale was chosen in the 1950s to avoid confusion with post offices in Highett and Cheltenham. It was proposed by Cr Everest A Le Page (Moorabbin City Council) that the new post office be named in recognition of the contribution of Edwin Thomas Penny, a man that had been a friend of both his Father and his Grandfather in the district as it opened up as well as a fellow Councillor and Mayor of the Shire. This nomination was made following a request from the Post Master Generals Office for the council to suggest a suitable name. Cr Le Page also noted that Edwin Penny had primarily been responsible for the South African Boer War Memorial in Cheltenham. A member of the Penny Family is listed as a returned soldier on that monument (L W 4 Penny). The memorial was placed on the corner of Charman Road and the Point Nepean Road and originally was built with 2 wonderful lamps and a drinking fountain. The Moorabbin Council surveyed residents in the area, who agreed with the name Pennydale as many residents already used that name at the time anyway. In 2006, Bayside Council began the process of formally naming all unnamed parks in the Bayside Municipality. The park in Olympic Avenue beside the Kindergarten had been there since the early days and Council asked residents to come up with a name for the park. A number of suggestions were put forward to Council who looked at each one and in the end agreed to name the park Pennydale Park following a higher number of votes for that name and because that names was already unofficially in use by sections of the community already. The park was officially named Pennydale Park and Bayside Council erected a park sign facing Olympic Avenue stating \\"In 1958 the postal area between Park Road and Bay Road was named 'Pennydale', in recognition of the Penny family who settled in the area in 1862.\\". This sign is still in place and is a recognition not only of the name Pennydale, but of the Penny family and their long history with the area. Bayside Council registered the name with VICNAMES ‚Äì The Register of Geographic Names Victorian State Government - Registered Place Name ID VIC100049, and in 2015 it went further and registered the reason for the name as printed on the park sign so that there was a registration of the Pennydale name. It was with this history in mind that the Pennydale Residents Action Group was formed and the process to officially change the name to Pennydale begun. The name ‚ÄòPennydale‚Äô recognises the contribution of the Penny family who have lived in the area since the 1850s, and in particular recognises the contribution of local identity Edwin Thomas (ET) Penny (1849 ‚Äì 1916), who was a Moorabbin Shire Councillor from 1893 to 1908, and President of the Shire of Moorabbin from 1898 to 1900). Thomas Millard Penny (1821 ‚Äì 1866), the father of Edwin Thomas Penny, took up 10 acres of land for farming in Bay Road Cheltenham in 1853 soon after arriving in the district and making a home in Charman Road. In 1862 Thomas Penny reserved a further 3 acres of the land on Bay road (later mentioned as Jack road) for an orchard, and the balance for vegetable cultivation. His son Edwin Thomas (ET) Penny focused more on fruit growing adopting a ‚Äòscientific approach‚Äô. He grew apples, pears, peaches and plums, as well and trialing innovative fruits including persimmon, passionfruit and gooseberry. A newspaper article from the era states that ‚ÄòCr Edwin Penny is a gardener and orchardist of the new school ...he has broken away from the old groove.‚Äô Edwin Penny was one of over 120 witnesses who presented information at the 1915 Royal Commission on Fruit, Vegetables and Jam. The report on that Commission notes that Edwin Penny was a fruit grower and market gardener with around 25 acres, including 20 acres of orchards and vegetables grown between the trees. ET Penny was a prominent figure in many local institutions, as well as being on the directorate of the Market Gardeners' Association. (Oakleigh Leader, Saturday 27 October 1894) (Brighton Southern Cross, Saturday 28 March 1908) (Article 225 Rate Book Extract for Road District of Moorabbin 1862 City of Kingston Historical Website) (Victoria Royal Commission on Fruit, Vegetables and Jam, Minutes of Evidence, 1915, page 179). (Obituary for Edwin Thomas Penny, Brighton Southern Cross Sat 16th Dec 1916) Edwin Thomas Penny was elected to the Moorabbin Shire Council in 1893 serving as the Mayor from 1898 to 1900. Upon his election to Mayor, the Brighton Southern Cross mentioned that \\"In the 5 years since his election to Council he has always taken a leading part in its deliberations and is devoted to the best interests to the ratepayers of the riding.\\" The article went on to say that Penny \\"was a valued member of the local Board of Advice, he has always been prominent in matters relating to the welfare of rising generation of Moorabbinites\\". It goes on to say that Penny \\"has devoted time and attention to the formation of the new Cheltenham recreation ground being a committee member. He has always been in immediate touch with any movement bought forward for the advancement of the district and is very popular with both young and old.\\" On 7 August 1905 Councillor Penny addressed an audience at the Mechanics institute whilst seeking re-election for a further 3 years. He told the congregation that in the past 12 years he had only missed 4 of the 300 meetings and had kept his promise to do his best for the Riding and the Shire. Penny was re-elected for a further 3 years. Penny served on Council for 15 years in total, losing the last election by a mere 26 votes. ET Penny's contribution to the Shire as a Councillor was acknowledged at a large gathering held at the Mechanics' Institute Mordialloc, in November 1908. The event was held ‚Äòfor the purpose of showing their recognition of the valuable services rendered by ex-Cr. Penny during his 15 years representation of the South Riding of the Shire of Moorabbin‚Äô. It was recorded that Penny was ‚Äòone of the best known men in Moorabbin‚Äô, and ‚Äòhad taken a leading part in its growth as a producing centre, and in its public, church and social life‚Äô. It was further recorded that 'his property reportedly had frontages to Tulip, Jack and Bay Roads'. Edwin Penny was presented with a ring and his wife with an epergne. In his reply Edwin Penny noted that ‚Äòhe had lived in the shire for 54 years and had watched it grow from a wilderness to the beauty spot of Victoria‚Äô. (Brighton Southern Cross September 17, 1898 page 2) (Brighton Southern Cross August 12, 1905 page 2). (Brighton Southern Cross, Saturday 7 November 1908, page 4) In 1889 ET Penny was a co-founder of the Cheltenham Rifle Club along with Frank LePage and others. At various times he was the President and he continued to be a member of the club until his death in 1916. The Cheltenham Rifle club operated out of Cheltenham Park where a rifle range was set up and continued until the area began to really settle. The rifle club continued operations at both Cheltenham Park and then at Langwarrin at least until the 1930s when both the districts began to be built on. (LePage Article Ref 201 ‚Äì Kingston Historical Website)(Victorian Municipal Directory 1933)(Graham Whitehead, Article 390 City of Kingston Historical Website) ET Penny was also one of the Directors of the Cheltenham Creamery and Butter Factory which operated between 1895 and 1905. The Factory marketed a brand of butter known as ‚ÄúGilt Edge,‚Äù well known at that time throughout the entire state. Penny was one of the original committee and when land was found and the Creamery preparing to get underway, a company was formed to run the Creamery with Penny, Allnutt and Wilson elected as Directors of the company. The cutting of the butter into one pound pats was not easy until one of the chaps invented the first butter cutter, a series of wires which became known as the ‚ÄòInvicta Butter Cutter‚Äô. (Whitehead, G. J. The Cheltenham Creamery and Butter Factory, Article Ref. 259, City of Kingston Historical Website)(Everest LePage, Article 201, City of Kingston Historical Website) (Caulfield and Elsternwick Leader January 26, 1895 page 5)(Tom M. Farmilo, Senior Horticultural Adviser ‚Äì Vegetables (first published in the ‚ÄúVictorian Vegetable Growers‚Äô Digest‚Äù,summer, 1970 now available on the Ausvegvic.com.au website) ET Penny was a Chairman of the Moorabbin Board of Advice for State School in Cheltenham, Moorabbin, Mentone, Heatherton and Mordialloc amongst others after being duly elected by the ratepayers residing in the school district for a period of 3 years from 1899 to 1901. The Board of Advice was a forerunner to today's School Councils. School Advice Boards were abolished in 1910 and replaced by School Committees that became School Councils. On 9 May 1901 Penny, together with the Reverend Alfred Caffin, attended the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament at the Melbourne Exhibition Buildings, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York and their son Edward presided over the opening. Councillor Penny attended the event and took a \\"Prominent Part\\" in the welcome to the Duke and Duchess. As part of his position as Chairman of the Board of Advice for the district, Penny attended with students from the local schools who took part in tableaus and displays in the forecourts of the Exhibition Buildings. A few days earlier, an afternoon assembly was held at Cheltenham State School hoisting the Union Jack onto a brand new Flagpole (still in place) and \\"The Grand Old Flag\\" was sung before Councillor Penny and others made speeches to the assembled students and faculty. On 14 May a coordinated flag raising ceremony was held at each of the district state schools and the flag was saluted. At Cheltenham State School, the Moorabbin Brass Band accompanied the singing of the National Anthem and the Cheltenham Rifle club provided a 21 gun salute followed by Councillor Penny who addressed the children on their duties to the flag and Empire then distributed to the teachers and scholars the Commonwealth medals struck by the Government for the Occasion that were handed out to all students. (Brighton Southern Cross (Vic. : 1896 ‚Äì 1918), Saturday 4 May 1901, page 2) (Graham Whitehead ‚Äì Reference 100 City of Kingston Historical Website) (Brighton Southern Cross (Vic. : 1896 ‚Äì 1918), Saturday 18 May 1901, page 2) (Education Act 1872 Act number 447) (Author Deborah Tout-Smith ‚Äì https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/1933) (Graham Whitehead ‚Äì Ref 100 City of Kingston Historical Website) (Caulfield and Elsternwick Leader February 11, 1899 page 2) In April 1901 ET Penny was inducted as a Justice of the Peace and served on the bench at the Cheltenham Court until his death in 1916. Being a Justice of the Peace was equivalent to being a Magistrate today. ET Penny sat on the bench with a number of other well-known people from the region. He heard many cases over his years serving including fining people for public drunkenness, failure to pay rates, wilful assault, failure to immunise children, failure to send children to school and even Murder. ET Penny was a man for the people and he treated everybody with respect and dignity. On 18 August 1887 a meeting was held at the Cheltenham Protestant hall to discuss the situation causing concern in the region ‚Äì that being a large influx of Chinese into Victoria. The concern arose due to the Chinese taking on labour jobs at lower wages that other locals who missed out on the work and income. The Victorian Colonial Government saw what was happening and passed a law in 1855 to try to stem this tide but it failed and many Chinese came to the Victorian goldfields to find their wealth. After the gold began to get harder to find, many Chinese sought jobs throughout the metropolitan regions including the Cheltenham area. Whilst the tone of the meeting was protection of lands and wages, there was some who were simply looking at blaming the Chinese immigrants for their lot in life and began to spout anti-Chinese sentiment. ET Penny spoke up in support of the Chinese at the Cheltenham meeting while recognizing their numbers were likely to increase stating \\"They must not be ill-treated and we must look after them. When they lease our soil they have as much right to it as anyone else and the law must protect them. There were good Chinese and he would sooner trust them with ¬£5 than many Europeans.\\" Penny went on to say that if the community was to succeed people must be content to sacrifice a little at present for the good of the future and the welfare of the children. (Graham Whitehead. Article 322 City of Kingston Historical Website) (Brighton Southern Cross, August 27, 1887) ET Penny was involved in the establishment of Cheltenham's first cricket ground. The first ground was on land just behind the Eastern side of Charman Road but it was clear that pressures to build would mean this would be lost. A committee was setup including Penny to lobby for land to build a new Cricket Ground and football Ground and in 1894 this occurred on Weatherall Road, a ground that is still there and in use for the same purposes today. (Graham Whitehead Article 273, 289 & 390 City of Kingston Historical Website) ET Penny was involved in the life of the Cheltenham Church of Christ for the period of time he lived in the area, helping to get the Cheltenham Church of Christ built in the first place in 1887. He regularly took and ran the Sunday School program as the Superintendent and at times when the pastor was away, Penny ran the Sunday services in place of the Pastor as the Preacher which he did regularly, sometimes for weeks or months at a time. In 1920, 4 years after his death, a new hall was constructed for the Kindergarten and named the \\"E.T. Penny Memorial\\" in recognition of his service to the Church including signal service for the Church and Brotherhood, especially in Youth Services. (80th Anniversary Souvenir History of the Church of Christ Cheltenham Victoria)(Brighton Southern Cross August 11, 1900 page 2) (Moorabbin News Jan 10 1914 page 1) Penny was one of the founding members of the local division of the Sons of Temperance group (Star of Moorabbin Division No29.), a friendly society aimed to assist members and their families at times of unemployment, illness and death. He served in many roles in the group including starting off as Assistant Conductor but also taking on the roles of Worthy Patriarch, Recording Scribe and Conductor. The Sons of Temperance was absorbed into the Independent Order of Oddfellows (IOOF) which subsequently became part of NIB Health Funds. Whilst unable to drink alcohol as a member of the Temperance Society, Penny did actually get in trouble once for doing so. Whilst not a drinker, Penny and his family regularly attended the Exchange Hotel (now the Tudor inn) on the Point Nepean Road for meals and meetings, creating a pathway through the area. When the railway line was built in 1881, the Penny's kept using the same pathways, creating a crossing over the line at what is now Heather Grove. When Vic Rail formalised all crossings in the 1950s, this crossing point was retained as it had grown in usage thanks largely to the walking habits of the Penny family (Graham Whitehead. Article 647 City of Kingston Historical Website) (Penny family history) Penny contributed to the operations of many community groups including The Melbourne Benevolent Asylum, The Cheltenham Mechanics Institute and The Moorabbin Rural Industries Association. In 1880 when it became obvious that the Victorian Benevolent Society property in North Melbourne was in need of replacement, the State Premier agreed in 1890 to grant land of 150 acres in Cheltenham to move the asylum to. In 1905 as a Councillor of the Shire, and a good Christian, Penny led the drive to get the project moving. Penny was involved in the Moorabbin Horticultural, Poultry and Dog Society for many years including serving as its vice president and President. Penny one of those responsible for the inauguration of the Society on 26 October 1898 in which he was elected as a vice president. Penny was also one of those committee members who drafted the rules and constitution for the club. On 24 July 1907, a deputation from the Horticultural Society including Penny met with the Minister of Agriculture asking for the establishment of a plot of land to use as an Experimental farm for growing of vegetables. It was agreed to set up a farm to grow produce used for scenting (perfumes etc.). In February 1909 the Horticultural society met to congratulate the fact the Scent farm was up and running and experts from the Department of Agriculture were present to talk to the market gardeners about the project.

The new building was an imposing structure and Penny had lengthened the sea wall to permit deep sea bathing, erected a large concert hall and provision had been made for hot sea water baths. Following his death in 1916, the Penny family connection to the baths continued through the generations. Clifford Frederick Penny (1885 ‚Äì 1924), one of Edwin Thomas and Sarah Ann Penny's youngest son married Ethel Annie Carter at the family home in Jack Road Cheltenham in 1910. They started married life as proprietors of the newly renovated Brighton Beach Sea Baths, originally built in 1867. Clifford died on his 39th birthday leaving a wife and 3 young children. Ethel managed to continue running the ‚ÄòPenny‚Äô Baths as they were known for another 3 years and was the owner of property in Churchill Avenue, Cheltenham. The Brighton Council took over the running of the baths in 1928. (Penny, E. 1996. Reflections. As told by Ernie Penny to his daughter Brenda Kennedy) (Graham Whitehead Article 660 City of Kingston Historical Website) (The Argus 7 May 1910 page 21.) (The Age 29 November 1910.) On 9 December 1916 Penny was working on his property in the morning but when in the afternoon he felt ill and took a rest on his veranda. Shortly afterwards he had a violent vomiting attack and the doctor was called. After a short period of stabilisation, Penny died soon after. The official reports were that the death was caused by Shock, Cardiac syncope (fainting due to low blood pressure) and internal ruptures. The sad news of Penny's passing swept far and wide and was reported in the local area, the region and even interstate. Edwin Penny was buried at Cheltenham Cemetery on Monday 11 December 1916 after a brief service at his beloved Church of Christ where he was due to preach the day following his death. The service at the graveside was curtailed due to foul weather but regardless was very largely attended. A memorial service was subsequently held at the Church. The pall bearers for the coffin was a who's who of the region with names such as Allnutt, LePage, Laver, Brownfield, Butler, Marriott and Davie and the Coffin Bearers were Wolf, Barnett, Daff, Hayes, Simpson and Bodsworth. Edwin Penny was interred with his first wife Sarah Ann and their second son Percival Thomas and later in 1937 his second wife Emily Maria was also interred with them. They can be found at the Cheltenham Memorial Cemetery in the Church of Christ Section of the Cemetery in Section A Grave 72. Edwin Penny's obituaries said a lot about the man and his standing in the community. It was said that he was a \\"prominent figure in many local institutions as well as being on the Directorate of the Market Gardener‚Äôs Association.\\" Another newspaper stated that he was \\"also of the committee of the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum, Horticultural Society and many smaller local bodies\\" and that he \\"took an active part in Church and Temperance work and was announced to preach yesterday in the pulpit of the Church of Christ of which he was one of the Founders.\\" At the following Council meeting on Monday 18 December the President Councillor W. Kelly said of Penny \\"that for all the years he knew Penny he always found him to be a strictly honest, upright and honourable man.\\", going on to say that \\"like the late Councillor Burgess, God had sent him specially to the district to be an example to the people to follow.\\" He went on to say that Penny was a \\"generous man, always ready to give advice and assistance in anything that was going on.\\" He further states that \\"whilst in the Council he performed very good work. He was a good Churchman but was not what one might call a wowser.\\" Kelly moved a motion that a letter of sympathy be forwarded to Penny's widow and family. Councillor LePage seconded the motion and said \\"that during the years Penny occupied a seat at the Council table he did his duty honestly and fearlessly.\\" The motion was carried in silence. The Moorabbin News reported Penny's death by stating that \\"he had lived in the district nearly his entire life\\" and that \\"To say that he was respected and esteemed is insufficient, he was beloved by a whole circle of friends and relatives and was the honoured confidant of many peoples troubles and difficulties\\". It went on to say that \\"he invariably assisted all deserving cases, was generous giver to all public appeals and innumerable private ones\\" and then finishes off by stating that \\"in fact, it will be only by his death that one will be able to realise the extent of his usefulness.\\". The article goes on to say that Penny took a prominent part in all Church and Temperance work and that not only had he been associated with the Church of Christ for the whole of his life but that he \\"occupied the pulpit not only occasional, but for weeks and months at a time when the Church was without a resident preacher.\\" The author goes on to state that Penny was \\"connected with local societies far too numerous to mention\\" and that \\"his guidance was sought by many and refused by none.\\" Yet another local newspaper said of Penny's passing \\"The Moorabbin District has lost another of its leading residents.\\" At its Annual meeting in January 1917, the Cheltenham Mechanics Institute showed its sorrow at the loss of its president and long standing member Penny, and a resolution was adopted placing on the records of the Institute \\"the appreciation of the subscribers of the good work done by Penny during his long connection with the Institute.\\" (Sandringham Southern Cross December 16, 1916 page 5)(The Age December 11, 1916 page 8)(Brighton Southern Cross December 16, 1916 page 5)(Brighton Southern Cross December 23, 1916 page 2)(Moorabbin News December 16, 1916 page 4)(Seaside News January 13, 1917 page 4)(Weekly Times December 16, 1916 page 24) The Pennydale Residents Action Group The Pennydale Residents Action Group (PRAG) was formed in March 2017, in response to concerns about the proposed Structure Plan developed by Bayside Council. Those concerns included the use of the term \\"Southland Structure Plan\\". Many residents felt that the reference to Southland created an inappropriate expectation, treating a residential area, with narrow streets unsuited to medium and high density development, as a potential commercial hub. PRAG is supported by a broad base of volunteers, and an online social media group with more than 540 members. Community discussion via social media resolved to reclaim the name Pennydale, which had been applied to the locality since the second half of the 20th century. The aim was to draw attention to the distinctive neighbourhood character and to seek to retain it. Proponents felt that changing the name of the suburb to Pennydale would give that section of Bayside a unique identity which residents could feel proud of. PRAG continues to advocate on behalf of the Pennydale community via constant interaction with bodies such as Bayside Council, Kingston Council, The Level Crossing Removal Project (LXRP), Vic Roads and others. Through its ongoing relationships, it has helped work towards changes throughout the Pennydale area including a new footpath in Charlton Avenue, paving of the Erskine Avenue Laneway in conjunction with the local residents, upgrading of the facilities at Pennydale Park including fencing, shade-clothes and other changes, the installation of a Children's Crossing on Park Road near the railway line to assist students crossing the road to Cheltenham Primary School, Objections to inappropriate developments, protection of trees on both Council and private property, plus ongoing liaison with the LXRP through two of its members on the Community Reference Group (CRG)to assist in making the level crossing removal process less of a burden to the community, plus other things as well. PRAG is also involved in other direct items in the Pennydale community including annual Christmas Sausage Sizzle get-together, Neighbourhood Watch (NHW) Pennydale, graffiti-busting activities and more. Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic PRAG has arranged or taken part in multiple activities to help get through the lockdown including Barry the Gnome on the Roam roving garden gnome, Bin Isolation outings, Teddy Bears hunt in windows, Trivia nights, Isolation Movie club and more. PRAG is in constant contact with Bayside Council regarding the Pennydale name change process as well as the Pennydale structure plan process plus many other items. PRAG reports to the residents via the Pennydale Petition Facebook page, via an email group, and when necessary via local flyer delivery direct to all letterboxes throughout Pennydale. PRAG operates the community Facebook page Pennydale Petition which is a closed group only for members of the Pennydale community to use with membership strictly allowed only for those who live in Pennydale. This page is used for members to discuss things pertaining to Pennydale without external pressures. As at June 2020 the page has a membership of 779. The Pennydale Petition - Name Change Process After discussions with council staff, it was decided to formally seek the approval of residents for an official change the name of the area from Cheltenham to Pennydale. PRAG distributed a petition, which ran from 29 May to 19 June 2017, to every household in the relevant area. More than 61% agreed to the name change, with fewer than 4% either being against it or declining to take part. Given the support of the community, PRAG lodged the required documents with Bayside Council on 20 June 2017. At a council meeting on 27 June, the petition was formally tabled. It was unanimously agreed that the name of the proposed Structure Plan would be amended from \\"Southland Structure Plan\\" to \\"Southland / Pennydale Structure Plan\\". On 25 July, council officers recommended to the council that work be done to see if the name change was feasible, including a check with the Office of Geographic Names. Council voted unanimously to proceed, noting that the process could take up to a year. On 9 November 2017, Council began sending ballots to all relevant residents and property owners, asking whether they approved of the name change. The ballot paper required voters to mark a \\"Yes\\" or a \\"No\\" box, and to say why they had made that decision. The two-month voting period closed on 8 January 2018. There was criticism of the material sent out by Bayside Council because it had excluded residences on the west side of Jack Road from the proposed Pennydale area, despite the original Pennydale petition including them. Council eventually agreed to allow residents on the west side of Jack road to collect a separate petition. After it had been signed by the appropriate number of people as determined by Council, those residents were hand-delivered their ballots, and given until 12 February 2018 to vote. At the 22 March council meeting, it was revealed 51% of residents had voted, and that 85% of those in the \\"main\\" part of Pennydale, and 67% of those west Jack Road, had voted for the name change. The total \\"yes\\" vote was 523 and the total \\"no\\" vote was 101. Councillors voted unanimously to allow the name change to proceed and agreed to send a request to the Office of Geographic Names (OGN) to effect the name change. On 19 July 2018, Bayside Council received a letter from the Registrar of Geographic Names, Craig Sandy, advising that with the information supplied to them at this time, the OGN could not support the name change to Pennydale, advising that Council resubmit the proposal with further explanatory information that was not present in the initial set of documentation. The OGN advised that this was not an abnormal set of circumstances to occur and was expected due to Council's first name change request like this. It noted that with the information it did have from the initial documentation, Council could request an addition of Pennydale as a locality name (still to be called Pennydale and still using the same postcode 3192), or it could resubmit a full request including the information that the OGN requested and the process would continue. After discussions with PRAG, further information was sent to Bayside Council as requested and this information was bundled together with Councils further information and a revised request was sent back to the OGN in September. In May 2020, after multiple requests for updates to the process which was expected to take up to 18 months or more, it was discovered that a communications breakdown had occurred between Bayside Council and the OGN that neither body was aware of and as such the name change process had stalled. It was discovered that a change had occurred in the lodgement system that meant that documentation sent by Council to the OGN had not been received and the OGN had believed the council was still looking to lodge it. Once this issue was detected, Bayside Council re-lodged all of the revised documentation via the requested communications channel on Friday 15 May 2020 , the decision is back in the hands of the OGN awaiting action. The Pennydale Structure Plan Early in 2017, Bayside Council decided to develop the Southland Structure Plan, which included the Pennydale area. Residents of that area were concerned that the name would not only be confusing, but diminish participation due to the belief it had nothing to do with them. They persuaded Council to change the name to the Southland / Pennydale Structure Plan to better reflect its purpose. Council hired \\"Deliberately Engaging\\" to recruit 40 people to form a \\"Cheltenham / Pennydale Advisory Group\\", to give input into the plan. 20 people were recruited by email requests to residents. The other 20 were chosen from the community directly, to ensure an appropriate mix of sexes, ages and socio-economic status. The group met seven times, including an additional meeting requested by the members to look at the draft plan before it was made public. On 11 October 2017, members of the Advisory Group were shown the first draft of a basic plan. Despite their opposition to the document, they were asked not to say anything until community consultation meetings on 21 October and 25 October. At the first consultation meeting, three options were put: Option 1 was no change, Option 2 allowed for buildings of up to four storeys, and Option 3 allowed for seven-storey buildings. The reaction was so negative that the Council decided to delete Option 3. On 5 March 2018, Council released the Draft Structure Plan for consultation until 8 April. Three drop-in sessions were run, and residents affected were mailed a brochure advising them of the process and how to make their views known. At the final meeting of the Advisory Group, it was revealed that 82% of respondents wanted the boundary of the Southland Major Activity Centre to remain along the Frankston railway line. 82% did not want apartment buildings in the Bay Road, Park Road or Tulip Grove areas. 68% did not want a new crossing on Bay road under the rail bridge. 68% said no to opening a Tulip Grove entrance to Southland railway station. 80% wanted a shared user path along the railway line. 77% wanted a bike path along the south side of Park Road. 69% did not want a bike path along Bay Road. 68% said no to a bike path along Jack road. 82% wanted all developments to include the required amount of car parking. 85% said they wanted lane problem on Bay Road fixed. 61% did not want traffic lights on the corner of Jack Road and Park Road, but 63% wanted traffic lights on the corner of Jack road and Bay road. 87% wanted to maintain the \\"leafy\\" character of streets through planting and landscaping. Three options were then proposed by Council officers: 1) Abandoning the structure plan altogether (Councils best option); 2)Keeping the structure plan with the boundary of the Southland Major Activity Centre covering all of Pennydale and making minor changes, listing that option as not acceptable to residents; and 3) Keeping the structure plan with the boundary of the Southland Major Activity Centre to stay along the railway line although making minor changes, also listing that as unacceptable to residents. Against the advice of council officers, the Advisory Group added a fourth option, being to continue with the Structure Plan but leaving the boundary along the railway line and making major changes to the draft plan. Using the results of the survey, the Advisory Group developed a document to be given to the council to be used to make a decision about whether to proceed with the structure plan or not, which was to be made by Council prior its August meeting. In June 2018, council officers announced they were releasing a final draft of the Structure Plan to be voted on at the June Council meeting. Many Pennydale residents were concerned that their views were not reflected in the document, although Council agreed to kept Pennydale out of major activity centre along the Frankston railway line. Council did decide that the plan would be renamed the Pennydale Structure Plan, but that more work needed to be done, and a final vote was delayed until the August Council meeting. Members of PRAG met members of the council team responsible for the Structure plan several times and corresponded by email. PRAG was pleased that the Council officers wanted to ensure that every one was happy with the final version. By the end of the process, it was felt that the majority of residents would accept the outcome. On 31 August, Council released the final version of the draft, with a two-week consultation period. In October 2018 Council resolved to adopt the Pennydale Structure Plan and commence the Planning Scheme Amendments. Council adopted the final version of the structure plan after it was updated with additional suggestions from the community. The Bayside Council adopted Pennydale Structure Plan can be found here. This page also contains a copy of the changes made to the original version and a copy of the minutes of the meetings between Bayside Council and PRAG. On 3 January 2019, Bayside Council submitted the Pennydale Structure Plan (Bayside Planning Scheme Amendment C163) to the Department of Land, Water, Environment and Planning (DELWP) and began awaiting authorisation to commence exhibition of the amendment to the public.This process can take quite a lot of time depending upon the work load of the Government Department and the complexity of the Structure Plan to be looked at. As At June 2020, there has been no response to the Amendment C163 lodgement by Bayside Council, however the Minister has responded to a number of other Bayside Planning Scheme Amendments including Amendment C151 Hampton East Structure Plan, Amendment C152 Martin Street Structure Plan and amendment C162 Highett Structure Plan. On 30 April 2020, The Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning (DELWP) wrote to Bayside Council advising that they had refused authorisation of Amendment C163. The reasons for refusal were given as: \\\\- The proposed amendment would not suitably implement the relevant sections of Plan Melbourne 2017‚Äì2050, the Bayside Housing Strategy 2012 and the Planning Policy Framework as the amendment does not adequately focus growth in an area close to jobs, services and transport or respond to the strategic and physical context of the area; and \\\\- Modelling of the ResCode variations proposed by the new zones (GRZ 9,10 and 11) shows that the development potential of the majority of lots affected by the amendment will be limited to two-storeys which limits the potential for development to achieve a three-storey built form. The response also contained 3 options for Bayside Council to follow: \\\\- Abandon the Structure Plan in its entirety; \\\\- Review the Structure Plan; or \\\\- Not include the Structure Plan in the Planning Scheme, but retain the Structure Plan as an adopted Council document. Council wrote to the Pennydale Community and those registered showing interest on July 8, 2020 advising them of this decision from DELWP and advised that Council would consider the options for managing the growth and future development of the Pennydale area and would decide upon the option at its upcoming August 18, 2020 Ordinary Council Meeting. On July 28, 2020 at the Bayside Council's Ordinary Council Meeting, a petition from 25 Bayside residents calling for the Pennydale Structure Plan to be abandoned and that in its place a new \\"Cheltenham-Southland (Bayside) Structure Plan\\" be implemented \\"in conformity with Plan Melbourne 2017-2050, the Bayside Housing Strategy and the Bayside Planning Scheme objectives, and community requirements for safe, convenient and sustainable access to Activity Centres and public transport\\", and that \\"The CSBSP would replace the Pennydale plan rejected by Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) 30 April 2020\\". The petition sought to request that Bayside Council commence immediately to develop a new structure plan reflecting the majority of community views; a well planned increase in residential density; commence work on a Shared User Path (SUP) from Cheltenham to Sandringham starting along Park Road by requesting the Minister for Transport to instruct the LXRP to begin the initial construct; request the Minister for Transport to instruct the LXRP to extend the SUP from Heather Grove to Southland with a bridge over Bay Road and to have this work added into the current LXRP works and have this commenced right away; and to request the Minister of Transport to instruct the LXRP to extend the path adjacent to Heather Grove North with a ramp to the Southern end of Platform 1 with drop off point for seniors people with disabilities and families to get to and from Southland station. The Council Officer's recommendation was that this petition be dealt with in conjunction with a report to be presented at the August 18th 2020 Ordinary Council Meeting regarding the Pennydale Structure Plan. On August 18, 2020 at the Bayside Council Ordinary Meeting, the Council officers presented their report explaining all of the options put to them by DELWP showing pros and cons of all 3 options and then recommended that the Pennydale Structure Plan be abandoned and to write to the residents of Pennydale to advise them of the decision. Further, it was determined that the officers prepare a report into the feasibility of the items bought up in the Petition tabled at the July 28th 2020 Ordinary Council Meeting to be tabled at the December 15th 2020 Ordinary Council Meeting, and, to investigate the feasibility of implementation of a number of aspects of the now abandoned Pennydale Structure Plan that can still be achieved directly via implementation from Council, also to be presented at the December 5th 2020 Ordinary Council meeting. The vote by all Councillors was unanimous. Education Olympic Avenue Kindergarten is located in Olympic Avenue Pennydale, adjacent to Pennydale Park. Transport Pennydale lies between Southland railway station and Cheltenham railway station on the Frankston railway line. On 26 November 2017, Southland railway station opened just south of Bay Road, immediately adjacent to the Westfield Southland Shopping Centre car park. As part of the construction of the station, an entrance was provided that can open to Tulip Grove. However, when surveyed by Public Transport Victoria (PTV), 89% of residents said they did not want that entrance opened. At a subsequent meeting held between a number of residents, Murray Thompson, the then member for Sandringham, PTV, and the Public Transport Minister, it was agreed that the entrance should remain closed unless the number of passengers warranted opening it. Bayside Council confirmed that it did not want that station entrance to open. In 2015 as part of the Level Crossings Removal Project (LXRP) it was announced that the Level Crossings at Cheltenham and Mentone were to be removed. Residents began the involvement with the project to attempt to ensure that these were not replaced with Skyrail bridges but lowered into a trench. In June 2016 preliminary reports for other stations along the Frankston line showed that some stations would be put onto a Skyrail bridge and as such the residents doubled don to try to make Cheltenham go into a trench. Many residents took part in online and on location consultations and on 1 February 2017 the LXRP announced that Cheltenham Station would be lowered into a trench and that both Park Road and Charman Road Level Crossings would be removed. In February 2019 the initial works began to prepare for the removal of the level crossings and the construction of the new Cheltenham Railway Station in a trench. On 15 May 2019 the LXRP released a document stating \\"As part of the removal of three level crossings in Cheltenham and Mentone, the Level Crossing Removal Project will protect and preserve the existing heritage station buildings. Mentone Station and gardens are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The Cheltenham Station buildings have local heritage protection. We have engaged independent experts who specialise in heritage assessments to help us as we have developed the designs for removing the level crossings at Park Road and Charman Road in Cheltenham and Balcombe Road in Mentone. We will carefully relocate the timber station buildings at Mentone and Cheltenham away from the work sites and refurbish them. The Mentone Station buildings will be returned to their existing locations, with a new ‚Äòheritage bridge‚Äô across the rail line between the buildings. The final location of the Cheltenham Station buildings is yet to be determined, and we will work with the local community during this process.\\". Major works commenced on the Level Crossing Removal in September 2019 with the ne level crossings removed and free flow of traffic available on both Park Road and Charman Road in June 2020. The new Cheltenham Station is due to open on Monday 17 August 2020. Pennydale is also served by a number of bus routes including Route 828 (Hampton to Berwick Station via Southland Shopping Centre and Dandenong) along Bay Road, and Route 822 (Chadstone Shopping Centre to Sandringham via Murrumbeena and Southland Shopping Centre) along Jack Road and Park Road.

The Commissioner- General of Prisons reports to the Subject Minister, who is in turn responsible to the Parliament of Sri Lanka. The current Commissioner-General of Prisons is Thushara Upuldeniya. History The new prisons system that evolved in Britain was introduced to the British colonies during 1844. The Department of Prisons came into existence first affiliated to the Police Dept. under the then Inspector General of Police Sir George William Robert Campbell under the Act no.18 of 1844. The supervision and control of all prisons in the Island were vested in Inspector General of Prisons. From its inceptions the office of Inspector General of Prisons was held by the Inspector General of Police until 1905 when they separated. Major Albert De Wilton who till then held both offices was appointed Inspector General of Prisons and he was also appointed to be the Superintendent of the Prisons at Welikada, Mutwal and Hultsdorf. In 1922 the penal colony of the Andaman Islands were closed down and 62 life convicts sent back to Ceylon. In 1944 a probation system was introduced as a branch of the Prison Department. Responsibilities The Department of Prisons is tasked with ensuring that custodial sentences (imprisonment) and non-custodial sentences and orders (home detention, supervision, community work and release on conditions) imposed by Sri Lankan Courts are administered in a safe, secure, humane and effective way. The Department aims to contribute to the maintenance of a safe and just society by reducing the level of re- offending through the delivery of targeted and appropriate programmes to help offender's rehabilitation and reintegration to society. The Department is also responsible for the transportation of prisoners within the country with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Police.

The orchestra was founded in 1948 by H. Arthur Brown who was principal conductor from 1948 till 1958.

Many of the symphony's musicians also played in the pit orchestra for the Tulsa Little Theatre. After its premier concert at the Akdar Theater as the Tulsa Civic Symphony in January 1927, the small orchestra was directed by Berger until 1933, when illness forced him to retire.

History The \\"onion\\" pattern was originally named the \\"bulb\\" pattern.Kovels: Onion Pattern While modelled after a pattern first produced by Chinese porcelain painters, which featured pomegranates unfamiliar in Saxony, the plates and bowls produced in the Meissen factory in 1740 produced their own style and feel. Among the earliest Chinese examples are underglaze blue and white porcelains of the early Ming Dynasty. The Meissen painters created hybrids that resembled flora more familiar to Europeans. The so-called \\"onions\\" are not onions at all, but, according to historians, are most likely mutations of the peaches and pomegranates modelled on the original Chinese pattern. The design is a grouping of several floral motifs, with peonies and asters in the pattern's centre, and winding stems around a bamboo stalk. Before the end of the 18th century, other porcelain factories were copying the Meissen Zwiebelmuster. In the 19th century almost all the European manufactories offered a version, with transfer-printed outlines that were coloured in by hand. Enoch Wedgwood's pattern in the 1870s was known as \\"Meissen\\". Today, a Japanese version called \\"Blue Danube\\" is well-known and featured amongst tableware patterns.\\"Blue Danube\\" is number 7 in \\"Appendix A: 100 Most Popular Patterns\\" listed from the records of Replacements.com and illustrated in Shax Riegler. 2011. Dish: 813 Colorful, Wonderful Dinner Plates pp256ff.  Characteristics  While the design is considered to have originated from an east Asian model, likely Chinese, it also demonstrates the European influence within the abstract stylisation. It is connected with the rhythm and rules of rococo ornamentation: for instance, the asymmetrical motif is composed according to type in various areas, giving the impression of symmetry.A Brief History of Zwiebelmuster Onion Pattern Porcelain The onion pattern was designed as a white ware decorated with cobalt blue underglaze pattern. Some rare dishes have a green, red, pink, or black pattern instead of the cobalt blue. A very rare type is called red bud because there are red accents on the blue-and- white dishes.

This may represent a normal developmental process, contributing to sexual differentiation. Feminization can also be induced by environmental factors, and this phenomenon has been observed in several animal species. In the case of transgender hormone therapy, it is intentionally induced artificially. Pathological feminization In animals, when feminization occurs in a male, or at an inappropriate developmental age, it is often due to a genetic or acquired disorder of the endocrine system. In humans, one of the more common manifestations of abnormal feminization is gynecomastia, the inappropriate development of breasts which may result from elevated levels of feminizing hormones such as estrogens. Deficiency or blockage of virilizing hormones (androgens) can also contribute to feminization. In some cases, high levels of androgens may produce both virilizing effects (increased body hair, deepened voice, increased muscle mass, etc.) and feminizing effects (gynecomastia) since androgens can be converted to estrogens by aromatase in the peripheral tissues. In insects, feminization can occur through inheritance of reproduction-manipulating endosymbionts. This promotes the inheritance of the endosymbionts because the endosymbionts are passed on by mothers to their eggs. As such, the more endosymbiont-infected females there are in a population, the more the endosymbionts are passed on to the next generation.

Due to its central location, Okinawa was influenced by various cultures with a long history of trade and cultural exchange, including Japan, China and Southeast Asia, that greatly influenced the development of martial arts on Okinawa.

Produced by Angry Sky Entertainment, the program follows storm chasers Reed Timmer and Joel Taylor through Tornado Alley during the 2003 storm season. The film was produced and directed by Ken Cole. Overview As opposed to many documentaries focusing strictly on the science and destructive nature of tornadoes, Tornado Glory examines the determination, excitement, and struggles of storm chasing from the personal experiences of two University of Oklahoma meteorology students, Reed Timmer and Joel Taylor. Timmer in particular has emerged as a controversial figure in the storm chasing world, favoring high-risk chase tactics such as speeding and driving in reverse to get out of a tornado's path. Taylor and Timmer's critics, including notable meteorology professors, take issue with such tactics, as well as Timmer's high-profile television appearances. The documentary blends the personal stories and backgrounds of the two main chasers with chase sequences from their 2003 chase season. Events covered in the movie include October 9, 2001, in Elk City, Oklahoma, April 5, 2003, in Stonewall County, Texas, the May 15, 2003, outbreak and June 24, 2003, in Manchester, South Dakota, in which Timmer was almost hit by a mile-wide tornado. According to the DVD commentaries, Taylor, Timmer, and Cole studied meteorology together at the University of Oklahoma, graduating in 2002. Taylor graduated with a bachelor's degree, while Timmer is currently pursuing a doctorate in meteorology. Cole, who was also cinematographer and editor, graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. in meteorology in 2002. He then studied filmmaking as part of his master's degree.

As a classic example, the lexicographic order of totally ordered sets is a linear extension of their product order. Definitions Given any partial orders ‚â§ and ‚â§* on a set X, ‚â§* is a linear extension of ‚â§ exactly when (1) ‚â§* is a total order and (2) for every x and y in X, if , then . It is that second property that leads mathematicians to describe ‚â§* as extending ‚â§. Alternatively, a linear extension may be viewed as an order-preserving bijection from a partially ordered set P to a chain C on the same ground set.  Order-extension principle  The statement that every partial order can be extended to a total order is known as the order-extension principle. A proof using the axiom of choice was first published by Edward Marczewski in 1930. Marczewski writes that the theorem had previously been proven by Stefan Banach, Kazimierz Kuratowski, and Alfred Tarski, again using the axiom of choice, but that the proofs had not been published.. In modern axiomatic set theory the order-extension principle is itself taken as an axiom, of comparable ontological status to the axiom of choice. The order-extension principle is implied by the Boolean prime ideal theorem or the equivalent compactness theorem,. but the reverse implication doesn't hold.. Applying the order-extension principle to a partial order in which every two elements are incomparable shows that (under this principle) every set can be linearly ordered. This assertion that every set can be linearly ordered is known as the ordering principle, OP, and is a weakening of the well-ordering theorem. However, there are models of set theory in which the ordering principle holds while the order-extension principle does not.. Related results The order extension principle is constructively provable for finite sets using topological sorting algorithms, where the partial order is represented by a directed acyclic graph with the set's elements as its vertices. Several algorithms can find an extension in linear time.. Despite the ease of finding a single linear extension, the problem of counting all linear extensions of a finite partial order is #P-complete; however, it may be estimated by a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme. . Among all partial orders with a fixed number of elements and a fixed number of comparable pairs, the partial orders that have the largest number of linear extensions are semiorders.. The order dimension of a partial order is the minimum cardinality of a set of linear extensions whose intersection is the given partial order; equivalently, it is the minimum number of linear extensions needed to ensure that each critical pair of the partial order is reversed in at least one of the extensions. Antimatroids may be viewed as generalizing partial orders; in this view, the structures corresponding to the linear extensions of a partial order are the basic words of the antimatroid.. See especially item (1) on This area also includes one of order theory's most famous open problems, the 1/3‚Äì2/3 conjecture, which states that in any finite partially ordered set P that is not totally ordered there exists a pair (x,y) of elements of P for which the linear extensions of P in which number between 1/3 and 2/3 of the total number of linear extensions of P... An equivalent way of stating the conjecture is that, if one chooses a linear extension of P uniformly at random, there is a pair (x,y) which has probability between 1/3 and 2/3 of being ordered as . However, for certain infinite partially ordered sets, with a canonical probability defined on its linear extensions as a limit of the probabilities for finite partial orders that cover the infinite partial order, the 1/3‚Äì2/3 conjecture does not hold..  Algebraic combinatorics  Counting the number of linear extensions of a finite poset is a common problem in algebraic combinatorics.

Willow Springs is a sandy bottom spring and well fed lake, similar to Maywood Beach in Mississippi. The water was chemically treated, chlorinated, pH balanced, and clear. Unlike most water parks, visitors could bring their own food and drinks into the park, though a restaurant called Upper Deck Caf√© was located on site.

The Arkansas Department of Health determined that the park may have been at higher risk because the water is shallow and heats up faster (as the causative parasite is somewhat thermophillic). The owner had hoped to re-open the park if it would have been financially feasible to cover the bottom with concrete, since the protist that causes the disease tends to live in the soil at the bottom of lakes.

His royal title, Okhna or Lord in English, was bestowed upon him by the King of Cambodia due to his extensive works in helping to preserve Khmer literature, his writings and his poetry skills. Biography He was born to Mr. Bongchong Keo in Rokar Korng Village, Tonle Thom, Muk Kampoul, Kandal Province, on July 22, 1859. He studied Khmer literature when he was 10. When he was 15, he translated 'Prash Bakriyath', and then became a monk at Wat Pri Po for one year. He then went to study with Lok Archa Peach in Prash Tropang. When he was 18, he studied with Buddhist Professor Brak at Wat Una Lom in Phnom Penh. When he was 19, he studied with Lok Archa Sok at Wat Keo, Battambang. He became a monk again when he was 20 at Wat Keo for one year, and studied in Bangkok. After 7 years in Thailand, he came back to Cambodia during the time of Lok Prash Yakatha Choun Gnogn and stayed at Wat Kandal, Battambang for 10 years. He then married Lok Yay Tuet from Chomka Somroung village, Battambang and lived in Chvia Thom village. Lok Prash Yakatha Choun Gnogn gave him the title of Khon Vichit Voha and then as Hlung Vichit Voha. He wrote and translated Pali texts into Khmer for 44 different titles. After Lok Prash Yakatha Choun Gnogn left Battambang, he went to work in Phnom Penh for 10 years (1914-1924). When he was 55, he was promoted to be Lok Oknha Suttantaprija. He helped create the Khmer Buddhist Dictionary at the Pali school. Between the age of 55 and 65, he came back and spent the rest of his life with his family in Battambang. He died on November 8, 1924. Works His work includes the Katilok series, Nirasnatavat, Hombang back, Bakthom Sompoth, Loknitbakor, Sopearseth Chbap Srey, and many poems. Some of his works, such as Katilok and Chombang Takoa, were written to reflect the Khmer culture and life during Lok Prash Yakatha Choun Gnogn's time. At the turn of the century, Lok Oknha Suttantaprija Ind was prominent in Battambang Province. Everybody called him Lok Archa Ind, admired his work, and respected him for his contributions to the society. Before there were books published in Battambang, people borrowed his books and hand copied. They circulated the hand copied books from one to another to read and study. Some people memorized his poems for the whole books by heart. He also worked with a French Catholic missionary, Tong Da, and created a French ‚Äì Khmer dictionary which is known as \\"Dictionary Tong Da\\". According to Ind Lone, his daughter, there were a lot of books collected by French government right after he died. So, there might be other work that was never published and taken away by French. She also said, he was invited by people to talk about dharma and tell stories when there was a ceremony or events such as a wedding, open house, etc. He would come back home with a lot of money and he would always like to give his money away to his grandchildren. He would lay flat on his stomach writing all night long. Family He had 5 children: Ind Son (son- deceased), Ind San (daughter - deceased), Ind Ly (daughter - deceased), Ind Lone (daughter - deceased, and Ind Yueon (daughter - deceased). Currently (2015) there is only one grandchild - Ind Yueon's daughter, who still lives in Chvia Village, Sangke District, Battambang.

One bootlegged performance, which was recorded from Cynthia Gooding's radio show called Folksinger's Choice sometime in early 1962, starts with Dylan saying that the melody is based on chords he heard from folk musician Len Chandler.Oliver Trager, Keys to the rain (Billboard Books), 132. The melody is quite similar to \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\" from the album Bob Dylan. Dylan's performance of the song was released on the 1972 album Broadside Ballads, Vol. 6: Broadside Reunion, under the artist name Blind Boy Grunt. Another recording, taped as a demo for music publisher M. Witmark & Sons and also bootlegged for many years, was released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 9 ‚Äì The Witmark Demos: 1962‚Äì1964 in October 2010. Reception According to Glenn C. Altschuler, when in 1962 the song \\"was played on WGES radio, the telephone company in Chicago reported 8,394 busy signals, virtually all of them listeners trying to contact the station.\\"Glenn C. Altschuler, All Shook Up: How Rock 'n' Roll Changed America (Oxford University Press US, 2003), 56‚Äì57. Stephen J. Whitfield calls the lyrics \\"mawkish\\" but describes \\"the ballad\\" as \\"a precocious attempt to continue the tradition of the folk protest song.\\"Stephen J. Whitfield, A Death in the Delta: The Story of Emmett Till (JHU Press, 1991), 99.

WHAJ is owned and operated by First Media Services. History WHAJ began as WHIS-FM in 1948, as the strongest FM station in the world at the time, with an effective radiated power of 186,000 watts. It was the sister station of WHIS. The radio station was not successful, and broadcasting had permanently ceased by 1950. The management of WHIS decided to relaunch the station in 1963, this time with an Effective Radiated Power of 5.8 kW. In 1977 power was increased to 100 kW and the call sign was changed from WHIS-FM to WHAJ-FM to emphasize separate programming from WHIS. When the radio station was relaunched in 1963, the studios were co-located with WHIS and WHIS-TV (now WVVA) in what was then the Bluefield, WV City Hall. In December 1967, the three stations moved to a new, state-of-the-art facility on East Cumberland Road. The facility was known as Broadcast Center. WHIS-TV was sold to Quincy Newspapers in 1980, and remained in Broadcast Center. WHIS and WHAJ-FM moved to 900 Bluefield Avenue, where they remain today. Technical Automation From the 1970s until 1987, WHAJ used a Shaffer 903 automation system. From 1987 to 1990, WHAJ did not employ radio automation. On March 6, 1990, WHAJ became the world's first radio station to use Computer Concepts' Digital Commercial System (DCS) automation, considered the first commercially successful digital radio automation systems. In 1996, the DCS system was replaced by a first-generation system from Scott Studios. The older Scott Studios system was upgraded to Scott Studios SS32 in 2003. Transmitter sites WHAJ's transmitter is located on East River Mountain, overlooking the city of Bluefield. When the station returned to the air in 1963, the transmitter was co-located with WVVA-TV (then WHIS-TV). The antenna was side- mounted on the TV tower. The transmitter was an RCA BTF-5D. WVVA's transmitter site is unique because the TV transmitter building is in the state of Virginia, but the TV tower and antenna are in West Virginia. This was a problem in 1977 when the management of the station wished to begin operations at 100 kW. In accordance with FCC rules FM radio stations in West Virginia may not have an Effective Radiated Power greater than 50 kW. This problem was solved by constructing a new tower 80 feet to the east-southeast of the TV tower. This tower was in Virginia, enabling 100 kW operation. A Harris FM-20K transmitter and ERI 12 Bay antenna was installed and 100 kW operation began in 1977. In the late 1990s it became desirable to relocate the station's transmitter to a new location for two reasons. Firstly, the TV station had been sold, and the FM station was paying rent to the TV station for use of the transmitter site. Secondly, the site was undesirable from a technical perspective. The 1977 tower was too short and the rocky terrain would make a new, tall tower impractical. A new tower was therefore constructed approximately 1 mile to the west-southwest of the TV tower. WHAJ-FM moved to this site in 2000, using a Broadcast Electronics 25K transmitter. Co-owned WKOY and WHKX also moved to this site. (The old WHAJ-FM tower at the WVVA site is now used from WVVA-DT.) Programming In the 1960s and 1970s, WHAJ had a Beautiful Music format and the station's on-air moniker was \\"Stereo 104\\". In August 1981, WHIS-AM's Contemporary Hit Radio format was moved to WHAJ, and J104 was born. J104 was an instant success both in terms of ratings and advertiser acceptance. For most of the 1980s, J104 was the most listened-to radio station in West Virginia. Today, J104 continues to be one of West Virginia's most successful radio stations, winning the West Virginia Broadcasters Association \\"Station of the Year\\" Award in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2017.

He was the namesake of the Conradiner family and son of Udo of Neustria. His mother (probably) was a daughter of Conrad I of Logenahe (832‚Äì860). He was the count of the Oberlahngau (886), Hessengau (897), Gotzfeldgau (903), Wetterau (905), and Wormsgau (906). He united all of Hesse under his political control and under his heirs this territory became the Duchy of Franconia. Early in his career, Conrad feuded with the Babenbergs Henry of Franconia and Adalbert. Conrad's chief residence was Friedeslar in Hesse. He was a comes (count) and ministerialis of Arnulf of Germany in 891. In 892, Duke Poppo was deposed from his offices and replaced in Thuringia and the Sorbian March by Conrad. He only held the dukedom briefly before he was replaced by Burchard. The reason for his appointment probably represent a change in Arnulf's policy in favour of the Conradines over the Babenbergs; but Conrad's short tenure may reflect his lack of support in Thuringia or an unwillingness on his part to be confined there.Reuter, Germany, 123. Around 880, Conrad married Glismod (also spelled Glismuot or Glismut). She may have been a daughter of Arnulf of Carinthia, or else a relative of the earlier Thuringian dukes (perhaps a daughter of Thachulf), thus giving her husband a hereditary claim to Thuringia. They had four children: Conrad the Younger, the future king of Germany; Eberhard, future duke of Franconia; Otto (also Udo or Odo), future count in the Ruhrgau and the middle Lahn, who died in 918; and a daughter, name unknown. In 906, as a result of a feud with the Babenbergs, Conrad was killed in battle near Fritzlar and was buried in the church of Saint Martin at Weilburg. His eldest son was also old enough to participate in this war. His widow, Glismod, died in 26 April 924 and was buried next to him. Sources *Reuter, Timothy.

The book describes the author's personal spiritual development, use of drugs and cultivating of Eastern spiritual practices. After going on a spiritual journey, Collier returned home to write the book in 1976, and sold it at the age of nineteen. The book was published by William Morrow & Co..  Synopsis  In the book, Collier describes her experiences with recreational drug use, including marijuana and LSD, and then her introduction to Eastern spirituality through life on an ashram. At age sixteen, Collier had become friends with Abbie Hoffman, then moved to live first on a commune and later a Divine Light Mission ashram. The book describes her initiation to the Techniques of Knowledge of Guru Maharaj ji (also known as Prem Rawat) and her experiences in the organization. Years later, in an interview published in 2001 in Fast Company magazine, Collier stated that \\"At the ashram, we did things like staying up all night and meditating, things that taught us how to focus our minds\\". Skills that she still applies in stressful business situations, and that \\"drawing on those experiences has definitely helped me maintain perspective.\\"  Reception  Fast Company magazine characterized the work as a \\"precocious autobiography.\\" In the article, Ron Lieber wrote that the work \\"..reads like a diary of the brainy, excruciatingly self-aware girl that she was.\\" Lieber went on to note that though an experience in an ashram might not always be as applicable as an MBA, the spiritual experiences described by Collier in her autobiography helped her notice industry gaps and utilize a competitive advantage.

He was formerly senior pastor of First United Methodist Church, the oldest church in the Seattle area. Education Brown was born in Lancaster, California, in 1957 and moved to Seattle with his family in 1965. A graduate of Evergreen High School in 1975, Brown went on to receive his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Washington in 1978, his M.Div. from Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary in 1982 and his doctorate from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1997. Pastoral service He was ordained a United Methodist deacon in 1979 and became an elder in the church in 1984. He served the Fall City United Methodist Church in Fall City, Washington, from 1982 to 1986, the Lake Washington United Methodist Church in Kirkland, Washington, from 1986 to 1992, and was senior pastor of the First United Methodist Church of Wenatchee, Washington, from 1992 until 2001. He served as senior pastor of First United Methodist Church aka First Church of Seattle Washing from 2008 to 2014. Public office, contested election Brown was elected to the Board of Directors of the Lake Washington School District in 1989 in one of his first acts of public service beyond the local church. He served as president of the board from 1991-1992 during its AIDS education controversy. He ran unsuccessfully for school board in the Wenatchee School District in 1997. Brown gained local notoriety for his challenge, along with Rev. Kel Groseclose, of the 1999 election of the Wenatchee mayor. Brown and Groseclose contended in Chelan County Superior Court that Mayor Gary Schoessler was not a resident of Wenatchee for the requisite one year prior to his election. The court agreed, the verdict was upheld on appeal to the Washington Supreme Court on April 20, 2000, and Schoessler was removed from office. Break from pastoral work In 2001 Brown left the pastorate to serve as executive director of Deaconess Children's Services, a United Methodist mission agency, in Everett. In 2003 he was elected as executive director of the Church Council of Greater Seattle, one of the largest regional ecumenical bodies in the U.S. At the Church Council, Brown's work has focused on ending homelessness. He advocated for acceptance of Tent City 4, helping the homeless encampment with legal challenges in several suburban Seattle communities, leading to a successful challenge in the Washington State Supreme Court against the City of Woodinville on behalf of the Northshore United Church of Christ and he has been leader of the legislative advocacy arm of the Committee to End Homelessness in King County. Brown has authored numerous op-ed pieces in support of ending homelessness as well as other topics, such as bringing an end to conflict in the Middle East and (with his former wife) has advocated for high ethical standards in the practice of medicine. He has also written on the subject of living wages and the need for additional human service funding as leader of the successful 2005 Veterans and Human Services levy. While at the council, Brown led in the establishment of the Service of Hope, an interfaith program that brings a service of prayer to sites of homicides. Services of Hope were held at sites of the Capitol Hill massacre and the Jewish Federation shooting. Brown was criticized by Ken Schramm of KOMO-TV for considering a prayer service for the killer of a police officer simultaneously with the service for the officer himself In 2005 Brown received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary. In 2007, former Bishop Edward Paup announced his intention to appoint Brown to serve as senior pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Seattle beginning in July 2008. Senior pastor, First United Methodist Church of Seattle From 2008 to 2014, Brown was senior pastor of First United Methodist Church of Seattle, Seattle's first church and oldest ongoing organization. Brown oversaw the construction and successful move of First United Methodist Church from 5th and Marion, where First United Methodist Church congregation had worshiped since 1908, to a new $18 million building in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle on 2nd and Denny. He helped the church secure $1 million in funds from King County and the City of Seattle for the Blaine Center Men's Shelter, connected to the new Belltown location of the church. During his time as senior pastor, Brown led the religious community‚Äôs support of Referendum 74, the successful referendum for marriage equality in Washington, and condemned United Methodist policy on same sex marriage. After leading public marches promoting gun safety following the Sandy Hook Massacre he helped organize the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility and the successful Initiative Measure No. 594, promoting background checks for firearm sales and transfers in Washington State. During his vacation time, Brown traveled to Spain and walked the Camino de Santiago. Travel books and the Caminoist In 2015, Cicerone Press published his travel book, The Way of St Francis: From Florence to Assisi and Rome, and Brown became a travel speaker for Rick Steves. In February 2017, Brown was appointed permanent lead pastor at Edmonds United Methodist Church in Edmonds, Washington, after serving as the interim pastor for seven months. In June 2019, Brown left his ministry as lead pastor at Edmonds United Methodist Church to become a full-time travel writer and tour guide. He plans on releasing a second guidebook in January 2020 on the Camino de Santiago. Additionally, he plans to lead travel groups on the Camino de Santiago as well as caminos following the paths of Saint Francis between Assisi and Florence and between Assisi and Rome in 2020.

A Welding Procedure Specification (WPS) is the formal written document describing welding procedures, which provides direction to the welder or welding operators for making sound and quality production welds as per the code requirements . The purpose of the document is to guide welders to the accepted procedures so that repeatable and trusted welding techniques are used. A WPS is developed for each material alloy and for each welding type used. Specific codes and/or engineering societies are often the driving force behind the development of a company's WPS. A WPS is supported by a Procedure Qualification Record (PQR or WPQR). A PQR is a record of a test weld performed and tested (more rigorously) to ensure that the procedure will produce a good weld. Individual welders are certified with a qualification test documented in a Welder Qualification Test Record (WQTR) that shows they have the understanding and demonstrated ability to work within the specified WPS. Introduction The following are definitions for WPS and PQR found in various codes and standards: According to the American Welding Society (AWS), a WPS provides in detail the required welding variables for specific application to assure repeatability by properly trained welders. The AWS defines welding PQR as a record of welding variables used to produce an acceptable test weldment and the results of tests conducted on the weldment to qualify a Welding Procedure Specification. For steel construction (civil engineering structures) AWS D1.1 is a widely used standard. It specifies either a pre-qualification option (chapter 3) or a qualification option (chapter 4) for approval of welding processes.AWS D1.1/D1.1M: \\"Structural welding code - Steel\\" The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) similarly defines a WPS as a written document that provides direction to the welder or welding operator for making production welds in accordance with Code requirements.ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code section IX: \\"Qualification Standard for welding and brazing procedures, welders, brazers and welding and brazing operators\\", Article II, Section QW-200. ASME also defines welding PQR as a record of variables recorded during the welding of the test coupon. The record also contains the test results of the tested specimens. The Canadian Welding Bureau, through CSA Standards W47.1,CSA Standard W47.1: Certification of companies for the fusion welding of steel (2009) W47.2CSA Standard W47.2: Certification of companies for the fusion welding of aluminum (2011) and W186,CSA Standard W186: Welding of Reinforcing Bars in Reinforced Concrete Construction (1990) specifies both a WPS and a Welding Procedure Data Sheet (WPDS) to provide direction to the welding supervisor, welders and welding operators. The WPS provides general information on the welding process and material grouping being welded, while the WPDS provides specific welding variables/parameter/conditions for the specific weldment. All WPS and WPDS must be independently reviewed and accepted by the Canadian Welding Bureau prior to use. These CSA standards also define requirements for procedure qualification testing (PQT) to support the acceptance of the WPDS. A record of the procedure qualification test and the results must be documented on a procedure qualification record (PQR). All PQTs are independently witnessed by the Canadian Welding Bureau. In Europe, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has adopted the ISO standards on welding procedure qualification (ISO 15607 to ISO 15614), which replaced the former European standard EN 288. EN ISO 15607 defines a WPS as \\"A document that has been qualified by one of the methods described in clause 6 and provides the required variables of the welding procedure to ensure repeatability during production welding\\". The same standard defines a Welding Procedure Qualification Record (WPQR) as \\"Record comprising all necessary data needed for qualification of a preliminary welding procedure specification\\".EN ISO 15607:2005 \\"Specification and qualification of welding procedures for metallic materials - General rules (ISO 15607:2003)\\" In addition to the standard WPS qualification procedure specified in ISO 15614, the ISO 156xx series of standards provides also for alternative WPS approval methods. These include: Tested welding consumables (ISO 15610), Previous welding experience (ISO 15611), Standard welding procedure (ISO 15612) and Preproduction welding test (ISO 15613). In the oil and gas pipeline sector, the American Petroleum Institute API 1104 standard is used almost exclusively worldwide. API 1104 accepts the definitions of the American Welding Society code AWS A3.0.API 1104: \\"Welding of pipelines and related facilities\\", parts 3 (Definition of Terms) WPS is of two types- Prequalified WPS(pWPS) & qualified WPS.

The term is borrowed from a cargo shipping procedure, where a ship manifest would list the crew and/or cargo of a vessel. Package manifest Linux distributions rely heavily on package management systems for distributing software. In this scheme, a package is an archive file containing a manifest file. The primary purpose is to enumerate the files which are included in the distribution, either for processing by various packaging tools or for human consumption. Manifests may contain additional information; for example, in JAR (a package format for delivering software written in Java programming language), they can specify a version number and an entry point for execution. The manifest may optionally contain a cryptographic hash or checksum of each file. By creating a cryptographic signature for such a manifest file, the entire contents of the distribution package can be validated for authenticity and integrity, as altering any of the files will invalidate the checksums in the manifest file. Application and assembly manifest In Microsoft Windows, software that relies on Windows Side-by-Side (WinSxS) needs an application manifest, which is an XML document that is either embedded in an executable file or contained in a separate XML file that accompanies it. It bears name, version, trust information, privileges required for execution and dependencies on other components. An assembly manifest is very similar to an application manifest but describes the identity of components known as \\"assemblies\\". These assemblies are referred to in the application manifest. An example of an application manifest is as follows. This application manifest has two core parts: Security and dependency.

His episcopate coincided mostly with the emperorship of Charles the Fat and after 885 he is a leading ecclesiastical figure at the imperial court. Geilo increased the landholdings and comital rights of the diocese of Langres immensely in his short tenure, a sign of political sagacity. Geilo has been painted as a villain, an ambitious prelate trying to extend his see's temporal authority as far as it could go under the reign of weak Carolingians.MacLean, 110. Geilo was the son and namesake of Count Geilo. He was the abbot of Flavigny from 866 until 870,Bouchard, 146. and of Tournus during the last years of the reign of Charles the Bald. In 879, he crowned Boso of Provence in Mantaille; Boso in turn made him Bishop of Langres. He quickly changed sides and supported Carloman II in 880, being confirmed in his diocese, and even staying with the king at the siege of Vienne throughout the year. When Carloman died in 884, Geilo was instrumental in bringing Charles the Fat to the throne in West Francia. It is likely that he in fact crowned Charles rex in Gallia on 20 May 885 at Grand in his diocese.MacLean, 127. Geilo even developed a special West Frankish seal for Charles and met him at the Siege of Paris in 885. On 15 January 887, at the royal palace of S√©lestat in Alsace, Geilo received four imperial charters. He was commended for building up his city's walls and rewarded with all the ex officio lands of a count in the city of Langres and its environs. He was also granted the fiscal rights of a count, including that of minting, and the revenues from the markets of Langres and Dijon.MacLean, 113. The policy of episcopal empowerment in the cities of Burgundy during the 880s was largely a result of increased Viking activity in that area. On 18 May 887, Geilo attended a provincial church synod at Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne whereat the peace of the church was discussed, probably in light of the decline of Charles' health and the rising tide of opposition from Arnulf of Carinthia's quarters.MacLean, 111. Geilo was subsequently present at the assemblies of Weiblingen, whereat Charles' son Bernard was supposed to be declared heir, and of Kirchen, whereat Louis of Provence was adopted as Charles' son. It is possible that Geilo had escorted Louis and his mother, Ermengard, to Kirchen. The events of S√©lestat and Kirchen probably realised a long-sought goal of Charles': to negate the usurpation of Boso. By granting lands probably once held by Boso to Geilo and thus securing Geilo as Boso's de facto successor in northern Provence as well as adopting Louis and thus bringing Boso's heir back into the Carolingian family, Charles succeeded in reestablishing full imperial sovereignty in Provence.MacLean, 114-115. On Charles' death, he supported Guy III of Spoleto for the West Frankish throne, even crowning him at Langres in 888, but Guy's attempt failed and Geilo died later that year.MacLean, 110.

The stories in the book explored various aspects of the counterculture of the 1960s. The most famous story in the collection, from which the book takes its name, is about Jack Macpherson and his gang of surfers that frequented a sewage pump house at Windansea Beach in La Jolla, California. Publication The Pump House Gang was published on the same day in 1968 as The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Wolfe's story about the LSD-fueled adventures of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. They were Wolfe's first books since The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby in 1965 which, like The Pump House Gang, was a collection of Wolfe's non-fiction essays. Though both books were well received and would go on to become best-sellers, of the two The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test was heralded as an instant classic and would become the better-known of the two books. Writing All but two of the stories in the book were written in 1965 and 1966, during the ten months after the publication of The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby. During this period Wolfe spent extensive time with many of his subjects, including Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy Magazine (whom Wolfe famously compared to The Great Gatsby); Carol Doda, a stripper who helped popularize breast- implants; and the surfers of the pump house.Wolfe, Tom. \\"The Pump House Gang,\\" Introduction Other subjects Wolfe profiles in the book include actress Natalie Wood, the New York Hilton, then-Mod Joan Juliet Buck, the visionary media- theorist Marshall McLuhan and various socialites of New York. The essays collectively tell the story of the new status symbols and lifestyles of the 1960s and how the culture was changing from the traditional social hierarchies of the time. The success of the book cemented Wolfe as one of his generation's most prominent social critics. Style The stories in The Pump House Gang are written in the style of New Journalism that Wolfe and other writers like Joan Didion and Gay Talese helped to popularize. According to Time Magazine's review of Wolfe's book: > He uses a language that explodes with comic-book words like \\"POW!\\" and > \\"boing.\\" His sentences are shot with ellipses, stabbed with exclamation > points, or bombarded with long lists of brand names and anatomical terms. He > is irritating, but he did develop a new journalistic idiom that has brought > relief from standard Middle-High Journalese. Wolfe's style was simultaneously mocked and widely imitated. In 1990 the Los Angeles Times interviewed many of the surfers who had been involved with the pump house gang. Some of the surfers claimed that Wolfe took liberties with the facts to embellish and mythologize the lifestyle of the surfers. Other members of the pump house gang believe Wolfe's characterizations were correct.

The film is based on Semb√®ne's novel The Money- Order. It is the director's first film in his native Wolof language. Since most of the Senegalese population did not understand French, Semb√®ne wanted to create cinema for Wolof speakers. This is the first full-length African language film from West Africa. Plot An unemployed Senegalese Muslim, Ibrahima Dieng, lives with his two wives and seven children in Dakar. His nephew, Abdou, sends him a money order from Paris worth 250 francs, which he has saved from working as a street sweeper. Ibrahima is to keep some of the money for himself, save a portion for his nephew, and give a portion to his sister. However, Ibrahima faces numerous difficulties trying to obtain the money order. Not having an ID, Ibrahima must go through several levels of Senegalese bureaucracy to try to get one, only to fail after spending money he does not have. Meanwhile, neighbors come over asking for money and Ibrahima is further indebted. In the end, he is swindled by Mbaye, a Senegalese businessman, who promised to cash the money order for him. Mbaye sells Ibrahima's house to a French man and steals the money order, saying that he was pickpocketed. The film leaves Ibrahima in debt and without a home. The film explores themes of neocolonialism, religion, corruption, and relationships in Senegalese society.

It stored food and dishes. The madia was a service piece, meaning it was not made for looks, but made to hold objects and used for a purpose. It would usually be found in the kitchen, not in an open area. In Italy, the madia was also a kitchen piece that was used to make bread. The madia had two parts: the first was a cupboard bottom that could be used to store items. The top part could be lifted up. The dough would be placed in the top portion where it could rise, and then would be baked.

He then studied at the Dresden Academy from 1922 to 1923. During the 1920s his paintings, primarily portraits of working-class subjects, were influenced by the work of Otto Dix.Michalski 1994, p. 64 Like his friend Gert Heinrich Wollheim, he often depicted himself in a theatrical manner, as in his Self-Portrait during the Carnival Season (1930).Michalski 1994, pp. 131‚Äì133 He had his first solo exhibition in 1930 at the Dresden gallery of J√≥zef Sandel.\\"Grundig, Hans\\" (1996). Biographisches Handbuch der SBZ/DDR. Munich: Saur. vol. 1. p. 254. He made his first etchings in 1933. Politically anti-fascist, he joined the German Communist Party in 1926, and was a founding member of the arts organization Assoziation revolution√§rer bildender K√ºnstler in Dresden in 1929. Following the fall of the Weimar Republic, Grundig was declared a degenerate artist by the Nazis, who included his works in the defamatory Degenerate Art exhibition in Munich in 1937. He expressed his antagonism toward the regime in paintings such as The Thousand Year Reich (1936). Forbidden to practice his profession, he was arrested twice‚Äîbriefly in 1936, and again in 1938, after which he was interned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1944. In 1945 he went to Moscow, where he attended an anti-fascist school. Returning to Berlin in 1946, he became a professor of painting at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. In 1957 he published his autobiography, Zwischen Karneval und Aschermittwoch (\\"Between Shrovetide carnival and Ash Wednesday\\").

On June 27, 1950, as part of the project, a special unit was formed in Japan under Major Dean Hess, with the objective of training selected South Korean pilots to fly the F-51. Some of the Korean pilots were veterans of Japanese Army and Naval air forces during World War II. On July 2, the unit was transferred to Daegu Air Base, South Korea. After transfer, the unit was redesignated as 51st Provisional Fighter Squadron of the Republic of Korea Air Force, but remained under U.S. Air Force command, as the Koreans were not deemed prepared to operate their new aircraft effectively. Nevertheless, given the desperate situation on the ground, the 51st Squadron was committed to combat a day after their arrival, to support the U.S. 24th Infantry Division fighting near Daejon. The combat operations revealed a number of problems. Major Hess felt that, although enthusiastic, South Korean pilots were not ready to operate F-51's effectively. Within two weeks' operation, two fighters were lost to ground fire. Because most Korean pilots did not speak English, there were problems in coordinating air operations with U.S. Army and Air Force. At the same time, because most South Korean Army officers did not speak English, they had difficulty requesting air support from U.S. Air Force as well, underlining the need for South Korean aircraft to support South Korean army units. In late July, U.S. Air Force decided to disband the 51st Provisional Squadron and transfer its aircraft to U.S. Air Force units to be flown by American pilots. This plan was met by loud protest both from the South Korean government and Major Hess and was subsequently rescinded. However, most U.S. personnel were transferred from the 51st to U.S. units, leaving only two pilots (including Major Hess) and 13 ground crewmen. After losing two more F-51's, Major Hess decided that Korean pilots required further training. The 51st Squadron was relocated first to Sacheon Air Base, then Chinhae Air Base to continue intensive training while occasionally taking part in combat along the Naktong River, during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter. On December 6, 1950, the 51st Squadron was relocated to Daejon. By this time, the unit was actively participating in support of the United Nations forces who had been driven back south of the 38th Parallel following the intervention by the Chinese forces during the preceding winter. By this time, Bout One Project was deemed a success and the U.S. Air Force decided to train additional Republic of Korea Air Force pilots and ground crews and deliver more F-51's. On August 1, 1951, Bout One Project was officially terminated as the Republic of Korea Air Force was deemed capable of independent operation. At this time, the survivors of the 51st Provisional Squadron, as well as the additional aircraft provided by the U.S., were combined to form 10th Fighter Wing of Republic of Korea Air Force, under Colonel Kim Young Hwan, one of the original participants in the Bout One Project, at Sacheon Air Base.

For his bravery in World War II, he was awarded the Military Cross. Second World War He deployed in the Middle Eastern combat theater during WWII. He won the Military Cross for combat bravery Syria in July 1941, in the fight for the Jebel Mazar mountain close to Mount Hermon, during the fierce Syria-Lebanon campaign. Jebel Mazar (Latitude 34.61667N, Longitude 38.28333E) is a mountain dominating the Damascus-Beirut route that the enemy was using very effectively to prevent British Commonwealth (British, Australian and Indian) troops from advancing to Beirut. His actions as recorded in the medal commendation (from the British National Archives, verbatim without corrections): ::In the operations carried out by the 16th Infantry Brigade in the DAMASCUS Sector on 10th July, 1941, the 1st (Indep) \\"J\\" & \\"K\\" Mountain Battery, I.S.F., was under the Command of 2nd King's Own Royal Regiment in their attack on the JEBEL MAZAR feature. ::At an early hour on the morning of 10th July - the Commander, 2nd King's Own Royal Regiment was out of touch with his two forward Companies whom he knew to be held up in their advance on Points 1404 and 1455. He decided that a Forward Observation Officer should be sent forward to bring supporting fire to the Company on Point 1404. Lieut. MADN LAL VAID was detailed for this purpose, and although the Commander, 2nd King's Own Royal Regiment was unable to instruct him exactly where to go and find the Company himself. He took his Forward Observation Officer's party across an open valley, swept by Machine Gun fire where no movement had taken place since first light, made contact with the Company Commander, and established line communication from the Forward Observation Post to the Battery Position, thus giving the Battalion Commander communication with his forward Company. ::Immediately on his arrival at the Company position he engaged Mortars and Machine Guns which were causing casualties, and in spite of the proximity of our own troops to his targets, he carried out extremely effective shoots and destroyed one Machine Gun and one Mortar. Our troops on this feature were surrounded on three sides and were under continuous M.G. and Mortar fire, and it was very largely the quick and effective shooting by Lieut. MADAN LAL which enabled the company to retain its hold on this position in spite of heavy enemy pressure, both by reason of its damage to the enemy and its encouraging effect on the morale of our own troops.

Life Waldes Koh-i-noor fasteners for the German market, 1920s Karel Waldes, father of Jind≈ôich, had an inn and a small haberdashery shop in the village of Nemy≈°l near the town of T√°bor in southern Bohemia. He wanted his son to continue his business but Jind≈ôich found a position of a clerk at the firm of Eduard Lokesch and Son in Prague. This company made buttons and cufflinks. As Waldes had a good knowledge of languages he became Lokesch‚Äôs business agent and travelled the world on behalf of the firm. In 1902 together with an engineer Hynek Puc (1856‚Äì1938) Waldes left Lokesch and founded his own company Waldes a spol. A year later Puc invented a special machine that inserted a small spring into concealed dress fasteners, the main product of the new firm. The new machine supplemented labour of ten skilled workers. With the increased production Puc kept inventing more machines to support the manufacture of pins, safety pins, needles and buttons. The world-renowned Waldes trademark, Miss KIN, came about in 1912 when Waldes on his ocean trip met Elizabeth Coyne'Koh-i-noor Girl', Koh-i-noor Magazin, Volume IV, number 37, January 1933, page 3, as her signature under her photograph confirms. who playfully put one fastener in her eye. Franti≈°ek Kupka painted her portrait in oils and Vojtƒõch Preissig from it designed the firm‚Äôs trademark. The other trade names used were Koh-i-noor and Otello. Waldes Koh-i-noor headquarters were located in Prague suburbs of Vr≈°ovice. Soon the company grew to a large concern with branch factories in Warsaw, Dresden, Vienna, Paris, Barcelona and New York City. On 1 September 1939 Waldes was imprisoned by Gestapo after the Third Reich occupation of Czechoslovakia and kept in concentration camps Dachau and Buchenwald, arriving in Dachau on September 10, 1939 and transferred to Buchenwald on September 26 of the same year. In 1941 his family, who were sent to USA by Waldes before the war (he decided to remain in Prague as a Czech patriot) paid the Nazi authorities 8 million Czech crowns (about 1 Million Reichsmarks or $250,000 US) ransom. In Buchenwald he suffered a diabetic attack, and was in the prison hospital from 11 April 1940 until his release on 2 June 1941. The Gestapo then transported Waldes by plane to Lisbon, Portugal, where he boarded a United States-bound ship. However, Waldes did not survive the journey to the USA and died under suspicious circumstances on the ship which stopped at Havana, Cuba in May 1941. > \\"He [Waldes] arrived on a Portuguese ship in Cuba. In the moment that he > stepped onto solid ground, he broke down and died.\\"Obituary in Aufbau > Magazine, New York, July 25, 1941. Translated from the German: \\"Er kam mit > einem portugiesischen Schiff auf Cuba an. In dem Augenblick, da er den > festen Boden betrat, brach er zusammen und starb. According to witness testimony during a case in the US in the late 1950s, Waldes actually died in a hospital in Havana.Lauterbach, E: International Law Reports, Vol. 29, Cambridge University Press, 1966, Page 357. He was cremated at a memorial attended by several hundred people on 15 July 1941 at Fresh Pond, Maspeth, in New York. Waldes was also a passionate art collector of contemporary Czech art. In 1918 in Prague he founded Waldes Museum for his collection of buttons which had over 70 thousand items. The collection was transferred after the Second World War to Museum of Decorative Arts (Umƒõleckopr≈Ømyslov√© museum) in Prague. Apart from buttons he collected works of Czech painters especially Franti≈°ek Kupka‚Äôs paintings. They became friends in 1919 and remained so until 1938. Waldes supported Kupka throughout his career by buying his canvases. Part of Jind≈ôich Waldes‚Äô collection held by the National Gallery in Prague had been returned to his descendants living in the United States. In 2007 the Prague City Court rendered the decision to return fifty percent of the Czech Koh-i-Noor holdings to the Waldes family heirs. However, in 2010 the Constitutional Court in Brno reversed the decision, stating that the Bene≈° decrees of 1945 handed the property to the Czech state, not the Communist seizures in 1948.

The Talmudic account Among five catastrophes said to have overtaken the Jews on the Seventeenth of Tammuz, the MishnahTa'anit iv. 6. includes \\"the burning of the Torah by Apostomus\\". Owing to this very vague mention, there is much difference of opinion as to the identity of Apostomus. At first glance he may be associated with one of the following two incidents: * Flavius Josephus\\"Ant.\\" xx. 5, ¬ß 4; \\"B. J.\\" ii. 12, ¬ß 2. relates that about the year 50 a Roman soldier seized a Torah-scroll and, with abusive and mocking language, burned it in public. This incident almost brought on a revolution; but the Roman procurator Cumanus appeased the Jewish populace by beheading the culprit. *The other incident of the burning of the Torah, which took place at the time of the Hadrianic Persecutions, is recounted by the rabbis. ·∏§anania ben Teradyon, one of the most distinguished men of the time, was wrapped in a Torah-scroll and burned.Sifre, Deut. 307; 'Ab. Zarah 18a; Sem. viii. In connection with this, a certain \\"philosopher\\" is mentioned as the executioner of ·∏§anania. Some circumstances lend plausibility to the idea that the name is a corruption. According to the Jerusalem Talmud,Ta'anit iv. 68c et seq. Apostomus burned the Torah at the narrow pass of Lydda (or, as another report has it, at Tarlosa, which was probably not far from Lydda); and it is known that ·∏§anina was one of \\"the martyrs of Lydda.\\" Furthermore, a somewhat later authorityAddenda to Meg. Ta'anit, ed. Neubauer, in \\"Medieval Jew. Chron.\\" ii. 24. gives the date of ·∏§anina's death as the twenty-seventh of Tammuz, which is only a difference of a few days from the date assigned to the crime of Apostomus. The Mishnah referred to adds the following statement to its account of the burning of the Law: \\"And he put up an idol in the sanctuary.\\" Here it is first necessary to determine that the reading (\\"and he put up\\") is correct, and that it should not be (\\"and there was put up\\"), which the Jerusalem TalmudTa'anit iv. 68d. gives as a variant in the accepted text, interpreting the fact mentioned in the Mishnah as referring to the idols put up in the sanctuary by Manasseh.II Kings xxi. 7. But the passage in the Mishnah on the five calamities of the Ninth of Ab enumerates them in strictly chronological order; so that it is impossible that any reference to the Temple desecration by Manasseh should be registered after the burning of the Torah by Apostomus. The Babylonian Talmud knows only the reading (\\"and he put up\\") in the Mishnah, as the remark of the Gemara Ta'anit 28b. proves, where the \\"abomination of desolation,\\" of which Danielxii. 11 speaks, is connected with the image of the idol in the Temple. By this expression can only be meant the statue of Zeus Olympius set up by Antiochus Epiphanes.Compare Heinrich Gr√§tz, \\"Dauer der Hellenisirung,\\" in \\"Jahresbericht\\" of the Breslau Seminary, 1864, pp. 9, 10. Another name for Antiochus Epiphanes? The reading found in Rashi and in the Munich manuscript, has been simply drawn from the Jerusalem Talmud. But the statement in the Babylonian Talmud, that the Mishnah source concerning Apostomus is a Gemara (tradition), shows that, according to the Babylonian authorities, the date of Apostomus can not be placed later than the Maccabean period. For Gemara is a technical term employed by the Talmud to designate tannaitic sayings connected with Biblical events or laws that are neither mentioned nor alluded to in the Scriptures, in contradistinction to those derived from the Biblical text. Hence it is argued that Apostomus must belong to a time in reference to which there existed also written sources that were known to the Talmudic authorities, the latest limit being the Maccabean period; and as it has been shown that the pre-Maccabean and the Biblical epoch must be excluded, it follows that Apostomus was none other than Antiochus Epiphanes, of whom, moreover, it is known, also from other sources, that he set up an idol in the Temple. Apostomus, then, must be considered as a nickname for Antiochus Epiphanes. In fact, his name was transformed even by pagan authors into \\"Epimanes\\" = \\"the Insane\\". As told in I Macc. i. 56, Torah- scrolls were burned during the persecutions by Antiochus Epiphanes. Meaning of the name The meaning of the name \\"Apostomus\\" is not clear. Ewald (in his \\"History\\"), alluding to certain passages in the Bible and the Apocrypha,Dan. vii. 8, 20; viii. 23; and xi. 36; I Macc. i. 24. where reference is had to the boastful mouth of Antiochus Epiphanes, derives \\"Apostomus\\" from Œ±·º∞œÄœçœÇ (\\"big\\") and œÉœÑœåŒºŒ± (\\"mouth\\"). The appellation \\"big-mouth\\" is certainly appropriate, but Œ±·º∞œÄœÖœÇ is a rare word, used only in poetry. More probable perhaps is Jastrow's derivation of \\"Apostomus\\" from ·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒøŒºŒØŒ∂œâ (\\"to stop or stuff up the mouth\\") and ·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒØŒºŒøœÇ (\\"anything that stops up the mouth\\"), which may be connected with the Talmudic phrase (\\"May his mouth be stuffed full with earth!\\"), applied in the Talmud to the name of a man who had spoken boldly against the Deity.B. B. 16a. The following are other explanations of the word: *Jastrow\\"Dictionary of the Talmud\\" offers a suggestion that it may be a corruption of ·ºÄœÄœåœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøœÇ (\\"ambassador\\"), and makes it refer to the envoy spoken of in II Macc. vi. 1, 2 as having desecrated the Temple. *Hochst√§dter sees in \\"Apostomus\\" a corrupted form of ·ºÄœÄŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ (\\"apostate\\") and identifies him with the high priest Alcimus. *Schwarz and Derenbourg consider \\"Apostomus\\" the name of the Roman soldier referred to by Josephus. The name of the soldier who burned the Torah scroll was Stephanos, which, written in Hebrew, may have been corrupted. *Br√ºll connects him with Cornelius Faustus, who under Pompey was the first to climb the wall of Jerusalem. *Halberstamm is of opinion that \\"Apostomus\\" is the Hebrew transcription for the Latin \\"Faustinus,\\" and that the name, furthermore, is to be connected with Julius Severus, whose surname was Faustinus, and who perpetrated the crime described in the Mishnah when he was sent by Hadrian to put down the Bar Kokba rebellion, in which case the setting up of an idol in the sanctuary would have to be taken to refer to the dedication of a temple of Zeus upon the consecrated ground of the Temple.

He was also known as Proveau and Provot (and the pronunciation was \\"Pra-vo\\"). Leading a company headquartered in Taos, in what is today New Mexico, he was active in the Green River drainage and the central portion of modern Utah. He may have been the first man of European descent to see the Great Salt Lake, purportedly reaching its shores around 1824‚Äì25. (Others claim that Jim Bridger, an American, was the first man of European descent to see the lake.) Early life Provost was born December 21, 1785 in Chambly, Quebec, son of Albert Provost and Marie Anne Menard. He was baptized December 21, 1785 at Saint-Joseph-de-Chambly Church, Chambly County, Quebec, but little is known about his early life. He made his home in St. Louis, Missouri for 10 years marveling at the Arkansas River as late 1814 with Joseph Philibert. He left there with Auguste Chouteau and Jules deMun. He was imprisoned at Santa Fe, New Mexico twice. Santa Fe trade About 1822, he returned to New Mexico as one of the early traders. He formed a partnership with a certain Leclerc to trap in the Uinta Basin. His party was attacked by Snake Indians on October 1824 at the Jordan River near its mouth at the Great Salt Lake. Eight men were lost, but Provost survived and established trading posts on the banks of both Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake. The Jordan River was historically named Proveau's Fork. Provost's company of trappers preceded the men of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company in the central Rocky Mountains. In May 1825, he met Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson's Bay Company in Weber Canyon. After returning to St. Louis in 1826, he became an employee of John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company. He continued his own trapping ventures, as well as leading AFC men on ventures on the upper Missouri River. He married in 1829, but continued escorting AFC caravans to the annual rendezvous until 1838. From 1839 until his death in 1850, he continued to recruit and escort the employees of the fur company and various private expeditions, including John Audubon's natural history expedition of 1843. Legacy Provost's activities and explorations were well known among traders and settlers in the American Southwest. The Provo River and Provo Canyon in central Utah are named for the fur trader, as is the adjacent city of Provo. St. Louis, Missouri was home to Provost for many years prior to his death on July 3, 1850.Hafen (1968), 15 His funeral services and burial occurred at the Old Cathedral in St. Louis.Hafen (1968), 15 Provost is memorialized on the This Is the Place Monument in Salt Lake City.

The movement was opposed to what they saw as the growing trends in the mass media for the explicit depiction of sexual and violent themes. Its culmination was a pair of mass rallies in Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park, London in September 1971. It encouraged a number of other campaigns on similar themes, including the continuing Festival of Light movement in Australia, although it did not persist as a high-profile campaign in the UK, and the subsequent growth in the availability of sexually explicit and violent material would suggest that it had little effect on the media or on consumers. History According to the NFOL's official history as written by John Capon, the organisation's genesis was in November 1970, when a young couple, Peter and Janet Hill, returned to England after four years as evangelical Baptist missionaries in India. The Hills experienced a sense of culture shock when they discovered that sexually explicit content was more prevalent in the mass media, in mid-July 1971 the NFOL was founded to oppose \\"pornography and moral pollution\\". Founded by the journalist and author Malcolm Muggeridge alongside \\"clean-up TV\\" campaigner Mary Whitehouse, Labour cabinet member Lord Longford and Peter and Janet Hill, the movement was opposed to what they saw as the growing trends in the mass media for the explicit depiction of sexual and violent themes and for the restoration of conservative Christian morality in the UK. The British pop star Cliff Richard and actress Dora Bryan were key supporters of the NFOL from its onset. Peter Hill imagined tens of thousands of young people marching on London to take a stand for Christian moral principles. The idea took root when he heard of 10,000 men engaged in a March of Witness through Blackburn calling for Christian moral standards to be restored to the nation. Soon, Hill was in contact with a wide network of people, who shared his concern, and offered their encouragement. Among these were Malcolm Muggeridge, Mary Whitehouse, Lord Longford, Bishop Trevor Huddleston and Cliff Richard. Grassroots support came from Anglicans, Baptists, Plymouth Brethren and Pentecostal church denominations. A working committee was established by Hill with Colonel Orde Dobbie (a Social Services administrator), Eddie Stride (a former shop steward and trade unionist, later the Rector of Christ Church, Spitalfields), Gordon Landreth (general secretary of the Evangelical Alliance), Rev. Jean Darnall (Pentecostal evangelist), Nigel Goodwin (a professional Christian actor) and Steve Stevens (a missionary aviator). Additional input was received from a larger Council of Reference which included well-known politicians, lawyers, doctors, trades unionists, bishops, ministers, and other public figures such as Dora Bryan and David Kossoff from the acting profession. The name \\"Festival of Light\\" was suggested by Malcolm Muggeridge, and Prince Charles sent \\"every good wish for the success of the Festival\\". The movement had two expressed aims: to protest against \\"sexploitation\\" in the media and the arts, and to offer the teaching of Christ as the key to recovering moral stability in the nation. Some supporters naturally emphasized the first, and others the second. Plans were made for major public events, including the lighting of beacons on hilltops throughout the United Kingdom, and culminating in a massed march to a public rally in Trafalgar Square and an open-air concert of Christian music in Hyde Park. The administrative task of enlisting the support of Christian churches and denominations throughout the UK was a colossal one, as indeed was the necessity for public relations with the press and the general public. The committee and many local volunteers were occupied with this throughout the first half of 1971. Then on 9 September, an initial rally was held in Westminster Central Hall, where the exploitation of sex and violence in the entertainment industry was denounced; the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) invaded this meeting in drag, releasing mice, sounding horns, and turning off all the lights. Around the country more than seventy regional rallies followed. In Bristol the cathedral was filled to capacity, largely in reaction to the opening of a \\"sex supermarket\\" in the city. A \\"nationwide day of prayer\\" was observed on 19 September. Then on the night of 23 September bonfires and torches were lit on hilltops throughout Britain. In Sheffield a calor gas flare was lit by Cliff Richard. Local authorities were generally co-operative, and individual opposition muted. There were probably about 300 such beacons, and one estimate claimed that 100,000 people took part in local events. On 25 September, approximately 45,000 of the 100,000 predicted people assembled in Trafalgar Square for the NFOL rally. A platform and amplification equipment had been set up, and more than a dozen speakers took the microphone, among them Malcolm Muggeridge, Bill Davidson of the Salvation Army, and Mary Whitehouse. A number of statements and proclamations were read out and received with applause by the crowd. Some called for a halt to the commercial exploitation of sex and violence. They warned that the \\"positive values\\" of love and respect for the individual and the family were under serious threat, and that once these were overthrown a safe and stable society could not long survive. They challenged the nation to recover \\"the pure idealism of Christ, the Light of world, who taught that real love always wants what is best for others and defends the weak against exploitation by the corrupt\\". The speakers were of mixed ages, from many different walks of life. Some of the crowd heckled, but most cheered enthusiastically. Two-thirds of those present were said to be aged under twenty-five. At the conclusion of the speeches, the crowd began to wind through the streets to Hyde Park, singing Christian songs as they went. In Hyde Park they joined those unable to get into Trafalgar Square. The Hyde Park rally started at 4pm, where a number of Christian music groups proclaimed the same message. Among the performers were Cliff Richard, Dana and Graham Kendrick. Rev. Jean Darnall led the rally. The main speaker in the park was Hollywood street evangelist Arthur Blessitt, famous for having travelled all over the globe carrying a 12-foot wooden cross. He said it was only by having \\"a personal relationship with Jesus\\" that the desire for \\"immoral entertainment and illicit behaviour\\" would be eliminated. He invited the crowd to kneel in Hyde Park and make a personal acceptance of Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour, and the vast majority did so. Response In the days that followed, newspaper reports were mixed. Perhaps the warmest support came from Roman Catholic periodicals. Vast quantities of mail continued to pour into the organisers' office, but once they had recovered from the effort entailed in the public events, there seemed a large measure of uncertainty about the next stage, if any. Within the movement itself there had always been diverse emphases and agendas. Those involved had frequently asked whether the Festival of Light should have an overtly Christian identity, or alternatively seek a wider constituency embracing all who would oppose \\"moral pollution\\". In the event it received support from many who had no initial Christian commitment, and some who were drawn to Christianity through the experience. There was also uncertainty whether the intention of the organisers was to demand stricter censorship by law, or to seek a voluntary agreement on standards with the professional regulating bodies in the broadcasting and publishing industries, or simply to persuade individuals and families that they would benefit from opting out of a culture they could not control. The Festival stimulated some inter-denominational contact among evangelical Christians, and is considered to be, along with the Billy Graham campaigns, the Keswick Convention, and the university \\"Christian unions\\" a significant expression of twentieth-century evangelical co-operation in the UK. Proponents claim that many Christians were persuaded to shun violent and sexually explicit films, magazines and television programmes, and to prefer newspapers lacking salacious content. For a decade or more, evangelicals generally held to this position. In the nation as a whole, however, the impact of the Festival was much less evident than supporters had hoped, and it is thought that the openly evangelical positions espoused by the Festival's leaders had alienated a number of people who would otherwise support its aims. A much greater range of explicit material became available in the years which followed. Commercial, political and artistic pressures worked against any attempt at a stricter censorship, either by law or by voluntary agreement. Later developments After 1971 the NFL committee continued to meet and gradually evolved into the Christian organisation Christian Action Research and Education (CARE), changing its name in 1983. The high-profile confrontational style of the original Festival gave way to a more discreet range of initiatives assisting individuals who have suffered the consequences of the perceived moral and social breakdown in British society, and encouraging a measure of political engagement on some issues.

History  Origin  Gdov was established as an outpost of the Pskov Republic. It occupied a strategically important position, being close to Lake Peipus, separating Livonia and Rus. Located on an important road to Pskov, Gdov protected it from the north. Its first mention in the chronicles dates back to 1323. Initially, the fortress was a mixture of wooden and earthen fortifications. However, the level of protection was deemed insufficient against the rising threat of the German incursion. Construction of a stone Kremlin, initially with wooden elements, commenced in 1431. The walls were constructed of alternating layers of boulders and Devonian sandstone, reaching 4 m in thickness and 8 m in height. The Kremlin had become fully stone-built by the middle of the 15th century.  Active service  The Kremlin had been attacked on numerous occasions by German, Polish, and Swedish forces. In March 1480, Gdov was attacked by forces of the Livonian Order that burned the posad and laid siege to the Kremlin, attempting to infiltrate it in a few places at the same time. Vastly outnumbered, the Gdov forces had to use every means of defence available to them, from artillery to burning tar and boiling water, successfully preventing the Order from reaching its goal. The Ingrian War began in 1610, marking the onset of a Swedish invasion. By 1613, the Kremlin was besieged again. The Swedish forces managed to capture it, only to lose control of it later that year. In 1614, another attempt was made, with Gustavus II Adolphus, the King of Sweden personally commanding the operation. The Kremlin fell again remaining under Swedish control until 1621 when a peace treaty was signed under which Gdov was returned to Russia. During the 17th century, the Kremlin was continuously damaged by siege. It sustained major damage to its stonework; signs of explosions have been identified. In 1657, during the course of another Russo‚ÄìSwedish War, it withstood a siege laid by eight thousand soldiers led by Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie. In 1686, the Kremlin was severely damaged by fire. By the end of the century, is started to lose its strategic importance.  Later years  In 1706, Gdov was visited by Tsar Peter the Great. He ordered the walls strengthened by covering them with earth. Currently, the stone towers are also covered by earth, and have been ever since the construction of the town's park took place in the 19th century. Later in the 18th century, when the kremlin had totally fallen into disuse, parts of the walls were taken apart. In 1781, the demolition of the kremlin was temporarily halted by order of Catherine the Great. In February 1944, the Kremlin was razed almost entirely by the retreating forces of Nazi Germany. All the structures within the Kremlin walls, including a cathedral with a 52 m tall bell tower, churches, and hundreds of merchants' houses were destroyed by explosives; only the walls remained.

Although it pioneered a novel rotor and transmission system, it never entered series production. Design and development Work on the GIL-4 began at the G≈Ç√≥wny Instytut Lotnictwa - Main Aviation Institute (GIL), in Warsaw in 1953, under the leadership of Dipl. Ing. Bronis≈Çaw ≈ªurakowski, who had earlier designed the experimental B≈ª-1 GIL helicopter, the first successful rotating-wing aircraft built in Poland. Due to the delicate political situation in postwar Poland (Soviet influences and centrally planned economy), progress was slow. The main object was to produce a simple and inexpensive general use light helicopter and to further development of the novel rotor and transmission system, which eliminates vibration and improves control. .Cynk 1959, p. 72. The B≈ª-4 ≈ªuk was based on a single main three-blade rotor powered by an indigenous Narkiewicz WN-4 piston engine in a fuselage made of a steel frame, behind a cabin section. It had an open frame rear boom structure and a fixed four-wheel undercarriage. Main rotor was atypical, for it had a smaller upper steering rotor and was fitted with an automatic stabilization system, of the Hiller principle. The cabin had four doors with two front seats and a rear bench. There were two fuel tanks, 220 l in total. Four main variants were planned: a passenger version accommodating a pilot and three passengers, an ambulance variant carrying pilot, one stretchers and an attendant, an agricultural variant carrying pilot and spraying or dusting equipment and a dual control trainer. Testing and evaluation The first prototype of the B≈ª-4 ≈ªuk four- seat helicopter was manufactured and displayed publicly in the Polish Aviation Day Exhibition in August 1956. Due to a long program of ground testing and fixing faults, it flew first only on 10 February 1959 and completed 17 flights for a total of 3 hrs, 40 minutes. The ≈ªuk was still in the development stage when further work was cancelled in favor of the licence production of the Mil Mi-1, that had already started in WSK PZL-≈öwidnik. The prototype was damaged during landing on 31 August 1959 and despite being repaired, was not used again. Two additional prototypes were not completed.

He was high priest at the beginning of the Maccabean revolt (167-160). He was the successor of Jason, the brother of Onias III. The sources are divided as to his origin. According to II Maccabees, he belonged to the Tribe of Benjamin and was the brother of the Simeon who had denounced Onias III to Seleucus IV Philopator, and revealed to the Syrians the existence of the treasure of the Temple;2 Maccabees iv. 23. according to Flavius Josephus, Menelaus was the brother of Onias III and Jason, his two predecessors as High Priest, and also bore the name Onias.Ant. xii. 5. It is possible that Josephus confused Simeon, the brother of Menelaus, with Simeon, the father of Onias and Jason. Hellenizing tendencies Although during the three years of his pontificate Jason had given many proofs of his attachment to the Hellenistic party (by building a gymnasium in Jerusalem and by introducing many Greek customs) the Hellenists of the stamp of the Tobiads plotted his overthrow, suspecting him of partiality to traditional Judaism. At their head stood Menelaus. Having been sent to Antiochus to pay the annual tribute, he took the opportunity to outbid Jason and secure for himself the office of high priest. An officer named Sostrates was sent by Antiochus with a troop of Cyprian soldiers to subdue any opposition that might be attempted by the followers of the deposed high priest Jason and to collect at the same time the sum Menelaus had promised. Menelaus' first act was to seize the sacred vessels in the Temple stores in order to meet the obligations he had incurred. This act came to the ears of the deposed high priest Onias III, who publicly accused Menelaus of robbing the Temple. The latter, afraid of the consequences of this accusation, induced the king's lieutenant Andronicus, who had had his share of the plunder, to get rid of Onias before a formal complaint had been lodged with the king. Accordingly, Onias was decoyed from the sanctuary at Daphne, in which he had sought refuge, and murdered. Menelaus continued to plunder the treasures of the Temple until violence ensued, in which his brother Lysimachus met his death. He then brought before the king an accusation against the people of Jerusalem, that they were partisans of the Egyptians and persecuted him only because he was opposed to their party intrigues. This accusation caused the execution of several Jews who, although they proved beyond any doubt that Menelaus and Lysimachus had desecrated the Temple, were sentenced to death. Conflict with Jason Meanwhile, Jason had not abandoned his claims to the high-priesthood, and while (170) Antiochus was waging war against Egypt he succeeded in making himself master of Jerusalem and in forcing Menelaus to seek refuge in the citadel. Antiochus regarded this proceeding as an affront upon his majesty, and, having been compelled by the Romans to leave Egypt, he marched against Jerusalem, massacred the inhabitants, and plundered the Temple; in this he is said to have been assisted by Menelaus. According to II Maccabees, it was Menelaus who persuaded Antiochus to Hellenize the Jewish worship, and thereby brought about the uprising of the Judeans under the guidance of the Maccabees. During the first years of the restoration of the Jewish worship Menelaus still remained (though only nominally) high priest. He is said to have been put to death by Antiochus V Eupator when the latter made definite concessions to the Jews, the reason assigned being that Menelaus, by his counsel, was indirectly responsible for the Jewish rebellion.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest private foundation in the U.S. with over $38 billion in assets.National Center for Charitable Statistics Most private foundations are much smaller. Out of the 84,000 private foundations that filed with the IRS in 2008, Approximately 66% have less than $1 million in assets, and 93% have less than $10 million in assets. In aggregate, private foundations in the U.S. control over $628 billion in assets and made more than $44 billion in charitable contributions in 2007. Unlike a charitable foundation, a private foundation does not generally solicit funds from the public or have the legal requirements and reporting responsibilities of a registered, non-profit or charitable foundation. Not all foundations engage in philanthropy: some private foundations are used for estate planning purposes. Chart of a foundation Description  One of the characteristics of the legal entities existing under the status of \\"Foundations\\" is a wide diversity of structures and purposes. Nevertheless, there are some common structural elements that are the first observed under legal scrutiny or classification. * Legal requirements followed for establishment * Purpose of the foundation * Economic activity * Supervision and management provisions * Accountability and auditing provisions * Provisions for the amendment of the statutes or articles of incorporation * Provisions for the dissolution of the entity * Tax status of corporate and private donors * Tax status of the foundation Some of the above must be, in most jurisdictions, expressed in the document of establishment. Others may be provided by the supervising authority at each particular jurisdiction. Common law The following foundations are set up under common law legal systems: The Bahamas Foundations were first introduced in The Bahamas in December 2004 following the Foundations Act.https://web.archive.org/web/20080514034256/http://www.bfsb- bahamas.com/foundations/index.html United States A private foundation, in the United States, is a charitable organization described in the Internal Revenue Code by section 509. A private foundation is necessarily a 501(c)(3) exempt organization (or a former such entity). It is defined by a negative definition: by what it is not. A private foundation is not a public charity, as described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (i) through (vi). Neither is it a section 509(a)(2) organization, nor a supporting organization. Private foundations are subject to 2% excise taxes found in section 4940 through 4945 of the internal revenue code. Once a charity becomes a private foundation, it retains that status unless it follows the difficult termination rules of section 507. Every organization that qualifies for tax exemption as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) is a private foundation unless it falls into one of the categories specifically excluded from the definition of that term (referred to in section 509(a)). In addition, certain nonexempt charitable trusts are also treated as private foundations. Organizations that fall into the excluded categories are institutions such as hospitals or universities and those that generally have broad public support or actively function in a supporting relationship to such organizations. In the United States, there are several restrictions and requirements on private foundations, including: # restrictions on self-dealing between private foundations and their substantial contributors and other disqualified persons; # requirements that the foundation annually distribute income for charitable purposes; # limits on their holdings in private businesses; # provisions that investments must not jeopardize the carrying out of exempt purposes; and # provisions to assure that expenditures further exempt purposes. Violations of these provisions give rise to taxes and penalties against the private foundation and, in some cases, its managers, its substantial contributors, and certain related persons. Violations of these provisions give rise to taxes and penalties against the private foundation and, in some cases, its managers, its substantial contributors, and certain related persons. Civil law The following foundations are set up under civil law legal systems: Austria The Austrian Private Foundation (Privatstiftung) was last reformed under the Private Foundation Act in September 1993. The Austrian private foundation is considered a legal person having beneficiaries rather than shareholders or proprietors and may be established for any purpose. There are three levels of taxation related to Austrian private foundations: taxation of asset transfers, ongoing taxation of the private foundation's income; and taxation of distributions from the private foundation to beneficiaries. Canada In Canada the Canada Revenue Agency is a branch of the Canadian government which regulates all foundations. Under Canadian law, since 1967, a private foundation is controlled by a single donor or family through a board that is made up of a majority (more than 50%) of directors at non-arm‚Äôs length. It is a legally registered charity with the Canada Revenue Agency. A public foundation is governed by a board that is made up of a majority of directors at arm‚Äôs length. A private foundation is not allowed to engage in any business activity, but it can operate its own charitable program. Canada Revenue Agency designates the application as a ‚Äúcharitable organization,‚Äù a ‚Äúpublic foundation,‚Äù or a ‚Äúprivate foundation,‚Äù depending on its structure, its source of funding and its operation. The Income Tax Act requirements are different, depending on the type of charity.(Canada Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985 (5th supp.) c. 1, para. 149.1(4)(a)) Liechtenstein The Liechtenstein Family Foundation (Stiftung) was first introduced in 1926 and updated by the Act Reforming the Persons and Companies Act in 2008 which included a new Act on Foundations. They are allowed to pursue non-commercial and/or private benefit purposes. Private Benefit Family Foundation pays no taxes. Mauritius The Mauritius Foundation was introduced following 'The Foundations Act' of 2012. Netherlands A foundation in the Netherlands (Stichting) is a legal person created through a legal act. This act is usually either a notarised deed (or a will) that contains the articles of the foundation which must include the first appointed board. Netherlands Antilles Foundation legislation was last reformed in 1998, giving rise to the Netherlands Antilles Private Foundation (Stichting Particulier Fonds). Nevis The Nevis Multiform Foundation was introduced in 2005. Panama The Panama Private Interest Foundation was introduced following the Law 25, June 12, 1995. Saint Kitts The Saint Kitts Foundation was introduced following the Foundation Act of 2003. Seychelles The Seychelles Foundation was introduced following the Foundation Act of 2009. Sweden A private foundation in Sweden (Stiftelse) is formed by a letter of donation from a founder donating funds or assets to be administered for a specific purpose. A private foundation may have diverse purposes, including collective, familiar, or the purpose of passive administration of funds. Normally, the supervision of a private foundation is done by the county government where the foundation has its domicile, however, large foundations must be registered by the County Administrative Board (CAB), which must also supervise the administration of the foundation. The main legal instruments governing private foundations in Sweden are those that regulate foundations in general: the Foundation Act (1994:1220) and the Regulation for Foundations (1995:1280).

Description King's skink is a large, heavy-bodied black skink that can reach a total length (including tail) of with a mass of . Diet King's skink is omnivorous and consumes mostly softer plant matter from the range of local vegetation, but supplements its diet with insects and birds' eggs. As prey King's skink is prey for many animals including tiger snakes (Notechis spp.). History A traditional name for King's skink is wandy, given by the Nyungar people of south-west Western Australia. The first European to draw a King's skink was the artist and naturalist Ferdinand Bauer who made a detailed drawing of one during Flinders' expedition in 1801.

He was one of two founders -with S. H. Foulkes- of the field of group psychotherapy. A prolific writer, he authored 320 research articles and 18 books, many of which were translated into other languages. James Anthony was a training psychoanalyst who studied in London where he began a distinguished career as a child psychotherapist and psychiatrist. He studied child development under Jean Piaget and, after leaving the Maudsley Hospital, occupied the Ittleson Chair of Child Psychiatry, at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. He later became Director of Psychotherapy at Chestnut Lodge, where he developed a program of group psychotherapy for adolescent inpatients. He was President of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), President of the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions, the Association for Child Analysis, and the World Association of Infant Psychiatry. Anthony was recruited from England in 1958 to hold the world‚Äôs first endowed chair in Child Psychiatry, the Blanche F. Ittleson Professorship at Washington University in St. Louis where most of his longitudinal research was conducted. His work in St. Louis at the Edison Child Study Center included many grants from foundations and the NIMH. His collaboration with Foulkes, who became his training analyst, began at Northfield Hospital and in the 1950s he became a founder member of the Group Analytic Society. Anthony was born in Calcutta, India and educated in Darjeeling, India from the age of four and a half by Jesuits before immigrating to England for medical training. He was a prot√©g√© and collaborator with Jean Piaget, Anna Freud, Erik Erikson, John Bowlby and Sir Aubrey Lewis who throughout his early career introduced him to international and cultural aspects of child development. He attended medical school at Kings College during the Second World War, including delivering babies during the bombings of London. His first assignment as an officer was to work at Northfield Military Center with S.H. Foulkes, dealing with \\"shell shocked soldiers\\". There they started rudimentary group psychotherapy. Later he was transferred to Hong Kong as chief medical officer for Southeast Asia and was charged with setting up day care centers for Japanese children who survived the Hiroshima bombings.

He was a senior lecturer at the Hampstead Clinic and received a Nuffield Fellowship to study with Jean Piaget. At the same time his collaboration with S.H. Foulkes on Groups led them to co- author \\"Group Psychotherapy: the Psychoanalytic Approach\\" considered to this day as the bible of group psychotherapy with many reprintings including one this year. During his Presidency of the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions he formed study groups of colleagues from around the world to learn from various cultures about child development and childhood disorders. He initiated this work, led it, and arranged for funding. This effort was the basis of several of his books. As a testament to his lasting legacy and expertise, this spring, two books on the subject contain introductions by Anthony. As AACAP President, he continued his commitment on international collaboration, with both a joint meeting in Mexico, and in leading two large groups to China on the brink of its opening to the West. He collaborated with future AACAP Presidents and co-led other trips including to the USSR. As a result of this trip, for the first time ever, the USSR sent 8 of its researchers to participate in the AACAP‚Äôs annual meeting. Anthony also formed a study group to mentor, nurture, and support young researchers in the beginning of their careers. He was also responsible for the first, of what would later be known as the Presidential Interview at the AACAP Annual Meeting when he interviewed Joan and Erik Erikson. His appointment to the Work Group on Consumer Issues led to the development of AACAP‚Äôs Facts for Families, which have been translated into multiple languages. Also during Anthony‚Äôs AACAP Presidency, a successful offer was made to purchase our (AACAP‚Äôs) current headquarters. He maintained a private practice until the age of 90. He was a member of the British, St. Louis, Chicago, and Washington DC Psychoanalytic Societies. He was married to Ethel Frances until her death in 1983. They have four children, eleven grandchildren and ten great grandchildren. He was married for 30 years to Virginia Quinn Anthony, former executive director of AACAP. Anthony died on December 10, 2014. References *Anthony, E. J.

Balch House is a home located in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States. The Prairie style Balch House was designed by famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1911. The home was the first house Wright designed after returning from a trip to Europe with a client's wife. The subsequent social exile cost the architect friends, clients, and his family. The house is one of the first Wright houses to employ a flat roof which gives the home a horizontal linearity. Historian Thomas O'Gorman noted that the home may provide a glimpse into the subconscious mind of Wright. The Balch house is listed as a contributing property to a U.S. federally Registered Historic District. History The Oscar Balch House was one of the first homes designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright upon his return from an extended trip to Europe, during which he designed no houses.\\"Oscar B. Balch House\\", Oak Park Tourist, excerpted from: Sprague, Paul E. Guide to Frank Lloyd Wright & Prairie School Architecture in Oak Park Oak Park Bicentennial Commission of the American Revolution [and] Oak Park Landmarks Commission, Village of Oak Park: 1986, (). Retrieved 11 June 2007.O'Gorman, Thomas J. Frank Lloyd Wright's Chicago, Thunder Bay Press, San Diego: 2004, pp. 276-77, (). Wright had traveled to Europe with Mamah Borthwick. This flaunting of public morality lost him friends, clients and his family. Amongst those who by contrast stood by Wright was the interior decorator Oscar Balch. Balch was one of two partners in the decorating firm Pebbles & Balch. Wright had previously designed a building remodel for Balch's storefront on Lake Street in Oak Park, in 1907, a structure long since demolished. Architecture The Balch House is one of Wright's first flat-roofed houses and its proportions are taller compared with later flat-roofed homes he designed.Heinz, Thomas A. The Vision of Frank Lloyd Wright, Chartwell Books, Inc., Edison, New Jersey: 2006, pp. 156-57, (). Wright brought new drama to his Prairie style with the addition of the flat roof. The expansive roof further refined the simplicity of Wright's Prairie style house. The house has broad, overhanging eaves, common to Prairie houses and in the case of the Balch House they further emphasize the Prairie theme. The exterior is sheathed in stucco which provides a sculpting effect on the exterior. The original color of the stucco on the exterior is unknown but photographs show that the house has undergone color changes. The design of the house is symbolic in its heightened terrace walls, the security walls and its hidden and obscured entryway. The house clearly shows the signs of someone who feels trapped or \\"under siege.\\" The events of Wright's personal life may be reflected in the design of the Balch House. Regardless, the house has a remarkable linear proportion and Wright managed to raise the eyeline with the rows of windows on the home's second floor. The home is part of a series of geometric, cubic homes with overhanging, flat roofs designed by Wright in the early 20th century. The first was the Laura Gale House in Oak Park, Illinois, followed by the Oscar B. Balch House, also in Oak Park, Coonley Kindergarten, the Bogh House and then the Bach House.\\"Emil Bach House\\", (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 5 June 2007. The first floor plan is similar to the Edwin H. Cheney House; both have a three part first floor layout that includes a library, a dining room and a living room. The interior spaces are separated by \\"low decks set at the window heads.\\" In the living room the house is anchored by a Roman brick fireplace at its center and there are libraries on either side of two small setback pavilions. These features help the building's interior flow and symmetry. Copious use of glass brings natural light into the interior. Significance The Oscar Balch House represents Frank Lloyd Wright's defiant return to the streets of Oak Park and to architecture after his absence and concurrent trip to Europe with Mamah Borthwick Cheney. The house was called \\"forged of Wright's personal courage and cheeky moral humbridge\\" by historian Thomas O'Gorman. O'Gorman concluded it was possible that the Balch House provides a rare glimpse into the subconscious mind of Frank Lloyd Wright. The Balch House is an example of Frank Lloyd Wright's fully mature Prairie style. Its flat roof and horizontal linearity are a continuation of the ideas Wright began to manifest in the Mrs. Thomas H. Gale House in 1909. The Oscar B. Balch House is listed as a contributing property to the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District.\\"Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District\\", Property Information Report-District listing, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

The larger area is in the south, and consists of the former town of Kanita with a coastline on Mutsu Bay, and the former village of Tairadate in the centre of northern Tsugaru Peninsula. The smaller area is in the north, and consists of the former village of Minmaya with a coastline on the Tsugaru Strait. Much of the town is within the limits of the Tsugaru Quasi-National Park. Most of the settlements and arable land are located along the coastline, with about 89% of the total area of town as mountainous national forest. Neighbouring municipalities Aomori Prefecture *Goshogawara *Imabetsu *Nakadomari *Yomogita Climate The town has a cold humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Cfb) characterized by warm short summers and long cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Sotogahama is 10.0 ¬∞C. The average annual rainfall is 1267 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.8 ¬∞C, and lowest in January, at around -1.8 ¬∞C.Sotogahama climate data Demographics Per Japanese census data,Sotogahama population statistics the population of Sotogahama has decreased by more than half over the past 60 years and is now considerably less than it was a century ago. History The Tsugaru Peninsula has been inhabited since Japanese Paleolithic times, and some of the world's oldest pottery has been discovered at the Odai Yamamoto I site. The area around Sotogahama was controlled by the Tsugaru clan of Hirosaki Domain during the Edo period. During the post-Meiji restoration establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889 Minmaya, Kanita and Tairadate villages were separated from Imabetsu. On March 28, 2005, these three municipalities merged to form the new town of Sotogahama. Minmaya is a geographically discontinuous enclave from the town's center in Kanita. Government Sotogahama has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town legislature of 11 members. Higashitsugaru District contributes one member to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Aomori 1st district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Economy The economy of Sotogahama is heavily dependent on commercial fishing. Some of the locally caught seafood include sea urchin roe, sea pineapple, sea cucumber, scallops, abalone and squid. Education Sotogahama has three public elementary schools and three public junior high schools operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

This region comprises 60% of the country and is marked by a large degree of biodiversity. Peru has the second-largest portion of the Amazon rainforest after the Brazilian Amazon.  Extension  Most Peruvian territory is covered by dense forests on the east side of the Andes, yet only 5% of Peruvians live in this area. More than 60% of Peruvian territory is covered by the Amazon rainforest, more than in any other country. According to the Research Institute of the Peruvian Amazon (Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazon√≠a Peruana, IIAP), the spatial delineation of the Peruvian Amazon is as follows: * Ecological criteria: 782,880.55 km¬≤ (60.91% of Peruvian territory and approximately 11.05% of the entire Amazon jungle). * Hydrographic criteria or basin criteria: (75.31% of Peruvian territory and approximately 16.13% of the whole Amazon basin).  Ecoregions and climate  The Peruvian Amazon is traditionally divided into two distinct ecoregions: The lowland jungle (in Spanish Selva Baja) is also known as Omagua region, Walla, Anti, Amazonian rainforest or Amazon basin. This ecoregion is the largest of Peru, standing between 80 and 1,000 meters above sea level. It has very warm weather with an average temperature of 28 ¬∞C, high relative humidity (over 75%) and yearly rainfall of approximately . Its soils are very heterogeneous, but almost all have river origins. Because of high temperatures and high rainfall, they are poor soils with few nutrients. The jungle contains long and powerful rivers such as the Apurimac, Mantaro, Amazon, Urubamba, Ucayali, Huallaga, Mara√±√≥n, Putumayo, Yavar√≠, Napo, Pastaza, Madre de Dios, Manu, Purus, and Tigre. The Apurimac River is the source of the Amazon River. The Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, the Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve and the Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Regional Conservation Area are within the forest. The highland jungle (in Spanish Selva Alta) is also called Rupa Rupa region, Andean jungle, ceja de selva. This ecoregion extends into the eastern foothills of the Andes, between 1,000 and 3,800 m above the sea level. The eastern slopes of the Andes are home to a great variety of fauna and flora because of the different altitudes and climates within the region. Temperatures are warm in the lowlands and cooler in higher altitudes. There are many endemic fauna because of the isolation caused by the rugged terrain of the area.Pulgar Vidal, Javier: Geograf√≠a del Per√∫; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Per√∫. Edit.

Within the Amazon rain forest there are several other types of forest But they all have one characteristic in common: abundant rains. Over the course of a year, a portion of tropical forest will receive between 1,500 and 3,000 mm of rain. This creates the typical tropical atmosphere of a rain forest, with an average temperature of around 24 ¬∞ C or more.https://wwf.panda.org/es/que_hacemos/sitios_prioritarios/amazonia/la_amazonia_naturaleza/ecosistemas/  Biodiversity  The Peruvian Amazon jungle is one of the most biologically diverse areas on Earth. As a nation, Peru has the largest number of bird species in the world and the third-largest number of mammals; 44% of bird species and 63% of mammal species inhabit the Peruvian Amazon. Peru also has a very high number of species of butterflies, orchids, and other organisms.This table was elaborated by Edwin Jes√∫s Villacorta Monz√≥n, with data obtained among many sources from years 1997, 2001 and 2006. {    Taxa  colspan=\\"3\\" Number of known species  colspan=\\"2\\" Percentage of species |-  In the world  In Peru  In the Peruvian Amazon  Peru vs. world  Peruvian Amazon vs. Peru |- !

Many indigenous peoples, such as the Aguaruna, Cocama-Cocamilla and the Urarina,Dean, Bartholomew 2009 Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia, Gainesville: University Press of Florida inhabit the jungle, some in relative isolation from the rest of the world. The primary cities located in the Peruvian Amazon include: * Lowland jungle ** Iquitos with 500,000 inhabitants at 104 m (Loreto region) ** Pucallpa, with 380,000 inhabitants at 154 m (Ucayali region) ** Yurimaguas with 140,000 inhabitants at 182 m (Loreto region) ** Puerto Maldonado with 104,000 inhabitants at 139 m (Madre de Dios region) ** Tarapoto with 181,000 inhabitants at 350 m (San Mart√≠n region) ** Ja√©n with 86,743 inhabitants at 729 m (Cajamarca region) ** Moyobamba with 77,000 inhabitants at 860 m (San Mart√≠n region) ** Bagua with 65,000 inh. at 400 m (Amazonas region) ** Rioja with 60,000 inh. at 848 m (at San Mart√≠n region) Illegal logging Over the last decades illegal logging has become a serious problem in the Peruvian Amazon. In 2012 the World Bank estimated that 80% of Peru‚Äôs timber exports are illegally harvested.World Bank (2012) Justice for Forests. Improving Criminal Justice Efforts to Combat Illegal Logging. Washington, DC: Pereira Goncalves, P., Panjer, M., Greenberg, T. S. & Magrath, W.B. This uncontrolled deforestation could negatively affect the habitats of indigenous tribes, the Peruvian biodiversity and contribute to climate change. Moreover, illegal deforestation might lead to more violent crimes. This has already been demonstrated on 1 September 2014, when four indigenous leaders were murdered, including the famous environmental activist Edwin Chota. These leaders were asking for governmental protection against illegal loggers, after being threatened several times. Partly due to this, illegal loggers are being blamed for the assassination.Collins, D. (2014). Illegal loggers blamed for murder of Peru forest campaigner. Emergence of illegal industry In an attempt to support local incomes in the Amazon, the Peruvian government granted non- transferable contracts to individual farmers to perform small-scale logging activities. Soon however, big logging companies started paying individual loggers for the use of their contracts and established an illegal, large-scale logging industry.Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). La M√°quina Lavadora, p. 8 In 1992 the National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA) was founded to guarantee a more sustainable use of national resources.Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). La M√°quina Lavadora, p. 20 Yet, this institution has never been able to carry out its task due to several reasons. First of all, INRENA lacked sufficient resources compared with the magnitude of their responsibilities.Smith, J., Colan, V., Sabogal, C., & Snook, L. (2006). Why policy reforms fail to improve logging practices: The role of governance and norms in Peru. Forest Policy and Economics, 8(4), 466. Next to this, corruption was a problem in several layers of the organisation.Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). La M√°quina Lavadora, p. 20 Moreover, until recently, INRENA was part of the Ministry of Agriculture.Smith, J., Colan, V., Sabogal, C., & Snook, L. (2006). Why policy reforms fail to improve logging practices: The role of governance and norms in Peru. Forest Policy and Economics, 8(4), 463. This suggests that INRENA was not completely independent; it was housed in an institution that had to safeguard the interest of the agricultural sector, which could be conflicting with INRENA‚Äôs objective. In 2000 Peru modified the Forestry and Wildlife Law in order to improve the logging sector.Naughton-Treves, L. Deforestation and carbon emissions at tropical frontiers: a case study from the Peruvian Amazon. World Development 32.1 (2004): 185 In the subsequent years however, the situation in the Peruvian timber industry only deteriorated. To some extent this can be explained by the fact that Brazil illegalised the exports of mahogany (one of the most valuable and endangered types of wood in the world) from 2001 on.Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). La M√°quina Lavadora, p. 6 This Brazilian ban is likely to have caused the increase in Peruvian mahogany exports. Soon after the ban, international institutions revealed their severe concerns about the state of the Peruvian timber industry. In particular the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), started paying extra attention to Peru as the trade in mahogany falls under CITES‚Äô regulation. Albeit the fact that from then on, one needed special permits for harvesting and exporting any endangered species, the forestry sector was still far from sustainable. Illegal logging with permits Although it is understandable that illegal logging cannot be stopped easily in the Peruvian Amazons (an inaccessible area bigger than Spain), the illegal exportation of timber is supposed to be more difficult; the shipments are huge and there are very few routes from the Amazons to the coast. Nevertheless, until now it has been relatively easy for companies to ship and export illegal timber. Despite the fact that the Peruvian government claims that it does not know anything about the method used by these companies, it is common-knowledge.Matalon, L. (2014). Building a Template for Sustainable Forestry. Revista: Harvard Review of Latin America, Peru 20-24. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) provided a clear picture of this mechanism in their report The Laundering Machine. According to them, the biggest flaw in the Peruvian system for years has been the granting of logging permits: ‚ÄòConcessionaires submit for approval lists that do not exist in the real world, and complicit authorities approve the extraction of this non-existent wood‚Äô.Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). La M√°quina Lavadora, p. 4 These permits allow companies to transport almost all sorts of wood (both legal and illegal) out of the country. There are only two ways to stop illegal loggers: catching them in the act, or, in case of controlling a shipment, environmental prosecutors have to prove that the timber does not come from the place written on the permit (which is only possible by going to this place). With not more than a hundred environmental prosecutors in Peru, it is not surprising that both methods are far from effective. The American-Peruvian Free Trade Agreement The international attention levels increased again in 2007, when Peru and the United States (US) agreed on a new Free Trade agreement (FTA), which was implemented in 2009. According to the United States Trade Representative (USTR) the FTA included a number of binding commitments to ensure environmental protection, focussing on the Peruvian forestry sector.United States Trade Representative (2013). UNITED STATES ‚Äì PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT: STRENGTHENING FOREST SECTOR GOVERNANCE IN PERU. Both parties agreed, amongst others, on the following measures: establishing an independent forestry oversight body, penalising those who committed logging crimes, creating new (and a better implementation of existing) laws, developing an anti-corruption plan and the US would provide monetary help.United States Trade Representative (2013). UNITED STATES ‚Äì PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT: STRENGTHENING FOREST SECTOR GOVERNANCE IN PERU. Yet the results are ambiguous. On the one hand proponents claim that the forestry sector experienced significant improvements. Some (small) improvements are indeed visible. With the formation of the Supervisory Body of Forest and Wildlife Resources (OSINFOR),http://www.osinfor.gob.pe/osinfor/ the first promise was met. Next to this, US officials started training Peruvian law enforcement officers, although only on a minor scale. On the other hand, the FTA caused a lot of social unrest as indigenous groups expected the FTA to ‚Äògive incentives for further and irreversible destruction of virgin rainforest‚Äô.Asociac√≠on Inter√©tnica de Desarrollo de la Selva Peruanana (2007). Peru‚Äôs mahogany exports threaten survival of indigenous tribes and violate international environmental laws. Local communities were not the only ones who criticised the agreement. In 2010 Public Citizen published an article, which stated that, despite all promises, ‚Äòenvironmental and labour conditions in Peru have deteriorated rapidly since the congressional passage of the FTA‚Äô.Public Citizen (2010). A Year after Implementation of Peru Free Trade Agreement, U.S. and Peru Left with Broken Promises and No New Trade Model. Washington, DC: McArthur, T. & Tucker T. Notwithstanding who was right, the FTA has not prevented illegal timber trade between Peru and the US. At least 35% of the Peruvian timber exports to the US between 2008 and 2010, contained illegal wood.Environmental Investigation Agency (2012). La M√°quina Lavadora, p. 3 This percentage however, only covers the trade in species that are regulated by the CITES. As only very few types of timber fall under this legislation, the real percentage of illegally harvested timber in Peru is assumed to be significantly higher. Illegal gold mining Illegal gold mining is rampant among the Madre de Dios Region of Peru, and is extremely harmful to the environment. Individuals are mining more gold each year because of the exponential price hike in this commodity ‚Äì a 360% surge in the last ten years.\\"Overview.\\" Amazon Conservation Association, About,.

The harmful impacts of gold mining in Madre De Dios can be seen from space. Illegal oil extraction Oil extraction is a critical threat to the health of Peruvian Amazonia. While the land is potentially oil-rich, there are also many indigenous peoples living within the Amazon rainforest. The Camisea Gas Project on Lot 88 impacts the daily lives of indigenous residents.\\"Oil and Gas Extraction in the Amazon: Camisea.\\" WWF -. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.

Since the Iranian revolution of 1979, Iran has had some difficult relations with Western countries, especially the United States. Iran has been under constant US unilateral sanctions, which were tightened under the presidency of Bill Clinton. Iran has had a civilian nuclear program since before the 1979 revolution. However, since the revolution, as Iran's regime and overal policies have drastically changed, there have been some worries concerns that it could use this program to develop nuclear weapons. These worries have been raised by the revelation, on August 2002, by Alireza Jafarzadeh, a prominent associate of MKO, of the existence of two secret nuclear sites: a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz (part of which is underground), and a heavy water facility in Arak. There is however no proof at this stage that this program is not purely civilian. At the same time, Iran has been accused by the United States of supporting extremist Islamic movements in the Middle East and supplying militias in Iraq, but has no shown proof or evidence. Iran has also directed strong rhetoric towards Israel, including questioning the legitimacy of its existence and its treatment of Palestinians. Because of these factors, tensions between some states and Iran has degenerated into what some politicians, like Romano Prodi,Iran nuclear Prime Minister of Italy or journalists call an \\"international crisis\\", up the point where the United States and Israel have refused to exclude the use of force to stop the Iranian nuclear program, although they have always stressed that they consider the use of force as a last resort. Nuclear controversy Diplomatic activity linked to Iranian nuclear program The Iranian nuclear program has been controversial as, although the development of a civilian nuclear power program, including enrichment activities, is explicitly allowed under the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), there have been allegations that Iran has been illicitly pursuing a nuclear weapons program, in violation of the NPT (see Iran and weapons of mass destruction). Under the leadership of the United States and of the European Union, the international community has requested the end of enrichment activities in Iran. The 118 member states of the Non-Aligned Movement however have backed Iran's right to \\"acquire peaceful nuclear technology\\".Fars News Agency, Jan 18, 2007. Link: This diplomatic effort culminated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737, adopted (after a significant amount of diplomatic efforts) with the approval of both China and Russia (which held veto power). This resolution imposes specific, but light, economic sanctions solely linked to Iran's nuclear program. The resolution mentions that in the event that \\"Iran has not complied with this resolution, [the security council will] adopt further appropriate measures under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to persuade Iran to comply with this resolution and the requirements of the IAEA, and underlines that further decisions will be required should such additional measures be necessary.\\" According to the resolution, Iran must comply within 60 days, i.e. before 20 February 2007. Iran has strongly rejected this resolution. Iran's parliament passed a bill on 27 December 2006 obliging the government to \\"revise\\" its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and to accelerate its drive to master nuclear technology in a reaction to the U.N. resolution. The bill gave President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government a free hand to adopt a tougher line against the IAEA, including ending its inspections of Iran's atomic facilities. On March 2, 2007, six key nations, including the 5 permanent members of the UN Security Council, which hold veto power, have agreed to pass a new resolution to impose tougher sanctions on Iran regarding its nuclear issue at the United Nations Security Council, French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said. In March 2007, Russia announced that construction of a nuclear reactor would be delayed at least two months because Iran had failed to make monthly payments since January. It said the delay could cause \\"irreversible\\" damage to the project. Because of the delay, Russia also indefinitely put off the delivery of enriched uranium fuel it had promised to provide Iran in March. Iran, which denied falling behind in payments, was furious, convinced Russia was pressuring the country to bend to the U.N. Security Council, which has placed sanctions against it for refusing to suspend uranium enrichment. The pattern of Russia's behavior has strengthened Iran's determination to obtain the full technology to build nuclear power plants and end its dependence because they say Russia has never been and will never be a reliable partner. Accusation of hypocrisy and double standards by Iran toward the West On February 20, 2007, before the expiration of the United Nations Security Council deadline asking Iran to suspend uraninium enrichment, Ali Larijani, Iran's Head of the National Security Council, warned that ‚Äúdouble standards will severely damage the credibility of international bodies‚Äú. ‚ÄúI think certain countries are seeking adventure on Iran‚Äôs nuclear case. You know that some countries until now have not signed the NPT, but are conducting nuclear activities,‚Äú he said, regretting that no action has been taken against such countries while the UN Security Council has passed a resolution against Iran. On March 18, 2007, Iran, under fire from Western powers over its atomic program, criticized Britain's plans to renew its nuclear arsenal as a \\"serious setback\\" to international disarmament efforts. Britain's parliament backed Prime Minister Tony Blair's plans to renew the country's Trident missile nuclear weapons system. \\"Britain does not have the right to question others when they're not complying with their obligations\\" referring to the obligation by the U.K., United States, Russia and France to disarm under the NPT accord and \\"It is very unfortunate that the UK, which is always calling for non-proliferation not only has not given up the weapons but has taken a serious step toward further development of nuclear weapons,\\" Iran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told a conference examining the Trident decision.https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070316/wl_nm/iran_nuclear_britain_dc_1 In a Question and Answer session following his address to Columbia University on September 24, 2007, the Iranian President remarked: \\"I think the politicians who are after atomic bombs, or testing them, making them, politically they are backward, retarded.\\"Ahmadinejad's Performance Gets Mixed Reaction From Iranians Radio Free Europe September 25, 2007 Opposition inside Iran to nuclear energy policy On 20 February 2007, one small radical reformist political party, the Islamic Revolutionary Mujahadin Organisation, has complained that Iran's drive to produce nuclear energy has endangered national security, the national interest and the destiny of the Iranian people. On 26 February 2007, the conservative daily Resalat chided Ahmadinejad, saying \\"neither weakness nor unnecessarily offensive language is acceptable in foreign policy.\\" Statements by Iranian leaders against Israel Iranian leaders have made vehement declarations against Israel. Ahmadinejad was widely reported as calling for Israel to be \\"wiped off the map.\\"AL Jazeera Article: Iranian leadership calls against Israel's existence However, this translation is disputed, and some have considered it a psyop\\"Lost in translation\\", by Jonathan Steele, The Guardian, 2006-06-14 (See: Translation of phrase \\"wiped off the map\\").

Rather, they wish to allow Palestinian refugees to return to Palestine, whereupon all inhabitants will vote on its political future. These \\"clarifications\\" are seen in Israel as a diplomatic smokescreen. \\"For many long years, we have followed Iran's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, in the guise of a civilian nuclear program,\\" said Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert. In November 2003, Israel‚Äôs defence minister Shaul Mofaz has made what sources have described as a warning of \\"unprecedented severity.\\" Mofaz set out his government‚Äôs position last week during a visit to the United States stating that \\"under no circumstances would Israel be able to tolerate nuclear weapons in Iranian possession\\".Israel threatens strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, Ross Dunn, Scotsman.com, Nov 23, 2003 Support of \\"Islamism\\" The Islamic Republic funds and arms militant groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. The U.S. State Department claims this makes Iran an active sponsor of terrorism.State Sponsors of Terror Overview April 28, 2006 Iran was added in 1984 on the U.S. list of state sponsors of international terrorism. According to the State Department, Iran \\"continued to provide Lebanese Hezbollah and the Palestinian rejectionist groups‚Äînotably Hamas, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, and the PFLP-GC‚Äîwith varying amounts of funding, safe haven, training, and weapons. It also encouraged Hezbollah and the rejectionist Palestinian groups to coordinate their planning and to escalate their activities.\\" Iranian activity in Iraq Iran has taken an active role in Iraq. Talks between the two nations (Iran and Iraq) have been successful, with Iran even going so far as to build a major Iranian Bank branch inside Iraq. Iran stresses that it supports the government of Iraq. Indeed, the main party that supports the Iraqi government and the US coalition, SCIRI, is also close to Iran. Its leader, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who has been invited at the White House, was a refugee in Iran when Saddam Hussein was the leader of Iraq. On 21 February 2007, his own son, coming from Iran with armed guards, was arrested by US forces and later released with excuses by US forces. The US have, however, contended that Iran supports some Shiite militias that are alleged to be against the Iraq government, especially the Mahdi army of Muqtada al-Sadr. According to the Iranian ambassador to Iraq, the US is currently detaining 6 Iranian diplomats and 30 Iranian nationals in Iraq.Lake, Eli. \\"Yanks Holding 36 Iranians, Tehran Regime Charges\\", The New York Sun, February 7, 2007. Retrieved February 8, 2007. This number has neither been confirmed nor denied by US officials. On February 28, 2007, the United States however agreed to participate to an international conference to be called by the government of Iraq to discuss Iraq security crisis, where the government of Iran is also invited. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that the United States would join the meeting and that Washington supported the Iraqi government's invitation to Iran and Syria. Iranian officials arrested by US forces in Baghdad On December 25, 2006, the United States arrested at least four senior military officials on their visit to Baghdad.White House: Officials Investigating Iranians Detained in Iraq , December 25, 2006 It has been mentioned that the Iranians have been arrested after US soldiers raided the compound of Shiite leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the influential Shiite Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). President of Iraq Talabani, a strong US ally, has asked for their release. Hiwa Othman, Talabani's media adviser, told Reuters: \\"The president is unhappy. He is talking to the Americans about it as we speak.\\" Othman said the Iranian diplomats came to Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi leader but he was not aware if they had met with him.\\"The invitation was within the framework of an agreement between Iran and Iraq to improve the security situation.\\" Finally, it seems that they have been released on 30 December. One of the commanders, identified by officials simply as Chizari, was the third-highest-ranking official of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' al-Quds Brigade, the unit most active in aiding, arming and training groups outside Iran, including Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, U.S. officials said. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which mentions as a source \\"American intelligence officials\\", without naming them, Iran \\"is working closely with both the Shiite militias and Sunni Jihadist groups\\" in order to stymie a secular government in Iraq.Iran's secret plan for mayhem On 4 January 2007, the BBC's flagship political programme Newsnight cited British authorities in Iraq as saying that while the arrests produced highly important intelligence information, there was no \\"smoking gun\\" about weapons supplies or attacks. \\"There was discussion of whether the Maliki government would succeed, who should be in which ministerial jobs... It was a very significant meeting,\\" one official said. The BBC said US sensitivity to the matter comes from discovering evidence that Iran is trying to turn the situation in Iraq to its advantage, to the extent of trying to influence the make-up of the Baghdad government. Attack by US forces on an Iranian consulate in Irbil Five United States helicopters landed on the roof of the consulate in the northern city of Irbil. American soldiers broke down the doors, detained five people and took away papers and computers. The raid came as American leaders step up their rhetoric against Iran. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tehran is arming the insurgents in Iraq.Iran Protests Consulate Raid In Iraq An Iranian foreign ministry official in a meeting with the Iraqi ambassador to Tehran here on Friday stressed that Baghdad should not allow the United States to interfere in Iran- Iraq relations. \\"We expect the Iraqi government to take immediate measures to set the aforesaid individuals free and to condemn the U.S. troopers for the measure,\\" the official stressed. For his part, Iraqi ambassador to Tehran expressed regret over the incident and pledged to pursue the case through the officials of his country.Tehran Calls on Iraq to Stop U.S. Intervention in Iran-Iraq Ties According to Associated Press, The Iraqi foreign minister called Sunday 14 January for the release of five Iranians detained by U.S. forces in what he said was a legitimate mission in northern Iraq. US accusation of supporting attacks on American troops In his January 10, 2007 address to the nation, President Bush asserted that succeeding in Iraq begins with addressing Iran and Syria. \\"Iran is providing material support for attacks on American troops. We will disrupt the attacks on our forces. We'll interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria. And we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq,\\" Bush said.President's Address to the Nation, The White House, January 10, 2007. Retrieved February 1, 2007. During the following weeks, Bush's statements were criticized for preparing the US for an attack on Iran without Congressional approval. His actions with regards to Iran were also called \\"offensive and provocative.\\"President's Actions Could Lead to Impeachment On 2 February 2007, Bush administration officials acknowledged that they had yet to compile evidence strong enough to back up publicly their claims that Iran is fomenting violence against U.S. troops in Iraq. On 12 February 2007, US administration organized a briefing in Bagdad to make their case. Journalists were told that the use of the deadliest form of roadside bomb known as EFP's ‚Äì explosively formed penetrators ‚Äì had nearly doubled last year. They were said there was a \\"growing body of evidence pointing to Iranian supply of EFPs to Iraqi extremist groups\\". \\"They condemn us for making problems in Iraq, but they don't have any documentary proof,\\" Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hossaini told reporters. \\"Lots of this evidence is fake, artificial. For example, when they wanted to start a war in Iraq, they made plenty of evidence that there were lots of weapons in Iraq, though the investigators of the International Atomic Energy Agency said they couldn't find any weapons in Iraq,\\" he said. \\"Right now they're using weapons [with certain markings], but it doesn't prove where these weapons came from.

The first U.S. sanctions against Iran were formalized in November 1979, and during the hostage crisis, many sanctions were leveled against the Iranian government. By 1987 the import of Iranian goods into the United States had been banned. In 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12957, banning U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, followed a few weeks later by Executive Order 12959 of May 9, 1995, eliminating all trade and investment and virtually all interaction between the United States and Iran. For details of current US sanctions, see the page of US Treasury. The United States have not been followed yet by other countries. But the UN sanctions are the first international sanctions levied on Iran. The United States is pushing for more economic sanctions against Iran. Under a proposal by Germany, which holds the EU presidency during the first semester of 2007, the European Union is also considering imposing sanctions that go beyond the UN sanctions but has not made any decision yet. In June 2007 leading EU countries including Britain, France and Germany cautioned Iran that it faces further sanctions for expanding uranium enrichment and curbing U.N. inspectors' access to its nuclear program. \\"Iran continues to ignore its obligations and has not taken any steps to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its program\\". Additionally, the EU offers Iran suspension of sanctions and a package of trade and industrial benefits if it suspends its nuclear program. The Iran Sanctions Enhancement Act of 2007, introduced by Representative Mark Kirk, Republican‚ÄìIL, and Representative Rob Andrews, Democrat-New Jersey, would threaten sanctions against any company or individual that provides Iran with refined petroleum products or engages in an activity that could contribute to the enhancement of Iran's ability to import refined products after December 31. The bill could potentially lead to sanctions against gasoline brokers, tankers and insurers. Alleged preparation for a war United States and Israel have refused to exclude the use of force to stop the Iranian nuclear program. They have, however, always stressed that they consider the use of force as a last resort. Starting in 2005, several analysts, including journalist Seymour Hersh, former UN weapons of mass destruction inspector in Iraq from 1991‚Äì1998, Scott Ritter, Joseph Cirincione, director for non-proliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Professor at the University of San Francisco and Middle East editor for the Foreign Policy in Focus Project, Stephen Zunes claimed that the United States planned a military attack against Iran. Dec 19, 2006: According to CBS News report, the Pentagon is planning to bolster its presence in the Persian Gulf as a warning to Iran's continuously defiant government. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin says the U.S. military build-up, which would include adding a second aircraft carrier to the one already in the Gulf, is being proposed as a response to what U.S. officials view as an increasingly provocative Iranian leadership. Dec 22, 2006: US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that an increased US naval presence in the Persian Gulf is not a response to any action by Iran but a message that the United States will keep and maintain its regional footprint \\"for a long time.\\" Jan 6, 2007, a news agency reported that Israeli military sources had revealed a plan to strike the enrichment plant at Natanz using low-yield nuclear \\"bunker-busters.\\"Israel has plans for nuclear strike on Iran: paper Reuters The disclosure may have been done to increase pressure on Iran to cease enrichment activities. The Israeli government denied this report. In Tehran, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told a news conference that the newspaper report \\"will make clear to the world public opinion that the Zionist regime is the main menace to global peace and the region.\\" He said \\"any measure against Iran will not be left without a response and the invader will regret its act immediately.\\". Jan 11, 2007: Administration officials said that the battle group would be stationed within quick sailing distance of Iran, a response to the growing concern that Iran is building up its own missile capacity and naval power, with the goal of military dominance in the Gulf. Jan 12, 2007: President Bush accused Iran in a speech this week of helping launch attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq. His remarks were followed by combative comments from his top war advisors, new moves by U.S. naval forces and a raid Thursday in the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil. The administration moved Friday 12 January to defuse concerns that it was planning or inviting a confrontation with Tehran. At a news conference, White House Press Secretary Tony Snow dismissed as an \\"urban legend\\" suggestions that the United States was preparing for another war. Similar denials were issued by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Marine Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Jan 14, 2007: A former Russian Black Sea Fleet Commander, Admiral Edward Baltin, says he believes the presence of so many US nuclear submarines in the Persian Gulf meant a strike was likely.Russian admiral: Numerous US nuclear subs signals imminent strike on Iran Jan 24, 2007: Iranian officials said Wednesday that they had received a delivery of advanced Russian air defense systems that are designed to protect its nuclear facilities at Isfahan, Bushehr, Tehran, and eastern Iran from attack, primarily from Israeli or American aircraft. Feb 18, 2007: According to Scott Ritter, who reiterated his view that Iran will be attacked by the US, the Pentagon has negotiated basing rights in Romania and Bulgaria so that B-1 and B-2 bombers can operate out of airfields there. Jul 6, 2009: It was reported that Joe Biden gave a green light to Israel for a military attack on Iran, however it was a misunderstanding, no green light was given to attack. Opposition to a possible war Organized opposition to a possible future military attack against Iran by the United States (US) is known to have started during 2005‚Äì2006. Beginning in early 2005, journalists, activists, and academics such as Seymour Hersh, Scott Ritter, Joseph Cirincione, and Jorge E. Hirsch began publishing claims that American concerns over the alleged threat posed by Iran's nuclear program might lead the US government to take military action against that country in the future. These reports, and the concurrent escalation of tensions between Iran and some Western governments, prompted the formation of grassroots organisations, including Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran in the US and the United Kingdom, to advocate against potential military strikes on Iran. Additionally, several organizations and individuals, including the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, a former United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq, Scott Ritter, the Non-Aligned Movement of 118 states, and the Arab League, have publicly stated their opposition to a would- be attack on Iran.

Holbrook House falls within the eastern perimeter of the hamlet, build in an Italian Neoclassical architecture style. Robert Henry Hurst (senior), Member of Parliament for Horsham between 1832‚Äì1841 and 1844‚Äì1857, lived in the property. Apartments and residential housing now exist in this estate.W.S.R.O., SP 693 The construction of the A264 North Horsham bypass in 1989 re-defined the boundaries of Graylands. The hamlet was no longer directly connected to Horsham proper due to the A road, insulating Graylands from any urban development.

Giuseppe Alessandro Furietti (24 January 1685 - 14 January 1764) was a Roman Catholic cardinal, an antiquarian and philologist, and a collector of antiquities whose ambitious excavations at the site of Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli rewarded him with the Furietti Centaurs and other Roman sculpture. Biography Furietti was born at Bergamo, Antonio Furietti, the uncle of Giuseppe Alessandro the son of Giovanni Marco Sonzogni Furietti, noble, of a local branch of the Sonzogni.Antonio Furietti. He was educated at the Almo Collegio Borromeo, Pavia,Almo Collegio Borromeo . then at the University of Pavia, where he received his doctorate in canon and civil law (utroque iure). In spite of his distinguished service to the Apostolic Camera,In 1743 Benedict appointed Furietti to his own former post, secretary to the sacra congregazione dell' concilio (Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica da S. Pietro sino ai nostri giorni 1844:75-77). and Furietti's dedication of a book on mosaics to him, the cardinal's hat was withheld by Pope Benedict XIV partly in pique for Furietti's refusal to part with the famous marble centaurs for the Museo Capitolino,Moroni 1744; Miranda. which had opened in 1734. Furietti was eventually created cardinal priest, by Clement XIII in the consistory of 24 September 1759. For a sum, Furietti obtained rights to excavate the section of Hadrian's Villa that belonged to Simplicio Bulgarini. As early as 1724, Conte Giuseppe Fede had been buying up parcels of land in the extensive villa, which had become divided up among a multitude of owners,Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900 (Yale University Press) 1981: forming the nucleus of one of the outstanding recently formed and non-papal collections of antiquities in Rome. After only a few days Furietti's crews found the famous statues of Centaurs signed by Aristeas and Papias, the \\"Furietti Centaurs\\", which quickly became two of the most celebrated sculptures in Rome, in part through the engravings of them made in 1739 and 1740 under Furietti's supervision. Charles de Brosses saw them displayed in Monsignor Furietti's apartments in the Palazzo Montecitorio in 1739-40,Charles de Brosses, Lettres d'Italie, noted in Haskell and Penny 1981:178 and Francesco de' Ficoroni described them in Furietti's collection in 1744.Ficoroni, Le singolarit√† di Roma moderna 1744:64, noted by Haskell and Penny 1981: Furietti habitually employed Bartolomeo Cavaceppi as a restorer, hence some of the pieces that had passed through Cavaceppi's studio were illustrated from Furietti's former collection in Cavaceppi's self-promoting volume of plates, Raccolta d'antiche statue, busti, teste cognite ed altre sculpture antiche, 1768. The \\"Dove Basin\\", attributed by Furietti to Sosius/Sosos (Capitoline Museums). Among the mosaics he found at Hadrian's Villa is the celebrated one of four doves drinking, found in 1737; Furietti was convinced that it was the very work executed by Sosius/Sosos at Pergamum, mentioned by Pliny the Elder (Pliny's Natural History XXXVI,.25). It was the first plate in his book on mosaics, De Musivis (Rome, 1752), with six engraved plates, four of them folding, which became a classic on the subject.Furietti, De Musivis, vel pictoriae mosaicae artis originis; Moroni 1744. After Furietti's death, his heirs sold the two centaurs and the mosaic for 14,000 scudi,Moroni 1744. for the Museo Clementino. Furietti was also a bibliophile. He edited and published the works of two of his compatriots, Gasparino and Guiniforti Barziza,Gasparini Barzizii Bergomatis et Guiniforti filii Opera, quorum pleraque ex mss. nunc primum in lucem eruta recensuit, ac edidit Joseph Alexander Furiettus Bergomas, (Rome: G.M. Salvioni) 1713, doubtless in collaboration with his uncle. and the poems of Publio Fontana, prefacing the volumes with brief vite. His personal library he bequeathed to his native Bergamo, with the obligation that it be open to the citizens. It became the nucleus of the Biblioteca Civica Angelo Mai;Named for a later scholar, Angelo Mai there some of Furietti's correspondence is preserved.Biblioteca Angelo Mai: calendaer of Furietti papers . His tomb is in the Roman church of the Bergamaschi, Santi Bartolomeo ed Alessandro dei Bergamaschi, also called Santa Maria della Piet√†. The early biography is G.

The investigative adventure that takes place on the island of Dead Reefs off the coast of England, infamous for the wicked pirate inhabitants and a frightful curse. Plot It is said that for hundreds of years, pirates from the English island of Dead Reefs were looting the ships sailing by and slaughtering their crews. One of the wrecked ships was carrying an old relic, kept secret and locked by a centennial monk order. It is known to have been then stolen and retrieved by the ruler of the island, Baron DeSantra. Shortly after, inhabitants of the island started dying in unnatural ways one by one. The first victim of this strange series of events was the Baron's wife, who was killed by her husband with his sword. Ten decades after these alleged \\"facts\\", a new death is reminiscent of the legend and casts fear on the island of Dead Reefs. A detective from the mainland, Amadeo Finvinerro, is sent to investigate the death and find the killer. You are this detective. And you will need more than natural skills to shed the light on this terrific case. Production The island of Dead Reefs is not based on some pre-existing island in real life. Streko-Graphics handled all the scripts and voice recordings, whereas the publisher recruited the voice actors of the roles. The game was written using the Virtools 3D platform. Evgeniy Lebed was the lead developer. The game had 16 characters, over 40 minutes of high-quality cuts and atmospheric music. A demo was released 20 July 2007, and premiered at E3. The game was first published by DreamCatcher in the United States, and afterwards by New Disk in Russia. Atari France distributed the games in France. A fan-made Czech localisation of the game was made in 2008. The game was included in a 2014 Humble Bundle. Streko-Graphics would retroactively say that game had a subpar management, which they only realised late in the production process. It puts this down to the game having a less favourable reception than anticipated. The game had a planned release on Xbox, but the team did not realise how much work it would take to make a separate version of their game.  Critical reception  Streko-Graphics believes that the game had a \\"mediocre\\" reception in the West and in Russia.

In a simple way, every poset P = (X,‚â§) is (isomorphic to) an inclusion order (just as every group is isomorphic to a permutation group ‚Äì see Cayley's theorem). To see this, associate to each element x of X the set : X_{\\\\leq(x)} = \\\\\\\\{ y \\\\in X \\\\mid y \\\\leq x\\\\\\\\} ; then the transitivity of ‚â§ ensures that for all a and b in X, we have : X_{\\\\leq(a)} \\\\subseteq X_{\\\\leq(b)} \\\\text{ precisely when } a \\\\leq b . There can be sets S of cardinality less than |Xsuch that P is isomorphic to the inclusion order on S. The size of the smallest possible S is called the 2-dimension of P. Several important classes of poset arise as inclusion orders for some natural collections, like the Boolean lattice Qn, which is the collection of all 2n subsets of an n-element set, the interval-containment orders, which are precisely the orders of order dimension at most two, and the dimension-n orders, which are the containment orders on collections of n-boxes anchored at the origin.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Susan Isaacs. The original music score was composed by Michael Kamen. Plot In the present (1992), elderly Linda Voss (Melanie Griffith) is interviewed by a BBC documentary team about her experiences before and during World War II. She explains that, growing up in New York City as a young woman of Irish/German Jewish parentage, she always dreamed of visiting Berlin and finding her family members there. In 1940, Linda applies for a job as a secretary with a major law firm, but is rejected because she did not graduate from a prestigious women's college. As she leaves, however, Linda impresses the supervisor by demonstrating that she speaks fluent German, and she is hired as a translator for Ed Leland (Michael Douglas), a humorless attorney. She soon becomes suspicious of his strange behavior and mysterious whereabouts, and begins to suspect that he is actually a spy, and they eventually become lovers. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, when America joins the war with the Allies, Ed emerges as a colonel in the OSS. Linda accompanies him to Washington D.C., but he is suddenly posted away, leaving her alone and devastated. Assigned to work in the War Department, she hears nothing of Ed until one evening in a night club, when he reappears with an attractive female officer. Reluctant to resume their affair, he does re-employ her. Ed and his colleagues need to replace a murdered agent in Berlin on very short notice. Despite knowing little about intelligence work, Linda volunteers and Ed is persuaded by her fluent German and passion to contribute to the war effort. Her mission is to bring back data on the V-1 flying bomb. Ed and Linda travel to Switzerland, where he hands her over to master spy Konrad Friedrichs (John Gielgud), who takes her by train across the border into Germany, to Berlin, where he hides her in his house and introduces her to his niece, Margrete von Eberstein (Joely Richardson), a socialite also working as an Allied agent. Linda assumes the identity of Lina Albrecht, and is planted as a cook in the household of Horst Drescher, a social-climbing Nazi officer, before an important party he is throwing, but she arrives too late to prepare the food properly, causing the dinner to be a disaster, and Drescher angrily fires her. Walking dejectedly on the dark street, alone, after curfew, Linda chances to encounter a guest from the dinner, officer Franz-Otto Dietrich (Liam Neeson), who is charmed by her and mistakenly assumes she must already have had a security check. Dietrich is a widower and takes Linda/\\"Lina\\" on as a nanny to his two children. Between her duties as a servant, she searches Dietrich's house for confidential papers on the V1, which he is also working on. She intends to photograph them, but can find nothing. Meanwhile, Ed, sick with worry about Linda since her disappearance from Drescher's party, suddenly chances to see her in a newsreel of Hitler in a parade in Berlin. Ed's agents identify Dietrich as the man standing next to Linda in the film, and Ed heads to Germany to rescue her. Because he does not speak German, he assumes the identity of a wounded high-ranking German officer, who has had his throat injured and cannot speak. He tracks down Linda and tells her she must leave with him immediately, but Linda reveals that she has located her Jewish cousins, excitedly telling Ed and Margrete how nearby they are. She demands Ed give her another day to visit them and give them hope. The next day, with the children in her care, Linda tracks down her relatives' hiding place in the city, but she finds it empty and ransacked, they have just been captured. When an allied air raid suddenly hits, Linda has to run for cover with the children and protect them, and when they get back to the house, the frightened boy inadvertently reveals the existence of a hidden room in Dietrich's basement. Linda sneaks down there that night and finds and surreptitiously photographs Dietrich's top secret V-1 rocket blueprints. Dietrich has fallen in love with Linda, and invites her to the opera. While there, Linda's cover is blown when Margrete's mother recognizes her, believing Linda to be a friend of her daughter's from college. Dietrich is heartbroken and, once back at his house, Linda sees him loading his gun. Fearing for her life, Linda flees across the city, still in her ballgown, and finds sanctuary with Margrete. When Margrete thinks Linda is not looking, she uses the phone to report in to her superiors, but Linda catches her. Margrete reveals that she is a double agent, who betrayed the agent Linda replaced, causing his death, and that she gave away the location of Linda's Jewish cousins to the Gestapo. Margrete shoots Linda, wounding her, but they struggle and Linda overpowers Margrete and kills her. Linda hides in the laundry chute, escaping the German forces who raid Margrete's apartment. Badly wounded, Linda is found by Ed and Friedrichs, who take her to the railway station. Ed and Linda travel to the Swiss-German border. Linda is unconscious from blood loss, barely alive, and Ed's travel papers have expired. Ed's mute act fails to sway the border guards, forcing him to shoot his way out. Carrying Linda, he struggles towards the border. The German sniper guarding it shoots and wounds him twice, but he gets himself and Linda across before collapsing. Back in the present, Linda reveals that while she and Ed recovered from their injuries in a Swiss hospital, the microfilm of the secret German documents was retrieved from a hiding place inside her glove, and the Allies successfully bombed the V1 installation.

It was to be written and directed by Seltzer, produced at Columbia Pictures and would likely star Debra Winger. By late 1989, just after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Seltzer and producer Rosenman were reported to be scouting potential locations in East Berlin, Warsaw, Krakow, and Budapest, and Meg Ryan and Michelle Pheiffer were reported to be top contenders for the lead role. The production moved soon after to Twentieth Century Fox, and in February 1990, it was announced that Melanie Griffith had been cast. After permission was secured to shoot the film on location in East Germany, the majority of it was shot in Berlin and Potsdam starting in October 1990, just as Germany was being reunified. Studio work was done at the DEFA Studios, the state film studios of East Germany. Because all of Berlin's great train stations were destroyed in World War II, the production traveled over 100 miles to Leipzig at the end of October to shoot scenes in the Leipzig Hauptbahnhof terminus, built in 1915 and the largest in Europe. This was prior to the building's modernization by the Deutsche Bahn. The finale, set at a border crossing and involving a period train, was shot in Klagenfurt, Austria in November, 1990. The New York City and Washington scenes at the beginning of the film were shot in and around London and at nearby Pinewood Studios. Locations included the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Hammersmith, and St Pancras Station, which doubled for Zurich Station for a brief sequence set in Switzerland. Reception The film was neither a commercial nor a critical success. The Razzie Awards declared Shining Through the Worst Picture of 1992, with Melanie Griffith being voted Worst Actress (also for her performance in A Stranger Among Us) and David Seltzer for Worst Director. It also received nominations for Michael Douglas as Worst Actor (also for Basic Instinct) and for Seltzer in the category of Worst Screenplay. The film holds a 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"B+\\" on scale of A+ to F. Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, \\"I know it's only a movie, and so perhaps I should be willing to suspend my disbelief, but Shining Through is such an insult to the intelligence that I wasn't able to do that. Here is a film in which scene after scene is so implausible that the movie kept pushing me outside and making me ask how the key scenes could possibly be taken seriously.\\" Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times that the first three-quarters of Susan Isaacs' book \\"never made it to the screen,\\" including Linda Voss's love affair and marriage to her New York law firm boss, John Berringer. \\"David Seltzer's film version of Shining Through manages to lose also the humor of Susan Isaacs' savvy novel. Even stranger than that is the film's insistence on jettisoning the most enjoyable parts of the story.\\" The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

The municipality borders Aktogay District in the north, Bayanaul District, May District, Lebyazhye District in the south, Pavlodar District in the west, and city of Ekibastuz in the east. Population of the municipality: Population of the town:  History  History of Yermak is related to discovery of coal deposits in the vicinity of Ekibastuz. In 1897, construction of a 110 km railroad from Ekibastuz commenced. The Voskresensk railroad crossed the area of the future town. A wharf was erected where the railroad reached the Irtysh River, and two settlements appeared: an administrative settlement and a workers settlement. The newcomers had to build their houses using local materials: clay, reed and thatch. In this way, at the turn of the 20th century a small village made of wattle-and-daub houses arose close to Kazakh Aul No. 5 in the Kyzyl-Shyrpy Stow. The village was known under the name of Glinka (from Russian '–≥–ª–∏–Ω–∫–∞' ‚Äì clay). The population of Glinka gradually increased, most intensively after the riots of 1906, when out-migrants poured into the Kazakh and Siberian steppe. In 1911, the population of the workers settlement reached 1000. In 1913, by an order of the Governor of the Steppe Krai, Glinka was renamed as Yermak in memory of Yermak Timofeyevich, the 16th-century Russian conqueror of Western Siberia. Both the Voskresensk Wharf and the Glinka village became parts of what was now called the Yermak settlement. 1917 brought new administration to Yermak. The first kommissar of the Ekibastuz Soviet, Stepan Tsaryov was murdered by rioters in Yermak, in the railway station square. The Soviet power was firmly established in Yermak in November 1919, following the creation of the Pavlodar Soviet of People's Commissars. Until 1922, Yermak was a volost centre of the Pavlodar Uezd. According to the census, Yermak had 1289 inhabitants. In 1938, Kaganovich District was formed with its capital in Yermak. Decree of the Praesidium of the Supreme Soviet of Kazakh SSR dated October 23, 1961, granted the Yermak settlement the status of a town. In the 1960s, Yermak became the starting point of the Irtysh‚ÄìKaraganda Canal, which takes water from one of the branches of the Irtysh at , By Decree No. TN 2189-–•–ü of the Praesidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated May 4, 1993, the town of Yermak was renamed the city of Aksu.  Industries  Aksu today is an agroindustrial municipality in Pavlodar Region. Municipality population is about 70.000, including over 29.000 of rural population. The local economic mainstay is represented by the Aksu Ferroalloys Plant and a power plant owned by OJSC Eurasian Power Corporation. Construction of a coal-fired electric power plant commenced in 1960; its first CEO was Vladimir Novik. The first 300MW unit was commissioned on December 17, 1968. In December 1996, the enterprise was restructured into an open joint stock company, Eurasian Power Corporation (–û–ê–û –ï–≤—Ä–æ–∞–∑–∏–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∫–æ—Ä–ø–æ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è). Construction of the facilities of the ferroalloys plant started in 1962. In January 1968, the first ton of ferroalloys was produced at the plant, and in July 1970, eight furnaces were commissioned in Workshop No. 2. The first CEO of the Yermak Ferroalloys Plant was Pyotr Topilsky. In 1995, the enterprise merged into the Kazkhrom Transnational Company. 6 religious associations operate in Aqsu, including a mosque, an orthodox church, Seventh- Day Adventists church, Evangelical Christian Baptists congregation. 50 educational institutions ‚Äì 27 schools, vocational school No. 3, vocational school No. 19, Kazakh language upper secondary school, school-licee, and 11 elementary ungraded schools; 3 out-of-school institutions: Children's Creativity Center, art school, and young naturalists senter; 6 day care centers; Zhayau Musa College; a branch of Pavlodar private university.

The artistic mission of Tulsa Ballet is \\"To preserve the tradition of classical ballet, promote the appreciation of contemporary dance, create works of superior and enduring quality, and educate through exemplary performances, training and outreach programs.\\" The Company has toured throughout the United States and the world and has received consistent critical acclaim. History The company was founded in 1956 by musician Rosalie Talbot and married couple Roman JasinskiJasinsky, Roman (1907‚Äì1991) Australia Dancing and Moscelyne Larkin. Jasinski and Larkin were famous dancers who were internationally known for their style in the grand Ballets Russes tradition. Under their leadership, the troupe rose to the top echelon in the National Association for Regional Ballet in 1973 and became a fully professional company in 1978. After a successful engagement at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College in 1983, a 1986 West Coast tour, and a return to BCBC in 1988 to perform George Balanchine's reconstructed Mozart's Violin Concerto, the company was hailed as one of Oklahoma's valuable arts organizations. In 1990 Roman Larkin Jasinski was appointed to succeed his parents as artistic director of the company. Unfortunately, the company did not thrive under his leadership and at the end of Jasinski's third season, the company began imploding as major conflicts among board members, dancers and the management came to a head. In November 1994, Jasinski tendered his resignation and left the company in chaos. Artistic director Renowned Italian dancer Marcello Angelini was appointed Artistic Director of the Tulsa Ballet in 1995. According to Dance Magazine, Angelini managed to solve the internal conflicts within the company and raise the artistic achievements of the company simultaneously. He unified the board members, working well with artistic director emerita Larkin, and establishing friendly relationships with his predecessors. \\"His gracious yet fierce tenacity, tough professional reputation, and superior negotiating skills soon earned him the nickname 'The Italian Tornado'.\\" Dance Magazine credits Angelini with building a strong and highly versatile company that is able to tackle both classical and contemporary works by well-known choreographers. The Italian-born, Kiev Institute-trained director is said to expect dancers to achieve a technical level and artistic range comparable to that of the major companies he danced with (Deutsche Oper Berlin, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, Cincinnati Ballet, Ballet West). He is also credited with stating that \\"to grow a company, you have to stretch the dancer one way, then the other\\". Productions Tulsa ballet creates five productions annually in addition to The Nutcracker and reaches an audience of over 48,000 individuals every season. Under Angelini's leadership, the company has undertaken an ambitious repertory building program. For the past eleven years, Tulsa Ballet has added more than 60 new works to its repertory, many of which have been either American Premieres or World Premieres. Many of the world's best choreographers have worked with Tulsa Ballet including: Leonide Massine, Antony Tudor, Jerome Robbins, George Balanchine, Paul Taylor, Kurt Jooss, John Butler, Nacho Duato (ten works), Val Caniparoli who is its resident choreographer (with seven works and four world premieres), Stanton Welch, Luciano Cannito, Young Soon Hue, Ma Cong, Lila York, Twyla Tharp and many others. In its first international tour in 2002, Tulsa Ballet was declared by the Portuguese national magazine Semanario ‚ÄúOne of the best in the world.‚Äù The company has received two feature articles in Dance Magazine during the past seven years, has been featured in the New York Times, Pointe Magazine and Dance Europe among others. In March 2008, Tulsa Ballet was featured on the cover of Pointe magazine- a distinction given to only one ballet company each year. In April 2008, Tulsa Ballet completed an ambitious $17.3 million integrated campaign, which was celebrated at the opening of the brand new Studio K; an on-site, three hundred-seat performance space dedicated to the creation of new works.

It aims to contribute to the restoration of consumer confidence in the safety of the European food chain, to protect the consumer from foodborne illness, and to refine risk analysis practices for food safety via an interdisciplinary approach. The full title of the project is \\"SAFE FOODS - Promoting a new, Integrated Risk Analysis Approach for Foods\\". The project is funded by the European Union (EU) Directorate-General for Research (European Commission) via the Sixth Framework Programme, under the ‚ÄòQuality and Safety of Food‚Äô Priority Area. SAFE FOODS is also a founding member of COMMNET, a communication managers' network of several Sixth Framework projects dealing with food quality and safety issues. More than 95 natural and social scientists are involved in the project, coming from 37 institutions in 21 countries.  Thematic research areas  A broad range of research disciplines are used in the SAFE FOODS project, including molecular biology, microbiology, toxicology, probabilistic modeling, and disciplines of the social sciences and the political sciences. SAFE FOODS is divided in 5 sub-projects, namely * Comparative safety evaluation of plant breeding approaches and production practices, * Early detection of emerging food and feed risks, * Quantitative risk assessment of combined exposure to food contaminants and natural toxins, * Consumer research of food risk management perceptions, and * Institutional challenges and solutions to systemic risk management.  Background  The governance of food safety has long been regarded as the domain of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù and professional risk managers, with minimal input from other interested parties such as consumers. However, a number of food safety incidents in Europe, related to, for example, genetically modified organisms, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and dioxins, have severely damaged public trust in food safety regulation and management. This exposed a need for improvement in the current approach to food risk analysis. The SAFE FOODS project has been funded by the EU to develop a new approach in food risk analysis, integrating risk-benefit assessment of human health, consumer preferences and values, as well as impact analysis of socio-economical aspects. Compared to current frameworks, a lot of attention is given to active stakeholder (corporate) participation, increased transparency (humanities) in decision-making, improved interaction between risk assessors and risk managers and more effective communication throughout the risk analysis process.

Born in Milan into an aristocratic family, as a young man he participated in the Accademia dei Pugni, founded together with his brother Pietro Verri and their friends Cesare Beccaria, Alfonso Longo, Pietro Secchi, Giambattista Biffi and Luigi Lambertenghi. Later he collaborated in the magazine Il Caff√®. In this period he wrote the Saggio sulla Storia d'Italia (\\"Essay on Italian History\\", 1761‚Äì1766). Background Subsequently Verri moved to Rome where his main attention moved to theatre. He was one of the first Italian translators of Shakespeare. He wrote two tragedies: Pantea and La congiura di Milano (\\"The Conjure of Milan\\"), both published in 1779. In 1782 he wrote the novel Le avventure di Saffo poetessa di Mitilene (\\"The adventures of Sappho, poet of Mitilene\\"), but his most famous work is the Notti romane al sepolcro degli Scipioni (\\"Roman Nights at the Scipiones' Sepulchre\\"), published in two parts in 1792 and 1804, in which the ghosts of illustrious men of the past (Cicero, Caesar and others) evoke the ancient Roman civilizations, stressing its violent background in contrast with the peaceful Christian civilization. A third part remained unpublished until 1967. His other works include a translation of Daphne and Chloe (1812), the novel La vita di Erostrato (\\"Life of Herostratus\\", 1815) and Vicende memorabili de' suoi tempi dal 1789 al 1801 (\\"Memorable happenings of His Times from 1789 to 1801\\", 1858). Also notable is his correspondence with his brother Pietro. Verri died in Rome in 1816.dal 1792.

The school was founded in 1957. In 1963, the enrollment increased and this forced the school to be divided into two sessions. Both the morning and afternoon session are administered separately by different principals and have different teachers. The two-session schools are officially known as Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan (1) Simpang Lima, Klang and Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan (2) Simpang Lima, Klang and they changed sessions with one another every other year. The original school block was designed with the main two storey block facing a huge sports field (behind Sekolah Tengku Ampuan Rahimah), with a driveway and foyer under the administration office. The block had a covered walkway surrounding an internal square with two badminton courts. The courts also doubled as the student assembly point. In the 1970s, there are three classes for each academic year. Based on the colours of traffic lights, they are Hijau (Green), Kuning (Yellow) and Merah (Red). Originally an all-boys primary school, Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan (2) Simpang Lima finally became co-ed when two girls (Ms Sheila Devi Harikrishnan and Ms Norabani bt Ab Rashid) were admitted for Standard 5 in 1981.

Biography She was born into a musical family in Chicago, Illinois, where she began her concert career at the age of seven. After completing her university and graduate studies in Chicago and Oberlin, Ohio, she moved to London to co-found the ensemble Trio Sonnerie (with Monica Huggett and Sarah Cunningham), with whom she performed and recorded extensively. Mitzi Meyerson specializes in researching little-known or lost works for the harpsichord, which she then brings to light in recordings. Without exception, these CD documents are received with the highest acclaim, many of them winning international awards and prizes. She recently discovered the lost collection of \\"Chamber Airs for the Violin with Through Bass\\" by Richard Jones,Description at Glossa Music website a composer in London at the time of Handel. The world premiere recording of these works had just been released on the Glossa label. Her previous CD release of the complete solo harpsichord works of Richard Jones is also a world premiere. Ms. Meyerson has released over sixty recordings, all to excellent critical acclaim; notable amongst them are solo albums of Dietrich Buxtehude, Jacques Duphly, \\"Musikalischer Parnassus\\" of Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer, Ordres from the 4th Book of Francois Couperin, \\"Componenti Musicali\\" of Gottlieb Muffat, and the complete works for harpsichord by Richard Jones. Her CD prizes include the \\"Choc\\" award from Monde de la Musique\\", \\"Editor's Choice\\" from Gramophone Magazine, and the Diapason d'Or. Ms Meyerson's recent releases include two double-disc sets of Claude BalbastreBalbastre's Musique de Salon (2004) (Glossa), which, together with the previous recording of Georg B√∂hm harpsichord works were awarded the prestigious Deutsche Schallplatten Kritik prize for the best recordings of the year on an international level.

Prior to the presentation of the id Tech 5-based game Rage in 2011, the engines lacked official designation and as such were simply referred to as the Doom and Quake engines, from the name of the main game series the engines had been developed for. \\"id Tech\\" numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been released as free software under the GNU General Public License, along with the source code to Wolfenstein 3D, Doom (id Tech 1), and Quake (id Tech 2). id Tech 7 is currently the latest utilized engine. According to Eurogamer.net, \\"id Software has been synonymous with PC game engines since the concept of a detached game engine was first popularised.\\" However id Tech 4 had far fewer licensees than the Unreal Engine from Epic Games, and id planned to regain the momentum with id Tech 5, until they were bought by ZeniMax Media which intends to keep the id Tech engines exclusively for id's sister studios. Predecessors id Software had developed 3D engines for several games before Doom. Each engine had progressively more advanced 3D technology. * Hovertank 3D (1991) used solid-color drawn polygonal walls and scalable sprites. * Catacomb 3-D (1991) added texture mapping to the walls. * Wolfenstein 3D (1992) increased the color palette from 16-color EGA to 256-color VGA and also adopted raycasting. The game engine was also licensed out to other companies. * ShadowCaster (1993) features diminished lighting, texture mapped floors and ceilings, walls with variable heights, and sloped floors. id Tech 1 Originally known as the \\"Doom engine\\", this engine powers the id Software games Doom (1993) and Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994). It was created by John Carmack, with auxiliary functions written by John Romero, Dave Taylor, and Paul Radek. Initially developed on NeXT computers, it was ported to MS-DOS for Doom's release and was later ported to several game consoles and operating systems. The code was also reused for other titles, such as Heretic and Hexen: Beyond Heretic (both by Raven Software), and Strife: Quest for the Sigil (Rogue Entertainment). id Tech 2 Previously known as \\"Quake engine\\" with its successor \\"Quake II engine\\", it was originally written to power 1996's Quake. It featured true 3D real-time rendering and is the first id Tech engine to use the client‚Äìserver model. The Quake engine was updated with a new executable titled QuakeWorld that contained code to enhance the networking capabilities of Quake in response to the demand for across-internet network games that arose as a result of Quakes usage of UDP for networking. It was later updated again for the release of Quake II in 1997, with enhancements such as colored lighting and a new MD2 model format. By way of Half-Life, it was also adapted into the GoldSrc engine and its successors, the Source engine and Source 2. id Tech 3 Previously known as the \\"Quake III Arena engine\\", it was used to power id Software's Quake III Arena in 1999. The Quake III Arena engine was updated to patch 1.26 and later versions are called \\"Quake III Team Arena engine\\" with a new MD4 skeletal model format and huge outdoor areas. It was updated again with the 2001 release of Return To Castle Wolfenstein which included a single- player scripting system, and was eventually used to power the first Call of Duty title in 2003, ultimately spawning the IW engine. id Tech 4 Commonly known as the \\"Doom 3 engine\\" which was used to power Doom 3 as it released in 2004, id Tech 4 began as an enhancement to id Tech 3. During development, it was initially just a complete rewrite of the engine's renderer, while still retaining other subsystems, such as file access, and memory management. The decision to switch from C to the C++ programming language necessitated a restructuring and rewrite of the rest of the engine; today, while id Tech 4 contains code from id Tech 3, much of it has been rewritten. Other games using this engine were Raven Software's Quake 4 (2005) and Wolfenstein (2009), Human Head Studios' Prey (2006), Splash Damage's Enemy Territory: Quake Wars (2007) and Brink (2011). id Tech 5 Used for id Software's Rage, the engine is based on the file system frameworks. Some technologies included are the GUI system from id Tech 4, including a new renderer, MegaTexture 2.0 technology, soft shadows and more. id is requiring companies that use the engine to publish their games through id's sister company, Bethesda Softworks. The engine has since been used to power MachineGames' first two Wolfenstein titles; The New Order in 2014 with its standalone expansion The Old Blood, which released in 2015. It was also used for Tango Gameworks' The Evil Within (2014). id Tech 6 Used for the Doom reboot released on May 13, 2016. While the engine uses some of the features from id Tech 5, id has also added support for Vulkan rendering. Development of the renderer is led by Tiago Sousa, who had previously worked on CryEngine, following previous technical director John Carmack's resignation in 2013. id Tech 6 was also used in Wolfenstein: Youngblood (2019) and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus (2017), again by MachineGames. It was not used for Quake Champions however, which combined id Tech features with the Saber3D Engine. id Tech 7 The latest release of id tech released alongside Doom Eternal on March 20, 2020. At QuakeCon 2018 id Software announced a new game in the Doom franchise called Doom Eternal which is powered by the id Tech 7 engine. The company promises that the new engine is capable of delivering a 10-times increase in geometric detail vs. id Tech 6. On PC, id Tech 7 will support Vulkan rendering only.

This evolutionary view of religious development is diametrically opposed to another evolutionary view of religion: the hypothesis that religion progressed from simple forms to complex: first pre-animism, then animism, totemism, polytheism and finally monotheism (see Anthropology of religion). History Scottish anthropologist Andrew Lang concluded in 1898 that the idea of the Supreme Being, the \\"high God\\" or \\"All Father\\" existed among some of the simplest of contemporary tribes prior to Western contact, and that Urmonotheism (primitive monotheism or henotheism) that worshipped God, as opposed to a pantheon of polytheistic gods, was the original religion of mankind. Urmonotheism was then defended by Wilhelm Schmidt (1868‚Äì1954), in his Der Ursprung der Gottesidee appearing from 1912, opposing the \\"Revolutionary Monotheism\\" approach that traces the emergence of monotheistic thought as a gradual process spanning the Bronze and Iron Age Religions of the Ancient Near East and Classical Antiquity. Alleged traces of primitive monotheism were located in the Assyrian deities Ashur and Marduk, and Hebrew YHWH. Monotheism in Schmidt's view is the \\"natural\\" form of theism, which was later overlaid and \\"degraded\\" by polytheism after deceased ancestors' veneration became worship, and personified natural forces became worshipped as well as gods. Schmidt's hypothesis was controversially discussed during much of the first half of the 20th century. In the 1930s, Schmidt adduced evidence from Native American mythology, Australian aborigines and other primitive civilizations in support of his views.High Gods in North America, 1933The Origin and Growth of Religion: Facts and Theories, 1931 He also responded to his critics. For instance, he rejected Rafael Pettazzoni's claim that the sky gods were merely a dim personification or embodiment of the physical sky, writing in The Origin and Growth of Religion: \\"The outlines of the Supreme Being become dim only among later peoples\\".Schmidt, The Origin and Growth of Religion: Facts and Theories, New York: Cooper Square Publishers, 1972, page 211 He adds that \\"a being who lives in the sky, who stands behind the celestial phenomena, who must 'centralize' in himself the various manifestations [of thunder, rain, etc.] is not a personification of the sky at all\\". According to Ernest Brandewie in Wilhelm Schmidt and the Origin of the Idea of God, Schmidt also claims that Pettazzoni fails to study Schmidt's work seriously and often relies on incorrect translations of Schmidt's German.Brandewie, Wilhelm Schmidt and the Origin of the Idea of God, Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 1983, page 251 Brandewie also says Pettazzoni's definition of primitive ethical monotheism is an \\"arbitrary\\" straw-man argument, but he says Schmidt went too far when he claimed that such ethical monotheism was the earliest religious idea.Brandewie, pages 44 and 119 By the 1950s the academic establishment had rejected the hypothesis of primitive ethical monotheism (but not per se other proposed versions of urmonotheism) so the proponents of Schmidt's \\"Vienna school\\" rephrased his ideas to the effect that while ancient cultures may not have known \\"true monotheism\\", they at least show evidence for \\"original theism\\" (Ur-Theismus, as opposed to non-theistic animism), with a concept of Hochgott (\\"High God\\", as opposed to Eingott \\"Single God\\") in effect henotheism which acknowledged the Supreme Being but also various lesser gods. Christian apologetics in the light of this have moved away from postulating a \\"memory of revelation\\" in pre-Christian religions, replacing it with an \\"inkling of redemption\\" or virtuous paganism unconsciously anticipating monotheism. That said, E. E. Evans-Pritchard noted in Theories of Primitive Religion, first published in 1962, that most anthropologists have abandoned all evolutionary schemes like Schmidt and Pettazzoni's for the historical development of religion, adding that they have also found monotheistic beliefs existing side-by-side with other religious beliefs.Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard, Theories of Primitive Religion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1987, pages 104‚Äì105 See also * Fitra * Hanif * Prehistoric religion Notes Category:Monotheism Category:Anthropology of religion ","title":"Urmonotheismus"},{"id":"11728427","text":"A marlock or moort is a shrubby or small-tree form of Eucalyptus found in Western Australia.

Background Run by two DJs [Jason] Rudeboy (who pioneered one of the earliest underground music nights at Commerce Club, the infamous Class War free raves and then went on to run the BBoy Discotheque experimenting in the original sounds of rap) and Hot Rod (a long-time announcer on a radio show called Tronik Voodoo Exorcism on 3PBS-FM also known as Mad Rod), the night reflected the cutting edge of global styles in techno and club music. Borrowing heavily from the gay scene, they lent towards the obscure and taboo Performing Arts. The club always regularly had shows and live performances from electro poets to male strippers and drag shows. Early on pursuing a more acid house sound, pre-nascent hardcore techno and drum & bass, then filtering across into the sounds of Detroit, Chicago, New York, Berlin, Cologne, London, Sweden, Scotland, and - of course - Melbourne. Filter's sound also cut across record labels as varied as Djax, Force Inc., Tresor, Relief, Axis, Purpose Maker, Sativae, Mosquito, Nova Mute, Valve, Drumcode, Stayupforever, and Pharma. Dom Phillips, the editor of the UK's Mixmag, visited the club in late 1995 and referred to it in a subsequent article on Melbourne's underground scene thus: \\"Filter is a wicked club, one of those long-running midweek specials that are, somehow, always cool... Some things are international.\\"Underground Melbourne, Dom Phillips. Mixmag, Vol. 2, #58, March 1996. Zebra Magazine, the dance/nightclub music insert in Melbourne's Inpress, wrote in 1997 that \\"Club Filter at the Lounge has virtually established itself as a cultural icon within Melbourne's dance music fraternity.\\" 5 Years & Still Smoking, Justin Case. Inpress, July 1997. In June 2001 the club celebrated its ninth anniversary with a webcast to a dance music site. International and local DJs and live acts International DJs and live acts played a key role in the club's development. Among them were Claude Young, Jammin' Unit, Dave Angel, Colin Dale, Rob Gee, Biochip C, Khan Oral (Bizz OD), Ree.K, Stacey Pullen, Lenny Dee, Space Dj'z, Dave the Drummer and Joey Beltram. But just as importantly, Filter set about supporting and nurturing local live talents and DJs, including Terrence Ho (H20), Steve Law (Zen Paradox), Voiteck, Honeysmack, Andrez Bergen (Little Nobody), Soulenoid, Guyver 3, Liz Millar, Arthur Arkin, Ollie Olsen, Bwana, Scott Alert, DJ Trooper, Nick Dem Q, Ransom, Cara Caama, Lani G, DJ Ides, Dee Dee, Halo Produkshuns, Slieker, Richie Rich (Richard MacNeill), Zanna Mazzitelli, Andrew Till, Eden, Fiery Eye, Dan Woodman, Derek Shiel, Dom Hogan, Toupee, RSK, Miss Krystal, Graham Mono, Juju Space Jazz, Krang, 8-Bit, Ben Shepherd, Katy K, Matt Sykes, Rob Wu, MBug and Blimp. Filter also collaborated regularly with other Melbourne-based labels such as IF? Records, Psy-Harmonics, Smelly Records, and Messy Creations. The success of the night lay mainly in the fact that it was able to regenerate itself constantly as the music worldwide did. Often criticized for bringing to the 'scene' trends in music too early, this inevitably helped the club to continue its long reign for over 11 years. The new music was enjoyed by people, of all ages, who were not necessarily into the socially excepted techno that mainstream raves and clubs had to offer, but could now enjoy current world trends before money hungry promoters waited until it was commercially viable before bringing out acts or style jumping to gain credibility. It could also be said that the fact it was a mid-week party, that the club never stepped on anyone's toes and was given the free range it needed to explore diverse avenues of entertainment. The club closed by mutual consent in 2003. \\"Earlier this year a blank stare of disbelief swept over Melbourne‚Äôs dance community as news spread that after 11 years and nearly 600 consecutive Wednesdays later, the most enduring club in worldwide electronic music ‚Äì Club Filter - would be closing forever,\\" reported DJ Ides that same year in an online article at Australian music website inthemix.com.au.\\"Club Filter: 11 years of history in Australian dance culture\\" by DJ Ides. inthemix.com.au, 8 June 2003.

Located nearby with The Flagstaff and the Time Ball, the three navigation structures played an essential role during the early maritime history of Singapore. History Fort Canning Hill, with its strategic location overlooking the Singapore Harbour, was used as a communication centre after the British established port here in 1819. The first communication facility built on the hill was a flagstaff. The flagstaff was used to display the arrival, identity, location and status of ships entering Singapore Harbour. This was followed by a time ball, a lighthouse and a telegraph office in later years.National Heritage Board, \\"Fort Canning Hill as a communication centre\\" (On-site information board). Construction Fort Canning Lighthouse was built on the southern side of Fort Canning Hill to guide ships safely towards the Singapore Harbour. The first signal light on Fort Canning was a simple lantern attached to the top of the Flagstaff in 1855. The Flagstaff light was replaced by the Lighthouse in 1903 by Riley, Hargreaves & Co., who in 1909 combined with another company to form United Engineers that is still present to this day at nearby River Valley. The light was created by a burner fuelled by kerosene, which generated 20,000 candlepower and itself was dioptric occulting type. The light was \\"eclipsed\\" (darkened) every 17 seconds by lowering a metal cylinder around the burner for 3 seconds, thus giving rise to the term \\"occulting type\\".National Heritage Board, \\"The Lighthouse\\" (On-site information board). Though the Lighthouse survived the destruction of the Second World War, it was finally closed and dismantled on December 1958, when new tall buildings were making it invisible from the sea. It was replaced by a new signal light using electricity that was erected on top of the Fullerton Building. The Fullerton Light was itself taken down in 1979 and is now in the Maritime Museum of Singapore. The Lighthouse today Due to its historic significance, a replica of the Lighthouse was later erected near its original site by the government of Singapore. Though its lights are fully functional, it no longer serves its original purpose but stands today as a legacy of its contribution to Singapore maritime history.

Bonus points accumulated by Van Praag and Langton took them to the top of the standings and into a run-off (match race).

However, Van Praag stated he did not want to win the title by default and insisted that a race should take place.

The folklore tells about a life of prince in the era of Sunda kingdom when Great King Silihwangi (famous with name Prabu Siliwangi ) reigning in the kingdom. The Sunda Kingdom itself is often called by Sundanese as Pajajaran (the capital city of the kingdom) after Cirebon and Banten separated from it.  Sources  This folklore originates from a Sundanese oral tradition called pantun story, which then transferred into books written by some Sundanese writers, both in Sundanese and Indonesian.  Summary  King Silihwangi from Galuh married Nyimas Tejamantri. They had a son, Prince Guru Gantangan. When Prince Guru Gantangan was teenager, the King married Nyimas Padmawati, a princess from Sunda Kingdom. King Silihwangi then became the king of Sunda Kingdom or Pajajaran. Prince Guru Gantangan was then assigned as a regent in Kutabarang. From Queen Nyimas Padmawati, king Silihwangi has a son called Prince Mundinglaya. Because Prince Guru Gantangan had not any children except an adopted son called Prince Sunten Jaya, he asked Padmawati to look after Prince Mundinglaya. Prince Guru Gantangan also took care of Sunten Jaya. However, Prince Gurugantangan loved his half brother more than his own son, a strange attitude which might have been caused by the difference in character of both princes. Prince Mundinglaya was an elegant, good looking as sweet where his nephew was proud and spoiled. It came not as a surprise when Prince Guru Gantangan's wife tooke care of him carefully. As a consequence, Prince Sunten Jaya became jealous of Prince Mundinglaya. So was the case with Prince Guru Gantangan. Prince Guru Gantangan put Prince Mundinglaya in prison with a reason that Prince Mundinglaya liked teasing a girl at court. This decision made the people and the nobility in Pajajaran took sides and the discord threatened the kingdom to lapse into a quarrel among brothers. At this critical moment something strange happened. One night Queen Nyimas Padmawati, Prince Mundinglaya\\"s mother had a strange dream. She was in her sleep seven \\"guriangs\\", creatures who usually lived in high mountains. They brought with them an amulet, called Layang Salaka Domas. The Queen heard the one who was holding the amulet in his hand, saying to the others: \\"There will be peace in Pajajaran only if a knight dares to featch it from Jabaning Langit\\". As soon as she awoke the next morning, she told the king about it. The king was very interested in the dream and immediately asked all the people as well as the nobility, including Prince Guru Gantangan and Prince Sunten Jaya to gather in front of the palace yard, where he told them about the queen's dream. Afterwards he asked, \\"Is there a knight who is ready to go to Jabaning Langit to fetch the amulet?\\" No one responded. Not even Prince Sunten Jaya raised his voice. He was afraid of facing Jonggrang Kalapitung, a dangerous, forbidding giant who watched over the road. After a moment of silence it was Lengser, the Prime Minister, who raised his voice: \\"Your Majesty,\\" he said, \\"everybody has heard your speaking, but there is still one man who has not. He is in prison. You have not asked him. He is Prince Mundinglaya.\\" Hearing this the king ordered Prince Mundinglaya to be brought into his presence. Lengser then asked permission of Prince Guru Gantangan to release Prince Mundinglaya. When Prince Mundinglaya came into presence, the king spoke: \\"Mundinglaya, would you like to go to fetch the amulet, needed to prevent the country from falling into a catasthrope?\\" Since Layang Salaka Domas is important for the security of Pajajaran, I am willing to go, Father,\\" said Prince Mundinglaya. The king was satisfied with this answer, the people and the nobility were delivered. To prince Mundinglaya this task also meant freedom if he succeeded, while to Prince Sunten Jaya it meant a way of getting rid of his enemy, as he was sure that his uncle would be killed by Jonggrang Kalapitung. \\"Grandfather,\\" he said, \\"he is a prisoner, if you let him go, there would be a guarantee that he returns.\\" \\"What do you propose, Sunten Jaya?\\" \\"If he does not return after one month, put his mother Padmawati into prison in his palace.\\" The people and the nobility were startled on hearing this request. The king turned to Prince Mundinglaya: \\"What do you say about?\\" I shall return in a month time and agree with Sunten Jaya's proposal.\\" Several weeks, Prince Mundinglaya was taught martial arts and how to use weaponry as a preparation to combat obstacles hindering his way to Jabaning Langit. Then Prince Mundinglaya left. As he had never gone to Jabaning Langit, he did not know the way. Leaving it to the guidance of God, he walked through thick forest to find Jabaning Langit and meet guriangs. In his way, he passed Muaraberes (or Tanjung Barat) Kingdom. There he met Dewi Kania or Dewi Kinawati, a Muaraberes' princess, and fell in love with her. Prince Mundinglaya promised to meet her again after he has finished his duty to have Layang Salaka Domas. Prince Mundinglaya continued his way. Suddenly he was awakened by the presence of the Jonggrang Kalapitung who was standing in front of him. \\"Why did you enter my domain? Do you present yourself to be my meal?\\" \\"Just try me!\\" the Prince answered calmly. Jonggrang Kalapitung immediately fell upon him but the Prince evaded him. Time after time the giant tried to attack Prince Mundinglaya, but again he fell to the ground till at last he was out of breath. With the creese in his hand the Prince threatened the enemy: \\"Tell me where is Jabaning Langit?\\" \\"In your body.\\" Thinking that he was betrayed, Prince Mundinglaya pressed the creese deeper into the giant's neck. \\"Do not lie! Where is Jabaning Langit?\\" \\"In your own heart.\\" Then the Prince let the giant loose, saying: \\"I let you free, but do not trouble the people from Pajajaran any longer.\\" At this the giant thanked and left the Pajajaran wood forever. When he was gone, Prince Mundinglaya found out a place for meditation, prayed very long, asking God for advice. One day, he felt as if he were dreaming. He was lifted from his place and flown to a place which was shining brightly. There he was received by seven \\"guriangs\\" (supernatural creatures), one of whom was holding Layang Salaka Domas. They asked him why he dared to come there. \\"My purpose is to fetch the Layang Salaka Domas needed for my country as a remedy for a quarrel between brothers. A lot of people will suffer and die for nothing.\\" \\"We appreciate you, Prince Mundinglaya, but we cannot give you Layang Salaka Domas as it is not for men. What about another present which we can give to you? A princess for example or wealth, or making you the most holy man in the world?\\" \\"I do not need all those, if the people of Pajajaran were engaged in war.\\" \\"In that case, you should take it from us by force.\\" A fight followed. As the \\"guriangs\\" were to strong, Prince Mundinglaya fell down, dead. Immediately another magical creature, Nyi Pohaci appeared at the place where the \\"guriangs\\" were standing around Prince Mundinglaya's lifeless body. She made him alive again and soon he was ready to fight the guriangs. \\"It is no longer necessary, since you have shown your real character,\\" one of them said, \\"honest, unselfish. You have the right to keep the Layang Salaka Domas.\\" And he handed it to him. Prince Mundinglaya was very glad and thanked them. He also thanked Nyi Pohaci for her help. Then he left for Pajajaran escorted by the seven \\"guriangs\\" who then called themselves as one group: Gumarang tunggal. In Pajajaran, Prince Sunten Jaya teased Prince Mundinglaya's mother. To the king he said that Queen Nyimas Padmawati did not really dream, that she had lied to free her son from prison. Therefore, he urged his grandfather to condemn the unlucky queen to death. Prince Sunten Jaya even tried to overpower Dewi Kinawati in Muara Beres by telling her that Prince Mundinglaya had already been devoured by Jonggrang Kalapitung. People shouldered arms and attacked the kingdom. At the critical moment Prince Mundinglaya and his guards arrived in Muaraberes. The crowd cheered. Prince Sunten Jaya and his followers were defeated. After coming back to Pajajaran, King Silihwangi proclaimed Prince Mundinglaya as his successor with the title of king Mundinglaya Di Kusumah. At the same time the new king married Dewi Kinawati and so she became queen. Since then Pajajaran become a peaceful ang prosperous country.

He was appointed governor of Texas by the Spanish viceroy of New Spain in 1767. It is recorded that O'Conor rode well over on horseback in the course of conducting his duties. O'Conor was called \\"The Red Captain\\" by the Apache, both for the color of his hair and his formidable military leadership. O'Conor was the founding father of the city of Tucson, Arizona, having authorized the construction of a military fort in that location in 1775. In 1777, O'Conor requested, due to his failing health, to be transferred to the Yucatan Peninsula, whereupon he was promoted to brigadier general and appointed Governor of Yucatan Peninsula. He served there until his death in 1779.  Biography  O'Connor was born in 1732 in Dublin, Ireland, into the Gaelic-Irish aristocratic O'Conor Don Family. He was a descendant of Turlough M√≥r O'Conor, King of Connacht and High King of Ireland. Because of the Penal Laws which restricted the political, religious and commercial rights of Irish Catholics O'Conor left his homeland and moved to Spain where his cousins Alexander (Alejandro) and Dominic O'Reilly, were serving as officers in the Spanish Royal Army. He was established in Aragon. In his youth he joined the regiment of Volunteers of Aragon, eventually acquiring the title of major. During his years in the military, he was sent to Cuba and Mexico City. There he distinguished himself by his ability as a military strategist and was appointed captain for the Northern Territory to exercise dominion in the region.Casares G.

It was at this time that he obtained the title of inspector general of the Provincias Internas (general inspector of the Interior Provinces). Later, in 1767, he was appointed governor of Texas, in replacement of Martos and Navarrete. When he took office, he found that one of its major cities, San Antonio, was shattered by frequent attacks of several Indian tribes. Therefore, the new governor set up a garrison at Los Adaes to protect the city. In 1771 he became commander of the Chihuahua frontier and on January 20, 1773 he was appointed commandant inspector of presidios under the office of Coronel. He and Governor Juan Mar√≠a Vicencio de Ripperd√° rejected the petition of Antonio Gil Y'Barbo that the settlers could return to their original homes. To strengthen the protection of Nueva Vizcaya, Coahuila, Sonora, Mexico he decided to expel the Apaches in the region, making war against these peoples in 1775 and 1776, killing a large number. The Apaches who survived fled to more western areas. in 1777, he suffered a serious illness and was sent to Yucatan Peninsula, with the title of governor and brigadier general of the Mexican province, which was a lesser charge to that which he usually occupied.

During his term of incarceration, he read widely, both in the Chinese classics and Western anthropology. On his release in 1934, he attended a lecture by the doyen of folklore studies, Yanagita Kunio, where he became acquainted with Oka Masao, who had just returned from completing a degree in ethnology at Vienna University. Through Oka's offices he was introduced to, and married, a granddaughter of Yanagita's older brother. Vexations were not wholly relieved by this advantageous connection. He remained unemployed, and had to suffer monthly visits by police agents who kept him under surveillance. The impasse in his career was overcome when Oka managed to secure for him a scholarship to study abroad at his own alma mater, Vienna University. At the late age of 34, Ishida began following lectures there from March 1937. After Hitler's invasion and annexation of Austria, many of his teachers in ethnology, among them Father Wilhelm Schmidt, the world- famous linguist and anthropologist were forced into exile, and with the outbreak of World War II he himself was repatriated on the last available ship for Japanese nationals sailing from Bordeaux, the Kagoshima-maru. His expertise in ethnography was quickly turned to profitable uses on his return, and he finally received employment as member of a government organization interested in research on folk minorities in East Asia. In 1941, he surveyed the tribes of southern Sakhalin/Karafuto, such as the Gilyak (Nivkhs), the Ainu and the Oroks.

Each redo log file consists of redo records. A redo record, also called a redo entry, holds a group of change vectors, each of which describes or represents a change made to a single block in the database. For example, if a user \`UPDATE\`s a salary- value in a table containing employee-related data, the DBMS generates a redo record containing change-vectors that describe changes to the data segment block for the table. And if the user then \`COMMIT\`s the update, Oracle generates another redo record and assigns the change a \\"system change number\\" (SCN). Whenever something changes in a datafile, Oracle records the change in the redo log. The name redo log indicates its purpose: If the database crashes, the RDBMS can redo (re-process) all changes on datafiles which will take the database data back to the state it was when the last redo record was written. DBAs use the views \`V$LOG\`, \`V$LOGFILE\`, \`V$LOG_HISTORY\` and \`V$THREAD\` to find information about the redo log of the database. Each redo log file belongs to exactly one group (of which at least two must exist). Exactly one of these groups is the CURRENT group (can be queried using the column status of v$log). Oracle uses that current group to write the redo log entries. When the group is full, a log switch occurs, making another group the current one. Each log switch causes checkpoint, however, the converse is not true: a checkpoint does not cause a redo log switch. One can also manually cause a redo-log switch using the \`ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE\` command.  Classification  Redo log files occur in two types: * online redo logs (\\"ORL\\" or \\"redo logs\\" for short) * archived redo logs (\\"archive logs\\")  Usage  Before a user receives a \\"\\" message, the system must first successfully write the new or changed data to a redo log file. The RDBMS first writes all changes included in the transaction into the log buffer in the System Global Area (SGA). Using memory in this way for the initial capture aims to reduce disk IO. Of course, when a transaction commits, the redo log buffer must be flushed to disk, because otherwise the recovery for that commit could not be guaranteed. The LGWR (Log Writer) process does that flushing. Having a redo log makes it possible to replay SQL statements. Before an Oracle database changes data in a datafile it writes changes to the redo log. If something happens to one of the datafiles, a recovery procedure can restore a backed-up datafile and then replay the redo written since backup-time; this brings the datafile to the state it had before it became unavailable. Standby databases in an Oracle Data Guard environment use the same technique: one database (the primary database) records all changes and sends them to the standby database(s). Each standby database applies (replays) the arrived redo, resulting in synchronization with the primary database. If a database crashes, the recovery process has to apply all transactions, both uncommitted as well as committed, to the data-files on disk, using the information in the redo log files. Oracle must re-do all redo-log transactions that have both a \`BEGIN\` and a \`COMMIT\` entry (roll forward), and it must undo all transactions that have a \`BEGIN\` entry but no \`COMMIT\` entry (roll back). (Re-doing a transaction in this context simply means applying the information in the redo log files to the database; the system does not re-run the transaction itself.) The system thus re-creates committed transactions by applying the ‚Äúafter image‚Äù records in the redo log files to the database, and undoes incomplete transactions by using the \\"before image\\" records in the undo tablespace. Change data capture can read the redo logs. In Oracle Data Guard configurations, standby redo logs resemble their equivalent online redo logs, but serve to store redo data transmitted from a different database.  Implications  Given the verbosity of the logging, Oracle Corporation provides methods for archiving redo logs (archive-logs), and this in turn can feed into data-backup scenarios and standby databases. The existence of a detailed series of individually logged transactions and actions provides the basis of several data-management enhancements such as Oracle Flashback, log- mining and point-in-time recovery. The concept of a database incarnation can influence the use of redo in database recovery. For database tuning purposes, efficiently coping with redo logs requires plentiful and fast-access disk.

On the leased machine Willis scored 3 points and finished joint 27th in the Championship. 2000 Development work continued over the winter of 1999 and throughout 2000, and the BSL again entered the 500 championship at selected rounds as a wild card entry. It was another bad year as the bike continued to be problematic and failed to score any points. Mark Willis once more rode for the team, but left when he was offered a ride with Modenas. New Zealand rider Stephen Briggs had a wildcard ride in the Pacific Grand Prix at Motegi but failed to qualify. Although the BSL was granted wildcard status by the F.I.M. to any Grand Prix for the following season, it never raced in the 500 cc class again.

The film was silent and filmed in black and white, and was based on the Banjo Paterson poem of the same name. It is considered a lost film. Plot A country boy, Jim Conroy, is living a dissolute life in the city, running around with vamp Helen Ross. When his father cuts him off, he is dumped by Helen and returns to the bush. Jim works for a corrupt squatter, Stingey Smith, and falls in love with Kitty Carewe, daughter of John Carewe, the squatter next door. John is impressed with Jim's skill with a horse and invites him to train his finest horse, \\"Swagman\\", hoping to win enough prize money to save his farm. A jealous farm hand plots with Smith to fix the race so that the latter can take over the Carewe farm, letting \\"Swagman\\" go and run with the brumbies. However Jim rescues the horse and rides it to victory. Smith frames Jim for theft but he is proved innocent and Jim marries Kitty. Cast *Cyril Mackay as Jim Conroy *Stella Southern as Kitty Carewe *Tal Ordell as Stingey Smith *Hedda Barr as Helen Ross *John Cosgrove as Saltbush Bill *Robert MacKinnon as Dick Smith *John Faulkner as John Carewe *Charles Beetham as Bill Conroy *Dunstan Webb as Ryan *Nan Taylor as Mrs Potts *James Coleman as Trooper Scott *Con Berthal as cook Production Development Beaumont Smith bought the film rights to all the works of Banjo Paterson and spent two years writing a script. The copyright was held by Angus Robertson in entirety but they passed some of the money on to Paterson. Smith incorporated characters from various Paterson works, including squatter's daughter, Kitty Carewe, and swagman, Saltbush Bill. The character of Helen Ross, however, was Smith's original invention. Smith later claimed the price of the film rights was the highest ever that had been paid in Australian cinema, with the exception of The Sentimental Bloke (1919). In January 1919 Snowy Baker announced he would star in the film based on Smith's script. It was reported that \\"a start has already been made with the picture on Mr. Erie McKellar's station, where every facility is offered for the aiming of such thrills as the great ride from \\"Rio Grande,\\" the bushranging scenes from \\"Conroy's Gap,\\" and the tight from \\"Salt Bush Bill.\\" Smith said the film would incorporate matters he had learned in America and would be released via E.J. Carroll. However Baker wound up not appearing in the film. In November 1919 Smith announced he would make the movie in Hollywood, as an attempt to break into the US market. He left in November 1919 but returned to Sydney within six months, bringing back with him a documentary about Hollywood, A Journey through Filmland, which he released in Sydney in February 1921.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 99. In March 1920 he announced he would make the film in Australia. In May 1920 it was reported fIlming was delayed by the unavailability of film stock. Casting Smith used American talent available in Australia, including John K. Wells, who was assisting Wilfred Lucas on the Snowy Baker movies, and visiting actress Hedda Barr. (At one stage it was announced Snowy Baker would star but this did not eventuate.) Cyril Mackay was a stage actor who had retired after suffering a nervous breakdown. He came out of retirement to play the role. The movie marks the film debut of movie star Stella Southern, who was working as a shop girl when discovered by Smith; he gave her the name for this film. \\" ‚ÄúI believe it to be absolutely real,‚Äù said Smith, ‚Äúhonest Australian, without any artificiality, burlesque, or exaggeration of types. There are no bushrangers, there are only true Australian people, and the film is as clear as the air of Kosciusko itself, and I believe the public will like it be cause of this.‚Äù Shooting Shooting began in June 1920 on location at Mulgoa, Wallacia and Luddenham in the Blue Mountains. In order to obtain footage for the climactic race, Smith held a race day and invited horsemen from the local area to participate in four races at Luddenham. Reception Critical Smith's Weekly praised the movie saying it had: > Charming scenery, helped by clever photography and lighting. The story i¬ª > wholesomely exciting, with touches of kindlyhumour. The acting is excellent, > though no great demands are ' made on those concerned...Mr. Smith is wise to > show bush folk inan attractive light, whilst sacrificing nothing of the > Australian atmosphere. Here, at last, is a picture, not only for local > consumption, but one that will be welcomed overseas. Everyone's called the film: > A top-notch Australian production that revives one‚Äôs hopes for the > establishment of a great movie industry in the Commonwealth. Beaumont Smith > shows... what can be done with Australian scenery for backgrounds, and an > Australian poem as the pivot for an interesting plot characterised by quick > action. Thq, personalities of Paterson‚Äôs verses are skilfully interwoven > with a story into which the woman interest \\"is cleverly in troduced... City > and country alike will hail the ‚Äô‚ÄôMan from Snowy River‚Äù scenically, and in > both photographic and acting senses as the best Australian movie yet. Proposed Sequel When Smith finished the film he announced plans for a sequel Clancy of the Overflow. but this was never made.

He has won the Pickup Truck Racing championship a record five times, in the 2003, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2012 seasons.  Racing team  * Robert Quinn * Adam Blundy * Dean Blundy * Kevin Dance * Matt Dance * Charlie Goodwin  Career  Dance has been racing since he was 21 and has worked his way through different formulas winning championships along the way. Initially he began in the Super Rod formula racing with the locally based Spedeworth International racing at Wimbledon and Aldershot. These cars were mainly 3 litre Ford Capris. He built his own cars from scratch with a loyal group of friends. He soon made a name for himself as a respected innovative driver. He travelled from one end of the Country to the other competing for points to qualify for Championships. In 1980 he moved to the 1600cc Hot Rods and for a short period of time he raced both achieving London Champion title in both cars. After this title he became the English Champion in the Hot Rods. In 1989 a new formula was introduced, the Intersaloons. These were similar to the Hot Rods but the engine could be as large as 2 litres. One of the main challenges that Dance was looking forward to in this series was the move from small ovals to circuits. This progression suited Dance's driving skills. He particularly enjoyed racing at Lydden Hill and in 1991 he won the Championship. When in 1994 the Eurocar package was brought in it introduced a whole new concept in racing in this country. It promoted showmanship and family entertainment allowing the spectators access to the pits, the cars and the race teams. The cars were 2900cc Ford Mondeo‚Äôs and as with previous formulas Dance learnt about and then built his own cars. This time it was with added help of his two nephews, Dean and Adam who had been supporting him over the seasons. Due to being involved from a young age they are as skilled as any other mechanics on the circuit. Eurocar racing introduced Dance to more new tracks like Donington, Castle Combe, Mallory Park and Brands Hatch. In his first year, he raced a V6 Eurocar under the Sponsorship of Tulip Computers and came 6th in the Championship. Dance then had to leave the racing to concentrate on his business. After successfully building up a Grab Hire firm he returned to the V6‚Äôs a season or two later and came 4th overall. The season after was his best Season ever, the Team worked consistently hard and achieved good results. Dance won the Eurocar V6 Championship with a meeting in hand, the first time that has been achieved in its 5 years history. In 2002, a new formula came to light and after winning the V6 Championship three times in a row he was after a fresh new challenge. Dance had a test drive around Brands Hatch in a Truck and he enjoyed the experience so much that he got himself a Truck and started competing in the Championship whilst also racing in the V6. The season was a learning curve for him and the Team and they gained valuable information into the running of the Truck and although it was only their first season, they came 7th overall. After such a great start, he decided to leave the V6 Championship and concentrate on the Pickup Trucks. The team decided on a name for them: Draft Racing, a colour scheme for the Pickup, a logo and all of the team clothes. They chose a brand new engine builder and decided to start from scratch and do things right, this proved a sensible idea as after all of the effort and support he won the title in 2003. The Team decided to experiment with the Truck in 2004 after winning the Championship to take the series on further. They learnt new things, good and bad and finished the season 4th. The 2005 season brought new faces and new styles of racing into the formula which upped the tempo of the racing and it made the Drivers want to push their Trucks further. Again he finished the season in 4th position, but he did not give up. The Truck was the best it had ever been but it still wasn‚Äôt good enough. So during the off season, the Truck was taken to different tracks and to its engine builder for progress work and the Team were in a positive frame of mind for the 2006 Season. In 2010, he clinched his third championship title after fending off Pete Stevens by 68 points, and became the second driver to have won the championship three times, the other driver being Gavin Seager. At the 2011 season finale, he won the championship a record fourth time, and went on to win his fifth championship in 2012.

It has been displayed at Nostell Priory since 1766, and was acquired by the National Trust in 2002. The National Trust claims that it is \\"the first known painting of a scene from Shakespeare\\". The painting is a rich and vibrant example of Hogarth's work, painted c.1730-1735 as a special project for one of his devoted band of patrons‚ÄîThe Earl of Macclesfield‚Äîas part of Hogarth's attempt to found an distinctively British school of history painting. It is thought that Hogarth was hoping that more commissions for similar scenes would come flowing in after painting this scene, but this did not happen. It measures and depicts a scene from Act 1 scene ii of William Shakespeare's play, The Tempest, with Ferdinand courting Miranda. Miranda is depicted sitting on a throne made of shells and coral, distracted and thus spilling from a bowl of milk that she has been feeding to a lamb. To the left is her father Prospero, and further left is Ferdinand. The spirit Ariel floats above, playing a lute or mandolin. To the right is the misshapen monster Caliban, with a bat above his head, grimacing and drooling as he stamps on a dove. The painting was bought from the Earl of Macclesfield's widow in 1766 by Sir Rowland Winn, 5th Baronet, and was hung on the walls of Nostell Priory, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England for over two centuries by the Winn Baronets and then their relatives the Barons St Oswald. Nostell Priory was acquired by the National Trust in 1953, but the former owners retained most of the contents. When the 6th Baron St Oswald announced his wish to sell the painting in 2002, it was bought by the National Trust, with the whole cost of nearly ¬£300,000 funded with a grant from the Art Fund.

WA was a breakfast television show broadcast in Western Australia. It was broadcast on Access 31 until the station's demise in 2008. Overview Wake Up! WA was a forum for Western Australians to discuss the latest matters affecting West Australian life. Guests often represented local charities, community or sporting organisations. The show updated viewers on local news, sport, weather, fuel prices and current affairs. With the success of Wake Up! WA, many opportunities became available for new talent to have real world experience in live television production that would otherwise be impossible. Jason Weeks, host of the show since its inception, interviewed more than 2,000 prominent politicians, business people, charitable bodies, sporting groups and community organisations. Demelza Goudie, a Western Australian music buff and community radio announcer took over from Sarah Lawrence as co-host for two seasons. Lawrence was originally brought on after the departure of the original co-host, Lisa Cooney, while the news and weather positions were available on a rotational basis for those brave enough to face the early morning starts for no pay. To split the workload, in 2007 the show was hosted on Mondays and Tuesdays by Edwina Nattrass and Matt Hern, a former regular guest presenter who provided viewers with financial advice. For the rest of the week, the journalist and presenter Anita Tassone hosted alongside Weeks, the only on-air team member to have been with the show since its inception. The final season, in 2008, had Tassone and Weeks hosting the show full-time, providing a minimum of four interviews per day, on a variety of socially relevant topics. Because of continued growth, the last seasons of Wake Up! WA were also uploaded to ISP iinet's server for their subscribers to watch in their media lounge. History Previously known as Wake Up Perth!, the show began broadcasting in September 2005. The show's presenters were chosen through a reality TV show called Your Big Break. This involved auditioning over 300 people for the available roles, through a weekend workshop to test contestants' ability to think fast, react to a changing environment, and not take themselves seriously. The original cast members were Jason Weeks and Lisa Cooney as hosts, Jo Newman on news and Alisa presenting sport and weather. Originally intended as a 12-week program, the popularity of the show ensured its future. With its growing popularity in 2006, Wake Up WA began rebroadcasting the live show each day (7-8 am) in a later time slot (10.30-11.30 am) to allow more viewers to watch the program. In less than a year, by mid-2006, the show had reached 300 original episodes, joining only a few locally produced shows that had ever reached this mark so soon. In early 2006, Wake Up Perth! was nominated for four Antenna Awards, winning the award for Best New Producer. In 2008, the show won Antenna Awards for Best News and Current Affairs Program. On August 6, 2008, Access 31 ceased transmission. At the time, Wake Up! WA had an estimated audience of 45,000 viewers for the live show, with another 25-30,000 tuning in for the daily rebroadcast. Over 500 episodes of the show had been produced. The producers had weighed up alternative broadcast options at the time, but nothing has yet come of it.Access 31 shuts doors in shock move  Regular guests  * Peter Fitzpatrick - Motor Trade Association * Allan Stiles - Grand Cinemas * Kylie Mathieson - Emerge One * Marnie Giroud - Wild Things * Grant Girdwood - Motoring * Peter Dingle - Murdoch University * Peter Nattrass - Former Lord Mayor of Perth * Mathias Cormann - Senator for Western Australia References External links *Wake up!

He was the author of the \\"Oslo Report\\", a major military intelligence leak which revealed German technological secrets to the British Government shortly after the start of World War II. Biography Hans Ferdinand Mayer studied mathematics, physics and astronomy at the University of Karlsruhe and the University of Heidelberg. In 1920, he attained a doctorate \\"on the behaviour of molecules in relation to free slow electrons\\". His professor was the Nobel Prize winner Philipp Lenard. In 1922 he joined the Berlin laboratory of Siemens & Halske AG. From 1926 he co-operated with Karl K√ºpfm√ºller. Both scientists concerned themselves with possibilities of interference-free information transfer of long haul circuits, important in developing telecommunications. In 1936 Mayer became the Director of the Siemens Research Laboratory in Berlin. In 1943 he was arrested for political reasons (listening to the BBC, and criticism of the Nazi regime), although the Nazis never knew of the existence of the Oslo Report. He was saved from execution by the intervention of his doctoral supervisor, Lenard, ironically an ardent Nazi supporter. He was first interned in Dachau, then in four other concentration camps until the end of the war. Johannes Plendl also played a role in his survival in the camps, by appointing Mayer to head a radio laboratory, even though Mayer had no experience in radio. After World War II Mayer, along with other German scientists, went to the USA as part of Operation Paperclip. Initially he worked in the U.S. Air Force‚Äôs primary research laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. In 1947 he moved on to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, as a Professor of Electrical Engineering. In 1950 he returned to Germany, where he was head of the Siemens & Halske research department for communications technology in Munich until 1962. Oslo Report Hans Ferdinand Mayer was the author of the Oslo Report, one of the most serious breaches of German security in World War II. He signed it as \\"a German scientist, who is on your side\\", before sending it to the British Embassy in Oslo, Norway, in early November 1939. In his position at Siemens he had access to a wide range of information regarding the development and application of electronics in current and future weapons systems and radar. The breadth (and uneven quality) of information in his Report led to initial scepticism amongst the British intelligence community about its veracity, but the technical detail of the information concerning electronics caught the attention of Dr. R.V. Jones, a brilliant young scientist who had recently been appointed to the Air Ministry. Jones, who was highly regarded by Churchill and eventually rose to the position of Assistant Director of Intelligence (Science), found the Oslo Report extremely useful in anticipating and countering the deployment of new German radar systems, and the radio beam systems used to guide German bombers to their targets. The existence of the Oslo Report became more widely known through a talk given by Jones in 1947, although he did not become aware of its author's identity until late 1953, finally confirming it by meeting Mayer in 1955. Jones agreed to keep Mayer's identity secret, to avoid possible retribution against Mayer and his family. Mayer did not tell his own family until 1977 that he had written the Oslo Report. His will was written so that his authorship of the Report would only be published after the death of himself and his wife. Jones respected Mayer's wishes, not revealing his identity until 1989. Works In November 1926, Mayer published an article (H. F. Mayer. \\"On the equivalent- circuit scheme of the amplifier tube\\". Telegraph and Telephony, 15:335-337, 1926) which describes the transformation of spare voltage supplies after equivalent current sources. It is an extension of Th√©venin's theorem stating that any collection of voltage sources and resistors with two terminals is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source. Edward Lawry Norton likewise described this in 1926 in an internal report for Bell Labs. The theorem is well-known under the name Norton's theorem or Mayer-Norton theorem. Hans Ferdinand Mayer published some 25 technical articles and held more than 80 patents.

The pig was then taken out the right-hand side into the lawn-seating area and proceeded to the middle rear of the crowd. The crowd eventually took control and briefly mobbed the pig before releasing it into the night sky. The pig allegedly travelled to downtown Dallas, where it hit a crane over Victory Park. The pig for the Dallas show was constructed by artist Frank Campagna. The dimensions of the pig were 30 √ó 15 feet.

The pig made four complete circles of the lawn-seating section before being released. One change in the pig's appearance was the absence of the \\"cut here\\" line, and the addition of two black eyes and a number of bruises. The pig was half pink and had large patches of bricks with graffiti-styled writing on them. The check mark next to \\"OBAMA\\" appears as a dotted edged square. The right side of the pig had the statement \\"All Religions Divide\\" written across it. The left side of the pig showed a caricature of President George W.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center criticised Waters by stating \\"Waters has been a supporter of the anti-Israel BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement. Forget Israel/Palestine. Waters deployed a classic disgusting medieval anti- Semitic caricature widely used by both Nazi and Soviet propaganda to incite hatred against Jews.\\". On 1 August 2013, Waters posted an open letter on his Facebook page in response to Cooper's \\"entirely predictable resulting rant.\\" Addressing Cooper, Waters wrote, \\"I hold your outburst to be inflammatory and un-helpful and would suggest it can only impede progress towards peace and understanding between people. It is also extremely insulting to me personally in that you accuse me of being 'Anti Semitic', 'A Jew Hater' and 'Nazi Sympathizer'... I have many very close Jewish friends, one of whom, interestingly enough, is the nephew of the late Simon Wiesenthal. I am proud of that association; Simon Wiesenthal was a great man... I have often come under attack by the pro Israel lobby because of my support for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) which I won't go into here... However I will say this, in a functioning theocracy it is almost inevitable that the symbol of the religion becomes confused with the symbol of the state, in this case the State of Israel... Like it or not, the Star of David represents Israel and its policies and is legitimately subject to any and all forms of non-violent protest. To peacefully protest against Israel's racist domestic and foreign policies is NOT ANTI-SEMITIC.\\" Waters also wrote, \\"For the sake of some perspective. The inflatable pig...has appeared at every Wall Show since September 2010, some 193 shows, yours is the first complaint. Also the pig in question represents evil, and more specifically the evil of errant government. We make a gift of this symbol of repression to the audience at the end of every show and the people always do the right thing. They destroy it.\\", An Open Letter from Roger Waters, 1 August 2013.

A son of James Chapman and Elizabeth Greeff of Malmesbury and brother to Henry Samuel Chapman, he was educated in Cape Town and left for Durban when 14 years old. He was appointed as chief clerk in the Native Affairs Department in 1848. A year later he settled in Potchefstroom where he became one of the first storekeepers. Shortly after, in 1852, he ventured across the Limpopo River and into Bamangwato country. He became friendly with Khama, one of the sons of Sekgoma, the Bamangwato chief, enlisting his aid in reaching the Chobe River. Early the following year found him on the Zambesi River which he explored to within of the Victoria Falls, almost beating David Livingstone to their discovery. By 1854 he had teamed up with Samuel H. Edwards, another explorer, and launched an expedition to Lake Ngami after which he trekked through the territory between Northern Bechuanaland and the Zambesi. An easygoing man, he was able to get on with the Bushman hunters of the semi-desert interior and spent long periods in their company, obtaining valuable help from them. Returning to Ngami, he travelled north to the Okavango River, crossing Damaraland and reaching Walvis Bay. Here he busied himself with cattle-trading in Damaraland, before setting out on an expedition with his brother Henry and Thomas Baines and lasting from December 1860 to September 1864. Their aim was to explore the Zambesi from the Victoria Falls down to its delta, with a view to testing its navigability. However, these plans were bedevilled by sickness and misfortune. They did reach the Zambesi, but did not get to explore the mouth. On 23 July 1862 they reached the Victoria Falls. It was on this expedition that Baines painted many of his famous scenes which were reproduced in an album of prints. His attempt at exploring the Zambesi ruined his health and exhausted his finances. He returned to Cape Town in 1864, dispirited and fever-stricken. The expedition was notable since it was the first time that a stereoscopic camera had been used to record its progress. The size of the negatives was about 6 x 4.5 inches and of rather poor quality. Prints of these photographs are at the Africana Museum in Johannesburg. Sir George Grey commissioned him to capture live animals and to compile glossaries of the Bantu languages. Chapman kept diaries throughout his journeys, but his Travels in the Interior of South Africa appeared only in 1868, shortly before his death. Chapman travelled at times with Francis Galton and C.J. Andersson. He attempted to farm at Anawood on the banks of the Swakop river in 1863 and 1864, but was forced to abandon his holding due to the Nama-Ovaherero War, in which he refused to become involved. From 1864 until 1870 he lived at various places in South Africa, but returned as a trader and hunter to Hereroland and Ovamboland between 1870 and 1871. He died at Du Toit's Pan near Kimberley, on 4 February 1872, aged 40 years. Family In 1857 he married Catherine Cecelia Roome, daughter of Capt. William Roome, (master of the vessel \\"Olivia\\" on which Thomas Baines arrived at Cape Town on 23 November 1842) and Catherine Cecelia Bushnell (who was born in Virginia USA - her father, also a sea captain apparently settled in Nova Scotia). James and Catherine had four children. One of their sons, William James Bushnell Chapman (1858‚Äì1932) became a trader, hunter and farmer. He came to Namibia as a child in 1864, spent ten years in Cape Town and returned on 16 June 1874 to Walvis Bay as assistant at Harrison's store. He traded and hunted in Ovamboland in 1875, then went to Angola in 1881 and farmed at Humpata :pt:Humpata. He finally resettled in 1928 with other Angola Boers in the Gobabis district of Namibia, where he died in October 1932. Another son, Charles Henry Chapman, was born in Cape Town and boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a second class passenger (ticket number 248731, ¬£13 10s). He carried with him the family bible belonging to his grandparents' family in Virginia and/or Nova Scotia; Chapman himself lived in The Bronx, NY. He died at age 52 of hypothermia and drowning after the sinking in the early hours of 15 April 1912; his body was later recovered by the Mackay-Bennett. Henry Samuel Chapman (1834‚Äì1922), brother of James Chapman, arrived at Walvis Bay by sea in February 1860 and travelled extensively as a hunter and trader between Walvis Bay, Ovamboland, Hereroland, Lake Ngami and the Cape until 1863. He later lived at Oudtshoorn, Kimberley and Johannesburg, and died in August 1922 at Braamfontein in South Africa. External links *Victims of the Titanic *Thos.

In 1390 he obtained from King Robert II a grant of his ward-relief and marriage for the Earldom of March and lordship of Annandale; and he acted as a Commissioner for liberating from English captivity Murdoch, son of the Regent Albany, on 7 December 1411,Bain (1888), vol.iv, p.164, nos.701 & 813 and in 1415. \\"George de Dounbar, son and heir of the Earl of the Marches of Scotland\\" had a further Safe-conduct, with numerous other nobles, to travel to England between 1416 and 1419.Bain (1888), vol.iv, p.179-180, no.894 Ambassador On 19 August 1423 \\"George, Earl of March\\" and his brother Sir Patrick de Dunbar of Beil were named as part of the embassy sent to negotiate the liberation of King James I of Scotland who had long been a captive in England.Bain (1888), vol.iv, p.188, no.932 On 28 March 1424, the Earl of March was one of the Conservators of the seven-year truce with England, and met James I and his consort at Durham upon their return to Scotland. He was also present at their Coronation in Scone on 24 May 1424, when he was knighted. However the following year the earls of Dunbar and Douglas, with the Duke of Albany, and twenty other feudal barons, were suddenly arrested and confined by order of parliament after accusations of corruption in Scottish affairs during James's absence. Albany and his sons, with his father-in-law the Earl of Lennox were beheaded, but the Earl of Dunbar and most of the other barons were set at liberty, their guilt being less apparent. In 1427 the earls of Dunbar and Douglas obtained, in London, a truce from King Henry VI of England for two years, which Sir Robert Umfraville, governor of Berwick-upon-Tweed had refused. George was next employed in negotiating more temporary truces with England in June 1429 and the following January;Bain (1888), vol.iv, pps:188/212-3, nos.932 & 1032 and officiated as sponsor for King James II of Scotland at Holyroodhouse in October 1430. Conspiracy and downfall In 1434 Dunbar and his son Patrick were twice in England and the usual jealousies of the Crown and opponents in Scotland were aroused and the earl was arrested upon his return and confined in Edinburgh Castle, while the Earl of Angus, Chancellor Crichton, and Sir Adam Hepburn of Hailes, were dispatched with Letters to the Keeper of Dunbar Castle who immediately surrendered it to the King's authority, Hepburn being left as Constable of the important fortress. In a parliament which assembled at Perth on 10 January 1435, George, Earl of March, Lord of Dunbar, etc., was accused, not for any treason committed by himself, but for holding his earldoms and estates which were claimed to have been forfeited by his father. The following day \\"in vain did he plead,\\" says Sir Robert Douglas, \\"that his father had been pardoned and restored by Albany\\", and it was answered \\"that a forfeiture incurred for treason could not be pardoned by a Regent\\". The forfeited Earl retired into obscurity in England. A Safe-conduct warrant was signed for \\"George, Earl of Dunbar, with twenty-four horsemen\\" at Westminster on 31 October 1435.Bain (1888), vol.iv, p.223, no.1086 However, it appears he may have been still alive in 1457 when he is mentioned (still as \\"Earl of March\\") in a charter to his son, Patrick de Dunbar, of the lands and barony of Kilconquhar, in Fife, held of the Archbishop of St. Andrews as superior.

While Christina Aguilera was responsible for making \\"I Turn to You\\" a big hit, American R&B; boy band All-4-One had originally performed it for the Space Jam soundtrack. Trisha Yearwood had covered \\"How Do I Live\\" the same year LeAnn Rimes did, and though Rimes' version had been more successful in charting, Yearwood's version (which was also successful) was the first of the two to be released. In 1998, for the first time in history, the Grammy Awards nominated two artists for the same song in the same category. Directly following Rimes' performance of the song, Yearwood won the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Yearwood also performed the song at the Country Music Association for which she won the 1997 award for Female Vocalist of the Year. Yearwood also won the 1997 Academy of Country Music Award for Top Female Vocalist. \\"Set the Night to Music\\" was originally recorded by Starship, but the US and Taiwan editions have Roberta Flack and Maxi Priest as the performers. * Another cover version, \\"I Don't Want To Be Your Friend\\" performed by Nina was included in the Philippine edition which was originally by Cyndi Lauper in her 1989 album, A Night To Remember. This cover version by Nina was also included in her \\"Nina Live\\" album and as a single peaked at #1 for eight weeks in the Philippines. * The Indonesian/Malaysian edition of the album features a new song, \\"Can't Remember a Time\\", recorded by Indonesian singer Krisdayanti.

It grows naturally in Botswana, South Africa and Namibia. The species became internationally known and threatened by collectors, after a marketing campaign falsely claimed that it was an appetite suppressant for weight loss. The flowers smell like rotten meat and are pollinated mainly by flies. The indigenous San people of the Namib desert call this plant «Åhoba (pronounced ‚Äì the initial sound is a lateral click) ‚Äì and the Afrikaans name ghaap is used to refer to all species of Hoodia. Potential properties The genus became internationally known and threatened by collectors, after a marketing campaign falsely claimed that it was an appetite suppressant for weight loss. Folk medicine practitioners indigenous to Southern Africa believed the plant to be an appetite suppressant and to have other medicinal properties, such as treating indigestion and small infections. In 1977, the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) isolated the ingredient in hoodia‚Äînow known as P57‚Äîwhich may be responsible for its putative appetite- suppressant effect, and patented it in 1996. The CSIR then granted United Kingdom-based Phytopharm a license, and they collaborated with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer to isolate active ingredients from the extracts and look into synthesizing them for use as an appetite suppressant. Pfizer released the rights to the primary ingredient in 2002. Paul Hutson, associate professor in the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison School of Pharmacy, told the Wisconsin State Journal, \\"For Pfizer to release something dealing with obesity suggests to me that they felt there was no merit to its oral use.\\"Rath, Jay. \\"New Drug Tempting Dieters, But Experts Debate Hoodia's Merits\\".

Seattle Times, March 9, 2006 Jasjit Bindra, lead researcher for hoodia at Pfizer, states there were indications of unwanted effects on the liver caused by other components, which could not be easily removed from the supplement, adding, \\"Clearly, hoodia has a long way to go before it can earn approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Until safer formulations are developed, dieters should be wary of using it.\\"Bindra, Jasjit. \\"A Popular Pill's Hidden Danger\\", The New York Times, April 26, 2005 In 2002, CSIR officially recognized the San tribespeople‚Äôs rights over hoodia, allowing them to take a percentage of the profits and any spin-offs resulting from the marketing of hoodia.Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (24 March 2003) The San and the CSIR announce a benefit-sharing agreement for potential anti-obesity drug.

Painting of H. gordonii by Robert Jacob Gordon Research According to a 2006 review, no published scientific evidence supported hoodia as an appetite suppressant in humans.Kathleen Doheney, \\"Hoodia: Lots of Hoopla, Little Science; Few studies support the promise of the South African appetite suppressant, but believers abound\\", WebMD, September 6, 2006, Reviewed by Louise Chang, MD (last accessed March 24, 2007) One review suggested that any weight loss effects from consuming hoodia dietary supplements may simply be secondary symptoms of potentially serious adverse effects that may occur from using it. The United States Federal Trade Commission recommends against the use of such diet products marketed with exaggerated claims for losing body weight through the use of dietary supplements, skin patches or creams.Weighing the Evidence in Diet Ads, US Federal Trade Commission; July 2012 Authentication As H. gordonii and the whole genus Hoodia are threatened with extinction if international trade is not monitored, the genus is listed under CITES at Appendix II, and it is illegal to export plant material in any form from Africa without a CITES certificate being issued by proper authorities. In the USA, the Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Agriculture, and United States Customs and Border Protection regulate the importation and re-exportation of species such as H. gordonii. Current U.S. laws stipulate that not only must a CITES certificate accompany shipments, but also the importers must possess a permit issued by the USDA to import terrestrial plants. A CITES re-export certificate is needed to re-export H. gordonii. The primary testing methods for authenticating H. gordonii are: * HPTLC * HPLC * Microscopy /DPI * Direct assay of the active component, \\"P57\\" As of 2007, four independent labs are conducting tests to verify H. gordonii in consumer products. They are: Advanced Laboratories, Inc. in Smithfield, North Carolina, Alkemist Pharmaceuticals, Chromadex Labs of Irvine, California, and the University of Mississippi. The American Herbal Products Association completed work in 2009 establishing the de facto industry standard for authentication in response to scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission of the hoodia industry and complaints by consumers of fraudulent hoodia products being marketed. Media coverage The BBC reported on the H. gordonii plant in 2003.Mangold, Tom. \\"Sampling the Kalahari Hoodia diet\\". BBC Correspondent, May 30, 2003. On November 21, 2004, 60 Minutes aired a report on the effectiveness of the plant as a natural appetite suppressant.Stahl, Lesley. \\"African Plant May Help Fight Fat\\". CBS News 60 Minutes, November 21, 2004. The media coverage and heavy marketing by nutritional supplement companies have created such a demand for Hoodia spp. plants that a protected status was imposed in several countries, such as Namibia. Many products claiming to contain Hoodia spp. do not actually contain the active ingredient alleged to suppress appetite. An ongoing review of hoodia pills by Alkemists Pharmaceuticals found at least half of the products advertised as containing hoodia contained none.Engelhaupt, Erika (July 9, 2006). \\"But do Hoodia diet pills actually work? Diet miracle from an African plant is a spam special\\". The Philadelphia Inquirer. In March 2006, Consumer Reports investigated the dietary supplement and concluded, \\"This weight loss drug lacks the clinical evidence for the Consumer Reports experts to recommend this product.\\"\\"Hoodia: lose weight without feeling hungry?\\" (Subscription required) Consumer Reports 2006 Mar; 71(3):49. Marketing and spam Lack of scientific evidence or regulatory approvals have not stopped dietary supplement companies from marketing H. gordonii supplements with claims that it can reduce appetite and cause weight loss. Goen Technologies Corporation's TrimSpa unit began marketing it under the brand name X32 with celebrity spokesperson Anna Nicole Smith, though the FDA has notified Trimspa in a Warning Letter that it has not demonstrated that claims for their product are scientifically supportable.US Food and Drug Administration (March 26, 2004). \\"Warning Letter for Weight Loss Products 'TrimSpa Carb Blocker' and 'TrimSpa Fat Blocker'\\" Health Canada has not approved any hoodia products for sale.Hawaleshka, Danylo. \\"Hoodia love: An appetite suppressant used by Bushmen is the diet world's newest fad\\" . Macleans, August 3, 2005. However, they are sold in natural health stores. Goen Technologies was sued by the state of New Jersey for misleading consumers.New Jersey Office of the Attorney General (October 16, 2003). New Jersey Sues Founder of Goen Seminars. The Trimspa brand was the subject of a lawsuit in California, which claims it does not contain any of hoodia's active ingredient. In December 2004, Unilever entered into an agreement with Phytopharm to start marketing H. gordonii commercially in the form of shakes and diet bars, although as of April 2007, no products have yet surfaced on the consumer market from that venture.Tomlinson, Heather, \\"Prickly solution to obesity?\\", The Guardian Weekly, (undated). In 2008 Unilever pulled out of deal with Phytopharm to continue commercial development of hoodia. A document on Unilever's website entitled \\"Sustainable Development 2008: An Overview\\", and signed by Paul Polman, CEO, contains the following statement: \\"Innovation also carries uncertainties and does not always lead to a positive outcome. During 2008, having invested 20 million [pounds] in R&D;, Unilever abandoned plans to use the slimming extract hoodia in a range of diet products. We stopped the project because our clinical studies revealed that products using hoodia would not meet our strict standards of safety and efficacy.\\" Page 12. Between March and June 2006, millions of e-mail spam and forum messages were sent out concerning hoodia, ostensibly offering hoodia extracts for weight control purposes. The Federal Trade Commission logged numerous complaints of consumer fraud associated with hoodia. In October 2009, Santa Cruz County District Attorney Bob Lee joined colleagues from several other counties in a lawsuit against three companies that allegedly make false claims that their diet supplements contain extract from the African hoodia plant. The lawsuit, filed in Solano County, stated that Dex L-10 by Delmar Labs, Breakthrough Engineered Nutrition and Geopharma produce products with packaging and advertising that claim to contain H. gordonii when they contained little or none of it.Santa Cruz, other DAs sue manufacturers of weight loss products, Santa Cruz Sentinel, October 1, 2009 References External links *Hoodia: Lots of Hoopla, Little Science *CNN report on hoodia gordonii Category:Plants used in traditional African medicine Category:Succulent plants ","title":"Hoodia gordonii"},{"id":"11729164","text":"James Hutchins Johnson (June 3, 1802 - September 2, 1887) was a businessman, militia officer, and politician from Bath, New Hampshire.

It was developed by cooperation between Jonathon Welch, Jason Stephens and RecLink. It came to prominence as the subject of a five-part Australian Broadcasting Corporation documentary TV series of the same name, broadcast weekly from May 2007. They released two albums, Choir of Hard Knocks: the Voice of RecLink (26 May 2007), which peaked at No. 21 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and Songs of Hope and Inspiration (7 December 2007), which reached No. 39\\\\. A DVD of the series also titled, Choir of Hard Knocks: the Voice of RecLink, was issued in August. A second series in November 2007 followed the choir members preparing for a concert at the Sydney Opera House. In April 2009 the choir was replaced by the Choir of Hope and Inspiration after a falling-out between Welch and RecLink. History The Choir of Hard Knocks were formed in September 2006 by cooperation between Jonathon Welch, founding musical director and former tenor with Opera Australia; Jason Stephens of FremantleMedia Australia, TV series creator; and RecLink, a not for profit community organisation that provides sport and arts opportunities to those experiencing social and economic disadvantage. Their name references the phrase, school of hard knocks: learning by experiencing life, not through classrooms. Welch had studied the Montreal Homeless Men's Choir in late 1999 and established a choir of homeless people for a TV project ‚Äì the Sydney Street Choir ‚Äì in 2001. Stephens and his organisation, FremantleMedia Australia, created the ABC TV five-part documentary series, Choir of Hard Knocks, after pitching the idea to chronicle the formation and progress of a choir in Melbourne. In 2005 Stephens had also learnt of the Montreal group and convinced Welch to participate in the documentary as music director and choirmaster. The funding organisation behind the choir was managed by RecLink, which subsequently expanded its choir program nationally and later supported eight similar choirs around Australia including the Transformers, Choir of High Hopes Hobart, Sydney Street Choir and the Rocky Road Choir. Recruiting was by word of mouth and through community organisations with rehearsals beginning in September 2006. The original ensemble had 47 members. Welch canvassed other charities for funding and support to advertise the choir's first rehearsal. After six weeks of rehearsals, their premiere performance occurred in October 2016. Bridget McManus of The Age, observed, \\"the timing might not have been perfect, the soloist was a little shaky, and a wild-haired man at the back had a tendency to echo the last word of every line, but the infectious enthusiasm of the group belting out 'Blame It on the Boogie' ‚Äî in unison, with all the actions ‚Äî was hard to ignore. At the front of the group, by the Flinders Street Station steps, stood a spirited conductor on whom all singers' eyes were fixed despite the peak-hour bustle.\\" As at May 2007, the choir had about 50 members. The choir raised money, initially, to record a CD single for promotion and individual sales, through busking in city streets. They also held a fund- raising concert at the Melbourne Town Hall on 7 March 2007. For that performance they were supported by Melbourne Gay and Lesbian Chorus and by the Sydney Street Choir. Weekly broadcasts of the TV series commenced in early May 2007. The Choir of Hard Knocks later performed at the Sydney Opera House, which was broadcast in a second series as Choir of Hard Knocks Opera House Special in November. A self-titled companion CD to the first series, Choir of Hard Knocks: the Voice of RecLink, was released on 26 May 2007 containing traditional songs, \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" and cover versions of pop rock tracks, \\"Flame Trees\\" (originally by Cold Chisel) and \\"Hallelujah\\" (Leonard Cohen). Seven tracks were recorded at Sing Sing Studios, Richmond, nine tracks were recorded live from their first Melbourne Town Hall concert. It was each and every member's first experience in a recording studio. The album peaked at No. 21 on the ARIA Albums Chart and remained in the top 50 for 16 weeks. At the end of that year it was certified as a platinum record for shipment of 70,000 units. It appeared at No. 3 on ARIA's End of Year Charts ‚Äì Top 50 Classical Albums 2007 and No. 46 on the next year's chart. An associated DVD of the same name was issued in August 2007 and became the second highest selling Australian documentary DVD for that year. Their second album, Songs of Hope and Inspiration was released on 7 December 2007, which reached No. 39. By the end of the following year it was certified gold for shipment of 35,000 copies. It appeared at No. 9 on ARIA's End of Year Charts ‚Äì Top 50 Classical Albums 2007 and No. 43 in the following year. The DVD of the second series, Choir of Hard Knocks: Opera House Special, was issued in November 2008. Choir of Hope and Inspiration Following a split between RecLink and Welch in March 2009, the latter formed a new not-for-profit entity, the Melbourne Street Choir, Inc (MSC). Supported by a pro bono committee of management (board), MSC focussed on a new choir and delivered a greater level of transparency and accountability to choir members in relation to all of its activities. Many members of the original choir followed Welch to the MSC which recommenced public performances from 29 April 2009 at the Melbourne International Jazz Festival. On 21 May Welch launched the Choir of Hope and Inspiration with a training choir, the Morning Bell Choir (named due to their training sessions beginning early in the day), while the main choir was established as the Choir of Pride & Joy. Awards At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 Choir of Hard Knocks won Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album for their first CD. The ceremony for ARIA's Artisan Awards was held at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music on 15 October. The choir won over nominees such as David Bridie and the popular Sydney ensemble Monsieur Camembert.

Global Agenda was started in 2005 as the studio's first project. The game went live on February 1, 2010.Global Agenda on Steam Store In April 2011, Global Agenda was re-released as a free- to-play game. The game's servers were shut down in 2018Hi-Rez co-founder Todd Harris on Twitter. Gameplay The game features a third-person camera view, although some weapons allow scoping in a first-person view using a mouse action. Characters have jetpacks, as well as various weapon types, including melee. Global Agenda features a large degree of variability in player appearance with unique achievement-based flair items; almost all player items can be re-colored using dyes for additional personalization. Global Agendas lore and gameplay center around Dome City, which acts as an open world lobby. Players can explore and shop, and boosted players can use their jetpacks, but weapons and skills are disabled. Most of the game revolves around mercenary matches (PvP) or instances (PvE). There are two playable open world zones, the Sonoran Desert and North Sonora. Players can also take part in Agency vs Agency (AvA) which is Global Agendas guild-centric competitive mode. The game features four classes: Assault, Recon, Medic, and Robotics. All have customizable skill trees and their own weapons. Players can reset their skills at any time and at no cost while in Dome City. As a result, in order to have access to every specialization of every class, a player needs four characters, one for each class. Global Agenda includes almost no randomness; the same hit from the same weapon under the same circumstances always does the same damage. All weapons with innate inaccuracy are fast firing, minimizing the impact of random bullet trajectory on gameplay. There are no critical hits and no headshots, not even with sniper rifles. Mercenary Mode For more casual games, players can enter the Mercenary queue. The game attempts to make two 10-player, skill-balanced teams based on each player's star rating. Players are then entered into a match whose mode is determined by that player's filters, if they have any. Global Agenda supports the following modes: *Breach - One team defends three points, in succession, while the other attempts to capture them, in order. The attacking team wins if they capture all three points. The defending team wins if time runs out. Additional time is given after each capture. *Scramble - A control point is placed on a random point on the map after each capture and both teams attempt to capture it first. Three captures (or the higher number in case of a deadlock) wins. *Control - three control points are open on the map simultaneously. Whichever team has the majority of control points in control slowly gains match points. The first to reach 800 points wins. *Payload - The attacking team attempts to push a bomb to the end of the track. The defending team attempts to halt or reverse their progress. The attacking team wins if the payload reaches the final point on the track. The defending team wins when time runs out. *Acquisition - This is a tweak on capture the flag, except in this case, the flag is a robot. Once a robot is \\"activated\\" by a player stepping inside it, it can be both damaged and healed. It must be destroyed before it reaches the other side, or the enemy team scores. Three points (or higher in case of a deadlock) are needed to win. Special Ops For cooperative games, players can queue for Special Ops. Teams of 1-4 players can attempt to clear instances of enemy non-player characters. Players have 20 minutes to reach the instance boss, and then get at least four minutes to defeat it. There are four difficulties: *Medium Security - The easiest difficulty available, these missions are canonically the first to have been undertaken by the Armed Revolutionary Militia and focus on the clearing of immediate threats to Dome City. Maps feature either Bandit bases or Recursive hives. *High Security - This is the first mode where players fight the Commonwealth. It features high-tech labs and weapons manufacturing facilities. Players occasionally encounter enemy Elite Agents, which mirror the playable classes. Helots mirror Assaults, Assassins mirror Recons, Alchemists mirror Medics, and Techros mirror Robotics. Bosses are more difficult. *Maximum Security - Patrol scanners start appearing in this difficulty. Their alarms spawn enemy reinforcements the first time they are tripped. Hunter Spiders, who can pull Agents from safety, start appearing. Additionally, there are more enemies, more Elite Agents, and more enemies spawn in the boss room. *Ultra-Max Security - In the highest difficulty, minion Androids are replaced by more dangerous Minion Ballistae and Minion Sentinels. Enemy density is increased. There are larger groups of Elite Agents. Alarms summon reinforcements every time they are tripped, rather than only once. Guardians start appearing. The boss room starts with a significant number of Elite Agents and enemies. Agency vs Agency In Agency vs Agency (AvA), agencies compete for terrain on hex-based zones. There are three geographic regions supported, North America (NA), Europe (EU), and Pacific (PAC). Each geographic region has two zones, one for a weekday season and one for a weekend season. Weekday seasons have ten total days in the season, whereas weekend seasons have four. AvA is open in a zone during that geographic region's primetime hours. Facilities can be bought or produced by agencies to be put onto each hex. Labs produce blueprints which are consumed when they are used. Mines produce materials needed by blueprints. Factories combine materials and blueprints to make usable items. Whenever something is produced, an agency gains Networth. After two weeks, the agency with the highest Networth wins the season. Agencies in the top three positions get rewards on top of what was produced during the season, such as the Black Lance Vandal and Dark Steel Vindicator. Players also receive holographic armor and dyes for coming in the top three or first for several seasons. Plot Global Agenda mixes a science fiction setting with a secret agent backdrop, leading the developers to refer to the game genre as spy-fi. The game is set in 2155, in the wake of a severe global disaster. An Orwellian government called the Commonwealth tyrannically rules Earth with an army of artificially intelligent drones. Earth's population is under one billion people and suffers from a shortage of habitable land. Advanced technology allows limited regions of Earth to be environmentally cleansed and habitable. As land becomes available there is intense competition to colonize the area and control that region's technology. This competition sets the stage for much of the game's campaign action. The Recursive Colony update expanded on a threat of self-replicating machines called Recursives. Through exploration and investigation in the new North Sonoran desert zone, players learn of a massing of Recursive forces. The quest line leads into the hourly raids where Recursives attempt to break into and capture Dome City. The final mission allows as many players as desired to take part in an attempt to simultaneously destroy four objectives, thus disrupting the Recursive colony and (temporarily, at least), ending the Recursive threat. Hi-Rez has released several pieces of fiction to establish the back-story as well as a timeline for what occurred in the Global Agenda universe before the game begins: Pre-Commonwealth and Post-Commonwealth. Development and release Promotion at E3 2010 Pricing for the North American version of Global Agenda was announced on October 20, 2009. The pricing model was said to reflect the games' positioning as a hybrid between a multiplayer, hub-based shooter and a larger-scale persistent world online shooter MMO. Pricing was initially planned to include an optional \\"Global Agenda: Conquest\\" subscription package. As of June 25, 2010, Global Agenda announced that it was going subscription-free and all content that previously required a monthly subscription fee is available to all players who have purchased the game. Trial accounts do not receive these benefits. Global Agenda's trial accounts are for an unlimited amount of time but can only advance to a limited level. On April 7, 2011, Hi-Rez Studios stated that the upcoming update would bring the game's subscription model to free-to-play. Expansions Sandstorm In Q2 2010, Hi-Rez released a Global Agenda expansion entitled Sandstorm. Sandstorm was released in two major phases: Phase One (1.3) included changes to weapons and armor, loot drops and an HA overhauled crafting system. and Phase Two (1.35) included the introduction of a new \\"Sonoran Desert\\" Open Zone, additional mission styles, including 10-person defense raids and Special Ops missions, Consumables and Salvage and an overhaul to the in-game credit and token system. Free Agent On April 2011, Hi-Rez released Free Agent highlighting a move to free-to-play, balance changes and the introduction of new end-game raid content, Dome Defense. Free Agent included the overhaul of skill trees to encourage role specialization. The Dome Defense raid pits teams of ten players against a more powerful threat to the Dome. Reception Global Agenda achieved a 70% average from critics on Metacritic. IGN's said that the game \\"hits the top notes in many areas. The crisp graphics and fast paced, high intensity team-based combat are definitely the game's strongest points\\" while also noting that players are best off finding an Agency (guild) to \\"suit your play style and personality, as it's all about teamwork and the people you play with\\". Eurogamer was more critical and said \\"a shooter without eloquence or crunch, an MMO without content or personality, and as an experimental combination of the two it's missing ambition\\". Sequel On October 2, 2012 Hi-Rez announced on its forums that development had started on Global Agenda 2. According to the post, the sequel will focus more on PvP and use a lot of assets from the original Global Agenda. It will add maps, game modes, class weapons, and be built on Hi-Rez's newest platform. Beta testing was expected to begin in mid-2013. In an interview with Joystiq, Hi-Rez COO Todd Harris said of Global Agenda 2, \\"No open world elements planned\\", and \\"No plan for hex-maps or facility building\\". He mentioned that players of the original Global Agenda and other Hi-Rez games will be given priority beta access. In a response to an open letter to Hi-Rez, Harris said that as of July 2013, Hi-Rez planned to focus on Smite for the next six months, before focusing on Global Agenda 2.

Brighton  Komedia Brighton Komedia is owned by Colin Granger, Marina Kobler and Richard Daws. It was formed in 1994 by Colin Granger, Marina Kobler and David Lavender, beginning as a theatre and cabaret bar in a converted Grade II-listed former billiard hall in Brighton's Kemptown area. Richard Daws became involved in 2001 when he partnered with the venue to form Komedia Entertainment, a management and production company set up after the sale of his production company Victoria Real to Endemol UK. The Komedia logo was designed by Nick Williams of the Matt Black design partnership. In the early days, Komedia promoted many young performers including Graham Norton, Mel & Sue, Johnny Vegas, Jack Dee, Al Murray, Jenny Eclair, Tim Vine, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ricky Tomlinson, Rhona Cameron and The League of Gentlemen. In 1998 the company moved into a former Tesco supermarket on Gardner Street in the North Laine area of Brighton. On its relocation in 2000, the Brighton Komedia grew to include three spaces: Komedia Upstairs, Komedia Downstairs and the Studio Bar, as well as a street- front caf√© and box office on Gardner Street.

Previously used as a port, the town is now a residential settlement and popular tourist destination known for its recreational fishing, with a boat ramp and jetty located in the town. At the 2016 census, the locality of Smoky Bay had a population of 279 of which 217 lived in the town of Smoky Bay. History European discovery and settlement Smoky Bay's coastline was first sighted and mapped by the British navigator, Matthew Flinders, in 1802, who named it \\"Smoky Bay\\" after the amount of smoke from fires lit by the area's Aboriginal people. Whalers were the first Europeans to inhabit the coastline near the current site of the town, just north of Pt. Collinson. Recently, dune erosion has uncovered parts of the ruins of their camps, with pieces of whale bone and three one-hundred gallon cooking pots discovered. The historic Port Collinson Whaling Station remnants are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. In the early 1860s pastoralists arrived in the district. Former Adelaide civil servant Charles Francis Heath (1832‚Äì83) established a sheep grazing property which he named Wallanippie Station after the Aboriginal name of a waterhole near his homestead at the back of Point Brown promontory. A feud took place in 1865 between two Aboriginal men at Wallanippie Station, resulting in one being speared and the other charged with murder.Advertiser, 17 August 1865, page 3. Heath was required to attend the Supreme Court in Adelaide as a witness. The trial was notable in that it was an instance of British law intervening in traditional Aboriginal law. Following that the government decided that the developing district needed established law and order. On 16 November 1865, Heath was appointed the first justice of the peace and local magistrate for Smoky Bay.S.A. Government Gazette, 16 November 1865. After nearly ten years on Eyre Peninsula, Heath returned to Adelaide and rejoined the civil service. Establishment of the government town In the early 1900s the town area was opened up, with the first building a tin hut erected in 1905. Scrubcutters cleared the area by 1906, and by 1911 a post office, repeating station and living quarters had been built. The town continued to grow, with a school and hall opened in 1909. A jetty was proposed for erection in 1908, and finally completed in 1913. The town of Smoky Bay was surveyed in 1913 under the name of Wallanippie, along with the aforementioned jetty and a Harbour's Board reserve. A large galvanised iron goods shed and a railway line extending to the far end of the jetty were established, allowing the town to operate as a port. The town's original name of \\"Wallanippie\\" was officially changed to \\"Smoky Bay\\" in 1940, after continued use of this name by locals since the town's establishment. The town became less important throughout the mid 1900s, and its capacity as a port was diminished, leaving the town as a residential, as well as an agricultural centre for the surrounding community. The growing of oysters was established in the bay in 1988, providing a new economic facet for the town, and adding to the town's promise as a tourist destination. During the 2002/2003 summer, a ban on taking all shellfish from the waters of the bay was imposed after a deadly biotoxin was discovered in the shellfish. Geography The town of Smoky Bay lies on the bay of the same name, north of Streaky Bay. The bay is shielded from ocean swells by a small promenade of land that leads to Point Brown. Around 10 km offshore lies \\"Eyre Island\\", a small, sandy island that also protects the bay. Offshore lie a number of small, granitic islands which are home to many seabirds and tiger snakes that feed on the birds. The Nuyts Archipelago lies to the west, the islands of which are not easily accessible. Inside the bay, the calm waters are dominated by shallow stretches of seagrass, sandflats, mudflats, as well as numerous channels or \\"creeks\\" that allow boat access, with slightly deeper water. Surrounding the bay is a mixture of mangroves to the south and coastal sand dune vegetation to the north. The mangroves tend to give the water in some parts of the bay a yellow stain, presumed to be from tannins and decaying leaf matter. The town itself is situated on a long, sandy beach that ends at the boat ramp. Inland is dominated by agricultural land, used for cropping and grazing of sheep. The bay is home to a large variety of seabirds, as well as many fish species, including Great White Sharks, which are frequent visitors from the offshore islands. Seals also enter the bay, providing further incentive for sharks to enter the bay. Economy The town has long since ceased function as a port, but since 1988 has experienced a surge in the aquaculture of oysters. The initial area allocation was of 85 ha within Smoky Bay, with individual farms having a maximum size of 10 ha. This has since been increased to 165 ha (including 40 ha of subtidal or deepwater culture). Smoky Bay oysters are well recognized within South Australia, along with other producers such as Coffin Bay. Tourism has been a rapidly expanding sector of the town's economy, with a caravan park and numerous beach side shacks established. Recreational fishing is the largest draw to the town, with the jetty and boat ramp heavily used in the summer holidays. Other water based sports such as swimming and snorkelling are popular, with a large shark proof cage constructed on the side of the jetty. Swimming outside of this enclosure can be risky, as evident by a recent death caused by a large shark in the bay. The local oyster industry has been the source of tourist attractions also, with guided tours now established. Community The town has around 200 permanent residents, with that number swelling to around 1000 in the peak summer months. The small town has a very basic general store and petrol and diesel are occasionally available. There is a sporting club north of the caravan park with an oval and tennis courts. The club serves meals and is open to the general public. There is a single church, of the Uniting denomination opposite the caravan park. The town has a recently constructed boat ramp with a fee payable to Ceduna Council for its use.

Growing to in length, it is a climbing or sprawling evergreen shrub with glossy leaves and solitary, bright yellow flowers. Description The yellow flowers have been reported as having an unpleasant odour variously described as similar to mothballs or animal urine or sweet but with \\"a pronounced faecal element\\". The leaves are elliptic or obovate and average 6 cm in length. The fruits consist of segments of bright orange flesh, each surrounding a black seed. While the flesh looks attractive enough to eat, it is best not to. A minute or so after eating, the flesh produces an unpleasant burning sensation in the mouth and lips.Rainforest Seedlings Near the sea plants tend to be densely hairy with spathulate leaves and flowers with 6 or 7 carpels, while inland, the plants tend to be smoother, with flowers having 3 or 4 carpels. Taxonomy The species was first formally described in 1799 by German botanist Carl Willdenow who gave it the name Dillenia scandens. The specific epithet scandens is derived from Latin, and means \\"to climb\\". In 1805, Swedish botanist Jonas Dryander transferred the species into the genus Hibbertia. Distribution Hibbertia scandens occurs in an area that extends from south-eastern New South Wales upwards to north-east Queensland. Australasian Virtual Herbarium data show records for New Zealand and for New Guinea. Cultivation This species is cultivated as an ornamental, and adapts to a wide range of growing conditions. Although it readily grows in semi-shaded areas, it flowers best in full sun. As it is only hardy down to it requires winter protection in temperate regions. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. In popular culture Hibbertia scandens appeared on an Australian postage stamp in 1999.

Theatre Tulsa, the longest running community theatre west of the Mississippi and seventh in the nation, has had a prosperous but sometimes difficult history. The theatre has survived multiple wars, fires, and economic depressions. Theatre Tulsa started as a small community theatre that played shows in a tent, and grew to the largest community theatre in the nation in the 1970s, followed by years of decline and a recent re-invigoration that includes the new creation of a Broadway Series main stage season, a Next Stage series season composed of new works, and a Family Series season for children, families, and arts education programming. Tulsa Little Theatre was incorporated December. 10, 1922 by Mrs. Bonnie Reed and Mrs. Hope Holway. Despite the Great Depression, the group managed to raise money to build a theater which was christened with a performance of The Cradle Song in February 1932. Two years later, the group incorporated as Tulsa Little Theatre. Struggling through the next few years, the theater survived a threatened bank foreclosure in 1935 after a number of donors stepped in, and in 1940 the theater paid off its mortgage. During World War II, it produced shows for military camps and veterans‚Äô hospitals. Tulsa Little Little Theatre prospered, and by 1959 was the largest non-professional theater company in the country. In 1964, its membership was 8,000 strong. By 1972 it had the largest community theater membership in the nation and had counted 1.5 million members over the past 50 years. In 1974 Tulsa Little Theatre changed its name to Theatre Tulsa, Inc.

Though the ensemble has grown and developed to encompass an eclectic array of musical styles and genres it is rooted in Indian classical music. The origins Through Ravi Shankar's appearance at the 1969 Woodstock Festival the Paust first came in touch with Indian classical music. In 1975 Paust left Germany and travelled overland to India by car. His purpose was initially to take sitar lessons, however he soon realised that the sitar was an immensely complex instrument. Nevertheless, inspired and enchanted by the music he had encountered, Paust decided to pursue a different avenue and upon his return to Europe he immediately began organising concerts and producing records to further popularise, and introduce others to the sounds of Indian music. In 1982, Paust founded the collective Music Ensemble of Benares with which he started his first European tour. From that point forth, this ensemble has performed regularly in Europe as a more or less open unit encompassing many different musicians and various instruments. Since that time Paust has striven to bring new ideas and explore new facets of musical development. Besides presenting traditional raga and Kathak dance he has organised more experimental musical projects, most notably, between 1989 and 1994, the \\"Jazz meets India\\" sessions with jazz musicians from the USA: Paul Horn, John Handy, David Friensen et al. His latest project, since 1994, fuses Northern Indian 'Kathak Dance' and Flamenco. These unique forms possess similar elements and it is the aim of this project to further extend and explore the common roots of the two cultures.

It operated between about 1825 and 1865. General description Ram Hill Colliery was sunk sometime between 1820 and 1830. It was owned by the Coalpit Heath Company, which included Sir John Smyth as a shareholder. Sir John was one of the main proponents of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Railway, which linked the pit and others in the area to Cuckolds Pill in Bristol.Peter Lawson, Walking the Dramway, Tempus Publishing Limited, Stroud, 2006, At this date workable coal was dependent on a means of transport to market, so that the railway and the pit were interdependent. Ram Hill was 558 ft deep and was originally worked by a horse gin, the remains of which were still visible in 2006. In later years it was worked by a beam engine. The pit was linked under ground to Churchleaze and Rose Oak Pits, forming the hub of 19th century coal mining in Westerleigh parish. Abandonment Abandonment plans show that the colliery, along with other Coalpit Heath pits at Churchleaze and New Engine, closed in the 1860s as the nearby Frog Lane CollieryFrog Lane colliery increased production. In later years land in the area was purchased by the Great Western Railway for the construction of their direct route between Wootton Bassett and the Severn Tunnel via Badminton. The new line passed through the area in a deep cutting immediately north of the pit. Modern studies The site was rediscovered by local archaeologist and author John Cornwell in 1981 and has since been excavated, first by workers on a job creation scheme, and latterly by the \\"Friends of Ram Hill Colliery\\" who cleared the area of flora and removed two spoil heaps which were formed during earlier excavations. Excavation of the Ram Hill site exposed more of the railway, including stone blocks with cast iron chairs in situ and the remains of a boiler house for a steam engine. Other remains at the site included the foundations of a horse gin and the uncapped shaft of the pit. A geophysical survey, using resistivity, at Ram Hill Colliery has revealed clear traces of a reservoir in the northern corner of the site. In 2006 the Ram Hill Colliery site was designated by English Heritage as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, recognising the national importance of the site and protecting it in the future.

Sinyavsky and Daniel were convicted under the offense of anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda in a Moscow court for publishing their satirical writings of Soviet life abroad under the pseudonyms Abram Tertz and Nikolai Arzhak. The Sinyavsky‚ÄìDaniel trial was the first Soviet show trial where writers were openly convicted solely for their literary work, provoking appeals from many Soviet intellectuals and other public figures outside the Soviet Union. The Sinyavsky‚ÄìDaniel led to the Glasnost meeting, the first spontaneous public political demonstration in the Soviet Union after World War II. Sinyavsky and Daniel pled not guilty, unusual for a political charge in the Soviet Union, but were sentenced to seven and five years in strict regime Gulag labor camps, respectively. The Sinyavsky-Daniel case is widely considered to mark the end of the liberal Khrushchev Thaw period and the rise of political repression in the Soviet Union under hardliner Leonid Brezhnev, and a major starting impulse for the Soviet dissident movement.\\"Historians now have no difficulty pinpointing the birth of the modern Soviet dissident movement. It began in February 1966 with the trial of Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, two Russian writers who ridiculed the Communist regime in satires smuggled abroad and published under pen names [...] Little did they realize at the time that they were starting a movement that would help end Communist rule.\\" http://www.igrunov.ru/vin/vchk-vin-dissid/smysl/articl_diss/vchk-vin-dissid- dem_mov-speech_92.html ‚Äî –†–µ—á—å –í.–í. –ò–≥—Ä—É–Ω–æ–≤–∞ –Ω–∞ –ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∏ \\"–î–∏—Å—Å–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç—Å–∫–æ–µ –î–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –°–°–°–†. 1950-–µ ‚Äî 1980-–µ.\\"  Trial   Background  Andrei Sinyavsky, a well-known literary critic and writer in the Soviet Union, and his friend Yuli Daniel, a writer and translator, had begun sending their works to be published in the West due to strong censorship in the Soviet Union. Sinyavsky and Daniel often wrote topical stories and novellas that were satirical or critical of Soviet society, and would naturally be rejected for publication by the ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Sinyavsky and Daniel's works were smuggled out of the Soviet Union as samizdat (illegal self-published writings) to the West and published in foreign editorials under pseudonyms to protect their identities. Sinyavsky began publishing under the pen name Abram Tertz in Paris in 1959, and Daniel began publishing under the pen name Nikolai Arzhak in 1961. The publication of Daniel's This is Moscow Speaking and Sinyavsky's The Trial Begins in the West between 1959 and 1962 caught the attention of the KGB, the main security agency and secret police of the Soviet Union. Although the KGB was not familiar with the authors, they soon discovered that Arzhak, the author of This is Moscow Speaking, was the pseudonym of Yuli Daniel, and that Tertz was the pseudonym of his friend Andrei Sinyavsky. Both writers were placed under round-the-clock surveillance and their apartments were secretly searched. Information was also gathered from Sinyavsky and Daniel's colleagues acting as informants as well as KGB agents posing as neighbors' relatives. Vasili Mitrokhin, The Pathfinders (the Sinyavsky-Daniel show trial. Folder 41. The Chekist Anthology). Mitrokhin Archive from the Cold War International History Project (CWIHP). On 13 September 1965, Andrei Sinyavsky was arrested, and Yuli Daniel's arrest followed five days later. Initially, leaders of the CPSU were hesitant about prosecuting Sinyavsky and Daniel, but the trial pressed ahead under the initiative of General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, the new leader of the Soviet Union. Brezhnev personally consulted with Konstantin Fedin, the head of the Union of Soviet Writers of which Sinyavsky was an official member. Fedin, who had been criticized in an essay by Sinyavsky, urged him to make an example of the writers. On 13 January 1966, Brezhnev made the final decision to go ahead with the trial. In October 1965, Sinyavsky and Daniel's detention became publicly known when Giancarlo Vigorelli, the Secretary General of the European Community of Writers, raised the question at a meeting of the organization in Rome. In November, General Secretary of the Union of Soviet Writers Alexey Surkov admitted that the writers were in custody and gave an assurance that \\"legality\\" of the trial would be observed. The Soviet public learned of the arrest of the writers only in January 1966, three months after their arrest, when Izvestia published an article about the case entitled \\"The Turncoats\\", described Sinyavsky and Daniel as \\"were-wolves\\" and \\"renegades\\" guilty of \\"high treason\\". Referencing foreign criticism, it warned that no leniency would be shown to the defendants.  Charges  Sinyavsky and Daniel's offenses were not illegal under Soviet law, as neither publication abroad nor the use of pseudonyms were prohibited. Instead, Sinyavsky and Daniel were charged, under the recently minted Article 70 of the RSFSR Criminal Code, with the offense of anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda. The article punished Sinyavsky and Daniel's works published abroad were considered to consciously intend to subvert and weaken the Soviet system and constitute anti-Soviet progranda ‚Äì the first time that the article was applied to fiction.  Hearings  The hearings began on February 10, 1966 in Moscow City Court under chairman of the court Lev Smirnov. Sinyavsky and Daniel were not open to the public or foreign observers, and only fragments of the proceedings reached the outside world. Citing their works, the prosecution claimed Sinyaysky and Daniel had purposefully attempted to make the Soviet state look corrupt and immoral on the world stage.The works cited at the trial were Sinyavski's On Socialist Realism (1959), The Trial Begins (1960), Lyubimov (The Makepeace Experiment) (1964), as well as Daniel's This Is Moscow Speaking (1963), The Man from MINAP (1963), Hands (1966), and Atonement (1964). Green, J., Karolides, N. J. (eds.): Encyclopedia of Censorship, New York: Facts On File, 2005. p. 515 Sinyavsky's and Daniel's literary works were themselves presented as evidence. The defendants in turn claimed to be loyal Soviet citizens who wanted to strengthen the Soviet Union by eliminating remnants of Stalinist abuses. Both writers argued that accusations of \\"slander\\" cannot be applied to literary works. Sinyavsky repeatedly stated that the prosecution's line of argument eliminated the difference between an author and his characters. Unusual for political trials in the Soviet Union, both writers entered a plea of not guilty.  Sentence  On 12 February 1966, the court sentenced Yuli Daniel to five years in a strict-regime labor camp. The next day, Andrei Sinyavsky was sentenced to seven years in a strict- regime labor camp. Daniel and Sinyavsky were sent to the special labor camps for political criminals in Mordovia, with both spending time in the Dubravlag. Daniel served his five-year full term, and after his release lived in the cities of Kaluga and Moscow until his death in 1988. Sinyavsky served six years until his early release in 1971 under an initiative of Yuri Andropov, at the time Chairman of the KGB. In 1973, two years after his release, Sinyavsky emigrated to France where he became a professor of Russian literature and published numerous autobiographical and retrospective works. In 1991, the Supreme Court of the RSFSR rescinded the verdict and sentences against Sinyavsky and Daniel, and ordered the case closed for lack of the elements of a crime.  Significance and legacy   Reaction abroad  Articles in the New York Times and Le Monde as early as October 1965 profiled the case. During the hearings in February 1966, foreign correspondents waited outside the courtroom alongside Soviet citizens. Although the trial remained closed to the Western press, the defendants' wives smuggled out their own handwritten transcripts, which became some of the earliest samizdat documents to reach the West. The transcript was delivered to the bureau of Radio Liberty in Paris and passed on to the New York Times, on the theory that the news would have a greater impact if carried first by the Times than the avowedly anti-communist Radio Liberty. The trial was universally condemned in the Western media and drew criticism from public figures from around the world. PEN International as well as individual writers such as W. H. Auden, William Styron and Hannah Arendt expressed their indignation. Others who petitioned for the writers' release were Heinrich B√∂ll, G√ºnter Grass, Lillian Hellman, Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, Robert Lowell, Philip Roth, Marguerite Duras and Philip Toynbee. After Sinyavsky and Daniel's conviction, Graham Greene unsuccessfully asked for his royalties in the Soviet Union to be paid over to their wives. Criticism of the trial and sentences was also shared by socialist and communist publications in Great Britain, the United States, Italy, and France. Lifelong communist Louis Aragon published his concerns in a declaration in L'Humanit√©, and, together with Jean-Paul Sartre, subsequently refused to participate in the Tenth Congress of Soviet Writers. The Scandinavian Communist parties condemned the trial outright. In the spring of 1968, the US ambassador to the United Nations Arthur Goldberg attempted to draw the attention of the UN Human Rights Commission to the plight of the imprisoned writers, describing the trial as \\"an outrageous attempt to give the form of legality to the suppression of a basic human right.\\"Drew Middleton, U.S. Scores Trials of Soviet Writers, N.Y. Times, 7 Mar. 1968, at 1. The Soviet delegation, Iran and countries of communist and the Afro-Asian bloc secured the deletion of this speech from the records of the Commission.Drew Middleton, Soviet Wins Deletion of Most of US Charge From UN Report, N.Y. Times, 15 Mar. 1968, at 6.  Internal reaction  The proceedings were framed by denunciations in the media, headed by the newspapers Pravda, Izvestia and Literaturnaya Gazeta. The papers also published collective condemnation letters by Soviet citizens. Then-recent Nobel laureate Mikhail Sholokhov called the two writers \\"werewolves\\" and \\"thugs with a black conscience\\" who would deserve a significantly more severe punishment \\"in the memorable twenties\\".Obituary: Andrei Sinyavsky, The Independent, February 27, 1997 In response, Lidia Chukovskaya accused Sholokhov of betraying the centuries-long tradition of protecting fellow literators from unfair persecution and asserted that his \\"shameful speech will not be forgotten by History\\". Nonetheless the trial provoked protests. A letter which became known as the \\"Letter of the 63\\" (also: 62), signed by members of the USSR Union of Writers, was addressed to the presidium of the Twenty-Third Congress of the Communist Party. It argued that \\"neither learning nor art can exist if neither paradoxical ideas can be expressed nor hyperbolic images used as an artistic device.\\" The authors called for the release of the writers on bail and argued that the trial itself did more harm than the works of the writers. Among the signatories were Korney Chukovsky, Ilya Ehrenburg, Viktor Shklovsky, Venyamin Kaverin, Bella Akhmadulina, Bulat Okudzhava and Arseny Tarkovsky. * Online: * Hayward, Max: On Trial: the Soviet State versus \\"Abram Tertz\\" and \\"Nikolai Arzhak\\", Harper & Row, 1967; p. 185f. OCLC 358400 * Reprint in: On February 14, 1966, twenty-five prominent Soviet intellectuals wrote an open letter to Leonid Brezhnev, then secretary general, asking not to rehabilitate Stalinism. Among them were the academicians Andrei Sakharov, Vitaly Ginzburg, Yakov Zeldovich, Mikhail Leontovich, Igor Tamm, Lev Artsimovich, Pyotr Kapitsa and Ivan Maysky, writers Konstantin Paustovsky and Viktor Nekrasov, composer Dmitri Shostakovich, actors Innokenty Smoktunovsky, Maya Plisetskaya, Oleg Yefremov and others. The letter was widely circulated in samizdat but was never published by the official press. Some of the signers suffered repercussions such as denial to travel abroad and restrictions to officially publish their work. Several people, including Daniel's wife Larisa Bogoraz, sent independent letters in support of Sinyavsky and Daniel.  Dissident movement  Many members of the intelligentsia felt ambivalent towards the publication of works abroad, especially under a pseudonym. Nevertheless, many saw the Sinyavsky‚ÄìDaniel case as a return to the show trials of the 1930s and a sign that the Brezhnev Politburo was preparing to reverse the gains of Khrushchev's de-Stalinization. Critics of the trial protested the harsh sentences meted out to Sinyavsky and Daniel and emphasized issues of creative freedom and the historical role of the writer in Russian society. Others were troubled by the claims of the court that the trial was in full adherence to existing laws and rights guaranteed in the Soviet constitution. These concerns motivated the first unsanctioned public political demonstration in the Soviet Union after the Second World War. On Soviet Constitution Day, December 5, 1965, supporters of Sinyavsky and Daniel protested on Moscow's Pushkin Square with the call for a fair and open trial. Among the organizers of the demonstration were mathematician Alexander Esenin- Volpin, historian and poet Yuri Galanskov and student Vladimir Bukovsky. The demonstration became known as the \\"glasnost meeting\\" (–º–∏—Ç–∏–Ω–≥ –≥–ª–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏). It became an annual event in Moscow, attracting luminaries such as Andrei Sakharov. The demonstration was followed by an increase in open protest and samizdat. In 1967, journalist Alexander Ginzburg was arrested for compiling a report on the trial known as The White Book. He was sentenced to five years in a labor camp. His trial in 1968 (Galanskov-Ginzburg trial) in itself became a landmark in the Soviet human rights movement. Underground coverage of these and similar events ultimately led to the appearance of the samizdat civil rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events in April 1968. The encounter with foreign journalists during the course of the trial also helped foster a type of dissident-journalist relationship which became increasingly important to the emerging dissident movement. Through such media organs as Radio Liberty, Voice of America, the BBC, and the Deutsche Welle, samizdat materials offered to and published by Western correspondents were rebroadcast into the Soviet Union and became available to segments of the Soviet population who had no other means of learning about the movement.  Political and legal consequences  The trial of Sinyavsky and Daniel was the first Soviet show trial during which writers were openly convicted solely for their literary work.Benedikt Sarnov, Stalin and writers, (Russian: ¬´–°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω –∏ –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏¬ª), four volumes, Eksmo, Moscow, 2008‚Äî2011, IBN 978-5-699-36669-9, vol. 3, pp. 261-265Numerous writers executed during Stalinist repressions were usually falsely accused of terrorism or espionage. The trial brought to the end the period of Khrushchev's liberalism (Khrushchev Thaw), and helped to initiate the retrenchment associated with the Brezhnev's epoch (Brezhnev Stagnation). The further restrictions were achieved by an increase in arrests and persecutions as well as changes in the legal code itself. In September 1966 the Soviet legislature introduced several amendments to the RSFSR Criminal Code. Responding to the trial, in which the prosecution had found it difficult to prove the intent to do harm that was required by article 70, and to the public demonstration in support of Sinyavsky and Daniel, it added two subsections to Article 190:Berman, Harold: Soviet Criminal Law and Procedure: The RSFSR Codes, Harvard: Harvard University Press, 1972; pp. 81-83. * Article 190-1 made it a punishable offense to circulate statements defamatory of the Soviet system. In contrast to article 70, this offense did not stipulate any intention of subverting or weakening Soviet authority. * Article 190-3 prohibited violation of public order by a group, either in coarse manner or in disobedience to legal demands of representatives of authority.

Biography Henry, the son of William Henry of Lancaster and Ann Wood Henry, was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His father, an important gunsmith, apprenticed him at the age of 14 to an uncle, also a gunsmith, who moved with John Joseph to Detroit. Perhaps due to lack of business, the young man returned to Lancaster, on foot, with a guide who died in the wilderness along the way. At age sixteen he enlisted as a rifleman in the Pennsylvania state troops and marched with Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec in 1775. Taken prisoner during the ill-fated attempt to storm the city on January 1, 1776, Henry remained confined for nine months. He was confined for a time aboard HMS Pearl in New York's harbor; while imprisoned there he witnessed the Great Fire of New York.Schecter, Barnet. The Battle for New York. p. 204. He spent two years recuperating from his injuries at his father's home in Lancaster, and never healed completely. Henry began to study law and, after clerking for Stephen Chambers, a prominent Lancaster attorney, he was admitted to the bar in 1785. In 1793 he was appointed president judge of the second district of Pennsylvania. Henry married Chambers's younger sister, Jane. His will indicates that he had at least eight children: Anne-Mary, Caroline, Elisabeth, Harriet-Sidney, Amelia-Catherine, Lydia-Chambers, and Julian. The eighth and eldest, Stephen Chambers Henry, was \\"for good causes...absolutely exclude[d] and disinherit[ed]\\" in his father's will. Stephen Chambers Henry (January 4, 1786 ‚Äì August 12, 1834) earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and in 1809 moved to Detroit, where he was a surgeon during the War of 1812 and, like his father, taken prisoner. He died of cholera in 1834.John Joseph Henry, Last Will and Testament, Lancaster County Historical Society; Info on Stephen Chambers Henry also in LCHS \\"Henry\\" folder. John Joseph Henry's career as a lawyer and judge was cut short by the recurrence of the injuries that he had suffered during the march on Quebec. These injuries prevented his attendance at court, and in 1809 the legislature debated, only to reject, a petition to remove him from office. He resigned his office in January 1811. In his final years he wrote An Accurate and Interesting Account of the Hardships and Sufferings of That Band of Heroes, Who Traversed the Wilderness in the Campaign Against Quebec in 1775, published in 1812 after his death. His account of the Arnold expedition has been often quoted and frequently reprinted.  Notes   References  * Henry, John Joseph.

In 1914, he divided his playing time between the Boston Braves and Philadelphia Phillies. In a three-year career, Martin was a .237 hitter (144-for-608) with 66 runs and 43 RBI in 187 games, including 13 doubles, four triples, 20 stolen bases, and a .323 on-base percentage without home runs.

In 1954, Martin moved to Brick Township, New Jersey, where he lived out his twilight years. He was beloved and well known for helping his neighbors. In 1978 was honored by the Brick Township council for being an inspiration to youth, as the Jack Martin Boulevard is named after him. Martin suffered two heart attacks just after being introduced at the 34th annual New York Yankees Old- Timers' Day on June 21, 1980. He died 13 days later after having been hospitalized at Montefiore Hospital in The Bronx, New York.

It is managed by the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust. History The hospital, originally known as Essex County Hospital, was designed as a hospital for the treatment of tuberculosis patients and was built between June 1937 and 1940. It had \\"butterfly\\" wings that caught the sun for the benefit of the patients. During the 1960s the hospital diversified from tuberculosis treatment and dealt with more general surgery, orthopaedics and general medicine. A large outpatients clinic was also built at this time. By the early 1980s facilities included an accident and emergency department, pharmacy, rehabilitation department, operating theatres, intensive therapy unit and new specialised wards. A CT Scanner was unveiled by the Princess Royal in 1987 and she returned to open a new ward block in 1987. A new East Wing, a new Diabetic Centre and a new Medical Assessment Unit were all opened between 1998 and 1999. Further new facilities, including a new accident and emergency facility, new intensive care facilities, new theatres for day surgery, a new pathology department, a new maternity department, improved facilities for neo-natal intensive care, a new children‚Äôs department and a rooftop helipad were procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2007. The works, which were designed by Llewelyn Davies and carried out by Bouygues at a cost of ¬£180 million, were completed in 2010. The new facilities also permitted the subsequent closure of St John's Hospital in Chelmsford and the William Julien Courtauld Hospital in Braintree. Sam Penry, a diagnostic radiographer at the hospital, was awarded the \\"UK Radiographer of the Year\\" title by the Society and College of Radiographers in 2017.

It continues the trio's journey to find the seven missing gems of Deltora, braving dangers and Guardians in each book. Plot The three go on their way towards the Shifting Sands from the City of the Rats when they spot an Ak-Baba in the sky. In order to hide from it, they dive under the River Broad and hide under their cloak. Surprisingly, they are aided by the fish of the river as well, which are rather intelligent. Later, once the threat has passed, they pass by an apple farm owned by an eccentric old woman known as Queen Bee. Hungry and tired, they decide to steal and eat from the apple orchard. Queen Bee reveals that she is not actually a fragile old woman, but a dangerous threat because of the bees that she hides under her shawl. The trio are promptly chased off by her deadly bees for stealing. After some time on the road, they reach the town of Rithmere and started hearing about a competition called the Rithmere Games. Thinking they can win some money from it, they attempt to enter. But there is an entrance fee of one silver coin, and they have no money whatsoever. Lief, Jasmine, and Barda decide to let the operator of a game called Beat the Bird borrow Kree to spin the wheel thirty times, for a coin. In Beat the Bird, a bird would spin a wheel after a silver coin was paid. If the wheel lands on a number, the better is paid that number of silver coins. But if the wheel lands on a bird, the better only receives a worthless wooden bird figurine. After thirty turns, Kree senses something is amiss and pulls the table sheet, which reveals that the operator is controlling the wheel through the use of a pedal. The cheating operator then flees, leaving the coins that have fallen off the table sheet to the crowd. Lief, Barda, and Jasmine attempt to take some of the coins, but all that is left is a wooden bird. The three decided to enter the Rithmere Games when they meet a scar-faced man named Doom, who they last saw at Tom's shop. They enter the games, and discover that the \\"games\\" are in fact fighting matches. Despite this fact, they enter anyway. Lief, Jasmine, and Barda are locked in their room in the night, but Mother Brightly, the host arrives and saves them. After the fights, Jasmine manages to win the one thousand gold prize for first place. Mother Brightly tells the trio about the secret passageway that they can use to leave. However, upon trying to use it, the trio is ambushed by Grey Guards. It is revealed that there was a scandal that the prize money would be returned to Mother Brightly for the next competition while benefiting from the audience. Lief, Jasmine, and Barda attempt to make off with the coins when Doom comes to them and helps them escape. On foot, they finally reach the walls of the Shifting Sands. Lief starts to hear voices. The three hide from the Grey Guards, who are then eaten by a terrible insectile monster called a Sand Beast. Lief sees the Guards' belongings sinking into the sand and travelling to the center, in a place called the Hive. They arrive at the Hive, and Lief enters the hole full of treasures and replaces the lapis lazuli with the wooden bird to keep the structure of the piling treasures stable. He then climbs out of the Hive just before they are eaten by it. Lief fits the gem into the Belt of Deltora and their quest continues to the Dread Mountain. Characters *Lief: Lief is the main character of the series. Lief was born to parents King Endon and Queen Sharn though he believed them to be Jarred and Anna of the forge. As a child Lief roamed the streets of Del, sharpening his wits and gaining him the skills needed for his future quests. Though he did not know it, he was constantly protected by Barda and he prided himself on his many 'lucky' escapes. On his sixteenth birthday it is revealed to him that he must begin a dangerous quest to find the lost gems of the Belt of Deltora. *Barda: Barda was enlisted as a friend by the king and queen of Deltora and was trusted to help him find the lost gems of Deltora sixteen years before the initial story took place. For the next sixteen years Barda disguised himself as a beggar so as to discover information vital to the quest. He also became the bodyguard of Endon and Sharn's child Lief, albeit without the semi-arrogant Lief's knowledge thereof. Upon Lief's sixteenth birthday Barda revealed himself to Lief and the quest for the gems of Deltora began. Though Barda was at first annoyed to travel encumbered by a child, he soon saw Lief as more of a help than a hindrance. *Jasmine: Jasmine is a wild girl, described as having wild black hair (dark green hair in the anime) and emerald green eyes who has grown up in the Forests of Silence, where Lief and Barda meet her shortly after leaving Del. Her parents, Jarred and Anna, were captured by Grey Guards when she was seven years old, and so she has been raised by the forest. She can understand the language of the trees and of many animals, and has incredibly sharp senses, but has trouble understanding some social customs. Jasmine is usually seen with her blackbird, Kree, and a mouse-like creature she calls Filli. Jasmine is like Lief and occasionally has a quick temper. After helping Lief and Barda in the forest and with the help of the topaz, she is greeted by her mother's spirit from beyond the grave, who tells her to go with Lief and Barda in their quest. After this encounter, she joins Lief and Barda in the search for the great gems that will complete the Belt.
