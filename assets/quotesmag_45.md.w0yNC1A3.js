Origins and early career Born in Rouen, he was the son of a tax collector, Louis H√©rault (1645-1724), and his wife Jeanne Charlotte Guillard de la Vacherie. Ren√© H√©rault started his career in 1712, at the age of 21, as King's Advocate (a position similar to Advocate General) at the Ch√¢telet of Paris, the city's civil and criminal court. On 3 February 1718 he became Chief Prosecutor (procureur g√©n√©ral) at the Grand Conseil, a higher court of justice. He also became ma√Ætre des requ√™tes, and on 23 March 1722 he was appointed intendant of the g√©n√©ralit√© of Tours. He showed his administrative ability during a famine in his g√©n√©ralit√©, and so on 28 August 1725 he was appointed Lieutenant General of Police of Paris, i.e. head of the Paris Police, succeeding Nicolas Ravot d'Ombreval, who succeeded him as intendant of the g√©n√©ralit√© of Tours. Lieutenant General of Police of Paris As Lieutenant General of Police, Ren√© H√©rault ordered that the sewage works and refuse dumps be relocated from the city of Paris into suburbs further afield. He also initiated the practice of sprinkling streets with water during summer heat waves to prevent fires. In 1728, he ordered for the first time in History that street name signs be posted at the corner of streets. This was generalized by his decree of 30 July 1729, which demanded that all owners with houses at the beginning and end of the streets put stone tablets engraved with the street names on the exterior walls of their houses. The stone tablets were sealed within the facades. He also tried to introduce a numbering system for houses and buildings, but this failed due to opposition from the aristocracy whose members refused to have the front gate of their imposing mansions \\"disfigured\\" by number plaques. During his time in office, he was quite tough on the Jansenists, for which he was attacked virulently by the Nouvelles eccl√©siastiques, an underground newspaper which he could never close down. He notably put an end to the troubles caused by the convulsionaries of the Saint-M√©dard graveyard (a group of Jansenists claiming that miracles took place in this graveyard) in 1732. He also fought against Freemasonry which had been newly introduced to France from England. He issued an order, that tavern-keepers and restaurant-keepers were not to give accommodation to Masonic lodges at all, under penalty of being closed down for six months and assessed a fine of 3,000 livres (approx. US$15,000 in 2006). In order to discredit Freemasonry, he obtained a copy of the secret Masonic ritual from a luxury prostitute, one of whose clients was an important Freemason, and he had it published in 1737 in salacious French newspapers. Laughter from the public upon hearing of the ridiculous secret rituals was a great embarrassment for French Freemasons and significantly hindered the penetration of Freemasonry in France for several years. Ren√© H√©rault also established a large network of spies and informants in Paris and in the French provinces, and like many other Lieutenant Generals of Police of Paris in the 18th century, he was particularly disliked for his secret police. Death On 30 December 1739, Ren√© H√©rault left the Lieutenancy General of Police, where he was replaced by his son-in-law Claude-Henri Feydeau de Marville, and he was appointed intendant of the g√©n√©ralit√© of Paris and conseiller d'√âtat. He died in office on 2 August 1740 in Paris, at the age of 49. Family In 1719 Ren√© H√©rault married Marguerite Durey de Vieuxcourt (1700-1729). In 1732 he married again to H√©l√®ne Moreau de S√©chelles (1715-1798), the daughter of Jean Moreau de S√©chelles (1690-1760), then intendant of the g√©n√©ralit√© of Valenciennes, who later became Controller-General of Finances (France's Finance Minister) and gave his name to the Seychelles archipelago. Ren√© H√©rault was the grandfather of French Revolution politician Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles, son of Colonel Jean-Baptiste Martin H√©rault de S√©chelles (1737-1759), himself son of Ren√© H√©rault and his second wife H√©l√®ne Moreau de S√©chelles. Most authors, however, consider that Ren√© H√©rault was not the actual biological grandfather of Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles. The real biological grandfather was Louis Georges √ârasme de Contades (1704-1793), Marshal of France, who had an affair with H√©l√®ne Moreau de S√©chelles during her marriage to Ren√© H√©rault, and who later took care of Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles after the early death of his father at the Battle of Minden in 1759 where Contades was commanding the French army. Ren√© H√©rault was also the grandfather of the famous Duchess of Polignac, friend and confidante of Queen Marie Antoinette. The Duchess of Polignac was the daughter of Jeanne Charlotte H√©rault (1726-1753 or 1756), herself the daughter of Ren√© H√©rault and his first wife. Finally, the other daughter of Ren√© H√©rault and his first wife, Louise Ad√©la√Øde H√©rault (1722-1754), was married by her father in 1738 to Claude-Henri Feydeau de Marville, who succeeded Ren√© H√©rault as Lieutenant General of Police of Paris in 1739.

Korting graduated with an M.D. from the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in 1977, and subsequently was trained in medical microbiology at central medical services units of the German Army (Bundeswehr) until 1979. Thereupon he was trained as a dermatologist at the Department of Dermatology and Allergology of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (Germany). In 1985 he obtained his post- doctoral degree (Habilitation). He has been working there ever since, lastly as a professor and Executive Academic Director. The focus of his scientific activities was on the characterization of the development of localized fungal infections of the skin and related mucosal surfaces. He concentrated on secreted aspartic proteases of Candida albicans as virulence factors and toll- like receptors as relevant mediators of the inflammatory host response. It was his prime concern to develop active pharmaceutical ingredients for the treatment and prevention of fungal infections reflecting the increased understanding of pathogenesis. In particular, it was intended to address virulence factors rather than structure and function of the pathogen cell wall according to the motto \\"targeting virulence: a new paradigm for antifungals\\". Moreover, he was interested in the development of new biological drugs such as plasmin as well as small molecules which are capable of influencing inflammation in the context of signal transduction such as sphingosine-1-phosphate. In addition, there now was a focus on small molecules modulating the function of human polymerase alpha which at a time modulates proliferation of keratinocytes and various viruses including human papilloma viruses (HPV), which is most relevant in the context of non-melanoma skin cancer treatment. Korting was the recipient of several scientific awards, including the Paul Gerson Unna Prize from the German Dermatological Society as well as the prize for promotion of research of Deutschsprachige Mykologische Gesellschaft. He sat on the board of several scientific societies including Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft (DDG) and was a co-founder of the Society for Dermopharmacy. From 2006 to 2012 he was a member of the board of the Working Group of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF). He also edited or co-edited a variety of biomedical journals including Mycoses, The International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, The American Journal of Clinical Dermatology as well as Hautarzt and JDDG (Journal of the German Society of Dermatology).

He studied the history of standard languages in the Slavic region, especially Croatian. He was an active Esperantist since 1946, and wrote Esperanto poetry as well as translated works into the language.Pleadin, Josip (2002). \\"Biografia leksikono de kroatiaj esperantistoj\\" (in Esperanto). ƒêurƒëevac: Grafokom. Life and career He was born in Sarajevo and went to primary school in Zenica. Then he went to comprehensive secondary schools in Visoko, Sarajevo and Zagreb. He received a BA degree in the Croatian language and Yugoslav literatures at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb. In 1957, he received his Ph.D. with the thesis Speech in the Fojnica Valley. Brozoviƒá worked as an assistant at the Zagreb Theater Academy (1952‚Äì1953) and as a lecturer at the University of Ljubljana (until 1956). He subsequently went to the Faculty of Philosophy in Zadar, becoming an associate professor (1956), docent (1958), extraordinary (1962) and full (1968-1990) professor. In 1969 he worked as a visiting professor at the University of Michigan, and since 1971 at the University of Regensburg. In 1975 he became an associate, and in 1977 extraordinary, and in 1986 full member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. Since 1986 he was an external member of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and since 1991 of the Academia Europaea. Since 1946 he was a member of the Communist Party. In the late 1980s, he was a co-founder and vice-president of the Croatian Democratic Union, which would win the 1990 elections. According to Croatian national television documentary ‚ÄúWar before war‚Äù, he was informer of Yugoslavian secret service (SDS) and operated under code name ‚ÄúForum‚Äù until early 1990. He was the vice-president of the presidency of the Republic of Croatia (in 1990) and a member of the Croatian Parliament (1992-1995). In the period 1991-2001 he headed the Miroslav Krle≈æa Lexicographical Institute. He edited the Atlas of European and Slavic Dialectology. Linguistic importance Brozoviƒá has been described as one of the most influential Croatian linguists of the 20th century. However, this view is given from an extremely nationalist perspective, as Brozoviƒá was known to often abandon linguistics for an extremely nationalist discourse. (CROLIB). (NSK). (FFZG) Among his main works are the book Standardni jezik (\\"Standard Language\\") (1970) and the article \\"Hrvatski jezik, njegovo mjesto unutar ju≈ænoslavenskih i drugih slavenskih jezika, njegove povijesne mijene kao jezika hrvatske knji≈æevnosti\\" (\\"Croatian Language, Its Place among the South Slav and Other Slav Languages, Its Historical Changes as the Language of Croatian Literature\\") (1978). The former gives a typology of standard languages, which however meets criticism for containing disputable and vague criteria. The latter divides the history of the Croatian language into three pre-standard and three standard periods. Whereas it was widely believed that Croatian was only standardized around the time of the Illyrian movement and Ljudevit Gaj, Brozoviƒá argued that the standardization began around 1600 and greatly developed around 1750. However, this Brozoviƒá's article also faces criticism due to the fact that \\"in the 18th century, there was no standard language (‚Äô√ºberdachende‚Äô sprachliche Entit√§t), which would roof Kajkavian and Shtokavian\\".\\"da es eine das Kajkavische und ≈†tokavische ‚Äô√ºberdachende‚Äô sprachliche Entit√§t im 18. Jh. nicht gegeben hat\\" () In other words, the major standardization activities took place only in the 19th century. Brozoviƒá was one of the authors of the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language, an influential programmatic statement against Yugoslavian linguistic unitarianism from a Croatian nationalist perspective. Two years before Declaration, Brozoviƒá denied the existence of Yugoslavian linguistic unitarism: \\"for Croato-Serbian language as language, as linguistic phenomenon, as language in the Slavic family, there has been no need to unify: it has always been a unity\\".\\"hrvatskosrpski jezik kao jezik, kao lingvistiƒçki fenomen, kao jedan od jezika slavenske porodice, nije ni trebalo izjednaƒçivati: on je oduvijek bio jedan\\" () Retrospectively, west European scientists judge the Yugoslav language policy as an exemplary one. It turned out that the Deklaracija was the work of the secret police of Yugoslavia (UDBA) and that Brozoviƒá was a member of the UDBA under the pseudonym \\"Forum\\". Instead of Serbo-Croatian, Brozoviƒá preferred the term Central South Slavic diasystem,Deset teza o hrvatskom jeziku, Zagreb, 1971, published in: *Susreti 6, Zbornik radova sa susreta hrvatskih studenata u tuƒëini (1981-1986), Zagreb- Bochum, 1986, str. 136-145, under title O kljuƒçnim pitanjima hrvatskoga knji≈æevnog jezika *the book Stjepan Babiƒá: Hrvatski jezik u politiƒçkom vrtlogu, 1990, str. 271-283, under title Deset teza o hrvatskome jeziku, *the two editions of Deklaracija o hrvatskome jeziku, Matica hrvatska, Zagreb 1991. *Hrvatska revija *Journal of Croatian Studies asserting separate language status for Croatian and Serbian. However, Brozoviƒá advocated the term \\"Croato-Serbian\\" even in 1988. As far as language status is concerned, Brozoviƒá has asserted for nearly three decades that \\"the Serbian and Croatian variants are (...) phenomenons, which are analogous to the English and American variants\\";\\"srpska i hrvatska varijanta predstavljaju [...] fenomene analogne engleskoj i ameriƒçkoj varijanti\\" () \\"As in other cases where several nations use one standard language (German, Dutch, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese as standard languages), the standard Croato- Serbian language is not unified. In linguistics (especially in sociolinguistics), the realizations of such standard languages are called variants of a standard language\\".\\"Kao i u drugim sluƒçajevima kada se jednim standardnim jezikom slu≈æi vi≈°e nacija (njemaƒçki, nizozemski, engleski, francuski, ≈°panjolski, portugalski standandardni jezik), standardni hrvatskosrpski jezik nije jedinstven. Realizacijski oblici takvih standardnih jezika nazivaju se u lingvistici (prvenstveno u sociolingvistici) varijantama standardnog jezika\\" () Brozoviƒá maintained that it is \\"a fact that Serbs and Croats have a common language\\",\\"ƒçinjenica da Srbi i Hrvati imaju zajedniƒçki jezik\\" () and he described it as pluricentric even in 1992. In the 1990s, Brozoviƒá became one of the leading proponents of linguistic purism in Croatia. Brozoviƒá states that the list of 100 words of the basic Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin vocabulary, as set out by Morris Swadesh, shows that all 100 words are identical. According to Swadesh, at least twenty words must differ if they are to be considered as different languages. Brozoviƒá received the Zadar City Award for a prominent scientific activity (for the book Standardni jezik) in the 1970, and an Award for Life's Work of the Republic of Croatia in 1992.

It is based on Hugh Fleetwood's novel The Order of Death, with a screenplay by Fleetwood, Faenza and Ennio de Concini. The music was composed by Ennio Morricone. The plot follows a psychological cat-and-mouse game between a corrupt police officer (Keitel) and a disturbed young man (Lydon) against the backdrop of a rash of serial killings, The film was shot on-location in New York City and at Cinecitt√† Studios in Rome between March and April, 1982. It is Lydon's only starring role in film to date. Upon release, it received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, and has since fallen into the public domain. It has since undergone a reevaluation, and has become a cult classic due to the presence of Keitel and Lydon, while being acknowledged as a precursor to Abel Ferrara's similarly-themed Bad Lieutenant (1992).Six Pack: John Lydon 01-31-2018, Rhino.com  Plot  Corrupt NYPD narcotics detectives Fred O'Connor and Bob Carvo have spent their illegal earnings on a Park Avenue apartment, viewing it as a sort of long-term investment. However, friction starts forming between them, as Carvo feels guilty about their scams and wants to abandon their association, asking O'Connor to pay him his share of the apartment so he can sell it, despite O'Connor's reluctance. Carvos's wife Lenore, a journalist critical of the police and a former fling of O'Connor's, begins to suspect her ex-partner's corruption, but is unable to prove it. O'Connor begins to notice a stalker, a young man with tinted sunglasses who follows him to and from his secret apartment. After several confrontations on the street, the young man confronts O'Connor inside the apartment, claiming to be the perpetrator of a string of murders against members of the Narcotics Division, dubbed by the media as the \\"Copkiller\\". O'Connor quickly dismisses the young man's assertions due to his small stature and apparent physical weakness, quickly overpowering and subduing him. The seemingly disturbed man gives his name as Fred Mason, but O'Connor is unable to match the name to any on-record description. Mason threatens to go to the authorities about O'Connor's apartment, thereby exposing his corruption. An equally culpable Carvo insists on letting Mason go, and O'Connor seemingly agrees, paying Carvo his share of the apartment. In fact, O'Connor keeps Mason captive in his apartment bathroom, binding him and reinforcing the door with an external deadbolt. Hoping to intimidate Mason into keeping silent, he tries to garner him into revealing details about his personal life, but a seemingly insolent Mason refuses to cooperate. Mason claims that his wealthy grandmother is looking for him, and his discovery and O'Connor's exposure is inevitable. Based on news reports, O'Connor determines that Mason's real name is Leo Smith, and tracks down his grandmother Margaret on Staten Island. Margaret, a wealthy heiress, tells him that Leo came under her care after his parents sudden death, but felt guilty about the wealth he was now entitled to, and developed a self-loathing complex that led him to compulsively confess to heinous crimes he had no involvement in, seeking retribution over his self- inflicted guilt. O'Connor uncovers a secret tape recording by Leo that states his intention to confront O'Connor, thus revealing his location. O'Connor returns to the apartment and destroys the incriminating tape, but is confronted by Carvo who has become wise to his scheme. Holding him at gunpoint, Carvo demands he release Leo, but O'Connor responds by striking him and knocking his head on a nearby toilet seat. Telling Leo that he's still alive, he unties him and orders him to help transport his unconscious body to Central Park. Reiterating Leo's earlier claim to be the Copkiller, O'Connor orders him at gunpoint to slit Carvo's throat and kill him, making his death look like another one of the Copkiller's victims. Leo insists that he has never killed anyone, but eventually relents, only for O'Connor to pull the trigger. The gun misfires, and Leo takes the opportunity to escape on foot. O'Connor realizes that his partner's gun was unloaded. O'Connor goes to work the next day wrought with guilt and paranoia, as investigators are baffled by the unusual circumstances of Carvo's death. Upon returning to the apartment, he is confronted by Leo. As Leo was seen fleeing the scene of the murder, he is now suspected as either a witness or accomplice. With little recourse, O'Connor allows Leo to stay in his apartment indefinitely. O'Connor's mental state further deteriorates as he descends into alcoholism, seeking comfort in the presence of Lenore, who still has feelings for him after her husband's death. Leo meanwhile, sneaks out of the apartment to purchase a serrated knife identical to the one used by the Copkiller, and hides it in O'Connor's kitchen. Leo angrily chastises O'Connor for seeing Lenore, claiming that his feelings of guilt make a confession to her unavoidable. The two plot to murder her, Leo goading him by threatening to go the police. While O'Connor goes to Lenore's house, Leo dresses as a picture of his father and retrieves a hidden gym bag from a subway station locker. At her apartment, O'Connor is unable to go through with Lenore's murder. He gives her Carvo's gun and confesses to the secret arrangement between the two, while falsely claiming that the apartment is far away from Central Park. Upon returning to the apartment, a disheveled O'Connor finds the phone line cut and Leo bound and gagged in the bathtub. Untying him and trying to find the intruder in the house, he's instead confronted by a grieved Lenore who berates him for lying to her and accuses him of killing Carvo. Leo emerges and claims that O'Connor is the Copkiller and held him hostage, and planned to kill both him and Lenore. She goes outside to call the police, while Leo reveals himself as the true Copkiller, having manipulated the corrupt O'Connor from the very beginning to frame him. He gives O'Connor the knife and tells him to finish it, before dumping his killing paraphernalia from his gym bag into the closet. With nowhere to run, O'Connor slits his own throat just as a horrified Lenore and police backup burst in. He collapses to the floor dead, and a poker-faced Leo stares out at the skyline.

Since then, this rarely seen film has become part of the public domain. Because there is no true owner of the footage, scores of bad-quality copies are floating around the market. Some few legitimate copies of the film were released in a mid-1980s VHS by Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment under the title Corrupt. Several imprints with the title Cop Killer or Copkiller are poorly made transfers and there has been no official DVD release either; most of the copies in this format are badly edited and sourced from the same VHS that came out in the 1980s. The film is marketed under various titles, including The Order of Death or Order of Death (mostly in the United Kingdom), Corrupt in USA, Cop Killer or Cop Killers in Europe, Bad Cop Chronicles #2: Corrupt (from the VHS sleeve, part of the video series Bad Cop Chronicles) and Corrupt Lieutenant. The latter was devised after 1992 to capitalize on Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant, a critically acclaimed film also featuring Harvey Keitel.  Reception  Copkiller was reviewed on BBC 1's Film 83 as Order of Death. Well-known British film critic Barry Norman refers to Lydon's voice as a ‚Äúspeak-your-weight machine\\", and sums up by calling the movie \\"stupid\\". In the book Harvey Keitel Movie Top Ten edited by Creation Books in 1999 and compiled by film author Jack Hunter, featuring his personal \\"Top Ten\\" of Keitel's best films or performances, there is a chapter dedicated to Copkiller. The chapter is written by film critic David Prothero, who describes the film as \\"undoubtedly one of Kietel's finest films\\". Prothero makes the link between Keitel's character in the film and his character in Bad Lieutenant. Another comparison he brings is the parallel relation between Copkiller and Lydon's role with the relation drawn from the film Performance and Mick Jagger's role there; Prothero describes the blurring of Lydon's stage persona with his onscreen character, stating that defining proofs about this hypothesis are Leo Smith's tantrums ala Johnny Rotten, his mixture of arrogance and cynicism and the fact that Lydon wears his own clothes throughout the film.  Influence   Bad Lieutenant  Harvey Keitel's portrayal of a corrupt cop has been pointed out as a prototype of his subsequent character of The Lieutenant in the cult classic film Bad Lieutenant, because of their similarities; particularly in the depiction of self-blame. In the aforementioned chapter of Harvey Keitel Movie Top Ten, by David Prothero, this comparison is mentioned.  Public Image Ltd  John Lydon's Post-punk group Public Image Ltd (PiL) was supposed to score the soundtrack for the film and worked on the material with his band mates Keith Levene and Martin Atkins (over the phone, by long distance). In early November 1982 PiL announced the imminent release of a new single, Blue Water, and a six-track mini album, You Are Now Entering A Commercial Zone, on their new label, which was supposed to release the unused music for Copkiller. This did not happen, with the band instead continuing to record a full-length album at South Park Studios. In mid-1983 in PiL's absence, Keith Levene took the unfinished album tapes and did his own mix. He then flew over to London and presented them to Richard Branson as the finished new PiL album for Virgin Records: Commercial Zone. For his part, John Lydon decided to completely abandon the tapes and re-record the whole album from scratch with session musicians. This new version of Commercial Zone became This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get in 1984. The classic new wave song The Order of Death from This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get is a reference to the film. The line \\"This is what you want... This is what you get\\", which gives his title to the album, appears in The Order of Death.

This incident sparked debate over freedom of religion in India and the government decided to introduce anti-conversion legislation. Conversion Meenakshipuram is a village in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu, India. The scheduled caste members in the village were segregated by the caste, who referred to them as untouchables on the basis of the Indian caste system. The district had a long history of caste-related violence. An estimated of 1,100 scheduled caste members from the village had converted to Islam. Though originally 220 families were registered for conversions, about 40 of them changed their mind and 180 families attended the ceremony held on 19 February 1981. Aftermath After the incident, the Tamil Nadu government set up an inquiry commission to investigate the conversion. The commission in its report suggested an anti-conversion bill to be passed by the state government, but government put it on hold. Media reported that the conversion took place by force using foreign funding. While some converts denied the allegations, others said that they had been bribed. Ayyappan, a resident of Meenakshipuram, said that he had declined an offer of Rs. 500 in cash to convince him to renounce his faith. One news paper had also printed a photo of a currency note from a Gulf country. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was reportedly unhappy, and Home Minister Zail Singh questioned if \\"a conspiracy or political motivation\\" was involved in these conversions. A number of press reporters and politicians such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Yogendra Makwana visited the village. Many of the converts left Islam later on. By July 1981, some of the converts returned to Hinduism. In 1991, a decade later, 900 out of 1,100 converts returned to Hinduism, citing the lack of fulfillment of promises made during the conversions.

McHale is located in the West of Ireland in the town of Ballinrobe, which is approximately 40 km North of Galway City. McHale manufacture numerous products including Integrated Baler Wrappers, Balers, Wrappers, Bale Handling Equipment, Shear Grabs and Bale Splitters.  History  In 1970 the firm started off as McHale Farm Machinery, a retail farm machinery dealership, which is still in existence today. In the early 1980s McHale Engineering was founded by brothers Padraic and Martin McHale. The reason for forming this firm was that the brothers saw a need for machinery to cut silage in the West of Ireland. At the time machines, which were being imported, found it hard to deal with the grass type in the area. As a result, the brothers decided to design a machine, which would do a better job. The firm's range of machinery would be better equipped and sturdier for the rugged Irish conditions. The first product was a Silomac Blockcutter. A range of slurry pumping equipment followed this. The late 1980s saw McHale manufacture its first round Balewrapper and take the brave step to specialise in this area. In the early years a lot of time was spent developing this product in line with end user requirements. The company subsequently developed a range of round bale wrappers for field and static wrapping. McHale saw that the future in agriculture lay in the round and square bale markets. McHale established a dealer network in the UK and also began to export machines to Europe in 1990 which was to lead to McHale's rapid future expansion. In 1994 McHale expanded beyond Europe and the first machines were exported to Australia. By now, McHale was becoming a market leader and recognised name in the market. McHale produced their first square bale wrapper in 1995. It was launched on the market. From here the company developed a range of Square wrappers for field and static wrapping. McHale actively began to pursue the New Zealand Market in 1996. However machine had been working here since the early 1990s when customers had imported them from Europe proving that the machines were highly regarded throughout the world. In 1999 McHale build a purpose built production facility to cope with the increased demand for its product. McHale entered the baler market in 2000 with the introduction of a combined baler wrapper the McHale Fusion. This machine consisted of a heavy-duty baler with an integrated wrapping ring. The machine had a patented bale transfer which gives a positive transfer and a number of key selling points. One such key selling point was the elimination of the need for a second tractor and operator for wrapping the bales. McHale developed a fixed chamber baler (the McHale F550) from the Fusion design two years later in 2004. This baler shares 85% of the components of the Fusion. McHale provide a considerable amount of employment in the West of Ireland.  McHale Today  McHale integrated wrapper McHale Engineering now exports 90% of its equipment to over 44 different countries across five continents. McHale has ISO9002 accreditation and has made significant investments in the latest production technology - CNC laser cutting equipment, robotic welders and the latest CAD - CAM design and manufacturing systems.

The Big Bend region of Florida, United States, is an informal region of the state. Different definitions of the region include counties stretching across northern Florida from the Apalachicola River to the St. Johns River. The Big Bend Coast, however, is the marshy coast without barrier islands that extends along the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida from the Ocklockonee River (Wakulla County) to Anclote Key (Pasco County). Visit Florida, the state's official tourism marketing corporation, uses varying definitions of the region, including just four counties, Jefferson, Taylor, Dixie and Levy counties, in one definition, and 12 counties, including Levy, Dixie, Gilchrist, Lafayette, Suwannee, Columbia, Hamilton, Baker, Union, Bradford, Clay, and Putnam counties, in another. The Big Bend Scenic Byway is a marked route through Franklin, Leon, and Wakulla counties. Private agencies that self-identify as serving the Big Bend region often include Franklin, Gadsden, Jefferson, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Taylor and Wakulla counties in their service areas.. The principal city in the region is Tallahassee. The Big Bend Coast is the marshy coast extending about from the mouth of the Ocklockonee River around Apalachee Bay and down the west coast of peninsular Florida to Anclote Key. This stretch of coast includes the coasts of Wakulla, Jefferson, Taylor, Dixie, Levy, Citrus, Hernando and Pasco counties. The Big Bend Coast is a drowned karst region, covered with salt marsh. It includes freshwater springs, oyster reefs, and the delta of the Suwannee River. There are barrier islands west of the Oklockonee River and south starting with Anclote Key, but there are no barrier islands between those places. The Big Bend Coast has little or no sand or mud. The karst topography has produced an irregular, frequently exposed, bedrock surface. Due to the width of the adjacent continental shelf (over ), low gradient slope of the coast (1:5000), and shelter from the usual wind direction of storms, the Big Bend Coast is generally subject to low wave energy.

These mycobacteria are collectively referred to as mycolactone-producing mycobacteria or MPM. In humans, mycolactone is the toxin responsible for Buruli ulcers, doing so by damaging tissues and inhibiting the immune response. Variants Five distinct, naturally occurring mycolactone structural variants have been described so far: * Mycolactone A/B (M. ulcerans from Africa, Malaysia, Japan * Mycolactone C (M. ulcerans from Australia) * Mycolactone D (M. ulcerans from China) * Mycolactone E (M. liflandii from Sub- Saharan Africa) * Mycolactone F (M. pseudoshottsii and M. marinum from around the world)  Biosynthesis  Mycolactone consists of a 12-membered macrolide core with an ester-linked polyketide chain. Three plasmid-encoded polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes are responsible for its production: MLSA 1 and MLSA 2 which generate the core, and MLSB is responsible for the synthesis of the polyketide chain. As shown in Figure 1, MLSB (1.2 MDa) contains seven consecutive extension modules and MLSA 1 (1.8 MDa) consists of eight. The remaining PKS enzyme, MLSA 2, contains the ninth module of MLSA. The C-terminal domains of both MLSA2 and MLSB includes a thioesterase (TE) that was thought to catalyze the formation of the mycolactone core but appears inactive. Each module consists of either malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA Acyltransferase (AT) that allows for chain extension, a ketosynthase (KS), which catalyzes chain elongation, and an Acyl carrier protein (ACP) where the growing polyketide chain is attached. Modules may also consist of any of the following modifying domains: a dehydratase (DH), an enoyl reductase (ER) and one of two types of ketoreductase (KR) domains. Type A and B KRs refer to the two directions of ketoreduction that are correlated with specific amino acids in the active site. Four of the DH domains are predicted to be inactive based on a point mutation found in the active site sequence. Figure 1. Domain Organization of Mycolactone.

He was a meticulous craftsman and went to a great deal of effort to ensure that his illustrations were accurate. He illustrated six or seven books a year in addition to a huge volume of magazine illustration. Early life He was born in Banstead, the younger son of notable book illustrator Hablot Knight Browne (who as \\"Phiz\\" illustrated books by Charles Dickens). He was privately educated and then studied art at the Heatherley School of Fine Art and South Kensington Schools. At Art School he insisted only drawing from life. Work Browne worked in watercolour and pen and ink. He was a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours (RI) and a founder member of the Royal Society of British Artists (RBA). Browne was an early member of the Society of Graphic Art and showed three works at their first exhibition in 1921. Some sources say that Browne began accepting commissions when still a student as money was in short supply at home as his father had been unwell in 1867 and was partly incapacitated by illness. However, Kirkpatrick considers this unlikely as Browne was only 9 years of age in 1867, and that his earlies known illustrations only appeared in 1875. Brown's first book illustrations was for The Day After the Holidays (1875), A school story by Ascott R Hope. This inaugurated numerous commissions for books and for contributions to periodicals. Among these was work for Aunt Judy's Magazine He then drew several Christmas cards and took a course in drawing on wood. James Cooper, his tutor, introduced him to Blackie's, the London publishers, for whom he began to illustrate juvenile books. The first book he illustrated for Blackie was Facing Death: The Hero of the Vaughan Pit (1882) by G. A. Henty. From the 1880s, Browne was one of Britain's most prolific illustrators. Houfe says that Browne illustrated a truly amazing quantity of boy's stories, tales and novels. His total volume of work was enormous. Kirkpatrick gives the estimate that Browne produce c. 3,660 images in his work. Browne also wrote himself. He exhibited his work extensively with over 200 works exhibited during his life (a few of these may have been repeated at different venues). Book illustration Browne illustrated six or seven books a year. His historical research for his illustrations was painstaking. He assembled a collection of armour, helmets, pistols, daggers, swords, uniforms, and even saddles. When working, he would refer to these constantly to ensure his depictions of historic dress and arms were accurate. Browne took great care that he understood the text he was illustrating. He would read the text first, and then read it again to identify the details of the scene to be illustrated. Such was Browne's renown for his careful research that George Bernard Shaw, in a review of Stories of Old Renown by Ascot R. Hope said: Mr. Hope describes Guy of Warwick as unhorsed, and fighting the dragon with his sword after he has been thrown and has lost his spear. Mr. Gordon Browne's illustration shows Guy on horseback fighting with his sword. Which is right? Example of book illustration Browne illustrated fourteen of G. A. Henty's novels, including the first seven published by Blackie and Son. One of these was \\"Facing Death: The Hero of the Vaughan Pit: A Tale of the Coal Mines.\\" This was first published by Blackie in 1882 with six drawings by Gordon Browne. A second version of the first edition was published in the same year, but this time with eight illustrations as shown here.

The cause of death was heart failure. His effects totalled ¬£426 17s 9d. Assessments of Gordon Browne Despite his talent, Browne never achieved the critical acclaim accorded to some of his contemporaries. Enormously painstaking and highly talented, he failed to equal the fame of his father only because his work appeared too widely and in cheap editions, so that he never became associated with a single significant author. Peppin and Micklethwait agree that his failure to achieve the famed of his father was due partly to him never becoming the lead illustrator for any author of note, and also because much of his vast output was published in very cheap editions. However, they concluded that on the grounds of energy, competence, reliability, and sheer volume he must be rated among the most important illustrators of his time. Doyle concludes that: Gordon Browne's work over the years was so varied and full, so skilled, and of such a consistently high standard that praise would seem invidious. He was equally at home with character-drawing, action scenes or placid landscapes. His animals were as convincing as his people and his children were realistic and vigorous. Houfe is less complimentary, and states that: He was clearly an artist who pleased editors and in this way there is a sameness about his work which dulls it: characters look very much alike whether they are Besant's or Henty's Kirkpatrick reports that James Thorp, in English Illustration: The Nineties (1935) says that: if he failed to achieve greatness it was due to the monotonous sameness of many of his illustrations, particularly in facial character... Sketchley said that: ... on the whole, the stores illustrated by Gordon Browne are adequately illustrated. and goes on to say that he illustrates more from reality than from the imagination, and that his ideas of fairyland... are no less brisk and picturesque than are his ideas of everyday and of romance. Nevertheless, she concluded that his style It is a healthy style, the ideals of beauty and of strength are never coarse, wanton or listless, the humour is friendly, and if the pathos occasionally verges on sentimentality, the writer, perhaps, rather than the artist is responsible. Dalby wrote Gordon Browne was one of the greatest illustrators of the Golden Age, both in terms of quality and quantity. His sheer prolificity, averaging six books a year for nearly half a century, may have undervalued his reputation, but there is no doubt his innumerable vivid and painstakingly accurate drawings were always successful and much liked by generations of children addicted to the perennially popular classics he illustrated. Many late Victorian writers, from Mrs Ewing to Henty and Fenn, were delighted to have their stories illustrated by this most felicitous of artists. Notes  References  * Carpenter, H. and M.

The show was based on the British and American versions of the game, and was originally knowned simply as Catch Phrase until 1999 where the show was renamed as Burgo's Catch Phrase In honour of its host, John Burgess. The show was cancelled in 2003 after a revamp of the show and a hiatus in 2001. Contestants would have to identify the familiar phrase represented by a piece of animation, with the show's mascot -- a character called \\"Jimmy\\" -- often appearing. In the original run, two contestants played in each game, but in the 2002 revamp, this was increased to three. The Main Game In the main game, at the start of each round, one contestant stopped a randomizer which consisted of money amounts by hitting his/her button. The value that was landed would then be the amount for the normal catch phrases. On each normal catch phrase, the computer would draw it on the screen. When it was done, a bell would ring, signifying the contestants to buzz-in when they think they know the answer. A regular catch phrase could be worth $20-$75 in the first round, $40-$100 in round two, and $75-$150 in round three A correct answer won the contestant the predetermined money amount, plus a chance to solve the Bonus Catch Phrase which was hidden behind nine squares with the show's logo on each. To choose a square, the contestant had to hit their button to stop a randomizer from flashing around the board after which the square was revealed, and they had a chance to guess. A correct answer won bonus money for the player ($100 for the first round, $200 for the second round and $300 for the third round.) Also, each round's Bonus Catch Phrase offered a minor prize hidden behind a mystery square. In the 2002 revival, if in the second round, the Bonus Catch Phrase was solved after 5 squares or less, another round worth $200 was played. Also, there was a mystery Cash Prize of $200 in one game, which increased by $200 the next day if it was not won. After three rounds, the player with the most money won the game and played the Super Catch Phrase. Super Catch Phrase The final round involved a game board (5 by 5 grid) with 25 lettered squares (A-Y) with catchphrases hidden behind each. The winning contestant had the task to capture five squares in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line within 60 seconds. Prizes were won if successful, with a larger prize if the winning player used the central \\"M\\" square. It is possible to win both prizes if two lines were made, where one line did went through the \\"M\\" square and the other line didn't go through the \\"M\\" square. From their fifth winning show onwards, champions could win a car by completing a line through the \\"M\\" square. For three seasons, the M square displayed the logo of the manufacturer providing the car. Originally, the square was marked with the VW logo of Volkswagen Group, but later changed to the stylized \\"H\\" logo of Hyundai Motor Group. During this period, which ended following the penultimate series, in order to play the puzzle in the center square the contestant had to call out the name of the sponsor of the square (either \\"VW\\" or \\"Hyundai\\"). Winning the car at any point retired the champion immediately with whatever he/she had won to that point. Otherwise, the champion played until being defeated.

But after 1992, the Egyptian government started to implement a development plan when it started to build some settlements, including 500 new houses built in Shalateen and 250 in Aboramad and Halayib, depending on Shalateen local council sources. Roads were also established, including a 250-kilometer road between Shalateen and Marsa Alam city in north, and three new electricity generators have begun operation since 1993. In 1993‚Äì94, the Egyptian government launched a plan for the social economic development of the area. Services and economic support were delivered in the main towns and villages and necessary infrastructures was built. Financial and in-kind donations were sponsored for a total amount of 1.5 billion L.E. currently; the government is supporting local families with 70 L.E. per month, and 3 L.E. per day to each child going to school. Nowadays many highly educated people, and many local people, work as employees of the government, NGOs and private sector companies. Depending on that and on the government development policy, many people from the mountains moved to towns in order to benefit from these services. They were given houses with a permanent water source, food supplies, electricity and education. So far, approximately 8,000 people have settled along the coast. As a result of the plan, communities in the urban areas have improved their livelihood. The local community in Halayib area has been involved in the management of Gabal Elba Protected Area as guides and also as environmental researchers in the management and conservation of the natural resources of this area; local people are also involved in the decision-making process. The World Food Program project in this area \\"Support Bedouin Life Project\\" represents a good model for the Egyptian government's policy of local participation and community-based management of projects.

A. Torrey who had come to Los Angeles to start a Bible institute (now known as Biola University) similar to Moody Bible Institute. The church was to be strictly non-denominational, though Evangelical. Its purpose was to reach the lost of Los Angeles, which was reflected in the name based on two passages of Scripture: John 10:9 and Revelation 3:8. Other pastors have included Louis T. Talbot (1932‚Äì1948) and J. Vernon McGee (1949‚Äì1970). The current Pastor is David Anderson. In 1915 Torrey announced plans to organize an independent church that would meet in Biola's auditorium called the Church of the Open Door. This decision proved controversial with local Presbyterian and Baptist clergy. For 70 years the church was located in downtown Los Angeles on Hope Street and 6th St. (536 South Hope St.). It relocated to Glendora, California in 1985. thumb The original church building was located in downtown Los Angeles and was demolished in the late 1980s. Despite efforts led by the late William Eugene Scott to prevent the building from being sold to developers and to have the building saved as a historic landmark, the building could not be saved. It was so damaged in the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake that it was declared unsafe and the cost of repairs deemed prohibitive. One of the two historic \\"Jesus Saves\\" signs from the original building can now be seen atop the Ace Hotel Los Angeles. It was relocated there by the late William Eugene Scott who took it with him when his church (Los Angeles University Cathedral) relocated following the earthquake. Glendora When the church moved to Glendora in 1985, it purchased land from Azusa Pacific University. It is still a thriving congregation, with about 500 worshipers every Sunday. David Anderson is the current Senior Pastor, with David Schaller serving as Associate Pastor and David Newkirk serving as Next Generation Pastor. There are two services every Sunday at 9:00 and 10:45 a.m. in the Worship Center, which is located just South of the gym. A variety of Sunday School classes are available, including ones for adults, and ones for children and teenagers. HUB (Home Unity Bible) groups meet weekly in local church families homes. This small group ministry is centered on fellowship and discussion of the pastor's sermon from Sunday.

As the use of coats of arms may be seen as a custom of royalty and nobility, it had been debated whether the use of arms is reconcilable with American republican traditions. Families from English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and other European nations with a heraldic tradition have retained their familial coat of arms in the United States. Several founding fathers also employed personal arms and a great number of Americans continue to do so. Usage of arms Most states do not employ coats of arms, but have chosen to use seals as their official emblems, but the United States has a coat of arms. The U.S. Constitution prohibits federal and state governments from conferring titles of nobility (see Title of Nobility Clause) and there are few noble coats of arms in the country. However private persons, including several past presidents, employ coats of arms either granted to them, or which they inherited. Since there is no official regulation on arms, except for the official seals, badges, insignia, decorations and medals of the country and the states, many private individuals have assumed arms, in addition to those who inherited them, or had them granted by or registered in another country. There is one anomalous exception to this lack of regulation: the coat of arms of the Swiss Confederation is specifically protected from unauthorized use within the U.S., under penalty of a fine and/or imprisonment for up to six months.US Code Title 18, Part I, Chapter 33, ¬ß 708. Retrieved on May 24, 2010. U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry Heraldic and other military symbols have been used by the military forces as well as other organizational elements of the government since the beginning of the Revolution. However, until 1919, there was no coordinated, overall military symbolism program. In that year, within the War Department General Staff, an office was delegated the responsibility for the coordination and approval of coats of arms and insignia of certain Army organizations. In 1924, formal staff responsibility for specific military designs was delegated to The Quartermaster General. As the needs for symbolism by the military services and the national government expanded, the scope of the services furnished by The Quartermaster General‚Äôs Office evolved into a sizable heraldic program. The acceleration of activities brought about by World War II, the expansion of the Army, and subsequent increase of interest in symbolism, contributed to the growth of the program. In 1949, the Munitions Board, acting for the Army, Navy and Air Force, directed the Army to provide heraldic services to all military departments. The program was expanded further as a result of the enactment of Public Law 85-263, approved September 1957, 71 Stat. 589, which delineates the authority of the Secretary of the Army to furnish heraldic services to the military departments and other branches of the federal government. The Institute of Heraldry was established in 1960 at Cameron Station in Alexandria, Virginia. Within the Institute, functions formerly performed within the Office of The Quartermaster General and several field activities were consolidated. Upon reorganization of the Army in 1962, responsibility for the Heraldic Program was assigned to The Adjutant General‚Äôs Office. In 1987, with the realignment of certain Army Staff agency functions, the Institute was transferred to the United States Army Human Resources Command. In April 1994, The Institute of Heraldry was relocated from Cameron Station to Fort Belvoir, Virginia. As a result of a realignment in October 2004, responsibility for the Heraldic Program was assigned to The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army, Resources and Programs Agency. Arms of George Washington The U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry consists of a staff of twenty civilians. The mission of the Institute is to furnish heraldic services to the Armed Forces and other United States government organizations, including the Executive Office of the President. The activities of the Institute encompass research, design, development, standardization, quality control, and other services relating to official symbolic items‚Äîseals, decorations, medals, insignia, badges, flags, and other items awarded to or authorized for official wear or display by government personnel and agencies. Limited research and information services concerning official symbolic items are also provided to the general public.The US Army Institute Of Heraldry Home Page . Retrieved on November 2, 2006. State heraldry Eighteen states have officially adopted a coat of arms. The former independent Republic of Texas and Kingdom of Hawaii each had a separate national coat of arms, which are no longer used. Puerto Rico has a coat of arms as well, originally granted by the Spanish Crown in 1512, which also influenced the design of that territory's seal. The flags of Maryland and the District of Columbia are heraldic banners of the historical coats of arms of specific individuals. Private heraldry There are several private organizations working to advance heraldic traditions in the United States such as The American College of Heraldry or Assume Arms . These organizations keep registers of arms and give advice on designing coats of arms. For a fee, the English College of Arms will devise arms for persons of English or Welsh descent, as the Scottish Court of the Lord Lyon will for persons of Scottish descent. The Chief Herald of Ireland has granted arms to Americans of Irish descent.

It is an alternate history where the Cuban Missile Crisis escalated to a full-scale war, the Soviet Union is devastated, and the United States has been reduced to a third-rate power, relying on the United Kingdom for aid. It won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History that year. Plot Set in the aftermath of a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States, the book chronicles the investigations of Carl Landry, a reporter for the Boston Globe. As the story unfolds, Carl attempts to uncover the events leading up to the war, while at the same time running from those who would have the truth buried. The story begins in 1972, ten years after a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviets, which was precipitated by the Cuban Missile Crisis. Washington, D.C., New York, Omaha, San Diego, Miami, and other U.S. cities, principally those surrounding military bases, have either been destroyed, damaged, or rendered uninhabitable by Soviet nuclear attacks. Philadelphia is now the capital of the United States, and although the Mexican-born President George W. Romney is nominally in office, the U.S. is effectively under martial law. The Soviets have been utterly devastated by U.S. nuclear strikes. Cuba is an atomic ruin, with Spain responsible for relief efforts aiding what is left of the island's population. One consequence of the war is that America's embroilment in Vietnam is abruptly curtailed. U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam (and indeed across the world) are withdrawn in order to stabilise the US in the aftermath of the Soviet missile and air strikes. The People's Republic of China has also collapsed, with numerous regional warlords waging a civil war against each other. U.S. nuclear strikes on the Soviets led to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, and also to the release of a massive fallout cloud over much of Asia, killing further millions after the destruction of the Soviets. As a consequence, the U.S. has become a pariah in the eyes of much of the world. Many governments regard members of the U.S. Air Force as war criminals, and its servicemen are advised not to travel abroad. After the 1962 war, nearly all the remaining countries of the globe have renounced possession of nuclear weapons. The United States alone retains an atomic arsenal. Western Europe survived the war largely unscathed. NATO collapsed almost as soon as hostilities commenced, and France and a reunited Germany now preside over the continent. The United Kingdom remains an ally of the U.S., and actually assists in post-war reconstruction efforts in U.S. states hit hardest by the war. The British, in the period after 1962, has managed to regain much of its pre-1939 colonial confidence in the vacuum left by the destruction of the Soviets and the emasculation of the U.S. in world affairs. The policy of decolonialisation has been halted and even reversed; some newly independent nations even return to the remaining British \\"Empire\\" in the new, uncertain world created after the \\"Cuban War\\". While British aid is welcome, there is also a sense of resentment in the U.S. over excessive dependence on the British. The presence of British and Canadian military personnel in the U.S. is also a source of contention, with some Americans wondering whether their allies possess ulterior motives. The story covers two parallel plotlines. The first involves Landry's attempts to discover what happened in Washington, D.C. in October 1962. U.S. military propaganda accounts maintain that the Cuban war broke out because of John F. Kennedy's recklessness and incompetence; these claims are generally believed. Kennedy and his officials are regarded as butchers and war criminals and the only senior surviving member of JFK's inner circle, McGeorge Bundy, is imprisoned in Fort Leavenworth. In contrast, U.S. military commanders (notably the Chief of the Air Force, General Curtis LeMay) are portrayed as the saviors of the nation. During the course of the novel Landry gradually discovers that it was Kennedy who sought to prevent the crisis over Cuba from escalating into war, and that last-minute attempts to achieve a deal with Nikita Khrushchev to end the crisis were deliberately sabotaged by LeMay and other generals. The second plotline concerns British-U.S. relations. Landry and a British journalist, Sandy Price, discover that elements within the British government and security services are plotting a military takeover (or anschluss) of the U.S. This plan is underway near the end of the novel, and is called off at the last minute.

It was initially located at Cornmarket, near Christ Church Cathedral, on the south side of the Liffey, and was originally one of the city gates. History From city gate to prison The exact date of construction of the New Gate is uncertain but it is recorded in 1188. From 1485 this city gate, which marked the western boundary, was used as Dublin's main prison. It was 180 feet (55 m) south of another gate, Brown's Castle, which would also become a place of detention known as the Black Dog. 18th century relocation Between 1773 and 1781, a new prison designed by Thomas Cooley was built to replace the earlier ruined prison. It was relocated to 'Little Green', present-day St. Michan's Park near Smithfield, and officially retained the old name. The new building was badly located and adequate sewerage could not be installed. There were also security concerns as the rear wall of the cells was also the site boundary wall. While there are no reports of successful escapes via this route, it was raised by Inspectors as an obvious design deficiency. All classes of prisoners were mingled together, up to 14 in a single cell. After inspections in the early 19th century some improvements were provided.Dalton: A New Picture of Dublin, Dublin, 1835. p. 169 19th century By the 1840s it was used solely for the holding of remand prisoners, both male and female, usually for a period between a few days and three weeks. On conviction and before sentencing the men were transferred to Richmond Bridewell and the women to Grangegorman-lane Prison. When visited by one of the Prison Inspectors in 1843 there were \\"30 Males, 9 Females and 11 Lunatics\\" confined there, but this was considerably less than the average of 100 usually kept there. They were accommodated in 62 cells, 4 dark 'solitary cells', 9 day-rooms, a chapel, 4 small rooms used as a hospital and a number of rooms previously used to hold debtors. There was no laundry or kitchen, the food consisting of bread and milk only. It was staffed by a governor, deputy governor, clerk, schoolmaster and ten 'turnkeys'. The prison finally closed in 1863, from which time until its demolition in 1893 it was used as a fruit and vegetable market. The outline of some of the Newgate Prison foundations are still visible at St. Michan's Park. References External links *DUBLIN HISTORICAL RECORD, VOL.

The Catholic Church The revenues of the Parish of Cambuslang (originally, Drumsagart) were obviously substantial enough for the priests to carry the title Rector. One - William Monypenny - had enough to endow a Chapel to Our Lady. These revenues also supported Vicars when the Rectors were made Prebendaries and were usually absent, attending to their official duties in Glasgow Cathedral. Cambuslang Parish was obviously a step on the career ladder of ambitious clerics who also had political ambitions. John Cameron (of the Lochiel Campbells) became Bishop of Glasgow - and made the Prebendaries of Cambuslang Chancellors of the Cathedral - and went on to hold all the Great Offices of State. David Beaton probably never even visited his Parish on his way up the ladder to become the Cardinal later murdered by soldiers supporting the Reformation in Scotland. Both Cameron and Beaton were members of the Scottish aristocracy, as were a number of other Rectors and Prebendaries - such as Lord Claud Hamilton - and the \\"English Cleric\\" mentioned below no doubt accompanied the many Anglo-Norman adventurers who came to Scotland at the time. The issues associated with the revenues of Cambuslang, and its entanglement with finding a living for young aristocrats, continued beyond the reformation. The revenues were in the hands of the landowners - the Heritors - who therefore nominated the Ministers, according to the Patronage Act, 1712. The established Protestant churches During the years of the Reformation, Cambuslang clergy were sometimes priests of the Episcopalian Church of Scotland and sometimes Ministers of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Several were doughty fighters for Presbyterianism, notably John Howison, while others, such as Patrick Hamilton gave much of their time to (sometimes provocative, not to say scurrilous) poetry. William M'Culloch organised great preaching festivals on the hillsides near his Kirk, inviting one of the founders of Methodism, George Whitefield to preach to upwards of 20,000 people. This \\"Cambuslang Wark\\" was part of an extraordinary series of revivalist movements which swept Scotland, England and New England in the 1740s. Subsequently, many of M‚ÄôCulloch's Elders opposed the Duke of Hamilton's nominee, James Meek as his successor, on the grounds that he was unsound in doctrine. Meek was a typical Moderate in the 18th Century Church of Scotland - well educated, ‚Äùenlightened‚Äù, well-connected - his friend and supporter was William Robertson, Principal of Edinburgh University - and more concerned with good Christian conduct, which often meant good order, than with what he thought of as the more contentious areas of scholastic Calvinist theology. He won the fight and became a much loved minister. He was followed in his place by Principal Robertson's nephew. This was John Robertson, who died the year before a great split in the Church of Scotland over the long-standing issues, familiar to his predecessor, of Patronage and doctrine. Later Ministers lived quieter lives. The Robert Blair not only helped translate the Bible into Gaelic, but also found time to translate Gaelic Poetry. Robert Sibbald Calderwood wrote \\"Bible Stories\\", but also proclaimed his patriotism on the coronation of George V. Other churches In 1799 some Christians who were not prepared to attend the Parish Kirk, perhaps including some remnants of M‚ÄôCulloch's Cambuslang Wark, rented a house to hold independent meetings. In 1801, they bought a building, which became known as the Tabernacle, in what is now Tabernacle Lane. David Dale, a Glasgow Merchant who lived nearby, contributed some money for this, and worshipped there himself. Thus began the Congregational Church in Cambuslang. After the Disruption of 1843, a Free Church of Scotland congregation was set up. The Duchess of Hamilton gave land for an Episcopalian Church to serve the needs of English immigrants who had come to work in the Cambuslang collieries and Hallside Steelworks (Newton). Later, Baptists and other Protestant denominations set up chapels, then more substantial churches. Similarly, Catholic immigrants from Ireland and the Highlands were served first by a chapel, then a more substantial church. Meanwhile, the growing population of Cambuslang meant that the Church of Scotland had to set up subsidiary churches - the mission church in Hallside, for example - to accommodate the growing population. These eventually became the separate Parishes of the Church of Scotland - Flemington Hallside Church, Trinity Parish Church and St Andrew's Church of Scotland, are remaining examples. Smaller Protestant Churches were also set up - Westcoats Evangelical Church for example, and the Gospel Hall.

It represents workers at a variety of workplaces in Winnipeg and elsewhere in Manitoba, Canada. It has a heavy representation in the service and retail sector, common for UFCW locals. Local 832 can be considered a 'mega-local', or a union local consisting of a large number of workers and workplaces. This is due to a long series of mergers between UFCW locals in Manitoba; much like with other mega-local mergers, there have been benefits and costs to the membership. Until the secession of the St. Boniface Hospital workers (into UFCW Local 1869), UFCW 832 contained nearly all UFCW-affiliated workplaces in Manitoba. As a result, it is the largest private-sector union in Manitoba.  Sectors represented in UFCW 832  This is a partial list of sectors represented by UFCW 832. * Grocery (Safeway, Westfair, Co-op, Sobeys) * Meatpacking (Maple Leaf Consumer Foods, Hylife Foods) * Poultry (Granny's Poultry Co-op Ltd., Dunn-Rite Foods) * Healthcare (Grace Hospital, BRHA (Burntwood Regional Health Authority) * Security (Garda, Securitas, Impact, G4S, Avion) * Light Industrial (Federated Co-op, Sysco, General Mills, Naleway, Old Dutch Foods, Lucerne)  History  Founded in 1938, Local 832 was approximately 700 members strong by 1964 when Bernard Christophe was elected president. Christophe held the presidency of Local 832 until ending his 38-year stretch as head of the local by stepping down in 2002 . He was replaced by Robert Ziegler in the fall of 2002, who held the office until he recently retired on December 1, 2011. On October the 24th, 2011, the local's executive board elected Jeff Traeger to be the local's third full-time president in its 73-year history. Jeff had been the treasurer since 2004, and Beatrice Bruske was also elected by the board to serve the remainder of Jeff's term as Secretary/Treasurer (the 1st female in an executive administrative role in the local's history). The local was recently successful in organizing a group of Mexican agricultural workers at Mayfair Foods. Although enough workers signed union cards to automatically certify in September 2006, a series of disputes before the Manitoba Labour Board pushed back their certification until June 26, 2007 CBC News, June 26th, 2007 (accessed July 17th, 2007). This certification has national importance, they became the first group of organized foreign farm workers in Canada.  Structure  The ultimate decision-making body for the UFCW Local 832 is the Executive Board, made up of the President, Secretary-Treasurer, Recorder, and 15 Vice- Presidents. All members of the Executive Board are elected by the general membership of the Local in an election held every four years. The President and Secretary-Treasurer are full-time, paid positions, while the Vice- Presidents are elected from different constituencies within the Local. These constituencies are made up of different employment sectors organized by the Local. Voting is not restricted by constituencies, and any member can vote for any or all of the positions open on the Board.

The battalion was in existence from 1881 until 1948, when it amalgamated with the 1st Battalion. History The 2nd Battalion's first action was in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, where it fought at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir under Lieutenant-General Sir Garnet Wolseley. The 1st Battalion fought in the Urabi Revolt of 1884. From Egypt it was sent to England before going to Bermuda in 1883, Nova Scotia, back to the West Indies and then on to South Africa (where they fought in the Second Matabele War) before going to India and finally Limerick in Ireland by 1912. Matabele War In March 1891 the 2nd Battalion left the West Indies bound for Cape Town, where detachments were sent on garrison duty all around South Africa. Some of the companies were trained as mounted infantry. In 1894 a large portion of the battalion was shipped to Mauritius just as rebellion was breaking out in Rhodesia where a large Matabele force entered the British colony of Mashonaland. A Matabele and Mashona revolt broke out, the beginning of the Second Matabele War. The future Field Marshal Herbert Plumer lead columns containing Yorks and Lancs as did Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Baden- Powell. Military operations in Rhodesia ended in October 1897. The British South Africa Company awarded medals to members of the regiment for their services. The Warren Hastings In January 1897 the 2nd Battalion, with members of the 60th Rifles was embarked on the ship Warren Hastings bound for India. On the way to Mauritius to pick up the detachment left there in 1894 the ship foundered off the island of R√©union. Although she did not sink she was a total loss. Not one single life was lost and this has been attributed to the complete lack of panic and the strong discipline exhibited by the soldiers on board. Two officers and two soldiers were awarded the Silver Medal of the Royal Humane Society, another received the Lloyd's Silver Medal whilst another received a Meritorious Service Medal for their actions in saving lives. Queen Victoria sent a letter to the regiment congratulating them on their discipline. First World War 1914 During the First World War the 2nd Battalion served in France and Flanders with the 16th Brigade, 6th Division. At the outbreak of war the battalion was based in Ireland from there they were hurried to the front in Belgium; they landed in France on 6 October 1914. The first action the 2nd Battalion was involved in was during the Race to the Sea when they fought at the Battle of Armenti√®res. They relieved greatly reduced battalions of Lincolnshire Regiment and the Royal Scots Fusiliers, which had just fought in the Battle of the Marne, and received their first casualties (three killed and eleven wounded) that night from German artillery. The 2nd Battalion along with the 1st Battalion, Buffs (East Kent Regiment) in a fast reconnaissance advanced and took the village of Radinghem on 18 October before coming under fierce machine gun fire.Marden (6th Division History) pp 16‚Äì17 The two battalions were forced back by a fierce German counterattack but according to Marden's History of the 6th Division; the situation was saved by Major Bayley's company from the Yorks and Lancs. Bayley's company worked its way around the left flank of the Germans, forcing them to halt their attack.Marden, p 17 The 6th Division fought a fierce battle for the high ground on a line from Preniesques to Radinghem. The fighting lasted from 20 to 31 October when the 6th Division was forced into low ground. After a brilliant defence by The Buffs and the 2nd Yorks and Lancs, Radinghem was lost and the 6th Division was forced into a line they would remain in for the next few months and the German offensive of 1918 would find the British still holding. The 6th Division suffered nearly 4,700 casualties in this battle. 1915 The 2nd Battalion spent most of the early part of 1915 holding a relatively quiet sector of the front. In July 1915 they were moved to the northwest of Ypres where they were involved in attempting to restore the line around Hooge which had been under heavy attacks after the Second Battle of Ypres ended. On 9 August 1915, at 3.15 am, the 6th Division launched an attack along a 1,000 yard front with the 2nd Yorks and Lancs on the left of the attack, supported by the 1st Buffs. The attack was completely successful with all objectives recaptured.Marden pp 23 The Yorks and Lancs were awarded the Battle Honour Hooge 1915 for their part in this battle. The battalion remained in this area for the rest of 1915. 1916 C-15, a British Mark I \\"male\\" tank, 25 September 1916. Photo by Ernest Brooks. The 2nd Battalion fought through the later battles of 1915 and was involved in the first battle that used tanks toward the end of the Somme campaign in 1916. At the Battle of Morval (25 to 27 September 1916) the 6th Division began their attacks on the morning of 25 September, which took all their objectives. The 2nd Yorks and Lancs, with the 1st King's Shropshire Light Infantry, captured the final objectives. With good weather and a well co-ordinated creeping artillery barrage the attack was one of the most successful of the Somme Campaign, with the 6th Division capturing 500 prisoners, six machine guns and four heavy trench mortars.Marden pp 33‚Äì34 During the Somme Campaign the 2nd Battalion was involved in three general attacks in September and October. The 6th Division suffered 6,917 casualties during the battle.Marden pp 35 1917 After the Somme Campaign the 6th Division was sent to the Loos Salient. Most of the early part of 1917 was relatively peaceful but after the Canadian success at the Battle of Vimy Ridge the Germans began withdrawing from various sectors in front of the British positions. On 13 April 1917, with forewarning that the Germans were going to be withdrawing from their positions in front of the 2nd Yorks and Lancs, the battalion was ordered to closely follow up as the Germans withdrew. The 2nd Battalion followed so closely that they completely occupied all the German positions by 6pm.Marden pp 37 During the next four days the division advanced so rapidly that they almost managed to capture Hill 70 (a strategically important German position) before the Germans strengthened their resistance.Marden pp 38 Other than this six-month period in the Loos salient the 2nd Battalion spent the rest of 1917 in various quiet sectors until the Battle of Cambrai began in November 1917. The British Offensive at Cambrai. The 6th Division were placed in the center of the attack on 20 November 1917, opposite Ribecourt. The 16th Brigade, including the 2nd Yorks and Lancs, were in the first wave of the attack which involved a 4,000 yard advance to take Ribecourt.Marden pp 45 The 6th Division captured Ribecourt and Marcoing when the cavalry took over the advance. By 7 December, the few positions the British had managed to hold onto, after the German counterattack and the battle had ended, were those gained by the 6th Division at Ribecourt. 1918 In March 1918 the 6th Division was based around Lagnicourt when the German Spring Offensive was launched. The 6th Division lost over 5,000 men in the first two days of the retreat. During the Battle of the Lys in April 1918 the division suffered further heavy casualties forcing the division out of action until September 1918. In September 1918 the 6th Division went into action for the last time during The Great War when they took part in the Hundred Days Offensive. By 31 October the 2nd Yorks and Lancs were on the banks of the Sambre-Oise Canal when they were withdrawn from the front line. In six weeks of fighting the 6th Division had suffered over 6,200 more casualties. The end of the war found the 6th Division resting in billets near Bohain. The division had suffered over 53,000 casualties during the First World War. Private John Caffrey was awarded the only Victoria Cross won by the battalion during the First World War in November 1915. In 1919 the battalion was sent to Iraq with the 17th Division's 51st Brigade. Inter-War Years After the Great War the 2nd Battalion were sent to Mesopotamia as part of an occupation force for the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. From 1921 to 1939 they were on garrison duty in India and then Sudan. During their time in India the 2nd Battalion won the Durand Football Cup three times; in 1927, 1929 and 1930. Second World War At the out break of the Second World War the 2nd Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment was based in Khartoum in the Sudan on garrison duties. In July 1940 they were moved to Egypt and then to Palestine where they became part of the 14th Infantry Brigade. The battalion was again part of the 6th Infantry Division. In May 1940 the Brigade moved to Cairo and was then broken up. The 2nd Battalion went to Alexandria. On 28 October Lieutenant-Colonel Sim, C.O. of the battalion, was told by Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, commanding the British Eastern Mediterranean Fleet, that the battalion was now on loan to the Royal Navy and would be moving to Crete as soon as possible in the cruiser HMS Ajax. On 1 November 1940, the battalion sailed for Crete, arriving at Suda Bay on the 2 November. Their arrival was met by an attack from the Italian Air Force, Lance-Corporal Loosemore and Private Lister were both wounded. They were the battalions first casualties of the Second World War. On 31 December 1940 Lieut.Col.Sim went to Egypt and Maj.A.Gilroy (Black Watch), who would later command the 14th Infantry Brigade, took command of the battalion. The 14th Brigade was reformed around the 2nd Yorks and Lancs and 2nd Black Watch and under the command of Brig.B.H.Chappel DSO. The brigade spent its time building defenses on the island, but these were limited. Little happened on Crete until April 1941 when the Allied forces in Greece were evacuated. Battle of Crete German paratroopers landing on Crete With the surrender of Greece in 1941 Crete was thrust into the war. The 2nd Battalion, Yorks and Lancs along with the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch and 2nd Bn, The Leicestershire Regiment were tasked with the defence of Heraklion airfield. From the middle of May 1941 air attacks against Heraklion increased to four or five a day until 20 May when troop carriers dropped paratroopers at Maleme airfield on the west of the island. Warning reached Heraklion as their own share of German troop transports were spotted arriving at about 400 feet four abreast in long columns that stretched out of sight. This was the largest of the German parachute formations made up of the 1st Fallschirmjager Regiment, 2nd Battalion from the 2nd Fallschirmjager Regiment and an AA Machine Gun Battalion under the command of Col.Bruno Brauer. The three battalions of the 14th Brigade managed to kill or wound nearly all the German parachute troops that were landed at Heraklion on in this first wave, apart from a small pocket, the brigade had inflicted massive casualties on the enemy paratroopers. The three battalions of the 14th Brigade managed to destroy nearly all the German parachute troops that were landed at Heraklion on 20 May apart from a small pocket: the brigade inflicted massive casualties on the enemy paratroopers. After this attempt the Germans did not try to land any more paratroopers at Heraklion instead they built up their forces outside the perimeter. Before the Germans were able to complete the encirclement of Heraklion a company from the 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders joined the defence from Tymbaki on the south coast. The German forces from Maleme landed four more companies of troops in the vicinity of Heraklion which successfully linked up with the survivors of the first landings and launched counterattacks on the British positions. The fighting at this time was extremely fierce but the Yorks and Lancs held their positions. By 28 May the position on the island as a whole had been lost and General Freyberg ordered the evacuation. When the men of the 14th Brigade heard of the evacuation they were astonished; The Evacuation Alexandria The evacuation was badly attacked during the withdrawal to Alexandria with over one-fifth of the 4,000 troops evacuated being killed, wounded or captured on the voyage out. The destroyer HMS Imperial suffered mechanical failure and had to be sunk by the Hotspur and due to the delay, caused by transferring men over to the other ships, the convoy was still well within reach of the Luftwaffe and Italian Air Force. The Hereward was sunk (her survivors were rescued by the Italians). Both the Dido and the Orion suffered massive bomb damage with heavy casualties amongst the crew and troops packed onboard both ships. Some 600 troops were killed or captured before the convoy could reach safety. After a brief period of recovery in Egypt the 2nd Battalion was sent with the 14th Brigade to fight the Vichy French forces in Syria. As they arrived at Damascus the French had surrendered. The battalion remained in Syria on occupational duty until mid- October 1941 when they moved to Alexandria to a staging camp from where they would be sent to Tobruk to relieve the besieged Australian 9th Division. Battle of Tobruk The 6th Infantry Division was renumbered as the 70th Infantry Division, for deception purposes, and given a new commander (Maj.Gen. Ronald Scobie) and then were sailed into Tobruk by the Royal Navy from 19 August to 25 October 1941. The 70th Division along with the Polish Carpathian Brigade, a Czech brigade and the 2/13th Australian Infantry Battalion, which missed the boat out, settled into the considerable defences. The 2nd Battalion was placed in the 2nd line (Blue Line) of defences. In November the garrison was informed of its role in the upcoming Operation Crusader in which the 70th Division would have to break out through the besieging German and Italian force and link up with British Eighth Army. The 2nd Battalion were one of the reserve battalions in the break out. They suffered massive casualties assaulting the enemy positions after the first assaults. While the relief force got held up fighting toward Tobruk, the battalions of the 70th Division had to hold the positions they had gained and wait. The battle ended up resembling trench warfare from the First World War. Operation Crusader turned into weeks of attrition the cost of which finally pushed Rommel away from the perimeter of Tobruk allowing Eighth Army to lift the siege. Tobruk would not stay liberated long; during the Battle of Gazala in 1942 the fortress fell with the Axis forces taking thousands of prisoners of war. Chindits A Chindit column crossing a river in Burma The 2nd Battalion, however, did not remain in North Africa to see the fall of Tobruk instead they were to head to one of the most difficult fighting terrains in the Second World War, on 28 February 1942 the 70th Division was put aboard ships headed for India to help stop the rapid advance of the Japanese Army in Burma. The 70th Infantry Division, consisting of regular army troops, was considered one of the better and more experienced of the British divisions operating at this stage of the war. The Far East Command fully appreciated the arrival of this formation but instead of using the division as a complete formation it was decided to break it up for long range infiltration operations behind Japanese lines much against the wishes of General Slim, commander of the Fourteenth Army. The units of the division were converted into Chindit brigades and the battalions were organized into columns. The 2nd Battalion became the 65th and 84th columns in the 14th Chindit Brigade. After months of training and waiting for the right opportunity Operation Thursday began on 5 February 1944: this was the second large scale Chindit operation (Operation Longcloth happened in 1943). The 14th Brigade was flown into a landing strip (called Aberdeen) cut out of the jungle by the 16th Brigade. From Aberdeen the battalion sent out missions to attack Japanese supply lines and communications. After the death in a plane crash of the commander and creator of the Chindits Maj.Gen. Orde Wingate on 24 March, decisions were made and the plans were changed. Without the force of Wingate driving the operation forward focus for the Chindit forces was switched to battles on the Indian border at Kohima. The 14th Brigade with the 2nd Yorks and Lancs made an incredible and exhausting march through the heavy jungle, heading north to operate with US Gen. Joe Stillwell. The brigade lost many men on the march and when they arrived were not in any condition to fight immediately. The 14th Brigade remained in action supporting the newly formed 36th Infantry Division until August 1944. Most of the casualties suffered during this campaign were from malaria, dysentery and malnutrition. The battalion was then moved to India and did not take part in any further operations during the Second World War. Throughout the Second World War the 2nd Battalion had fought against the Germans, Italians, Japanese and the Vichy French in four different campaigns and in extremely different environments. Post 1945 In 1947 the 2nd Battalion was given orders for disbanding and amalgamation with the 1st Battalion. It was reformed in 1952 but disbanded again in 1955. In 1968 the York and Lancaster Regiment chose to disband rather than amalgamate further. The colours were laid up in Sheffield Cathedral ending 210 years of the regiment's history. The name would be carried on by The Hallamshire Battalion in various forms.

Turkel (pronounced like 'Tur-KEL'; born in 1970) is an Uyghur American attorney, public official and human rights advocate based in Washington, D.C.. Turkel was born in Kashgar, Xinjiang. After his undergraduate graduation in 1995, he moved to the United States. He was president of the Uyghur American Association and is currently serving as the Chairman of the Board for the Uyghur Human Rights Project, a Washington, D.C.-based project for Uyghur human rights research and documentation. In 2020, Turkel was appointed a commissioner on the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Turkel is the first U.S.-educated Uyghur lawyer and the first Uyghur American to be appointed to a political position in the United States. In September 2020, Turkel was named one of the Time 100 Most Influential People in the World. Early life Nury Turkel was born in a detention center in Kashgar (Kashi) during the Cultural Revolution. Turkel's grandfather had been associated with Uyghur nationalists and his mother was interned when she was six months pregnant. Turkel and his mother lived in the detention center for the first four months of his life. Turkel's father was a professor and his mother was a businesswoman. He completed his primary and middle school in his homeland. In 1991, he was admitted by Northwest A&F; University in Shaanxi Province, China. In 1995, Turkel received his Bachelor's degree and went to the United States for his higher education and never returned to China. He has a Master of Arts in International Relations and a Juris Doctorate degree from American University. Career US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo meets with Commissioner Turkel and Chinese dissidents (July 2020) On March 10, 2003, Turkel made a statement to the Congressional-Executive Commission on China on the worsening human rights situation in East Turkestan (Xinjiang) in the wake of the September 11 attacks. In 2003, Turkel co-founded the Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP) and has served as Chairman of the Board for the organization. Between 2004 and 2006, Turkel served as President of the Uyghur American Association. He organised and lead the campaign to obtain the release of Rebiya Kadeer, in March 2005. In May 2009, he defended a group of seventeen Uyghurs who were held in Guant√°namo Bay since 2002. He wrote that Uyghurs have faced discrimination and are not a threat to U.S. communities. In July 2009, after July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots, he condemned alleged Chinese oppression of Uyghurs in Urumqi, he said that, \\"the Uyghurs literally lost anything that they had, even their native language and their own cultural heritage that they had been proudly adhering to. The economic pressure, social pressure, political pressure made the Uyghurs feel they had been suffocated by the communist regime.‚Äô‚Äô In April 2012, Turkel praised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan for showing support and sympathy for the Uighur people surrounding his trip to China in a way that was seen as rare among foreign leaders. However, in July 2020, Turkel criticized Turkey for deportation of Uyghur refugees to countries that then deport them to China. In early 2017, Turkel had considered visiting his hometown of Kashgar, but was advised by the US government not to travel. On August 10, 2018, the United Nations said that it has credible reports that China is holding a million Uighurs in secret camps. After that, on August 22, 2018, the BBC interviewed Turkel regarding the reeducation camps issue in Xinjiang. He told BBC it was true that one million or more Uighurs are being held in so called internment camps in his homeland and said that internees do not have access to legal rights or access to medical care.}}In September 2018, Turkel testified about the Xinjiang re-education camps before the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation. Turkel successfully represented and provided legal assistance for Dolkun Isa, president of the World Uyghur Congress, restoring Isa's travel privileges to the United States and removing Isa's name from Interpol‚Äôs Red Notice list. In September 2019, Turkel testified to Congress that Uyghurs were being swept into a vast system of forced labor. Turkel said persons in the Xinjiang re-education camps are often moved to factories. Turkel wrote that Congress should ban the importation of cotton and textile products from Xinjiang until the end of internment and forced labor policies and the establishment of conditions for due diligence. In May 2020, Nury Turkel was appointed a commissioner on the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi who said of Turkel, \\"I am confident that he will continue to be a powerful voice for the Uyghur people and for the cause of justice around the world.\\" Later that summer, Turkel thanked President Trump for signing the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act and further wrote that, \\"It's a great day for America and the Uighur people\\". Commissioner Turkel supported a July 2020 Commerce Department announcement sanctioning eleven Chinese companies involved in alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang commenting that the decision, \\"will help ensure that the fruits of American innovation and industry are not inadvertently fueling outrageous religious freedom and labor violations.\\" Turkel commented on July 2020 sanctions of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) saying that they were a significant step and that for years Uyghur human rights advocates had been calling for sanctioning the organization. Regarding sanctions of the XPCC, Commissioner Turkel commented that, ‚ÄúNow, no business can claim ignorance of China's oppression of the Uyghur people. We hope the sanctions signal to other Chinese officials that there are costs associated with taking part in the Communist Party‚Äôs repression of religion. The world is watching and we know which officials and entities are responsible for the abuses against the Uyghur people.‚Äù In an August 2020 interview, Turkel described the camps as one of the worst global humanitarian crises and the largest incarceration of an ethnic minority since the Holocaust. In mid 2020, Turkel urged Congress to pass the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would direct the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to presume that any goods produced in the Uyghur region are the product of forced labor. In September 2020, Turkel was named one of the Time 100 Most Influential People in the World. Personal life Nury Turkel is a Muslim, is married to a Turkish American interior designer and has a son. Turkel is proficient in several languages, including Uyghur (mother tongue), English, Turkish and Mandarin Chinese.

In the , Beerburrum had a population of 763 people. Geography Beerburrum is north of the state capital, Brisbane. The Bruce Highway passes from south to north through the locality approximately east of the town. The North Coast railway line also passes from south to north through the locality which is served by Beerburrum railway station on the eastern edge of the town. The locality is predominantly on the mainland but includes a number of undeveloped islands in the Pumicestone Passage between the mainland and Bribie Island. The named islands are Long Island () and Thooroola Island (known as Goat Island until 1981, ). The eastern part of the locality is low- lying land with many creeks which drain into the Pumicestone Passage. The western party of the locality is higher hillier land and includes two of the Glass House Mountains: Mount Beerburrum and Mount Tibberoowuccum, both of which are protected within the Glass House Mountains National Park. Mount Beerburrum () is composed of porphyritic trachyte. It is high. The mountain has complex rainforest, with some endangered plant species such as Tindal's stringybark (Eucalyptus tindaliae), Pink bloodwood (Corymbia intermedia) and Smooth-barked apple (Angophora leiocarpa). Scribbly gum (Eucalyptus racemosa) is locally predominant in places, with the largest tract retained on Mount Beerburrum. The mountain has a forestry fire tower with a viewing platform at the summit. Mount Tibberoowuccum () is composed of alkali rhyolite. It is high. The mountain is a dome-shaped rock surrounded by eucalypt open forest, as well as complex rainforest, although the area is not extensive. There is a small population of Narrow-leaf bitter-pea (Daviesia Mimosoides) present on the southern slope of the mountain. This shrub is widespread in Victoria and New South Wales, but rare in Queensland, and the Mount Tiberoocwuccum population is the most northerly known. History left Soldiers farm, Beerburrum, 1918 The name is derived from that of the mountain, Mount Beerburrum. In the language of the Indigenous Kabi nation, bir means green parrot and burru mountain. On 26 July 1799, Matthew Flinders and two sailors from the ship Norfolk climbed Mount Beerburrum accompanied by Aboriginal man Bongaree from Sydney. They were the first Europeans to climb one of the Glass House Mountains. Thomas Martin Tripcony was one of the first European settlers to settle along the Pumicestone Passage (which separates the mainland from Bribie Island). In 1861 he selected coastal land on the mainland side of the passage between Hussey Creek () and Glass Mountain Creek () which he called Cowrie Bank. He made his living by lime burning and oystering there and at a number of locations in the passage, but in 1876 settled permanently at Cowrie Bank, building a family home (also called Cowrie Bank) in 1877. The North Coast line from Caboolture to Landsborough (which included a siding at Beerburrum) was completed on 1 February 1890. This opened up access to the district for settlement. A cemetery was established at Beerburrum circa 1908. It was officially closed in 1970 with about 12 graves still visible. In 1916, Beerburrum was chosen to be a soldier settlement with over 550 farms allocated. Beerburrum Soldier Settlement was the largest soldier settlement in Queensland. The expectation was that hilly land would be suitable for growing pineapples and other fruits. However, by 1929, it was generally acknowledged that the scheme had failed (like many others), due to the farms being too small to be economically viable. This was compounded by shortages of skills, capital, and markets. Beerburrum Post Office opened by 1917 (a receiving office had been open from 1893). Beerburrum State School opened on 22 April 1918. In 1920, a memorial avenue of trees (camphor laurels and weeping figs) was planted in the town's main street to commemorate those who had served in World War I. The street was renamed Anzac Avenue. Circa 1920, the Beerburrum Bakery opened as part of a group of shops in Anzac Avenue. With the failure of the soldier settlement, most of the shops closed and the buildings relocated elsewhere. The bakery is the only surviving shop building from the settlement. A School of Arts hall was established circa 1920 in Anzac Avenue and remains one of the few buildings that survive from the settlement. On 4 February 1922, the Queensland Treasurer John Fihelly officiated at the opening of the cottage hospital at Beerburrum. It closed in 1931 following the failure of the settlement. St George's Anglican Church was dedicated on 20 August 1922 by Canon D.J. Garland. The building was originally built as a chapel at the Enoggera army barracks during World War I by the Soldiers' Church of England Help Society.Download Many of the furnishings and ornaments in the Enoggera barracks church were donated in memory of soldiers who had died, including the altar and its furnishings which were donated in the member of Earl Kitchener. Due to the failure of the soldier settlement, the church fell into disuse. It was officially closed in August 1931, after which the church was moved to Maleny, where it was dedicated to St George on 6 September 1931 by Archbishop Sharp. After World War II, pine plantations were developed in the area as state forests creating a local forestry industry. Circa 1947 a Forestry Station Barracks was built to accommodate forestry workers. The Bruce Highway originally passed along the western boundary of the town (later known as Old Bruce Highway and now as Beerburrum Road). In the early 1970s, the town was bypassed to its immediate east in the early 1970s, and that road (called Glasshouse Mountains Road and now Steve Irwin Way) was itself superseded by the current alignment of the highway further to the east in 1985. At the 2006 census, Beerburrum had a population of 287. At the 2011 census, Beerburrum had a population of 600.

Industrial goods are those an industry of uses to produce an end product from one or more raw materials. The term, industrial marketing has largely been replaced by the term B2B marketing (i.e. business to business marketing). Origins and usage Historically, the marketing discipline made a distinction between industrial marketing and consumer goods marketing. During the 1980s, businesses shifted from industrial marketing to business marketing. Within a decade, the term business marketing had largely displaced industrial marketing. By the late 1990s, the term, B2B marketing, came into widespread use.Hunt, S.D., \\"A General Theory of Business Marketing: R-A theory, Alderson, the ISBM framework, and the IMP Theoretical Structure,\\" Industrial Marketing Management, Vol. 42, 2013, pp 283-293  Industrial, or business-to-business (B2B) marketing  Main features of the B2B selling process are: * Marketing is one-to-one in nature. It is relatively easy for the seller to identify a prospective customer and build a face-to- face relationship. * Highly professional and trained people in buying processes are involved. In many cases, two or three decision makers must approve a purchase plan. * Often the buying or selling process is complex, and includes many stages (for example, request for proposal, request for tender, selection process, awarding of tender, contract negotiations, and signing of final contract). * Selling activities involve long processes of prospecting, qualifying, wooing, making representations, preparing tenders, developing strategies, and contract negotiations.  Blurring between B2B and B2C  Industrial marketing can cross the border into consumer marketing. For example, an electronic component seller may distribute its products through industrial marketing channels (see Channel (marketing)), but also support consumer sales. Many products are equally desired by business and consumers-- such as audio products, furniture, paint, hardware, etc. Nonetheless, manufactures and service providers frequently maintain separate industrial and consumer marketing operations to reflect the different needs of the two channels.  Competitive tendering  Industrial marketing often involves competitive tendering. This is a process where a purchasing organization undertakes to procure goods and services from suitable suppliers. Due to the high value of some purchases (for example buying a new computer system, manufacturing machinery, or outsourcing a maintenance contract) and the complexity of such purchases, the purchasing organization will seek to obtain a number of bids from competing suppliers and choose the best offering. An entire profession (strategic procurement) that includes tertiary training and qualifications has been built around the process of making important purchases. The key requirement in any competitive tender is to ensure that: * The business case for the purchase has been completed and approved. * The purchasing organization's objectives for the purchase are clearly defined. * The procurement process is agreed upon and it conforms with fiscal guidelines and organizational policies. * The selection criteria have been established. * A budget has been estimated and the financial resources are available. * A buying team (or committee) has been assembled. * A specification has been written. * A preliminary scan of the market place has determined that enough potential suppliers are available to make the process viable (this can sometimes be achieved using an expression of interest process). * It has been clearly established that a competitive tendering process is the best method for meeting the objectives of this purchasing project. If (for example) it was known that there was only one organisation capable of supplying; best to get on with talking to them and negotiating a contract. Because of the significant value of many purchases, issues of probity arise. Organisations seek to ensure that awarding a contract is based on \\"best fit\\" to the agreed criteria, and not bribery, corruption, or incompetence.  Bidding process  Suppliers who are seeking to win a competitive tender go through a bidding process. At its most primitive, this would consist of evaluating the specification (issued by the purchasing organization), designing a suitable proposal, and working out a price. This is a \\"primitive\\" approach because... * There is an old saying in industrial marketing; \\"if the first time you have heard about a tender is when you are invited to submit, then you have already lost it.\\" * While flippant, the previous point illustrates a basic requirement for being successful in competitive tendering; it is important to develop a strong relationship with a prospective customer organization well before they have started the formal part of their procurement process.  Industrial buying journey  Before industrial buyers engage in the bidding process, they go through a long and distinct buying journey. A 2018 study conducted by Thomasnet.com and the research firm Strategyn revealed that the industrial buying process involves 15 distinct steps: # Establish the business need for acquiring a specific product or service. # Define the requirements the product or service must meet. # Determine what products or services to consider. # Determine if a new product or service is necessary to address the business need. # Determine if buying a new product or service is financially justifiable and affordable. # Define the criteria to use to evaluate the products or services under consideration. # Prioritize the criteria to use to evaluate the products or services under consideration. # Evaluate alternative products or services against the prioritized criteria. # Select the product or service to acquire. # Define the criteria to use to evaluate the suppliers that offer the needed product or service. # Prioritize the criteria used to evaluate suppliers offering the needed product or service. # Determine what suppliers to consider. # Evaluate alternative suppliers against the prioritized criteria. # Select the supplier from which to acquire the product or service. # Initiate the product or service purchase. By aligning their marketing activities to the buying cycle, industrial manufacturers and suppliers can be more successful. This is very similar to the inbound process of inbound marketing.  Non- tender purchasing  Not all industrial sales involve competitive tendering. Tender processes are time consuming and expensive, particularly when executed with the aim of ensuring probity. Government agencies are particularly likely to utilise elaborate competitive tendering processes due to the expectation that they should be seen at all times to be responsibly and accountably spending public money. Private companies are able to avoid the complexity of a fully transparent tender process but are still able to run the procurement process with some rigour.  Solution selling  B2B firms make extensive use of solution selling where sales force identify the client's problem or needs and sell goods or services that specifically address those needs. In solution selling, it is essential that sales staff explore the client's requirements in depth before presenting a solution. Marketing supports solution selling through methods like account-based marketing--understanding a specific target organization's requirements as the foundation of a marketing program. As research shows, sales success is heavily weighted towards suppliers who understand the customer. In UK research, 77 per cent of senior decision-makers believe new suppliers' marketing approaches are poorly targeted and make it easy to justify staying with current suppliers).Malaval: \\"Strategy and Management of Industrial Brands: Business to Business Products and Services\\", page 16. 2001 Sales force management has a critical function in industrial selling, where it assumes a greater role than other parts of the marketing mix. Typical industrial organisations depend on the ability of their sales people to build relationships with customers. During periods of high demand (economic boom), sales forces often become mere order takers and struggle to respond to customer requests for quotations and information. However, when economic downturn hits it becomes critical to direct the sales force outward to sell.  From cannon fodder to preferred tenderer  The term \\"cannon fodder\\" derives from the World Wars and refers to the massing of undertrained and recently recruited troops sent to the fronts to face the enemy. Such troops invariably had a poor survival rate but provided the tactical advantage of distracting the enemy while professional soldiers mounted more effective operations. In adopting the term to Industrial Marketing it means those bids being submitted that have no chance of winning but are involved to make up the numbers (you can't have only one bid in a \\"competitive\\" tender process; that wouldn't satisfy the requirements of probity) (for example in government tenders, or for private enterprise the requirement to \\"truly test the market\\" and to \\"keep them honest\\"). The reader might be wondering why anybody would go to all of the work of submitting a tender when they had no chance of winning; for the same reason that troops were sent into battle to die; they thought they had a real chance.  Indicators  In industrial marketing personal selling is still very effective because many products must be customized to suit the requirements of the individual customer. Indicators such as the sales tunnel give information on the expected sales in the near future, the hit rate indicates whether the sales organization is busy with promising sales leads or it is spending too much effort on projects that are eventually lost to the competition or that are abandoned by the prospect.  The Internet and B2B marketing  The dot-com boom and bust of the late 1990s saw significant attempts to develop online shopping. Many entrepreneurs (and their investors) discovered that merely having a website (no matter how innovative) was insufficient to generate sales. The amount of conventional media advertising required to promote the sites burnt cash at a faster rate than on-line sales generated. They also presumed that consumers would eschew the conventional shopping experience (driving, parking, poor service etc.) for the convenience of shopping on-line. Some did, but for many companies, not in sufficient numbers. There were many unforeseen problems, and apart from some notable exceptions (Amazon.com and others) the business to consumer online failed for many companies. B2B selling, however, more frequently achieved impressive results.

In humans CD20 is encoded by the MS4A1 gene. This gene encodes a member of the membrane-spanning 4A gene family. Members of this nascent protein family are characterized by common structural features and similar intron/exon splice boundaries and display unique expression patterns among hematopoietic cells and nonlymphoid tissues. This gene encodes a B-lymphocyte surface molecule that plays a role in the development and differentiation of B-cells into plasma cells. This family member is localized to 11q12, among a cluster of family members. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants that encode the same protein.  Function  The protein has no known natural ligand and its function is to enable optimal B-cell immune response, specifically against T-independent antigens. It is suspected that it acts as a calcium channel in the cell membrane. CD20 is induced in the context of microenvironmental interactions by CXCR4/SDF1 (CXCL12) chemokine signaling and the molecular function of CD20 has been linked to the signaling propensity of B-cell receptor (BCR) in this context.  Expression  CD20 is expressed on all stages of B cell development except the first and last; it is present from late pro-B cells through memory cells, but not on either early pro-B cells or plasma blasts and plasma cells. It is found on B-cell lymphomas, hairy cell leukemia, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and melanoma cancer stem cells. Immunohistochemistry can be used to determine the presence of CD20 on cells in histological tissue sections. Because CD20 remains present on the cells of most B-cell neoplasms, and is absent on otherwise similar appearing T-cell neoplasms, it can be very useful in diagnosing conditions such as B-cell lymphomas and leukaemias. However, the presence or absence of CD20 in such tumours is not relevant to prognosis, with the progression of the disease being much the same in either case. CD20 positive cells are also sometimes found in cases of Hodgkins disease, myeloma, and thymoma. Antibody FMC7 (Flinders Medical Centre) appears to recognise a conformational variant of CD20 also known as the FMC7 antigen.  Clinical significance  CD20 is the target of the monoclonal antibodies rituximab, ocrelizumab, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, ibritumomab tiuxetan, tositumomab, and ublituximab, which are all active agents in the treatment of all B cell lymphomas, leukemias, and B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. The anti-CD20 mAB ofatumumab (Genmab) was approved by FDA in October 2009 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The anti-CD20 mAB obinutuzumab (Gazyva) was approved by FDA in November 2013 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Additional anti-CD20 antibody therapeutics under development (phase II or III clinical trials in 2008) include : *Obinutuzumab for systemic lupus erythematosus, *Rituximab for myalgic encephalomyelitis *Ocaratuzumab for follicular lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis, *Ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis (rheumatoid arthritis discontinued in 2010), *TRU-015 (by Trubion), (discontinued in 2010) *IMMU-106 (veltuzumab).Note: information included in this article only found in table present in print version of article. for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or (2015) immune thrombocytopenia. B cells, CD20, and diabetes mellitus A link between the immune system's B cells and diabetes mellitus has been determined. In cases of obesity, the presence of fatty tissues surrounding the body's major organ systems results in cell necrosis and insulin desensitivity along the boundary between them. Eventually, the contents of fat cells that would otherwise have been digested by insulin are shed into the bloodstream. An inflammation response that mobilizes both T and B cells results in the creation of antibodies against these cells, causing them to become less responsive to insulin by an as-yet unknown mechanism and promoting hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and arteriosclerosis, hallmarks of the metabolic syndrome. Obese mice administered anti-B cell CD-20 antibodies, however, did not become less responsive to insulin and as a result did not develop diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome, the posited mechanism being that anti-CD20 antibodies rendered the T cell antibodies dysfunctional and therefore powerless to cause insulin desensitivity by a B cell antibody- modulated autoimmune response. The protection afforded by anti-CD-20 lasted approximately forty days‚Äîthe time it takes the body to replenish its supply of B cells‚Äîafter which repetition was necessary to restore it. Hence, it has been argued that diabetes mellitus be reclassified as an autoimmune disease rather than a purely metabolic one and focus treatment for it on immune system modulation.

It dates back to the 16th century. Background The Swiss Federal Diets of 1480 and 1483 talked about national days of fasting as penitence and thanksgiving, but in the end, left these decisions to the cantons. With no federal law, fast days became pilgrimages, processions, litanies and fasts.Catherine Santschi, La m√©moire des Suisses, Association de l'Encyclop√©die de Gen√®ve, 1991 In 1522 Huldrych Zwingli, who helped stir Protestant Reformation in Switzerland, said fasting laws were only human notions which had nothing to do with the Holy Writ. Nonetheless, the plagues of Basle (1541) and Berne (1565 and 1577) were followed by days of penitence and fasting, asking God for clemency and mercy.Olivier Fatio, Le Je√ªne genevois, r√©alit√© et mythe (BSHAG14), 1971. Began before St. Bartholomew's Day massacre Geneva was a cradle of Protestantism and the Reformation. There was a Geneva-wide fast in the beginning of October 1567 as a sign of friendship with Protestants undergoing persecution in Lyon, France and this was most likely the first Je√ªne genevois (Genevan fast). Five years later, news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and the slaughter of several thousand Huguenots beginning on 24 August 1572 triggered a fast throughout Geneva on the following 3 September, which could be why the date of later yearly fasts was shifted forward by almost a month. By 1640, through sway of the reformed cantons, the fast had become yearly and was carried on even after the Genevan revolution of 1792. Je√ªne genevois later became a patriotic holiday, symbolizing both Geneva's proud identity and its Protestantism. By the beginning of the Helvetic Republic folklore had thoroughly linked Je√ªne genevois with the widely remembered St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and fasting in Geneva as the slaughter of whole Protestant families carried on throughout France.FAO de Gen√®ve 250th Year, # 102 In Geneva In 1831 the Federal Diet decreed a Je√ªne F√©d√©ral (federal fast) for all cantons, fixing the date at 8 September. This was later made the third Sunday in September but for Geneva, which fixed the day of its own Je√ªne genevois. In 1869 Geneva decreed that the holiday was no longer official, but Je√ªne genevois was celebrated unofficially until 1965, slowly losing its religious significance. On 1 August 1966 it was again declared a public holiday and the date fixed as the Thursday following the first Sunday of September. The religious fasting of Je√ªne genevois is not widely followed. Banks and post offices along with many shops, restaurants and bars close for the day. However, unlike Thanksgiving in the U.S., which also falls on a Thursday, a four-day weekend is not usually taken and most businesses are open on Friday.

History Preserved Grey-Green Alexander bodied Volvo Citybus as used on route 24 from 1988 London General Alexander Dennis Enviro400 at Trafalgar Square in June 2011 Route 24 dates back to 1910, when it ran between Hampstead Heath and Victoria station. In August 1912 it was extended to Pimlico and has continued in that form until the present day, making this the oldest unchanged bus route in London.London's oldest bus routes The London Magazine Thirty-three Daimler double-decker buses with 34 seats were allocated to route 24, now running between Pimlico and Hampstead, with the fleet name \\"British\\" painted in green livery. These buses were running from Camden Town (AQ) garage until they were replaced by AEC NS-Type buses in 1927. Thirty-three NS-type buses were used on route 24 until 1934. Originally, the route was operated by the London General Omnibus Company, and later the British Automobile Traction Co until September 1933, when the London Passenger Transport Board, later London Transport Executive, was formed and ran under the name \\"London Transport\\". During its life with London Transport, route 24 was operated mainly from Chalk Farm (CF) garage in Harmood Street. It was also run at times from Victoria (Gillingham Street; GM) garage. On 7 November 1965, the first 30 Leyland Atlantean buses entered service on route 24. It was the first route to use front-entrance double-decker buses in London. Routes 67 and 271 also trialled front-entrance buses. On 12 June 1966, the Atlanteans moved to Tottenham garage and were replaced by AEC Routemasters. The route was crew operated until 25 October 1986, apart from two short periods in 1965/1966 and 1975. The route was the first central London route to be awarded under the tendering process to a private company, Grey-Green, on 5 November 1988, using Alexander bodied Volvo Citybuses painted in its own grey, green and orange livery from its Stamford Hill garage. Grey- Green were owned by Cowie Group, and became part of Arriva London following the company's acquisition of two other London operators. Upon being re- tendered, in November 2002 the route passed to Metroline's Holloway garage, and in 2006 was the first London bus route to be operated by Alexander Dennis Enviro400s. Upon re-tendering, on 10 November 2007 it passed to London General's Stockwell garage. Alexander Dennis Enviro400H hybrids were introduced to the route in early 2009.London steps up hybrid trials :: Bus and Coach Magazine On 11 February 2008, a bus on diversion had its roof removed after the driver drove into the side rather than under the middle of an arch bridge.BBC News - \\"Six hurt as roof ripped from bus\\" Retrieved 12 February 2008 Transport for London said the diversion was safe if drivers followed instructions, and had been operating successfully for over 24 hours. This came three months after another 24 lost its roof in the same place while out of service.BBC News - Bus roof ripped off by low bridge A night element to the route was introduced on 27 November 1999, in the form of route N24, to replace part of the withdrawn route N2 between Hampstead Heath and Pimlico. The N prefix was dropped during April 2004, thus making it a 24-hour route. In February 2010 it was reported that a Muslim bus driver, new to the country, pulled his 24 bus over near Gospel Oak, locked the passengers in and prayed to Mecca. The Sun newspaper had to pay out ¬£30,000 after allegedly misrepresenting the incidents, stating that the driver was a fanatic who had forced passengers off the bus.

Luxembourg City, home to 1,800 Britons, is the centre of the sport, and all of Luxembourg's club sides are situated in the city's metropolitan area. The dominant club is the Optimists Cricket Club, which plays in the Belgian league, and has won that country's league title on three occasions (1991, 1994, 1995). The Optimists, being the largest club in Luxembourg and the only one with its own ground, works in close cooperation with the Luxembourg Cricket Federation to help organise cricket in the Grand Duchy. The Optimists also organise other teams, which, whilst they play against the main side in the domestic tournament, will often pool their players with the Optimists' for matches against foreign opponents. The club plays at the Pierre Werner Cricket Ground, in Walferdange. The ground is named after the late Pierre Werner, a former Prime Minister of Luxembourg (1959‚Äì74, 1979‚Äì84). Werner had fallen in love with cricket when living in London in 1930, and went on to become the Honorary President of the OCC, which had been established when he was Prime Minister. Werner opened the OCC's new ground when it was opened in 1992. Widely viewed as the best cricket grounds in mainland Europe (excluding grounds in the Netherlands), the ground lies in the picturesque setting just ten minutes from Luxembourg City center. It boasts a large outfield (with two tracks laid on different bases), four practice bays, a clubhouse with catering facilities), a cricket/tennis pavilion and various other amenities.http://www.optimists.cc/location/default.aspx?locationID=2137 Luxembourgian cricket's governing body is the Luxembourg Cricket Federation (), which was established in 1993 to organise the game in Luxembourg and to promote it to the non-British population.

SPC was the enabling technology of electronic switching systems (ESS) developed in the Bell System in the 1950s, and may be considered the third generation of switching technology. Stored program control was invented by Bell Labs scientist Erna Schneider Hoover in 1954 who reasoned that computer software could control the connection of telephone calls.  History  Proposed and developed in the 1950s, SPC was introduced in production electronic switching systems in the 1960s. The 101ESS PBX was a transitional switching system in the Bell System to provide expanded services to business customers that were otherwise still served by an electromechanical central office switch. The first central office switch with SPC was installed at Morris, IL in a 1960 trial of electronic switching, followed shortly thereafter by the first Western Electric 1ESS switch at Succasunna, NJ in 1965. Other examples of SPC-based third generation switching systems include: British GPO TXE (various manufacturers), Metaconta 11 (ITT Europe) and the AKE, ARE and pre-digital (1970s) versions of the AXE telephone exchange by Ericsson and Philips PRX were large-scale systems in the public switched telephone network. SPC enables sophisticated calling features. As SPC exchanges evolved, reliability and versatility increased. Second generation exchanges such as Strowger, panel, rotary, and crossbar switches were constructed purely from electromechanical switching components with combinational logic control, and had no computer software control. The first generation were the manual switchboards operated by attendants and operators. Later crossbar systems also used computer control of their switching matrices and may be considered SPC systems as well. Examples include the Ericsson ARE 11 (local) and ARE 13 (transit) as well as the North Electric NX-1E & D Switches and the ITT Metaconta 11, once found throughout Western Europe and in many countries around the world. SPC technology using analog switching matrices was largely phased out in the 1980s and had disappeared from most modern networks by the late 1990s. Some such switches in countries like Russia or Ukraine may still be in service.) The addition of time-division multiplexing (TDM) decreased subsystem sizes and dramatically increased the capacity of the telephone network. By the 1980s, SPC technology dominated the telecommunications industry. Viable, fully digital switches emerged in the 1970s, with early systems, such as the French Alcatel E10 and Canadian Nortel DMS series going into production during that decade. Other widely adopted systems became available in the early 1980s. These included Ericsson AXE 10, which became the world's most popular switching platform, the Western Electric 5ESS used through the US and in many other countries, the German designed Siemens ESWD, the ITT System 12 (later rebranded Alcatel S12) and NEC NEAX all of which were widely used around the world. The British developed System X (telephony), and other smaller systems also emerged in the early 1980s. Some digital switches, notably the 5ESS and very early versions of Ericsson AXE 10, continued to use analog concentrator stages, using SPC-like technologies, rather than direct connections to the digital line cards containing the CODEC. Early in the 21st century the industry began using a 5th generation of telephony switching, as TDM and specialist hardware based digital circuit switching is being replaced by softswitches and voice over IP VoIP technologies. The principle feature of stored program control is one or multiple digital processing units (stored-program computers) that execute a set of computer instructions (program) stored in the memory of the system by which telephone connections are established, maintained, and terminated in associated electronic circuitry. An immediate consequence of stored program control is automation of exchange functions and introduction of a variety of new telephony features to subscribers. A telephone exchange must run continuously without interruption at all times, by implementing a fault- tolerant design. Early trials of electronics and computers in the control sub systems of an exchange were successful and resulted in the development of fully electronic systems, in which the switching network was also electronic. A trial system with stored program control was installed in Morris, Illinois in 1960. It used a flying-spot store with a word size of 18 bits for semi- permanent program and parameter storage, and a barrier-grid memory for random access working memory.A. E. Joel, An Experimental Electronic Switching System, Bell Laboratory Record, October 1958 p.359 The world‚Äôs first electronic switching system for permanent production use, the No.1 ESS, was commissioned by AT&T; at Succasunna, New Jersey, in May 1965. By 1974, AT&T; had installed 475 No. 1ESS systems. In the 1980s SPC displaced electromechanical switching in the telecommunication industry, hence the term lost all but historical interest. Today SPC is standard in all automatic exchanges. The attempts to replace the electromechanical switching matrices by semiconductor cross point switches were not immediately successful, particularly in large exchanges. As a result, many space division switching systems used electromechanical switching networks with SPC, while private automatic branch exchanges (PABX) and smaller exchanges used electronic switching devices. Electromechanical matrices were replaced in the early 21st century by fully electronic ones. Types Stored program control implementations may be organized into centralized and distributed approaches. Early electronic switching systems (ESS) developed in the 1960s and 1970s almost invariably used centralized control. Although many present day exchange design continue to use centralized SPC, with advent of low cost powerful microprocessors and VLSI chips such as programmable logic array (PLA) and programmable logic controllers (PLC), distributed SPC became widespread by the early 21st century. Centralized control In centralized control, all control equipment is replaced a central processing unit. It must be able to process 10 to 100 calls per second, depending on the load to the system. Multiprocessor configurations are commonplace and may operate in various modes, such as in load-sharing configuration, in synchronous duplex-mode, or one processor may be in stand-by mode. Standby mode Standby mode of operation is the simplest of a dual-processor configuration. Normally one processor is in standby mode. The standby processor is brought online only when the active processor fails. An important requirement of this configuration is ability of standby processor to reconstitute the state of exchange system when it takes over the control; means to determine which of the subscriber lines or trunks are in use. In small exchanges, this may be possible by scanning the status signals as soon as the standby processor is brought into action. In such a case only the calls which are being established at the time of failure are disturbed. In large exchanges it is not possible to scan all the status signals within a significant time. Here the active processor copies the status of system periodically into secondary storage. When switchover occurs the recent status from the secondary memory is loaded. In this case only the calls which change status between last update and failure are affected. The shared secondary storage need not to be duplicated and simple unit level redundancy would suffice. 1ESS switch was a prominent example. Synchronous duplex mode In synchronous duplex mode of operation hardware coupling is provided between two processors which execute same set of instructions and compare the results continuously. If mismatch occurs then the faulty processor is identified and taken out of service within a few milliseconds. When system is operating normally, the two processors have same data in memories at all times and simultaneously receive information from exchange environment. One of the processor actually controls the exchange, but other is synchronized with the former but does not participate in the exchange control. If a fault is detected by the comparator the processors are decoupled and a check-out program is run independently to find faulty processor. This process runs without disturbing the call processing which is suspended temporarily. When one processor is taken out then the other processor operates independently. When the faulty processor is repaired and brought in service then memory contents of the active processor are copied into its memory and the two are synchronized and comparator is enabled. It is possible that a comparator fault occurs only due to transient failure which is not shown even when check out program is run. In such case three possibilities exists: *Continue with both processors: This is based on the assumption that the fault is transient and may not appear again. *Take out the active processor and continue with the other. *Continue with active processor but remove other processor from service. When a processor is taken out, it is subjected to extensive testing to identify a marginal failure. Load-sharing mode In load-sharing operation, an incoming call is assigned randomly or in a predetermined order to one of the processors which then handles the call right through completion. Thus, both the processors are active simultaneously and share the load and the resources dynamically. Both the processors have access to the entire exchange environment which is sensed as well as controlled by these processors. Since the calls are handled independently by the processors, they have separate memories for storing temporary call data. Although programs and semi permanent data can be shared, they are kept in separate memories for redundancy purposes. There is an inter processor link through which the processors exchange information needed for mutual coordination and verifying the 'state of health‚Äô of the other. If the exchange of information fails, one of the processors which detect the same takes over the entire load including the calls that are already set up by the failing processor. However, the calls that were being established by the failing processor are usually lost. Sharing of resources calls for an exclusion mechanism so that both the processors do not seek the same resource at the same time. The mechanism may be implemented in software or hardware or both. Figure shows a hardware exclusion device which, when set by one of the processors, prohibits access to a particular resource by the other processor until it is reset by the first processor.  Distributed control  Distributed SPC is both more available and more reliable than centralized SPC. The control function are shared by many processors within the exchange. It uses low cost microprocessors. Exchange control may decomposed either horizontally or vertically for distributed processing. In vertical decomposition the whole exchange is divided into several blocks and a processor is assigned to each block. This processor performs all tasks related to that specific block. Therefore, the total control system consists of several control units coupled together. For redundancy, processors may be duplicated in each block. In horizontal decomposition each processor performs only one or only some exchange functions.

The purpose of a military staff is mainly that of providing accurate, timely information which by category represents information on which command decisions are based. The key application is that of decisions that effectively manage unit resources. While information flow toward the commander is a priority, information that is useful or contingent in nature is communicated to lower staffs and units. Computer security industry This term is also in common use within the computer security industry and in the context of cyberwarfare. Here the term refers to the influence an attacker has over a compromised computer system that they control. For example, a valid usage of the term is to say that attackers use \\"command and control infrastructure\\" to issue \\"command and control instructions\\" to their victims.

As one of the longer state highways, it traverses the state east-west from Greenwood to Dillon, connecting the cities of Newberry, Winnsboro, Camden, Bishopville and Darlington. Route description SC 246 and SC 248 in Ninety Six SC 34 begins as a hidden highway in downtown Greenwood, at the intersection of Main Street and Maxwell Avenue. On city and state official maps, SC 34 is on an east parallel to U.S. Route 25 Business (US 25 Bus.) and US 178 Bus. along Main Street with some sections being in concurrency; however, no signage identifies this unique relationship, thus the hidden status for . At the intersection of Main Street and Ninety Six Highway, the first signage of SC 34 appears, heading east to Ninety Six. SC 34 travels through the town of Ninety Six and near the Ninety Six National Historic Site. Near Newberry, it takes a bypass route along Dixie Drive and Wilson Road, before continuing east to Winnsboro. Now going southeast, it goes through Ridgeway, to Lugoff, where it overlaps with US 1/US 601 to Camden. Continuing east and parallel to Interstate 20 (I-20), SC 34 joins with US 15 at Bishopville and skirts north of Lee State Park. East of Lydia, SC 34 separates from US 15 and goes directly to Darlington. Heading in a northeasterly direction now, it goes through Brownsville then east into downtown Dillon, where it ends at the intersection of Main Street and Second Avenue. History An original part of the South Carolina state route system, in 1922 the road ran from Darlington to Ridgeway. In 1933 the road was extended to Dillon and about 1943 a bridge over the Pee Dee river was opened. In the early 1950s the road was extended to Greenwood, creating the current configuration. SC 34 was bypassed south around Newberry in 1976 and the original route through the town remained as SC 34 Business. The first part of the road to be paved was the section though Camden in 1929. Over the next several years other parts were paved until the road was fully paved by the early 1940s. During the past several decades, much of the route has been widened to four lanes. Junction list Special routes Newberry business loop SC 34 Business was established in 1976, following the old mainline route through downtown Newberry, via Boundary Street, Caldwell Street and Main Street. Sometime between 2006-2010 the route was decommissioned. Newberry connector SC 34 Connector (SC 34 Conn.) is an unsigned connector route southwest of downtown Newberry. It travels along Dixie Drive for between Kendall Street (SC 121) and SC 34. Darlington truck route South Carolina Highway 34 Truck (SC 34 Truck) is a truck route that is partially within the city limits of Darlington, which is in the southeastern part of Darlington County. It has concurrencies with U.S. Route 52 and US 401\\\\. The truck route begins at the northern end of the exit ramp from SC 34/SC 151 (Harry Byrd Highway) to US 52/US 401 (Governor Williams Highway). This interchange is just east of Darlington Raceway. This ramp heads to the south-southeast and crosses over Indian Creek before merging into US 52/US 401\\\\. The three highways travel to the southeast and have an intersection with Lamar Highway. At this intersection, US 401 splits off to the southwest, while US 52 and SC 34 Truck continue to the southeast. This intersection is also the western terminus of SC 34 Connector (SC 34 Conn.), which takes Lamar Highway to the northeast. They begin a curve to the east-southeast and pass Brockington Elementary School. They have an intersection with SC 340 (known as Timmonsville Highway south of this intersection and Washington Street north of it). They travel through rural areas of the southern part of the city. Then they temporarily leave the city limits of the city and cross over some railroad tracks of the Carolina Piedmont Railroad and Limit Street. During the brief re-entering of Darlington, they intersect US 52 Bus. (South Main Street north). At this intersection, US 52 turns right and takes South Main Street tot the south- southeast, while SC 34 Truck continues to the east-southeast. The highway leaves Darlington and curves to the east. It crosses over some railroad tracks of South Carolina Central Railroad (SCRF) and then curves to the southeast. It crosses over the SCRF rail line again before intersecting South Charleston Road. Here, SC 34 Truck turns left and travels to the north-northwest. It curves to the north-northeast and crosses over Black Creek on the Williamson's Bridge. It travels through Howards Crossroads and then crosses over Back Swamp. After crossing over Alligator Creek, it curves to the north-northwest and enters Mechanicsville. Here, the truck route reaches its eastern terminus, an intersection with SC 34\\\\. Here, the roadway continues as North Charleston Road. Darlington connector SC 34 Connector (SC 34 Conn.) is a connector route southwest of downtown Darlington. The highway is named Lamar Highway and connects U.S. Route 401 (US 401), at its intersection with US 52, with SC 34/SC 151\\\\. Though it is not signed with a typical auxiliary signage plate and SC 34 shield, green highway signs at both ends denote the road as the \\"34‚Äì401 Connector.\\" It begins at an intersection with US 52, US 401, and SC 34 Truck in the extreme southwestern part of Darlington, which is in the southeastern part of Darlington County. It travels to the northeast. An intersection with Hart Street provides access to SC 34 west and SC 151\\\\.

Palisot collected insects in Oware, Benin, Saint Domingue, and the United States, during the period 1786‚Äì1797. Trained as a botanist, Palisot published a significant entomological paper entitled, \\"Insectes Receuillis en Afrique et en Amerique \\". Together with Frederick Valentine Melsheimer, he was one of the first entomologists to collect and describe American insects. He described many common insects and suggested an ordinal classification of Insects. He described many Scarabaeidae as well as illustrating them for the first time. The study included 39 Scarabaeus species, 17 Copris species, seven Trox species, four Cetonia and four Trichius. Familiar beetles such as Canthon viridis, Macrodactylus angustatus and Osmoderma scabra were first described by him. Many of the specimens that were labelled from America, were from Africa, and vice versa. He created type localities in America for species such as Dynastes hercules (L.), well outside the natural range. Palisot's expeditions were described inter alia by Chase (1925) and Merrill (1937) and a summary is provided here to explain the uncertain origins of his material. Palisot trained as a lawyer but pursued postgraduate studies in botany under Jean- Baptiste Lestiboudois in Lille and Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in Paris. He also did important early work on the classification of lycopods, notably the Lycopodiaceae and Selaginellaceae. Early years After finishing his studies he was appointed advocate to the Parlement of Paris in 1772, and afterward receiver general. He then devoted himself to the study of natural history, especially botany. Africa In 1786 he set out to found a colony at Oware at the mouth of the Niger River in what is today called Nigeria. Palisot merged specimens from there with collections from neighbouring Benin. At intervals he sent material back to France, including the first liverwort specimens to be collected from Africa and sent to Europe. Among his collections is a leaf bearing the type specimens of two epiphytic leafy liverworts, one of which has never again been collected. However, most of his collection was destroyed when the British invaded the colony and razed the trading post where his material was kept. An epidemic of yellow fever spread through the colony. Haiti Palisot became so debilitated with yellow fever that in 1788 he was placed on a slave ship bound for Haiti where he had an uncle in Cap-fran√ßais, and where he made the acquaintance of another French botanist, Guillaume Silvestre Delahaye. He recovered and returned to his collecting. He was admitted into the colonial assembly and the superior council, opposed the abolition of the slave trade, and in 1790 wrote a pamphlet in which he accused English philanthropists of sinister motives in supporting this project. On the eve of the Haitian Revolution he also went to the United States to ask the aid of the government in reducing the Haitian slaves to obedience. On his return from this useless mission in June 1793, he found the island in insurrection. An uprising by slaves resulted in the town being burnt, as was his uncle's home and Palisot's collections. Palisot was imprisoned, but later freed under order of deportation. Because of his title, Palisot understandably was reluctant to return to France in the aftermath of the Revolution. United States He boarded a ship bound for the United States and on the voyage was robbed of his remaining worldly goods and arrived in Philadelphia totally destitute. He joined a circus as a musician to earn some money, and finally obtained work curating the private botanical collection of the painter Charles Willson Peale. He joined the American Philosophical Society, contributed to its Transactions, and resumed his collecting with the sponsorship of the French minister, Pierre Adet, a scientist in his own right. Palisot's collecting trips in the United States ranged from the Ohio River in the west to Savannah, Georgia in the south. He made several valuable discoveries, including that of a new species of rattlesnake, and he passed several months among the Creek and Cherokee Indians. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society, to which he communicated a part of his observations. Palisot finally received word from Paris that his citizenship had been restored, and began planning his return to Europe, especially the freighting of his collections. Dogged by misfortune, these collections were lost in a shipwreck off Nova Scotia in 1798. Palisot returned to France in the same year. France Using material that had survived all the disasters, as well as his sketches, he published a number of booklets on plants and insects, between 1805 and 1821. Griffin (1932, 1937) supplies the date of publication for each booklet which consisted of five to six plates, each depicting six or nine of the insects described in the text, and it is through these sketches, rather than by specimens, that Palisot's species are often identified. Palisot invented a new method of classification for insects, and proposed another for quadrupeds. He observed the details of the reproductive organs in mosses, and, as the existence of these organs was denied, he confirmed his first researches by new observations. Few of Palisot's specimens have survived. His botanical specimens were sent to the Jardin Botanique at Geneva. The herbarium at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences has sheets that are marked \\"Beauv.\\", but show plants native to India, a place never visited by Palisot. Therefore, Palisot must have incorporated specimens from other collectors, which would explain the strange origin of some of the insects from his collection. Horn & Kahle (1937) state that some of Palisot's beetles, the Elateridae, were later sent by Pierre Fran√ßois Marie Auguste Dejean to Frederick DuCane Godman and Osbert Salvin at the British Museum of Natural History to be included in the Biologia Centrali-Americana. Specimens were also sent by Louis Alexandre Auguste Chevrolat to Neervoort van de Poll of the Netherlands, and these in turn were bequeathed to the British Museum of Natural History, but none of Palisot's specimens has been found there. \\\\---- ;Author abbreviation for plant and animal taxa named by Palisot de Beauvois: Publications *Ueber die Einwohner des K√∂nigreichs Benin auf der Westk√ºste des Tropischen Afrika [As to the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Benin on the West Coast of Tropical Africa].

Appearance  They are small rounded beach pebbles made of quartzite, which have been painted with simple designs in a dye which is now dark brown in colour. The size varies from to . It has not proven possible to analyse the dye itself from the stains that remain. The motifs are carefully executed and the most common are dots and wavy lines. Other motifs are small circles, pentacles, crescents and triangles, showing strong relationships with the Pictish symbol stone motifs. Experimental archaeology suggests that the designs were likely to have been painted with peat tar.  Distribution  To date, 55 painted pebbles have been found. 11 of these were found in Caithness, 5 in Orkney and 27 in Shetland. Most have come from broch sites which have been shown to have had an extensive post-broch occupation. An ogham-inscribed spindle-whorl was associated with one find at Buckquoy in Orkney (see Buckquoy spindle whorl). Several have been associated with wheelhouses or their outbuildings. An example was found at a Pictish site at Buckquoy in Orkney as reported in 1976. It had the \\"small ring\\" type decoration.  Cultural significance  Scottish painted pebbles have been dated to the period 200 AD to the eighth century AD, the Pictish period. They may have been sling-stones that were thought to be of magical nature by the Picts; however, local traditions suggest that they were \\"charm-stones\\", often known as \\"cold-stones\\". Such stones were used within living memory to cure sickness in animals and humans. In the Life of St. Columba it is recorded that he visited King Bridei in Pictland in around the year 565 AD and, taking a white stone pebble from the River Ness, he blessed it and any water it came into contact with would cure sick people. It floated in water and cured the king from a terminal illness. It remained as one of the great treasures of the king and cured many others.

In this system twelve voice channels are multiplexed in a high frequency carrier and passed through a balanced pair trunk line similar to those used for individual voice frequency connections. The original system is obsolete today, but the multiplexing of voice channels in units of 12 or 24 channels in modern digital trunk lines such as T-1 is a legacy of the system. The twelve channel scheme was first devised in the early 1930s to provide a line spectrum covering 60 to 108 kHz for the Type J Carrier Telephone System, an equivalent four wire (on two wire facilities) open wire carrier that was used almost exclusively for interstate long haul toll telephony. This became the basic building block, the \\"channel group\\", for all succeeding long haul systems, such as Type K and all the Type L systems into the late 1970s. All long haul \\"channel groups\\" used the single-sideband/suppressed carrier heterodyne scheme that was produced by a Western Electric Type A-1 through A-6 channel bank. The twelve channel scheme, in order to maintain some bandwidth and routing compatibility, was carried through to the short haul carriers, as well, as they started developing to eliminate voice band open wire trunk lines in the 1950s. The Bell System vacuum-tube driven N-1 Carrier of the early 1950s was the most used twelve channel carrier system, using double sideband/unsuppressed carrier operation which didn't need network timebase synchronization to maintain frequency accuracy. N-2 was similar in heterodyning scheme, but in discrete transistorized \\"plug-in unit\\" architecture, while N3 used the same frequency plan but a scheme of using single sideband with a different voice channel on each side of the carrier, a technique first seen on the 16 channel Type \\"O\\" open wire short haul carrier of the 1950s. This doubled the capacity to 24 channels, the same as a basic digital Type T PCM carrier introduced in the late 1950s, which became the now- ubiquitous \\"T-1\\" of the digital world. Repeaters were spaced approximately 6 miles (10 km) apart, depending on wire gauge. With few exceptions, N-carriers used 19 gage unloaded toll pairs in two-wire operation. Each repeater either received from both directions at a low frequency band and sent in both directions at a higher band, or vice versa. This frequency frogging allowed equivalent four-wire operation on a single cable pair in two-wire operation. During the period when Type N-1 was in widespread use, Lenkurt Corporation, owned and controlled by General Telephone, fielded a variant competitor, the Type BN. BN used the same pairs and repeaters as did the Bell N-CXR, but used four channel \\"groups,\\" lower single-sideband heterodyning, and 24 channels per carrier, as later seen on Western Electric's Type N-3. Type BN was used at times by Bell Operating Companies after the 1956 Hush-a-phone Decision of the US Supreme Court, a landmark case which challenged AT&T;'s \\"benign monopoly\\" of US telephone equipment industry. Part of this settlement was for AT&T;'s Bell Operating Companies to buy and use small amounts of Lenkurt and Collins microwave and carrier systems. In California, Type BN was used almost exclusively to provide trunk and private line connections between Pacific Tel. & Tel. toll offices and local General Telephone end offices.

The domed Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue is to the right, rear. Porat Yosef Yeshiva () is a Sephardic yeshiva in Jerusalem, with locations in both the Old City and the Geula neighborhood. The name Porat Yosef means \\"Joseph is a fruitful tree\\" after the biblical verse Genesis 49:22. History Yeshivat Ohel Moed, cofounded by Rabbis Ezra Harari-Raful and Refael Shelomo Laniado in Jerusalem in 1904, was the forerunner to Porat Yosef Yeshiva. Harari-Raful also opened another yeshiva in 1918 that merged with Porat Yosef in 1923. The cornerstone for Porat Yosef Yeshiva was laid in Jerusalem's Old City in 1914. Yosef Shalom, a philanthropist from Calcutta, India, originally bought the site overlooking the Temple Mount with the intention of building a hospital. When he wrote to the Ben Ish Chai of Baghdad for his opinion, the sage persuaded him to endow a yeshiva instead.Surasky, Aharon (1996). Ve‚Äôzos La‚ÄôYehuda. Jerusalem, p. 47. Construction was delayed, however, due to World War I; the yeshiva was finally inaugurated in 1923.Sutton (2005), p. 64. The sprawling campus consisted of a large beth midrash (study hall); two smaller study halls for a kollel for married students; and 50 other rooms including dormitories, offices and a library. Destruction and rebuilding The Arab Legion attacking the Porat Yosef Yeshiva, May 1948. In May 1948, shortly after the start of the Israel War of Independence, the yeshiva building was attacked and destroyed by the Arab Legion. After the war's conclusion in 1949, a new home was established for the yeshiva in the Geula neighborhood, at the corner of Malkhei Yisrael and Yosef Ben Mattityahu Streets. Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli architect Moshe Safdie designed a new campus on the yeshiva's original site in the Old City, though the Geula site was retained and now the two run in parallel. The new building, based on the original design, blends tradition with modern styling. In both texture and colour, the stone walls echo the dominant building material of Jerusalem. The synagogue itself is a substantial structure of six stories, seating 450 worshippers. The edifice is covered by a large, semitransparent dome which permits light to enter by day, while at night it glows with interior illumination. Curriculum The yeshiva bases its curriculum on the study of Talmud, poskim (decisors of cases in Jewish law) and the commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch. Roshei yeshiva Geula branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva. The first rosh yeshiva of Porat Yosef in 1923 was Rabbi Refael Shelomo Laniado. Upon his death in 1925, Rabbi Ezra Attiya succeeded him as rosh yeshiva, a position he held until his death in 1970. The Old City branch of the yeshiva was subsequently led by Rabbi Ben- Zion Meir Hai Uziel, who was succeeded by Rabbi Shalom Cohen, the current rosh yeshiva. The Geula branch was headed by Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka from 1970-1983; he was followed by Rabbi Ben Zion Abba Shaul, who led the Geula branch until his death in 1998. Today the rosh yeshiva of the Geula branch is Rabbi Moshe Tzadka.

Heritage The name Colsterworth is from the Old English 'colestre' + 'worth' for \\"enclosure of the charcoal burners\\"; the name appears as \\"Colsteuorde\\" in the Domesday Book. The village dates from the Roman era. It is close to Ermine Street, the old Roman road that ran from London directly north to Lincoln and to the Roman road known as High Dyke.

The surrounding churchyard has been closed for almost a century, but is kept in order by the Parish Council.

Tofurky is a trademark of Turtle Island Foods, a company based in Hood River, Oregon, United States. Turtle Island has come to also use the brand name for most of its meatless products, such as deli slices, sausages, jerky, tempeh (its first product), burgers, and franks. All of the Tofurky products are fully vegan and approved by the Vegan Society, and most are kosher-certified by the Kosher Supervision of America. The product name is a portmanteau of \\"tofu\\" and \\"turkey\\" into a single word which sounds like a spoonerism of \\"faux turkey\\". History Seth Tibbott founded Turtle Island Foods in 1980, having become a vegetarian while in college, and the Tofurky product was introduced in 1995.

Nutritional information for equal servings of Tofurky and equivalent meat products is available online, allowing interested people to compare sodium, fat, cholesterol, and protein. The company does not use trans fat and the product has no cholesterol since it is 100% vegan. Turtle Foods has indicated that it no longer uses certain controversial soy products and only uses non-GMO soybeans. The roast is vegan, which also means it is suitable for those with egg or milk allergies; but for those who suffer from allergies to the soy and/or wheat gluten used in most meat alternatives, Tofurky is not an option (see the end of the page for alternatives). Preparation The Tofurky is pre-stuffed and sealed at the ends to enclose the stuffing. It cooks in one hour and fifteen minutes if thawed or three hours and fifteen minutes if frozen. Because the product has a uniform texture, it slices easily. Tofurky is seitan and soy based and was created to have a texture similar to that of meat products; the vegetable-based turkey-like flavorings are intended to make it comparable to traditional Thanksgiving fare. In order to make the product as similar to flesh as they intended, its creators designed the roast so that it tears off at a forty-five degree angle with the grain.

It belongs to the most important works of D√ºrrenmatt and is a classic among the surrealistic short stories. With the beginning of the story, D√ºrrenmatt parodies Thomas Mann. The first sentence is very long and nested. Furthermore, D√ºrrenmatt's student is in a train and likes cigars ‚Äì just like the young man in The Magic Mountain (Der Zauberberg). Synopsis The protagonist is a 24-year-old student, a fat and cigar-smoking loner, who boards his usual train to reach his university, but surprisingly, when the train enters a very small tunnel, the tunnel doesn‚Äôt end. The darkness continues for ten minutes, fifteen minutes, twenty minutes. The student gets nervous, but the other passengers are calm, because they don‚Äôt see (or don‚Äôt want to see) the imminent catastrophe. The student finds the train conductor, and questions him about what is going on with the train. The conductor is evasive at first, but eventually leads the student to the locomotive, which is empty. The conductor tells the student that the engineer already jumped when he realized what was happening to the train. After a failed attempt to pull the emergency brake, the train gets faster and faster, tipping into an abyss. Finally, the train is heading completely vertically and the falling student lands on the front glass of the still falling locomotive, where he greedily stares into the oncoming darkness. The train conductor, ever concerned with duty, asks what they should do, but the student answers: ‚ÄúNothing (...) God let us fall. And now we'll come upon him.‚Äù Later, D√ºrrenmatt abridged the ending. In the second version, first published in 1978, the last two sentences (one sentence in the German original: \\"Gott lie√ü uns fallen, und so st√ºrzen wir denn auf ihn zu\\") are omitted and the story ends with the word \\"Nothing\\". Interpretation The racing train could be interpreted as every life that inescapably approaches a catastrophe (death, the unknown). Terror can be breaking in a life without warning, and the people hide themselves behind banality. The last sentence of the story interprets this terror as the will of God, but that does not make the terror clearer. Another interpretation is the story is a social commentary on the ignorance of society in the face of imminent disaster, as people place unquestioning trust in leaders without concern for where they are being led. The last sentence spoken by the student comments on the fall of the ultimate authority figure, God, and how placing trust in falsely constructed authority will only result in the downfall of society.

It was an obligatory subject of study in all institutions of higher education in the Soviet Union, as a seminal work of dialectical materialism, a part of the curriculum called \\"Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Philosophy\\". Lenin argued that human perceptions correctly and accurately reflect an objective external world. Lenin formulates the fundamental philosophical contradiction between idealism and materialism as follows: \\"Materialism is the recognition of 'objects in themselves' or objects outside the mind; the ideas and sensations are copies or images of these objects. The opposite doctrine (idealism) says: the objects do not exist, outside the mind '; they are 'connections of sensations'.\\"W. I. Lenin: Materialism and empirio-criticism. Critical remarks about a reactionary philosophy . Publisher for foreign language literature, Moscow 1947. p. 14. Background The book, whose full title is Materialism and Empirio-criticism. Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy, was written by Lenin from February through October 1908 while he was exiled in Geneva and London and was published in Moscow in May 1909 by Zveno Publishers. The original manuscript and preparatory materials have been lost. Most of the book was written when Lenin was in Geneva, apart from the one month spent in London, where he visited the library of the British Museum to access modern philosophical and natural science material. The index lists in excess of 200 sources for the book. In December 1908, Lenin moved from Geneva to Paris, where he worked until April 1909 on correcting the proofs. Some passages were edited to avoid tsarist censorship. It was published in Imperial Russia with great difficulty. Lenin insisted on the rapid distribution of the book and stressed that \\"not only literary but also serious political obligations\\" were involved in its publication. The book was written as a reaction and criticism to the three-volume work Empiriomonism (1904‚Äì1906) by Alexander Bogdanov, his political opponent within the Party. In June 1909, Bogdanov was defeated at a Bolshevik mini-conference in Paris and expelled from the Central Committee, but he still retained a relevant role in the Party's left wing. He participated in the Russian Revolution and after 1917, he was appointed director of the Socialist Academy of Social Sciences. Materialism and Empirio- criticism was republished in Russian in 1920 with an introduction attacking Bogdanov by Vladimir Nevsky. It subsequently appeared in over 20 languages and acquired canonical status in Marxist‚ÄìLeninist philosophy.  Chapters summary  ;Chapter I: The Epistemology of Empiriocriticism and Dialectical Materialism I Lenin then discusses the \\"solipsism\\" of Mach and Avenarius. ;Chapter II: The Epistemology of Empiriocriticism and Dialectical Materialism II Lenin, Tschernow and Basarov confront the views of Ludwig Feuerbach, Joseph Dietzgen and Friedrich Engels and comment on the criterion of practice in epistemology. ;Chapter III: The Epistemology of Empiriocriticism and Dialectical Materialism III Lenin seeks to define \\"matter\\" and \\"experience\\" and addresses the questions of causality and necessity in nature as well as \\"freedom and necessity\\" and the \\"principle of the economy of thought\\". ;Chapter IV: The philosophical idealists as collaborators and successors of empirio-criticism Lenin deals with left and right Kant criticism, with the philosophy of immanence, Bogdanov's empiri-monism, and the critique of Hermann von Helmholtz on the \\"theory of symbols.\\" ;Chapter V: The latest revolution in science and philosophical idealism Lenin deals with the thesis that \\"the crisis of physics\\" \\"has disappeared matter\\". In this context he speaks of a \\"physical idealism\\" and notes (on p. 260): \\"For the only\\" property \\"of matter to whose acknowledgment philosophical materialism is bound is the property of being objective reality, outside of our consciousness.\\" ;Chapter VI: Empiriocriticism and Historical Materialism Lenin discusses authors such as Bogdanov, Suvorov, Ernst Haeckel and Ernst Mach. In an addition to Chapter IV, Lenin addresses the question: \\"From what side did N. G. Chernyshevsky criticize Kantianism?\\" Impact At the time of publication the book had little impact.

In its original acceptation, it signified the proprietor of a heritable subject, but, in the law relating to parish government, the term was confined to such proprietors of lands or houses as were liable, as written in their title deeds, for the payment of public burdens, such as the minister's stipend, manse and glebe assessments, schoolmaster's salary, poor rates, rogue-money (for preventing crime) as well as road and bridge assessments, and others like public and county burdens or, more generally, cess, a land tax.Bell, page 676 A liferenterBell, page 531 might be liable to cess and so be entitled to vote as an heritor in the appointment of the minister, schoolmaster, etc. The occasional female landholder so liable was known as a heritrix. In Scotland the term heritor was used to denote the feudal landholders of a parish until the early 20th century. For example, in the early 20th century the heritors of the Highland Parish of Crathie and Braemar were the estates of Mar Lodge, Invercauld, Balmoral, and Abergeldie. Historically, land-holding in Scotland is feudal in nature, meaning that all land is technically \\"owned\\" by the Crown, which, centuries ago, gave it out ‚Äì feued it ‚Äì to various tenants-in- chief in return for specified services or obligations. These obligations became largely financial in time, or ceremonial or at least notional. Similarly, these tenants-in-chief gave parcels of land out to lesser \\"owners\\", and the resulting reciprocal obligations too became financial ‚Äì feudal dues ‚Äì or notional. Often, though, conditions were imposed by the feudal superior at the time of the transaction ‚Äì used in the 19th century as a form of planning control. The result was that \\"landowners\\" had differing rights to the land they \\"owned\\". However, those who held their land without limit of time ‚Äì that is, only had a ceremonial or ancient financial obligation towards their notional \\"superiors\\" ‚Äì were distinguished from others and were called heritors. In effect, they were the gentry of the Scots countryside, with legal privileges and obligations. Most ordinary farmers rented their land for a specific period of time from the heritors. Like the gentry in other countries, the heritors ruled the countryside. They were responsible for justice, law and order in their district and for keeping the roads in good repair. They were responsible for appointing ‚Äì and paying ‚Äì the minister and the schoolmaster, and for maintaining the church, manse and schoolhouse. They had also to provide for the poor of their parish. For all this they levied a rate on all the heritors in the parish ‚Äì and often included non-heritor tenant farmers in the rate.

Early years Kand started his music career as a drummer, but \\"...had to progress to other instruments as time went by just to create the sounds I wanted to hear, whether that be keyboards, or horns, or guitars, or anything I could put my hands on.\\" Pompeii 99 In 1981, aspiring vocalist Gitane Demone placed an ad in Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler, saying, \\"female vocalist available.\\" The ad was answered by Kand, who had recently graduated from high school. The pair formed the band Pompeii 99. Kand was fascinated by Nostradamus and took the band's name from a prophecy. Kand and Demone found drummer David Glass (aka David Parkinson) through auditions and also worked with members Cram Netod (Marc Doten) and Poli-Sci (Polly Klemmer). Pompeii 99 gained an audience in the L.A. club scene, and released their 1981 debut album, Look at Yourself on their own Nostradamus label, which was financed in part by their parents. In 1982, they followed this with a 7\\" EP, Ignorance Is the Control. Pompeii 99 was scheduled to open for Christian Death on a European tour, but when the band's lineup collapsed, leader Rozz Williams decided along with Kand, Demone and Glass to combine the two bands into a new version of Christian Death. Christian Death Christian Death in performance Kand stayed with the band when it joined with Williams in 1983 to become the new lineup of Christian Death.The rough guide to rock, p. 194 (3d ed. 2003)Issit, Michael L. Goths: A Guide to an American Subculture, p. 94 (2011) The band went on to record their next two albums, 1984's Catastrophe Ballet with bassist Constance Smith and 1985's Ashes with bassist Randy Wilde. In mid-1985, Kand took over leadership of the band after Williams left, working as lead vocalist and songwriter. With bassist Johann Schumann and guitarist/keyboardist Barry Galvin, the band recorded an EP for the Italian label Supporti Fonografici called The Wind Kissed Pictures, credited to \\"The Sin and Sacrifice of Christian Death\\". The EP was later reissued in Germany and the U.S., credited only to Christian Death. The band's full-length post- Williams release was 1986's Atrocities, a concept album about the aftereffects of World War II on the European psyche. This was followed by 1987's The Scriptures, recorded by a revamped lineup of Kand, Demone, Glass, guitarist James Beam and bassist Kota. During this period, the band found their biggest successes on the UK Indie Chart with the 1987-89 singles \\"Sick of Love\\", \\"Church of No Return\\" and \\"Zero Sex\\" and the 1988 album Sex and Drugs and Jesus Christ. Following release of the \\"Zero Sex\\" single, Demone split from both Kand and Christian Death in 1989. In the early 1990s, Williams attempted to reclaim the Christian Death name. However, Kand already had the rights to the name due to Williams' departure from the group and subsequent neglect of the moniker. Williams billed his version of the band as \\"Christian Death Featuring Rozz Williams\\". Williams committed suicide on April 1, 1998, after his close friend and associate Erik Christides died of an overdose.http://www.gothic.at/artikel/stories/rozz-williams-malaise- music.html,628 Valor continued performing and recording with Christian Death, issuing the two-part concept work All the Love, All the Hate in 1989 and the 1990 album Insanus, Ultio, Proditio, Misercordiaque, on which Kand conducted the English Abbey Choir and the Commonwealth Chamber Orchestra.See the booklet which accompanies Insanus, Ultio, Proditio, Misercordiaque The band added bassist Maitri in 1991. Her first concert with Christian Death took place at the Contemporary Festival, held at the Anfitheatro delle Cascine in Florence, Italy on 12 July 1991. The band released the Sexy Death God album in 1994, the double-live set Amen in 1995, the Nostradamus-themed Prophecies in 1996, and Pornographic Messiah in 1998. In 2000, the band added drummer Will Sarginson and toured Europe with Britain's Cradle of Filth in support of their Born Again Anti Christian album. In 2002 Valor Produced an album by Maitri, black metal/deathrock act Lover of Sin, releasing the album Lover of Sin. For Christian Death's 2003 tour, they added Cradle of Filth guitarist Gian Peres to the lineup. In 2007, the band released the American Inquisition album, featuring new drummer Nate Hassan. In 2014, Christian Death embarked on the 30th Anniversary Catastrophe Ballet tour, beginning in Europe and continuing through to the year's end in North, South and Central America. In August 2015, the band released the PledgeMusic album The Root of All Evilution. Personal life Kand is an ex-lover of Gitane Demone, with whom he had two children, Sevan Kand and Zara Kand.

DeMone's music career spans more than 30 years. She came to prominence in the mid 1980s as keyboardist and backing vocalist of the influential deathrock band Christian Death. In addition to her work with Christian Death, Demone has previously been a member of Pompeii 99, worked with Dreadful Shadows, and has had a solo career which has included three studio albums: Am I Wrong?, Stars of Trash and The Reflecting Shadow. Early years In high school, she discovered the works of Billie Holiday, and played and sang with local bands at parties, including Ledger from Downey, California. After high school, she became a writer and illustrator. Around 1980, DeMone became interested in songwriting and singing. She wrote songs with the aid of a small Casio keyboard and started her singing career with a heavy metal band. After one performance without amplification, she found that she had damaged her voice and went in search of singing lessons. During lessons with a teacher whose favorite singer was Barbra Streisand, DeMone found a few useful techniques and changed her singing style. Pompeii 99 In 1981, DeMone placed an ad in The Recycler newspaper, reading \\"female vocalist available\\".

Solo career In 1989, DeMone relocated to Amsterdam and began a solo career, combining her background in punk, deathrock and gothic rock with a passion for jazz and legendary female vocalists, most notably Billie Holiday. She maintained a rubber-clad S&M; visual image, and the fetish theme carried through into her lyrics. DeMone's first two solo releases, the \\"A Heavenly Melancholy\\" maxi- single (1992, Torso Dance) and Lullabies for a Troubled World EP (1993, Cult Music), were collected, along with some 1993 live tracks, as the 1993 Cleopatra Records compilation Facets in Blue. She also issued two live albums during this period,Love for Sale (1993, Cult Music) and With Love & Dementia (Live in Cannes 1994) (1995, Hypnobeat). She renewed her friendship with former Christian Death band member Williams, and the pair toured together and recorded the album Dream Home Heartache in 1995, which included both cover versions and their own material. DeMone then paired up with Mark Ickx to produce a studio album, Never Felt So Alive, released in 1994; it was reissued under the title Demonix in 1996 by Cleopatra. In 1996, DeMone recorded her first studio album, Am I Wrong?, released by Apollyon in 1998. The following year she released a second studio album, Stars of Trash (Andromeda), composed by DeMone and recorded with the assistance of the band Dreadful Shadows. In 2008, a two-disc DVD by DeMone titled Life After Death was released by Cult Epics, featuring footage from throughout her career, including a live performance with Williams. From 2008-2011, DeMone was involved in a project called the Crystelles with daughter Zara Kand, and also performed with the experimental noise band +DOG+. In 2013, she collaborated with Loopool and Syphilis Sauna under the name Hedone Tears, self-releasing a digital single, \\"Moonlit Paradise\\". \\"Moonlit Paradise\\", backed by an untitled track, was released again in 2015 as the Hedone Tears 7\\" single (Mystic Moon Records), under her own name. As the Gitane DeMone Quartet, DeMone currently records and performs backed by other musicians including Rikk Agnew, Paul Roessler (The Screamers, etc.) and Deb Venom. A published writer, DeMone's other artistic activities also include composing poetry and painting. Personal life Besides being partners in Pompeii 99, DeMone and Kand were married in 1983. They had a son together, Sevan Kand (n√© 1984), and later a daughter, Zara Kand. DeMone became engaged to fellow former Christian Death member Rikk Agnew on May 3, 2013.

It is part of the Malay Archipelago and is located at the southern tip of Peninsular Malaysia. The island forms the bulk of the country in terms of area and population, since there are hardly any other residential areas situated on the smaller islands. With a population of 5,469,700 and an area of 710 square kilometres, Mainland Singapore is the 20th most populous island in the world and the 31st most densely populated island in the world. Etymology Pulau Ujong was the earliest reference to Singapore Island.

In table tennis, speed glue is a glue that is used to re-fix the rubber surfaces to the racket or paddle. Speed glue is usually applied around 30 minutes before a match starts. The use of speed glue has been found to increase the elasticity of the racket, which adds speed and spin to the ball. Speed glue works by its solvent vapours which make the porous cells of soft rubber expand. This stretches the rubber giving it a tension that in turn makes the ball behave like an object meeting a trampoline. It was discovered by accident in the 1970s when a player used bicycle puncture repair glue to fix his racket before a match. The difference in the play of the ball became immediately obvious. The high performance effect lasts only a few hours. Table tennis player Dragutin Surbek of Yugoslavia is given the major credit for popularising this use of speed glue between 1979 and 1983. Speed glue was allowed for the last time in the 2008 Summer Olympics. From the 2012 Olympic games, speed glue is banned in the Olympics. Description Speed glue is an adhesive used to assemble table tennis rackets in a manner to make them hit balls back with increased speed. It is optional; a person may choose to use regular glue instead. Its use in tournaments is currently disputed due to believed toxicity in some speed glues. The theory behind speed glue is that it is soaked up by the sponge layer between the rubber topsheet and blade of a table tennis paddle. The sponge begins to expand, and consequently begins to stretch the attached rubber topsheet causing increased tension and creating a \\"trampoline\\" effect on the ball causing it to bounce back quicker. Speed glue use is generally more common among advanced table tennis players. The increased speed of the strokes of the paddle is usually too great for beginners to handle. Professional players who use speed glue generally apply it to their paddle a few hours before their match because the effects of speed glue do not last long. The effects last usually 3‚Äì6 hours, although recently long life glues have been developed to prolong the effect for up to 4 days. Offensive players tend to use speed glue more than defensive players as they emphasise speed over spin and control. Generally, speed is inversely proportional to control, although this depends largely on ability. Speed glue needs to be reapplied several times to have an optimal effect. The nature of speed glue is very unpredictable, so several coats are needed to make the bounce of the paddle more predictable. When professionals are seen applying speed glue to their paddles before a tournament, they have applied speed glue to it several times before that time. Softer sponge rubbers will gain a larger performance boost from speed glue than harder rubbers. The use of speed glue will, over time, degrade the quality of the rubber so persistent use will mean the rubbers will need to be replaced sooner. Speed glue is mixed with certain solvents to create a better effect. Some of these solvents are illegal and contain potentially hazardous vapors. They are considered to be inhalants. In 1995, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) banned the use of all halogenated solvents, all solvents with benzene rings, and N-hexane in paddles. They have also started the practice of random testing of paddles in international tournaments checking for the aforementioned solvents. The amount of increase the glue will give a rubber is dependent on the sponge. Softer sponged rubber, e.g. Yasaka's MarkV 30, Butterfly's Bryce FX, Joola's Samba, will absorb the glue more readily and therefore have a bigger dome when they expand, leading to a greater effect, with harder sponges e.g. most Chinese rubbers, Butterfly's Bryce Hard, expanding less leading to a slightly lesser effect. In gameplay terms, speed glue has some disadvantages. Due to the increased sponge thickness, speed does increase, but as mentioned before usually control decreases as speed increases. Also, after several regluings speed glue begins to build up on the racket, increasing the weight of the paddle. The nature of table tennis blades are so sensitive, that a few extra grams may cause the player to not perform as well. The more the glue builds up on the rubber, the more glue must be applied on the next application to achieve the same effect. After 5-10 layers of glue, some players peel the old glue off to reduce the weight of the sponge, and to reduce the amount of glue needed to obtain the optimum effect. Another disadvantage is that the increased tension on the sponge from the glue will cause the rubber to wear out faster than usual. In order to prolong the life of the rubber, some players remove the rubber from the blade after they play to allow the rubber to contract naturally, rather than remain stressed on the blade. Spotting speed glue is very difficult at times. If the paddle makes a very distinctive high-pitched sound on contact, then the paddle may have speed glue. When holding the paddle, the person may notice an increase of weight from normal paddles. Also, there is a distinct smell that is given off from some speed glues when used. Regulation In 2004, the ITTF decided to ban any glues containing volatile organic solvents as of 1 September 2007 due to health concerns. The date had been moved back to 1 September 2008. This has spurred on a new line of products by table tennis manufacturers to innovate and develop water based speed glues and rubber sheets with speed glue effect built in that last the lifetime of the rubber. VOC glues are still allowed when done under regulated conditions i.e. at the manufacturer. On 27 June 2007, the International Table Tennis Federation banned all speed glue containing \\"volatile compounds\\" effective immediately in response to an unconfirmed health incident in Japan.

The club plays the Gaelic games of Gaelic football, hurling in both men's and women's codes. History In December 1884, one month after the G.A.A. was founded, a group of men gathered in Clondalkin to form a Gaelic Football Club. Among those present were David Molloy, J. Wixted, J. Carroll, J. Keogh, C. Ryder, P. Doran, The Errity Brothers one of whom, Tom, was later to win All-Ireland Senior medals with Dublin in '92', '94, '98, '99 and 1902. Towers won their first competition, the Baltyboys Tournament in 1889. They won their first Dublin Trophy ‚Äî the Junior League in 1910 with Matt Nolan as captain. They won the Junior League and Junior Championship in 1926, again with Matt Nolan as captain. Success in the Leixlip Tournament of 1928 is noteworthy because St. Mary's Leixlip included the two Kildare \\"greats\\" Larry Stanley and Matt Goff. The Club had attained Senior status in the thirties and three of its members, Tom Dowd Paddy Hickey and Billy Dowling played for Dublin and Leinster. The Club lost the 1941 Junior Championship but won the 1942 League to regain Senior status. They contested the Intermediate Championship finals in 1948, 1950 and 1951 and defeated O'Dwyers in the I.L.F. in 1951, and went on to win the Dublin Intermediate Football Championship in 1952. Winners of the Under 21 Dublin Championship in its inauguration year 1964, this same team challenged strongly for senior championship honours up to 1970. G. Freyne. P. Barrett, G. Gray, D. Keating, T. Higgins and C. Dowling were all prominent members of that team. This feat was repeated 25 years later in 1989 when the club won the Under 21 A championship for the second time.

The SAOA publishes a journal, the South Australian Ornithologist as well as the Birds SA Newsletter \\"the Birder\\". It holds regular monthly meetings and conducts field trips for members. Its is also involved in many conservation projects throughout South Australia to help protect local bird species and their habitats. History The SAOA was founded in Adelaide in 1899 and is the oldest birding association in Australasia, pre-dating the founding of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union, now known as BirdLife Australia by two years. 1960 schism A period of uncertainty occurred in the association in the late 1950s when issues relating to the taking of birds from the wild became a matter of concern to many members. This concern led ultimately to a split in the membership and the formation of the Adelaide Ornithologists which remains as a separate group in Adelaide although the original reason for the schism has long been forgotten. On one side were those who urged for greater legislative protection for rare avicultural species, such as parrots and finches. On the other were people, including many aviculturists, who felt threatened by a proposal they saw would bring greater control over their hobby - and for those in the avicultural trade, their livelihoods. Eventually, after three stacked meetings in which control of the association swung between one side and the other, a poll of the membership reflected the mood for enhanced protection and the avicultural lobby was defeated. Consequently, some members broke away from the SAOA and formed the Adelaide Ornithologists Club in 1960. Activities The SAOA has over 800 members and holds monthly meetings at the Hawker Centre in the Waite Institute of the University of Adelaide. It also organises regular excursions to birding sites in South Australia and holds campouts at least twice a year. Many of Australia's leading ornithologists, including Richard Schodde, Leo Joseph, Lyn Pedler, Andrew Black and David Paton, started their careers with the SAOA and continue as important contributors to its work and interests. SAOA (Birds SA) is a member group of the Conservation Council of South Australia. Birds SA (SAOA) affiliated with BirdLife Australia (formerly RAOU) in March 2018, the aim is to collaborate on many conservation issues for Australian birds species and protection of their habitats, primarily in SA, but throughout Australia as well.

It was built in the 1870s by Kolel Shomrei HaChomos, an organization of Hungarian Jews, but was abandoned after the riots of 1938. Although the building was destroyed after 1948, it has recently been acquired by a Religious Zionist group for refurbishment and was reopened after restoration work finished in October 2008. Establishment In 1862 students of the Chassam Sofer, Rabbi Moses Sofer, arrived in Jerusalem from Hungary and established a community called Shomrei HaChomos, meaning Guardians of the Walls. During the 1870s they built a synagogue situated about 100 meters from the Temple Mount on el-Wad Street, in today‚Äôs Muslim Quarter. The courtyard was purchased from the Muslim Khaladi family. Rabbi Yitzchok Ratsdorfer, a diamond merchant who belonged to the Hasidic group Belz, financed the building. In 1892 the community established a neighborhood outside the Old City walls called Batei Ungarin, part of the neighborhood now known as Meah Shearim. In 1904 the synagogue in the Old City was expanded and a second story was added. While construction was taking place, the Ottoman authorities warned that the extension would not be allowed. They opposed the fact that its roof would end up being taller than the Dome of the Rock. Construction of the roof was completed overnight, ensuring that the synagogue would be finished. Turkish law stated that once a building had been erected, it could no longer be demolished. The building accommodated a yeshiva on the ground floor called Ohr Meir and its students held study sessions 24 hours a day. The top floor accommodated two prayer rooms, one for the Chasidim, who use Nusach Sefard, and one for the Perushim, who use Nusach Ashkenaz. The building also contained a mikvah. Abandonment Although the riots of 1920 and 1929 disturbed the running of the yeshiva and synagogue, Jews still frequented the building until Arab violence forced them to vacate the premises during the 1938 riots. Members relocated to Meah Shearim, and the building was rented to Arabs until the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The synagogue was almost totally destroyed during the ensuing 19 years of Jordanian rule. Its members relocated their entire organization, Kolel Shomrei HaChomos, to other locations in the city, including Meah Shearim, Givat Shaul, and more recently Ramat Shlomo, where they built new buildings and synagogues called Kiryas Shomrei HaChomos. Kolel Shomrei HaChomos is closely affiliated with the Edah HaChareidis and considered part of it. Rededication In 1967, after the Six-Day War, all that remained intact was the ground floor of the building, which was turned into a Jewish book store. Years later the Religious Zionist organization Ateret Cohanim encouraged an American charity funded by American Jewish businessman Irving Moskowitz, a regular donor to right-wing groups in East Jerusalem, to buy the building. The organization then gave the Western Wall Heritage Foundation the right to manage the synagogue site and the excavations.Haaretz article In October 2008 the synagogue was officially reopened. The current building is an exact replica of the original synagogue. See also * Kolel Shomrei HaChomos * Edah HaChareidis Sources *Rossoff, Dovid.

The population of the civil parish (including Ompton and Ossington) at the 2011 Census was 489. Laxton is best known for having the last remaining working open field system in the United Kingdom. Its name is recorded first in the Domesday Book as Laxintone, and may come from Anglo- Saxon Leaxingat≈´n, meaning the \`farmstead or estate of the people of a man called Leaxa'. It is possibly the namesake of the town of Lexington, Massachusetts, and thus ultimately of all the other towns named Lexington in the United States. Features The village has the remains of a Norman motte and bailey castle (Laxton Castle) and is also the site of the Beth Shalom Holocaust Centre. In addition, there are the remnants of a substantial system of fish-ponds, presumed to have belonged to the castle or to the manor house built later on the site of it, two medi√¶val mill mounds, and ridge-and-furrow earthworks. St Michael the Archangel's Church, Laxton, mostly dates back to the 12th century; after this, the earliest known standing structure is a farmhouse dating from 1703. Most of the village's architecture sits firmly in the local vernacular tradition, with nearly a fifth of the buildings dating from the 18th century, and around 40% from each of the 19th and 20th. Conservation Status of Laxton 'Laxton Fields' has been designated a target area for Higher Level Stewardship by Natural England to promote conservation of the historic landscape and biodiversity. Open fields Laxton parish today has much conventionally farmed land but retains also a significant part of the mediaeval open field system. Fields, divided into strips, are farmed in common among the landowners of the village.Beckett, J.V. (1989) A history of Laxton : England's last open-field village, Oxford : Basil Blackwell, Today, there are three open fields remaining; the Mill Field, the South Field and the West Field. A 1635 survey of the parish carried out by Mark Pierce (still extant and held in the Bodleian Library) shows that these three fields were in use at that date, but that they were significantly larger than their current size. There was also a fourth field, the East Field, which was considerably smaller than the others, and farmed as part of the West Field.Orwin, C.S. and Orwin, C.S. (1938) The open fields, Oxford : Clarendon Press, 332 p. This was fully enclosed, and today is a number of small fields. The strips within the fields have also changed significantly, with changes in technology. Originally, a single strip would have represented approximately a single day of ploughing; such a strip today would be far too small to be really practical for a tractor-drawn plough. Instead, over time, strips have been consolidated to provide workable parcels of land; the result today is that the average strip size has increased significantly over mediaeval times. However, the practical aspects of open field farming are still very much what they would have been 500 years ago. Laxton is unique because the open field system is still alive and in daily use. Although the village is now recognised as an important heritage site, it is home to working farmers, who rely on the land for their income. While modern expectations and needs mean that all the farmers own land outside the open fields, the open fields are not part of a museum or showcase but a living part of the agricultural landscape. The system is protected today by a Parliamentary undertaking given by the Crown Estate Commissioners on their 1981 purchase of the Laxton estate and by a Countryside Stewardship agreement held between the Court Leet and the then-Countryside Commission. The sykes, four areas of grassland, are also protected by SSSI status. Laxton's strip fields were depicted on a postage stamp designed by David Tress that was issued in 1999 by the Royal Mail as part of their Millennium stamp series; the stamp also doubled as Royal Mail's contribution to that year's Europa postage stamp issue with the theme of Parks and Reserves.

A feature of the garden is a black stone on which are inscribed the names of the Nazi death camps. The vision for the centre came when James and Stephen Smith visited Israel with their parents. Some time later, on another visit, they saw Yad Vashem, and were inspired to build a memorial in Britain. The centre is also home to the Aegis Trust, an all-party group working for genocide prevention. One of their interests is in Kigali, Rwanda.

The title character was a boy with a tendency to destroy things and who was reminiscent of Dennis The Menace from The Beano, though when he destroyed things it usually tended to be by accident rather than design. Initially Smasher had a bright red hairstyle that was similar to that of Dennis, though it soon changed to being black. He wore a similar sort of jumper to Roger the Dodger, albeit it is a diamond pattern rather than chequered pattern. The strip was first drawn by Hugh Morrenhttps://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/morren_hugh.htm in 1958, who drew it until 1984 when Dave Gudgeon took over. He drew the strip until 1986, after which the strip was handed over to Brian Walker, around the time \\"The\\" was dropped from the title. Walker made some changes to the character, giving Smasher a more teenaged look, a slightly longer hairstyle and a jacket in place of his jumper; his attitude was also toned down somewhat (The character was rewritten to be a more accident-prone figure), as the editor felt that he had become too openly malicious by that time. Walker carried on drawing the strip for most of the next two decades; its appearances became more sporadic in the late 1990s however, and the strip was finally dropped completely with the comic's relaunch in 2004.

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. crime film directed by Ulu Grosbard and starring Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall as the brothers Spellacy, a priest and police detective. Produced by Chartoff-Winkler Productions, it is adapted from the novel of the same name by John Gregory Dunne, loosely based on the Black Dahlia murder case of 1947. Dunne wrote the screenplay with his wife, novelist Joan Didion. The film was released on September 25, 1981. Plot In 1948, Rev. Desmond Spellacy is a young and ambitious Roman Catholic monsignor in the Los Angeles archdiocese. His older brother Tom is a hard-working homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. They are fond of each other, but spend little time together. Des is the pride and joy of aging Cardinal Danaher because of his skill at developing church projects while keeping down costs. He cuts a corner now and then, overlooking the shady side of construction mogul Jack Amsterdam, a lay Catholic who uses his ties to the Monsignor for the congregation's benefit but mainly for his own. One day in Los Angeles, a young woman is found brutally murdered, her body cut in two in a vacant lot. Tom Spellacy and his partner, Frank Crotty, are put in charge of the case. The woman, Lois Fazenda, is labeled \\"the Virgin Tramp\\" by the local press for apparently being a Catholic as well as a prostitute, turning it into a sensational case. Tom Spellacy's investigation leads him to a local madam, Brenda Samuels. Tom was well acquainted with Brenda years earlier while working as a bagman for Amsterdam, whose corruption extends to the local prostitution ring. Brenda has called the police to report the death of a Catholic priest while he was engaging the services of one of her girls. While there, Brenda reproaches Tom for doing nothing for her while she was sent to prison for running one of Jack's whorehouses. Tom later believes the dead girl appeared in a stag film and obtains a copy. He and Frank notice that one of the girls in the movie was present at Brenda's brothel on the day they came to retrieve the philandering priest. Tom now wants Brenda's help in tracking down the girl who made the movie with the murdered girl. Frank spots the girl a few days later being taken into the jail entrance after a roundup. They learn that the dead girl was a favorite of a local porno movie director named Standard because of her tattoo. Tom learns that Standard did his filming in a deserted army post in the foothills outside Los Angeles. At lunch with his brother, Tom provokes Amsterdam with secret facts about Amsterdam's dark side, which makes the Monsignor increasingly uncomfortable. Des tells the Cardinal the time has come to cut church ties with Amsterdam for good. Des discusses \\"getting rid of Jack\\" with his cronies who remind him that such a thing would not be easily done. Sonny, a corrupt local city council member and local mortician, proposes that they give Jack a salutation dinner. Tom Spellacy's anger builds as his brother organizes a Catholic \\"layman of the year\\" banquet for Amsterdam as a gesture of appreciation before ending the church's relationship with him. Tom walks up to Amsterdam at the banquet and pulls off his sash while asking him loudly: \\"Were you wearing this when you were banging Lois Fazenda?\\" Jack attacks Tom and they scream obscenities at each other. Tom goes to Standard's \\"studio\\" and finds the floor and a bathtub covered with dried blood. He also finds Chinese food, which the medical examiner doing the autopsy had found in her stomach. Tom and Frank go looking for Standard but learn that he had been killed in a car accident twelve hours after the murder. Tom wants to drag in Amsterdam for questioning simply to humiliate him in public but Frank talks him out of it. Tom starts digging around and discovers that the dead girl had been messing around with several community leaders. Amsterdam's lawyer, Dan Campion, subtly warns the Monsignor that his brother the cop had better lay off unless they want it revealed publicly that Des, too, knew the murdered girl. She met the Monsignor only once in passing, whereas she had a sexual relationship with both Amsterdam and the lawyer. But the simple fact that Des had any kind of involvement in such a lurid case could permanently stain his reputation with the church. Tom Spellacy won't be talked out of it. His determination becomes complete when Brenda is found dead, an apparent suicide. He decides to have Amsterdam picked up and taken to headquarters, which in turn leads to the Monsignor being treated the same way. His rising career curtailed, Des asks to be relocated to a remote parish in the desert, the same place to which his mentor in the diocese had been exiled, the location where the movie begins and ends, where Des and Tom meet after years apart. By the time Tom comes to see him, Des is dying. Tom feels everything is his fault, but Des is at peace and absolves his brother of any and all blame. Cast * Robert De Niro as Msgr.

Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". New York Times critic Vincent Canby declared the film \\"a reminder of just how good commercial American movies can be when the right people come together.\\" Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times gave the film 3 stars out of 4. He wrote that while the performances were good and some individual scenes very well-crafted, the movie as a whole was disappointing: \\"the attentions of the filmmakers were concentrated so fiercely on individual moments that nobody ever stood back to ask what the story was about. It's frustrating to sit through a movie filled with clues and leads and motivations, only to discover at the end that the filmmakers can't be bothered with finishing the story.\\" The film was panned by William F. Buckley, Jr., who had praised the original novel.Judis, John William F. Buckley, Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives, pg. 437 In his review of the film in the National Review, Buckley reportedly \\"bemoaned the film's depiction of a priest as a murder suspect, and the broader 'ideologization of religion' in contemporary culture\\"Rosen, James (2008-07-30) W-Hef-B: Bill Buckley, Playboy, and the Struggle for the Soul of America, RealClearPolitics and \\"complained that \\"Robert De Niro is badly miscast.

While the concept faded for a while, it has been introduced with a new range of vehicles for both standard and metre gauge lines. Many autorails from the 1950s and 1960s form the basic transport of many French preserved railways, of Chemin de Fer Touristique (sometimes Historique). They can be used at times of year when steam locos might cause fires. They have quick availability and do not require the specialized infrastructure needs of steam locomotives. Many lines have both steam and diesel traction, but steam is often reserved for peak periods and weekends. The power of these machines allows them to pull a small number of trailers if passenger loads necessitate. X4200 Panoramique The Panoramique at Ambert in the Auvergne region of France.

Under certain conditions, the set of the CM is unique and complete (at least theoretically) and thereby capable of describing the behavior of a studied object in full. This article deals with characteristic mode decomposition in electromagnetics, a domain in which the CM theory has originally been proposed.  Background  CM decomposition was originally introduced as set of modes diagonalizing a scattering matrix. The theory has, subsequently, been generalized by Harrington and Mautz for antennas. Harrington, Mautz and their students also successively developed several other extensions of the theory. Even though some precursors were published back in the late 1940s, the full potential of CM has remained unrecognized for an additional 40 years. The capabilities of CM were revisited in 2007 and, since then, interest in CM has dramatically increased. The subsequent boom of CM theory is reflected by the number of prominent publications and applications.  Definition  For the simplicity, only the original form of the CM ‚Äî formulated for perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) bodies in free space ‚Äî will be treated in this article. The electromagnetic quantities will solely be represented as Fourier's images in frequency domain. Lorenz's gauge is used. Example of a scatterer \\\\Omega composed of a perfect electric conductor. The scattering of an electromagnetic wave on a PEC body is represented via a boundary condition on the PEC body, namely : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{E}^\\\\mathrm{i} = -\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{E}^\\\\mathrm{s}, with \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{n}} representing unitary normal to the PEC surface, \\\\boldsymbol{E}^\\\\mathrm{i} representing incident electric field intensity, and \\\\boldsymbol{E}^\\\\mathrm{s} representing scattered electric field intensity defined as :\\\\boldsymbol{E}^\\\\mathrm{s} = -\\\\mathrm{j}\\\\omega\\\\boldsymbol{A} - abla\\\\varphi, with \\\\mathrm{j} being imaginary unit, \\\\omega being angular frequency, \\\\boldsymbol{A} being vector potential : \\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\right) = \\\\mu_0 \\\\int\\\\limits_\\\\Omega \\\\boldsymbol{J} \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r}'\\\\right) G \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r}, \\\\boldsymbol{r}'\\\\right) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}S, \\\\mu_0 being vacuum permeability, \\\\varphi being scalar potential : \\\\varphi \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\right) = - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{j}\\\\omega\\\\epsilon_0} \\\\int\\\\limits_\\\\Omega abla\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{J} \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r}'\\\\right) G \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r}, \\\\boldsymbol{r}'\\\\right) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}S, \\\\epsilon_0 being vacuum permittivity, G \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r},\\\\boldsymbol{r}'\\\\right) being scalar Green's function : G \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r},\\\\boldsymbol{r}'\\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\mathrm{j}k\\\\left|\\\\boldsymbol{r} - \\\\boldsymbol{r}'\\\\right|}}{4\\\\pi \\\\left|\\\\boldsymbol{r} - \\\\boldsymbol{r}'\\\\right|} and k being wavenumber. The integro-differential operator \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{E}^\\\\mathrm{s} \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{J} \\\\right) is the one to be diagonalized via characteristic modes. The governing equation of the CM decomposition is : \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{J}_n\\\\right) = \\\\lambda_n \\\\mathcal{R} \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{J}_n\\\\right) \\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(1)} with \\\\mathcal{R} and \\\\mathcal{X} being real and imaginary parts of impedance operator, respectively: \\\\mathcal{Z}(\\\\cdot) = \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\cdot) + \\\\mathrm{j}\\\\mathcal{X}(\\\\cdot)\\\\,. The operator, \\\\mathcal{Z} is defined by : \\\\mathcal{Z} \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{J}\\\\right) = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{n}} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{E}^\\\\mathrm{s} \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{J}\\\\right). \\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{(2)} The outcome of (1) is a set of characteristic modes \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol{J}_n\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, n\\\\in \\\\left\\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, accompanied by associated characteristic numbers \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_n\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Clearly, (1) is a generalized eigenvalue problem, which, however, cannot be analytically solved (except for a few canonical bodies). Therefore, the numerical solution described in the following paragraph is commonly employed.  Matrix formulation  Discretization \\\\mathcal{D} of the body of the scatterer \\\\Omega into M subdomains as \\\\Omega^M = \\\\mathcal{D}\\\\left(\\\\Omega\\\\right) and using a set of linearly independent piece-wise continuous functions \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\psi}_n\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, n\\\\in\\\\left\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,N\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, allows current density \\\\boldsymbol{J} to be represented as Example of a scatterer's triangular (Delaunay) discretization \\\\Omega^M. : \\\\boldsymbol{J} \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\right) \\\\approx \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n=1}^N I_n \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\psi}_n \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\right) and by applying the Galerkin method, the impedance operator (2) : \\\\mathbf{Z} = \\\\mathbf{R} + \\\\mathrm{j} \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\left[Z_{uv}\\\\right] = \\\\left[\\\\,\\\\int\\\\limits_\\\\Omega \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\psi}_u^\\\\ast \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{Z} \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\psi}_v\\\\right) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}S\\\\right]. The eigenvalue problem (1) is then recast into its matrix form : \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{I}_n = \\\\lambda_n \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\mathbf{I}_n, which can easily be solved using, e.g., the generalized Schur decomposition or the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method yielding a finite set of expansion coefficients \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{I}_n\\\\right\\\\\\\\} and associated characteristic numbers \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_n\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. The properties of the CM decomposition are investigated below. The first (dominant) characteristic mode of a shape \\\\Omega^M. The second characteristic mode of a shape \\\\Omega^M.  Properties  The properties of CM decomposition are demonstrated in its matrix form. First, recall that the bilinear forms : P_\\\\mathrm{r} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mathbf{I}^\\\\mathrm{H} \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\mathbf{I} \\\\geq 0 and : 2\\\\omega\\\\left(W_\\\\mathrm{m} - W_\\\\mathrm{e}\\\\right) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mathbf{I}^\\\\mathrm{H} \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{I}, where superscript ^\\\\mathrm{H} denotes the Hermitian transpose and where \\\\mathbf{I} represents an arbitrary surface current distribution, correspond to the radiated power and the reactive net power, respectively. The following properties can then be easily distilled: * The weighting matrix \\\\mathbf{R} is theoretically positive definite and \\\\mathbf{X} is indefinite. The Rayleigh quotient : \\\\lambda_n \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{I}_n^\\\\mathrm{H}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{I}_n}{\\\\mathbf{I}_n^\\\\mathrm{H}\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\mathbf{I}_n} then spans the range of -\\\\infty \\\\leq \\\\lambda_n \\\\leq \\\\infty and indicates whether the characteristic mode is capacitive (\\\\lambda_n < 0), inductive (\\\\lambda_n > 0), or in resonance (\\\\lambda_n = 0). In reality, the Rayleigh quotient is limited by the numerical dynamics of the machine precision used and the number of correctly found modes is limited. * The characteristic numbers evolve with frequency, i.e., \\\\lambda_n = \\\\lambda_n \\\\left(\\\\omega\\\\right), they can cross each other, or they can be the same (in case of degeneracies ). For this reason, the tracking of modes is often applied in order to get smooth curves \\\\lambda_n \\\\left(\\\\omega\\\\right). Unfortunately, this process is partly heuristic and the tracking algorithms are still far from perfection. * The characteristic modes can be chosen as real-valued functions, \\\\mathbf{I}_n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times 1}. In other words, characteristic modes form a set of equiphase currents. * The CM decomposition is invariant with respect to the amplitude of the characteristic modes. This fact is used to normalize the current so that they radiate unitary radiated power : \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mathbf{I}_m^\\\\mathrm{H} \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\mathbf{I}_n \\\\approx \\\\left(1 + \\\\mathrm{j} \\\\lambda_n\\\\right) \\\\delta_{mn}. This last relation presents the ability of characteristic modes to diagonalize the impedance operator (2) and demonstrates far field orthogonality, i.e., : \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_0}{\\\\mu_0}} \\\\int\\\\limits_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\int\\\\limits_0^\\\\pi \\\\boldsymbol{F}_m^\\\\ast \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{F}_n \\\\sin \\\\vartheta \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\vartheta \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\varphi = \\\\delta_{mn}.  Modal quantities  The modal currents can be used to evaluate antenna parameters in their modal form, for example: * modal far-field \\\\boldsymbol{F}_n \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{e}}, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{r}}\\\\right) (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{e}} ‚Äî polarization, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{r}} ‚Äî direction), * modal directivity \\\\boldsymbol{D}_n \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{e}}, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{r}}\\\\right), * modal radiation efficiency \\\\eta_n, * modal quality factor Q_n, * modal impedance Z_n. These quantities can be utilized for analysis, feeding synthesis, radiator's shape optimization, or antenna characterization.  Applications and further development  The number of potential applications is enormous and still growing: * antenna analysis and synthesis, * design of MIMO antennas, * compact antenna design (RFID, Wi-Fi), * UAV antennas, * selective excitation of chassis and platforms, * model order reduction, * bandwidth enhancement, * nanotubes and metamaterials, * validation of computational electromagnetics codes. The prospective topics include * electrically large structures calculated using MLFMA, * dielectrics, * utilization of Combined Field Integral Equation, * periodic structures, * formulation for arrays.  Software  CM decomposition has recently been implemented in major electromagnetic simulators, namely in FEKO, CST-MWS, and WIPL-D. Other packages are about to support it soon, for example HFSS and CEM One. In addition, there is a plethora of in-house and academic packages which are capable of evaluating CM and many associated parameters.  Alternative bases  CM are useful to understand radiator's operation better. They have been used with great success for many practical purposes. However, it is important to stress that they are not perfect and it is often better to use other formulations such as energy modes, radiation modes, stored energy modes or radiation efficiency modes.

Centred on a village green, it is located in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester between Neston and Ellesmere Port, less than a mile south of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral boundary. It is located very closely to Eastham and Bromborough and just a short distance away from Neston. At the 2001 Census, the total population of Willaston and Thornton ward was 4,913. History Willaston (or Wilaveston) was the earlier nameOpen Domesday Map: Willaston Hundred of the Wirral Hundred (Hundred of Wilaveston), the peninsula's former administrative division, and one of the Hundreds of Cheshire. The Hundredal name is often taken from the administrative area for the Hundred, suggesting Willaston was once of some importance in the post- Roman period as the meeting place of the hundred court. Later the village became a township within the parish of Neston, the largest settlement on the Wirral until the early 19th century. Willaston included part of the hamlet of Badgers Rake, which became part of the civil parish of Ledsham in 1933. The population of Willaston was recorded at 196 in 1801, 317 in 1851, 597 in 1901 and 1,458 in 1951. The half timbered building, the 'Red Lion' was an inn built in 1631, although possibly a significant enlargement of an earlier construction. Located opposite the village green, it remained a public house until 1928 and was eventually renovated as a private residence. Willaston Windmill, built in 1800, was the largest windmill in Wirral. During the early 20th century it was used for the production of flour and to grind cattle food. It remained working until about 1930, when its sails were destroyed in a storm. The windmill has also since been converted into a private dwelling. Community Hadlow Road railway station, which served the village until its closure in 1955, became part of Wirral Country Park in 1973. The station building, signal box and eastbound platform have been renovated to their former 1950's condition. The former trackbed has become a public pathway, known as the 'Wirral Way'. The local school, Willaston Church of England Primary School, is the only educational establishment in the village, though there are several playgroups in the area. Willaston CofE Primary School . retrieved May 18th 2010. Although there are no secondary schools in the area, Wirral Grammar School for Girls and Wirral Grammar School for Boys are situated nearby, as well as Neston High School and South Wirral High School - both a short car journey from the village. Willaston's local football club plays in the West Cheshire Amateur Football League Division 2. The village has its own Festival Society, which launched its most successful festival in July 2009.

See drop-down essay on \\"The Third Republic and the 1905 Law of La√Øcit√©\\" Description This agreement saw the resolution of an impasse whereby the Vatican had refused to recognise the Associations Culturelles created by the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State extending the 1901 French law on associations; these laws had been accepted by the Jewish and Protestant religious bodies. The agreement made possible the forming of Associations Dioc√©saines with members appointed by the bishops. In the case of the Concordat dioceses of Strasbourg and Metz it has remained the French President who, after consultations with the Vatican, makes the appointments of diocesan bishops, which are published in the Journal officiel de la R√©publique Fran√ßaise. The Briand-Cerretti agreement came after the forced retirement of the saintly Benedictine bishop of Metz, Willibrord Benzler, in 1919 and only provides a very vague analogy for the depositions at the Liberation of France. Among the many consequences of this agreement was the reluctance to appoint ordinaries likely to call into question the spoliations and expropriations that the French church underwent between 1790 and 1905. The veto has been rarely used but its existence induces caution in nunciature circles when proposing candidates. Disagreements are known from time to time to occur, as mentioned by the former ambassador to the Vatican, Jean Gu√©genou, on France-Culture on 13 July 2009. The system also indirectly ensures that, almost without exception, French citizens alone are employed in Catholic administration and schools in France. The 1926 agreement also involved the maintenance of liturgical honours, such as seating and incensing, paid to French consular personnel in the former Ottoman territories, as at the Consulate General of France in Jerusalem.

The first theatre on the site opened in 1772, and the theatre was demolished in 1969, after being destroyed by fire. From 1865 to 1882, the theatre was known as the Prince of Wales's Theatre (not to be confused with Prince of Wales Theatre). Origins The theatre began on this site as The New Rooms where concerts were performed, in Charlotte Street, in 1772, under the management of Francis Pasquali. Popularity, and royal patronage led to the building's enlargement by James Wyatt, and its renaming as the King's Concert Rooms (1780‚Äì1786). It then became Rooms for Concerts of Ancient Music and Hyde's Rooms (1786‚Äì1802, managed by The Directors of Concerts and Ancient Music). In 1802, a private theatre club managed by Captain Caulfield, the \\"Pic-Nics\\", occupied the building and named it the Cognoscenti Theatre (1802‚Äì1808). It became the New Theatre (1808‚Äì1815) and was extended and fitted out as a public theatre, with a portico entrance on Tottenham Street. It opened on 23 April 1810 with Love in a Village. It continued under a succession of managers as the unsuccessful Regency Theatre (1815‚Äì1820), falling into decline. The theatre then reopened as the West London Theatre (1820‚Äì1831), Queen's Theatre (1831‚Äì1833, 1835‚Äì1837, and 1839‚Äì1865), and Fitzroy Theatre (1833‚Äì1835). The lessee of the theatre from 1839 to 1865 was a scenic artist, Charles James James, and the theatre became the home of lurid melodrama, being nicknamed The Dusthole.University of Kent, Theatre Collection accessed 12 Mar 2007University of Massachusetts, Theatre History accessed 12 Mar 2007University of Kent, Scala Theatre accessed 12 Mar 2007 Prince of Wales's Royal Theatre 1865‚Äì1882 In 1865, the theatre was renovated and named the Prince of Wales's Royal Theatre and this continued until it went dark in 1882.\\"Scala Theatre\\", Theatre Database, Theatre- architecture.eu, accessed 28 February 2017 It was demolished in 1903. In 1865, in partnership with Henry Byron, Effie Marie Wilton assumed the management of the theatre, having secured as a leading actor Squire Bancroft. He starred in J. P. Wooler's A Winning Hazard, among other works. Wilton provided the capital, and Byron wrote a number of plays. His first was a burlesque of La sonnambula. However, Wilton wanted to present more sophisticated pieces. She agreed to produce three more burlesques by Byron, while he agreed to write his first prose comedies, War to the Knife (a success in 1865) and A Hundred Thousand Pounds (1866). By 1867, Byron left the partnership.Thomson, Peter. \\"Byron, Henry James (1835‚Äì1884)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 19 December 2008Lee, Amy Wai Sum. \\"Henry J.

A number of prominent actors played at the theatre during this period, among them John Hare, Charles Coghlan, the Kendals, and Ellen Terry. A big success in 1881 was F. C. Burnand's The Colonel, which went on to run for 550 performances, transferring to the Imperial Theatre. In 1882, the theatre went dark, and from 1886 the theatre buildings were used as a Salvation Army Hostel, until it was demolished in 1903.

The main entrance was now in Charlotte Street, and the old portico in Tottenham Street became the stage door. The new theatre, designed by Frank Verity, opened in 1905, as The Scala Theatre, seating 1,139 and boasting a large stage. The new venture was not particularly successful, and became a cinema from 1911‚Äì1918, run by Charles Urban. In 1918, F. J. Nettlefold took over and ran the premises as a theatre again. It became known as the New Scala in 1923, with D. A. Abrahams as licensee for staging plays and showing films; he became owner in 1925. Amateur productions and pantomime were performed, and for a while the theatre became home to the Gang Show. During World War II, it again housed professional theatre, reverting to the Scala Theatre. After the war, under the management of Prince Littler, amateur productions returned, with Peter Pan being the annual pantomime. This continued until 1969 when, after a fire, it was demolished for the building of offices, known as Scala House. In 1964, the theatre was used by The Beatles for the concert sequences in the film A Hard Day's Night. References Further reading *Baker, Henry Barton.

Aviation insurance is insurance coverage geared specifically to the operation of aircraft and the risks involved in aviation. Aviation insurance policies are distinctly different from those for other areas of transportation and tend to incorporate aviation terminology, as well as terminology, limits and clauses specific to aviation insurance. History Aviation Insurance was first introduced in the early years of the 20th century. The first-ever aviation insurance policy was written by Lloyd's of London in 1911. The company stopped writing aviation policies in 1912 after bad weather at an air meet caused crashes, and ultimately losses, on those first policies.Wells, A. T. and Chadbourne, B. D. Introduction to Aviation Insurance and Risk Management (3rd). pp4. (2007). The first aviation policies were underwritten by the marine insurance underwriting community. The first specialist aviation insurers emerged in 1924. In 1929, the Warsaw Convention was signed. The convention was an agreement to establish terms, conditions, and limitations of liability for carriage by air; this was the first recognition of the airline industry as we know it today. Realising that there should be a specialist industry sector, the International Union of Marine Insurance (IUMI) first set up an aviation committee and later in 1934 created the International Union of Aviation Insurers (IUAI), made up of eight European aviation insurance companies and pools. US Airways Flight 1549 was written off after ditching into the Hudson River The London insurance market is still the largest single centre for aviation insurance. The market is made up of the traditional Lloyd's of London syndicates and numerous other traditional insurance markets. Throughout the rest of the world there are national markets established in various countries, each dependent on the aviation activity within each country. The United States has a large percentage of the world's general aviation fleet and has a large established market. According to the 2014 report from GAMA (General Aviation Manufacturers Association), there are 362,000 general aviation aircraft worldwide, and 199,000 (or roughly 55%) are based in the United States.2014 General Aviation Statistical Databook & 2015 Industry Outlook , General Aviation Manufacturers Association, Page 2 No single insurer has the resources to retain a risk the size of a major airline, or even a substantial proportion of such a risk. The catastrophic nature of aviation insurance can be measured in the number of losses that have cost insurers hundreds of millions of dollars (Aviation accidents and incidents). Most airlines arrange \\"fleet policies\\" to cover all aircraft they own or operate. Insurance fraud were the motives for suicidal passengers to crash Pacific Air Lines Flight 773, Continental Airlines Flight 11 and National Airlines Flight 2511. Types of insurance Aviation insurance is divided into several types of insurance coverage available.Cunningham, Herb: Understanding Aviation Insurance, The COPA Guide to Buying an Aircraft, 34th Edition, pages 74-77. Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, May 2009. Public liability insurance This coverage, often referred to as third party liability covers aircraft owners for damage that their aircraft does to third party property, such as houses, cars, crops, airport facilities and other aircraft struck in a collision. It does not provide coverage for damage to the insured aircraft itself or coverage for passengers injured on the insured aircraft. After an accident an insurance company will compensate victims for their losses, but if a settlement can not be reached then the case is usually taken to court to decide liability and the amount of damages. Public liability insurance is mandatory in most countries and is usually purchased in specified total amounts per incident, such as $1,000,000 or $5,000,000. Passenger liability insurance Passenger liability protects passengers riding in the accident aircraft who are injured or killed. In many countries this coverage is mandatory only for commercial or large aircraft. Coverage is often sold on a \\"per-seat\\" basis, with a specified limit for each passenger seat. Combined Single Limit (CSL) CSL coverage combines public liability and passenger liability coverage into a single coverage with a single overall limit per accident. This type of coverage provides more flexibility in paying claims for liability, especially if passengers are injured, but little damage is done to third party property on the ground. Ground risk hull insurance not in motion This provides coverage for the insured aircraft against damage when it is on the ground and not in motion. This would provide protection for the aircraft for such events as fire, theft, vandalism, flood, mudslides, animal damage, wind or hailstorms, hangar collapse or for uninsured vehicles or aircraft striking the aircraft. The amount of coverage may be a blue book value or an agreed value that was set when the policy was purchased. The use of the insurance term \\"hull\\" to refer to the insured aircraft betrays the origins of aviation insurance in marine insurance. Most hull insurance includes a deductible to discourage small or nuisance claims. Ground risk hull insurance in motion (taxiing) This coverage is similar to ground risk hull insurance not in motion, but provides coverage while the aircraft is taxiing, but not while taking off or landing. Normally, coverage ceases at the start of the take-off roll and is in force only once the aircraft has completed its subsequent landing. Due to disputes between aircraft owners and insurance companies about whether the accident aircraft was taxiing or attempting to take-off, this type of coverage has been discontinued by many insurance companies. In-flight insurance In-flight coverage protects an insured aircraft against damage during all phases of flight and ground operation, including while parked or stored. Naturally, it is more expensive than not-in-motion coverage, since most aircraft are damaged while in motion.

The AOC was formed with the explicit aim of promoting the study of birds. The pattern established in the early years and still maintained is that the club has an evening meeting and a Sunday outing each month except for December and January. Meetings typically include an address on a subject of relevance to ornithology, a section called bird notes devoted to recent sightings of interest, and \\"bird of the month\\", a section presented by a club member and offering a brief view of a particular bird species or bird family. Sunday outings visit local bird watching spots for identification in the field. Once a year there is a Spring Excursion for a week to an area further afield.

In artificial intelligence and law, legal norms are considered in computational tools to automatically reason upon them. In multi-agent systems (MAS), a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), a norm is a guide for the common conduct of agents, thereby easing their decision-making, coordination and organization. Since most problems concerning regulation of the interaction of autonomous agents are linked to issues traditionally addressed by legal studies, and since law is the most pervasive and developed normative system, efforts to account for norms in artificial intelligence and law and in normative multi-agent systems often overlap. Artificial intelligence and law With the arrival of computer applications into the legal domain, and especially artificial intelligence applied to it, logic has been used as the major tool to formalize legal reasoning and has been developed in many directions, ranging from deontic logics to formal systems of argumentation. The knowledge base of legal reasoning systems usually includes legal norms (such as governmental regulations and contracts), and as a consequence, legal rules are the focus of knowledge representation and reasoning approaches to automatize and solve complex legal tasks. Legal norms are typically represented into a logic-based formalism, such a deontic logic. Artificial intelligence and law applications using an explicit representation of norms range from checking the compliance of business processes and the automatic execution of smart contracts to legal expert systems advising people on legal matters. Multi-agent systems Norms in multi-agent systems may appear with different degrees of explicitness ranging from fully unambiguous written prescriptions to implicit unwritten norms or tacit emerging patterns. Computer scientists‚Äô studies mirror this polarity. Explicit norms are typically investigated in formal logics (e.g. deontic logics and argumentation) to represent and reason upon them, leading eventually to architecture for cognitive agents while implicit norms are accounted as patterns emerging from repeated interactions amongst agents (typically reinforced learning agents). Explicit norms are typically represented as a deontic statement that aims at regulating the life of software agents and the interactions among them. It can be an obligation, a permission or a prohibition, and is often represented with some dialect or extension of Deontic logic. At the opposite, implicit norms are social norms that are not written, and they usually emerge from the repetitive interactions of agents.

His work has been described as Liberal Catholicism and Vienna's first Catholic political movement. Biography He was born the son of devout Catholic parents at Lindenau (now part of Cvikov) in Bohemia. From 1796 to 1800 he attended the monastic school of the Piarists at Haide and from 1800 to 1803 the gymnasium of Leitmeritz. Subsequently he studied philosophy and jurisprudence at Prague. After completing these studies he became a tutor in the household of Prince Bretzenheim. The religious views of the young man had been sadly shaken during the years of his student life by his study of the modern systems of philosophy (Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Jacob and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling); but his removal in 1811 to Br√ºnn (Brno) near Vienna with the princely family mentioned above brought him under the influence of the parish priest of this place, named Korn, and particularly of Saint Clement Mary Hofbauer, and restored him to firm Catholic convictions. He then took up the study of theology, first at Vienna and afterwards at Raab (Gy≈ër) in Hungary, where in 1820 he was ordained to the priesthood. In 1822 he entered the Jesuit novitiate at Starawicz in Galicia, but left it in 1824. For the rest of his life he resided at Vienna as a private ecclesiastic, and until 1848 occupied a position in that city as a member of the State Board of Book Censorship. He died in Vienna. Work From 1818 G√ºnther was active in the world of letters as contributor to the \\"Viennese Literary Chronicle\\" (Wiener Jahrb√ºcher der Literatur). In 1828 began to appear the series of works in which he expounded his peculiar system of philosophy and speculative theology: *Vorschule zur speculativen Theologie des positiven Christenthums (Introduction to the Speculative Theology of Positive Christianity), in letter form; part I: \\"Die Creationstheorie\\" (The Theory of Creation); part II \\"Die Incarnationstheorie\\" (The Theory of the Incarnation) (1st ed., Vienna, 1828-9; 2nd ed., 1846-8); *Peregrins Gastmahl. Eine Idylle in elf Octaven aus dem deutschen wissenschaftlichen Volksleben, mit Beitr√§gen zur Charakteristik europ√§ischer Philosophie in √§lterer und neuerer Zeit (Vienna, 1830; new ed., 1850); *S√ºd- und Nordlichter am Horizont speculativer Theologie, Fragment eines evangelischen Briefwechsels (Vienna, 1832; new ed., 1850); *Janusk√∂pfe f√ºr Philosophie und Theologie (in collaboration with J. H. Pabst; Vienna, 1833); *Der letzte Symboliker. Eine durch die symbolischen Werke Dr. J. A. M√∂hlers und Dr. F. C. Baurs veranlasste Schrift in Briefen (Vienna, 1834); *Thomas a Scrupulis. Zur Transfiguration der Pers√∂nlichkeits-Pantheismen neuester Zeit (Vienna, 1835); *Die Juste-Milieus in der deutschen Philosophie gegenw√§rtiger Zeit (Vienna, 1838); *Eurystheus und Herakles. Metalogische Kritiken und Meditationen (Vienna, 1843). A new edition of these eight works, collected into nine volumes, appeared at Vienna in 1882 under the title of G√ºnther's Gesammelte Schriften. In addition to these, G√ºnther produced in conjunction with J. E. Veith: \\"Lydia, Philosophisches Jahrbuch\\" (5 volumes, Vienna, 1849‚Äì54). His \\"Lentigos und Peregrins Briefwechsel\\" was printed in 1857, but was issued only for private circulation. Finally, long after G√ºnther's death, Franz Peter Knoodt published from his posthumous papers \\"Anti-Savarese\\" (Vienna, 1883). Views  He was abounding in polemic against widely divergent schools of philosophy, of a style aphoristic, often quaintly humorous, and sparkling with flashes of genius, but frequently such in form and tenor as to prove little palatable to the reader, G√ºnther's writings contain only sporadic fragments of his thought. In all his scientific work, G√ºnther aimed at the intellectual confutation of the Pantheism of modern philosophy, especially in its most seductive form, the Hegelian, by originating such a system of Christian philosophy as would better serve this purpose than the Scholastic system which he rejected, and would demonstrate clearly, even from the standpoint of natural reason, the truth of positive Christianity. As against this Pantheism, he seeks a speculative basis for Christian \\"Creationism\\" in the twofold dualism of God and the world, and within the world of spirit and nature; he furthermore strives to demonstrate scientifically that the fundamental teachings of the Christian Faith, and even the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation, at least in their raison d'√™tre if not in their form, are necessary truths in the mere light of reason. He would thus change faith into knowledge. A systematic and complete development of his ideas is not given in any of his works, not even in his \\"Introduction to Speculative Theology\\", in which one would most naturally look for it. The starting-point of G√ºnther's speculation is his theory of knowledge. Man is endowed with a twofold faculty of thought, the one a logical or conceptual function, which deals with appearances, and the other ontological, ideal, self-conscious, which penetrates through appearances to being; hence it is inferred that there are in man two essentially different thinking subjects. This \\"dualism of thought\\" establishes the dualism of spirit (Geist) and nature in man, who thus exhibits their synthesis. The subject of the conceptual function is the Seele 'soul', which belongs to the nature- principle (Naturprincip). From the \\"mind\\" must be distinguished the Geist 'spirit', which differs from the former essentially as the subject of ideal thought. The first result of this ideal thought-process is self-consciousness, the knowledge which man acquires of himself as a real being. The immediate object of inner perception is the conditions or states of the Ego, which make their appearance as the expressions of the two primary functions, \\"receptivity\\" and \\"spontaneity\\", when these are called into activity by influences from without. Inasmuch as the soul refers the manifestations of these two forces to the one principle and contradistinguishes itself as a real being from whatever appears before it, it arrives at the idea of the Ego. By this speculative process, which G√ºnther calls a \\"metalogical\\" or ideal (ideell) inference, as distinct from a logical or conceptual conclusion, the idea of its own being becomes for the soul the most certain of all truths (the Cartesian cogito ergo sum). Then from the certainty of its own existence the thinking soul arrives at the knowledge of an existence outside itself, since it is confronted by phenomena which it cannot refer to itself as cause, and for which, in line with the ontological inference, it must assign a cause in some real being external to itself. Thus regarding man as a compound of two qualitatively different principles, spirit and nature, he arrives at the knowledge of the real existence of nature. The fact of self-consciousness leads him also to the knowledge of God; and G√ºnther believes that the following proof of the existence of God is the only one that is possible and conclusive: when the soul, once self-conscious, has become certain of the reality of its own existence, it immediately recognizes that existence to be afflicted with the negative characteristics of dependency and limitedness; it is therefore compelled to postulate another being as its own condition precedent or its own creator, which being it must recognize, in contradistinction to itself and its own inherent negative characteristics, as absolute and infinite. Wherefore this being cannot be the Absolute Being of Pantheism, which only arrives at a realization of itself with the development of the universe; it must be One Who dominates that universe and, differing substantially from it, is the personal Creator thereof. This is the point at which G√ºnther's speculative theology takes up the thread. Proceeding along purely philosophical lines, and prescinding entirely from historical Divine Revelation, the absolute necessity of which G√ºnther contests, it seeks to make evident the fundamental tenets of positive Christianity by the mere light of reason. Thus, to begin with, the threefold personality of God is, according to him, the consequence of that process which must be supposed to take place in God as well as in the created soul, whereby the differentiation or transition is made from indeterminateness to determinateness, with the difference that this process in God must be thought of as consummated from all eternity. God, according to this theory, first sets up for His own contemplation a complete substantial emanation (Wesensemanation) of His own Being (Thesis and Antithesis: Father and Son); a further total substantial emanation, which issues from both simultaneously, constitutes the third personal Subject (the Holy Ghost), or the Synthesis, in which the opposition of thesis and antithesis disappears and their perfect parity is made manifest. On his views concerning the Trinity, G√ºnther builds up his theory of the Creation. Inseparably united with the self-consciousness of God in the three Divine Persons is His idea of the Non-Ego, that is, the idea of the Universe. This idea, in formal analogy to the threefold Divine Being and Life, has likewise a threefold scheme of Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis. God's love for this world-idea is His motive for realizing it as His own counterpart (Contraposition), and as necessarily entailing all three of its factors, two of which (spirit and nature) are in antithesis to each other, while the third (man) exists as the synthesis of both. This world-reality, which God, by the mere act of His will, has through creation called from nothingness into being, does indeed exist as really as God Himself; its reality, however, is not drawn from the essence of God, but endures as a thing essentially different from Him, since it is indeed the realized idea of non-Divine Being and Life (Dualism of God and Universe). Thus the two antithetical factors of spirit and nature in the created world differ substantially from each other and stand in mutual opposition. The antithetical relation of spirit and nature shows itself in this, that the realm of the purely spiritual is formed of a plurality of substances, of unitary and integral real principles, each of which must ever retain its unity and its integrity; while nature, which was created a single substance, a single real principle, has in its process of differentiation lost its unity for ever, and has brought forth, and still brings forth, a multiplicity of forms or individuals. For this very reason nature, in her organic individual manifestations, each of which is only a fragment of the universal nature-substance, can only attain to thought without self- consciousness. Self-conscious thought, on the other hand, is peculiar to the spirit, since self-consciousness, the thought of the Ego, presupposes the substantial unity and integrity of a free personality. The synthesis of spirit and nature is man. From man's character as a generic being, the result of his participation in the life of nature, G√ºnther deduces the rational basis of the dogmas of the Incarnation and Redemption. And, as this explains why the guilt of the first parent extends to the entire race, so also does it show how God could with perfect consistency bring about the redemption of the race which had fallen in Adam through the God-Man's union with that race as its second Head, Whose free compliance with the Divine will lay the basis of the fund of hereditary merit which serves to cancel the inherited guilt. G√ºnther was a faithful Catholic and a devout priest. His philosophical labours were at any rate a sincere and honest endeavour to promote the triumph of positive Christianity over those systems of philosophy which were inimical to it. But it is questionable whether he pursued the right course in disregarding the fruitful labours of Scholastic theology and philosophy ‚Äì of which, like most who scorn them, he had but scanty knowledge ‚Äì and permitting his thought, particularly in his natural philosophy, and his speculative method to be unduly influenced by those very systems (of Hegel and Schelling) which he combated. The fact is that the desired result was in no wise attained. The schools of philosophy which he thought he could compel, by turning their own weapons against them, to recognize the truth of Christianity, took practically no notice of his ardent contentions, while the Church not only was unable to accept his system as the true Christian philosophy and to supplant with it the Scholastic system, but was finally obliged to reject it as unsound. Reception and ecclesiastical condemnation Among Catholic scholars G√ºnther's speculative system occasioned a far-reaching movement. Though he never held a position as professor, he gathered about him through his writings a school of enthusiastic and in some instances distinguished followers, who on the other hand were opposed by eminent philosophers and theologians. At its zenith the school was powerful enough to secure the appointment of some of its members to academic professorships in Catholic philosophy. G√ºnther himself was offered professorships at Munich, Bonn, Breslau and T√ºbingen; he refused these because he hoped for a like offer from Vienna, but his expectation was never realized. In 1833 he received from Munich an honorary degree of Doctor of Theology, and a similar degree in philosophy and theology was conferred on him by the University of Prague in 1848. His earliest friends and collaborators were: the physician, Johann Heinrich Pabst (died 1838, author of Der Mensch und seine Geschichte, Vienna, 1830; 2nd ed., 1847; Gibt es eine Philosophie des positiven Christenthums? Cologne, 1832; Adam und Christus. Zur Theorie der Ehe, Vienna, 1835; in collaboration with G√ºnther, the Janusk√∂pfe); the celebrated homilist Johann Emmanual Veith, a convert (d. 1876, co-editor of the publication Lydia) and Karl Franz von Hock (d. 1869; wrote Cartesius und seine Gegner, ein Beitrag zur Charakteristik der philosophischen Bestrebungen unserer Zeit, Vienna, 1835, and other works; later took an active part in the discussion of political and economical questions). Other prominent adherents of G√ºnther were: Johann Heinrich L√∂we (professor of philosophy at Salzburg, 1839‚Äì51; at Prague, 1851); Johann Nepomuk Ehrlich (d. 1864; from 1836 taught philosophy in Krems; in 1850 became professor of moral theology at Graz, in 1852 at Prague, where in 1856 he became professor of fundamental theology); Jakob Zukrigl (d. 1876; professor of apologetics and philosophy at T√ºbingen, 1848); Xaver Schmid (d. 1883; in 1856 he became a Protestant); Jakob Merten (d. 1872); professor of philosophy in the seminary of Trier, 1845‚Äì68); Karl Werner (d. 1888; professor at St. P√∂lten, 1847; at Vienna, 1870); Theodor Gangauf, O.S.B. (d. 1875; professor of philosophy at the college of Augsburg, 1841‚Äì75, and simultaneously, 1851‚Äì59, Abbot of the Benedictine convent of St. Stephen's at the same place); Johann Sp√∂rlein (d. 1873; from 1849 professor at the college of Bamberg); Georg Karl Mayer (d. 1868; from 1842 professor at the college of Bamberg); Peter Knoodt (d. 1889; from 1845 professor of philosophy at Bonn); Peter Joseph Elvenich (d. 1886; from 1829 professor of philosophy at Breslau, at first a Hermesian and later a disciple of G√ºnther); Johann Baptista Baltzer (d. 1871; from 1830 professor of dogmatic theology at Breslau, originally a Hermesian); Joseph Hubert Reinkens (d. 1896; from 1853 professor of church history at Breslau; from 1873 Old Catholic bishop at Bonn). Finally, in a younger generation, the most distinguished advocates of the system were pupils of Knoodt, Theodor Weber (d. 1906; professor of philosophy at Breslau, 1872‚Äì90; from 1890 vicar-general under Reinkens at Bonn, and from 1896 Old Catholic bishop in that city), whose \\"Metaphysik\\" (2 volumes, Gotha, 1888‚Äì91), containing an independent reconstruction of G√ºnther's speculation, is on the whole the most important work of the G√ºntherian School; and Ernst Melzer (d. 1899 at Bonn). Among the literary opponents of G√ºnther's philosophy the following deserve mention: Johann Hast, Wenzeslaus Mattes, P. Volkmuth, P. Ildephons Sorg, O.S.B., Johann Nepomuk Oischinger, Franz Xaver Dieringer, Franz Jakob Clemens, Friedrich Michelis, Johann Adam Hitzfelder, Joseph Kleutgen and Johannes Katschthaler. Branded heretical The Congregation of the Index in Rome began in 1852 an investigation of G√ºnther's doctrines and writings, G√ºnther being invited to appear personally or to send some of his disciples to represent him. This mission was entrusted to Baltzer and Gangauf who arrived at Rome in November, 1853. Gangauf was replaced by Knoodt, a professor of theology at Bonn, in the summer of 1854. The latter and Baltzer laboured together until the end of November in that year, when they submitted their written defence to the Congregation of the Index and returned to Germany. Yet their efforts and the favourable intervention of friends in high station failed to avert the final blow, though they served to defer it for a time. Cardinal Schwarzenberg and Cardinal von Diepenbrock and Bishop Arnoldi of Trier were friendly to G√ºnther and assisted him at Rome. Even the head of the Congregation of the Index, Cardinal d'Andrea, was well-disposed towards him. On the other hand, Cardinals Johannes von Geissel, Joseph Othmar Rauscher and Carl von Reisach urged his condemnation. By decree of 8 January 1857 the Congregation placed the works of G√ºnther on the Index librorum prohibitorum. The special grounds of this condemnation were set forth by Pius IX in the Brief addressed by him to Cardinal von Geissel, Archbishop of Cologne, on 15 June 1857, which declares that G√ºnther's teachings on the Trinity, the Person of Christ, the nature of man, the Creation and particularly his views on the relation of faith to knowledge, as well as fundamental rationalism, which is the controlling factor of his philosophy even in the handling of Christian dogmas, are not consistent with the doctrine of the Church. Before the publication of the Index decree, G√ºnther had been summoned to submit thereto, and in fact had declared his acquiescence, but for him internal submission and rejection of his errors was out of the question. He felt keenly the blow, which he looked upon as an injustice and which embittered him; but subsequently he published nothing. Some of his followers, like Merten, now turned away from G√ºntherianism, but the greater number held to it obstinately, and for many years it found academic support at Bonn (through Knoodt) and at Breslau (through Elvenich and Weber). After the First Vatican Council most of the G√ºntherians named above who were still living at the time (with the exception of Veith) joined the Old Catholic movement, in which some of them assumed leading parts. Their hopes of thus imparting new vigour to G√ºntherianism were not realized, whereas, by their separation from the Church, they brought about the final elimination of G√ºntherian influence from Catholic thought.

Belonging to the class of rejection sampling algorithms, it relies on an underlying source of uniformly-distributed random numbers, typically from a pseudo-random number generator, as well as precomputed tables. The algorithm is used to generate values from a monotone decreasing probability distribution. It can also be applied to symmetric unimodal distributions, such as the normal distribution, by choosing a value from one half of the distribution and then randomly choosing which half the value is considered to have been drawn from. It was developed by George Marsaglia and others in the 1960s. A typical value produced by the algorithm only requires the generation of one random floating-point value and one random table index, followed by one table lookup, one multiply operation and one comparison. Sometimes (2.5% of the time, in the case of a normal or exponential distribution when using typical table sizes) more computations are required. Nevertheless, the algorithm is computationally much faster than the two most commonly used methods of generating normally distributed random numbers, the Marsaglia polar method and the Box‚ÄìMuller transform, which require at least one logarithm and one square root calculation for each pair of generated values. However, since the ziggurat algorithm is more complex to implement it is best used when large quantities of random numbers are required. The term ziggurat algorithm dates from Marsaglia's paper with Wai Wan Tsang in 2000; it is so named because it is conceptually based on covering the probability distribution with rectangular segments stacked in decreasing order of size, resulting in a figure that resembles a ziggurat. The Ziggurat algorithm used to generate sample values with a normal distribution. (Only positive values are shown for simplicity.) The pink dots are initially uniform-distributed random numbers. The desired distribution function is first segmented into equal areas \\"A\\". One layer i is selected at random by the uniform source at the left. Then a random value from the top source is multiplied by the width of the chosen layer, and the result is x tested to see which region of the slice it falls into with 3 possible outcomes: 1) (left, solid black region) the sample clearly under the curve and is passed directly to output, 2) (right, vertically striped region) the sample value may lie under the curve, and must be tested further. In that case, a random y value within the chosen layer is generated and compared to f(x). If less, the point is under the curve and the value x is output. If not, (the third case), the chosen point x is rejected and the algorithm is restarted from the beginning. Theory of operation The ziggurat algorithm is a rejection sampling algorithm; it randomly generates a point in a distribution slightly larger than the desired distribution, then tests whether the generated point is inside the desired distribution. If not, it tries again. Given a random point underneath a probability density curve, its x coordinate is a random number with the desired distribution. The distribution the ziggurat algorithm chooses from is made up of n equal-area regions; n ‚àí 1 rectangles that cover the bulk of the desired distribution, on top of a non- rectangular base that includes the tail of the distribution. Given a monotone decreasing probability density function f(x), defined for all x ‚â• 0, the base of the ziggurat is defined as all points inside the distribution and below y1 = f(x1). This consists of a rectangular region from (0, 0) to (x1, y1), and the (typically infinite) tail of the distribution, where x > x1 (and y < y1). This layer (call it layer 0) has area A. On top of this, add a rectangular layer of width x1 and height A/x1, so it also has area A. The top of this layer is at height y2 = y1 \\\\+ A/x1, and intersects the density function at a point (x2, y2), where y2 = f(x2). This layer includes every point in the density function between y1 and y2, but (unlike the base layer) also includes points such as (x1, y2) which are not in the desired distribution. Further layers are then stacked on top. To use a precomputed table of size n (n = 256 is typical), one chooses x1 such that xn = 0, meaning that the top box, layer n ‚àí 1, reaches the distribution's peak at (0, f(0)) exactly. Layer i extends vertically from yi to yi+1, and can be divided into two regions horizontally: the (generally larger) portion from 0 to xi+1 which is entirely contained within the desired distribution, and the (small) portion from xi+1 to xi, which is only partially contained. Ignoring for a moment the problem of layer 0, and given uniform random variables U0 and U1 ‚àà [0,1), the ziggurat algorithm can be described as: # Choose a random layer 0 ‚â§ i < n. # Let x = U0xi. # If x < xi+1, return x. # Let y = yi \\\\+ U1(yi+1 ‚àí yi). # Compute f(x). If y < f(x), return x. # Otherwise, choose new random numbers and go back to step 1. Step 1 amounts to choosing a low-resolution y coordinate. Step 3 tests if the x coordinate is clearly within the desired density function without knowing more about the y coordinate. If it is not, step 4 chooses a high- resolution y coordinate, and step 5 does the rejection test. With closely spaced layers, the algorithm terminates at step 3 a very large fraction of the time. For the top layer n ‚àí 1, however, this test always fails, because xn = 0. Layer 0 can also be divided into a central region and an edge, but the edge is an infinite tail. To use the same algorithm to check if the point is in the central region, generate a fictitious x0 = A/y1. This will generate points with x < x1 with the correct frequency, and in the rare case that layer 0 is selected and x ‚â• x1, use a special fallback algorithm to select a point at random from the tail. Because the fallback algorithm is used less than one time in a thousand, speed is not essential. Thus, the full ziggurat algorithm for one-sided distributions is: # Choose a random layer 0 ‚â§ i < n. # Let x = U0xi # If x < xi+1, return x. # If i = 0, generate a point from the tail using the fallback algorithm. # Let y = yi \\\\+ U1(yi+1 ‚àí yi). # Compute f(x). If y < f(x), return x. # Otherwise, choose new random numbers and go back to step 1. For a two-sided distribution, of course, the result must be negated 50% of the time. This can often be done conveniently by choosing U0 ‚àà (‚àí1,1) and, in step 3, testing if |x< xi+1. Fallback algorithms for the tail Because the ziggurat algorithm only generates most outputs very rapidly, and requires a fallback algorithm whenever x > x1, it is always more complex than a more direct implementation. The fallback algorithm, of course, depends on the distribution. For an exponential distribution, the tail looks just like the body of the distribution. One way is to fall back to the most elementary algorithm E = ‚àíln(U1) and let x = x1 ‚àí ln(U1). Another is to call the ziggurat algorithm recursively and add x1 to the result. For a normal distribution, Marsaglia suggests a compact algorithm: # Let x = ‚àíln(U1)/x1. # Let y = ‚àíln(U2). # If 2y > x2, return x + x1. # Otherwise, go back to step 1. Since x1 ‚âà 3.5 for typical table sizes, the test in step 3 is almost always successful. Optimizations The algorithm can be performed efficiently with precomputed tables of xi and yi = f(xi), but there are some modifications to make it even faster: * Nothing in the ziggurat algorithm depends on the probability distribution function being normalized (integral under the curve equal to 1), removing normalizing constants can speed up the computation of f(x). * Most uniform random number generators are based on integer random number generators which return an integer in the range [0, 232 ‚àí 1]. A table of 2‚àí32xi lets you use such numbers directly for U0. * When computing two- sided distributions using a two-sided U0 as described earlier, the random integer can be interpreted as a signed number in the range [‚àí231, 231 ‚àí 1], and a scale factor of 2‚àí31 can be used. * Rather than comparing U0xi to xi+1 in step 3, it is possible to precompute xi+1/xi and compare U0 with that directly. If U0 is an integer random number generator, these limits may be premultiplied by 232 (or 231, as appropriate) so an integer comparison can be used. * With the above two changes, the table of unmodified xi values is no longer needed and may be deleted. * When generating IEEE 754 single-precision floating point values, which only have a 24-bit mantissa (including the implicit leading 1), the least-significant bits of a 32-bit integer random number are not used. These bits may be used to select the layer number. (See the references below for a detailed discussion of this.) * The first three steps may be put into an inline function, which can call an out-of-line implementation of the less frequently needed steps. Generating the tables It is possible to store the entire table precomputed, or just include the values n, y1, A, and an implementation of f ‚àí1(y) in the source code, and compute the remaining values when initializing the random number generator. As previously described, you can find xi = f ‚àí1(yi) and yi+1 = yi + A/xi. Repeat n ‚àí 1 times for the layers of the ziggurat. At the end, you should have yn = f(0). There will, of course, be some round-off error, but it is a useful sanity test to see that it is acceptably small. When actually filling in the table values, just assume that xn = 0 and yn = f(0), and accept the slight difference in layer n ‚àí 1's area as rounding error. Finding x1 and A Given an initial (guess at) x1, you need a way to compute the area t of the tail for which x > x1. For the exponential distribution, this is just e‚àíx1, while for the normal distribution, assuming you are using the unnormalized f(x) = e‚àíx2/2, this is erfc(x/). For more awkward distributions, numerical integration may be required. With this in hand, from x1, you can find y1 = f(x1), the area t in the tail, and the area of the base layer A = x1y1 + t. Then compute the series yi and xi as above. If yi > f(0) for any i < n, then the initial estimate x1 was too low, leading to too large an area A. If yn < f(0), then the initial estimate x1 was too high. Given this, use a root-finding algorithm (such as the bisection method) to find the value x1 which produces yn‚àí1 as close to f(0) as possible. Alternatively, look for the value which makes the area of the topmost layer, xn‚àí1(f(0) ‚àí yn‚àí1), as close to the desired value A as possible. This saves one evaluation of f ‚àí1(x) and is actually the condition of greatest interest.

The film stars Susan Strasberg, Ronald Lewis, Ann Todd, and Christopher Lee in a supporting role. It was released in the United States as Scream of Fear. Plot After the suicide of her best friend, wheelchair-bound heiress Penny Appleby (Susan Strasberg) arrives at her estranged father's estate on the French Riviera. Her stepmother (Ann Todd), whom Penny has only just met, informs her that the father has been called away on business. She cannot say when he will return or why he left when he was expecting Penny's arrival. Although the stepmother has made the place comfortable for Penny, the young woman does not trust her. That night she believes she sees her father's corpse in the guest cottage. When others respond to her hysterical screams, the corpse is not there. The stepmother tries to convince Penny that her recent tragedy is causing her to hallucinate, and the family doctor (Christopher Lee) cites Penny's history of neurotic behaviour to support that view. The family chauffeur (Ronald Lewis) meets Penny privately to say he believes Penny did see something unusual, even if not a corpse. He offers to help her investigate. As they proceed, Penny begins to wonder if he is really an ally or if he is leading her away from the truth. When a police detective begins his own investigation, he suspects that Penny may have secrets of her own. Cast * Susan Strasberg as Penny Appleby * Ronald Lewis as Robert * Ann Todd as Jane Appleby * Christopher Lee as Doctor Gerrard * John Serret as Inspector Legrand * Leonard Sachs as Spratt * Anne Blake as Marie * Fred Johnson as Father Production Jimmy Sangster stated that he originally wrote the film for Sidney Box who assigned him to produce it. According to Sangster, Box became ill and stopped his work temporarily, leading his work to be taken over by his brother-in-law Peter Rogers, who was busy working on the Carry On series. Sangster then bought the film back from Rogers and sold it to Michael Carreras on the condition that Sangster would be allowed to produce. Release Taste of Fear was distributed in the United Kingdom on June 5, 1961 with an 82 minute running time. It was later distributed in the United States with an 81 minute running time on August 22, 1961 under the title Scream of Fear. The film was a success in the United Kingdom and the United States and was very popular in Europe, being one of Hammer's most profitable productions which led to a cycle of similar films. In March 2013, it was announced that the film will be remade for Sony, and directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, whose previous credits include the acclaimed 2007 Spanish horror film, The Orphanage. Legacy Christopher Lee later stated that the film \\"was the best film that I was in that Hammer ever made... [...] It had the best director, the best cast and the best story.\\" Ann Todd contradicted him, saying that she thought \\"it was a terrible film.

School crest  School crest The school crest is a black shield with red edging bearing the school's initials (\\"BHS\\") stylised across the central face of the shield, written in red, with a white line that follows the top contour above the initials, and a red maple leaf below the initials, bearing the Latin motto Pari Passu in white in a scroll- like space, in the base of the shield, and included within the unbroken red edging that marks the perimeter of the crest. The shield appears to get larger about halfway down, and the expansion is occupied by large, tapering red lines that occupy the expanded space.  School mascot  The school mascot is The Phantom. Varsity sports teams are called the \\"Phantoms\\" or the \\"BHS Phantoms\\", and the typical image of the mascot is of a hooded person or ghost, usually faceless, bearing resemblance to the iconic \\"Grim Reaper\\" image, carrying a scythe. The origins of this mascot are not related to the \\"Grim Reaper\\", but rather the legend of the \\"Phantom Ship of the Bay of Chaleur\\", a longstanding legend in the Bathurst area that a ghost ship, or phantom ship, has been seen on fire floating in the local harbour throughout the city's history.  School motto  The official school motto is the Latin phrase Pari Passu. Curiously, although this is not the \\"official\\" motto of the school, it is the most prominent and recognized motto by students and alumni and appears on the school crest. The origins and raison d'√™tre of the motto appear to be lost, but it is probable that the context refers to the equality of all graduates, each with an equal share to the claim of a graduate of the school. \\"On equal footing\\" is the translation of the school crest.  Bathurst van collision  Bathurst High School made headlines across Canada on January 12, 2008, following a motor vehicle crash that killed seven students from the school's basketball team, as well as the wife of their coach. The 1997 Ford Econoline E350 Club Wagon in which they were traveling in spun across the center line and struck a tractor trailer in freezing rain conditions. Four in the van survived, including the team's coach, who was driving the van, and his daughter. The vehicle was determined to have been in poor condition, with worn all-season tires, and a partially rusted frame.

The school building was originally built with money and on land donated by Grace Arents. Structure Open High School has a community-based structure where advisory groups known as 'families' direct students in the development of school activities and functions, and other school related activities. Each 'family' selects two students, \\"reps,\\" to represent them in a Student Representative Council. At meetings of this council, student reps bring forth questions, disagreements, or ideas that a 'family' may have and would like to discuss with the whole student body. If a concern gets enough attention, it is brought to the 'town meeting' where the entire administrative staff and student body together discuss and vote on anything that a single student or group of students may deem important. Open High School doesn't contain as many students as other high schools throughout Richmond. Students can create elective classes with teacher 'sponsors.'

He studied theology at Gordon College in Massachusetts, and was ordained in 1933 in the Northern Baptist Convention. He pastored churches in New Hampshire and Vermont while pursuing further education at Gordon Divinity School. Ladd served as an instructor at Gordon College of Theology and Missions (now Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary), Wenham, Massachusetts from 1942‚Äì45. He was an associate professor of New Testament and Greek from 1946‚Äì50, and head of the department of New Testament from 1946‚Äì49. He studied at Harvard University during this period, completing a PhD dissertation on \\"The Eschatology of the Didache\\". Ladd moved to California in 1950, and taught biblical theology at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena. Fuller was in the fourth year of its existence when Ladd joined the faculty, and Hagner notes that he \\"became one of the key figures in developing the seminary's direction.\\" Notability Ladd's best-known work, A Theology of the New Testament, has been used by thousands of seminary students since its publication in 1974. In a poll conducted by Mark Noll in 1986, this work ranked as the second most influential book among evangelical scholars, second only to Calvin's Institutes. A Theology of the New Testament was enhanced and updated by Donald A. Hagner in 1993. Ladd's belief in both present and future aspects of the Kingdom of God caused his detractors to critically compare his eschatological views to the Amillennialism that was popular within Reformed theological circles.D'Elia, John A.. A Place at the Table: George Eldon Ladd and the Rehabilitation of Evangelical Scholarship in America. Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 49. Despite these comparisons, Ladd was not Reformed, and in fact rejected the Calvinistic view of the doctrine of salvation.D'Elia, John A.. A Place at the Table: George Eldon Ladd and the Rehabilitation of Evangelical Scholarship in America. Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 10. John Piper uses Ladd's desire for scholarly credibility as a cautionary tale, and relates how Ladd \\"was almost undone emotionally and professionally\\" by Norman Perrin's critical review of Ladd's Jesus and the Kingdom. Piper goes on to describe how Ladd walked through the halls of Fuller shouting and waving a royalty check when A Theology of the New Testament was a stunning success ten years later. Ladd was a notable, modern proponent of Historic Premillennialism, and often criticized dispensationalist views. This was notable during this period, as dispensationalism was by far the most widely held view among evangelicals during the mid-twentieth century.D'Elia, John A.. A Place at the Table: George Eldon Ladd and the Rehabilitation of Evangelical Scholarship in America. Oxford University Press, 2008, p. xxiii. His writings regarding the Kingdom of God (especially his view of inaugurated eschatology) have become a cornerstone of Kingdom theology. His perspective is expressed in The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views, R. G. Clouse, editor (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1977) and the shorter and more accessible The Gospel of the Kingdom (Paternoster, 1959). In 1978, a Festschrift was published in his honour.

He held the Chair in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science at the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, and before that a chair with the same title at the University of Sussex. Since retiring he is Honorary Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science at Birmingham. He has published widely on philosophy of mathematics, epistemology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence; he also collaborated widely, e.g. with biologist Jackie Chappell on the evolution of intelligence. Early life and education Sloman was born in 1936, in the town of Que Que (now called Kwe Kwe), in what was then Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). His parents were Lithuanian Jews who emigrated to Southern Rhodesia around the turn of the century, Sloman describes himself as an atheist. He went to school in Cape Town between 1948 and 1953, then earned a degree in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Cape Town in 1956, after which a Rhodes Scholarship (from South African College School) took him to the University of Oxford (first Balliol College, and then St Antony's College). In Oxford, he became interested in philosophy after a brief period studying mathematical logic supervised by Hao Wang, eventually writing a DPhil in philosophy, defending the ideas of Immanuel Kant about the nature of mathematical knowledge as non-empirical and non-analytic ('Knowing and Understanding', 1962, now online at http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/sloman-1962/). Career His first job was teaching philosophy at the University of Hull (1962‚Äì64), after which he moved to Sussex University where he worked on philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, meta-ethics, and various topics in epistemology. In 1969, he learned about artificial intelligence (AI) from Max Clowes, then a leading UK AI researcher in vision. As a result of this, he published a paper distinguishing analogical representations' from Fregean representations and criticising the logicist approach to AI as too narrow. It was presented at IJCAI in 1971, then reprinted in Artificial Intelligence. Subsequently, he was invited by Bernard Meltzer to spend a year (1972‚Äì1973) in Edinburgh University where he met and worked with many leading AI researchers. When he went back to Sussex he helped to found what eventually grew into COGS, the School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences. He managed the Poplog development team between 1980 and 1991. While at Sussex University he published \\"The Computer Revolution in Philosophy: Philosophy science and models of mind\\" (which emphasised the importance of architectures) in 1978, and other papers on various aspects of philosophy and AI, including work on the analysis of 'ought' and 'better', on vision on emotions in robots, on forms of representation and other topics. Much of his energy was devoted to developing new kinds of teaching materials based on POP-11 and Poplog for students learning AI and cognitive science. In 1991, after 27 years at Sussex, he was offered a research chair in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, where he started a cognition and affect project (later on the Free Open Source Poplog Portal) and is still on it. He retired in 2001, but continues working full-time. Influences His philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by the writings of Immanuel Kant, Gottlob Frege and Karl Popper, and to a lesser extent by John Austin, Gilbert Ryle, R. M. Hare (who, as his 'personal tutor' at Balliol College discussed meta-ethics with him), Imre Lakatos and Ludwig Wittgenstein. What he could learn from philosophers left large gaps, which he decided around 1970 research in artificial intelligence might fill. E.g. philosophy of mind could be transformed by testing ideas in working fragments of minds, and philosophy of mathematics could be illuminated by trying to understand how a working robot could develop into a mathematician. Much of his thinking about AI was influenced by Marvin Minsky and despite his critique of logicism he also learnt much from John McCarthy. His work on emotions can be seen as an elaboration of a paper on \\"Motivational and emotional controls of cognition\\", written in the 1960s by Herbert A. Simon. He disagrees with all of these on some topics, while agreeing on others. Recognition He is a Fellow of Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour and European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence. In 2018, he became a Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute. Sussex University awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Science in July 2006.

It is found in sub-Saharan Africa in South Sudan, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Ugandan kob is normally reddish-brown, differentiating it from other kob subspecies. A Ugandan kob appears on the coat of arms of Uganda, along with a grey crowned crane (Balearica regulorum gibbericeps), representing the abundant wildlife present in the country. Description The Ugandan kob is similar in appearance to the impala but it is more sturdily built. Only the males have horns, which are lyre-shaped, strongly ridged and divergent. Males are slightly larger than females, being at the shoulder, with an average weight of , while females are at the shoulder and on average weigh about . Apart from the throat patch, muzzle, eye ring and inner ear, which are white, the coat is golden to reddish-brown, the colour differentiating it from other kob subspecies. The belly and inside of the legs are white, and the front of the forelegs are black. Distribution and habitat This subspecies is native to East Africa. It occurs in South Sudan, to the west of the Nile, Uganda and the north-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Its range used to extend into northwestern Tanzania, where it grazed the grasslands margining Lake Victoria, and into southwestern Kenya, but it has been extirpated from these countries. It is typically found in open or wooded savanna, within a reasonable distance of water, and it also occurs in grasslands near rivers and lakes. Its habit of lying out in open grassland make it an accessible target for poachers, and 98% of the present population are found in national parks and other protected areas. Ecology Ugandan kobs are herbivores and feed largely on grasses and reeds. The females and young males form loose groups of varying size which range according to food availability, often moving along watercourses and grazing in valley bottoms. One group in South Sudan was recorded as travelling during the dry season. Sometimes non-breeding males form their own groups. Females become sexually mature in their second year, but males do not start breeding until they are older. Larger populations of kob tend to have a lek mating system, the females living in loose groups and only visiting the traditional breeding grounds in order to mate. For this purpose, males hold small territories of up to in diameter, the smallest territories being in the centre of crowded leks. Calving takes place at the end of the rainy season; a single calf is born in November or December, after a gestation period of about nine months.

Biography Maquet was born in Paris in 1813. He studied at the Lyc√©e Charlemagne where he became a professor at the age of 18. Trained as a historian, he turned to literature, and became close with such literary figures as Th√©ophile Gautier and G√©rard de Nerval. Through Nerval, he became acquainted with the already famous Dumas in 1838. G√©rard de Nerval introduced Maquet to Dumas and asked the famous author to rewrite a play of Maquet's and publish it under his own name. Dumas was then given a manuscript by Maquet which Dumas went on to publish under his own name as Le Chevalier d'Harmental. The two started writing historical romances together, with Maquet outlining the plot and characters in draft form and Dumas adding colorful dialogue and details. At the insistence of the publisher, Maquet's name was left off the title page, and in return he received generous fees. The collaboration with Dumas ended in 1851. (Maquet had earlier sued Dumas demanding co-authorship and royalties, but the court found in favor of Dumas, on the grounds that \\"Dumas without Maquet would have been Dumas: what would Maquet have been without Dumas?\\") Maquet went on to produce a large solo body of work in terms of historical romances, plays and an opera. In 1861, he became an officer of the L√©gion d'honneur. Maquet died comfortably well-off. He is buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His brothers Charles and Hector Maquet were the founders of the luxury stationery manufacturer Maison Maquet. Works With Dumas Maquet collaborated with Dumas on eighteen novels, and many plays.

The Preliminary Discourse was written by Jean Le Rond d'Alembert to describe the structure of the articles included in the Encyclop√©die and their philosophy, as well as to give the reader a strong background in the history behind the works of the learned men who contributed to what became the most profound circulation of the knowledge of the time. Background The Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot is arguably one of the best introductions to the French Enlightenment, giving forth the idea that man possesses the capability, through his own intelligence and analysis, to alter the conditions of human life. The Encyclopedia constituted a demand of the intellectual community for a refinement of all of the branches of knowledge in reference to past and recent discoveries. Such a compilation of human knowledge would be both secular and naturalistic, discrediting theology as the primary basis. The Discourse, although created by d'Alembert, was actually a result of collaboration with other \\"men of letters\\" aiming towards the same progressive goals of the Enlightenment. Three of these major contemporary philosophes that undoubtedly contributed to the guiding philosophies and beliefs of the \\"Discourse\\" include Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and √âtienne Bonnot de Condillac, with whom d'Alembert was known to have been in contact. These men shared a passion for the dissemination of scientific knowledge. And, although this time period would seem unfavorable to such an endeavor, with Europe undergoing massive political upheaval and general instability, the time was ripe for their ideals to take hold. A thriving community of professionals, aristocrats, and clergy became increasingly responsive to the exchange of ideas that came to characterize and serve as the foundation for the cooperative compilation of information in this Encyclopedia. Before the Discourse was ever created, d'Alembert was actually better known for his scientific and mathematical genius. However, over time, and in part due to his vibrant personality, he befriended Madame du Deffand, whose powerful salon ultimately allowed him to enter the public eye as a philosophe. d'Alembert also became a close ally of Diderot, and eventually, d'Alembert was a man who was held in very high regard among Europe's intellectuals. Ultimately, d'Alembert's tendency to turn more to history to explain the foundations of science and ethics reflects a general historical trend to seek enlightenment and better understanding of human nature in history. Ultimately, the Discourse defines two ways of approaching ideas, one of which being operations of the \\"isolated mind\\" (xli) and the other concerning studies of the origins of truth as a function of the progress of a given society. Although the Discourse derives much of its fundamental principles from men such as Ren√© Descartes, John Locke and Condillac in a purely metaphysical sense, the effect of historical experience is vital. It is important to note that while the philosophes began the intellectual transformations that became known as the French Enlightenment, scientists all over Europe began to make their own changes in terms of new discoveries, areas they felt required further study, and how they could go about such studies, i.e. their methodology. Many of these new scientists felt that they were rebelling against old forms of science and scientific knowledge, just as the philosophes felt that they were bringing to the world a new way of thinking about humanity and human knowledge. The philosophes were aware of these changes in the field of science, and as such, they fully supported, and arguably adapted, the scientists' new systems of thinking into their philosophical ideas. One can see this in the Discourse itself; d'Alembert attempted to create a method of systematizing and organizing all legitimate information and knowledge as well as make easier and more efficient the unearthing of more knowledge. D'Alembert's motives behind such an enterprise can ultimately be referenced to one of the ideas that he puts forth in the Discourse, for \\"liberty of action and thought alone is capable of producing great things, and liberty requires only enlightenment to preserve it from excess\\" (62). Clerical control in the domain of knowledge and intellect was considered detrimental to the progress of human knowledge. Maintaining that the Discourse was ultimately corrosive to hierarchical authority and privilege paved the way for the evolution of egalitarian principles in Western culture. D'Alembert puts forth that all men are equal in their sensations, which is the source of their mind. The ultimate distinction of man is primarily intellectual, which overthrows any preconceived connection between social privilege and knowledge. Therefore, the Encyclopedia as a whole speaks to the general public. Summary Part I In part one of the book, d'Alembert provides a general introduction to the origin of knowledge, which led to the works found in the Encyclop√©die. He asserts that the \\"existence of our senses\\" is \\"indisputable,\\" and that these senses are thus the principle of all knowledge. He links this idea to a chain of thinking and reflection that eventually leads to the need to communicate, which sets another chain of events in effect. One of his arguments for the origin of communication is that it was necessary for people to protect themselves from the evils of the world and to benefit from each other's knowledge. This communication led to the exchange of ideas that enhanced the ability of individuals to further human knowledge. Additionally, d'Alembert introduces the reader to the types of knowledge people store. The two main types that he describes refer to direct and reflexive knowledge. Direct knowledge is obtained by human senses and reflexive knowledge is derived from direct knowledge. These two types of knowledge lead to the three main types of thinking and their corresponding divisions of human knowledge: memory, which corresponds with History; reflection or reason, which is the basis of Philosophy; and what d'Alembert refers to as \\"imagination,\\" (50) or imitation of Nature, which produces Fine Arts. From these divisions spring smaller subdivisions such as physics, poetry, music and many others. d'Alembert was also greatly influenced by the Cartesian principle of simplicity. In this first part of the book, he describes how the reduction of the principles of a certain science gives them scope and makes them more \\"fertile\\" (22). Only by reducing principles can they be understood and related to each other. Ultimately, from a high \\"vantage point\\" (47) the philosopher can then view the vast labyrinth of sciences and the arts. d'Alembert then goes on to describe the tree of knowledge and the separation and simultaneous connections between memory, reason, and imagination. He later explains that the ideal universe would be one gigantic truth if one only knew how to view it as such; the assumption that knowledge has intrinsic unity can be seen as the foundation of the project of making the encyclopedia. Part II Part two of the book provides the reader with an account of the progress of human knowledge in the sequence of memory, imagination and reason. This sequence is different from the one described in Part I, where the sequence is memory, reason, and imagination. It is the sequence a mind left in isolation or the original generation follows whereas in Part II he describes the progress of human knowledge in the centuries of enlightenment that started from erudition, continued with belles-lettres, and reached to philosophy. Instead of writing in terms of general ideas, d'Alembert provides the dates, places and people responsible for the progress of literary works since the Renaissance leading up to his date. One key example is Ren√© Descartes, who the author lauds as both an excellent philosopher and mathematician. His application of algebra to geometry, also known as the Cartesian coordinate system, provided an excellent tool for the physical sciences. He focuses on the importance of ancient knowledge and the ability to understand and build on it. Reference is made that concepts of knowledge could not have advanced as quickly had there not been ancient works to imitate and surpass. He also clarifies that there can be disadvantages to the ability to retrieve information from the past. Noted in the text is the lack of improvement in philosophy in comparison to other advancements due to the ignorant belief that ancient philosophy could not be questioned. d'Alembert claims that it would be ignorant to perceive that everything could be known about a particular subject. Additionally, he makes an attempt to show how individuals could free their minds from the yoke of authority. His use of deductive logic provides a more philosophical base for the existence of God. He makes clear that all sciences are restricted as much as can be to facts and that opinion influences science as little as possible. d'Alembert states that philosophy is far more effective at the analysis of our perceptions when the \\"soul is in a state of tranquility\\", when it is not caught up in passion and emotion (96). He believes that the philosopher is key in furthering the fields of science. The philosopher must be able to stand back and observe science and nature with an impartial eye. Furthermore, the importance of science and the advancements of such intellects as Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Descartes, John Locke and others are explained. Part III Part three of the book concludes by detailing the important attributes of the writing of the Encyclop√©die and by mentioning important contributors. d'Alembert discusses how the Encyclop√©die is open to changes and additions from others since it is a work of many centuries. In addition, he states that an omission in an encyclopedia is harmful to its substance which differs from an omission in a dictionary. d'Alembert also states the three categories of the Encyclop√©die, which are the sciences, the liberal arts and the mechanical arts. He states that it is important that these subcategories remain separate and concludes with the fact that society must judge the Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot. System of Human Knowledge At the end of the book, d'Alembert includes a detailed explanation of the system of human knowledge. This includes a chart entitled \\"Figurative System of Human Knowledge\\", which divides human understanding into its three constituents: memory, reason, and imagination. The chart then subdivides each of the three major categories into many other categories of human understanding. After his chart d'Alembert goes on to provide a detailed explanation of every division and subdivision apparent in his chart. The chart establishes a complex genealogy of knowledge and the way man has subdivided knowledge into the specific areas he feels they are applicable. It is important to remember that no one of these systems of human knowledge plays a more significant role than any of the others. These systems are designed around the idea that each uses the other two to build upon itself and further human knowledge as a whole. In context the chart shows a progression of knowledge through the ages, memory being the past, reason being the present, which examines and tries to either build or create new theories based on memory, and imagination which focuses on making new assumptions or theories about things in our human universe. Significance The method of the Discourse and the Encyclopedia marked a shift from Descartes‚Äô rationalism toward the empiricism of John Locke and Isaac Newton. In the Discourse, d‚ÄôAlembert rejects a priori, indemonstrable speculations that lead to error and ‚Äúintellectual despotism‚Äù and assumes a method based on hard facts and evidence (xxxv). A main objective of the ‚ÄúEncyclopedia‚Äù was not only to organize a collection of known information, but also to establish a cohesive method of gathering facts and principles yet to be discovered. D‚ÄôAlembert acknowledges that ‚Äúit is no less difficult to encompass the infinitely varied branches of human knowledge in a truly unified system,‚Äù (5), yet despite this seemingly formidable task, D‚ÄôAlembert succeeds in fulfilling the purpose of the Encyclopedia, which was to gather all the facets of knowledge into one unified text, and to compile knowledge in a way that it could be standardized and compartmentalized into different categories. With this method, d‚ÄôAlembert believed the philosophes could create a system of knowledge that would be unified and systematized, but not so rigid and strict as to impose limits on the search for new facts. A classic example of this systematized approach is the aforementioned figurative system of human knowledge, which quantifies knowledge by dividing it into three categories: memory, reason, and imagination. The purpose of this was to place knowledge within general framework that could be added to or expounded upon if necessary. As Richard Schwab, who translated the text, states in the introduction, d‚ÄôAlembert believed the ‚ÄúDiscourse of method‚Äù would give mankind the power to independently shape and direct its own destiny. This method provided an answer to the growing demand of the intellectual community of Europe to create a synthesis of information based upon secular and naturalistic principles rather than upon a theological teleology (xxxi), and to disseminate knowledge throughout the entire population, no longer being restricted to the wealthy, academic elite. Quotes * \\"In vain did some philosophers assert, while suppressing their groans in the midst of sufferings, that pain was not an evil at all. In vain did others place supreme happiness in sensuality-of which they nevertheless deprived themselves through fear of its consequences. All of them would have known our nature better if they had been content to limit their definition of the sovereign good of the present life to the exemption from pain, and to agree that, without hoping to arrive at this sovereign good, we are allowed only to approach it more or less, in proportion to our vigilance and the precautions we take.\\" See also *Figurative system of human knowledge, d'Alembert. *Encyclop√©die, Diderot. *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, John Locke. *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, David Hume. *What is Enlightenment?, Immanuel Kant. *Critique of Pure Reason, Immanuel Kant. *Dictionnaire Philosophique, Voltaire.

It is located at the northeastern entrance of the city, on the way to Marvdasht and Isfahan, between Baba Kouhi and Chehel Maqam Mountains near Allahu Akbar gorge.Shiraz Municipality History The Gate was first built during the reign of 'Adud ad-Dawla. By the time of the Zand dynasty, it had sustained a lot of damage, so it was restored and a small room on top was added, in which were kept hand-written Qur‚ÄôƒÅns by Sultan Ibrahim Bin Shahrukh Gurekani. The two Qur‚ÄôƒÅns are known as Hifdah-Man. Travelers passing underneath the gates were believed to receive the blessing of the Holy Book as they began their trip or journey from Shiraz. During the Qajar dynasty, the gate was damaged by multiple earthquakes; it was later restored by Mohammad Zaki Khan Nouri. In 1937 the two Qur‚ÄôƒÅns were taken from the gate and were taken to the Pars Museum in Shiraz, where they remain today. In 1949 the arch of the gate was restored by Hosein Igar, a merchant also known as E'temad Al-Tojar. Today the gates are part of a city park where Shirazis relax and picnic during their leisure hours.

AJP Motos was founded in 1987 by brothers Ant√≥nio Pinto and Jorge Pinto' in Penafiel, northern Portugal. Beginning as a workshop preparing off-road motorcycles, the company later diversified into manufacturing complete bikes.  History  2010 AJP PR3 200cc MX 2010 AJP PR4 200cc Enduro 2010 AJP PR5 250cc In 1981, at age 22, Antonio Pinto opened a motorcycle repair and modifications workshop. In 1987, AJP was founded and produced its first model, the \\"Ariana\\" 125cc, with a 2 stroke Casal engine. The brand name \\"AJP\\" is derived from the initials of seven-times Portuguese Enduro Champion Ant√≥nio J Pinto. This motorcycle had a limited production run of only 25 units, but it incorporated some technical solutions that were used and developed in subsequent models. In 1991, AJP joined in partnership with Petrogal (now Galp Energia), which led to the development of the AJP Galp 50 and to a range of synthetic oils for 2 stroke engines. From 1991 to 2000, AJP participated in the National Championships of Enduro, winning five titles in a row from 1996 to 2000. AJP also participated in the National Off-Road Championships, with victories in 1996, 1997 and 1999. In 2001 AJP marketed a new motorcycle, the AJP PR4 125 with a 4-stroke engine. An innovation was the fuel-tank's position beneath the rider's seat, a feature used also in current models. This design alters the position of the motorcycle's CG, enhancing its handling. The AJP PR4 125cc marked the beginning of AJP's export activity, the first units being sent to EU countries, including France, Germany and England. In 2003, AJP relocated to a new facility in Lousada. In 2004 AJP introduced a new version of PR4 with a 200cc 4-stroke engine. This 200 model shares the same cycle parts as the 125; and with this model, AJP extended its exports into Spain, Poland, Italy and Greece. In 2007, the AJP launched the PR3 200 MX, with a lightweight frame comprising steel tubing and twin aluminum spars. This frame permits simpler assembly at the factory. This was followed by a PRO version, with enhanced suspension components. In 2008, AJP introduced a homologated PR3 mode weighing 99 kg with a 12.3 bhp 125cc engine, followed by 19 bhp 200cc models in 2009.AJP brochure by Armitt Leisure Supplies Also in 2009, AICEP Capital Global became a partner of the project, to aid AJP's expansion plans. In 2009 AJP released the PR5, a homologated fuel-injected 4-valve 24.7 bhp 250 cc model weighing 115 kg.AJP brochure by Armitt Leisure Supplies The 2016 model now features liquid cooling. In 2009 AJP released the PR7, a single-cylinder 650cc \\"Adventure\\" bike. A Motorcycle News review declared: \\"Tipping the scales at 165kg fully fuelled and ready to ride, it‚Äôs close to 100kg lighter than the current glut of big capacity adventure bikes on the market, making the PR7 a truly capable bike off-road ‚Äì and one you can pick up easily on your own should things go awry.\\"MCN PR7review The AJP \\"PR\\" model range The PR3, PR4 & PR5 have 4-stroke single-cylinder engines closely based on the Honda XR series engines; and the AJP PR series bikes may be seen as updated equivalents of Honda's XR200 & XR250 of the 1980s.

The magazine was intended to eventually make up a multi-volume encyclopedia dedicated to aviation. First issued in 1981, the partwork comprised 216 parts, each of 20 pages (plus the covers), making up 18 volumes (4280 pages). The first two issues were sold together for the price of one, subsequent issues were sold on their own. Empty binders for each volume (of 12 issues) were also sold. These binders were dark blue in colour and contained the imprint of a Panavia Tornado on the front. They held the issues using a metal strip that was threaded through the staples of each issue to hold them in place. Each issue consisted of four separate sections. The final two parts (215 and 216), issued in 1985, comprised the index for the encyclopedia. A table of contents was also included with these final issues that was intended to be put into the start of volume 1. History of Aviation The first few pages of each issue (usually 4 or 5) were dedicated to the history of aviation which also covered commercial aviation and current (as in early 1980s) air power (\\"Air Power Today\\"). The \\"History of Aviation\\" began in issue 1 with a 7 part series on the Vietnam War. Most of the \\"History of Aviation\\" was taken up with warfare especially World War II starting with the Blitzkrieg in issue 8 and ending with defeat of Japan in issue 156. The coverage of World War 2 also included surveys of different combat roles and aircraft types. World War I was also covered as was the Korean War, Spanish Civil War, post-World War II colonial conflicts and the Arab-Israeli Wars. In later issues the Cold War was covered in depth. \\"Air Power Today\\" covered the then current (1980s) military situation with surveys of different types of military aircraft and combat roles and regional surveys of airpower around the world. The history of \\"Commercial Aviation\\" was also covered in a multi-part series starting with the earliest commercial air flights and ending with general aviation and microlights near the very end of the Encyclopedia's run. The World's Greatest Aircraft The second section of the issue was \\"The World's Greatest Aircraft\\" and was an in depth look at a major aircraft type, including a cutaway drawing, a list of variants and a three-way view in colour on the centre pages. The North American Mustang was featured in issue one, with the North American XB-70 the final aircraft featured in issue 214. A-Z of Aircraft The third section was the \\"A-Z of Aircraft\\" which started off in great depth though in later issues stopped featuring more obscure types and collected minor aircraft manufacturer's aircraft into one entry. This can be illustrated by the first and last entries in the A-Z. The first aircraft featured was the AAMSA A9B-M Quail (on page 14) but the last (on page 3120) was a collected entry on Zmaj aircraft. However based on the Zmaj entry then the last aircraft in the A-Z was the Zmaj Nebojsa. When the A-Z was completed this section was replaced by the \\"Chronology of Aviation\\" from 1903 to 1984 and finally a history of RAF squadrons. Back pages The final section (though it was part of the cover which was to be removed when the issue was placed in a binder) was a feature on an air force or airline. The back cover either featured an advert for the binders or a full page photo of an aircraft. Sometimes the airforce/airline feature was omitted in favour of an order form for binders or back issues or even sometimes an advert.

His more notable hymns include: \\"Alleluia! Alleluia! Let the Holy Anthem Rise\\"; \\"Come, Holy Ghost\\"; and \\"Ye Sons and Daughters of the Lord\\". Life Caswall c.1860 He was born at Yateley, Hampshire on 15 July 1814, the son of Rev. R. C. Caswall, sometime Vicar of Yateley, Hampshire. Caswall was educated at Chigwell Grammar School, Marlborough Grammar School and Brasenose College, Oxford, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1836 with honours and later proceeded to Master of Arts. In 1838 he was ordained deacon, and in 1839 priest, in the Church of England. Before leaving Oxford, he published, under the pseudonym of Scriblerus Redivivus, The Art of Pluck, a satire on the ways of the careless college student.\\"Edward Caswall 1814-1878\\", The Hymns and Carols of Christmas He was curate of the Church of St Lawrence at Stratford- sub-Castle, near Salisbury from 1840 to 1847. As curate, he would invite the children who had attended morning services to the parsonage and give them breakfast. On the anniversary on one's baptism, he would give some money to buy clothes.De Flon, Nancy Marie. Edward Caswall: Newman's Brother and Friend, Gracewing Publishing, 2005, In the summer of 1846 he, his wife, and his brother Tom visited Ireland. He resigned his curacy and, in January 1847, was received into the Roman Catholic Church by Cardinal Acton at Rome. His brother Tom had converted to Catholicism previously. Caswall's conversion caused an estrangement from some members of his family, including his mother and brother Alfred. His wife, Louisa Stuart Caswall, who had also become a Catholic, died of cholera on 14 September 1849 while they were staying at Torquay. The following year Caswall joined the Oratory of St. Philip Neri under future Cardinal Newman, to whose influence his conversion to Roman Catholicism was due. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1852. Caswall was delegated the responsibility of establishing the Oratory school, which opened in 1859. He often served as Acting Superior in Newman's absence. He died at the Oratory, Edgbaston, near Birmingham on 2 January 1878 and was buried at Rednal, near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire.

Caswall is best known for his translations from the Roman Breviary and other Latin sources, which are marked by faithfulness to the original. Most of the translations were done at the Oratory of St. Philip Neri at Edgbaston. They were published in Lyra Catholica, containing all the breviary and missal hymns (London, 1849); The Masque of Mary (1858); and A May Pageant and other poems (1865).

The premise of the novel relies on a future set in a future dystopian world in which everyone is turned \\"Pretty\\" by extreme cosmetic surgery upon reaching age 16. It tells the story of teenager Tally Youngblood who rebels against society's enforced conformity in hopes of exposing the societies dangerous obsessions with perfection and uniformity. Plot The book begins with Tally, the main protagonist, as a Pretty debating what to wear to a bash. While attending the bash at which she is to be voted into the \\"Crims\\" clique, she is followed by someone who appears to be a \\"Special\\", a member of Special Circumstances. She soon finds him and discovers it‚Äôs Croy, a Smokey she knew before she turned pretty. He then told her that he left a note for Tally somewhere in Valentino Mansion.Then he went back to The Smoke and Tally tried to follow him by pushing Peris off the balcony where the bungee bounced, and kneed her head hard enough to make her bleed and was voted into the Crims by the bubbly movement. Tally returns to her care-free life as a Pretty. Her peace is disrupted when Zane, who is the leader of the Crims, asks her about David, whom she loved while she lived in the Smoke. Zane and Tally kiss and fall in love. Zane had once known Croy and had been determined to escape to the Smoke before his surgery. He regrets that he didn't go into the wilderness then. Zane is eager to accompany Tally to find the object Croy has hidden for her. They face strenuous, dangerous physical challenges in order to locate the item, which is accompanied by a letter from Tally to herself, written before she went under the knife. The letter explained to her future self why she had become a Pretty ‚Äì to take two pills that will cure her from the foggy-headed life of a Pretty. Tally was afraid to take the pills alone so she and Zane split it right before Special Circumstances came and gave them cuffs like interface rings, but they can't come off. After taking the pills Zane starts getting bad headaches, but he seems to be more cured than Tally. Then one day the Crims pull a bubbly trick by using alcohol to melt a hovering ice rink and crash a soccer game, causing the clique to become famous. Later that night at the bonfire, Shay and Tally get into a huge fight causing Shay to turn on Tally. After that Dr. Cable offers Tally a job as a Special, which she immediately turns down. When Tally and Zane go to Uglyville they find Sussy and Dex, two uglies who helped Tally and David back when she was a Smokey. Tally takes Zane to the hospital but soon finds out that Shay has started a clique with Crim rejects called Cutters, where they cut themselves to cure the lesions. Zane and Tally soon get to decide to escape the city with a few other Crims. Fausto helps Zane and Tally get the cuff off, and they soon escape the city by hoverboarding out of a hot-air balloon. Tally's hoverboard broke so she had to walk on foot to find Zane. Peris, Tally's friend from her Ugly days, decides in the balloon that he does not want to go to the New Smoke. He stalls for Tally, and she falls into a reservation with rather primitive people who seem to be very violent. She is considered a god there because of her beauty. There she meets Andrew Simpson Smith, the village holy man, who is the only one who speaks her language, which they call the language of the gods, with significant fluency. Andrew tries to help her reach the Rusty Ruins, though he says that they are beyond the end of the world. Through their travels, Tally comes to deduce that the villagers are living in a forcefield-protected reservation where Specials and Pretty Scientists conduct experiments about violence and ways to reduce mankind's violent nature. During this time, Tally starts to wonder if Dr. Cable's words to her have some truth - perhaps the Pretty operation that clouds everyone's minds is the only way that humans can live in peace, without destroying each other or the planet. Tally steals a hovercar from the visiting scientists to escape to the Rusty Ruins. When she calls, she sees someone coming down on a hover board and is shocked to find that it is David who has come to take her to the New Smoke. When she arrives, Maddy tells her that the pills she and Zane took separately were meant to be taken together. One of the pills contained the nanos that were supposed to eat away the lesions, but they ate more of Zane‚Äôs brain tissue than the lesions because they needed the pill that Tally took to stop them. Tally, in fact, cured herself, since the pill that she took only stopped nanos; it did not contain nanos itself to heal the lesions. They soon discover that, when Zane went to the hospital for his headaches, a tracker chip was put in his tooth. Tally decides to stay with Zane instead of escaping with David. David believes that she only loves Zane because he is a Pretty. To make David leave and not get caught himself, Tally tells him to \\"get his ugly face out of here\\". It has the desired result and he flees. She stays with Zane which leads to her getting caught by the Specials along with Fausto. She discovers Shay has been turned into a Special. The book ends with Shay saying 'face it Tally-wa, you're special..

It is used to separate one chemical compound or one class of chemical compounds from one or more other chemical compounds to provide significant quantities of the purified or enriched material at a lower cost than could be obtained using simple (batch) chromatography. It cannot provide any separation or purification that cannot be done by a simple column purification. The process is rather complicated. The single advantage which it brings to a chromatographic purification is that it allows the production of large quantities of highly purified material at a dramatically reduced cost. The cost reductions come about as a result of: the use of a smaller amount of chromatographic separation media stationary phase, a continuous and high rate of production, and decreased solvent and energy requirements. This improved economic performance is brought about by a valve-and-column arrangement that is used to lengthen the stationary phase indefinitely and allow very high solute loadings to the process. In the conventional moving bed technique of production chromatography the feed entry and the analyte recovery are simultaneous and continuous, but because of practical difficulties with a continuously moving bed, the simulated moving bed technique was proposed. In the simulated moving bed technique instead of moving the bed, the feed inlet, the solvent or eluent inlet and the desired product exit and undesired product exit positions are moved continuously, giving the impression of a moving bed, with continuous flow of solid particles and continuous flow of liquid in the opposite direction of the solid particles.Bailly, M. and Nicoud, R.-M. (LSGC- ENSIC, 1, rue Grandville, 54001 Nancy and SEPAREX, 5, rue Monod, 54250, Champigneulle, France): The simulated moving bed: a powerful process for purification True moving bed chromatography (TMBC) is only a theoretical concept. Its simulation, SMBC, is achieved by the use of a multiplicity of columns in series and a complex valve arrangement, which provides for flow of the feed mixture and solvent, and \\"eluent\\" or \\"desorbent\\" feed at any column. The valving and piping arrangements and the predetermined control of these allow switching at regular intervals the sample entry in one direction, the solvent entry in the same direction but at a different location in the continuous loop, whilst changing the fast product and slow product takeoff positions to also move in the same direction, but at different relative locations within the loop. Ref 3 explains that the advantage of the SMBC is high production rate, because a system could be near continuous, whilst its disadvantage is that it only performs one cut in mixtures. Thus, it is well- suited for separation of a binary mixture. With multiple cuts, analogous to a series of distillation columns, multiple compounds can be separated from a mixture of more than two compounds. With regard to efficiency it compares with the simple chromatography technique like continuous distillation does with batch distillation. Construction Specifically, an SMB system has two or more identical columns, which are connected to the mobile phase pump, and each other, by a multi-port valve. The plumbing is configured in such a way that: :a) all columns will be connected in series, forming a single continuous loop; :b) typically, between each column there will be provisions for four process streams: incoming feed mixture, exiting purified fast component, exiting purified slow component, and incoming solvent or eluent; and :c) each process stream (two inlets and two outlets) will proceed in the same direction after a set time (the steptime). Advantages SMB provides lower production cost by requiring less column volume, less chromatographic separation media (\\"packing\\" or \\"stationary phase\\"), using less solvent and less energy, and requiring far less labor. At industrial scale an SMB chromatographic separator is operated continuously, requiring less resin and less solvent than batch chromatography. The continuous operation facilitates operation control and integration into production plants. Low eluent consumption High product concentration High productivity Continuous process This system is useful in the supercritical fluid extraction to obtain large quantity of specific product. Drawbacks The drawbacks of the SMB are higher investment cost compared to single column operations, a higher complexity, as well as higher maintenance costs. But these drawbacks are effectively compensated by the better yield and a much lower solvent consumption as well as a much higher productivity compared to simple batch separations. For purifications, in particular the isolation of an intermediate single component or a fraction out of a multicomponent mixture, the SMB is not as ideally suited. Normally, a single SMB will separate only two fractions from each other, but a series or \\"train\\" of SMBs can perform multiple cuts and purify one or more products from a multi-component mixture. SMB is not readily suited for solvent gradients. Solvent gradient purification may be preferred for the purification of some biomolecules. A continuous chromatography technique to overcome the two fraction limit and to apply gradients is multicolumn countercurrent solvent gradient purification (MCSGP). Applications In size exclusion chromatography, where the separation process is driven by entropy, it is not possible to increase the resolution attained by a column via temperature or solvent gradients. Consequently, these separations often require SMB, to extend usable retention time differences between the molecules or particles being separated. SMB is also very useful in the pharmaceutical industry, where separation of molecules having different chirality must be done on a very large scale. For the purification of fructose, e.g. in high fructose corn syrup, or amino-acids, biological-acids, etc. on an industrial scale, simulated moving bed chromatography is used in order to improve the economics of the production.

He was the leader of the Evans-Sontag Gang.  Outlaw activities  Evans was accused of robbing the Southern Pacific Railroad in California between 1889 and 1892. After killing a member of a posse outside his home on the outskirts of Visalia, he fled to the Sierra Nevada mountains with his younger partner, John Sontag. While Evans and Sontag hid out, writers Ambrose Bierce and Joaquin Miller championed their cause in the San Francisco Examiner. The outlaws evaded capture for ten months. They had a shootout with a posse at the Young cabin which resulted in the death of Wilson, the posse leader, and McGinnis, a former friend of Chris Evans. Later, John Sontag was mortally wounded in what is called the Battle of Stone Corral. Evans was himself severely wounded at Stone Corral, having lost an eye and his left arm. He was taken into custody and convicted of murder and sentenced to life in Folsom State Prison in Folsom, California. John Sontag's younger brother, George Contant, testified against Evans and hence acquired the lifelong hatred of Evans' family.  Later life  After Evans served for seventeen years at Folsom, he was paroled in 1911 by Governor Hiram Johnson, a liberal Republican, who had been elected on an anti-Southern Pacific campaign theme. Banished from California, he died in Portland, Oregon, in 1917, denying to the end that he had ever robbed a train and continuing to assert that he had killed only in self-defense. He also wrote a socialist book which calls for expanded government to check what he viewed as the abuses of the business community. Evans is interred in Portland at Mount Calvary Cemetery. An accomplice to the Evans-Sontag Gang was Ed Morrell, who served fourteen years total in Folsom and San Quentin. Championed by author Jack London, Morrell was pardoned in 1908 and thereafter became a well-known advocate for prison reform.  Legacy  Morris Ankrum and John Smith portrayed Evans and Sontag, respectively, in an episode of the 1955 syndicated television series Stories of the Century, starring and hosted by Jim Davis.

It continues the story of the protagonist, Tally Youngblood. Plot introduction The Uglies series is set at least three centuries in the future, after current civilization was destroyed by a bacterium which de-established all petroleum products, causing widespread chaos. The survivors of this disaster established cities much smaller than those currently existing, each of which is independently governed with limited traveling. At the age of sixteen, each person undergoes an operation which boosts their immune system and reflexes while giving them well-proportioned, symmetrical faces based on an international standard, so that all pretties look nearly identical. They are also given brain lesions which make them peaceful and compliant. Before they receive the operation, children are referred to as \\"uglies\\", and are kept separate from their older friends. Later operations follow to show signs of increasing age while maintaining their beauty, and the lesions may be removed for pretties entering careers which require quick thinking. Pretties who work for Special Circumstances, a clique which ensures the city's security, are given an operation to make them look terrifying, become very strong and fast, and have incredibly fast reflexes. Specials also receive brain surgery to make them feel superior to others and have heightened feelings of rage and euphoria. Plot summary The third novel in the Uglies series begins two months after events in Pretties, when Tally Youngblood has become a member of an elite group of \\"Specials\\" - surgically enhanced super-humans - called the Cutters. The Cutters were founded by Shay, who invented the use of ritual self-harm to become \\"bubbly\\" and clear-headed in spite of brain lesions used to make her pretty-minded. All of the specials in this group were able to get rid of the brain lesions on their own, and now live in the wild. They were adopted into Special Circumstances and given enhanced senses, strength and reflexes, and are among the youngest agents working for Dr. Cable. The Cutters disguise themselves as Uglies in order to crash a party in Uglyville and search for members of the New Smoke. Tally successfully finds a girl giving out pills which cure the pretty lesions, which she encourages the Uglies to take to the Crims - Tally and Shay's old clique. The Cutters attempt to capture the girl, but she escapes on a hoverboard with David's help. Giving chase, the Cutters are ambushed by Smokies with unusually advanced technology, including infra-red masking sneak suits and electrical weapons. The Smokies kidnap Fausto, one of the Cutters, and leave Shay and Tally injured. Hearing that the pills are intended for Zane, Tally insists on going to see her boyfriend, who suffered brain damage in New Pretty Town and has been hospitalized since Tally turned Special. Tally discovers that while Zane is free of the pretty lesions, his brain has been damaged and his physical infirmity now disgusts her. She begins to wonder if she received a brain operation when being made Special which has given her feelings of superiority. Eager to show Dr. Cable that Zane is cured so that he will be made Special, Shay and Tally break into the city Armory to steal something to cut off Zane's tracking necklace. They succeed, but in the attempt, they accidentally destroy much of the Armory, putting the city on high alert. Then, they begin to secretly track Zane and the Crims as they journey to the New Smoke, although the pair split up when Tally receives a guide to the New Smoke from her friend Andrew Simpson Smith, an escapee villager from a reservation of primitive culture. Shay follows the guide straight to the Smoke, but Tally insists on staying with Zane. On the journey, Zane notices Tally and confronts her about her reasons for following him. The pair kiss, but Tally is still repulsed by Zane's tremors and runs away from him. Tally continues to follow the group to the New Smoke - a city called Diego, which accepts runaways freely, having widely adopted the pretty cure and rejected the rules about surgery, allowing anyone to look how they please rather than following the international standard. Tally is amazed by this, but horrified to hear that Diego is beginning to expand into the wild, clear- cutting forest like the Rusties did. Tally finds Fausto at a party for newly arrived runaways, but realizes his Special brain surgery has been cured. He had given informed consent before he became special to take a \\"cure\\" for having a special brain. Tally only just escapes being forcibly injected. Her escape attempt leaves her helpless, as she jumps off a cliff with only crash bracelets to catch her fall. She is picked up by Diego's authorities and locked up for her lethal strength and weapon-sharp teeth and fingernails, which they insist on removing. The doctors inform her that she has received brain surgery to give her flashes of anger and euphoria, along with feelings of superiority, although they will not change this without her consent. With Shay's help, Tally escapes just before the surgery begins. Shay and the other Cutters have all been cured by Fausto, but they want Tally's help to protect Diego from imminent attack by Dr. Cable, who is blaming the so-called New System for the attack on the armory. Tally assists in the evacuation of the hospital, but learns after the attack that Zane, having just received surgery to cure his tremors, died of complications during the confusion of the attack. Grief-stricken, Tally leaves immediately to tell Dr. Cable the truth about the attack on the armory. Just before she reaches the city, she meets David, who took a helicopter to talk to her in time. He tells her that he still believes she can think her own way out of her brain surgery, but gives her an injector full of the cure so that she has the option of curing herself. Arriving at Special Circumstances headquarters, Tally finds that Dr. Cable and the Specials have taken control of the city. Dr. Cable knows that Tally was responsible for the attack, but has chosen to use the attack as a way to seize control over both this city and Diego. Tally tricks Dr. Cable into stabbing herself on the injector, and is imprisoned underground for a month, watching the feeds as Dr. Cable slowly loses her grip on the city and the cure begins to spread. Diego publishes scans of Tally's Special body, calling her a \\"morphological violation,\\" and the world is outraged by Dr. Cable's \\"secret\\" experiments on unconsenting teenagers. Eventually, Tally is taken as the last remaining Special to be \\"despecialized,\\" but she resists the surgeons and breaks out with Dr. Cable's help, becoming the only true Special left. She returns to David, still waiting at the Rusty Ruins, and realizes that her other friends have all found their places in the New System. She decides that she wishes to remain in the wild, free from surgery, and with David she will form the \\"New Special Circumstances,\\" ensuring that nature is protected from humanity's excesses.

Bahnsen is usually considered the originator of characterology and a real-dialectical method of philosophical reflection which he laid down in his two-volume Contributions to Characterology (1867) and developed forth with his following works, amongst others his magnum opus The Contradiction in the Knowledge and Being of the World (1880/82). Biography Born in Tondern (T√∏nder), Schleswig, in 1830 Bahnsen began his study of philosophy and (under Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch) philology in Kiel. From 1849 he fought as a volunteer against the Danes in the First War of Schleswig (1848‚Äì1851) and fled to T√ºbingen in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg after the disarming of Schleswig- Holstein's army in 1850. There he studied philosophy and in 1853 graduated under Friedrich Theodor Vischer with a topic relating to the aesthetics. Various employments as a teacher followed. In 1862, Bahnsen acquired an employment at a progymnasium in Lauenburg (Lƒôbork), Hinterpommern, where he lived until his death. Philosophical work As a disciple of Schopenhauer, Bahnsen dared a merger of Hegel's dialectic (which Bahnsen, however, accepted only within the realms of the abstract) and Schopenhauer's monism. Though in this connection the reasonless, all-embracing Schopenhauerian will is still accepted as the essence of the world and the only thing real, it doesn't regard the will as being the same within all individuals, but as just as manifold as these individuals. This characterological element of Bahnsen's teachings, on which the works of such philosophers as Ludwig Klages are built upon, is laid down in the Contributions to Characterology (1867) as well as the disquisitions On the Relationship Between Will and Motive (1870) and Mosaics and Silhouettes (1877). Since the nature of unreasonableness consists in contradiction‚Äîparticularly the contemporaneous existence of multiple will directions attaching themselves to each other‚Äîit follows that not only reality is a continuous struggle of material contrasts (real-dialectic), but that the inside of each individual is addicted to the insolvable antagonism of opposite will directions (will collisions) as well. Bahnsen negates a redemption of the countless will units (\\"will henades\\", as he expresses it himself) and postulates the permanence of the existence of the contradiction as a basic nature of the world, whereby the law of this world becomes a tragic world order. The real-dialectical side of his teachings Bahnsen laid down in the paper On the Philosophy of History (1871), his central work The Contradiction in the Knowledge and Being of the World (1880/82), and his anniversary publication to the jubilee of the city T√ºbingen The Tragical as World Law and Humour as Aesthetic Shape of the Metaphysical (1877).  Philosophy  At the beginning of his delve into philosophy, Julius Bahnsen developed an interest in Hegelianism, which was in decline yet still popular in early 19th century Germany. From Hegel's teachings, Bahnsen found his panlogism and radical rationalism dissatisfying. In Bahnsen's view, there was a stark mismatch between the unconcealed irrationality of the world and the naive theories, rationalizations and explanations of various philosophers. Existence itself seemed harsh, confusing and downright contradictory. Starting out from these premises, Bahnsen found Hegel's idea of the dialectic appealing. The dialectic explained the ingrained opposition of the world with itself in a cycle of perpetual conflict (as Heraclitus had observed in his fragments centuries earlier). However, Bahnsen believed that Heraclitus's postulate of an underlying Logos and Hegel's idea of the rational spirit had misled them and had contaminated Hegel's formulation of the dialectic with progressivism and historicism. As a response to this \\"misunderstanding\\", Bahnsen developed his own idea of the Realdialektik. In the Realdialektik, there was no notion of synthesis between two opposing forces. The opposition results only in negation and the consequent destruction of contradicting aspects. For Bahnsen, no rationality was to be found in being and thus, there was no teleological power that led to progress at the end of every conflict. Yet Bahnsen's philosophical system was only taking its very first steps. He accepted a \\"modified\\" form of Hegel's dialectic, but by removing the metaphysical driving entity, there remained a void to be filled in his worldview. This led to Bahnsen's accidental discovery of the World as Will and Representation by Arthur Schopenhauer. After carefully examining this magnum opus and discussing it personally with the Frankfurt philosopher, Bahnsen realized that the metaphysical notion of an irrational will underlying all of creation was just what he needed in his own system. After several years of studying Schopenhauer's works, Bahnsen became very proficient and knowledgeable in the \\"philosophy of will\\". He was regarded as one of the most capable philosophers in the Schopenhauer Schule, rivalled only by Schopenhauer's personal literary executor ‚Äî Julius Frauenst√§dt. However, as Bahnsen's own system matured, he began to deviate from Schopenhauer's teachings in considerable ways. Bahnsen had always harbored an interest in psychology, specifically the method of examination of individual characters and temperaments. He viewed each person as unique and as a result of this view, could not entirely accept Schopenhauer's preference for monism (the idea that every person and every thing is merely a modus of a singular metaphysical entity). Similar to fellow german pessimist Philipp Mainl√§nder, Bahnsen leaned towards ontological pluralism and asserted that there is no unified will, but only individual wills, with their own specific cravings, aims and wishes. However, these individual wills (\\"will henades\\") suffer from contradictory desires due to their irrational nature. This is the result of Bahnsen's combination of Schopenhauer's voluntaristic metaphysic and his own ideas of the Realdialektik. A crucial difference between Schopenhauer's worldview, which offers salvation for some via the freed Intellect's silencing of the will, and that of Bahnsen is that, in Bahnsen's philosophical system ‚Äî there is no salvation. For Bahnsen, without the will the intellect is impotent. It cannot \\"will\\" nothingness, for a will-to-nothingness is still a form of willing, and willing non-willing is a contradiction. Yet it is not impossible for the intellect to have such ideas as, according to Bahnsen, all ideas bred by the intellect are contradictory as the will's desires are irrational and eternally in conflict with themselves. This extremely pessimistic worldview, which offers no escape for the subject, differentiates Bahnsen not only from Schopenhauer, but also from the rest of his pessimistic contemporaries (Frauenst√§dt, Mainl√§nder, Hartmann). His ideas are arguably more unsettling than Mainl√§nder's notion of a will-to-die, yet strangely similar to Friedrich Nietszche's idea of the eternal return.  Correspondence with Hartmann  Bahnsen developed a close friendship with fellow philosopher Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann, until they eventually fell out and became philosophical rivals. This is not surprising, as both thinkers had similar philosophical beginnings and influences, yet differed crucially in their interpretation of these influences. Hartmann placed Schopenhauer's idea of an ever-desiring will within the unconscious psyche of the subject, while accepting Hegel's underlying rationalism and historicism. Hartmann had an affinity for pantheist monism, and asserted that the will and the rational spirit were ultimately one and the same. In contrast, Bahnsen rejected Hegel's rationalism and accepted his dialectic in a negative form, while integrating it with a pluralized version of Schopenhauer's metaphysics of will. This is a rather ironic demonstration of Bahnsen's idea of existence as contradiction, as Bahnsen and Hartmann's interest in both philosophers both drew them together and created contention within their friendship. Hartmann criticized Bahnsen's pluralism and claimed that the common point between all \\"individual wills\\" is a singular will. Whilst Bahnsen criticized Hartmann, claiming that his \\"Hegelian rationalism\\" corrupted the teachings of Schopenhauer's essentially purposeless will. Hegel's spirit could not be combined with the Schopenhauerian will, Bahnsen asserted, because this geist is teleological and has always had an end-goal. The will has no goals for that would require rationality and Schopenhauer was clear that the intellect was only an accidental slave to the will, and not an essential feature to it. Hartmann defended himself by claiming that the will itself was irrational and precisely because of this, it needed the spirit to direct it towards a goal. Otherwise, creation could not have occurred. The representations we observe are the will's only goals and these representations are evidently rational. Bahnsen countered that feeling is the will's non-representational goal and that not all of the will's aims are rational. This debate could not be resolved, as Hartmann regarded feeling as an unconscious representation, while Bahnsen could not bring himself to accept the unprovable reality of this so-called \\"unconscious representation\\". Additionally, Bahnsen disagreed with Hartmann on fundamental points. If the will and the (rational) ideas are different (as Hartmann claimed), how do the Ideas influence the Will at all if they don't have a will of their own? Hartmann would claim that they are \\"different, yet unified\\", staying true to his monism. Yet, this would appear as a contradiction to Bahnsen and would further solidify the power of Bahnsen's own convictions and conclusions stemming from his Realdialektik. As for Hartmann, he did not accept Bahnsen's theories and diagnosed him with a psychopathic melancholy and a philosophical inability to distinguish \\"conflict\\" from \\"contradiction\\".  Theory of tragedy  Bahnsen's theory of tragedy derived directly and naturally from the contradictory ideas of his Realdialektik. In his own time, the acclaimed theories of tragedy were those of Schiller and Hegel. For them, the correct moral choice in a tragic hero's circumstances is always clear and extremely painful, precisely because of these circumstances. I.e. no matter how clear this choice is, it is always difficult to choose it. A good example is Hegel, who claims that we must always choose the good of the collective, regardless of how difficult this would be for the particular individual. Bahnsen disagreed with such a notion. For him, a clear choice is never obvious, there's not even a clear choice to be had. In tragedy, the hero must choose between his duties and/or his values. Whatever he chooses, he will sin and be punished for not choosing the other (punished either by law or by guilt). From this observation, Bahnsen concluded that tragedy exposes precisely this inner contradiction that is inherent in the world. In his 2016 work Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900 the American professor of philosophy Frederick Beiser expresses Bahnsen's views: \\"The fate of the modern individual is that he or she must choose between these values and these worldviews, where the choice cannot be exclusive, moral, correct or rational. This is the tragic fate.\\" This is why Bahnsen claims that ultimately, reason cannot help us in our lives and that our choices must be dictated by feeling. A few years before Nietzsche developed his perspectivism and Kierkegaard wrote that all choices lead to sorrow and regret, Bahnsen had already foreseen these conclusions. He complained that a typical christian missionary would claim that one should just \\"do the right thing and be rewarded\\", yet there is not one \\"right\\" thing. Each moral choice has consequences and all of them have both advantages and disadvantages. In the face of such a dire existence, Bahnsen views humour as almost sacred. It alone gives us the ability to \\"laugh off\\" the tragedy of being and to avoid the clutches of depression.  Transcendental realism  During the end of his life, Bahnsen completed his philosophical project. Despite constant editions and slight changes in details, three principle premises remained throughout Bahnsen's philosophy: 1) Contradiction exists in the heart of reality, and is not a mere attribute of our thoughts about reality 2) Contradiction does not get resolved in synthesis 3) The source of contradiction is the will Other than rejecting Hegel's progressivism and reinterpreting Schopenhauer's singular will, Bahnsen also denied all forms of idealism. For him, the ideas of idealism are inherently solipsistic and do not take into consideration the unique reality of the individual wills of other people. For this reason and for other more technical purposes, Bahnsen agreed with his fellow pessimists Julius Frauenst√§dt, Philipp Mainl√§nder and Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann that transcendental realism is superior to transcendental idealism.  Bahnsen's interpretation of pessimism  At the end of his life, Bahnsen wrote an article on pessimism, attempting to distinguish his own pessimism from that of his contemporaries. According to this article, Bahnsen found his position to be opposed to idealistic optimism and deprecating cynicism. He stated that the pessimist preserves his \\"idealist heart\\" but utilizes the \\"cold calculation of the head\\" to strike a middle ground. Thus, the pessimist realizes that alleviating the suffering of all (even of one) is next to impossible, yet the grief caused by this impossibility strengthens the pessimist's tireless pursuit of this goal, instead of demoralizing him/her. Because he feels the \\"weltschmerz\\" of being, he is fueled even further by empathy and compassion. Bahnsen was critical of \\"hedonistic\\" pessimism - the position that the pains of the world outnumber its pleasures in quality and quantity. Once more, the philosopher reasserted his convictions regarding individualism and claimed that such a calculus was impossible to make, as it would measure each individual differently. There are other reasons to be pessimistic about the world, he claimed: To realize that all moral aims and ideals are futile, yet to pursue them nonetheless, knowing full well that there is no exit or salvation ‚Äî that is true pessimism.

Igneous bodies lie across the northern half of the state, with intrusions throughout the northwest and basalts and other igneous rocks of the Duluth Complex and Beaver Bay Complex from the Midcontinent Rift System bordering Lake Superior in the northeast. In the southeast along the Mississippi River, up through the Twin Cities, canyons carve into Cambrian and Ordovician bedrock that were formed in shallow tropical seas that covered southern and south- central Minnesota during that time. The geology of the southwest includes old rocks, the 3.6 billion year old Morton Gneiss and the Paleoproterozoic Sioux Quartzite, overlain by the Cretaceous sedimentary sequence that includes the Dakota Sandstone, Niobrara Formation, and Pierre Shale, and is continuous across much of the western Midwest to the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Central Minnesota contains an ancient fault system from the Penokean orogeny. The geology of Minnesota comprises the rock, minerals, and soils of the U.S. state of Minnesota, including their formation, development, distribution, and condition. The state's geologic history can be divided into three periods. The first period was a lengthy period of geologic instability from the origin of the planet until roughly 1,100 million years ago. During this time, the state's Precambrian bedrock was formed by volcanism and the deposition of sedimentary rock and then modified by processes such as faulting, folding and erosion. In the second period, many layers of sedimentary rock were formed by deposition and lithification of successive layers of sediment from runoff and repeated incursions of the sea. In the third and most recent period starting about 1.8 million years ago, glaciation eroded previous rock formations and deposited deep layers of glacial till over most of the state, and created the beds and valleys of modern lakes and rivers. Minnesota's geologic resources have been the historical foundation of the state's economy. Precambrian bedrock has been mined for metallic minerals, including iron ore, on which the economy of Northeast Minnesota was built. Archaen granites and gneisses, and later limestones and sandstones, are quarried for structural stone and monuments. Glacial deposits are mined for aggregates, glacial till and lacustrine deposits formed the parent soil for the state's farmlands, and glacial lakes are the backbone of Minnesota's tourist industry. These economic assets have in turn dictated the state's history and settlement patterns, and the trade and supply routes along the waterways, valleys and plains have become the state's state's transportation corridors. Geological history Precambrian bedrock Map of Minnesota bedrock by age. Shaded relief image: Superior Upland in the northeast, the flat Red River Valley in the northwest, Central Minnesota's irregular landscape, the Coteau des Prairies and Minnesota River in the southwest, and the southeast's dissected Driftless Area along the Mississippi River below its confluences with the Minnesota and St. Croix in East Central Minnesota Minnesota contains some of the oldest rocks on Earth, granitic gneisses that formed some 3,600 mya (million years ago) ‚Äî roughly 80% the age of the planet.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota's Geology, p. 23. About 2,700 mya, the first volcanic rocks that would later underlie Minnesota began to rise up out of an ancient ocean, forming the Superior craton.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota's Geology, pp. 25‚Äì32. This craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. Much of the underlying gneiss rock of today's state had already formed nearly a billion years earlier, but lay underneath the sea. Except for an area where islands appeared in what is now the northern part of the state, most of the region remained underwater. In Middle Precambrian time, about 2,000 mya, the land rose above the water. Heavy mineral deposits containing iron had collected on the shores of the receding sea to form the Mesabi, Cuyuna, Vermilion, and Gunflint iron ranges from the center of the state north into Northwestern Ontario, Canada. These regions also showed the first signs of life as algae grew in the shallow waters. Over 1,100 mya, a rift formed and lava emerged from cracks along the edges of the rift valley. This Midcontinent Rift System extended from the lower peninsula of Michigan north to the current Lake Superior, southwest through the lake to the Duluth area, and south through eastern Minnesota down into what is now Kansas.Van Schmus et al., The Midcontinent Rift System, pp. 345, 349. The rifting stopped before the land could become two separate continents. About 100 million years later, the last volcano went quiet. Late Precambrian and Paleozoic sedimentary rock The mountain-building and rifting events left areas of high relief above the low basin of the Midcontinent rift. Over the next 1,100 million years, the uplands were worn down and the rift filled with sediments, forming rock ranging in thickness from several hundred meters near Lake Superior to thousands of meters further south.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, pp. 57‚Äì59. While the crustal tectonic plates continued their slow drift over the surface of the planet, meeting and separating in the successive collision and rifting of continents, the North American craton remained stable. Although now free of folding and faulting caused by plate tectonics, the region continued to experience gradual subsidence and uplift.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, p. 65. Five hundred fifty million years ago, the state was repeatedly inundated with water of a shallow sea that grew and receded through several cycles. The land mass of what is now North America ran along the equator, and Minnesota had a tropical climate.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, pp. 65‚Äì95. Small marine creatures such as trilobites, coral, and snails lived in the sea. The shells of the tiny animals sank to the bottom, and are preserved in limestones, sandstones, and shales from this era. Later, creatures resembling crocodiles and sharks slid through the seas, and fossil shark teeth have been found on the uplands of the Mesabi Range.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota's Geology, pp. 91‚Äì93. During the Mesozoic and Cenozoic other land animals followed as the dinosaurs disappeared, but much of the physical evidence from this era has been scraped away or buried by recent glaciation. The rock units that remain in Minnesota from this time period are of Cambrian and Ordovician age, from the Mount Simon Sandstone at the bottom of the sequence of sedimentary rocks to the Maquoketa Group at the top. Ice ages Northern hemisphere glaciation during the last ice ages. The creation of 3 to 4 km thick ice sheets caused a global sea level drop of about 120 m. In the Quaternary Period starting about two million years ago, glaciers expanded and retreated across the region. The ice retreated for the last time about 12,500 years ago.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, pp. 97, 108. Melting glaciers formed many of the state's lakes and etched its river valleys. They also formed a number of proglacial lakes, which contributed to the state's topography and soils. Principal among these lakes was Lake Agassiz, a massive lake with a volume rivaling that of all the present Great Lakes combined. Dammed by the northern ice sheet, this lake's immense flow found an outlet in glacial River Warren, which drained south across the Traverse Gap through the valleys now occupied by the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. Eventually, the ice sheet melted, and the Red River gave Lake Agassiz a northern outlet toward Hudson Bay. As the lake drained away its bed became peatlands and a fertile plain. Similarly, Glacial Lake Duluth, in the basin of Lake Superior, was dammed by a glacier; it drained down the ancient course of the Midcontinental Rift to the St. Croix River and the Mississippi. When the glaciers receded, the lake was able to drain through the Great Lakes to the Saint Lawrence River. Giant animals roamed the area. Beavers were the size of bears, and mammoths were 14 feet (4.3 m) high at the shoulder and weighed 10 tons. Even buffalo were much larger than today. The glaciers continued to retreat and the climate became warmer over the next few millennia; the giant creatures died out about 9,000 years ago.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, pp. 116‚Äì18. This glaciation has drastically remodeled most of Minnesota, and all but two of the state's regions are covered with deep layers of glacial till.Jirsa and Southwick, Mineral Potential and Geology of Minnesota, Glacial cover in Minnesota. The driftless area of Southeastern Minnesota was untouched by the most recent glaciation. In the absence of glacial scouring and drift, this region presents a widespread highly dissected aspect absent from other parts of the state. Northeastern Minnesota was subject to glaciation and its effects, but its hard Archaen and Proterozoic rocks were more resistant to glacial erosion than the sedimentary bedrock first encountered in many other regions, and glacial till is relatively sparse. While the effects of glacial erosion are clearly present and there are some areas of glacial till, older rocks and landforms remain unburied and exposed across much of the region. Minnesota today Geologic regions Contemporary Minnesota is much quieter geologically than in the past. Outcroppings of lava flows and magma intrusions are the only remaining traces of the volcanism that ended over 1,100 mya. Landlocked within the continent, the state is a long distance from the seas that once covered it, and the continental glacier has receded entirely from North America. Minnesota's landscape is a relatively flat peneplain; its highest and lowest points are separated by only of elevation. While the state no longer has true mountain ranges or oceans, there is a fair amount of regional diversity in landforms and geological history, which in turn has affected Minnesota's settlement patterns, human history, and economic development. These diverse geological regions can be classified several ways. The classification used below principally derives from Sansome's Minnesota Underfoot - A Field Guide to Minnesota's Geology, but is also influenced by Minnesota's Geology by Ojakangas and Matsch. These authorities generally agree on areal borders, but the regions as defined by Ojakangas and Matsch are more geographical in their approximations of areas of similar geology, while Sansome's divisions are more irregular in shape in order to include within a region all areas of similar geology, with particular emphasis on the effects of recent glaciation. As glaciation and its residue has largely dictated regional surface geology and topography, Sansome's divisions are often coextensive with ecological provinces, sections, and subsections.Ecological Classification System, Ecological Land Classification Hierarchy. Northeastern Minnesota: ancient bedrock Northeastern Minnesota is an irregularly-shaped region composed of the northeasternmost part of the state north of Lake Superior, the area around Jay Cooke State Park and the Nemadji River basin southwest of Duluth, and much of the area east of U.S. Highway 53 that runs between Duluth and International Falls. Excluded are parts of the beds of glacial lakes Agassiz and Upham, the latter now occupied by the upper valley of the Saint Louis River and its tributary the Cloquet. This area is coextensive with the Northern Superior Uplands Section of the Laurentian Mixed Forest.Ecological Classification System, Northern Superior Uplands Section. The Mesabi and Gunflint Ranges, once part of a single mountain range, were split when the center was engulfed by magma blistering up during the Midcontinent Rift, creating the Duluth Complex. Lava from the rift formed dense volcanic rocks which sank, creating the Lake Superior basin, edged by the North Shore Volcanic Group along the lakeshore. Known as the Arrowhead for its shape, this region shows the most visible evidence of the state's violent past. There are surface exposures of rocks first formed in volcanic activity some 2,700 mya during construction of the Archaen-Superior province,Van Schmus et al., The Midcontinent Rift System, p. 348. including Ely greenstone, metamorphosed and highly folded volcanics once thought to be the oldest exposed rock on earth;Chandler, A Geophysical Investigation of the Ely Greenstone Belt in the Soudan Area , pp. 4‚Äì5; Nute, Rainy River Country, p. 3. Older rocks have since been found in Minnesota (the Morton gneiss of Southeast Minnesota) and Greenland and Labrador. Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota's Geology, p. 24. Proterozoic formations created about 1,900 mya that gave the area most of its mineral riches; and more recent intrusive gabbro and extrusive basalts and rhyolites of the Duluth Complex and North Shore Volcanic Group, created by magma and lava which upwelled and hardened about 1,100 mya during the Midcontinent Rift.Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot: A Field Guide to Minnesota's Geology, pp. 19, 30, 36; Ojakagas and Matsch, Minnesota's Geology, pp. 37‚Äì40, 50‚Äì55, 191. The Precambrian bedrock formed by this activity has been eroded but remains at or close to the surface over much of the area. The entire area is the raw southern edge of the Canadian Shield. Topsoils are thin and poor and their parent soils derived from the rock beneath or nearby rather than from glacial till, which is sparse.Heinselman, The Boundary Waters Wilderness Ecosystem, pp. 13‚Äì14. Many of this region's lakes are located in depressions formed by the differential erosion of tilted layers of bedded rock of the Canadian Shield; the crevasses thereby formed have filled with water to create many of the thousands of lakes and swamps of the Superior National Forest.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, pp. 185, 190‚Äì91. In post- glacial times Northeastern Minnesota was covered by forest broken only by these interconnected lakes and wetlands. Much of the area has been little changed by human activity, as there are substantial forest and wilderness preserves, most notably the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and Voyageurs National Park. In the remainder of the region, lakes provide recreation, forests are managed for pulpwood, and the underlying bedrock is mined for valuable ores deposited in Precambrian times. While copper and nickel ores have been mined, the principal metallic mineral is iron. Three of Minnesota's four iron ranges are in the region, including the Mesabi Range, which has supplied over 90% of the state's historic output, including most of the natural ores pure enough to be fed directly into furnaces. The state's iron mines have produced over three and a half billion metric tons of ore. While high-grade ores have now been exhausted, lower-grade taconite continues to supply a large proportion of the nation's needs. Northwestern Minnesota: glacial lakebed Northwestern Minnesota is a vast plain in the bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This plain extends north and northwest from the Big Stone Moraine, beyond Minnesota's borders into Canada and North Dakota. In the northeast, the Glacial Lake Agassiz plain transitions into the forests of the Arrowhead. The region includes the lowland portions of the Red River watershed and the western half of the Rainy River watershed within the state, at approximately the level of Lake Agassiz‚Äô Herman Beach.Compare regional map at Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot at p. 173, with image showing Herman Beach at Ojakanas and Matsch, Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, at p. 201. The upland portions of the Red River watershed atop the moraine are different in character, with gravelly soil, lakes, and other glacial landforms, and therefore are assigned to the Central Minnesota region. In ecological terms, it includes the Northern Minnesota Peatlands of the Laurentian Mixed Forest,Ecological Classification System, Northern Minnesota and Ontario Peatlands Section the Tallgrass Aspen Parklands,Ecological Classification System, Tallgrass Aspen Parklands Province. and the Red River Valley Section of the Prairie Parklands.Ecological Classification System, Red River Valley Section. Bedrock in this region is mainly Archean, with small areas of Lower Paleozoic and Upper Mesozoic sedimentary rocks along the western border.Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot, p. 9 (\\"Bedrock Geology Map\\"). By late Wisconsinan times this bedrock had been covered by clayey glacial drift scoured and transported from sedimentary rocks of Manitoba. The bottomland is undissected and essentially flat, but imperceptibly declines from about 400 meters at the southern beaches of Lake Agassiz to 335 meters along the Rainy River. There is almost no relief, except for benches or beaches where Glacial Lake Agassiz stabilized for a time before it receded to a lower level. In contrast to the lakebed, these beaches rise from the south to the north and east at a gradient of approximately 1:5000; this rise resulted from the isostatic rebound of the land after recession of the last ice sheet.Heinselman, Forest Sites, Bog Processes, and Peatland Types in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Region, Minnesota , p. 331. In the western part of the region in the Red River Valley, fine-grained glacial lake deposits and decayed organic materials up to 50 meters in depth form rich, well-textured, and moisture-retentive, yet well-drained soils (mollisols), which are ideal for agriculture.Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot, p. 174, 181. To the north and east, much of the land is poorly drained peat, often organized in rare and distinctive patterns known as patterned peatland.Heinselman, Forest Sites, Bog Processes, and Peatland Types in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Region, Minnesota , pp. 354‚Äì61; Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot, pp. 191‚Äì93. At marginally higher elevations within these wetlands are areas of black spruce, tamarack, and other water-tolerant species. Southwestern Minnesota: glacial river and glacial till Relief map of Southwestern Minnesota, transected by the Minnesota River in the valley of the glacial River Warren. To the northwest, the faint U-shaped Big Stone Moraine; the triangular wedge in the southwest is the Coteau des Prairies. The rough-appearing areas to the north and east are part of Central Minnesota. Southwestern Minnesota is in the watersheds of the Minnesota River, the Missouri River, and the Des Moines River.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, p. 223; Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot, pp. 110‚Äì11. The Minnesota River lies in the bed of the glacial River Warren, a much larger torrent that drained Lake Agassiz while outlets to the north were blocked by glaciers. The Coteau des Prairies divides the Minnesota and Missouri River valleys, and is a striking landform created by the bifurcation of different lobes of glacial advance. On the Minnesota side of the coteau is a feature known as Buffalo Ridge, where wind speeds average 16 mph (26 km/h). This windy plateau is being developed for commercial wind power, contributing to the state's ranking as third in the nation for wind-generated electricity. Between the river and the plateau are flat prairies atop varying depths of glacial till. In the extreme southwest portion of the state, bedrock outcroppings of Sioux Quartzite are common, with less common interbedded outcrops of an associated metamorphosed mudstone named catlinite. Pipestone, Minnesota is the site of historic Native American quarries of catlinite, which is more commonly known as \\"pipestone\\". Another notable outcrop in the region is the Jeffers Petroglyphs, a Sioux Quartzite outcropping with numerous petroglyphs which may be up to 7000‚Äì9000 years old. Drier than most of the rest of the state, the region is a transition zone between the prairies and the Great Plains. Once rich in wetlands known as prairie potholes, 90%, or some three million acres (12,000 km¬≤), have been drained for agriculture in the Minnesota River basin. Most of the prairies are now farm fields. Due to the quaternary and bedrock geology of the region, as well as the reduced precipitation in the region, groundwater resources are neither plentiful, nor widely distributed, unlike most other areas of the state. Given these constraints, this rural area hosts a vast network of water pipelines which transports groundwater from the few localized areas with productive groundwater wells to much of the region's population. Southeastern Minnesota: bluffs, caves and sinkholes Root River in Olmsted County Relief map of Southeastern Minnesota: Owatonna Moraine on extreme west; junction of the state's principal rivers in Central Minnesota in northwest; the Wisconsin border along the Mississippi River to the east. Southeastern Minnesota is separated from Southwestern Minnesota by the Owatonna Moraine, the eastern branch of the Bemis Moraine, a terminal moraine of the Des Moines lobe from the last Wisconsin glaciation. Ojakangas and Matsch extend the region west past the moraine to a line running north from the Iowa border between Mankato and New Ulm to the latitude of the Twin Cities, then encompassing the latter metropolis with a broad arc east to the St. Croix River.Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, p. 222 (map). This moraine runs south from the Twin Cities in the general area of Minnesota State Highway 13 and Interstate 35. Sansome attaches this moraine to her description of West- Central Minnesota, given its similarity in glacial features to that region.Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot, p. 110. Under Sansome's classification (followed here), Southeastern Minnesota is generally coterminous with the Paleozoic Plateau Section of the Eastern Broadleaf Forest Province.Ecological Classification System, Paleozoic Plateau Section. The bedrock here is lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, with limestone and dolomite especially prevalent near the surface. It is highly dissected, and local tributaries of the Mississippi have cut deep valleys into the bedrock. It is an area of karst topography, with thin topsoils lying atop porous limestones, leading to formation of caverns and sinkholes. The last glaciation did not cover this region (halting at the Des Moines terminal lobe mentioned above), so there is no glacial drift to form subsoils, giving the region the name of the Driftless area. As the topsoils are shallower and poorer than those to the west, dairy farming rather than cash crops is the principal agricultural activity. Central Minnesota: knob and kettle country Map of soils and sediments constituting Quaternary geology of Minnesota. Central Minnesota is composed of (1) the drainage basin of the St. Croix River (2) the basin of the Mississippi River above its confluence with the Minnesota, (3) those parts of the Minnesota and Red River basins on the glacial uplands forming the divides of those two basins with that of the Mississippi, (4) the Owatonna Moraine atop a strip of land running from western Hennepin County south to the Iowa border, and (5) the upper valley of the Saint Louis River and the valley of its principal tributary the Cloquet River which once drained to the Mississippi before they were captured by stream piracy and their waters were redirected through the lower Saint Louis River to Lake Superior.Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot, p. 129-31.While Sansome places the north bank of the Minnesota River in this region, this article follows Ojakangas and Matsch in assigning the lowlands along the north bank to Southwest Minnesota, and the uplands to Central Minnesota. Compare regional map at Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot at p. 109, with Ojakanas and Matsch, Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, at p. 222. Glacial landforms are the common characteristics of this gerrymander-like region. The bedrock ranges in age from Archean granites to Upper Mesozoic Cretaceous sediments,Sansome, Minnesota Underfoot, p. 9 (\\"Bedrock Geologic Map\\"). and underlying the eastern part of the region (and the southerly extension to Iowa) are the Late Precambrian Keweenawan volcanics of the Midcontinent Rift, overlaid by thousands of meters of sedimentary rocks.Ojakangas and Matsch, Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, p. 59. At the surface, the entire region is \\"Moraine terrain\\", with the glacial landforms of moraines, drumlins, eskers, kames, outwash plains and till plains, all relics from recent glaciation. In the multitude of glacier-formed depressions are wetlands and many of the state's \\"10,000 lakes\\", which make the area prime vacation territory. The glacial deposits are a source of aggregate, and underneath the glacial till are high- quality granites which are quarried for buildings and monuments. East Central Minnesota: bedrock valleys and outwash plain Relief map of the eastern part of Central Minnesota: Mississippi River enters from northwest and crosses diagonally to the southeast; Minnesota River in the valley of River Warren enters from the south; St. Croix enters from northeast. East Central Minnesota is composed of the eastern half and all territory on the image north of the Mississippi. gorge of Minnehaha Creek The subregion of East Central Minnesota is that part of Central Minnesota near the junction of three of the state's great rivers. Included are Dakota County, eastern Hennepin County, and the region north of the Mississippi but south of an east-west line from Saint Cloud to the St. Croix River on the Wisconsin border. It includes much of the Twin Cities metropolitan area.Ojakangas and Matsch attach the metropolitan area to Southeastern Minnesota. Minnesota‚Äôs Geology, p. 232 (map). The region has the same types of glacial landforms as the remainder of Central Minnesota, but is distinguished by its bedrock valleys, both active and buried. The valleys now hold three of Minnesota's largest rivers, which join here. The St. Croix joins the Mississippi at Prescott, Wisconsin. Upstream, the Mississippi is joined by the Minnesota River at historic Fort Snelling. When River Warren Falls receded past the confluence of the much smaller Upper Mississippi River, a new waterfall was created where that river entered the much-lower River Warren. The new falls receded upstream on the Mississippi, migrating eight miles (13 km) over 9600 years to where Louis Hennepin first saw it and named St. Anthony Falls in 1680. Due to its value as a power source, this waterfall determined the location of Minneapolis. One tributary of the river coming from the west, Minnehaha Creek, receded only a few hundred yards from one of the channels of the Mississippi. Minnehaha Falls remains as a picturesque and informative relic of River Warren Falls, and the limestone-over-sandstone construction is readily apparent in its small gorge. At St. Anthony Falls, the Mississippi dropped over a limestone ledge; these waterfalls were used to drive the flour mills that were the foundation for the city's 19th century growth. Other bedrock tunnel valleys lie deep beneath till deposited by the glaciers which created them, but can be traced in many places by the Chain of Lakes in Minneapolis and lakes and dry valleys in St. Paul. North of the metropolitan area is the Anoka Sandplain, a flat area of sandy outwash from the last ice age. Along the eastern edge of the region are the Dalles of the St. Croix River, a deep gorge cut by runoff from Glacial Lake Duluth into ancient bedrock. Interstate Park here contains the southernmost surface exposure of the Precambrian lava flows of the Midcontinent Rift, providing a glimpse of Minnesota's volcanic past.

Although he never achieved greatness, he was admired by close friends and relatives, and also served his father most loyally and shared his ideals. Marcus was renowned for being a man of gallantry and warm temperament.  Biography  He was the brother of Porcia Catonis, who was first married to Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus (co-consul with Caesar in 59 BC); she later married their half-cousin (on the maternal side) Marcus Junius Brutus. Marcus fought in the Battle of Thapsus, and after being defeated by Caesar's forces his father Cato committed suicide in 46 BC. Julius Caesar pardoned young Cato and allowed him to keep his father's property. In spite of being pardoned by Caesar and allowed to return home, Marcus joined his brother-in-law Brutus and his ally Gaius Cassius Longinus, who both assassinated Julius Caesar on March 15, 44 BC. Afterwards they fled Rome headed for Greece, where Marcus Cato fought in both of the battles of Philippi. He was killed in the second battle of Philippi in 42 BC (at the age of 31). According to Plutarch, as the army of the Liberators routed, Marcus refused to retreat and instead charged into the enemy ranks, allegedly without helmet or armor, to meet his death.

Background  Out of the mare Mari's Sheba, a granddaughter of Northern Dancer, his sire was Arazi, the 1991 European Horse of the Year. Mari's Sheba was Gr.I placed during her racing career, finishing third in the 1995 Santa Anita Oaks. Mari's Sheba also produced Sangaree, a half-brother to Congaree, who was sired by Awesome Again. She also produced Golden Sheba, a filly by Coronado's Quest, who went on to produce multiple Gr.I winning filly Wedding Toast.  Racing career  Trained by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Bob Baffert, Congaree won the April 2001 Wood Memorial Stakes over Monarchos, then finished third behind that rival in the Grade 1 Kentucky Derby while setting a record for the fastest opening mile in Derby history. He also finished third in the Preakness Stakes and did not compete in the 1¬Ω mile Belmont Stakes, opting instead to return to his California home base, where he won the Gr.1 Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park before returning East for a third- place finish in the Grade 1 Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga. Congaree went on to race very successfully at age four and five, becoming the first horse to win the Grade 1 Cigar Mile Handicap in consecutive years. His time for the 2002 Cigar Mile of 1:33.11 was the fastest mile run in North America in 2002. Starting in 22 consecutive graded stakes races, Congaree won ten graded stakes (including five Grade 1 races) and was an Eclipse Award finalist as Champion Sprinter, Champion Older Male and Horse of the Year. In 2004, ate age six, Congaree retired after finishing fourth in the Churchill Downs Handicap. He retired with a record of 25: 12-2-4 and earnings of $3,267,490.  Stud career  The stallion began his stud career stood in 2005 at Frank Stronach's Adena Springs in Midway, Kentucky. Adena Springs later moved operations to Paris, Kentucky, where Congaree stood through the 2009 breeding season. Beginning in 2010, Congaree stood at stud at Highcliff Farm in Delanson, New York. In 2013, Congaree was again moved to stand at Mill Creek Farm in New York, where he stayed until Lane's End Farm acquired him to stand at their Texas operation. When Lane's End Texas closed in 2017, Congaree was moved to stand at Valor Farm, also in Texas. He is still owned by Robert and Janice McNair, who bred and raced him in the name of their Stonerside Stable. After selling their Stonerside Stable property in Paris, Kentucky along with the majority of their bloodstock in October 2008, the McNairs began using the stable name Magnolia Racing Stable for their Thoroughbred holdings, which include Congaree, Cowboy Cal, Bob and John, and Stonesider.  Progeny  Congaree has met with success as a stallion, siring eight stakes winners from his first two crops to race, including multiple Gr.1 winner Jeranimo and multiple Gr. III winner Mythical Power. He has also found international success, siring Irish Gr.III winning mare Maoineach. Congaree's most notable progeny includes: * Jeranimo: Winner of the Shoemaker Mile Stakes, Eddie Read Handicap, San Gabriel Handicap (thrice), Oak Tree Mile Stakes, Strub Stakes, and Citation Handicap. * Don't Tell Sophia: Winner of the Spinster Stakes, Chilukki Stakes, Bayakoa Stakes (twice), Pippin Stakes (twice), and Locust Grove Stakes. * Killer Graces: Winner of the Hollywood Starlet Stakes, Landaluce Stakes, and Cinderella Stakes. * Shrinking Violet: Winner of the Monrovia Stakes, Daisycutter Handicap, and Licaghtning City Stakes. * Mythical Power: Winner of the Lone Star Derby and Texas Mile Stakes. * Maoineach: Winner of the One Thousand Guineas Trial Stakes (IRE-G3) and Go And Go Round Tower Stakes (IRE-G3) * Rockin' Rockstar: Winner of the Tom Ridge Stakes * Conchacer: Winner of the Forward Pass Stakes and Prairie Express Stakes.

The film also stars rapper Fredro Starr and features an early film appearance from Terrence Howard. It was produced by Perlman's husband, Danny DeVito. With elements of both drama and comedy, Sunset Park was released in April 1996 and went on to gross about $10 million at the box office. It didn't garner much attention from award ceremonies and was not nominated for any major movie award. The film was shot on location in New York City. Included in filming locations were various high schools and public buildings as well as the world-famous Madison Square Garden. The Sunset Park soundtrack featured one of the first solo appearances of Ghostface Killah. Plot Phyllis Saroka (Rhea Perlman) is a P.E. teacher at a school in New York City, who reads a flyer at her school that Sunset Park High School is looking for a new boys basketball coach. Looking for more money to pursue opening a restaurant on St. Croix, Virgin Islands, she decides to give the job a shot despite knowing nothing of basketball. She contacts the correct people and is given the job. She shows up for her first day on the job and the team is already skeptical of her. When she walks in, one player is heard saying \\"I know we gon' lose every game.\\" She then lets the players run the team, calling their own fouls, running their own plays, and basically allowing them to be carefree. During a game, she makes some bad decisions which irks some of the players on the team. This inspires her to learn more about the game with the assistance of her players. They help her and the team begins to slowly find success. The team also has to deal with outside forces that threaten the team. Tyrik \\"Shorty Doo-Wop\\" Russell (Fredro Starr) is on probation and eventually gets into more trouble. Spaceman (Terrence Howard) is also on probation, is constantly using drugs, and has trouble with a teacher. Busy-bee (De'aundre Bonds) is shot during the season and misses several games. Several other players are having academic trouble and some don't even get along with each other. The team members also find out that the coach only plans to stay with them one season and then leave to open a restaurant. The team eventually comes together despite their differences and troubles. They end up with very successful season, and get into the city championship. They go to Madison Square Garden to face their opponent and lose by a small margin. Afterward, the coach informs them that they should be proud of themselves and that she will return next season. Cast Phyllis Saroka (Rhea Perlman): A physical education coach who takes a job coaching boys basketball at Sunset Park. First, she takes the job to earn extra money for a year to open a restaurant but begins to become close to the team and eventually helps make them successful. She informs the team she will return next season after the city championships. Tariq \\"Shorty Doo-Wop\\" Russell (Fredro Starr): The leader of the Sunset Park team. He becomes the closest to the new coach and helps her out the most. He turns on her once he finds out about her restaurant plan and begins acting out, but comes back to lead the team. Spaceman (Terrence Howard): A care-free, weed smoking, quiet member of the team and a close friend of Shorty‚Äôs. He eventually becomes a key component of the team on the inside. He has conflict with a teacher as the film progresses, and his friendship with Shorty is tested when Shorty begins acting out. Mona (Carol Kane): Phyllis's best friend. She supports all of Phyllis's decisions and brags about her achievements to others. Barbara (Camille Saviola): A friend of Phyllis, a lawyer. At Phyllis's request, she defends Shorty when he gets into legal trouble. She gets very angry when she finds out Shorty actually committed the crime he was accused of and she got him off the charges. Busy- Bee (De'aundre Bonds): The undersized youngest player on the team. He is very supportive of the team and his teammates. He yearns to play but does not get very many chances to do so. He is shot while somebody tries to steal his coat. When he returns, he is given the chance to play and becomes successful. Butter (Talent Harris): The main post player on the team. He is a ladies man and is constantly bragging about how many women he has and has had in the past. Drano (Antwon Tanner): Drano is a guard who at first is scared to shoot the ball despite having good shooting skills. He is eventually given the confidence to shoot more and becomes a long-range threat for the team. He is also seen as the smart guy of the team because of his excellent school work. He is actually seen tutoring other team members. Boo Man (Guy Torry): A comedic character in the crowd during Sunset Park's games. He is constantly making fun of the players, their game, and the coach. Later in the film, however, he becomes more positive and supportive of the team. Mr. Santiago (John Vargas): The principal that acts as a minor antagonist to both the coach and the players.

A rich, beautiful, intelligent heiress of Belmont, she is bound by the lottery set forth in her father's will, which gives potential suitors the chance to choose among three caskets. If he chooses the right casket, he wins Portia's hand in marriage. If he chooses the incorrect casket, he must leave and never seek another woman in marriage. She is shown to think little of various foreign noblemen of similar rank who are most likely to seek her hand in marriage and still less of two suitors who seem to attempt her father's assigned task. Instead she favours a young but impoverished Venetian noble, Bassanio, who is also a soldier and a scholar. Bassanio goes on to choose the right casket. Portia is also fond of wordplay and proverbs, frequently quoting and coining them, which was considered a sign of wisdom and sharp wit in Elizabethan era. Some suggest that the character of Portia was based on Queen Elizabeth herself, who also had a penchant for proverbs.  Plot  Portia (1888) by Henry Woods Portia is beautiful, gracious, rich, intelligent and quick-witted, with high standards for her potential romantic partners. She is bound by the lottery set forth in her father's will, which gives potential suitors the chance to choose between three caskets composed of gold, silver and lead. If they choose the right casket ‚Äì the casket containing Portia's portrait and a scroll ‚Äì they win her hand in marriage. If they choose the incorrect casket, they must leave and never seek another woman in marriage. Portia is glad when two suitors, one driven by greed and another by vanity, fail to choose correctly, although she demonstrates tact to the Princes of Morocco and Arragon, who unsuccessfully seek her hand. She favours Bassanio, a young Venetian noble, but is not allowed to give him any clues to assist in his choice. Later in the play, she disguises herself as a man, then assumes the role of a lawyer's apprentice (named Balthazar) whereby she saves the life of Bassanio's friend, Antonio, in court. In the court scene, Portia finds a technicality in the bond, thereby outwitting the Jewish moneylender Shylock and saving Antonio's life from the pound of flesh demanded when everyone else including the Duke presiding as judge and Antonio himself fails. It is Portia who delivers one of the most famous speeches in The Merchant of Venice: Despite Portia's lack of formal legal training, she wins her case by referring to the details of the exact language of the law. Her success involves prevailing on technicalities rather than the merits of the situation. She uses the tactics of what is sometimes called a Philadelphia lawyer in modern times and in so doing demonstrates that she is far from powerless, irrespective of her earlier lack of choice in the marriage. However, the concept of rhetoric and its abuse is also brought to light by Portia ‚Äì highlighting the idea that an unjust argument may win through eloquence, loopholes and technicalities, regardless of the moral question at hand ‚Äì and thus provoking the audience to consider that issue. Shylock leaves the trial with both his life and his job intact but retains only half of his money and is deprived of his identity on being forced to convert to Christianity, while his daughter Jessica and her Christian husband Lorenzo with whom she had previously eloped are found in Portia's castle, not, it is implied, in complete happiness. Portia and Bassanio, on the other hand, continue to live together along with the former's lady-in-waiting Nerissa and her husband Gratiano.  Progenitor  Portia and Shylock, by Thomas Sully The original Portia Shakespeare drew from was Porcia Catonis, the wife of the Roman statesman Brutus, as well as several biblical allusions. She was also compared to the wife of Brutus within the play in Act 1 scene 1 when Bassanio talks to Antonio.  Portrayals  The strength of the role of Portia has made it attractive to many notable actresses. Frances Abington, Sarah Siddons and Elizabeth Whitlock all played Portia in the 18th century when actresses first started appearing on stage in performances of the play. More recently, the role has been depicted in the cinema and on television by a number of notable actresses such as Maggie Smith, Claire Bloom, Sybil Thorndike, Joan Plowright, Caroline John, Lynn Collins, and Gemma Jones.  Cultural references  The character of Portia has had a considerable and long-lived cultural impact. * Abigail Adams adopted the pen name \\"Portia\\" in letters to her husband, John Adams, the second president of the United States.

It is situated to the west of the B1248 road, and approximately north-east from the market town of Market Weighton and north-west from the market town of Beverley. Etton lies to the south-east. North Dalton is approximately north- west, with the villages of Middleton on the Wolds and Lund between. South Dalton forms part of the civil parish of Dalton Holme. The village forms part the Dalton Estate, owned and managed by the Hotham family which has possessed land in the area for generations. The 18th-century hall is the home of Lord Hotham. The Dalton Estate office is within the village. The Estate houses are of rows of cottages and Tudor style houses, some with date plates dating as far back as 1706. According to A Dictionary of British Place Names the village name derives from the Old English for a \\"farmstead or village in a valley.\\" South Dalton is listed in the Domesday Book as \\"Delton\\". At the time of the survey the settlement was in the Hundred of Sneculfcros in the East Riding of Yorkshire. It contained twelve households, twelve villagers, and six ploughlands. In 1066 Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, held the Lordship, this transferring by 1086 to the canons of Beverley, with Thomas of Bayeux, the later Archbishop of York, as Tenant-in-chief to King William I. By 1260 the settlement name was recorded as \\"Suthdalton\\".Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p. 146\\\\. In 1823 South Dalton was a village and civil parish in the Wapentake of Harthill. Population at the time was 277. Occupations included twelve farmers, a shopkeeper, a boot & shoe maker, a carpenter & wheelwright, a blacksmith, and the landlord of The Board public house. A weaver was also the parish clerk. Three carriers operated between the village and Beverley once a week.Baines, Edward (1823): History, Directory and Gazetteer of the County of York, p. 192 St Mary's Church The tomb of Sir John Hotham The church of St Mary was designated a Grade I listed building in 1968 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. Its spire is over tall and is a prominent local landmark. It was designed by John Loughborough Pearson and built from 1858-61 as a replacement for a brick structure. Inside the church lie a number of graves of the Hotham family; the older monuments were transferred from the earlier church. There is a black and white marble monument in memory of Sir John Hotham, 2nd Baronet which is based on the Cecil tomb at Hatfield and dates from after 1697.Nikolaus Pevsner & David Neave, (1972, 2nd Ed. 1995), Yorkshire: York and the East Riding: The Buildings of England, . Sir John is represented in life, as a reclining knight in full armour, with his helmet and gauntlet beside him, and in death, as a skeleton. Supporting the four corners of the tomb are statues representing the cardinal virtues. The organ is a three manual instrument by William Hill dating from 1877 with additions by the local Hull firm, Foster & Andrews, in 1897.

Members of the Organizaci√≥n Campesina de la Sierra Sur (South Mountain Range Farmer Organization) were en route to Atoyac de √Ålvarez to attend a protest march demanding the release of Gilberto Romero V√°zquez, a peasant activist arrested more than a month before (and who has never appeared since). They were also marching to demand drinking water, schools, hospitals and roads, among other things. According to survivors, they were ambushed by the motorized police and several were shot point blank. Some of the events were captured on film, by the police themselves. Weapons were subsequently placed in the dead farmers' hands and the police said they acted in self-defense. One of the results of this incident was the creation of the Popular Revolutionary Army, a leftist guerrilla organization. Planning of the massacre Allegedly, the ex-secretary general of Guerrero, Jos√© Rub√©n Robles Catal√°n, and Gustavo Olea Godoy, head of the state police, were waiting in a helicopter some meters away, and took off when the first shot was fired. The governor had before had a conversation with Mar√≠a de la Luz N√∫√±ez Ramos, saying measures had been taken so that the group would not reach Atoyac and that they would stop them by whatever means necessary. After the massacre he had another conversation with her, saying \\"They came for war, and war they got. Are we, or are we not the authority?\\", However, it is said to have been planned by the governor Rub√©n Figueroa Alcocer (PRI).

On the basis of the COBUILD and HECTOR research in corpus analysis, Hanks began to develop his theory of Norms and Exploitations. From 2001 to 2005, he was adjunct professor of computational lexicography at Brandeis University in Waltham, MA, where he worked closely with James Pustejovsky. In 2003, he was appointed consultant and visiting scientist to the Collocations Project and Electronic Dictionary of the German Language (DWDS) at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (BBAW) headed by Christiane Fellbaum. He has also served as a consultant on lexicographical methodology to the Institute of the Czech Language in Prague, to Patakis Publishers in Athens, and others. Patrick Hanks is author of many papers on lexical analysis, lexicography, onomastics,Many surnames began as insulting nicknames The Vancouver Sun, 9 October 2007 and similes and metaphor. He is editor in chief of the Dictionary of American Family NamesEskimo Kisses, Arm Hair, Moon Flags & Spike Lee vs. Stan Lee vs. Bruce Lee Esquire, 9 May 2007 (3 volumes, OUP 2003), and is co-author with Flavia Hodges and Kate Hardcastle of the Oxford Dictionary of First NamesWas Elvis Irish, Welsh, Scottish, German or What? (1990, 2006). He was section editor for lexicography in the second edition of the Elsevier Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics (ELL2; 2005), edited by Keith Brown, for which he commissioned survey articles on lexicography in all the world's major languages and on major issues in lexicography and lexicology. He edited a multivolume collection covering all aspects of lexicology for Routledge, and, with Rachel Giora, a companion collection covering all aspects of metaphor and figurative language. From 2005 to 2009 he was a senior research associate at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic, where he developed the empirical procedure of Corpus Pattern Analysis,Hanks, Patrick (2004) Corpus Pattern Analysis.

Published by Simon & Schuster in 1969, the book was a New York Times #1 best seller. Plot summary The Love Machine tells the story of ruthless, haunted Robin Stone and his life and career in the cut-throat world of 1960s network television. Handsome but promiscuous, the latter earning his nickname the Love Machine after he describes television with the same sobriquet, Robin is loved beyond all reason by three women: Amanda, the beautiful but doomed fashion model; Maggie, the beautiful but headstrong fellow journalist escaping a cruel society marriage; and Judith, the beautiful but aging wife of fourth-network founder Gregory Austin. As Robin rises and falls (both in and out of his bedroom), many people cross his path. They include Christie Lane, the vulgar but vulnerable comic/singer who becomes an unlikely TV variety star with an equally unlikely family-friendly image; Ethel Evans, the homely but athletic \\"celebrity fucker\\" who lusts for Robin but can't have him; Danton Miller, the dapper, desperate network executive who fears Robin and the exposure of his own private life; Austin, powerful and daring, but vulnerable in his own way; Sergio, the loving but pragmatic companion to Robin's mother, the beautiful but ailing Kitty; Lisa, Robin's suspicious sister; Ike Ryan, a producer who befriends but is befuddled by Robin; Dip Nelson, an actor-turned-producer whose loyalty to Robin is sorely tested; Alfie Knight, a too-clever-by-half actor and scene maker; Cliff Davies, a network lawyer who mistrusts Robin and has his own agenda; and various prostitutes---with one of whom an unexpected encounter forces Robin to face his past and, in time, his future---fading actors, psychotherapists, and the like. Background The title of the book refers not just to the character of Robin Stone, but to the television set itself.

As a political officer on secondment from the British Indian Army from 1876 to 1897 during the British Raj, he was attached to the Foreign Department of the Indian Government. His career in India was a mixture of military administrative business on the volatile North-West Frontier, and diplomacy and foreign politics advising Maharajas or accompanying the Viceroy in the Princely States. After leaving the Army, Evans Gordon returned to Britain and in 1900 was elected as Conservative Party MP for Stepney on an anti-alien platform. As a result of the pogroms in Eastern Europe, Jews were arriving in increasing numbers in Britain either to stay, or en route for America.

The rates are burdened with the education of thousands of foreign children.''Dispersing the Myths about Asylum' from the Socialist Review Evans-Gordon and the BBL were instrumental in setting up a Royal Commission on immigration of which he was a member. Over a two-month period Evans-Gordon travelled extensively in Eastern Europe, finding out at first hand about the highly restrictive conditions imposed on Jews in the Pale of Settlement and in Rumania. His itinerary took him to St Petersburg in Russia; Dvinsk, Riga, LiepƒÅja (Libau), Vilnius and Pinsk in Latvia; Warsaw, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Krak√≥w in Poland; Galicia (which belonged to Austria); Bucharest, Gala»õi (Galatz) and Lemberg in Rumania; and Berlin and boat from Hamburg. His book (with map) about his fact-finding mission, The Alien Immigrant is an even- handed account of his research. In the first chapter, it highlights the apparent concern of the British Board of Deputies for (and sometimes antipathy towards) the refugees from foreign shores. Although it contains some gratuitous low-level antisemitism, the book in general disinterestedly records the situation of the Jews, at one point favourably comparing conditions of the poor of Libau to the \\"horrors of the East End.\\" On the other hand, the conditions of hand-loom workers in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ moved him to this description: > The industry is carried on under appalling conditions. I shall never forget > the places in which I saw this work being done. It would need the pen of a > Zola to describe them. Three or four looms were crammed into one room with > as many families. I have never, even in Vilna or the East of London, seen > human beings condemned to live in such surroundings. They had the appearance > of half-starved consumptives. The last chapter contains examples of other unwelcome aliens, such as organised gangs of German robbers. The book was dedicated \\"To my friend Edward Steinkopff\\", who bought the deep blue St. James's Gazette in 1886. The St. James Gazette under its new owner may have been connected with the start of a new Anti-Alienism movement in the press in 1886.This is mentioned in passing in . The book was used in the evidence that he presented to the Aliens Commission in its inquiries. This eventually resulted in the Aliens Act 1905 which placed restrictions on Eastern European immigration, although discussion of the Bill in Parliament provoked considerable opposition. Winston Churchill was MP for Manchester North West, where one third of his constituents were Jewish. Like his father Lord Randolph Churchill, Churchill bucked the trend of widespread antisemitism in the British upper classes, and actively opposed the Aliens Bill. In an open letter to Nathan Laski{{cite news |ref= |title=Mr. Churchill And The Aliens Bill |newspaper=The Times |date=31 May 1904 |page=10 |url= (a prominent member of the Jewish community in his constituency and father of Harold Laski), Churchill quoted a speech by Lord Rothschild, a Liberal supporter and member of the Aliens Commission: > \\"The Bill introduced into the House of Commons proposes to establish in this > country a loathsome system of police interference and espionage, of > passports and arbitrary power exercised by police officers who in all > probability will not understand the language of those upon whom they are > called to sit in judgement. This is all contrary to the recommendations > proposed by the Royal Commission. [...] The whole bill looks like an attempt > on the part of the Government to gratify a small but noisy section of their > own supporters and to purchase a little popularity in the constituencies by > dealing harshly with a number of unfortunate aliens who have no votes.\\" A committed Zionist, Churchill crossed the floor of the House of Commons on the day the letter appeared.For more details of this period see WinstonChurchill.org and Despite the repeated denials of Arnold White and Evans-Gordon, anti-semitism was a central element of the campaign for the Aliens Bill 1900‚Äì1905. The indigent refugees from Russia, Rumania and Poland had further defenders in Parliament, such as Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet, Liberal MP for Elland who ‚Äì speaking against the Aliens Bill in 1904 ‚Äì said: Elland > \\"Among many people already ‚Äî not many in this House, but many people outside > of it ‚Äî there is a frankly anti-Semitic movement, and I deplore it. I > believe this is an evil step in the same direction as the Governments of > Russia and Rumania have been going. It may be that it is not intended, but > the action of many Members of this House has been calculated to excite the > feeling which we know to exist in part of our population, and with the case > of the persecution of Dreyfus reverberating through the West of Europe there > is no use saying that there is no danger of this kind in our own country. I > think it is a fortunate thing that we have been peculiarly free from any > anti-Semitic movement in England, and we have not lost by it.

It seems to me a useless and short-sighted, and at this > moment very largely an inhuman policy, to keep out those who may, after all, > be like those of whom I have just spoken.\\"HC Deb 25 April 1904 vol 133 > cc1062-131 In his 1905 election address, Evans-Gordon laid stress on the recently passed Aliens Act, which he had been greatly instrumental in carrying. He proceeds to explain his position with regard to the Jews. > \\"It has been falsely asserted that the Aliens Act is aimed against the > Jewish people, and that I have been actuated by anti-Semitism. I will not > stoop to repudiate such charges. No man views with greater horror and > indignation than I the recent barbarous and indescribable massacres of Jews > in Russia. But in expressing my deep sympathy with the victims of this most > terrible persecution I am bound to repeat my conviction that the solution of > the Jewish problem in Eastern Europe will not and cannot be found in the > transference of thousands of poverty-stricken and helpless aliens to the > most crowded quarters and overstocked markets of our greatest cities. It > will be found in the statesmanlike scheme of the Jewish Territorialist > Organization for the inauguration of which we are indebted to the genius and > patriotism of Mr. Israel Zangwill.\\" The Standard (London), 27 December 1905, > p. 6. The ITO came about through Zangwill's response to the Kishinev Pogrom. Vincent and Evans-Gordon successfully \\"stampeded their party into introducing laws to keep the foreigner out.\\" Although a section of the Conservative party had managed to persuade the Commons to pass anti-Jewish legislation, after only six months the Liberals had a landslide election victory in 1906. Although the Aliens Act was not repealed by the incoming Liberal government, the law was not strictly enforced. Evans Gordon held on to his seat amid the general Tory defeat, and continued to campaign for further anti-immigration legislation. In his successful bid for re-election in 1906, he spoke against the Sinti (German Gypsies) who were trying to settle in England; and, borrowing the slogan of the BBL, he campaigned with the slogan 'England for the English and Major Gordon for Stepney'. Despite this, Evans Gordon's anti- Semitism has been questioned as he was a supporter of Zionism and kept up regular correspondence with Chaim Weizmann who would later write of him: > I think our people were rather hard on him. The Aliens Bill in England and > the movement which grew around it were natural phenomenon which might have > been foreseen...Sir William Evans-Gordon had no particular anti-Jewish > prejudices...he was sincerely ready to encourage any settlement of Jews > almost anywhere in the British Empire but he failed to see why the ghettoes > of London or Leeds should be made into a branch of the ghettoes of Warsaw > and Pinsk [...] Sir William Evans-Gordon gave me some insight into the > psychology of the settled citizen. .

While billed as a Betty Boop cartoon, it was produced as a vehicle for Popeye the Sailor in his debut animated appearance.  Summary  The cartoon begins with stock film footage of newspapers rolling off a printing press. The front page of one of the newspapers appears, with a headline declaring that Popeye has become a movie star. The camera zooms in on the illustration of Popeye, which then comes to life, as Popeye (voiced by William \\"Billy\\" Costello) sings about his amazing prowess in his signature song \\"I'm Popeye the Sailor Man.\\"toontracker.com On land with his nemesis Bluto (voiced by William Pennell), the two sailors vie for the affections of Olive Oyl (voiced by Bonnie Poe). Popeye takes Olive Oyl to a carnival and pays the peacock 10¬¢ and Bluto blows off all of the peacock's feathers. They play two games, with Popeye \\"winning\\" both times and then they watch Betty Boop doing the hula. Popeye jumps up on stage, wraps the bearded lady's beard around his waist for a grass skirt, and dances with Betty, mimicking her movements. He is then bit by a snake, but then tranquilizes it with his pipe. Bluto then abducts Olive Oyl and ties her to a railroad track, using the track itself as \\"ropes\\", in order to cause a train wreck to kill Olive, where a train is approaching. Popeye fights Bluto, but initially loses, but then eats spinach and then punches Bluto, causing him to get trapped in a nailed coffin. He then punches the approaching engine and its baggage car and coaches in the \\"face\\", and wrecks the whole train in a crushing halt and sparing Olive's life, because of the can of spinach he ate. Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor performing a hula dance  Production notes  * This short also introduces the song \\"I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\\", written by Sammy Lerner, loosely based on the first two lines of the \\"Pirate King\\" song in Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta, The Pirates of Penzance. It would eventually become Popeye's theme song, with a portion of its instrumental appearing over the opening credits. For this cartoon, and at least one following it, the opening credits theme was an extended instrumental of \\"The Sailor's Hornpipe\\" (of which only the first bar was used in the later cartoons) followed by a vocal variation on \\"Strike Up the Band (Here Comes a Sailor)\\" substituting the words \\"for Popeye the Sailor\\" in the latter phrase. The song was sung twice in the opening credits of this cartoon, first by a deep-voiced singer who sounds like the Bluto voice, and then by Mae Questel (as the voice of Betty Boop). It was also heard in the science-fiction film Alien Resurrection (1997) when it is whistled by Dom Vriess. * The animation sequence with Popeye singing was reused in Let's Sing with Popeye. * The locomotive featured is a 2-4-2 (American type steam locomotive).

An example of this strategy is Dell Computers' build-to-order online store. One of the earliest references to the concept was in a paper by Zinn and Bowersox in the Journal of Business Logistics.Zinn, Walter and Donald J. Bowersox (1988), ‚ÄúPlanning Physical Distribution with the Principle of Postponement‚Äù, Journal of Business Logistics, 9 (2), 117-136 They highlighted five types: Labelling, Packaging, Assembly, Manufacturing and Time postponements. A successful example of postponement ‚Äì delayed differentiation ‚Äì is the use of ‚Äúvanilla boxes‚Äù. Semi-finished computers are stored in advance of seeing the actual demand for the finished products. Upon seeing the demand, thus with no residual uncertainty ‚Äì these ‚Äúvanilla boxes‚Äù are finished by adding (or removing) components. The three key interrelated decisions are: (a) how many different types of vanilla boxes to stock, (b) in what quantities, and (c) how to finish to meet the order most effectively. Postponement in Supply Chain Management Postponement is a concept in supply chain management where the manufacturer produces a generic product, which can be modified at the later stages before the final transport to the customer. Take for example an umbrella manufacturer who does not know what the demand will be for different colored umbrellas. The manufacturer will manufacture all white umbrellas and dye them later when umbrellas are in season and it is easier to predict demand of each color of umbrella. This way the manufacturer can stock up on white umbrellas early with minimal labor costs, and be sure of the demand before they dedicate time and money into predicting the demand so far in the future. Historical Development of Postponement Concept in Supply Chain Management Postponement has a rich history in terms of research conducted by hundreds of scientists. According to numerous logistics journals, Supply Chain Management books and articles, the postponement concept has three key dates in its development in the 20th century ‚Äì 1950, 1965 and 1988. Marketing theorist Alderson in 1950Alderson, W. (1950), ‚ÄúMarketing efficiency and the principle of postponement‚Äù, Cost and Profit Outlook, Vol. 3, pp. 15-18. was the first to create the concept of postponement. He stated that it could reduce costs from a marketing point of view by postponing to as late as possible the product differentiation. The theorist believes that the closer the product is to its consumer, the more differentiated it becomes due to changes in unique tastes and demands. In this situation, both the consumer and producer benefit, as there is less risk from uncertainty for a producer leaving the consumer satisfied with a product. After 15 years, professor Bucklin argued that Alderson‚Äôs interpretation needed modification, as it was still unclear how exactly postponement was applied on the channel level, namely, distribution. He explained that there is a shift of the risk to another partner in the supply chain due to postponement of the owned bunch of goods. This means that an institution involved in the chain, may it be a consumer, producer or the ones in between, have to bear the risk. In addition to this, Bucklin also claimed that inventories might be ineffective due to postponement, meaning there is no need to use forces for the stock.Bucklin, L.P. (1965), ‚ÄúPostponement, speculation and structure of distribution channels‚Äù, Journal of Marketing Research, Vol. 2, pp. 26-31.. To solve the problem Bucklin developed ¬±the speculation concept for the aim of creating the speculation-postponement strategy. Speculation allowed for orders of large quantities of goods, which already cuts the costs in transportation and sorting. These goods are then placed into speculative inventories and emptied according to the orders. The ideal strategy would be to either use speculation or postponement in the distribution channel depending on competition and potential risk savings. Zinn and Bowersox in 1988 split up postponement into five different types to improve the distribution systems: four form postponements (labeling, packaging, assembly, manufacturing) and time postponement. These strategies were created with the aim to save costs, and therefore Zinn and Bowersox (1988) created a useful cost-model to see how postponement affects each strategy with regards to costsZinn, W. and Bowersox, D. (1988), ‚ÄúPlanning physical distribution with the principle of postponement‚Äù, Journal of Business Logistics, Vol. 9 No. 2, p. 117 After the development of postponement concept in the 20th century, researchers started defining postponement differently today and there are two key developments in 2001 and 2004. Van Hoek in 2001 claimed that it is important to analyze postponement not just on the marketing and distribution channel levels but also on the supply chain level. He argued that previous theories developed in the 20th century had gaps in their research of postponement, and, therefore, Van Hoek identified 5 challenges: 1. Postponement as a supply chain concept, 2. Integrating related supply chain concepts, 3. Postponement in the globalizing supply chain, 4. Postponement in the customized supply chain, 5. Methodological upgrading of postponement.Van Hoek, R.I. (2001), ‚ÄúThe rediscovery of postponement a literature review and directions for research‚Äù, Journal of Operations Management, Vol. 19 No. 2, pp. 161-84. In the first challenge, he criticised Bucklin‚Äôs and Zinn‚Äôs postponement theories as they lacked postponement application throughout the whole supply chain, since they only linked their theories to one of its levels (upstream ‚Äì sourcing & components, midstream - manufacturing, downstream - distribution). Professor Van Hoek states that ‚ÄúSpecific study should be undertaken to assess what extent postponement is applied at various positions in the supply chain‚Äù. The second challenge states that to cover the entire supply chain in conceptualization of postponement, a researcher would need to engage related concepts, e.g. just-in-time manufacturing and supply, efficient consumer response. Globalization in postponement comes as the third challenge. He states that there are differences in language, culture across the world and that postponement is widely present in Western countries rather than emerging countries in Asia. Therefore, Van Hoek advises to analyse these geographical dimensions when conducting a research on postponement. The fourth challenge discusses lack of typology in postponement. Researches should not only pay attention to manufacturing and logistics related postponement but also to service postponement, since the concept takes its place in services too. Finally, the fifth challenge tells that in order to conduct a solid research plan on postponement one should consider the triangulation model with first step ‚Äì how postponement is implemented in a global supply chain, second step ‚Äì where, to what extent and how postponement is applied, third step ‚Äì benefits of postponement in the customized supply chain. It should be stated that Van Hoek has made a solid contribution into postponement concept development as he provided these 5 challenges, and raised interest on postponement, i.e. there has been more literature on postponement available.Boone C.A., Craighead C.W., Hanna J.B. (2007), ‚ÄúPostponement: an evolving supply chain concept‚Äù, International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, Vol. 37 Iss 8 pp. 594 ‚Äì 611 Yang et al. could be one of the main examples of advanced postponement literature, as it grouped the postponement strategies in 2004 from Zinn and Bowersox (1988) into more accurate groups and explains how exactly the strategy is matched to a type of postponement.Yang, B., Burns, N. and Backhouse, C. (2004), ‚ÄúManagement of uncertainty through postponement‚Äù, International Journal of Production Research, Vol. 42 No. 6, pp. 1049-64.. Yang et al. stated that in order to cope with high level of uncertainty, purchasing postponement (purchasing materials as close to production as possible) product development postponement may be applied => no physical inventory. In contrast, to deal with low uncertainty we use logistics postponement (reduction of obsolete inventories, just-in-time delivery) and production postponement => semi-finished product. With high modularity (when components can be incorporated into products with almost no change) product development and production postponements are used, whereas with low modularity (when customization is required) ‚Äì logistics and purchasing postponements. This is what exactly was lacking in the 20th century because you did not know whether physical inventory, semi-finished, or finished products would work best as it was uncertain due to fluctuating consumer demands. Therefore, Yang et al. (2004) provides us with a guideline on how to manage this uncertainty. To conclude, the 21st century has enhanced the postponement concept in terms of definition, aspects and strategies. One of the most modern definitions today is the following, suggested by Christopher (2005): ‚ÄúPostponement refers to the process by which the commitment of a product to its final form or location is delayed for as long as possible‚Äù.Christopher, M. (2005), ‚ÄúLogistics and supply chain management: creating value-adding networks‚Äù, Prentice Hall, London.  Literature  *Swaminathan, J.M., & Lee, H.L. (2003). Design for Postponement.

Uses In computer science Metacomputing, as a computing of computing, includes: the organization of large computer networks, choice of the design criteria (for example: peer-to-peer or centralized solution) and metacomputing software (middleware, metaprogramming) development where, in the specific domains, the concept metacomputing is used as a description of software meta- layers which are networked platforms for the development of user-oriented calculations, for example for computational physics and bio-informatics. Here, serious scientific problems of systems/networks complexity emerge, not only related to domain-dependent complexities but focused on systemic meta- complexity of computer network infrastructures. Metacomputing is also a useful descriptor for self-referential programming systems. Often these systems are functional as fifth-generation computer languages which require the use of an underlying metaprocessor software operating system in order to be operative. Typically metacomputing occurs in an interpreted or real-time compiling system since the changing nature of information in processing results may result in an unpredictable compute state throughout the existence of the metacomputer (the information state operated upon by the metacomputing platform). In socio-cognitive engineering From the human and social perspectives, metacomputing is especially focused on: human-computer software, cognitive interrelations/interfaces, the possibilities of the development of intelligent computer grids for the cooperation of human organizations, and on ubiquitous computing technologies. In particular, it relates to the development of software infrastructures for the computational modeling and simulation of cognitive architectures for various decision support systems. In systemics and from philosophical perspective Metacomputing refers to the general problems of computationality of human knowledge, to the limits of the transformation of human knowledge and individual thinking to the form of computer programs.

A day earlier, settlers at Painted Stone Station, established by Squire Boone, had learned that the fort was about to be raided by a large Indian war party under the command of Loyalist captain Alexander McKee.Akers, Vincent J. History of Painted Stone Station , Painted Stone Settlers Organization, 2012, accessdate 28 December 2012. Most chose to abandon that station for the better manned ones near Beargrass Creek, and had left the injured Boone and one other family behind. Some settlers hesitated for two days before moving toward Linn's Station.Kleber, John E., editor. The Long Run Massacre, The Kentucky Encyclopedia. University Press of Kentucky, 1992 Following the loss of part of their military guard, the party was ambushed at thirteen-mile tree, from Linn's Station. At least seven settlers were killed; Indian losses are unknown. The survivors fled and reached Linn's Station by nightfall. Despite historical markers and at least one published report indicating that at least 60 people were killed and only a few escaped,Ciore, Lou Catherine, \\"Long Run Massacre, Register 10 (January 1912): 75-6. only about 15 settlers were actually killed, followed by 17 soldiers under Colonel John Floyd who were attacked the following day when they went to bury their remains.Wilcox, G.T., An account of the Long Run Massacre and Floyd's Defeat as told by G.

He had offices at the Gaiety Theatre office building in Times Square.Bloom, Ken, Broadway: An Encyclopedia, Routledge; 2nd edition (November 11, 2003), . Early life Vodery was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 8, 1885; his mother was a pianist and his father was a teacher at Lincoln University. From an early age Vodery's family rented rooms to theatrical performers, exposing Will to many talented black performers at the turn of the 20th century, including members of the Williams & Walker Co. He attended the University of Pennsylvania on scholarship, where he studied with Hugh A. Clark.Peterson, Bernard L. \\"Will Vodery.\\" The American Mosaic: The African American Experience. ABC-CLIO, 2015. Web. September 23, 2015. Career Beginning in 1910 Vodery served as the musical director for performances at the Howard Theater in Washington, D.C., until 1911. During this time, he co-wrote music and lyrics for J. Leubrie Hill's My Friend from Dixie. This show was subsequently revised and expanded into the Darktown Follies. Darktown Follies became one of the landmark shows at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem. While Vodery did compose the music for the show From Dixie to Broadway (1924), he is most famous for the vocal and choral arrangements that he created for the original Broadway stage production of the classic musical Show Boat (1927). His arrangements for the show were used again in the London production of the show (1928), and the first revival on Broadway (1932), as well as in both the Universal Pictures film version (1936), and the prologue to the part-talkie 1929 film version (also by Universal) of Edna Ferber's novel, on which the show is based. Vodery's original arrangements were combined with new ones by Pembroke Davenport for the 1946 Broadway revival of Show Boat. Vodery also created the vocal arrangements for several editions of the Ziegfeld Follies. He also orchestrated George Gershwin's one- act opera Blue Monday. With Will Marion Cook, he wrote the show Swing Along (1929). Vodery was an important influence on Duke Ellington. Also in 1929, Vodery, in his capacity as Ziegfeld's musical supervisor, recommended Ellington for Show Girl. According to author John Hasse, \\"Perhaps during the run of Show Girl, Ellington received what he later termed 'valuable lessons in orchestration from Will Vodery.'\\" Author Barry Ulanov wrote of this relationship: \\"From Vodery, as he (Ellington) says himself, he drew his chromatic convictions, his uses of the tones ordinarily extraneous to the diatonic scale, with the consequent alteration of the harmonic character of his music, its broadening, The deepening of his resources. It has become customary to ascribe the classical influences upon Duke ‚Äì Delius, Debussy and Ravel ‚Äì to direct contact with their music. Actually his serious appreciation of those and other modern composers, came after his meeting with Vodery.\\" From 1929 to 1932 Vodery was arranger and musical director for Fox Films in Hollywood. Following his time at Fox, Vodery moved back to New York City, where he continued to arrange music for such shows as Shuffle Along of 1933 and several editions of Leonard Harper's revues at the Cotton Club, a cultural landmark located in Harlem. In 1942 he was musical director for Ed Sullivan's Harlem Cavalcade. Despite his success and popularity at the time, Vodery is largely unknown today, partly because he received no screen credit in the 1936 film version of Show Boat, and partly because some modern productions of the show do not use his arrangements. He died on November 18, 1951, only four months after Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1951 Technicolor film version of Show Boat, on which he did not work, had been released.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Lemnos, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior It covers the west coast of the island, and has a land area of , about 17.2% of the island's area. Its municipal seat was the town of M√Ωrina (pop. 5,107 at the 2001 census), located in the middle of the island's west coast. The town is also the capital of Lemnos, as well as the seat of the Metropolitan (Greek Orthodox bishop) of Lemnos. In addition to the town of Myrina, the municipal unit includes the communities of K√°spakas (792), Plat√Ω (785), Th√°nos (451), and Korn√≥s (267). The 2011 census recorded 5,711 residents in the town and 8,006 residents in the municipal unit. The municipal unit's economically active population in 2001 was 3,007. Of them, 14.5% were employers, 12% self-employed, 65.4% wage-earners, 4.1% unpaid, auxiliary family members, and 4% did not declare line of occupation. Of the economically active population, 6.7% worked in agriculture, 4% in light manufacturing, 12.3% in construction, 8.5% in hotels & restaurants, and the rest in other lines of business (source: 2001 Census, National Statistical Service of Greece).  Climate  The climate in Lemnos is mainly Mediterranean. Winters are generally mild, but there will be a snowfall occasionally. Strong winds are a feature of the island, especially in August and in winter time, hence its nickname \\"the wind-ridden one\\" (in Greek, ŒëŒΩŒµŒºœåŒµœÉœÉŒ±). The temperature is typically 2 to 5 degrees Celsius less than in Athens, especially in summertime. History According to Herodotus, when the Chersonese on the Hellespont came under Athens' rule, Miltiades the son of Cimon came from Elaeus on the Chersonese to Lemnos where he proclaimed the Pelasgians must submit. The Hephaestians obeyed, giving up their city, but the Myrinaeans from the city Myrina would not be as easily pursued until they too submitted to Athens, thus given control of the island to Miltiades and the Athenians. (Herodotus: The Histories (ed. A. D. Godley, 1920), Cambridge. Harvard University Press. Cited February 2004 from The Perseus Project) The ancient town also garnered notice of Pliny the Elder who wrote that the shadow of Mount Athos could be seen in the town's forum on the summer solstice. Other authors of antiquity who note the town include Ptolemy and Stephanus of Byzantium.  The town of Myrina  View of the town's beach The castle at night Modern day Myrina is built upon a shallow bay split into two by a promontory jutting out to sea and carrying the ruins of a Venetian castle. To the north of the promontory lies the so-called Roman Shore (in Greek, Œ°œâŒºŒ≠œäŒ∫ŒøœÇ ŒÑŒìŒπŒ±ŒªœåœÇ), along which the Greek community had their homes during Ottoman times (prior to 1913, when Greek admiral Kountouriotis defeated the Turks and annexed Lemnos and Myrina to Greece). The name \\"Roman\\" dates to the Byzantine Empire, when Greeks were called Romans (Œ°œâŒºŒπŒøŒØ). To the south of the promontory lies the Turkish Shore (in Greek, Œ§ŒøœçœÅŒ∫ŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ ŒÑŒìŒπŒ±ŒªœåœÇ), along which the Turkish community similarly had their homes, before the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey. In 2001 the town had 3,022 regular dwellings, of which 30.4% were stone-built, and 75.6% had pitched roofs made of red tiles (source: 18.3.2001 Census, National Statistical Service of Greece).  Town quarters  Panoramic view of the town Behind the fronts of the two Shores, the town is divided into 4 parts: the old town core (encompassing the aforementioned Shores), referred to as Kastro (after the Castle atop the promontory); Androni, to the north (where the women of prehistoric Lemnos are said to have drugged their men before tossing them from the cliff of Petasos (the north horn of the bay of Myrina)); Tchas (most probably from the Russian word —á–∞—Å–æ–≤–æ–π, which means sentinel, sentry, or guard, because there was a Russian garrison stationed there for a short time at the end of the 18th century; less probably from the Russian word —á–∞—Å, which means hour), just behind the harbour area; and Nea Madetos, a new (post-1980) settlement of workers¬¥and fishermen's houses on the hill overlooking the Turkish shore from the south. The heart of the town is the market street, running north to south, and joining the Roman Shore to the Turkish Shore. Other landmarks are the OTE (Hellenic Telecoms Organisation) square, also called the bank square because it is the hub of all bank branches of the island, halfway along the market street, and the Perivola square, behind the Roman Shore, where the Lemnos bus station is (providing bus service from Myrina to the villages and back). The Town Hall building is located in the harbour, near the Port Authority building. Myrina also boasts a good provincial hospital, in the Tchas quarter, while presently is in the process of modernising its sewage system.  Town features  Town hall Archaeological museum of Lemnos. Many of the town's streets are stone-paved alleys. The Roman Shore in particular is quite beautiful, aligned as it is with stone-built houses of neoclassical design (built from the mid-19th to the early 20th century), where the island's rich Greeks lived (many of the houses are still occupied by the descendants of those Greeks, most of whom made their fortunes as businessmen in British Egypt, part of the Greek diaspora there). The archaeological museum displays numerous exhibits from the island's remote (mostly prehistoric) past. With its clean, long, and sandy beaches, and its own Castle to boot, Myrina is a tourist attraction. Visitors and locals like bathing in the Roman Shore (or the Shallow Waters (in Greek, Œ°Œ∑œáŒ¨ ŒùŒµœÅŒ¨) beach, adjacent to the Roman Shore on the north), and having dinner at one of the fish taverns circling the traditional harbour in the Turkish Shore, enjoying the caiques there and a view of the castle at night. During the summer Myrina holds various outside theatrical and musical events.

During his year in office, Drusus proposed wide-ranging legislative reforms, including offering the citizenship to Rome's Italian allies. The failure of these reforms, and Drusus' subsequent murder at the hands of an unknown assassin in late 91 BC, are often seen as an immediate cause of the Social War.e.g. Velleius Paterculus, 2.13-15: 'with the death of Drusus, the long-burgeoning Italian War broke out'  Early Life  Marcus Livius Drusus was born in ca. 124 BC.G.V. Sumner, The Orators in Cicero's Brutus (Toronto, 1973), p. 111 He was the son of Cornelia (whose precise identity is unknown) and Marcus Livius Drusus the Elder, a distinguished statesman who had served all the major magistracies of the cursus honorum as tribune in 122 BC, consul in 112 BC, and censor in 109 BC. Drusus the Elder died in 108 BC: if the younger Marcus was the eldest son, he would now have become the pater familias of the Drusi and the provider for his two siblings, Mamercus and Livia. However, certain scholars believe that Mamercus was in fact the eldest son, Marcus one or two years his junior.E.g. Sumner, The Orators in Cicero's Brutus, pp. 64-6, 110-1K. Zmeskal, adfinitas: Die Verwandtschaften der senatorischen F√ºhrungsschicht der r√∂mischen Republik von 218 ‚Äì 31 v.Chr. (Passau, 2009), vol. 1, p. 171 Cicero reports that Drusus was a principled and conscientious youth.Cicero, De Officiis 1.30 When serving as quaestor in Asia Minor, he conspicuously refused to wear his official insignia as a sign of respect.Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66 After the death of his father, Drusus inherited vast amounts of wealth, with which he paid for grand gladiatorial shows during his aedileship. His generosity was famous in antiquity: he once commented that he spent so much money on other people that he had 'nothing left to give away to anybody but mud and air'.Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66 Drusus also built a grand new house on the Palatine Hill, telling the architect to build it so that all his fellow- citizens could see everything he did. This famous house was later owned by Cicero, Censorinus, and Rutilius Sisenna.Velleius Paterculus 2.14  Reforms as tribune   Senatorial support  Drusus was elected tribune of the Plebs for 91 BC. Hostile propaganda later portrayed him as a demagogue from the outset of his tribunate, but Cicero and others assert that he began with the aim of strengthening senatorial rule and had the backing of the most powerful optimates in the Senate.Cicero, De Officiis 1.108Florus 2.5.1‚Äì3 These included the 'father of the senate' (princeps senatus), Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, who had been the colleague of Drusus' father in the censorship of 109 BC; and Lucius Licinius Crassus, the most influential orator of the day.Cicero, De Oratore 3.2-6 In pursuing a 'conservative' tribunate, Drusus was following in the footsteps of his father who, as tribune in 122 BC, had successfully championed the Senate's interests against the famous popularis reformer Gaius Gracchus.Plutarch, Life of C. Gracchus 8.2-12.3  The Quaestio de Repetundis   History of the Equestrian Courts  The most important issue which Drusus and his backers sought to address concerned the composition of juries at trials for extortion.Th. Mommsen, The History of Rome, Vol. 3, p. 484 In 122 BC, Gaius Gracchus had made the juries for these courts (Latin, quaestio de repetundis) composed entirely of wealthy equites instead of senators.Cicero, First Verrine 38Velleius Paterculus 2.13.2, 2.32.3 This gave the equestrians great judicial power, a fact resented by many senators, many of whom found the loss of their forensic role humiliating.C. Steel, The End of the Roman Republic (Edinburgh: 2013), p.37 In 106 BC, Quintus Servilius Caepio had attempted to end the equestrian monopoly on juries by proposing a law to introduce mixed senatorial-equestrian juries. However, despite the famous support of Lucius Crassus, this Lex Servilia was replaced after only two years by a law of Gaius Servilius Glaucia which restored the equestrian monopoly.Cicero, Brutus 164 Over time, the equestrian jurors proved reluctant to give guilty verdicts. Of the many political prosecutions in the years 99-92 BC, not a single individual was condemned under their courts; this created great frustration in the Senate, as it paralysed one of the main avenues of political rivalry.E.S. Gruen, 'Political Prosecutions in the 90s BC', Historia 15 (1966), p. 60 As a result, a growing number of eminent senators came to believe that the equestrian monopoly had to be ended. This resentment was intensified by the prosecution and exile of the esteemed consularis Publius Rutilius Rufus in ca. 92 BC. Rutilius Rufus had served as legatus to Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex during the latter's governorship in Asia. They had famously opposed the rapacity of the equestrian businessmen operating in the province, gaining much praise from the provincials and the Senate but hostility from the equites.Diodorus Siculus, 37.5.1-4 In retaliation, the equestrians brought about Rufus' prosecution in one of their own courts when he returned to Rome. Although Rufus was likely innocent, the jury nonetheless found him guilty, and he was sent into exile to Smyrna. The injustice of the affair was compounded by Rutilius Rufus' calm, Stoical acceptance of his fate, and his case was long a byword for unjust sentences.Livy, Epitome of Book 70Florus, Epitome of Roman History 2.5 Since Rutilius Rufus was one of Drusus' uncles, his scandalous exile likely provided the immediate incentive for Drusus' reforms.E. Gabba, Republican Rome, the Army, and the Allies (Berkley: 1976), p. 132  Drusus' reform  The exact form of Drusus' solution to this problem is unclear. Appian says that Drusus proposed to include 300 new equites into the Senate, and that the jurors would henceforth be drawn from the enlarged pool of senators.Appian, Civil Wars 1.35 However, Livy states that Drusus introduced juries comprising a mix of senators and equites, with no enlargement of the Senate.Livy, Epitome of Book 71 Since Appian is notoriously unreliable for this period, some scholars believe Appian has conflated Drusus' proposal with the actual expansion of the Senate that took place ten years later under Sulla's regime.Steel, The End of the Roman Republic, p.38  Supplementary legislation  In order to gain popular support for his jury law, Drusus put forward a number of supplementary bills. To gain support from the plebeians, he passed a land law, which seems to have proposed the redistribution of public land (Ager publicus) to the poor as well as the creation of new colonies in Italy and Sicily.Appian, Civil Wars 1.35-6 He then assigned himself a place on the board of ten commissioners tasked with carrying out the redistributions.Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae 49 To attract further support, Drusus may also have passed a law reducing the price of grain.Livy, Epitome of Book 71 Alongside these popularist bills, Drusus passed a law making the equestrians liable to prosecution for bribery.Cicero, Pro Cluentio 153 He may also have deliberately debased the coinage by adding one-eighth of bronze to the silver coins, perhaps in order to help pay for his agrarian redistributions.Pliny the Elder, Natural History 33.3.46 All these bills were likely passed in the early months of 91 BC.Steel, The End of the Roman Republic, p. 39  Opposition to legislation   Senatorial opposition  Despite support from notable backers, Drusus' legislation attracted powerful opposition, including the consul Lucius Marcius Philippus. Also among Drusus' opponents was the praetor Servilius Caepio, his former brother-in-law. On the day of voting, Philippus tried to stop proceedings, and was only deterred when one of Drusus' supporters throttled the consul to the point that he started bleeding.Florus, 2.5Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66.9 When Caepio continued to oppose the legislation, Drusus threatened to have the praetor hurled from the Tarpeian Rock, an archaic punishment for treasonable magistrates.Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66.8 Eventually, Drusus passed his legislation by combining all the various bills into one law ‚Äì a practice that had been banned several years previously under the terms of the Lex Caecilia Didia.Th. Mommsen, The History of Rome, Vol. 3, p. 487 By September, momentum was turning against Drusus and his backers.Appian, Civil Wars 1.35-6Valerius Maximus 9.5.2 Senators in the Roman Republic were deeply wary of any one individual gaining extraordinary personal power; as a result, Drusus' popularity with the people lost him support in the Senate, where it was feared he was becoming dangerously influential in the model of the Gracchi or Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.E. Gabba, 'Rome and Italy: The Social War', in The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume IX: The Last Age of the Roman Republic, 146-43 BC, p. 113 The consul Philippus called for the abrogation of Drusus' laws,Cicero, De Oratore 1.24-6, 3.1-6 and a heated exchange took place on 13 September in the Senate House between Philippus and Lucius Crassus. Philippus claimed he could no longer work with the current Senate, to which Crassus retorted by calling Philippus' status as consul into question, remarking 'Should I consider you a consul, when you don't think that I am a senator?'Quintilian, Inst. 8.3.89 However, this was to be Crassus' 'last swan- song', in Cicero's words, as he suddenly died a week later.Cicero, De Oratore 3.2-6  Italian proposal and abrogation of the laws  With Crassus dead, Drusus was robbed of one of his most influential backers.C.F. Konrad, 'From the Gracchi to the First Civil War', in A Companion to the Roman Republic (Blackwell, 2006) Now, late in 91 BC, he turned towards soliciting support from the Italian allies.Steel, The End of the Roman Republic, p. 40e.g. Velleius Paterculus, 2.14: 'since his excellent programme had fared so badly, Drusus turned his attention to granting the citizenship to the Italians'Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66.10 It seems Drusus already had close contacts among the Italians, as the important Marsic aristocrat Quintus Poppaedius Silo, who would later serve as the main Italian commander in the Social War, was a regular guest at his house.Plutarch, Life of Cato the Younger 2 However, Drusus' proposal attracted more opposition, as many senators feared the personal power Drusus would gain from mass enfranchisement. Rumours apparently circulated that the Italians had sworn a sacred oath pledging allegiance to Drusus alone, a version of which is preserved in Diodorus Siculus:Diodorus Siculus, 37.11 > 'I swear by Jupiter Capitolinus, by Vesta of Rome, by Mars her ancestral > god, by Sol the founder of the race, and by Terra the benefactress of > animals and plants, likewise by the demigods who founded Rome and by the > heroes who have contributed to increase her empire, that I will count the > friend and foe of Drusus my friend and foe, and that I will spare neither > property nor the lives of my children or parents except as it be to the > advantage of Drusus and of those who have taken this oath. If I become a > citizen by the law of Drusus, I shall consider Rome my country and Drusus my > greatest benefactor.' It was also around this point that Drusus apparently suffered a minor breakdown or epileptic fit, prompting a flood of supportive messages from the Italian towns.Pliny the Elder, Natural History 17.15.6, 25.52Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66.11R. Evans, Questioning Reputations (Pretoria, 2003), pp.154‚Äì6 Seeing the opposition in Rome to the bill, some of the Italians grew increasingly agitated. Diodorus Siculus reports that Quintus Poppaedius Silo led 10,000 allies in a protest march on Rome,Diodorus Siculus, 37.13 while Florus remarks that Drusus' public meetings attracted such huge crowds that it seemed as though all of Rome were under siege.Florus, 2.5.7 Eventually, a plot was hatched by the Italians to assassinate the consuls on the Alban Mount. This was only foiled when Drusus himself caught wind of it and warned Philippus.Florus, Epitome of Roman History 2.6.8Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66.12 The Italians also began secret preparations for an armed conflict, including trading hostages and gathering weapons.E. Gabba, Rome and Italy: The Social War, CAH IX (1994), p. 114 In this tense climate of political disputes, alleged assassination plots, and Italian discontent, Philippus finally succeeded in persuading the Senate to abolish all of Drusus' legislation. The justification was twofold: firstly, that the laws had been passed in contravention of the sacred auspices, meaning they were contrary to the will of the gods;Asconius 68-69C, commenting on Cicero's Pro Cornelio and secondly, that they had contravened the Lex Caecilia Didia of 98 BC.Cicero, De Domo 41  Assassination  Though he publicly denounced the senatorial decree, Drusus did not attempt to use his veto to oppose it.Diodorus Siculus 37.10 He was already being prosecuted for his alleged involvement in the Alban Mount plot,Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66.12 and seems to have recognised that opposition was futile. It was at this point, sometime in the autumn of 91 BC, that Drusus was assassinated by an unknown killer.Date: E. Gabba, 'Rome and Italy: The Social War', in CAH IX (1994), p. 113 According to some ancient sources, the murder took place inside the atrium of Drusus' own house.Appian, Civil Wars 1.36Velleius Paterculus 2.13 Other sources say he was stabbed whilst walking back from the Forum.Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66.12Seneca the Younger, De Brevitate Vitae 6.1-2 Philippus and Caepio were blamed by some for the assassination,Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus 66.13 as was Quintus Varius Hybrida, the tribune of 90 BC who later created a special court to prosecute Drusus' supporters.Cicero, De Natura Deorum 3.81F.C. Tweedie, 'Caenum aut caelum: M. Livius Drusus and the Land', Mnemosyne Vol. 64 (2011), p. 588  Legacy  Since the Social War (91-88 BC) began almost immediately after his assassination, many Romans blamed Drusus for the war: > Accordingly when the citizenship promised to the allies was not forthcoming, > the Italians in their anger began to plot revolt ... Marcus Livius Drusus, > of whom even the Senate had come to disapprove, was the author of the Social > War, and was as a result killed at his home; no-one knows by whom.Livy, > Epitome of Book 70 After Drusus' murder, a special court was set up under the Lex Varia to prosecute those who, like Drusus, were suspected of encouraging the Italians to revolt.Appian, Civil Wars 1.37 Drusus' friend Gaius Aurelius Cotta was among the exiled, while his mentor Marcus Scaurus, the princeps senatus, was also accused. In the longer term, later generations of Roman historians considered Drusus' tribunate a critical milestone in the Crisis of the Roman Republic. Appian, Livy, and Florus all placed Drusus' \\"seditio\\" within a clear sequence of similar disorders. In their analysis, he followed the examples of the Gracchi and of Saturninus, and was succeeded by the sedition of Gaius Marius and Publius Sulpicius Rufus.Appian, Civil WarsLivy, Epitome of Book 70Florus, Epitome of the History of Rome Thus Drusus' original position as champion of the Senate was forgotten by these authors, who instead emphasised the turbulence of his tribunate and his role in the start of the Social War. Though accepting that his promises to the Italians in the year 91 BC directly precipitated the outbreak of the Social War, many modern scholars are more forgiving of Drusus.C.F. Conrad, 'From the Gracchi to the First Civil War', in A Companion to the Roman Republic (Blackwell, 2006), p. 177J√ºrgen von Ungern- Sternberg, 'The Crisis of the Republic', in The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic (Cambridge: 2004), pp. 96-7 Theodore Mommsen considered him a genuine reformer, a progressive who attempted to resolve some of the most pressing issues of the day in an age when few others were willing to do likewise.Th. Mommsen, The History of Rome, Vol. 3, p. 483, 489. In the judgement of the Italian scholar Emilio Gabba:E. Gabba, Republican Rome, the Army, and the Allies (Berkley: 1976), p. 131 > Drusus' complex scheme seems to be directed by a precise and shrewd > awareness of the historical situation, the political forces at work, and the > needs and interests which these forces represented and conveyed. It reveals > a political capacity which matched that of Gaius Gracchus.  Family  Drusus had several distinguished descendants. Through his adopted son, he became an ancestor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty; and through the two marriages of his sister, Livia, he was uncle to Cato the Younger and great- uncle to Marcus Junius Brutus. His brother, Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus (who was adopted into the Aemilii Lepidi), also served as consul in 77 BC.  Imperial descendants  At some point ca. 100 BC, Drusus married Servilia, a sister of his friend Quintus Servilius Caepio. However, they appear to have divorced sometime around the year 97 BC without having any known children. It seems that Drusus did not marry again before his death in 91 BC.E. Gabba, Republican Rome, the Army, and the Allies (Berkley: 1976), p. 134 However, Drusus did adopt Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus, born Appius Claudius Pulcher. This adopted son married Alfidia, with whom he had a daughter named Livia. This Livia was the famous Empress, the wife to the emperor Augustus and mother of the second emperor Tiberius. Therefore, through the adoption of his son, Marcus Livius Drusus and his family (the Drusi) became eventual ancestors to the imperial Julio-Claudian dynasty.  Nieces and nephews  Drusus had a sister, Livia, whom he married to his friend and brother-in-law Quintus Servilius Caepio. Livia and Caepio had three children: the famous Servilia, who was sequentially the mistress of Julius Caesar and the mother of Marcus Junius Brutus; another Servilia, who married the general Lucullus; and a son, also called Gnaeus Servilius Caepio. However, Drusus and Caepio fell out, allegedly over the sale of a ring at an auction, and subsequently they became personal enemies.Pliny the Elder, Natural History 33.20 As a result, Drusus divorced Servilia, and Caepio divorced Livia. Drusus apparently had his sister remarried almost immediately, either in 97 or 96 BC,E. Gabba, Republican Rome, the Army, and the Allies (Berkley: 1976), p. 134 this time to Marcus Porcius Cato, the grandson of Cato the Elder. Livia and Cato had a son, Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis, who was to become the famous opponent of Julius Caesar; they also had a daughter, Porcia, who married Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. However, both Livia and Cato seem to have died in the mid to late 90s BC, meaning that Servilia, Cato, and Porcia were all raised in Drusus' house before his own death in 91 BC.Plutarch, Life of Cato the Younger 1 See also * Livia (gens)  Notes  :1.Among the Roman aristocracy, it was customary for first- born males to receive the same praenomen as their father. According to this principle, the younger Marcus ought to be the eldest child. However, prosopograhers have suggested that Mamercus may be the eldest (surviving) child.e.g. G.V. Sumner, The Orators in Cicero's Brutus, p. 111 If this is true, then the elder Drusus had a first-born child (sometime between c.130-125 BC), whom he named Marcus: however, this child died in infancy, meaning that the elder Drusus later re-used the praenomen 'Marcus' for his third-born son. :2.Some scholars doubt the existence of this aedileship, since it does not appear on Drusus' preserved elogium (CIL 6.1312 = Inscr. Ital. 13.3.74), dating to the Augustan era.e.g. R. Evans, Questioning Reputations (Pretoria, 2003), p.156 n.52. However, the elogia are not always one-hundred percent accurate, so the issue remains unanswered. :3.Appian thinks that Drusus' proposal to extend Roman citizenship to all the Italian allies was put forward at this early stage, in order to attract support for his other laws (Appian, Civil Wars 1.35-6). However, recent scholarship has questioned the accuracy of Appian's narrative at this point.Most notably: H. Mouritsen, Italian Unification: A Study in Ancient and Modern Historiography (London: 1998) It has been suggested, for instance, that the enfranchisement of Italy would be a highly controversial proposal. Not only would the roll of citizens increase exponentially with such a bill, but it would involve a fundamental reorganisation of all aspects of Roman society, from the army to taxation to the law. It would seem questionable therefore for Drusus to propose this deeply divisive bill at the start of his tribunate, when he was still positioning himself as a champion of tradition and the concordia ordinum (Cicero, De Oratore 1.7.24). Modern scholars therefore tend to take the side of Velleius Paterculus, whose narrative puts the Italian bill after the rest of Drusus' legislation (Vel. Pat. 2.14.1). :4.It is not clear whether the 'Marcus Livius Drusus' in question was the elder or younger Drusus: as a result, it may well have been Drusus' father who had debased the coinage at an earlier date. :5.On the ancients' fear of one man growing too powerful as a result of enfranchisement: 'a free state will become a monarchy, if a huge multitude attains the citizenship by virtue of the activity of one man' ('Sallust', ep. ad Caes. II. 6. 1.).

His father was Dr. Peter Fielding Browne (1813-1880), and his mother, Sally Cropper Bayly (1813-1857), was likewise from an established planter family. He had a sister who died as an infant and an elder brother Orris Applethwaite Browne (1842-1898). Educated by private tutors, Browne later attended Hanover Academy and Bloomfield Academy, both in Virginia. After the American Civil War discussed below, Browne studied law and graduated from the law department of the University of Virginia in 1867. After the war, Browne married Anna Drummond Fletcher (1849-1926), and one of their daughters and two sons (including the future World War I artillery commander and Brigadier General Beverly Fielding Browne) survived to adulthood.

The park's adjacent Lighthouse Visitor Center features exhibits about the lighthouse and the park's marine life and natural history. Visitors can climb about 300 steps down to the lighthouse itself, weather permitting. The main chamber of the lighthouse, known as the Lens Room, features the Fresnel lens and clockwork mechanism, and is open to the public on a limited basis. History A lighthouse was assigned to Point Reyes in 1855, but construction was delayed for fifteen years because of a dispute between the United States Lighthouse Board and the landowners over a fair price for the land. The lighthouse is a sixteen sided, tower, and a twin of Cape Mendocino Light. The first-order Fresnel lens was first lit on December 1, 1870. Electricity came to the lighthouse in 1938, and concrete steps were built into the cliff in 1939. The station was automated in 1975. The following historical information from March 1962 is maintained on the USCG web site: > Point Reyes Light Station was established in 1870 at Point Reyes, Calif., > from the nearest town of Inverness.

Description It reaches a length of between 19 and 22 cm. The wings are about 17 cm. Its plumage is rufous brown and exhibits black shaft streaks. The underparts and the facial disc are rufous. The long grey legs are unfeathered. The eyes are large and golden yellow. The ear tufts are very small. Its call which sounds like a rasping \\"whaugh\\" with various \\"tok tok\\" notes can be heard from a far distance and in particular in the darkness. Its diet consists of geckos, tree frogs and insects (e.g. locusts). Status The range of this bird when first described in 1880 were the Seychelles islands of Praslin, Mah√©, and Silhouette Island. Due to the clearing of the mountainous cloud forests and introduced alien animals, like rats, cats, and barn owls the population had dropped so drastically that it was thought to be extinct by 1906. In 1959 it was rediscovered by French naturalist Phillippe Loustau- Lalanne in a mountainous cloud forest at an altitude of 200 meter above sea level on the island of Mah√©. In 1999 the first nest was discovered but there was no breeding success. In 2000 the first infrared photograph was shot of a female with her juvenile. Due to the lack of information about the population this species was long regarded as critically endangered by the IUCN. Due to the discovery of further populations it was noticed by 2002 that the population was stable at about 318 individuals. Today the range consists of 159 territories which cover an area of 33 km¬≤. Thanks to the new knowledge and the conservation efforts on Mah√© this species was reclassified as endangered in 2004.

The members of the Cincinnati \\"Black Brigade\\" were among the first African Americans to be employed in the military defense of the Union. The fortifications‚Äîincluding forts, miles of military roads, miles of rifle pits, magazines, and hundreds of acres of cleared forests‚Äîat the border of Northern Kentucky thwarted the major threat to Cincinnati during the Civil War. Brigade service Background Race relations in Cincinnati at the time were incredibly volatile. While the city had more than its share of exceptional abolition leaders before the American Civil War, the attitude of Cincinnatians in general towards abolitionism was one of open hostility. Most of the citizens discountenanced the institution of slavery but were willing to wink at its continuance in the South for financial reasons. The intensity of sentiments has risen up to destruction of property, killings, and mob violence against blacks since about the 1830's. Peter H. Clark states, \\"Nowhere has the prejudice against colored people been more cruelly manifested than here.\\" Cincinnati, which lies along the Ohio River in southern Ohio, bordered the Union-held slave state of Kentucky. People from Ohio were \\"aggressively barring\\" blacks from migrating to the state. State laws, called the Black Laws of 1804 and 1807, required that blacks provided proof that they were free and posted $500 guaranteeing good behavior. Blacks did not have the right to vote. They could not testify against white people in trials, whether by law before 1849 or mob rule after the law preventing their testimony was overturned.

Hearing that they were meeting to discuss providing service during the war, there were attempts to shut down the meeting and intimidate attendees. The Commercial stated that black men should not interfere in the war. Their offer was refused by the city, and they were told there no need for their help in a \\"white man's war.\\" This was contrary to the wishes of Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace who intended to enlist the help of the city's black residents to construct defensive fortifications. Advancing Confederate troops On August 30, Confederate troops defeated the hastily- assembled Army of Kentucky at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, about 100 miles south of Cincinnati. By early September 1862, Union Army regiments from Ohio, Indiana, and other northern states were ordered the Cincinnati area to defend it from the advancing Confederate Army. Wallace placed the city under martial law on September 1 and assumed command of the city. Mayor George Hatch asked for all men to assist in the defense of the city and that the police force would be placed under Wallace's command and act as provost guards. Men unexpectedly forced into service On September 2, 1862, the Cincinnati police force abruptly and forcefully impressed male black residents to construct fortifications, often at gunpoint and with rough treatment, and without a plan or explanation. The men were gathered and put in a mule pen on Plum Street, not knowing what would become of them and fearfully that they might be left in Kentucky and become enslaved. Some of the men labored at the river and others were taken at bayonet to work as servants, camp cooks and laundrymen for Union troops at Fort Wright. About 400 men were taken to regimental camps and were held there. They were held for two days, during which they worked continuously for 36 hours without sleep and received half rations of food. The treatment was denounced by the Cincinnati Daily Gazette, that stated \\"Let our colored fellow-soldiers be treated civilly\\" and \\"treated like men\\". It was the only local newspaper to condemn the unjust treatment. Fortifications Alarmed by reports of the mishandling by the police force and mistreatment by the army, Wallace put Colonel William M. Dickson in charge, who let the seized men return to their homes and announced a new call for black volunteers to report the next day. In the meantime, the police were relieved of provost guard duty and promised not to arrest any more black men, except for criminal activity. Black men who had escaped to the country or were securely hidden to avoid coming under control of the provost guards, returned to the city. Ohio Historical Society. At 5 a.m. on September 5th, 706 volunteers reported for duty and were put to work. The officers of the brigade as of September 6, 1862 were all white and included: commander, William M. Dickson; Adjutant-General, T. C. Day; Commissary, H. McBurney; Quartermaster, J. S. Hill; Assistant Adjutant-General, Jacob Reior. With Dickson in charge, the soldiers of the Black Brigade received their own military unit flag and $13 a month--a Union Army private's pay--along with various privileges, including the right to visit their families. Henry Mosler, Preparations for Defense at Cincinnati, sketch, Harper‚Äôs Weekly, September 20, 1862 Put \\"far in advance of the Union lines\\" and without weapons, a pontoon bridge was built to bring the Black Brigade into Northern Kentucky. The Black Brigade commenced work that consisted of digging rifle pits, clearing trees as well as building forts, magazines, and roads. They often conducted work almost a mile in front of the front lines, with only a few cavalry scouts between them and Confederate forces. They were nearly mistaken for Confederate soldiers due to how far they were from Union troops. A mural depicting the \\"Squirrel Hunters\\", local militia from Ohio, marching in Defense of Cincinnati (1862). Confederate General Henry Heth led 8,000 soldiers from Louisville, Kentucky to the area by September 11. They reconnoitered for two days and then withdrew, believing that they would not be successful there in a battle with a volunteer force of 76,000 \\"Squirrel Hunters\\" who had assembled in the Defense of Cincinnati. The brigade continued to work until September 20, when there was no longer a threat to Cincinnati. When they were done, hundreds of acres of forests had been cleared and miles of rifle pits were dug. They had built forts, magazines, and miles of military roads and breastworks along the border with Northern Kentucky between Fort Thomas and Bromley. The fortifications were built far enough away from Cincinnati that they could not shell the city. There were a total of 1,000 black men who served in defence of the city. There were the 700 men who built the fortifications and another 300 men who performed work in military camps, in the city, and on gun boats. The Brigade had one fatality: Joseph Johns who was killed when a tree fell on him accident on September 17, 1862. Dickson was presented with an engraved sword by the members of the brigade. He thanked them by stating, \\"...you have labored cheerfully and effectively. Go to your homes with the consciousness of having performed your duty.....and bearing with you the gratitude and respect of all honorable men.\\" The most significant threat to Cincinnati from the Confederates during the Civil War occurred in 1862 and the fortifications built by the Black Brigade are credited with thwarting that threat. 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, The Storming of Fort Wagner, 1890, by Kurz and Allison Because of racial segregation, the city would not allow black men to join the all-white volunteer militia. The Black Brigade was never intended to serve as armed soldiers, and saw no combat during the war. There were some men, though, who enlisted in the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment or in other regiments of the Union Army, like the Corps d'Afrique and 75th Regiment Infantry U.S. Colored Troops in the Mississippi Valley.

It is a generalization of the direct and semidirect products. It is named after Guido Zappa (1940) and Jen≈ë Sz√©p (1950) although it was independently studied by others including B.H. Neumann (1935), G.A. Miller (1935), and J.A. de S√©guier (1904). Internal Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p products Let G be a group with identity element e, and let H and K be subgroups of G. The following statements are equivalent: * G = HK and H ‚à© K = {e} * For each g in G, there exists a unique h in H and a unique k in K such that g = hk. If either (and hence both) of these statements hold, then G is said to be an internal Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p product of H and K. Examples Let G = GL(n,C), the general linear group of invertible n √ó n matrices over the complex numbers. For each matrix A in G, the QR decomposition asserts that there exists a unique unitary matrix Q and a unique upper triangular matrix R with positive real entries on the main diagonal such that A = QR. Thus G is a Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p product of the unitary group U(n) and the group (say) K of upper triangular matrices with positive diagonal entries. One of the most important examples of this is Philip Hall's 1937 theorem on the existence of Sylow systems for soluble groups. This shows that every soluble group is a Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p product of a Hall p'-subgroup and a Sylow p-subgroup, and in fact that the group is a (multiple factor) Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p product of a certain set of representatives of its Sylow subgroups. In 1935, George Miller showed that any non-regular transitive permutation group with a regular subgroup is a Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p product of the regular subgroup and a point stabilizer. He gives PSL(2,11) and the alternating group of degree 5 as examples, and of course every alternating group of prime degree is an example. This same paper gives a number of examples of groups which cannot be realized as Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p products of proper subgroups, such as the quaternion group and the alternating group of degree 6. External Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p products As with the direct and semidirect products, there is an external version of the Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p product for groups which are not known a priori to be subgroups of a given group. To motivate this, let G = HK be an internal Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p product of subgroups H and K of the group G. For each k in K and each h in H, there exist Œ±(k,h) in H and Œ≤(k,h) in K such that kh = Œ±(k,h) Œ≤(k,h). This defines mappings Œ± : K √ó H ‚Üí H and Œ≤ : K √ó H ‚Üí K which turn out to have the following properties: * Œ±(e,h) = h and Œ≤(k,e) = k for all h in H and k in K. * Œ±(k1 k2, h) = Œ±(k1, Œ±(k2, h)) * Œ≤(k, h1 h2) = Œ≤(Œ≤(k, h1), h2) * Œ±(k, h1 h2) = Œ±(k, h1) Œ±(Œ≤(k,h1),h2) * Œ≤(k1 k2, h) = Œ≤(k1,Œ±(k2,h)) Œ≤(k2,h) for all h1, h2 in H, k1, k2 in K. From these, it follows that * For each k in K, the mapping h Œ±(k,h) is a bijection of H. * For each h in H, the mapping k Œ≤(k,h) is a bijection of K. (Indeed, suppose Œ±(k,h1)=Œ±(k,h2). Then h1=Œ±(k‚àí1k,h1) = Œ±(k‚àí1, Œ±(k,h1))=Œ±(k‚àí1, Œ±(k,h2))=h2. This establishes injectivity, and for surjectivity, use h=Œ±(k,Œ±(k‚àí1,h)).) More concisely, the first three properties above assert the mapping Œ± : K √ó H ‚Üí H is a left action of K on H and that Œ≤ : K √ó H ‚Üí K is a right action of H on K. If we denote the left action by h ‚Üí kh and the right action by k ‚Üí kh, then the last two properties amount to k(h1h2) = kh1 kh1h2 and (k1k2)h = k1k2hk2h. Turning this around, suppose H and K are groups (and let e denote each group's identity element) and suppose there exist mappings Œ± : K √ó H ‚Üí H and Œ≤ : K √ó H ‚Üí K satisfying the properties above. On the cartesian product H √ó K, define a multiplication and an inversion mapping by, respectively, * (h1, k1) (h2, k2) = (h1 Œ±(k1,h2), Œ≤(k1,h2) k2) * (h,k)‚àí 1 = (Œ±(k‚àí 1,h‚àí 1), Œ≤(k‚àí 1,h‚àí 1)) Then H √ó K is a group called the external Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p product of the groups H and K. The subsets H √ó {e} and {e} √ó K are subgroups isomorphic to H and K, respectively, and H √ó K is, in fact, an internal Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p product of H √ó {e} and {e} √ó K. Relation to semidirect and direct products Let G = HK be an internal Zappa‚ÄìSz√©p product of subgroups H and K. If H is normal in G, then the mappings Œ± and Œ≤ are given by, respectively, Œ±(k,h) = k h k‚àí 1 and Œ≤(k, h) = k. This is easy to see because (h_1k_1)(h_2k_2) = (h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1})(k_1k_2) and h_1k_1h_2k_1^{-1}\\\\in H since by normality of H, k_1h_2k_1^{-1}\\\\in H. In this case, G is an internal semidirect product of H and K. If, in addition, K is normal in G, then Œ±(k,h) = h. In this case, G is an internal direct product of H and K. References * , Kap.

Regarded as the \\"father of Georgian romanticism\\", he was a pre-eminent Georgian aristocrat and a talented general in the Imperial Russian service. Early life Alexander Chavchavadze was a member of the noble family elevated to the princely rank by the Georgian king Constantine II of Kakhetia in 1726. The family was of Khevsur origin but had intermarried with other Georgian military and noble families. He was born in 1786, in St Petersburg, Russia, where his father, Prince Garsevan Chavchavadze, served as an ambassador of Heraclius II, king of Kartli and Kakheti in eastern Georgia. Tsarina Catherine II of Russia was a godmother at the baptism of infant Alexander, showing her benevolence to the Georgian diplomat.Kveselava, M (2002), Anthology of Georgian Poetry, The Minerva Group, Inc., , p. 181 Alexander's early education was Russian. He first saw his native Georgia at the age of 13, when the family moved back to Tiflis after the Russian annexation of eastern Georgia (1801). At the age of 18, Alexander Chavchavadze joined Prince Parnaoz, a member of the dispossessed royal family, in the 1804 rebellion in the mountainous Georgian province of Mtiuleti against Russian rule. Following the suppression of the uprising, he was briefly put in prison where he composed his first literary works, including a radical poem written in Georgian, Woe to This World and Its Tenants (·Éï·Éê·É∞, ·É°·Éù·É§·Éî·Éö·É°·Éê ·Éê·Éõ·Éê·É° ·Éì·Éê ·Éõ·Éò·É°·Éó·Éê ·Éõ·Éì·Éí·Éõ·É£·É†·Éó·Éê). The poem quickly gained popularity, and brought early fame to its young author. His manuscripts were widely circulated with his lyrics of love or protest, written in the spirit of the 18th-century Georgian poet Besiki or of the French Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, sung in Tiflis and elsewhere in Georgia. Prince Alexander Chavchavadze in hussar uniform. Following a year's exile in Tambov, Chavchavadze reconciled with the new regime and entered a hussar regiment. Ironically, he fought in the Russian ranks under Marquis Paulucci when the next anti-Russian rebellion broke out in 1812 in Kakheti and was wounded in the fighting. In the same year, he married a Georgian princess Salome Orbeliani, a prominent noble family with familial ties to the Bagrationi royal line. During the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813-4) against Napoleon I of France, he served as an aide-de-camp to the Russian commander Barclay de Tolly and was wounded in his leg at the Battle of Paris on 31 March 1814. As an officer in the Russian expeditionary forces, he stayed in Paris for two years and the restored Bourbon dynasty awarded him for his service with a L√©gion d'honneur. Open to new ideas, in particular to the early French Romanticism, he was impressed by Lamartine and Victor Hugo, as well as Racine and Corneille, whose writing entered Georgian literature through Chavchavadze. Military and political career In 1817, Prince Chavchavadze became a colonel of the Russian army. Promoted to Major General in 1826, his military career advanced remarkably during the Russian wars against the Persian and Ottoman empires in the late 1820s. He was instrumental in the conquest of Iravan from Persia in 1827Allen, WED (1971), A History of the Georgian people: From the Beginning Down to the Russian Conquest in the Nineteenth Century, New York City: Barnes & Noble, p. 234. and was appointed, in 1828, a military governor of the Armenian Military District. During the 1828-9 Russo-Turkish war, with a small detachment, he organised a successful defence of the Yerevan province against the marauding Kurds and his forces surged into Anatolia, taking control of the whole pashate of Bajazet from the Turkish forces from 25 August to 9 September 1828.Blanch, L (1995), Sabres of Paradise, Carroll & Graf Publishers, , p 54. In 1829, he was dispatched as an administrator of the military board of Kakheti, where his patrimonial estates were located. Back in Georgia, Alexander enjoyed overwhelming popularity among the Georgian nobility and people. He was highly respected by his fellow Russian and Georgian officers. At the same time, he was regarded as Georgia's most refined, educated and wealthy 19th-century aristocrat, fluent in several European and Asiatic languages and with extensive and friendly ties with the cream of Georgian and Russian society who frequented his famous salon in Tiflis. The prominent Russian diplomat and playwright Alexander Griboyedov married his 16-year-old daughter Nino, whom the famous Russian poet had tutored in music during his brief stay in Tiflis. Another daughter, Catherine, married David Dadiani, prince of Mingrelia, and inspired in Nicholas Baratashvili the hopeless love that made him the greatest poet of Georgian Romanticism. At his Italianate summer mansion in Tsinandali, Kakheti, he frequently entertained foreign guests with music, wit, and ‚Äì most especially ‚Äì the fine vintages made at his estate winery (marani). Chavchavadze built Georgia's oldest and largest winery where he combined European and centuries- long Georgian wine-making traditions. The highly regarded dry white Tsinandali is still produced there.Goldstein, D (1999), The Georgian Feast: The Vibrant Culture and Savory Food of the Republic of Georgia, University of California Press, , p. 53. According to his acquaintance, Juan Van Halen, Chavchavadze, \\"a Georgian prince, educated in Europe,... though serving in our regiment with the rank of colonel, had succeeded, without neglecting his military duties, in improving his valuable inheritance in such a manner that few Georgian nobles can compare with him in wealth.\\" Alexander Chavchavadze's wife Salome, n√©e Orbeliani Despite his loyal service to the Russian crown, Chavchavadze's nostalgia for Georgia's lost independence, monarchy, and the Georgian Orthodox Church once again pushed him into rebellion, joining the 1832 conspiracy aimed at organising a large-scale uprising against the Russian hegemony. The failed coup plot turned into a disaster for the Georgian literature: most of his poetry written between 1820 and 1832, inspired by Romanticism and egalitarianism, was burned by the author as possible evidence against him. He was sentenced to the five-year exile to Tambov, but the tsar, who needed his military talents given the ongoing Caucasian War, forgave him. Chavchavadze joined the expedition against the rebellious mountain people of the North Caucasus. Like his many fellow Georgian nobles, he found a good opportunity to take revenge for the numerous past raids on the Georgian marches organised by North Caucasus tribes. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1841, and continued his service in the Caucasus, briefly as head of the civil administration of the region from 1842 to 1843. In 1843, he fought in his last war, commanding a successful punitive expedition against the rebellious Dagestani tribes. Later, he was appointed a member of the Council of the Chief Administration of Transcaucasus. In 1846, Alexander Chavchavadze fell victim to an accident, under somewhat mysterious circumstances: while returning to his palace in Tsinandali at night, somebody from the nearby woods approached him and splashed hot water while he was galloping on his horse. He lost the control of the horse and crashed into the ditch nearby. He died from the resultant severe head injuries. Although the tragedy was most likely an accident, it was rumoured that he was killed by Russian assassins. He was buried at the Shuamta Monastery in Kakheti, Georgia. Chavchavadze was survived by a son, David, who was also a lieutenant general in the Russian service during the Caucasus Wars, and three daughters, Nino, Catherine, and Sophia. Writings Alexander Chavchavadze's house Chavchavadze's influence over Georgian literature was immense. He moved the Georgian poetic language closer to the vernacular, combining the elements of the formal wealth and somewhat artificial antiquated \\"high\\" style inherited from the 18th-century Georgian Renaissance literature, melody of Persian lyrical poetry, particularly Hafiz and Saadi, bohemian language of the streets of Tiflis and the moods and themes of European Romanticism. The subject of his works varied from purely anacreontic in his early period to deeply philosophic in his maturity. Chavchavadze's contradictory career ‚Äì his participation in the struggle against the Russian control of Georgia, on one hand, and the loyal service to the tsar, including the suppression of Georgian peasant revolts, on the other hand ‚Äì found a noticeable reflection in his writings. The year 1832, when the Georgian plot collapsed, divides his work into two principal periods. Prior to that event, his poetry was mostly impregnated with laments for the former grandeur of Georgia, the loss of national independence and his personal grievances connected with it; his native country under the Russian empire seemed to him a prison, and he pictured its present state in extremely gloomy colors. The death of his beloved friend and son-in-law, Griboyedov, also contributed to the depressive character of his writings of that time.

In his Romantic poems, Chavchavadze dreamed of Georgia's glorious past, when \\"the breeze of life past\\" would \\"breathe sweetness\\" into his \\"dry soul.\\" In poems Woe, time, time (·Éï·Éê·É∞, ·Éì·É†·Éù·Éú·Éò, ·Éì·É†·Éù·Éú·Éò), Listen, listener (·Éò·É°·Éõ·Éò·Éú·Éî·Éó ·Éõ·É°·Éõ·Éî·Éú·Éú·Éù), and Caucasia (·Éô·Éê·Éï·Éô·Éê·É°·Éò·Éê), the \\"Golden Age\\" of medieval Georgia was contrasted with its unremarkable present.Suny, RG (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition, Indiana University Press, , p. 124 As a social activist, however, he remained mostly a \\"cultural nationalist,\\" defender of the native language, and an advocate of the interest of Georgian aristocratic and intellectual elites. In his letters, Alexander heavily criticized Russian treatment of Georgian national culture and even compared it with the pillaging by Ottomans and Persians who had invaded Georgia in the past. In one of the letters he states: The damage which Russia has inflicted on our nation is disastrous. Even Persians and Turks could not abolish our Monarchy and deprive us of our statehood. We have exchanged one serpent for another. After 1832, his perception of the national problems became different. The poet unambiguously pointed out those positive results which had been brought about by the Russian annexation, though the liberation of his native land remained to be his most cherished dream.Gamezardashvili, DM (2001), Georgian Literature, The Minerva Group, Inc. , p. 50 Later, his poetry became less romantic, even sentimental, but he never abandoned his optimistic streak that makes his writings so different from those of his predecessors. Some of the most original of his late poems are, Oh, my dream, why have you appealed to me again (·Éî·É∞·Éê, ·É©·Éî·Éõ·Éù ·Éù·É™·Éú·Éî·Éë·Éê·Éï, ·Éô·Éï·Éö·Éê·Éï ·É†·Éê·Éì ·É¨·Éê·É†·Éõ·Éù·Éõ·Éî·Éì·Éí·Éò·Éú·Éî), and The Ploughman (·Éí·É£·Éó·Éú·Éò·É° ·Éì·Éî·Éì·Éê) written in the 1840s. The former, a rather sad poem, surprisingly ends with hope for the future in contemplation of the poet. The latter combines Chavchavadze's elegy for his past years of youth with calm humorous farewell to lost sex-life and potency.Rayfield, D (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History, Routledge (UK), , p. 148 Chavchavadze also composed a historic work, \\"The Short sketches of the history of Georgia from 1801 to 1831.\\" Honours and awards * Order of St. Anne, 1st Class * Order of Vladimir, 2nd Class * Order of the White Eagle * Legion of Honour (France)  See also  * Chavchavadze, Georgian surname References External links * –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤, –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä (–ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –õ–µ—Ä–º–æ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –ê—Å—Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞—Ü–∏—è, 2006). –ì—Ä—É–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–Ω—è–∑—å –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ß–∞–≤—á–∞–≤–∞–¥–∑–µ Category:1786 births Category:1846 deaths Category:Nobility of Georgia (country) Category:Military personnel from Georgia (country) Category:19th- century poets from Georgia (country) Category:Male poets from Georgia (country) Category:Historical novelists from Georgia (country) Category:Romantic poets Category:Imperial Russian Army generals Category:Georgian generals in imperial Russian service Category:Georgian lieutenant generals (Imperial Russia) Category:People from Saint Petersburg Category:People of the Russo-Persian Wars Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Russian) Category:Recipients of the Legion of Honour Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Anna, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Vladimir, 2nd class Category:Russian military personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Russian military personnel of the Caucasian War ","title":"Alexander Chavchavadze"},{"id":"7094159","text":"The New Spirit is a 1942 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and released by the War Activities Committee of the Motion Pictures Industry. The cartoon, which stars Donald Duck, was the first film created as part of Walt Disney's World War II propaganda production. It was commissioned by Henry Morgenthau Jr., then Secretary of the Treasury, to encourage American citizens to pay their income tax in support of the war effort. The film was directed by Wilfred Jackson and Ben Sharpsteen, and features Clarence Nash as the voice of Donald, Fred Shields as the radio announcer, and Cliff Edwards singing the theme song. The New Spirit was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 15th Academy Awards, an honor it shared with 24 other films.Academy Awards Database The following year, Disney released The Spirit of '43 which had a similar purpose and reused many of the scenes from The New Spirit. The film was released, for the first time since its original theatrical release, in 2004 on the DVD set Walt Disney Treasures: On the Front Lines. Plot The film begins with Donald Duck, flush with the contemporary patriotic spirit present with the United States' full entry into World War II, dancing to a patriotic song. A radio announcer tells about the new patriotic spirit and asks Donald if he is willing to do his part. Donald fervently asserts his loyalty and begs to know how best to show it. His enthusiasm fades when the radio announcer advises he pay his income tax promptly. However, the announcer changes Donald's mind by stressing the country's need for resources to aid the war effort. Now that Donald is motivated once again, the announcer, along with the help of a talking dip pen, inkwell, blotter, and note pad, show Donald how to properly fill out his simplified Form 1040 A.Donald files as Head of family as he is single and able to claim Huey, Dewey, and Louie as dependants, making his payment of $13 authentic according to the tax bracket. Donald has often been associated with the number 13, a reference to his often predictable bad luck. This is also seen in his fictional address of 1313 Hollywood Boulevard given on the form as well as his bank and check number. After this the announcer urges Donald to mail his payment to the Federal government at once, and Donald enthusiastically races across the nation to Washington, D.C. to deliver it in person. The film concludes with a montage of images to illustrate to the audience the wartime necessities the money is needed for such as munitions and combat vehicles to defeat the Axis powers. With a final images framed in a sky lined with red, white and blue, the announcer repeats The Four Freedoms and reminds the audience that taxes are essential for victory and will keep democracy on the march. Background Under the Revenue Act of 1942, approximately 15 million American citizens would become eligible to pay income tax for the first time. In anticipation of the law's passing, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. requested that Disney produce a film to cast the tax increase in a positive light and to explain why the government needed the money. A main part of the goal was to ensure that the taxes were paid on time, and to create as little resentment among the public as possible. However, there was significant disagreement between Walt Disney and Morgenthau on who should star in the film. After Disney presented a storyboard of the film in Washington, Morgenthau said that he did not like Donald Duck, and preferred instead a new character to represent \\"Mr. Average Taxpayer.\\" This, he thought, could better convey the seriousness of the issue. But Disney was adamant that Donald be used. The duck was at the time the studio's biggest star, and Disney felt that using him could make a painful task as fun as possible. Disney eventually got his way. Reception Time magazine said that \\"although the cartoon does not make the new short-form blank crystal clear, it gets its propaganda across with the anesthetic blessing of laughter and great good humor. As cinema, The New Spirit is a most effective job.\\" It added, somewhat tongue in cheek, that \\"Bachelor Duck has complained about a lot of things, but his salary ($2,501) is not one of them. Its revelation is pure patriotism on his part.\\" At the 15th Academy Awards the next year the film was one of 25 films nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Among the public, the film created its desired effect; income taxes were more prompt in 1942 than in any year previous. Historians have cited Gallup Polls to show more than 60 million people saw the short in theaters, and it contributed to an increase of twice as many income tax filings from the previous year. Despite the film's response, members of Congress did not appropriate $80,000 for the production. The U.S. Treasury had to fund the film from different sources. Adaptations A comic strip version of The New Spirit was published in Look magazine. This version of the story was shorter, and ended with Donald actually mailing the tax form.

As a teenager he played in rock bands before becoming interested in acoustic blues and jazz. He listened to the Jazz Crusaders, Jimmy Smith, and Miles Davis, but Misterioso by Thelonious Monk got his attention most at the age of 16. He learned about ragtime from his teacher, stride pianist Buck Evans. In the early 1970s, he moved to San Francisco and performed a wide range of material, which can be heard on his debut album, There's Something for Everyone in America, on Kicking Mule Records. In addition to developing his solo style, he immersed himself in the local swing jazz and avant-garde jazz scene. He was in a swing guitar duet with Thom Keats and a bluegrass band. From the late 1970s to the middle 1980s, he lived in Europe, spending time among free jazz musicians in London. During these years, he played with Eugene Chadbourne, John Zorn, Henry Kaiser, Woody Mann, and Jim Nichols. He toured throughout the world and released an album of Scottish and Irish music before returning to America in 1987.

Early life and medical career The Scottish-born Forgan was the son of a Church of Scotland minister.Dorril, p. 151 Educated up to doctorate level at Aberdeen Grammar School, and the Universities of Aberdeen and Cambridge, he entered the medical profession and served in this capacity in World War I.Benewick, p. 112 Dr. Forgan became a leading light in his field, serving as Vice-President of the Medical Society for the Study of Venereal Diseases and became recognised as a leading expert on Sexually transmitted diseases. He served as a Public Health Officer in Glasgow and in this capacity he adopted socialism due to the poor conditions in the city. Political career ILP and New Party Forgan entered local politics as a member of Glasgow council after seeing active service in the war. Initially a member of the Independent Labour Party, he was elected to Parliament for West Renfrewshire in the 1929 general election. An early triumph saw him secure the installation of a ventilation system into the House of Commons, although after this he became a fairly marginal figure.Benewick, p. 113 Forgan was one of the signatories of the 'Mosley Memorandum' which outlined his political vision and he followed Mosley into the New Party when it was set up soon afterwards.Benewick, p. 66 He had officially left the Labour Party on 24 February 1931Skidelsky, p. 243 and, sometime that year, co-authored with Adam Marshall Diston The New Party and the ILP (written as an appeal to ILP membersN.

(2009) in Contemporary British History 23 (4)).Robert Benewick, Political Violence & Public Order: A Study of British Fascism (Allen Lane, 1969) He was appointed to a council for policy and strategy formation that was set up to decide the running of the party and also acted as Chief Whip during the New Party's brief run in Parliament.Benweick, p. 76 At the 1931 general election, Forgan polled 1,304 votes in West Renfrewshire in what represented one of the better results for the New Party in a disappointing election.Benewick, p. 81 A close friend of Oswald Mosley, Forgan was godfather to his son Michael.Dorril, p. 204 British Union of Fascists With Mosley having embraced fascism Forgan followed his lead and on Mosley's behalf led unsuccessful talks with the British Fascists, aimed at having that movement taken over by the New Party.Griffiths, p. 36 Forgan joined Mosley's British Union of Fascists and was initially Director of Organisation. This administrative role did not prove suitable and soon he became an important background figure, arranging private functions with leading businessmen in an attempt to secure support for Mosley and organising the January Club to this end.Benewick, p. 94 Forgan was keen to stress that the BUF had no ban on Jews despite the activities of Adolf Hitler.Benewick, p. 153 Indeed, Forgan attempted to court influential Jews, such as Liberal MP Harry Nathan and Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet, through the January Club and even held meetings with the leaders of the Board of Deputies of British Jews.Dorril, p. 310 Forgan was also keen to keep the BUF aloof from rival far right groups such as the Imperial Fascist League as he felt it was essential to avoid making the BUF seem too foreign in ideological terms.Pugh, p. 130 As a result of his work, Forgan was promoted to deputy leader. He held that position until 1934 when he left the BUF because of its drift towards anti-Semitism. Robert Skidelsky has argued that Forgan's conversion to fascism had always been at best half-hearted and had more to do with his personal loyalty to Mosley, something that was largely gone by that point.Skidelsky, p. 342 Forgan in particular disliked the growing influence of William Joyce, a staunch anti-Semite,Pugh, p. 221 who replaced Wilfred Risdon, a colleague of Forgan's from the ILP and the New Party, as Director of Propaganda the same year. He took no further role in politics. Bibliography * R. Benewick, Political Violence and Public Order, London: Allan Lane, 1969, * S.

El Templo de San Francisco in Chihuahua. History This building was one of the first churches built in Chihuahua City. Construction began in 1717 on a plan that called for a latin cross with a dome over the crossing (the sanctuary is essentially unchanged since completion in 1789); it also served as the first junior school for ladies in Chihuahua. In 1811 the beheaded body of Fr Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, considered the 'Father of the Nation', was intombed in the West Chapel of the temple after his execution by the Spanish; after the independence of Mexico, it was taken to Mexico City.

Branded as ‚Äú95.7 The Big Pig,‚Äù the station operates at 95.7 MHz on the FM dial and operates a mainstream country music format. It is owned by Seven Mountains Media. History The station originally signed on as WHDL-FM in 1949 and in its early years was affiliated, like most upstate New York FMs of the time, with WQXR-FM in New York City. James F. Hastings, later a U.S. Congressman, ran the station from 1952 to 1966. The call sign was changed from WHDL-FM to WEBF-FM in recognition of station owner E. Boyd Fitzpatrick. During the 1980s, the station aired what today's jockeys pejoratively referred to as an \\"elevator music\\" (likely something along the lines of middle-of-the-road, beautiful music or easy listening) format. In September 1988, under new ownership, the station was known as WOLN (not to be confused with FM 91.3, the public radio station that currently uses the callsign) with an adult contemporary format. A year later, on September 29, 1989, the call sign was changed to WPIG. Later, on November 6, mirroring the national trend, the station switched formats to the rapidly burgeoning country music format and became known as \\"The Big Pig 95.7, Today's Sizzlin' Country.\\" It has held the same slogan, branding, and format ever since, for 30 years as of 2019; it thus has the longest uninterrupted and active run with the same format in the Southwestern New York region. WPIG operates under the corporate entity Arrow Communications of New York. The company has variously been held by Sabre Communications, then Backyard Broadcasting, and Community Broadcasters, LLC, who purchased the station in 2013; in January 2019, Community Broadcasters sold its Southern Tier stations to Seven Mountains Media. During the first several years of the country format, WPIG disc jockeys used pseudonyms with pig-based puns, such as: \\"Smokey' Joe Bacon,\\" \\"Michael Hamm,\\" \\"Peggy Banks,\\" \\"Sue EE Cinamon Frank \\"Adam Ribbs,\\" and \\"Christopher Neggs\\" (the first incarnation of The Morning Pigpen's hosts were thus bacon, ham, 'n'eggs; see also the Froggy brand, which uses similar frog-based pun names). This idea was dropped in the late 1990s as the second generation of disc jockeys would join the station, all of whom used more conventional names. Neggs remains with the station as a weekend personality and fill-in, now using his real name, Nick Purcio. The second generation of hosts remained in their positions for over a decade; from 1998 to 2006 and 2008 to 2009, the station's lineup featured the same lineup of disc jockeys. Mark Thompson, the program director and co-host of the morning show, is the last remaining on-air personality from this era; the other three hosts from this era (Casey Hill, Mike \\"Smitty\\" Smith and Jesse Garon, all three of whom have either retired from radio and/or left Western New York) went on to launch WGWE shortly after leaving The Pig. This cleared the way for the third, and later fourth, generation of hosts that currently air on the station. WPIG added the slogan \\"Today's Fun Country\\" in 2009, which rotates with the \\"Sizzlin' Country\\" format. Also added around this time was the Big Pig Jackpot, a contest in which the station announces the amount of money in a progressive jackpot over the course of the day cold-calls random people in the listening area to test if they listen to the station; a person who either knows the answer (or, by chance, guesses correctly) wins the jackpot. The jackpot was dropped in 2014. The station tweaked its image in 2013 with its sale to Community Broadcasters, adding 30-minute blocks of \\"continuous country,\\" dropping national news, auto racing coverage and its Saturday night classic country block, taking over the local chapter of the national Country Showdown competition (which had previously rested with WQRS), and changing its voiceover announcer for the first time since adopting the country format. The station began streaming its programming on the Internet for the first time in its history beginning in 2014. Programming Two programs have been on WPIG ever since its launch: the Morning Pigpen, the station's morning show (currently hosted by Mark Thompson and Danni Lee), and Text Your Tune at Noon (historically the Country Caf√©), an all-request lunch hour; both have changed hosts since their inception. Katie McLean is currently the afternoon host. The syndicated Taste of Country Nights airs in the evenings; historically a local jock (Michael Hamm and Jesse Garon being two of the longest-running) occupied evenings. Weekends include Country Countdown USA and the classic country shows The Original Country Gold with Rowdy Yates (which has been carried, in various forms, on WPIG since 1992) and Rick Jackson's Country Classics. WPIG also has a local news bureau run by Gary Nease, with Nick Purcio reporting. National news is provided by CBS Radio News. Weather is provided by WSTM-TV chief meteorologist Wayne Mahar, with fellow Syracuse-based weatherman Phil Spevak as his designated fill-in.

The station regularly registers by far the top Arbitron ratings in the Olean market. Prior to 2009, the station ranked over a 20 share; the most recent ratings, from fall 2014, show the station having dropped to a 17 share due to increased competition. Other uses * An entirely fictional \\"WPIG\\" radio station made several appearances on the CBS sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati, where it was the hated cross-town rival of the eponymous station. The punchline was that the air staff at WPIG Cincinnati was \\"a bunch of swine.\\" This usage predates the current WPIG's usage of the call sign. * A different fictional \\"WPIG\\" ‚àí WPIG Aurora ‚àí appeared in the 1993 motion picture Wayne's World 2. The station featured two memorable characters in the form of \\"Handsome Dan\\" and \\"Mr. Scream,\\" portrayed by Harry Shearer and Ted McGinley, respectively.

The former lighthouse was relocated to Shelter Cove near Point Delgada, California in 1998, and the historic Fresnel lens to Ferndale, California, in 1948. An automated beacon operated for a number of years but was removed in May 2013. History The Cape Mendocino Lens in the replica building at the Humboldt County Fairgrounds in 2005. () After many ships, including the SS Northerner and a lighthouse tender with supplies to build the facility, were lost to the jagged rocks surrounding the sea stack \\"Sugar Loaf\\" and Blunt's Reef offshore of Cape Mendocino, the lighthouse with attendant buildings including a carpenter shop, an oil house, a barn and a two-story residence were built on of remote rangeland. On December 1, 1868, the light began sending a signal of one white flash every thirty seconds. The United States Coast Guard took control of the Cape Mendocino Lighthouse in 1939 when the United States Lighthouse Service merged with the Coast Guard. The lighthouse was a iron tower, sixteen-sided and double balconied, a twin to the lighthouse at Point Reyes but for the roof shape. At , the height of the light exceeded the Makapuu Point Light, making it the highest focal plane of any lighthouse in the United States. The lens had been shipped in through Eureka, California and then overland to the remote location as it was too risky to ship it directly to the lighthouse. Also due to the remote location, lighthouse tenders serviced the facility. In 1881, three men being sent to the lighthouse were killed while attempting to land in a small boat from the tender Manzanita. New dwellings were built in 1908 for the keepers, some of whom raised cows or ponies for the Ferndale to Petrolia stage coach line. At least ten keepers served this lighthouse from 1869 to 1926. Shipwrecks and strandings In 1905, the continuing danger from Blunt's Reef led to the installation of a lightship, which saved over 150 passengers of the steamer Bear after it ran aground in 1916. After five people were killed while trying to land lifeboats on the rocky shore, it was decided that the others would make for the Blunt's Reef lightship. The survivors clustered on the lightship until they could be taken ashore safely. On 6 August 1921 the Alaska, built in 1889 by the Alaska Steamship Company, stranded and sank at Blunt's Reef off the California coast, showing that even the shore-mounted light and the lightship were not enough to save passing ships. In 1926, a keeper at the light was credited with saving the lives of all on board the Everett a steam schooner which he saw had caught on fire. The keeper called for a rescue via telephone. When the ship arrived to help, they discovered the crew was unconscious from the fire fumes and saved them. In 1941, the Blunt's Reef lightship saved the surviving crew of the SS Emidio, the first casualty of the Imperial Japanese Navy's submarine force action on California's Pacific Coast. Later history After World War II, the original first order Fresnel lens was replaced by an automated rotating aerobeacon. On 24 December 24, 1948 the Coast Guard loaned the lens to the City of Ferndale who dismantled it in 1949, moved it to town, built a replica lighthouse at the entrance to the Humboldt County Fairgrounds and reinstalled the lens there. In 2008, a Coast Guard inspection of the lens resulted in negotiations for the continued housing of the lens in Ferndale. The \\"Save Our Lens\\" group of local citizens raised $100,000 to dismantle and store the lens. By agreement with the Coast Guard in early September 2012, the lens was disassembled and put in temporary storage while the Ferndale Museum is remodeled to display it. The actual lighthouse building continued to deteriorate after being abandoned by the Coast Guard and in 1998 a group of volunteers dismantled the 1868 lighthouse, removed the lantern by Army National Guard helicopter and the remainder of the building by truck. Restored, fitted with new glass and painted by the Cape Mendocino Lighthouse Preservation Society, it was installed at Point Delgada in Mal Coombs Park () in Shelter Cove, California. Current conditions In 1951, the Coast Guard installed a dual aerobeacon, but this light was replaced by a simpler light with a focal plane of , which flashed white every 15 seconds. The new light was located on a cliff about northwest and higher than the old light. The light was turned off on May 29, 2013. Aerial photos show the tower has been removed. While the original lighthouse was moved to Shelter Cove, and the keeper's residence demolished, the oil house is still at the site.

It is an online game in which a virtual team of real cricket players is created and points are scored depending on how those players perform in real life matches. To win a tournament, players must work towards attaining the maximum points and the highest rank on the leaderboard. Fantasy cricket matches A fantasy cricket match is based on batting and bowling orders, which are the most debated part of cricketing strategy. A small change in the order can change the course of the game. The concept involves selecting a team of 11 players and 3 substitutes from the pool of players who play the match. There are no budget caps and player selection is not limited to a particular number of batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders although in some fantasy applications you can only create team according to their prerequisite patterns. An example of their given pattern could be 5 batsman, 1 wicket-keeper, 2 all-rounders, 3 bowlers. A fantasy team can have any type of players. The main aim in a fantasy cricket match is to outscore the opposition by as large of a margin as possible. Fantasy cricket matches can be played in all three international forms: One Day International, Twenty20 and Test Cricket. The limited over matches, namely the One Day Internationals and Twenty20s, are played in two formats ‚Äì daily games and rounds. By country India Fantasy cricket is classified as a \\"game of skill\\", similar to fantasy sports in the United States. Fantasy Cricket for Cash is at the hub of three dynamic industry spokes ‚Äì Internet, gaming and cricket. The Supreme Court of India has explained skill in terms of superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and adroitness. In K.R. Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu AIR 1996 SC 1153, it stated as follows: > \\"A game of skill, on the other hand ‚Äì although the element of chance > necessarily cannot be entirely eliminated ‚Äì is one in which success depends > principally upon the superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and > adroitness of the player.\\"http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1248365/ The relevant excerpt from the Supreme Court's judgment is: \\"There are few games, if any, which consist purely of chance or skill, and as such a game of chance is one in which the element of chance predominates over the element of skill, and a game of skill is one in which the element of skill predominates over the element of chance. It is the dominant element ‚Äì 'skill' or 'chance' ‚Äì which determines the character of the game.\\" The court categorically stated the meaning of skill (in paragraph 20), in the following terms: \\"We, therefore, hold that the expression ‚Äúmere skill‚Äù would mean substantial degree or preponderance of skill.\\" In the case, the Court considered Section 11 of the Tamil Nadu Gaming Act, which excluded the application of the act to games of ‚Äòmere skill‚Äô, and is in pari materia with Section 12 of the Public Gambling Act of 1867.http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1824663/ In that case the Court concluded that horse-racing was a game of skill. United States In USA, cricket is enjoyed largely by Indian sub-continent diaspora. While fantasy (American) football is extremely popular, other sports including cricket lack mass appeal due to limited knowledge of the game in the country. In USA, fantasy sports for cash is defined and exempted by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. The act included a provision that the law would not apply to fantasy sports games, educational games, or any online contest that \\"has an outcome that reflects the relative knowledge of the participants, or their skill at physical reaction or physical manipulation (but not chance), and, in the case of a fantasy or simulation sports game, has an outcome that is determined predominantly by accumulated statistical results of sporting events, including any single score, point-spread, team performance, or individual performance in such sporting events‚Ä¶\\" References Category:Fantasy sports ","title":"Fantasy cricket"},{"id":"7094391","text":"Derail device installed at an industrial site, complete with blue flag protection A derail or derailer is a device used to prevent fouling (blocking or compromising) of a rail track (or collision with anything present on the track, such as a person, or a train) by unauthorized movements of trains or unattended rolling stock. The device works by derailing the equipment as it rolls over or through it. Overview Although accidental derailment is damaging to equipment and track, and requires considerable time and expense to remedy, derails are used in situations where there is a risk of greater damage to equipment, injury or death if equipment is allowed to proceed past the derail point. Applications A derailed train car at a closed siding Derails may be applied: *where sidings meet main lines or other through tracks *at junctions or other crossings to protect the interlocking against unauthorized movement *temporarily at an area where crews are working on a rail line *approaching a drawbridge, dead end, or similar hazard. Design A derail device installed on a siding at Glen Haven, Wisconsin, oriented to protect track located off the bottom of the picture There are four basic forms of derail. Wedge The most common form is a wedge-shaped piece of steel which fits over the top of the rail. If a car or locomotive attempts to roll over it, the wheel flange is lifted over the rail to the outside, derailing it. When not in use, the derail folds away, leaving the rail unobstructed. It can be manually or remotely operated; in the former case it will have a lock applied to prevent it from being moved by unauthorized personnel. This type is common on North American railroads. Derail on Nemuro Main Line, JR Hokkaido. It is set so that a train proceeding away from the camera will remain on the track. Split rail The second type of derail is the \\"split rail\\" type. These are basically a complete or partial railroad switch which directs the errant rolling stock away from the main line. This form is common throughout the UK, where it is called trap points or catch points. A&M; in Rogers, Arkansas Portable The third type of derail is the portable derail, and is used by railroad mechanical forces, as well as some industries. This is often used in conjunction with Blue Flag rules and is temporary in nature. They are placed onto one side of the rail with the derail pointed to the outside of the track. Then there is a part of the derail that is able to be tightened down to the rail and then secured with a locking mechanism. If the derail is left unlocked for any reason or does not have a locking mechanism deployed then the owner of the derail can face substantial fines if found by an FRA inspector . Powered Powered derailer, Temple Mills, Eurostar Maintenance Depot, UK The fourth type of derailer is the powered or motorized derailer, electronically powered through an actuator. This type of derailer can be controlled remotely from an external control panel or manually. It is commonly installed as a part of Depot Personnel Protection Systems, to ensure personnel safety in maintenance workshops and depots. Failures Derails have failed on occasion, such as on April 1, 1987, at Burnham, Illinois, when an unsecured car in a siding defeated a derail and fouled the mainline. Due to rusty rails, the car then failed to shunt the track circuit that should have put block signals to \\"stop\\". On May 15, 2001, CSX 8888 was pulling a train of 47 cars including some loaded with hazardous chemicals, ran uncontrolled for two hours at up to . A portable derail was used but failed, the train simply did not stop. On April 20, 2017, three workers were killed in an accident on the Englewood Railway in Woss, British Columbia when 11 runaway railcars full of logs crashed into them and their equipment while they were working on the line. The railcars had become decoupled at the top of the hill and as they rolled out-of-control down the hill they overpowered the derails which had been installed incorrectly and into rotting rail ties..

Murphy is killed in the line of duty; subsequently, Murphy is resurrected and transformed into the cyborg entity RoboCop by the megacorporation, Omni Consumer Products (OCP). He is referred to as Robo by creators Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner in their original screenplay. Concept and creation Edward Neumeier's script and idea was rejected by many studios, and the name was thought as \\"unsuitable\\". The character was inspired by sources including Iron Man and Judge Dredd. Appearances RoboCop OCP holds a contract to fund and run the Detroit Police Department, with OCP's Security Concepts division providing oversight for the police. In order to supplement the overwhelmed police force, Security Concepts begins developing robotic law enforcement units. Originally, OCP Senior President Dick Jones develops a fully robotic unit called ED (Enforcement Droid)-209, with plans to secure a profitable long-term contract with the military. However, ED-209 severely malfunctions during the simulation of a disarm-and-arrest procedure and kills the test subject, even though he dropped his weapon. Ambitious junior executive Bob Morton takes this as a justified reason to go over Jones's head and pitch his \\"RoboCop\\" program directly to OCP's CEO, the \\"Old Man\\". Morton and his team restructure the police force to place prime candidates with high aptitude and experience in law enforcement into high crime areas where death in the line of duty is much higher. Once a death occurs, the deceased officer's body will be used in the construction of a cyborg law enforcement unit, since the officers have already signed waivers allowing OCP to do whatever they please with their corpses. This unit will build upon the deceased's lifetime of on-the-street law enforcement experience by adding the fastest reflexes modern technology can offer and a memory assisted by an on-board computer. Murphy is one of these candidates. He is partnered with Officer Anne Lewis, a veteran herself of Old Detroit, which is plagued by crime boss Clarence Boddicker and his gang. One day, Murphy and Lewis pursue Boddicker's gang in a rolling shootout following an armed robbery, chasing them to an abandoned steel mill. After they split up to search for the gang, Boddicker's henchman Joe Cox incapacitates Lewis while Murphy is captured by three of Boddicker's lieutenants: Emil Antonowsky, Leon Nash, and Steve Minh. When Boddicker shows up, he asks Murphy for his opinion of him, to which Murphy defiantly and honestly tells him, \\"Buddy, I think you're slime.\\" Boddicker nonchalantly shoots off Murphy's right hand with a shotgun, then the gang members take turns blasting Murphy with shotguns, shearing off Murphy's right arm and blowing holes in every part of his body. Amazingly, Murphy is still alive afterwards (perhaps due to the protective body armor covering his upper body), but Boddicker then executes him with a gunshot to the head. Murphy is rushed to a trauma center, where the doctors try in vain to keep him alive. Because he is pronounced dead, the body is seized by OCP, citing the release forms Murphy signed when he joined the police force. The technicians of the RoboCop Program, led by Morton, take what is left of Murphy's face and portions of his cerebrum and cerebellum and install them in a cybernetic body, in effect resurrecting Alex Murphy as RoboCop.RoboCop 3 (1993) RoboCop quickly proves to be an effective weapon against crime, but RoboCop begins to remember his past life as Murphy, starting with his death at the hands of Boddicker and his gang. Enraged at having had his life stolen from him, RoboCop embarks on a personal quest for vengeance as he hunts down Boddicker, resulting in the arrest or death of his entire gang. When Boddicker confesses to being in Dick Jones' employ, RoboCop attempts to arrest Jones as well. However, RoboCop's classified 'Directive 4' comes into effect, preventing him from arresting Jones. Jones admits ordering Morton's murder to RoboCop, who is subsequently damaged by an ED-209, though he manages to evade the robot. After enduring a massed attack by Lieutenant Hedgecock and his SWAT team, RoboCop is rescued by Lewis. The two hide in an abandoned steel mill after they escape, during which RoboCop confides to Lewis about his memories of his past life. He also uses a drill brought by Lewis to remove his headpiece, showing how his \\"Alex Murphy\\" face is stretched over it. The two are attacked by Boddicker's gang, commissioned by Jones to destroy the cyborg after he realizes that his entire confession of ordering Morton's murder has been recorded. The final confrontation with Boddicker himself ends with RoboCop violently stabbing him in the throat with the computer data spike installed in his fist. RoboCop confronts Jones in the middle of an OCP board meeting, during which Jones takes the \\"Old Man\\" hostage. After admitting that he can take no action due to Directive 4, the \\"Old Man\\" fires Jones, allowing RoboCop to shoot him, since he is no longer an OCP employee. Complimenting RoboCop on his shooting skills, The Old Man asks him his name. Robocop smiles before answering, \\"Murphy\\". RoboCop 2 A year later, OCP attempts to replicate the success they had with Murphy with a new \\"RoboCop 2\\" program; however, all of the candidates selected go insane upon activation and commit suicide or harm others, due to the severe mental strain of their new situations. RoboCop is captured, torn apart by the drug lord Cain and his gang, and his pieces dumped in front of the police station in an effort to send them a message. He is reconstructed and then programmed with numerous other directives that render him virtually ineffective on the street, but he is able to reset his programming and erase his directives by giving himself a massive electric shock, leaving him free to lead a counter-attack against Cain. To find a suitable personality for the \\"RoboCop 2\\" program, Dr. Juliette Faxx considers the criminal element in Cain, reasoning that someone with strong megalomania would relish the power of the new body instead of rejecting the new-found life, just as Murphy came through the process due to his strong sense of justice. Her plan is to use his addiction to the drug Nuke to control him. Upon his death, Cain's brain and spinal column are harvested and placed in a larger, more powerful cybernetic body, referred to as RoboCop 2. Ultimately, Cain's addiction to Nuke proves to be his undoing, as Lewis tempts him with a vial of the drug long enough for RoboCop to attack Cain from behind and remove his brain casing from the robot body. RoboCop smashes the brain on the pavement, eliminating Cain for good. RoboCop 3 Omni Consumer Products (OCP), on the verge of bankruptcy, creates an armed force called the Urban Rehabilitators (\\"Rehabs\\" for short), under the command of Paul McDaggett. Ostensibly, its purpose is to combat rising crime in Old Detroit, augmenting the ranks of the Detroit Police in apprehending violent criminals. In reality, it has been set up to forcibly relocate the residents of Cadillac Heights, killing some of them (including the parents of Nikko, a Japanese- American computer whiz kid) in the process. The police force is gradually superseded by the Rehabs, and violent crime begins to spiral out of control. The Delta City dream of the former OCP CEO, \\"Old Man\\", lives on with the help of the Japanese zaibatsu Kanemitsu Corporation, which has bought a controlling stake in the organisation. Kanemitsu sees the potential in the citywide redevelopment, and moves forward with the plans to remove the current citizens. The company develops and uses its own ninja robots (called \\"Otomo\\") to help McDaggett and the OCP President overcome the resistance of the anti- OCP militia forces. When RoboCop and partner Anne Lewis try to defend civilians from the Rehabs one night, Lewis is mortally wounded by McDaggett and eventually dies. Unable to fight back because of the \\"Fourth Directive\\", RoboCop is saved by members of a resistance movement and eventually joins them. Due to severe damage sustained in the shoot-out RoboCop's systems efficiency plummets, and he asks the resistance to summon Dr. Lazarus, one of the scientists who created him. Upon arrival she begins to repair him, deleting the Fourth Directive in the process. During an earlier raid on an armory the resistance has picked up a jet-pack prototype, originally intended for RoboCop's use, which Lazarus modifies and upgrades. After recovering from his injuries RoboCop conducts a one-man campaign against the Rehabs. He finds McDaggett and attempts to subdue him, but McDaggett is able to escape. McDagget then obtains information from a disgruntled resistance member regarding the location of the resistance fighters base. The base is then attacked by the Rehabs and most of the resistance members are either killed or taken prisoner. Nikko escapes with the help of Lazarus before she is captured and taken to the OCP headquarters as a prisoner. RoboCop returns to the resistance base to find it abandoned. One of the Otomo ninjabots then arrives and attacks him. RoboCop experiences another power drain and his side-arm is destroyed, but eventually he is able to overcome his opponent. Meanwhile, Nikko infiltrates the OCP building and assists Lazarus in broadcasting an improvised video, revealing that OCP is behind the outbreaks of criminality in the city and implicating them in the removal and termination of the Cadillac Heights residents. The broadcast causes OCP's stock to plunge dramatically, driving the company into total ruin. McDaggett decides to execute an all-out strike against Cadillac Heights with the help of the Detroit City police department, but the outraged police officers refused to comply and instead defect to the resistance. As a result, McDaggett turns to hiring street gangs and hooligans to assist with his plans. Having heard Lazarus' broadcast Robocop takes to the air using the jet-pack. As the combined forces of the Rehabs and street gangs are about to wipe out the rebels and Detroit Police, RoboCop mounts an aerial assault on the attackers, leading to their defeat. He then proceeds to the OCP building and confronts the waiting McDaggett. Robocop is then attacked, and nearly defeated, by two Otomo ninjabots. Nikko and Lazarus succeed in reprogramming the ninjabots using a wireless link from a laptop computer, forcing them to attack each other. This triggers a timed self-destruct sequence in both units, forcing Robocop to flee. In igniting his jet-pack, the flaming discharge hits McDaggett's legs, immobilising him. Robocop escapes with Nikko and Lazarus, leaving McDaggett to perish in the blast while attempting to stop the self-destruct devices. As Old Detroit is being cleaned up Kanemitsu arrives and confronts RoboCop and his group, while his translator tells the OCP president on Kanemitsu's behalf that he is fired. Kanemitsu then bows to RoboCop. The deposed OCP President turns to Robocop and says \\"Well, I gotta hand it to ya... what do they call you? Murphy, is it?\\" RoboCop replies, saying \\"My friends call me Murphy. You call me RoboCop.\\" RoboCop: Prime Directives Thirteen years after the first RoboCop was activated, OCP revives the RoboCop Program yet again. After the death of Delta City Security Commander John T. Cable, OCP uses portions of his body to create Crime Prevention Unit 002, moving back to the original elements of Morton's RoboCop Program. In a move of Corporate Espionage, this new RoboCop is activated in an attempt to eliminate his predecessor so that the conglomerate could freely participate in questionable activities. This programming is later overcome by Cable, who OCP had not remembered was a former friend, and partner, of Alex Murphy, and the two instead moved against OCP.RoboCop: Prime Directives (2000) RoboCop (2014) RoboCop as portrayed by Joel Kinnaman in the 2014 remake. In this reboot of the series, Alex Murphy and his partner, Jack Lewis, are attempting to arrest crime lord Antoine Vallon, unaware that he has contacts inside the department. When Lewis gets shot and is hospitalized after an undercover deal goes wrong, Murphy is badly injured when Vallon detonates a car bomb in his driveway; a subsequent medical evaluation states that Murphy has third-degree burns over eighty percent of his body, serious spinal damage left him paralysed from the waist down, his left arm and leg had to be amputated, serious damage to the optical nerves in his left eye left him blind in that eye, and he was likely to be deaf. Faced with this damage, Murphy's wife agrees for him to be made part of the new Robocop program as part of a campaign by OmniCorp's Director, Raymond Sellars, to overturn the Dreyfus Act, which prevents robots being used for law enforcement purposes in American streets, by putting a human in the robotic body. Murphy is virtually completely reconstructed with a \\"full-body\\" cybernetic humanoid chassis; his face, central nervous systems, circulatory systems and respiratory systems are the largest part of him left intact, along with his right hand, but various chips have been implanted into his brain, as well as at least one eye being replaced, along with the rest of his body. However, he proves to operate at a slower rate than the drone counterparts in field simulations due to his natural hesitation when making judgements in the field. Attempting to get around this, Dr. Norton, the cyberneticist responsible for creating Murphy's implants, has a new chip installed in Murphy's brain that compensates for this by taking control of his responses in action. When faced with his public debut, Murphy is so overwhelmed by his emotions that Dr. Norton is forced to shut down Murphy's ability to feel emotions to prevent a psychological breakdown. With his emotions shut down, Murphy proves to be an effective detective and police officer, quickly tracking down assorted unarrested suspects through his access to various security systems. His inability to emotionally connect results in him avoiding contact with his wife Clara and son David. When Clara confronts Murphy about his distance, it causes the reversal of the effects of Dr. Norton's emotion augmentation, prompting Murphy to track down Vallon and his police contacts, effectively solving his own murder, only to be shut down when he attempts to force a confession out of the police chief after learning that she was one of Vallon's contacts. When Sellars attempts to use this discovery of police corruption to have RoboCops put in action on a country-wide scale and destroy the original, Norton has a crisis of conscience and not only reactivates Murphy, but admits what was done to him psychologically during the program. With the death of Sellars, Murphy is reconstructed by Norton and allowed contact with his family again. Characteristics Police officer Alex Murphy is serving with the Detroit Police Department when its funding and administration is taken over by the private corporation, Omni Consumer Products (OCP).RoboCop (1987) Murphy is a devout Irish Catholic and a mild-mannered family man, living with his wife, Ellen (Nancy in the television series, Clara in the 2014 remake), and his son, Jimmy (James Daniel \\"Jimmy\\" Murphy in RoboCop: The Series (see ep. 06, \\"Zone Five\\"), David in the 2014 remake).RoboCop 2 (1990) Murphy starts mimicking his son's television hero, T.J. Lazer, by twirling his gun whenever he took down a criminal. Murphy's psychological profile states that he was top of his class at the police academy and possesses a fierce sense of duty. This dedication explains why Murphy exhibits none of the negative attitudes and statements shared by his fellow officers when he is transferred to the Metro West Precinct, the most violent area of Old Detroit. The police dissatisfaction is the result of OCP's deliberate mismanagement, and penny-pinching, which led to the deaths of many police officers in the precinct. Police file Alex Murphy's police file (from the first RoboCop film) reads as follows: Alex Murphy's police file (from RoboCop: The Series, in episode, Prime Suspect) reads as follows: Prime directives RoboCop is programmed to follow three main \\"prime directives\\" (accompanied by a mysterious fourth) based on the \\"To Protect and to Serve\\" motto of the Los Angeles Police Department and many other police forces, and which are comparable with Isaac Asimov's \\"Three Laws of Robotics\\". ;Depiction in original trilogy The First Directive is the moral directive programmed: it establishes RoboCop as a police civil servant in the series who assumes a subservient contract of \\"public's trust\\", and thereby considered public property. The Second and Third Directives must not conflict with the First Directive; if there is conflict then the First Directive overrides the Second and Third Directives (except the Fourth Directive). RoboCop must help the civilians in any ways possible; and must protect their civil rights to life, privacy, and property from any lethal or non-lethal harm. This disables him from prosecuting, arresting, trespassing or harming innocent civilians without a warrant or probable cause, or act in any way against the public's trust. In RoboCop 3 when he was chasing McDaggett, he had to stop when several children blocked the road in order to prevent any harm. If he detects innocent bystanders, his fellow officers or criminals of minor misdemeanors are attacked or threatened; it then activates the Second Directive and Third Directive. The Second Directive is the ethical directive programmed: it establishes Robocop must exercise reverence for life, de- escalation, duty to intercede, duty to rescue, non-lethality and the presumption of innocence at all times. The Second Directive must not conflict with the First Directive; if there is conflict then the First Directive overrides the Second Directive. Lethal-force is authorized only during life- threatening situations, and only against criminals with a history of serious felonies (i.e. murder). In RoboCop 2, Robocop could not shoot Hob in self- defense by virtue of being a minor; this activated the Second Directive, as children are automatically assumed to be innocent. The Third Directive is the legal directive programmed: it establishes RoboCop as a law enforcement officer, with power of arrest, the legitimized use of force, and is obligated to \\"protect and serve\\" as required by law. The Third Directive must not conflict with the First or Second Directives; if there is conflict then the First or Second Directive overrides the Third Directive. It also forbids strike action or to request termination of employment, and disables him from directly assaulting, arresting, resisting, impreding or harming a police officer. In RoboCop, this is specifically what prevents Murphy from killing Boddicker during a drug raid: while Boddicker had been shooting at RoboCop minutes before, he then put his gun away and tried to flee, but RoboCop caught up with him and started severely beating him (based on echoes of memory of what Boddicker did to Murphy). The badly wounded and now unarmed Boddicker begs for his life, pleads that he surrenders, and that RoboCop can't kill him because he's a police officer ‚Äì which activates the Third Directive, making Robocop take him in alive back to the police precinct. The Fourth Directive is Jones' contribution to RoboCop's psychological profile, deliberately programmed as \\"hidden\\" and is inaccessible by RoboCop. The Fourth Directive must not conflict with the First, Second, or Third Directives; if there is conflict then the Fourth Directive overrides all previous directives. This directive renders him physically incapable of arresting or injuring any senior OCP employee: \\"Any attempt to arrest a senior OCP employee results in shutdown\\". Jones informs RoboCop that he is an OCP product and private property; not an ordinary police officer. As a result, RoboCop is effectively a slave, unable to act against the corrupt Jones until the Old Man terminates Jones's employment with the company, allowing RoboCop to act against him. Throughout the franchise, the Fourth Directive is depicted as frequently undermining and/or conflicting with the previous three directives. Senior OCP employees are technically \\"untouchable\\", as the company legally owns both Robocop and all administrative branches of government within the City of Detroit; they are a corporatocracy free to operate above the law without consequence. The Fourth Directive has been erased twice, in each of the sequels. RoboCop 2 sees the deletion of all of the directives; after Dr. Faxx has RoboCop reprogrammed with so many new irrelevant directives that he is nearly incapable of taking action, RoboCop is forced to subject himself to high voltage electricity to clear his database. In RoboCop 3, Directive Four is declassified and reworded as \\"Never oppose an OCP officer.\\" It is eliminated so that RoboCop could avenge Lewis's death. ;Other depiction In RoboCop: Prime Directives, Directive Four was not present at all, but a saboteur instituted one which is stated as \\"Terminate John T. Cable.\\" In RoboCop: The Series, Directive Four was also not present.RoboCop: The Series (1994) At the end of Prime Directives, all his directives were erased, but RoboCop stated to his son that he would do \\"What I do: Serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law,\\" noting that he would keep his directives by his own free will, not through the imposition of programming. In the 2014 film, there is no reference to the Directives, but Murphy, like the drones, is programmed to protect 'red assets' in the form of individuals wearing coded bracelets identifying themselves as assets who must be protected, with the result that he is initially unable to shoot or arrest men who are genuinely threats to him without his cybernetic systems shutting down, although he is able to override this program at the end when the OmniCorp CEO threatens to shoot his wife and son. Technology Robocop carries guns designed for him and is equipped with enhanced reflexes, speed and strength, visual and auditory capabilities. RoboCop holstering weapon * Auto-9 ‚Äì RoboCop's primary weapon; it is a 9mm handgun with a large barrel extension that fires in three-round bursts.Flesh and Steel: Making RoboCop on the 20th Anniversary Edition DVD The sidearm is stored in a mechanical holster which opens out of RoboCop's right thigh. The prop for the weapon is a modified Beretta 93R. Though unnamed in the films, The Series referred to the Auto-9 by name and added that the main version of the weapon was modified so that no one but RoboCop could actually fire it.RoboCop: The Series episode, \\"Prime Suspect\\" (1994) In Prime Directives, it could fire various types of ammunition which RoboCop could select at any given time. * Cobra Assault Cannon ‚Äì The Cobra Assault Cannon used in RoboCop could fire explosive rounds equivalent to that of a grenade launcher and is based on the Barrett M82A1 anti-materiel rifle. * Machine gun/rocket launcher ‚Äì This weapon made its appearance in RoboCop 3 and was never referenced by name other than being called a \\"weapon arm\\" in promotional action figures, and a \\"gun arm\\" by the production team. To use it, RoboCop removes his left hand and replaces it with the weapon assembly. It contains a 9mm Calico M960, a flamethrower and a small missile launcher with a projectile potent enough to destroy an armored vehicle. * Flightpack/recharging station ‚Äì A large jetpack that allows RoboCop to fly. It also doubles as a replenishing system for when RoboCop's battery system is low on power. As seen in RoboCop 3, the jetpack allows Murphy to overcome his relatively limited mobility for tactical advantage in combat. Referred to in the film as a \\"flightpack\\" and by production as a \\"jetpack,\\" some Japanese schematics also mention \\"Gyropack\\" as a name. * Mini-gun/cannon ‚Äì This weapon appears in Frank Miller's RoboCop comic book and was originally meant to be RoboCop's arm cannon prior to the final product in * Data spike ‚Äì RoboCop's data spike is a sharp, spike-like device that protrudes from Robocop's right fist. This device can be used by Robocop to interface with a corresponding data port in order to download information from the police database and compare information he's gathered from his missions with the police database. Not actually a weapon, this device was also used to neutralize Clarence Boddicker; having pinned RoboCop under a pile of scrap metal, the cyborg stabbed Boddicker in the throat, killing the crime lord. The spike does not make an appearance in the second, but it is used by RoboCop in the third film to access the OCP mainframe where he finds that a young girl's parents have been eliminated. It also appears regularly throughout RoboCop: The Series. * Explosives ‚Äì In RoboCop: The Series, unidentified explosive devices were equipped in Robocop's left thigh holster, and adhere to metallic surfaces. When armed, they can be detonated by weapons-fire, and are used primarily to remove barricades and other obstacles. * Ramset/Rambolt ‚Äì In RoboCop: The Series, RoboCop came with a Ramset/Rambolt function, wherein he can anchor himself to the spot by deploying a pair of retractable bolts out of the bottom of each foot. When anchored in place, RoboCop is able to stop a colliding car in its tracks. While this function is called 'Ramset' in its first two appearances, in ep. #03 \\"Officer Missing\\", & #04 \\"What Money Can't Buy\\", in all its following appearances it is called 'Rambolt'. Perception RoboCop's vision has an internal zoom capability for better aim as well as tracking. RoboCop also has different vision modes but the only one that has been used in the movies was thermal vision in RoboCop and RoboCop 3. His systems use a grid which is crucial to RoboCop's targeting as well as bullet trajectory (allowing him to make ricochet shots), though apparently the targeting reticle of RoboCop is internal to him, as seen in the first movie. As seen in RoboCop 2, RoboCop's programming prevents him from targeting children, which allowed Hob to shoot RoboCop and escape the Nuke drug lab. He also has a recorder which can detect voice fluctuations and stress as well as play back audio/visual. This recording capability enables RoboCop to document any situation he encounters with perfect recall and unbiased neutrality, with his memory being deemed through legal agreement as admissible evidence in a court of law. As seen in RoboCop 2, RoboCop possesses a directional microphone with which he can track conversations from a distance. It would seem to be very sensitive, as he can hear vehicles approaching from afar despite being indoors (as he did when he was hiding out in RoboCop 3). In the television series, he is capable of lie detection by means of a polygraph. In the reboot film, his vision is greatly enhanced: His visor comes down when in attack mode, and is usually up when in sentry mode. He uploaded the entire database of the Detroit PD in the visor, allowing him to instantly spot criminals in the crowd (as shown during a demonstration, where he spotted a criminal and arrested him). He also has an internal microphone allowing him to speak directly with OmniCorp officials. Body structure Various displays and interpretations range from RoboCop being mostly electronic and mechanical, while others depict his structure as balanced between the two. In the original print of the film, director Verhoeven recorded the death scene, in which crime lord Clarence Boddicker shoots Murphy in the head at point blank range, blowing out the complete rear right side of Murphy's head. This would necessitate the computer running RoboCop, with Murphy's only partial brain interacting with the computer. This scene and successive conflict structure was removed from the original release, though the back head explosion scene and destructive showing of Murphy's head is included in most successive home releases as a deleted scene. In the released theatrical version and original VHS home releases, only the front of Murphy's head and the entry wound are shown (visible when RoboCop removes his helmet in the final act). Alex Murphy's brain, nervous system and personality apparently remain intact; he is able to fully reassert himself after most of the external controlling systems are destroyed and punctuated at the end of the film, where he states his identity as \\"Murphy\\" rather than RoboCop. While all of Murphy's limbs have been replaced with \\"total body prosthesis\\" (as indicated with the scene where Murphy's left arm is announced as salvaged) Murphy's nervous system is maintained. The first movie lets the viewer assume that some of Murphy's organs were transplanted into the cyborg (without clearly stating which ones and to which extent), since he needs to feed on a \\"rudimentary paste that sustains his organic systems\\". Donald Johnson (played by Felton Perry) comments Robocop's paste \\"tastes like baby food\\". RoboCop's reconstructed external structure is protected by an armored shell composed of \\"titanium laminated with Kevlar\\" making RoboCop incredibly resilient against both bombs and bullets, as well as extreme impacts such as being hit by cars and falling off skyscrapers. In RoboCop and RoboCop 3 the body armor is gray, and in RoboCop 2 the armor is blue. RoboCop's hands, midsection, and neck armor are black. As demonstrated in RoboCop, the body armor can sustain thousands of armor-piercing rounds before damage begins to appear on the armor. It is also highly resistant to heat, as in RoboCop, he was unaffected after being caught in a gasoline station explosion and in RoboCop 3 when he was briefly set aflame. His visor is made of the same material and a black strip of bulletproof anti-fog glass which protects the cranium apparatus and eyes. The visor also has an undercloth of Kevlar which protects the neck and covers up any wires etc. It should also be noted that the visor conceals most of Alex Murphy's face, and is attached with screws. When the visor is removed, only Murphy's face (which is grafted onto a completely mechanical skull) from the top of the neck up is exposed.RoboCop: Creating a Legend (RoboCop 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition) When the helmet is removed, the back of his head exposes part of the metal casing and some minor mechanical elements. In RoboCop 2, RoboCop's right arm contained a display that alerted personnel to his health status. RoboCop's hands also contain actuators strong enough to crush every bone in a human hand (about 400 foot pounds). His right hand also contains a spike (referred to by fans as a \\"dataspike\\" and by production as the \\"terminal strip\\") which is used to retrieve or display data from any computer bank with a corresponding port. At the end of the first film, the jack is also used as a stabbing weapon against the antagonist Clarence Boddicker. RoboCop is extremely strong, able to lift the front of the average car over his head with one arm or resist the crushing effort of a car crusher, as seen in the TV series (episodes 5 and 21, respectively). He was designed to be able \\"to penetrate virtually any building,\\" and breaks locks with ease. In Frank Miller's RoboCop, RoboCop stores his reserve box magazines in his right wrist; this is never shown in the film series. He is seen reloading the Auto-9 in RoboCop 2 with a magazine already in hand at the start of the scene. In the later television series, the holster area of his left thigh is used to store grenades, though on some schematic drawings the same area is used to store an emergency oxygen tank. RoboCop implies that only Murphy's face and brain was used in the construction of RoboCop, as Morton states that \\"total body prosthesis\\" was an agreed-upon parameter. It is unclear in the first two films whether or not RoboCop's human face is merely a replica of Murphy's, as it contains a scar where Boddicker shot him in the head, though he tells Murphy's wife, in RoboCop 2, that \\"they made this to honor him.\\" After touching it, she says, \\"it's cold.\\" In RoboCop 3, Dr. Marie Lazarus, RoboCop's chief technician, stated that Murphy's face was indeed transplanted onto a mechanical skull, and that it is not a replica. In the 2014 RoboCop reboot, RoboCop is seen in several bodies. While the original film left it unclear exactly how much of Murphy's body is left after his reconstruction, this film clearly confirms that Murphy's remaining organic parts are his head, his heart, his lungs, and his right hand, and one of his eyes has been replaced with a cybernetic implant and there are various chips in his brain to compensant for the cranial trauma and help him integrate with his cybernetic components. Initially, he is constructed in a silver body very similar to the one seen in the original films. Omnicorp CEO Raymond Sellars later has marketing executive Tom Pope conduct focus group testing on a number of other designs. One such design features a transformation function, in which RoboCop could switch from his usual, bulky shape into a slimmer, more human-like form for off-duty public relations purposes. Though Sellars rejects this concept, he selects the slimmer \\"public relations\\" design as RoboCop's permanent design, albeit painted black to make him more marketable. Following Sellars' death and the significant damaging of this body, RoboCop is rebuilt in his original body by Dr. Dennett Norton. Unlike in the original films, RoboCop's head is contained within a helmet, instead of his face being transplanted onto a metal skull. One feature common in every design seen in the reboot film is that the visor, which was screwed onto RoboCop's head in the original films, can move up and down freely, commonly moving over his eyes when his emotions spike and his crimefighting programs activate. In RoboCop: Creating a Legend, a bonus feature on the RoboCop: 20th Anniversary DVD, it is stated that Murphy's face was removed from his corpse and implanted on the cyborg's head to give RoboCop a sense of identity. This psychological disruption RoboCop may have experienced is explained from the basis that a person whose memory has been erased would still possess the memory of being human and would suffer a psychotic breakdown if he saw the reflection of a robotic image instead of his original image of humanity. In other media Since his 1987 film debut, the RoboCop character and franchise have been exercised through numerous entertainment media including multiple television series, comic books, video games, and action figures. Television RoboCop has appeared in numerous television series based on the films. These include: * RoboCop appears in RoboCop: The Series played by Richard Eden. The series takes place four to five years after the original film; Murphy's mother and father were introduced. His father Russell Murphy was a devout police officer himself for many years until his retirement. He is responsible for instilling Murphy with his trademark sense of duty and dedication to law enforcement, even after his transformation into a cyborg. Throughout the series, Murphy finds himself teamed up with his father on a few cases that often saw them utilizing the elder Murphy's expertise in dealing with reappearing criminals he'd chased back before his retirement. Although his father was stern, it was clear Murphy's parents loved and cherished him even after his 'demise.' However at the end of the episode Corporate raiders, Russell Murphy finds out that it's his son under the RoboCop enhancements. Ellen (known as Nancy in the series for apparent copyright reasons) and Jimmy Murphy were recurring characters as well, often finding themselves crossing paths with Murphy by falling in inadvertently or intentionally with the criminal element to which Murphy interfered and protected them from harm. Despite his series partner Madigan's concerns to tell his family who he is, Murphy replied firmly \\"No\\" as he felt doing so would hurt them even more. He commented that \\"they need a husband... and a father. I cannot be that. But I can protect them.\\" * RoboCop appears in RoboCop: Prime Directives played by Page Fletcher. The series takes place ten years after the first film's events. RoboCop has become outdated, tired, and quasi-suicidal. Delta City (formerly Detroit) is now considered the safest place on Earth and he is no longer viewed as particularly necessary. The first half of the series focuses on Alex Murphy's former partner John T. Cable who is slain by RoboCop due to his system being hacked and being programmed to terminate Cable. Cable is then resurrected as a cyborg in most aspects identical to the RoboCop model, save for color and the addition of a second sidearm. \\"RoboCable\\" is sent to destroy RoboCop. After several battles, Cable is convinced to join Murphy. Meanwhile, OCP (on the verge of bankruptcy) is taken over by a scheming executive Damian Lowe who manages to murder the entire board of directors. To bring OCP back, he plans to use an artificial intelligence called SAINT to automate the entire city. The second half of the series introduces Dr. David Kaydick, who plans to introduce a \\"bio-tech\\" virus (Legion) to wipe out not only Delta City but all life on the planet, infecting computers and people alike. He takes control of RoboCable by planting a chip in him that causes him pain or death at Kaydick's discretion. RoboCop receives aid from a group of tech thieves led by Ann R. Key (Leslie Hope), who are determined to stop Kaydick and RoboCop's own son James - now fully grown and aware of his father's fate. RoboCop and his rag-tag band race to stop Kaydick from infiltrating OCP tower and activating SAINT, which would presumably kill almost all humans. During the confrontation, RoboCop and James reconcile with each other, and manage to rekindle RoboCable's previous personality. Ann R. Key and Kaydick both die during a confrontation with each other. Utilizing James's EMP device, and having shut down RoboCop, RoboCable and LEGION are terminated. RoboCop gets rebooted without his previous OCP restriction programming (as well as restoring his identity as \\"Alex Murphy\\" as opposed to an OCP product number) or his prime directives. After viewing a goodbye message left by Cable, Murphy returns to active duty to stop the resultant crime in Delta City due to the EMP pulse blacking out the city. * Based on the original movie, the first RoboCop animated series features cyborg cop Alex Murphy/RoboCop (voiced by Dan Hennessey), who fights to save the city of Old Detroit from assorted rogue elements, and on occasion, fights to reclaim aspects of his humanity and maintain his usefulness in the eyes of the \\"Old Man\\", Chairman of OCP. Many episodes see RoboCop's reputation put to the test or soured by interventions from Dr. McNamara, the creator of ED-260, the upgradable version of the Enforcement Droid Series 209 and the top competitor for the financial backing of OCP. He continually develops other mechanical menaces that threaten RoboCop. In the police force, RoboCop is befriended as always by Officer Anne Lewis, but is also picked on and lambasted by the prejudiced Lieutenant Roger Hedgecock (who appeared as a minor character in the original film and his first name revealed in Night of the Archer), ever determined to be rid of him and his kind, whom he sees as ticking time bombs. Their rivalry comes to a fever pitch during the episode \\"The Man in the Iron Suit,\\" in which Hedgecock comes close to finally beating Murphy with the aid of a new weapons system developed by McNamara. He almost kills Lewis when she interferes, enraging Murphy into tearing Hedgecock's iron suit apart and nearly crushing his skull before Lewis emerges, alive and well. Robocop is maintained by Robocop Project director Dr. Tyler. * RoboCop appears in RoboCop: Alpha Commando voiced by David Sobolov. The series is set in the year 2030 and deals with RoboCop being reactivated after five years offline to assist a federal high-tech group \\"Alpha Division\\" in their vigilance and struggle against DARC (Directorate for Anarchy, Revenge, and Chaos), a highly advanced terrorist organization and other forces of evil whenever that may be, globally or nationally. The series shared many of the same writers who had contributed to the 1980s animated series, but had even less in common with the movies or television canon that it was based on, including the first animated series. RoboCop now has numerous gadgets in his body that were never in the film such as roller skates and a parachute. The show also suffers from major continuity errors. In the first episodes, the viewers see RoboCop's son in his memories flashback and he appears to be around 10. The viewers later see his son in the series, to be exactly the same age and even wearing the same clothing, as his memories. The absence of Anne Lewis was never explained. Besides RoboCop himself, Sgt. Reed is the only character from the movies in the series. Unlike the movies and previous TV incarnations, RoboCop never takes off his helmet in Alpha Commando. Video games RoboCop has appeared in several video game adaptions for the films, as well as RoboCop Versus The Terminator. * RoboCop appears in a video game adaption for RoboCop. * RoboCop later appears in a video game adaption for RoboCop 2. * RoboCop also appears in a video game adaption for RoboCop 3. * RoboCop reappears in a 2003 reboot video game adaption for the original RoboCop film. * RoboCop had a tie-in video game for Android for the 2014 reboot. * RoboCop appears as a playable character in the Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath expansion pack, with Peter Weller reprising his role from the original film and RoboCop 2. In his arcade ending, RoboCop pursued Kano to the latter's universe after discovering he was supplying Old Detroit's gangs with weapons until he encountered Kronika. After defeating her and becoming the Keeper of Time, RoboCop learned about the full extent of OCP's corruption and led a task force composed of other Mortal Kombat characters to stop them. Comic books RoboCop has appeared in several different comic books. * RoboCop appears in the 23-issue Marvel series and two comic book adaptations of the film series (1987-1992). * He appears in Dark Horse comics book series (1992-1994). * He later appears in Avatar Press titles, Frank Miller's RoboCop and more (2003-2005). * He appears in Dynamite Entertainment comic book series (2010-2012). * He appears in Boom! Studios comic book series (2013-2015, 2018). Crossovers * A four-issue comic book crossover featuring RoboCop and The Terminator was published in 1992 by Dark Horse Comics. A video game loosely based on the comic was released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Nintendo Game Boy, and Sega Game Gear. It was awarded Bloodiest Game of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. An adaptation of Robocop Versus The Terminator was planned in 1995 based on Dark Horse's comic but it was later cancelled. * In WCW's PPV, Capital Combat, Robocop comes to the aid of Sting against The Four Horsemen. * The name Alex Murphy appears on a headstone in Phantasm II. Miscellaneous * A RoboCop statue will be built in Detroit after fans raised over $50,000 to fund it.Freep.com In January 2020, the Detroit Free Press reported that the statue was \\"almost finished.\\" * The video game Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which is set in the future and features a cyborg who was attacked then augmented by a megacorporation has two police officers, one called Alex Murphy, in a police station in Detroit discussing \\"That 80s movie about the cop that gets shot up\\" then one of the men turns to the player and says \\"Hey, I think we were just talking about you.\\" * In the 1995 film adaptation of The Indian in the Cupboard, main character Omri places amongst different action figures -including Darth Vader- a RoboCop action figure into the cupboard bringing them all to life.

Rock-cut architecture is the practice of creating a structure by carving it out of solid natural rock. Rock that is not part of the structure is removed until the only rock left makes up the architectural elements of the excavated interior. Indian rock-cut architecture is mostly religious in nature. There are more than 1,500 known rock-cut structures in India. Many of these structures contain artwork of global importance, and most are adorned with exquisite stone carvings. These ancient and medieval structures represent significant achievements of structural engineering and craftsmanship. The effort expended often astonishes visitors, but seen from one aspect, a rock- cut structure is a decorated rock quarry; most of the stone removed was typically put to economic use elsewhere. In India, caves have long been regarded as sacred places. Caves that were enlarged or entirely man-made were believed to be as sacred as natural caves. The sanctuary in all Indian religious structures, even free-standing ones, was designed to have the same cave-like feeling, as it is generally small and dark, without natural light. The oldest rock-cut architecture is found in the Barabar caves, Bihar, which were built around the 3rd century BC. Other early cave temples are found in the western Deccan; these are mostly Buddhist shrines and monasteries, dating between 100 BC and 170 AD. Originally, there were probably wooden structures associated with them, which would have deteriorated over time. Historically, artisans carried forward design elements from wood in their rock-cut temples: skilled craftsmen carved rock to imitate timber texture, grain, and structure. The earliest cave temples include the Bhaja Caves, the Karla Caves, the Bedse Caves, the Kanheri Caves, and some of the Ajanta Caves. Relics found in these caves suggest a connection between the religious and the commercial. Buddhist missionaries are known to have accompanied traders on the busy international trading routes through India. Some of the more sumptuous cave temples, commissioned by wealthy traders, included pillars, arches, and elaborate facades. They were made during the period when maritime trade boomed between the Roman Empire and south-east Asia. Although free-standing structural temples were being built by the 5th century, rock-cut cave temples continued to be built in parallel. Later rock-cut cave architecture became more sophisticated, as in the Ellora Caves. The monolithic Kailash Temple is considered to be the peak of this type construction. Although cave temples continued to be built until the 12th century, rock-cut architecture became almost totally structural in nature. That is, rocks were cut into bricks and used to build free-standing structures. Kailash was the last spectacular rock- cut excavated temple. Numerous rock reliefs, relief sculptures carved into rock faces, have been found outside caves or at other sites. New discoveries of relatively small rock-cut sites, mostly Buddhist, continue to be made in the 21st century, especially in the Deccan. Early natural caves Saptaparni Cave, a retreat of the Buddha. The earliest caves used by humans were natural caves that they occupied or used for a variety of purposes, such as shrines and shelters. Evidence suggests that the caves were first occupied and slightly altered during the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods, up to about 6000 BC. These changes are not classified as architecture. Early examples included decorating overhanging rock with rock-cut designs. The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, now designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, are located on the edge of the Deccan Plateau, where dramatic erosion has left massive sandstone outcrops. Researchers have found primitive tools and decorative rock paintings made by humans in the area's many caves and grottos, the earliest paintings dating to circa 8,000 BCE. During the time of the Buddha (c. 563/480 or c. 483/400 BCE), Buddhist monks were also in the habit of using natural caves, such as the Saptaparni Cave, southwest from Rajgir, Bihar. Many believe it to be the site in which Buddha spent some time before his death,Digha Nikaya 16, Maha-Parinibbana Sutta, Last Days of the Buddha, Buddhist Publication Society and where the first Buddhist council was held after the Buddha died (paranirvana). The Buddha himself had also used the Indrasala Cave for meditation, starting a tradition of using caves, natural or man-made, as religious retreats, that would last for over a millennium.Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, p.97-99 Artificial caves of Eastern India (3rd‚Äì2nd centuries BCE) In the 3rd century BCE Indian rock-cut architecture began to develop, starting with the already highly sophisticated and state-sponsored Barabar caves in Bihar, personally dedicated by Ashoka circa 250 BCE.Chandra, Pramod (2008), South Asian arts, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. These artificial caves exhibit an amazing level of technical proficiency, the extremely hard granite rock being cut in geometrical fashion and polished to a mirror-like finish. There is another cave with the structure and polishing qualities of the Barabar caves, but without any inscription. This is the Sitamarhi Cave, 20 km from Rajgir, 10 km south-west of Hisua, also dated of the Maurya empire. It is smaller than the Barabar caves, measuring only 4.91x3.43m, with a ceiling height of 2.01m. The entrance is also trapezoidal, as for the Barabar caves.Gupta, The roots of Indian Art, p.194- Finally, the Jain Son Bhandar Caves in Rajgir, generally dated to the 2nd‚Äì4th centuries CE, nevertheless share a broad structure reminiscent of the caves of Barabar and some small areas of irregular polish, which leads some authors to suggest that they may actually be contemporary to, and even earlier than, the Barabar caves, and would conveniently create a precedent and an evolutionary step to the Barabar Caves. To the southeast of Bihar, the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, partly natural and partly artificial caves were built near the city of Bhubaneswar in Odisha, India. The caves are situated on two adjacent hills, Udayagiri and Khandagiri, mentioned as Kumari Parvat in the Hathigumpha inscription. They have a number of finely and ornately carved caves built during 2nd century BCE. It is believed that most of these caves were carved out as residential blocks for Jain monks during the reign of King Kharavela. Udayagiri means \\"Sunrise Hill\\" and has 18 caves while Khandagiri has 15 caves.

Artificial caves of Western India After the Barabar Caves, huge efforts were made at building religious caves in Western India until the 6th century CE. However, the polishing of cave walls was abandoned, never to be revived. Such grandiose caves as Karla Caves (1st century CE) or the Ajanta Caves (5th century CE) do not have any polishing either. This may be due to the fact that Mauryan caves were dedicated and sponsored by the Mauryan Imperial government, allowing for huge resources and efforts to be spent, whereas later caves where essentially the result of donations by commoners, who could not afford as high a level of spending.Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist architecture, p.99 First wave of construction (2nd century BCE‚Äì4th century CE) The Great Chaitya in the Karla Caves, Maharashtra, India, 1st-century CE. Probably owing to the 2nd century BCE fall of the Mauryan Empire and the subsequent persecutions of Buddhism under Pushyamitra Sunga, it is thought that many Buddhists relocated to the Deccan under the protection of the Andhra dynasty, thus shifting the cave-building effort to western India: an enormous effort at creating religious caves (usually Buddhist or Jain) continued there until the 2nd century CE, culminating with the Karla Caves or the Pandavleni Caves. These caves generally followed an apsidal plan with a stupa in the back for the chaityas, and a rectangular plan with surrounding cells for the viharas. When Buddhist missionaries arrived, they naturally gravitated to caves for use as temples and abodes, in accord with their religious ideas of asceticism and the monastic life. The Western Ghats topography, with its flat- topped basalt hills, deep ravines, and sharp cliffs, was suited to their cultural inclinations. The earliest of the Kanheri Caves were excavated in the 1st and 2nd centuries B.C., as were those at Ajanta, which were occupied continuously by Buddhist monks from 200 BCE to 650 AD. As the Buddhist ideology encouraged involvement in trade, monasteries often became stopovers for inland traders and provided lodging houses along trade routes. As mercantile and royal endowments grew, cave interiors became more elaborate, with interior walls decorated in paintings, reliefs, and intricate carvings. Numerous donors provided the funds for the building of these caves and left donatory inscriptions, including laity, members of the clergy, government officials, and even foreigners such as Yavanas (Greeks) representing about 8% of all inscriptions.Buddhist architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, p.98-99 Facades were added to the exteriors while the interiors became designated for specific uses, such as monasteries (viharas) and worship halls (chaityas). Over the centuries, simple caves began to resemble free-standing buildings, needing to be formally designed and requiring highly skilled artisans and craftsmen to complete. These artisans had not forgotten their timber roots and imitated the nuances of a wooden structure and the wood grain in working with stone. Early examples of rock-cut architecture are the Buddhist and Jain cave basadi, temples and monasteries, many with gavakshas (chandrashalas). The ascetic nature of these religions inclined their followers to live in natural caves and grottos in the hillsides, away from the cities, and these became enhanced and embellished over time. Although many temples, monasteries, and stupas had been destroyed, by contrast, cave temples are very well preserved as they are both less visible and therefore less vulnerable to vandalism as well as made of more durable material than wood and masonry. There are around 1200 cave temples still in existence, most of which are Buddhist. The residences of monks were called Viharas and the cave shrines, called Chaityas, were for congregational worship. The earliest rock- cut garbhagriha, similar to free-standing ones later, had an inner circular chamber with pillars to create a circumambulatory path (pradakshina) around the stupa and an outer rectangular hall for the congregation of the devotees.

Second wave of cave construction (5th‚Äì6th century CE) Cave 26 in Ajanta, circa 480 CE. The construction of caves would wane after the 2nd century CE, possibly due to the rise of Mahayana Buddhism and the associated intense architectural and artistic production in Gandhara and Amaravati. The building of rock-cut caves would revive briefly in the 6th century CE, with the magnificent achievements of Ajanta and Ellora, before finally subsiding as Hinduism replaced Buddhism in the sub-continent, and stand-alone temples became more prevalent. The Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra, a World Heritage Site, are 30 rock-cut cave Buddhist temples carved into the sheer vertical side of a gorge near a waterfall-fed pool located in the hills of the Sahyadri mountains. Like all the locations of Buddhist caves, this one is located near main trade routes and spans six centuries beginning in the 2nd or 1st century B.C. A period of intense building activity at this site occurred under the Vakataka king Harisena between 460 and 478 A profuse variety of decorative sculpture, intricately carved columns and carved reliefs are found, including exquisitely carved cornices and pilaster. Skilled artisans crafted living rock to imitate timbered wood (such as lintels) in construction and grain and intricate decorative carving, although such architectural elements were ornamental and not functional in the classical sense. Later many Hindu kings from southern India patronize many cave temples dedicated to Hindu gods and goddesses. One such prominent example of cave temple architecture are the Badami Cave Temples at Badami, the early Chalukya capital, carved out in the 6th century. There are four cave temples hewn from the sides of cliffs, three Hindu and one Jain, that contain carved architectural elements such as decorative pillars and brackets as well as finely carved sculpture and richly etched ceiling panels. Nearby are many small Buddhist cave shrines. Cave 26, Ajanta.jpg|The Ajanta Caves are 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monument built under the Vakatakas.

Ellora cave34 001.jpg|Ellora Caves. Cave 34. The yakshini Ambika, the yakshini of Neminath at a Jain Cave at Ellora Rock-cut architecture also developed with the apparition of stepwells in India, dating from 200‚Äì400 CE. Subsequently, the construction of wells at Dhank (550‚Äì625 CE) and stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850‚Äì950 CE) took place.Livingston & Beach, xxiii Final wave of cave construction (6th‚Äì15th century CE) At Ellora, on the hill to the northeast of the main complex of caves, is a Jain cave temple containing a rock-carved image of Lord Parshvanath with an inscription dated 1234/5 CE. This well preserved image is flanked by Dharaƒ±endra and Padmavati, is still under active worship. The inscription mentions the site as Charana Hill, a holy site.Lisa Nadine Owen, Beyond Buddhist and Brahmanical Activity: The Place of the Jain Rock-Cut Excavations at Ellora, PhD thesis 2006, University of Texas at Austin p. 255 This was the last excavation at Ellora. The Ankai Fort caves are thought to be from the same period. The final wave of Indian rock-cut cave construction occurred at Gwalior with five clusters of rock-cut monuments surrounding the Gwalior fort, two centuries after the Ellora Parshvantha cave temple. They contain many monumental Jain images.

Babur, who visited Gwalior in AD 1527, ordered the Gwalior statues to be destroyed.Gwalior Fort: Rock Sculptures, A Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, pages 364-370 However, only the faces of many of colossal Jain images were destroyed, some of them were later repaired by the local Jains.

A feature of the rock-cut cave temple distribution until the time of the early Pallavas is that they did not move further south than Arakandanallur, with the solitary exception of Tiruchitrapalli on the south bank of the Kaveri River, the traditional southern boundary between north and south. Also, good granite exposures for rock-cut structures were generally not available south of the river. A rock cut temple is carved from a large rock and excavated and cut to imitate a wooden or masonry temple with wall decorations and works of art. Pancha Rathas is an example of monolith Indian rock cut architecture dating from the late 7th century located at Mamallapuram, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ellora cave temple 16, the Kailash Temple, is singular in that it was excavated from the top down rather than by the usual practice of carving into the scarp of a hillside. The Kailash Temple was created through a single, huge top-down excavation 100 feet deep down into the volcanic basaltic cliff rock. It was commissioned in the 8th century by King Krishna I and took more than 100 years to complete. The Kailash Temple, or cave 16 as it is known at Ellora Caves located at Maharashtra on the Deccan Plateau, is a huge monolithic temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. There are 34 caves built at this site, but the other 33 caves, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, were carved into the side of the plateau rock. The effect of the Kailash Temple is that of a free-standing temple surrounded by smaller cave shrines carved out of the same black rock. The Kailash Temple is carved with figures of gods and goddesses from the Hindu Puranas, along with mystical beings like the heavenly nymphs and musicians and figures of good fortune and fertility. Ellora Caves is also a World Heritage Site. There is no timeline that divides the creation of rock-cut temples and free-standing temples built with cut stone as they developed in parallel. The building of free-standing structures, especially Buddhist temples, began in the 3rd century BCE, whereas Hindu temples started to be built from the 5th century CE.Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, p.233-235 Meanwhile, rock cut temples continued to be excavated until the 12th century. Stepwells Chand Baori, Abhaneri near Bandikui, Rajasthan, is one of the deepest and largest stepwells in India The stepwell is a large hole in the ground with steps at one or more sides. They are used in India to collect and conserve water from the monsoon rains, for use in the dry season. The steps allow access to the water whatever level it is at. They have a history of around 4,000 years in India, first appearing in the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization, reappearing around the 5th century CE, and then constructed until relatively recent times, with some still in use. Many have walls lined with stone brought from elsewhere for the purpose, but many are truly rock-cut. The most elaborate are highly decorated. They are mostly found in drier states such as Gujarat and Rajasthan.Beach, Milo, Steps to Water: The Ancient Stepwells of India, (Photographs by Morna Livingston), 2002, Princeton Architectural Press, , 9781568983240, google books Famous examples include: Chand Baori, Rani ki vav, Step-well of Ambapur, and the Dada Harir Stepwell.

There are three, much modified, railway stations. The very diverse domestic architecture comprises 19th- century mansions, villas and tenements, and sheltered and nursing homes constructed from Victorian public buildings. Extensive 20th- and 21st-century housing estates include private and social housing and range from small terraces to high rise flats. The 1960s town centre has recently been redeveloped.

New Testament Greek ‚Äòclassical style‚Äô typical of Baptist churches, with an ‚Äòingeniously planned‚Äô Memorial Hall at the rear (1932, by Millar and Black). * Cambuslang Flemington Hallside Church (1885, with halls of 1929) in simple lancet style. Located close to Halfway. * Cambuslang Old Parish Church (1839‚Äì41, by David Cousin; chancel rebuilt in 1919‚Äì22 to plans drawn up before the First World War in 1913 by MacGregor Chalmers; War Memorial 1921 by MacGregor Chalmers; Halls 1895‚Äì97 by A Lindsay Miller, extended 1968). This is the successor to the original and subsequent parish churches, with some memory of its medieval predecessors in its Transitional style, if a bit ‚ÄòEnglish‚Äô in perspective. A stone inscribed ‚ÄòAMT 1626‚Äô inside the spire may be a relic of the first post-reformation kirk. The arms the Heritors are displayed on the walls of the kirk, with those of the Duke of Hamilton, as chief Heritor, appearing a dozen times. The current decorative scheme dates from 1957‚Äì58 includes stained glass windows (by Sadie McLellan) showing the Life and Works of St Cadoc, Christ as Head of the Church, symbols of the Passion and Angels. Tapestries, also by McLellan, include an Angus Dei, Burning Bush. The organ of 1896 is by Abbot & Smith of Leeds and was rebuilt in 1968 by Conacher and Co of Huddersfield. The bell is inscribed MIH 1612 (for John Houston, a heritor) and CH (Charles Hogg, an Edinburgh bell-founder). Located in the Kirkhill district of the town. * St Andrews Church of Scotland (1961‚Äì66, by Beveridge & Dallachy). This was part of the new town centre ‚Äòwith many popular mannerisms‚Äô. In one courtyard is a relief of 'Christ and St Andrew' (by Thomas Wallen, who also designed the font and chancel pavement). The furnishings and stained glass windows are 19th- century relics from the demolished Rosebank and West Parish churches. The organ is by Compton. * St Bride‚Äôs Catholic Church is a small church of 1902, possibly on the site of a medieval chapel dedicated to Our Lady.

The school was rebuilt in the 2010s. *St. Charles Primary School in Newton was demolished and rebuilt in a new location (several hundred yards further up Westburn road) in the 2010s. The original building followed the same wooden-fronted architecture as the first buildings in Westburn village. Public buildings Cambuslang Institute *Cambuslang Institute was erected 1892-98, by A Lindsay Miller; extended in 1906 and 1910. Interior modernised in 1978‚Äì83. It carries on the work started by 19th-century weavers and miners determined to educate themselves. *Cambuslang Public Library ‚Äì a county council erection by John Stewart in 1936‚Äì38 ‚Äì ‚Äòone long range with stripped classical detail‚Äô. Now closed and demolished (April 2007). *Health Institute (1926, by John Stewart, Lanarkshire County Council architect). It is similar in style to his other buildings if a little more domestic. *New town centre (completed in 1965) replaced all of the northern half of the Main Street with a new shopping precinct and residences set below and further back than the original tenements, allowing the road to be widened.Buildings of Scotland: Glasgow (page 504), Elizabeth Williamson, Anne Riches, Malcolm Higgs, 1990, It had a fine sunken public square in a modernist style, approached by heated ramps and featuring a pond with fountains. Surrounding this were two storeys of shops, the upper levels having their own elevated walkway. The whole of this precinct was connected to the older southern half of the Main Street by two pedestrian subways at the east and west ends. Masionette-style flats were situated above these shops, while the larger slab-style Kyle Court high rise flats were situated to the east. More brutalist grey residential tower blocks were built further to the west.The Story of Rosebank Tower, Tower Blocks UK, 16 September 2019 The central section of this development, incorporating the elevated shops with maisonette flats above, was demolished circa 2004, and the eastern pedestrian subway, located near Greenlees Road, was filled in. The replacement development includes local offices for South Lanarkshire Council and Cambuslang Public Library, as well as shop units directly on the Main Street with flats above. As of 2017, however, some of these shop units have failed to find long-term tenants. A small plaque marks the 2001 renovation of the pedestrian precinct, featuring new landscaping and a mural depicting key scenes and figures in the town's history. Domestic architecture *Social housing is pleasant and varied ‚Äì cottage-flats 'fit for heroes' (1920s); Art Deco brick trim on whitened render (1930s); modernist (1950s and 60s) and brutalist (1960s and 70s). *Suburban villas in various styles, but mostly standard Scottish Victorian (with a hint of the Italianate). *Classic Scottish tenements in honey-coloured and red sandstone. *Police Barracks (1911, converted into sheltered housing in 1982) has an attractive 17th-century doorcase enclosing the arms of Lanarkshire Constabulary. *Cambuslang Public School (1882‚Äì83, by A Lindsay Miller; later an annex of Cambuslang College of the Building Trades; presently a nursing home). Has a decorative fa√ßade of Tudor-Gothic style, and plainer extensions of pre-1910 nearby. Now a nursing home. Leisure buildings * Cambuslang Bowling Club, founded in 1874 when the suburb was laid out, has a classical gateway and pavilion with a miniature Baronial tower (all of which may be later). * Cambuslang Royal Arch Lodge, No.114, is a fine, red sandstone building at 11-13, Tabernacle Lane, dating to 1904. It is home to a Masonic lodge which was founded in 1769, and which formerly had a lodge hall in Kirkhill, South Lanarkshire. Cinemas *The Savoy Cinema was built in 1929 for a local company primarily with facilities for theatre use. The architect was John Fairweather, who was the house architect for the Green's cinema chain, although this particular cinema did not initially have any link with that chain. Fairweather was responsible for designing the two largest cinemas built in Britain, the Green‚Äôs Playhouses in Dundee and Glasgow. Fairweather's influences were more neo-classical than art deco, and his cinema interiors, including the Cambuslang Savoy, usually had giant columns along the sidewalls. The classical, monumental facade is a landmark on the Main Street, and was for many years a rather garish shade of yellow. It became a bingo hall around the early 1960s, and was renamed Vogue, although it has since reverted to the Savoy name. The building was run by an independent bingo company, the interior is relatively unspoiled. The building is now transformed into a Wetherspoon's pub, named The John Fairweather and was externally repainted November 2014, and opened February 2015. The building has been restored, maintaining original features, and now functions as a classic backdrop, to a modern pub and restaurant.Cambuslang Wetherspoons: John Fairweather's grandson gives revamped building the thumbs-upThe John Fairweather *The Empire was on the corner of Hamilton Road and Clydeford Road, next to the former gas works, between St Andrew's Church and the bus terminus. The exact opening and closing dates of this cinema are not known, but it seems likely it dates from around the 1920s and was closed as a cinema in the 1950s or 1960s. The building remained in increasing dereliction until demolition around 1986. *The Ritz cinema was built for the ABC chain in 1930 on the site of the current Spar shop. It was designed by William Beresford Inglis, the architect and businessman who later designed and ran the Beresford Hotel in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street. The Ritz was unusual in that it was an atmospheric cinema, a particular type of design that Beresford specialised in ‚Äì this meant that the auditorium created the impression of sitting in an outdoor setting, with an open sky above and pseudo-3D buildings along the sidewalls. Inglis generally created these with a Spanish theme, and the Ritz followed this by having its entrance in the form of a large white archway. It was a short-lived cinema, and was closed and demolished in 1960. The Ritz Bar is named after it, and occupies a corner of the site where it once stood. Industrial buildings * Rosebank Dyeworks (1881 until 1945) banded with Greek key pattern in white brick on red and visually very striking, with a double pitched roof and bell turret. * Hoover factory (1946 and later) was large and modern and emptied in the late 2000s, with housing built on the site a decade later.Two towns slug it out on the jobs see-saw: Dijon and Cambuslang once shared an employer. Now one's gain is the other's loss.

In the early 21st century there is a large supermarket on the Cambuslang side of the bridges, and on the other side is the ancient village of Carmyle, which is administered by the City of Glasgow. Orion/Rosebank Bridge The earliest crossing over the river (other than informal fords at crossing points which were unsafe when the water levels rose) was a 19th- century wooden mineral railway bridge. It was constructed in the 1850s and named Orion Bridge in commemoration of a naval tragedy involving a paddle steamer of that name which had occurred a few years earlier. The bridge was also known as Rosebank Bridge after Rosebank House, the nearby mansion on the Cambuslang side.Rosebank House, The Glasgow StoryCambuslang Bridge (Rosebank Bridge) at Gazetteer for Scotland For a time the Dunlop Family, operators of the Clyde Iron Works around a mile to the north on the opposite side of the river, were also the owners of Rosebank House, explaining the reason for the desire to link the sites. The private railway linked the iron works to the main Clydesdale Junction Railway lines and also provided a source of fuel from local collieries. The Orion connection would appear to stem from the fact that another previous owner of Rosebank, shipping magnate Sir George Burns, had a brother who died in the Orion incident.Old Country Houses of Glasgow ‚Äì Rosebank The wooden bridge eventually burned down in a fire in 1919, by which time the iron works were linked to the closer Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway lines and most of the local coal had been exhausted.Ian Cormack: Cambuslang In Old Picture Postcards, Article 41 Cambuslang/Orion Bridge Cambuslang 'Orion' Bridge as seen from footbridge Cambuslang Bridge which has been referred to as Clyde BridgeIan Cormack: Cambuslang In Old Picture Postcards, Article 42 and later as Orion Bridge, was built in 1892 by Crouch and Hogg. It was built using the steel lattice girder structure commonly used in rail bridges of the timeRecord and images for Cambuslang Bridge at Canmore.org.uk (see Westburn Viaduct, Dalmarnock Railway Bridge 1897 in the vicinity) but historical maps do not show it ever having been used by a railway. For 80 years it carried the main road north towards Tollcross in the East End of Glasgow but weight restrictions meant it became unsuitable for such heavy use, and in 1976 a replacement was built downstream.Clydeford Bridge at Gazetteer for Scotland Vehicles continued to use the Cambuslang Bridge until 1986 when the Bogleshole Road Bridge was built around half a mile to the north. Footbridge Cambuslang Footbridge (constructed by Strathclyde Regional Council in 1977)Record and images for Cambuslang Footbridge at Canmore.org.ukCambuslang Footbridge at Gazetteer for Scotland is the point where the Clyde Walkway and the National Cycle Route 75 cross from the north to the south bank of the Clyde. In 2015 a feasibility study was conducted on creating a new cycling and walking route which would run along the south (Cambuslang) river bank to Farme Cross in Rutherglen via the Clydebridge Steelworks site. The footbridge is just downstream from the original Cambuslang Bridge, and although becoming overgrown and blocked off from vehicular traffic the older structure is still in place and can be used freely by pedestrians, meaning that for several years there have been two crossings serving the same function only a few yards from one another.

It was originally approximately 20 miles inland from the mouth of the San Francisco Bay near Vallejo, California. History The first lighthouse to mark the entrance to Carquinez Strait and the Napa River, the Mare Island Light was built at the southern end of Mare Island in 1873. The United States Lighthouse Board later realized that a light positioned offshore near the junction of the strait and river would better serve navigation in the area. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1951 and an automated beacon and fog signal were placed on the pier. After years of neglect, which included the smashing of the lens by vandals, the building was saved by investors who moved the residence to the Glen Cove Marina in Vallejo, California. Historical information from Coast Guard web site *The Lighthouse Board relayed to Congress the need for a lighthouse between the San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento River. On January 15, 1910, the Carquinez Strait Light was lit. *The lighthouse stood at the end of a 1.5-mile pier and was attached to a three-story residence. *While in operation this site was used to test the vertical mushroom trumpet fog signals. *The lighthouse was deactivated in 1951.

Retrieved 9 June 2016 Additional information Taken from a December 1966 USCG press release: Carquinez Strait Light Station is an automatic light station located at Vallejo, California between Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay. It was first placed into operation on January 15, 1910. The original structure, a 28-room light house weighing 150 tons, was used until abandoned by the Coast Guard in 1951. New family quarters were constructed on top of the bluff overlooking San Pablo Bay and the entrances to Carquinez Strait and Mare Island Strait. On August 6, 1955, the original structure was taken off its pilings and put aboard a barge. It was then successfully towed two miles to its new location at Elliott Cove and converted into a resort. The new buildings were constructed in 1951 on top of the bluff The main family dwelling consisted of two 3~bedroom and two 2 bedrooms. The men assigned maintained and operated the light at the end of the breakwater and an automatic fog signal. In addition, the unit was responsible for providing emergency repairs on five aids to navigation in the vicinity of the station. A 24-hour lookout was maintained. On June 3, 1963, the Coast Guard personnel were transferred from the station and the light and fog signal were automated.California Historic Light Station Information & Photography United States Coast Guard.

The entire sequence of Rob and Erica's liaison and attack had several different cuts. Rob's severed head was also edited out of frame. The deaths of Erica, Sheriff Duncan, and Marcus were toned down slightly eliminating their bodies' blood flow, but leaving the sound of the Horseman's sword slashing at their throats.

His intention was to create an easy-to-use refrigerator without any moving parts. The technique removed thermal energy, which was driven by a heat source such as propane, electricity, or kerosene. The team rented a room and worked into the night. They slept in the mornings and missed classes at the Royal Institute of Technology where they were students. It took them about a year to create a first prototype that worked with self- circulation. The prototype still had one moving part, a ball valve, and was big and clumsy. Eventually the design was improved and their cooling solution was a world sensation. Albert Einstein once mentioned how astonished he was by their ingenious solution. Manufacturing of the refrigerator commenced in 1923 by the company AB Arctic. In 1925, development was finished, and the company was bought by Electrolux. Other inventions After inventing extruded polystyrene foam plastic, he started his own company in 1955 and developed, among other things, new insulation materials, air conditioners and dehumidification devices. At his death, Munters had over a thousand patents.

Hayes hosts All In with Chris Hayes, a weekday news and opinion television show on MSNBC. Hayes also hosts a weekly MSNBC podcast, Why Is This Happening? Hayes formerly hosted a weekend MSNBC show, Up with Chris Hayes. He is an editor-at-large of The Nation magazine.  Early life  Hayes was born in Norwood, The Bronx, New York City, one of three sons of Roger and Geri Hayes. His mother is of Italian descent and his father is of Irish Catholic ancestry. His father moved to New York from Chicago while studying at a Jesuit seminary, and began community organizing in the Bronx. Roger Hayes spent several years leading community organizing at the Community Service Society of New York and now works as an assistant commissioner for the NYC Department of Health. Hayes's mother was a school teacher and now works for the NYC Department of Education. Hayes was raised Catholic, but stopped attending services in college and is now irreligious. He is a childhood friend and schoolmate of comedian Desus Nice. Hayes attended New York City's prestigious Hunter College High School, where his classmates included Immortal Technique and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the latter of whom he directed in his first musical. After graduating, Hayes attended Brown University, from which he graduated in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy.  Journalism career  Print Beginning in August 2001, for four years Hayes was a contributor to the independent weekly newspaper Chicago Reader, where he covered local and national politics. In late 2003, he began a four-year stint at In These Times, a labor-focused monthly magazine based in Chicago, where he was a senior editor. From 2005 to 2006, Hayes was a Schumann Center Writing Fellow at In These Times. From 2006 through 2007, Hayes was a Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at The Nation Institute, and a contributing writer for The Nation. On November 1, 2007, The Nation named him its Washington, D.C. editor, succeeding David Corn. Hayes wrote extensively on issues central to the liberal community, including what ails the Democratic Party in the post-9/11 era and how the labor movement is changing. He also reported on progressive activists' work to resuscitate the \\"public option\\" during the 2009‚Äì2010 health care fight when many political insiders wrote it off as dead. Hayes was an adjunct professor of English at St. Augustine College in Chicago and a Bernard L. Schwartz fellow at New America Foundation from 2008 to 2010. Cable news Hayes guest-hosted The Rachel Maddow Show in July 2010 while Maddow was traveling in Afghanistan and later often filled in for Maddow when she was absent. Hayes has also hosted other MSNBC shows such as The Ed Show, Countdown With Keith Olbermann, and The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. On November 5, 2010, MSNBC announced that Hayes would be filling in for Keith Olbermann during Olbermann's suspension. However, the network later backtracked after finding out that Hayes had also made political contributions‚Äîthe issue over which Olbermann was being suspended. Hayes credits Maddow with his becoming a host at MSNBC, saying, \\"I absolutely would not be doing this if it weren't for her.\\"  Up with Chris Hayes  On August 1, 2011, MSNBC announced that Hayes would host a two-hour morning show on Saturdays and Sundays, each going into depth on current issues. The first airing of Up with Chris Hayes was September 17, 2011, and featured a live interview with former speaker and current Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. On May 27, 2012, Memorial Day Weekend, Hayes made comments on air regarding the use of the word \\"heroism\\" as applied to American servicemen killed in action, stating, \\"I feel uncomfortable about the word because it seems to me that it is so rhetorically proximate to justifications for more war. And I don't want to obviously desecrate or disrespect the memory of anyone that's fallen, and obviously there are individual circumstances in which there is genuine, tremendous heroism, you know, hail of gunfire, rescuing fellow soldiers, and things like that. But it seems to me that we marshal this word in a way that is problematic. But maybe I'm wrong about that.\\" His remark generated widespread controversy. Hayes initially defended his comment by urging people to listen to what he had actually said. Nonetheless, he apologized on his blog. Furthermore, on his June 2, 2012, show, he devoted a discussion to his comments and the disconnect between civilians and the military.  All In with Chris Hayes  On March 14, 2013, MSNBC announced that Hayes would take over the time slot formerly hosted by Ed Schultz, who would move to the weekends. At 34 years old, he became the youngest host of a prime-time show on any of the country's major cable news channels. According to The New York Times, the change was made in the hopes that MSNBC can win a wider audience than it did with Schultz. Hayes was said to transition better to The Rachel Maddow Show because he is seen as just as policy-oriented as Maddow. \\"Chris has done an amazing job creating a franchise on weekend mornings,\\" said Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC. \\"He's an extraordinary talent and has made a strong connection with our audience.\\" All In with Chris Hayes, Hayes's first prime-time show, premiered Monday, April 1, 2013. The show won an Emmy in 2015 and again in 2018.  Podcasts  In May 2018, Hayes launched a weekly podcast called Why Is This Happening?, featuring interviews with political figures, activists, journalists, writers, and academics. The podcast's first live episode was recorded in November 2018, at Congregation Beth Elohim, in Brooklyn, New York, with author Ta-Nehisi Coates. Hayes' second live episode, held on February 24, 2019, featured an interview with Georgia politician and activist, Stacey Abrams.  Views  Press freedom Hayes criticized the United States government's decision to charge WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange under the Espionage Act of 1917 for his role in the 2010 publication of a trove of Iraq War documents and diplomatic cables leaked by Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Hayes tweeted: \\"The Espionage indictment of Assange for publishing is an extremely dangerous, frontal attack on the free press. Bad, bad, bad.\\"  Books  Hayes's first book, Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy was published by Crown Publishing Group in June 2012. A review in The Atlantic called it \\"provocative\\" and \\"thoughtful,\\" but faulted its policy suggestions as less satisfying. Kirkus Reviews called it \\"forcefully written\\" and \\"provocative.\\" Aaron Swartz described the book as \\"compellingly readable, impossibly erudite, and‚Äîmost stunningly of all‚Äîcorrect.\\" Hayes' second book, A Colony in a Nation, was published by W. W. Norton in March 2017. Book festivals Hayes participated in the 2017 Brooklyn Book Festival (BKBF). In April 2017 he was a featured author at the L.A. Times Festival of Books, which took place at the campus of USC.

Then, after completing commercial training in Hamburg, he took over the management of the chocolate factory B. Sprengel & Co. in Hanover.

History  Formed in 1997, the original line-up consisted of Gavin Baker (guitar), Howard Monk (drums), Hywell Dinsdale (bass and guitar) and Kevin Penney (bass). Their first release was on the Fierce Panda record label, a split-single with Rothko, followed by a release on the Fierce Panda offshoot Livid Meerkat and an EP on Gold Hole Recordings. By 1999 they had signed with Too Pure, who released their debut album 'The Big Dig'. That year they also recorded their first of two Peel Sessions, and toured Europe. Despite good reviews for The Big Dig, they were dropped by Too Pure, only for Southern Records to pick them up, and release the album What Becomes Before in 2001. The band took a break after a second European tour in autumn 2001. In 2003, a third album Dust was released on Tritone Records, with a new line-up of Baker and Monk joined by Duncan Brown (bass) and Anthony Barratt (guitar). A collection of singles and other rarities, Found, was released in 2005 on Oof Records.

History  Early years The development that would become Fiesta Mall was announced on October 8, 1970 by officials from the city and Sears, Roebuck and Company. Sears officials said the company would develop the mall, which would include one of their stores, through its subsidiary Homart Development Company. The mall was projected to cost $35 million to $55 million and encompass 1.2 million to 1.4 million square-feet of retail space on 120 acres. Its projected opening was 1973. By 1973, the opening date for what was at the time called the \\"Sierra Vista Mall\\" was listed as 1975. Development shifted to Mesa after Homart could not secure land in south Tempe. The first component of the mall to open was the Sears, on April 13, 1977. The store replaced the retailer's location in downtown Mesa. Fiesta Mall officially opened October 3, 1979 with Sears, The Broadway and Goldwaters as its first three anchor stores; the fourth anchor, Diamonds, opened July 4, 1980. the mall was developed by Homart, which at the time of the opening of Fiesta Mall was developing several shopping centers nationwide anchored by Sears retail locations. Fiesta Mall and other large developments in the area such as Desert Samaritan Hospital (now known as Banner Desert Medical Center) were facilitated to a great extent by population growth in the southeast Valley and the construction of the Superstition Freeway. In June 1982, Sears, Roebuck and Co. sold a 50 percent stake in the mall to Grosvenor International. The selling price was not disclosed. Under the deal, Homart remained as the mall's management firm. Homart announced plans in 1985 to grow the mall by nearly 40 percent from 921,046 to about 1.3 million square feet. Part of the company's $50 million expansion plans included a fifth department store and an expansion to the Sears; in addition, the existing Diamond's would have been converted into mall space and a new Diamond's store built in a three-story addition. Homart withdrew plans the following year after several delays due to concerns about traffic and parking from the city and other developers with nearby properties. Fiesta's owners renovated the mall in 1989, doing away with the orange and brown color scheme of the 1970s and installing skylights. By the early-1990s, Fiesta Mall was at the zenith of its success. It was the commercial hub of the East Valley and ranked within the top 15 percentile of regional malls in the nation in sales. A survey conducted by The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette in 1992 identified the mall as the preferred shopping center for most Valley residents, and in 1993, as many as a dozen companies were vying to purchase Fiesta. L&B; Real Estate Counsel of Dallas, a commercial real-estate investment firm, bought the mall for $124.3 million in December 1993. Citing continuing robust population growth in the southeast Valley, the owners announced new plans for a major expansion that again included a fifth anchor store. General Growth Properties Inc. acquired Homart and all of its malls in December 1995. Fiesta's management announced in July 2001 that they were searching for a buyer, but said it had nothing to do with increasing competition from newer malls in the area. On April 13, 2004, pop music star Avril Lavigne hosted a free concert at Fiesta Mall, drawing about 3,000 people. The concert was seen as a coup for Fiesta, which was responding to changing times by updating its entrances and adding a children's play area.  Decline and closure  Fiesta Mall started showing early signs of trouble in terms of shrinking customer traffic in the late 1990s. When Arizona Mills opened in the neighboring city of Tempe in 1997, mall officials saw an initial decline in shoppers. Fiesta management said the change was short-lived after initial interest in the new mall peaked. When Chandler Fashion Center opened on October 17, 2001, about eight miles away from Fiesta, the mall suffered its first sustained revenue drop due to a competing mall. The west-facing side of the former Macy's store at Fiesta Mall. Macy's closed in 2014. In March 2004, a study commissioned by the city and conducted by the International Economic Development Council and the International Council of Shopping Centers said the mall faced significant obstacles as a future competitor in the local retail market. The study reported decreasing sales and difficulty attracting \\"top-tier stores\\" due to increasing competition from newer shopping centers and changing demographics. The study also noted recent increases in crime and gang activity in the immediate area surrounding the mall. Despite the mall‚Äôs challenges, the study's authors reported that sales per square foot remained \\"well above the threshold for 'vulnerable malls' of $275 or less, according to the Urban Land Institute.\\" The authors also noted that there were \\"almost no vacant spaces in the mall.\\" Fiesta Mall was acquired by Westcor for $135 million in 2004, a time when the center appeared to be showing significant signs of decline. The period between 2006 and 2008 proved to be pivotal in Fiesta Mall's overall decline. In 2006, the mall lost one of its four anchors following the merger between Macy's and Robinsons-May; the vacated anchor was split into Best Buy and Dick's Sporting Goods. The mall's sales continued to dwindle following the economic recession and the opening of Mesa Riverview and Tempe Marketplace in 2007. During this time, reported crime at and around the mall continued to increase. In 2007, Mesa police reported a jump in gang activity at Fiesta, although mall officials denied there was a rise. Police officials said calls for service increased about 71 percent from 2005 to 2007.Visitors mill inside the mall's wing that Macy's department store once anchored. Vacancy rates hit unprecedented highs in the years following the 2008 recession. On March 31, 2008, a man stabbed two mall patrons, including one fatally. Authorities said the suspect had links to gangs and had a history of mental health issues. Police reported a spike in property crimes including car thefts from 2007 to 2008. In January 2012, police arrested a documented gang member in the beating and attempted robbery of another man near Fiesta Mall. On October 1, 2012, a woman was robbed at gunpoint at the mall. In March 2013, the mall was appraised at $39.5 million ‚Äî a 72 percent decline from its worth in 2004. In September 2013, Westcor turned over Fiesta Mall to its lenders due to ‚Äúimminent default relating to potential tenancy issues.\\" Macy's closed in early 2014, sparking fears over the mall's possible demise. As of October 2016, only 35 businesses were still operating at the mall, which had more than 100 tenant spaces. On January 27, 2018, the mall closed permanently, except for Dillard's Clearance Center. On September 28, 2019, it was announced that Dillard's would close their doors. This left the mall with no remaining tenants.  Attempted redevelopment LNR Properties sold the mall to Dimension Financial & Realty Investments in 2017. Dimension said it planned to spend $30 million to convert the property into a campus focusing on education and healthcare for community colleges and for-profit schools. (Mesa Community College is just west of the mall.) The deal does not include the mall's four anchor properties, which are owned by other companies. In October 2017, Cashen Real Estate Advisors, which markets the property for Dimension, proposed the mall for Amazon's HQ2; it did not make the finalist tier.  Anchors & Majors  Fiesta Mall opened with three anchor department stores ‚Äî Goldwaters, The Broadway and Sears. Diamond's opened later as the mall's fourth anchor. Goldwaters first became J.W. Robinson's in 1989. Four years later, it became Robinsons-May. The Broadway became Macy's. Macy's then moved into the Robinsons-May building after the two companies merged in 2006.

The group is not a tribe in the usual sense, since anyone can become a member. It owns several houses and businesses in the city, and critics sometimes view it as a cult or sect, although members do not share a common well-defined religious or spiritual belief system. The community was founded in 1974 by then 17-year-old Wolfgang Wankmiller, who still leads it. It strives for independence and self-sufficiency with minimal environmental impact, practices ovo-lacto vegetarianism, and encourages free love while tolerating stable relationships. Separate men's and women's discussion groups meet weekly. Children are raised as a group by several women; some children are schooled privately by members of the tribe in a house across the border in Austria (as home schooling is not possible in Germany). Several of the group's activities are related to esotericism, and a self-description states \\"our foremost goal is the perception and understanding of reality and its expression in vibrancy\\". The group also has its own internal currency and employs a creative approach to language, giving uncommon names to days or to everyday objects. It intends to create a genuine new \\"tribe culture\\" and is in active contact with other ecological communities around the world. The group is hierarchically organized, with members having different \\"levels\\" reflecting their commitment to the tribe. There is also an outer circle of people who join the group in some of its activities but for the most part live separately. In the 1970s the tribe tried to undermine several organizations in F√ºssen, and Wankmiller was active in local politics for a while. The Likatier are generally regarded with suspicion or even hostility in the city, and a citizen's action group has been formed that opposes the tribe and supports people who want to leave it. In 2001, a cook of the group was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison for sexual abuse of five minor members of the tribe. While the trial judge found that the behavior was neither condoned by nor connected to the group, critics have pointed out that the cook was readmitted to the community after having served his sentence. The German yellow press occasionally reports on the group in a sensationalist manner, labeling Wankmiller as a \\"Sex-Guru\\", claiming that he believe himself to be a reincarnation of Jesus, and accusing the group of running sex orgies in the presence of minors. To counter negative publicity, the group started a website in 2003. It has always welcomed outside visitors, and has recently started to offer \\"get-to-know\\" seminars.

Medical thermology is sometimes referred to as medical infrared imaging or tele-thermology and utilizes thermographic cameras. According to the American Academy of Thermology, Medical Thermology practitioners are licensed health care practitioners who utilize IR imaging in consistent with medically established paradigms of care. Non-medically licensed alternative practitioners who are not held to the same standard may offer thermography services but that should not be confused with the field of medical thermology. Restated, medical thermology is the use of infrared (IR) imaging to assess skin temperature as an extension of the clinician's physical exam to aid in the formation of a medical diagnosis or treatment plan. Medical Thermology does not condone those who purport that \\"Thermography\\" can find disease by looking for areas of the body that have abnormal heat or irregular blood flow. IR imaging simply does not does not have the ability to assess temperature beyond the surface of the skin. Thermography is a physiologic study and is not a replacement for structural studies such as X-Ray, MRI, or Mammography. As a physiologic study however, medical thermology has many health related indications. The American Academy of Thermology (AAT) (www.aathermology.org) has published internationally peer reviewed guidelines for neuro-musculoskeletal (MSK), breast, veterinary, and oral-systemic disease. CRPS-RSD of the left foot imaged with medical thermology during a cold pressor test. Examples of neuro- musculoskeletal indications for medical thermology include Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD), Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), Dystautonomia, Migraine, Fibromyalgia (and other weather sensitive pain syndromes), thoracic outlet syndrome, and vaso- motor migraine/head aches such as Barre-Lieou syndrome. This is especially true when used to monitor the results of a cold stress (cold presser) test. While there are several clinical studies showing the effectiveness of thermography in detecting temperature abnormalities of breast skin, breast thermography is only approved as an adjunct modality only for breast disease and/or cancer. In that regard it is a breast risk health assessment only. A summary of some of the clinical trials for breast thermography is available in this white paper from UE LifeSciences pdf. Veterinary thermography indications include, but are not limited to, assessment of shoring, limb inflammation, and sweating disorders. When properly used, a commonly known oral-systemic indication for IR imaging is temperature measurement for fever screening. While there are several other oral-systemic indications out lined in the American Academy of Thermology's Oral -Systemic Guidelines. Whole body studies are not performed for medical purposes. Telethermography systems are regulated as a medical device under 21 CFR 884.2980. Medical Thermology versus Thermography Sample image of a hand held thermography camera There is a difference between Medical Thermology as promulgated by medically based organizations such as the American Academy of Thermology (AAT), and thermography as practiced by alternative providers or physicians who overstate the benefits of thermography. As a result of this disparity organizations such as the FDA, ISO, and the AAT have published Guidelines and best use practices to help educate medical providers and the public to recognize the difference between providers who provide medical thermology services and those that offer something else. Infrared (IR) temperature measurement for fever screening correctly done at the medial canthus (tear duct) of the eye. Due to misunderstandings of the technology, the complex physiologic nature that thermographic imaging provides insight into, and large disparities between low end and medical grade thermal imaging cameras there is a lot of misinformation that tarnishes the industry. The Coronavirus pandemic is an excellent example to illustrate the point. Almost anyone can buy an inexpensive infrared measuring device intended for industrial use that has been re-marketed for fever screening, but said devices are not FDA approved for the same, may lack the specificity or sensitivity to be used for that indication, and the end users receive no training in its proper application. In an effort to address this problem the AAT has published both free and paid versions of IR Temperature Measurement Fever Screening training courses. The Level I course is intended for individuals who have financial restraint and have to use non-medical grade cameras. The course provides protocols to help overcome the shortcomings of these devices. Level II training is directed toward businesses and agencies that can afford a medical grade system and have the resources to offer screening that is fully compliant with FDA, ISO, and AAT recommended best use practices. Thermography has been promoted by some alternative medicine practitioners as a means to diagnose cancer, although it is not effective for this purpose. Health Canada has issued \\"cease and desist\\" orders to clinics offering breast thermography as a cancer diagnostic device because thermography cameras are not licensed as a medical device in Canada, and because thermography for cancer detection is viewed as ineffective by medical experts.Clinics ordered to stop 'useless' breast cancer tests, CBC News, Nov 27 2012 The FDA has issued a public warning notice stating that breast thermography is not an alternative to mammographyFDA Safety Communication: Breast Cancer Screening - Thermography is Not an Alternative to Mammography, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration June 2, 2011 and has ordered Joseph Mercola to stop making excessive claims for thermography. Thermography is discouraged in North America by the American Cancer Society, radiologists and the FDA for early breast cancer detection. Advertisements in the United Kingdom have been found to be misleading. The FDA has cleared thermography only as an adjunct method of screening. \\"Thermography devices have been cleared by the FDA for use as an adjunct, or additional, tool for detecting breast cancer.\\" However, they stop short of recommending it, citing the lack of evidence of its effectiveness. The AAT has published several Position Papers, including statements on Breast Thermography that clearly delineate its utility as an adjudicative breast risk health assessment only.

The trade or commerce was referred to as pochtecayotl. Within the empire, the pochteca performed three primary duties: market management, international trade, and acting as market intermediaries domestically.MJ Pisani, J LeMaster, \\"Commerce, International Trade and Management Before the Discovery of Europe:A Modern Management Reappraisalof Aztec Merchant Activity\\", Latin American Business Review They were a small but important class as they not only facilitated commerce, but also communicated vital information across the empire and beyond its borders, and were often employed as spies due to their extensive travel and knowledge of the empire. The pochteca are the subject of Book 9 of the Florentine Codex (1576), compiled by Bernardino de Sahag√∫n.Arthur J. O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, eds. and translators, The Florentine Codex Book 9, Salt Lake City, University of Utah Press. Status in Aztec society Pochteca occupied a high status in Aztec society, below the noble class. They were responsible for providing the materials that the Aztec nobility used to display their wealth, which were often obtained from foreign sources. The pochteca also acted as agents for the nobility, selling the surplus tribute that had been bestowed on the noble and warrior elite and also sourcing rare goods or luxury items. The pochteca traded the excess tribute (food, garments, feathers and slaves) in the marketplace or carried it to other areas to exchange for trade goods.Haemig, P.D., \\"Aztec Emperor Auitzol and the Great-Tailed Grackle,\\" Biotropica, Vol. 10‚Äì11, 1978, pp 11‚Äì17 Due to the success of the pochteca, many of these merchants became as wealthy as the noble class, but were obligated to hide this wealth from the public. Trading expeditions often left their districts late in the evening, and their wealth was only revealed within their private guildhalls. Although politically and economically powerful, the pochteca strove to avoid undue attention. The merchants followed their own laws in their own calpulli, and venerating their god, Yacatecuhtli, \\"The Lord Who Guides\\" and Lord of the VanguardMJ Pisani, J LeMaster, \\"Commerce, International Trade and Management Before the Discovery of Europe:A Modern Management Reappraisalof Aztec Merchant Activity\\", Latin American Business Review an aspect of Quetzalcoatl.

Within each urban area, the pochteca were organized into a hereditary calpultin. These calpulli were highly selective of who they allowed membership, with a potential member requiring both the consensus of the group and the approval of the calpulli's lord.Kenneth G. Hirth, The Aztec Economic World: Merchants and Markets in Ancient Mesoamerica, p. 193-194 In Tenochtitl√°n specifically, there were six separate wards, each ultimately answering to a major temple in the Tzonmolco ward.Kenneth Hirth and Deborah L. Nichols, \\"The Structure of Aztec Commerce: Markets and Merchants\\", The Oxford Handbook of the Aztec, p. 287 These calpulli were notable for maintaining their own temples, as well as their own leadership. Further, pochteca within these calpulli participated in corporate religious ceremonies that bolstered their common identity.Kenneth G. Hirth, The Aztec Economic World: Merchants and Markets in Ancient Mesoamerica, p. 193 This method of organization was to the benefit of the pochteca, as it both increased the social cohesiveness of the pochteca allowing increased safety and profitability during long-distance trade, as well as insulating them from extortion from potentially envious elites.Kenneth Hirth and Deborah L. Nichols, \\"The Structure of Aztec Commerce: Markets and Merchants\\", The Oxford Handbook of the Aztec Markets The Tlatelolco marketplace was the largest of all the Aztec markets. It's depicted above in a clay replica at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The markets of the Valley of Mexico were part of a complex interlocking system, of which there were four levels: * The great market of Tlatelolco which met daily. * The markets of Texcoco and Xochimilco. * The Macuiltianquiztli ‚Äì every five-days markets of the city- states Huitzilopocho, Cuautitl√°n, Azcapotzalco, Mixcoac, Huexotla, C√≥atlichan, Otompan and Chalco. * The markets of the smaller towns and villages. Some of the cities were famous for specialized markets: Texcoco was notable for ceramics and clothing, Tepepulco sold birds (or more importantly their feathers), and Azcapotzalco was a trading hub and controlled all major markets and trade routes. Types Pochteca is used as a general term to describe the traders and merchants of Mesoamerica, but since the word is in Nahuatl, it is more often used to describe the Aztec's merchants. Often researchers use the general term to describe more specific roles like the ones below, so it's important to understand the distinctions. The professional merchants were classified into the following roles: * Tlachiuhqui ‚Äì the producers that manufactured all that they sold, this usually took place domestically so they did not do as much traveling as other merchants. * Tlanamacac ‚Äì the merchandiser. * Tlanecuilo ‚Äì the retailer, usually the one who profits the most from trade. * Oztomecatl ‚Äì the importer. These pochteca were also seldom identified by the products they sold by combining the product they were providing and the Nahuatl suffix of their job. For instance, a tlanamacac that sells chile peppers would be called chilnamacac; a combination of the word chili and the Nahuatl word ending for vender (-namacac). Additionally, individuals were not however, restricted to their singular roles. Some craftsmen seemed to have contributed to small-scale retail trade, often buying and reselling items for profit. Thus blurring the lines between the tlachiuhqui and tlanecuilo.  Hierarchies  Apart from the merchant's designated roles, there were also hierarchies and special pochteca with specific alliances, with military and/or nobility. * Teucnehnenqueh ‚Äì the pochteca trading on behalf of the nobility. They were considered the higher rank of pochteca, carrying out some private trade as well. * Naualoztomeca ‚Äì the 'disguised merchants', seeking after rare goods often on their own behalf but also as spies for the state. The teiaoaloanime were another group of spying pochteca, perhaps a lesser status. * Teyahualonime ‚Äì Senior warrior- merchants. * Acxotecatl ‚Äì the merchant-general. Often the trade performed by these warrior-merchants was a precursor of military conquest. * Pochtecatlatoque ‚Äì the elder of the pochteca, and were no longer travelers, but rather acted as administrators, overseeing young pochteca and administering the marketplace. * Pochtecatlailotlac ‚Äì 'first of the merchants' was the effective governor of Tlatelolco, answering to the Huey Tlatoani (Aztec Emperors) and accounted a magistrate of the Teuctlahtohqueh, the imperial judges. * Tianquizpan tlayacaque ‚Äì the Marketplace Judges, oversaw merchandise and all commercial transactions. They also overlooked the enactment of pochteca laws and sentenced any thieves. * Tlazcaltiltin ‚Äì young boys who were merchant apprentices. They received this title after they've experienced their pochtecatelpopochtin, or their first long distance trade venture.

History It was first lighted on March 23, 1891, replacing the Old Point Loma Lighthouse which is atop the cliffs of Point Loma; the old lighthouse was often obscured by fog. The new light is only above the water. The first lighthouse keeper was Robert Decatur Israel, who had been keeper at the old lighthouse for 18 years. The original light was 600,000 candlepower and could be seen at a distance of approximately 15 nautical miles. There was also a two-tone diaphone fog horn and living quarters for several families. The structure is the only pyramidal skeletal lighthouse remaining on the West Coast. It is very similar to Coney Island Light, Plum Island Range Rear Light, La Pointe Light, and Duluth South Breakwater Inner Light, all of which were built at about the same time. The latter three of these are all on the National Register of Historic Places. The light was automated in 1973. In February 2013, the light that had been in use since 1999 was replaced with a VLB-44. The LED apparatus reduces the maintenance cost of the lighthouse and is brighter than the previous light.

Club career Atalanta A product of the Atalanta youth system, Bianchi made his Serie A debut at the age of 18 during the 2000‚Äì01 Serie A season. He played the final 10 minutes in a 2‚Äì1 loss to Juventus on 17 June 2001. His only appearance during the season. The following season he made an additional 3 appearances for the bergamaschi, while during the 2002‚Äì03 Serie A season he made 16 appearances. Despite being a prolific scorer in the youth ranks, he played 21 games for the first team without scoring any goals. Cagliari He was sold in co-ownership to Serie B team Cagliari in January 2004, where he played 14 matches and scored two goals helping them gain promotion to Serie A. The 2004‚Äì05 season, for which he remained at Cagliari, saw him score 2 goals in 25 matches. Reggina Bianchi was promptly sold to Reggina in 2005, where his first season was hampered by a serious knee injury suffered early on in the season. He recovered to play 9 games late in the season, scoring one goal. The 2006‚Äì07 season saw Bianchi score 18 goals in 37 games. Due to their indictment for sporting fraud, the club had started the season with an 11-point deduction and seemed destined for relegation. They managed to save themselves, however, with Bianchi's performances considered a key part of Reggina's Serie A survival. He finished the season 4th in the league's goal scoring table. Manchester City His form for Reggina attracted the attention of clubs throughout Europe, and in July 2007 Bianchi moved to Manchester City for a reported fee of ¬£8.8 million (‚Ç¨13 million), where he was given the number 10 shirt. Bianchi scored on his debut for City against West Ham, slotting home from close range following a run and pass from Elano. Bianchi's second goal came in a 2‚Äì1 victory in the Football League Cup 2nd round against Bristol City F.C.. Bianchi then scored his third goal in English football in a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Tottenham on 9 December 2007. Then on the following Saturday he scored the first goal against Bolton in a 4‚Äì2 victory. Later that month, Bianchi criticised English cuisine and alcohol culture, and stated how he could never become a full international unless he returned to Serie A.http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/29726/Bianchi- City-have-had-their-chips Loan to Lazio In January 2008, Manchester City manager Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson informed Bianchi that he would be allowed to leave the club. On 23 January 2008 Bianchi finalised a loan move to Lazio after not being able to settle in England. BBC Sport Bianchi set to clinch Lazio move 23 January 2008 In his debut with Lazio on 27 January, Bianchi was sent off after picking up two yellow cards in just under five minutes, as the capital club drew 0‚Äì0 with Torino. He scored his first goal for Lazio against former club Reggina from a penalty kick in a 1‚Äì0 victory. In spite of Bianchi's hope that Lazio would make his move permanent, he had in fact been asked to return to Manchester City. Torino On 23 August 2008, after a summer of much speculation about a possible move, it was officially announced by Manchester City that Bianchi had signed for Italian club Torino on a five- year deal,Rolando Bianchi leaves the club for a fee of ‚Ç¨5 million.Torino F.C.

Life Ravensbr√ºck was the Nazi's largest concentration camp for women. There, 132,000 women and children (and 20,000 men) were imprisoned. In 1945, while Rinkel worked there, thousands of prisoners were killed on the orders of the SS in the gas chambers. She left Germany for the United States and was admitted as an immigrant on or around 21 September 1959 in San Francisco, California. At a German-American club in San Francisco she met Fred William Rinkel, a German Jew whose family had been murdered in the Holocaust,Guard Who Married a Jew Who Lost Parents in Holocaust Among ex-Nazis Who Got Social Security and they married about 1962. He died in 2004. Rinkel stated she never told her husband of her past. Eventually, the Office of Special Investigations uncovered her whereabouts, and approached her on 4 October 2004. Rinkel confessed to having worked in the Ravensbruck concentration camp, as a voluntary dog handler: this activity was better paid than the ordinary work of supervisors. She claimed that she did not use her dog as a weapon against prisoners, and that she did not join the Nazi party. However, other information contradicts this: \\"One prisoner reported that women were even worse than men in commanding their dogs to brutally attack inmates.\\"Women Camp Guards Rinkel claimed to have always behaved correctly. Insa Eschebach, a historian and the director of the Museum of the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, deemed this a protective claim. Dogs could be used recklessly. Some guards let the animals go on prisoners, on whom they, with sometimes fatal consequence, inflicted severe bite wounds. Since other crimes were barred, the Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Ludwigsburg examined only whether it is possible to prove whether Rinkel murdered any inmates. If that could be proved, it risked a life sentence. Also, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem insisted on a trial. On 1 September 2006 Rinkel was deported to Germany under a settlement agreement signed in June 2006 after being charged by a federal law requiring removal of aliens who took part in acts of Nazi-sponsored persecution filed by the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and the United States Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The German authorities were informed by the American authorities after her departure. Kurt Schrimm from the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes stated that her files were given to the prosecutor in Cologne. All criminal proceedings were eventually closed due to missing initial suspicion. She spent some time on a farm in the Rhineland with relatives, then she moved into a nursing home in Willich, Northrhine-Westfalia, where she died in July 2018.Das unglaubliche Leben der Elfriede Rinkel References External links  * Photograph * Category:1922 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Female guards in Nazi concentration camps Category:People deported from the United States Category:People from Leipzig Category:Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp personnel ","title":"Elfriede Rinkel"},{"id":"7094757","text":"1 New York Place was super tall skyscraper that was proposed in 2002 that would rise 1,050 feet (350 meters) tall and would have ninety floors.

Underneath the suggested location of the 1 New York Place another project was proposed.

Before the cancellation of the project the two investors were set to be partnered up with Trevor Davis in the build of 1 New York Place.

It is seen in 16th and 17th century music, for both vocal and instrumental pieces and improvisations. It most likely comes from reciting formulas used to perform Orlando Furioso, an epic poem by Ludovico Ariosto. The name probably stems from the most set canto from this poem, no. 61, which begins \\"Ruggier, qual sempre fui, tal esser voglio\\". Because the melody was so often improvised on, and is inevitably varied in the oral tradition, it is difficult to agree on an exact melody. The harmonic structure, however, has remained relatively unchanged. Harmonically the Ruggiero bass is major, generally in G, and has four short phrases.Gerbino This scheme is frequently used for declaiming other texts which use an ottava rima meter.

Samudrika Shastra is a Sanskrit term that translates roughly as \\"knowledge of body features.\\" Often used in Vedic astrology, as it is related to astrology and palmistry (Hast-samudrika), as well as phrenology (kapal-samudrik) and face reading (physiognomy, mukh-samudrik).Introduction: Physiognomy(samudrik shashtra It is also one of the themes incorporated into the ancient Hindu text, the Garuda Purana. This tradition assumes that every natural or acquired bodily mark encodes its owner's psychology and destiny. Elevation, depression, elongation, diminution, and other marks become relevant. There are five main types of human elements in terms of the Samudrika: Agni, Vayu, Jal, Akash and Prithvi. Traditional stories in India thus abound with descriptions of rare auspicious markings found on the bodies of memorable people. Legends about the Rama and Krishna Avatars, Gautama the Buddha, and Mahavira the Tirthankara conform to this tradition. Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains share this ancient Samudrika Shastra tradition. Fragments of it pop up in other cultures as well. Phrenology and face reading evoke its principles. Sheldon's typology of body forms, ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph (called somatotypes) also mimics the ancient Samudrika Shastra's impulse.

Reboot A pilot for a Dynasty reboot for The CW was announced in September 2016, and Grant Show was cast as Blake in March 2017. The new series premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017. Characterization Executive producer Josh Schwartz said that, according to series creator Esther Shapiro, \\"Blake Carrington was a guy who could run this amazing company, but the one place that he really struggles is running his own family.\\" Showrunner Sallie Patrick described Blake as \\"a white patriarch who is in a changing world\\". She noted, \\"I love Grant Show's warmth when he lies directly to his son's face about having returned the phone. That's just one of the skills that make Blake Carrington the multi-billion dollar magnate that he is.\\" Show said, \\"Blake Carrington is not just your average soap opera character. He's very complex. He's a protagonist, but a very flawed protagonist. I was intrigued by that.\\" Reception Maureen Ryan of Variety called Grant Show \\"personable and charismatic\\" in the role, but noted that \\"a few corporate moves that are meant to make Blake seem deviously brilliant make him look anything but.\\" She added, \\"If you‚Äôre going to base a show around the machinations of a brilliant and ruthless mastermind, his strokes of genius should seem whipsmart and diabolically genius, not predictable or even puzzling.\\" References Category:Crossover characters in television Category:Dynasty (franchise) characters Category:Fictional characters from Colorado Category:Fictional characters from Pennsylvania Category:Fictional rapists Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional business executives Category:Male characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 1981 Category:American male characters in television ","title":"Blake Carrington"},{"id":"7094832","text":"Krystle Carrington (maiden name Grant; formerly Jennings) is a fictional character from the 1980s American TV series Dynasty, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro. Portrayed by Linda Evans, the character was introduced in the series' 1981 pilot episode. In the story, Krystle is the former secretary and new wife of oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe), and initially has to adjust to his machinations and upper class lifestyle. The arrival of Joan Collins as Blake's glamorous ex-wife Alexis Carrington provided a foil for Krystle for the remainder of the series. Evans left Dynasty early in its ninth and final season, though she reprised her role for the 1991 miniseries continuation, Dynasty: The Reunion. In the first season of the 2017 reboot of the series, the role of Krystle was reimagined as Cristal Flores Carrington, portrayed by Nathalie Kelley. It is later elaborated upon that Cristal's birth name is Celia Machado, and she is killed at the end of the season. Ana Brenda Contreras was cast as Cristal Jennings for season two. Cristal let Celia use her identity, and comes to Blake to pay her respects after Celia's death. In July 2019, it was announced that Contreras would not be returning for season three due to personal reasons, and that Daniella Alonso would take over the role of Cristal. Original series Evans originated the role of Krystle in the 1981 series pilot, remaining until the ninth and final season, in which she appeared in only six episodes out of the twenty-two episode season. Evans made her final appearance during the eighth episode of the season, \\"The Wedding\\", which aired on the January 12, 1989, four months before the series was ultimately cancelled. She reprised the role for the 1991 miniseries continuation, Dynasty: The Reunion. Characterization The character of Krystle Carrington is depicted as the dutiful wife to Dynasty anchor, millionaire patriarch Blake Carrington (John Forsythe). Blake's marriage to his former secretary Krystle is the central event of the serial's three-hour pilot episode, \\"Oil\\". Dynasty co-creator Esther Shapiro said of Krystle: Krystle is \\"sweet, loyal, and loving\\", the \\"good girl\\" in contrast to Blake's first wife, the villainous Alexis (Joan Collins). In Women and Soap Opera, Christine Geraghty described Krystle as the moral center of her family, \\"a constant reminder to the [male characters] of the need for integrity, humanity and domestic harmony.\\" Esther Shapiro said that Krystle is family-oriented, and a person who \\"always believed in her heart\\". According to Shapiro, Krystle acts as the show's moral compass, \\"trying to bring decency to the strange and often sinister world of the rich, where the rules are often very different.\\" Evans described the similarities between herself and her character: \\"We both care for people; we both used to seek peace at any price, tried to work out things in the family and felt tremendous joy and happiness in having a relationship. And she (Krystle), like me, learned to stand up for herself at a late time in life ... But I stand up for myself a lot more than Krystle does.\\" Geraghty compared Krystle to her screen rival Alexis, highlighting the differences in characterization: \\"[Krystle] is clearly the counterpart to Alexis in moral stature and attitude. The contrast is presented vividly through appearance and style. When she and Alexis compete [...] the contrast could not be more marked. Alexis is artificial, with white make-up, red nails and lips, black curls, while Krystle is 'natural' with fair hair, blue eyes, free hair [...] Krystle is normally seen at home and she welcomes into it anyone who needs comfort and support. She accepts without resentment Blake's children and she is frequently called on to ameliorate his patriarchal harshness and his castigation of himself.\\" Storylines Season one As Dynasty begins in 1981, Krystle is set to marry oil tycoon Blake Carrington, but receives an icy reception from both Blake's daughter Fallon and the Carrington majordomo, Joseph, although she wins both of them over in time. She soon makes friends with Blake's sensitive son Steven, but her relationship with Blake is threatened by the advances of her married ex-lover Matthew Blaisdel and Blake's own volatile personality. Their marriage is strained by her discomfort as she learns about Blake's ruthless side, especially in business. Blake rapes Krystle when she is reluctant to have sex with him. Later, Blake is arrested and charged with murder. Krystle must testify whether Blake has ever shown a violent temper. In the season finale, a mysterious witness enters the courtroom. Visibly agitated, Blake turns to his lawyer and asks, \\"What's she doing here?\\" Season two The mystery witness is Blake's ex-wife, Alexis. She testifies to Blake's violent temper. He is found guilty, but given a suspended sentence. Krystle also learns that she is pregnant. Krystle loses her baby in a horse riding accident. Blake suggests that Krystle meet with his friend, psychiatrist Nick Toscanni. Krystle suspects that Alexis may have caused her accident. She confronts Alexis, and the women have a vicious fight. Krystle feels alienated from Blake with Alexis around, and Nick tries to seduce her. Blake accuses her of having an affair with Nick, but Krystle has been faithful. Blake goes to confront Nick but does not return. Worried, Krystle goes to find him. Season three Krystle finds Blake and gets him to safety.

She won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in 1984 and 1985. In the book Cultural Theory and Popular Culture, John Storey likened Krystle to the characters Deirdre Barlow from Coronation Street, Pamela Ewing from Dallas and Kathy Beale from EastEnders, as they are associated \\"not merely with moral values but also the capacity to speak out when necessary in defence of the truth.\\" Reboot Ana Brenda Contreras portrayed Cristal in the second season of the 2017 reboot series. Daniella Alonso portrays Cristal in the third season of the 2017 reboot series. Casting A pilot for a Dynasty reboot for The CW was announced in September 2016, and Nathalie Kelley was cast as Cristal Flores, a Hispanic reimagining of Krystle, in January 2017. Kelley said that producers offered her the role after seeing her work in The CW series The Vampire Diaries, and she signed on before reading a script. The first season premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017. In June 2018, Kelley told E! News that she was not asked to return for season two. She said in 2020 that she had been surprised to get the call that she would not be returning to the series, and explained: The CW announced in August 2018 that Ana Brenda Contreras had been cast as \\"the real Cristal Flores\\" for the second season. In July 2019, the network announced that Contreras would not be returning for season three for personal reasons, and that Daniella Alonso would take over the role of Cristal. In May 2020, showrunner Josh Reims confirmed that Alonso would be back for season four, saying \\"I kind of wanted to do this thing‚Äîwhich I still might do‚Äîwhere we pretend at the beginning of the season that we're getting another new Cristal. But I don't want to scare Daniella. She's so great in the role, and I'm so excited that she's coming back.\\" Characterization Noting that Krystle, in the original series, \\"was pure and the moral center of the show\\", executive producer Josh Schwartz said of the reboot version of the character portrayed by Kelley, \\"With this new Cristal, we liked the idea of not letting her be quite as pure and raising some questions about her past and having her stir the pot‚Äîmaking her more formidable. That really let us lean into this rivalry between Fallon and Cristal.\\" Showrunner Sallie Patrick said of Kelley's Cristal, \\"She's scrappy and she's a hustler and she's a fighter and a career woman, but it's not so black and white.\\" Kelley said of the 1980s version of the character, \\"She's not really given much to do besides be beautiful and look after the house.\\" Kelley also suggested to producers that Cristal should be \\"at least in her 30s. I don't think women around the world are going to be happy with this rich billionaire in his 50s dating someone who's under 30, and that threshold makes a big difference.\\" Cristal and her nephew Sam share a mysterious past in Venezuela. Kelley said that Cristal's Venezuelan origins will allow the show to explore the current geopolitics of that country. Patrick said of the Contreras character, Cristal Jennings: Reims promised a \\"seamless transition\\" as Alonso assumed the role. He said that the character would be written \\"a little more real and a little less scary, which is how we were writing Cristal last year.\\" Storylines Season one In the premiere episode \\"I Hardly Recognized You\\", Cristal is engaged to her billionaire boss Blake Carrington, but is immediately disliked by his willful daughter Fallon. Fallon plots to drive a wedge between them by giving her father photos of Cristal with her former lover Matthew Blaisdel, but Fallon's plan backfires, pushing up the wedding and securing Cristal the promotion Fallon wanted for herself. Meanwhile, Anders, the Carrington family butler, makes his dislike for Cristal (and his knowledge of her past) known, and the arrival of her shady nephew Sam‚Äîwho has just slept with Fallon's brother, Steven‚Äîputs her in further jeopardy. Matthew is killed, and his wife Claudia accuses Blake of murder. In \\"Spit It Out\\", a devastated Cristal puts aside sentiment to prove her loyalty to Blake and help him protect her new family. In \\"Guilt is for Insecure People\\", Sam's mother‚ÄîCristal's sister Iris‚Äîis in trouble, but Anders has made it impossible for Cristal to send her money. Cristal remembers her past as Celia Machado, when the sisters stole a fortune, but only Cristal escaped Venezuela. She is tempted by a diamond necklace worth millions, but Sam takes the initiative and secretly arranges the theft of Cristal's engagement ring and other valuables during a charity gala. While Cristal takes Blake on an impromptu honeymoon in \\"Private as a Circus\\", Fallon leaks a sex video of Cristal and Matthew from Matthew's phone. Cristal faces the backlash from her sex video in \\"Company Slut\\". She apologizes to an irate Claudia, who chases Cristal into the street and is accidentally hit by Blake with his car. Cristal insists that a pregnant Claudia stay at the mansion to convalesce in \\"I Exist Only for Me\\". Sam and Claudia bond, but her erratic behavior convinces Blake and Cristal that she should leave. Sam and Cristal learn that Claudia has been taking the wrong medication. In \\"A Taste of Your Own Medicine\\" it is revealed that Claudia has been faking her memory problems. She holds the Carringtons at gunpoint, wanting Cristal to watch her kill Blake, but the rest of the family is able to overpower her. Cristal's pursuers have found her in \\"The Best Things in Life\\", and Anders helps her pay them off. When Blake catches her in a lie, Cristal confesses her secrets to him. In \\"Rotten Things\\", Blake brings Iris to Atlanta for the holidays. Cristal and Anders discover that Iris was behind the extortion plot, and a confrontation with her sister causes Cristal to admit to Sam that she killed his father, Alejandro Raya, to defend Iris. Cristal is a pariah at the mansion in \\"A Well-Dressed Tarantula\\". Sam's father Alejandro reveals himself to her, very much alive, and threatens to expose Blake's father's past crimes if she does not help Alejandro close a deal with Carrington Atlantic. Cristal, Blake, Fallon, and Sam work together to turn the tables on Alejandro and Iris. Alejandro and Iris kidnap Fallon and hold her for ransom in a warehouse in \\"I Answer to No Man\\". Concerned about Blake's plan, Cristal sneaks off to make the drop, but is taken as a hostage as well. Cristal helps Fallon escape, but is whisked away in a truck by Alejandro and Iris. Cristal convinces Iris that Alejandro is bad and will only turn on her, and as Alejandro tries to strangle Cristal, Iris shoots and kills him. The sisters reconcile. Cristal sends Iris off with some cash, and tells the police she shot Alejandro in self-defense, not Iris. In \\"Promises You Can't Keep\\", Cristal learns from a journalist friend, Rick Morales, that Blake regularly bribed Senator Paul Daniels when he was a judge. To avoid the truth coming out, she gives Rick an alternative story about Daniels' many extramarital affairs. Cristal receives flowers from Rick, and admits to Blake that they kissed, in \\"The Gospel According to Blake Carrington\\". Aware that Rick is secretly working with his nemesis Jeff Colby, Blake presses Cristal to get as close to Rick as possible, but she refuses. In \\"Enter Alexis\\", Blake's newly- arrived ex-wife Alexis Carrington tells Fallon that Blake bribed a judge to seize custody and exile her, which Cristal confirms. Cristal puts the Carrington resources behind helping ex-Carrington chauffeur Michael Culhane's ailing father in \\"Don't Con a Con Artist\\". Learning that his illness is tied to an environmental scandal that Carrington Atlantic covered up, Cristal convinces Blake to go public with the truth in \\"Use or Be Used\\", but he later destroys her files on the coverup and uses a recording of her admitting guilt to keep her in line. While Fallon and Cristal work together to gain leverage over Blake in \\"A Line from the Past\\", he publicly announces Fallon's promotion to COO in place of Cristal. Blake wants to mend fences with Cristal in \\"Trashy Little Tramp\\", but she meets secretly with a divorce lawyer. He finds out, but she has only updated their prenuptial agreement to remove her potential settlement, as a means to prove her love. In \\"Dead Scratch\\", a resurrected Matthew helps Claudia escape the sanitarium, and they infiltrate the mansion during the preparations for Steven and Sam's wedding. Cristal catches Alexis kissing Hank and the women fight, which ends with Alexis locking Cristal in the stable house. Claudia snaps and confronts Cristal with a gun. Matthew steps between them as Claudia fires, except that Matthew is a figment of her imagination, and Cristal takes the bullet. The building is set on fire, and Alexis runs upstairs through the flames to release Cristal. Season two In season two, Celia / Cristal has died, and in \\"Twenty-Three Skidoo\\" several women appear claiming to be the person from whom Celia stole her assumed identity. Sam is aware of enough details to know that they are all lying. In Sedona, Arizona, Cristal Jennings watches online coverage of the Carringtons. In \\"Ship of Vipers\\", Cristal arrives at the mansion and shows Blake a photo of her with his deceased wife, Celia Machado. Cristal explains that she was once in a Mexican hospital, where she befriended Celia and encouraged her to emigrate to the United States using Cristal's identity. Blake pursues Cristal romantically in \\"The Butler Did It\\", but she is uncomfortable when she realizes that he sees her as a substitute for Celia, and goes back to Arizona. Cristal returns in \\"Snowflakes in Hell\\" to give Blake her support when he learns that Steven is not his biological son. Alexis tries to get rid of Cristal in \\"Queen of Cups\\", but she only helps Blake and Cristal get closer. Alexis sabotages their plans to leave town together for Thanksgiving in \\"That Witch\\", but this only leads to a proposal of marriage from Blake to Cristal. Cristal's attempts to rid herself of Alexis fail in \\"A Temporary Infestation\\", but Cristal makes sure everyone learns that Alexis is the one who left the baby at the manor. Blake buys a soccer team for Cristal in \\"A Real Instinct for the Jugular\\". In \\"A Champagne Mood\\", Cristal confides in Sam that she is pregnant. Blake discovers the pregnancy test and announces the news publicly. Cristal texts \\"M. Jennings\\" that her baby is Blake's and not his, but she is not actually sure. In \\"The Sight of You\\", Cristal confesses to Fallon that her ex-husband Mark Jennings may be the father of her baby. Fallon urges Cristal to tell Blake the truth, but she is unable to when he expresses how excited he is about being a father again. Alexis blackmails Tony the gardener into helping her get dirt on Cristal in \\"Filthy Games\\", and when Alexis learns that Cristal is unsure about the baby's paternity, she makes sure Blake finds out. Blake is upset, but forgives Cristal for not telling him. In \\"Even Worms Can Procreate\\", Alexis tries to convince Mark that the baby is his, and Blake tells Cristal that whatever the paternity test shows, he will raise the child as his own. Mark shows up at the manor to get the truth from Cristal, and Blake asks him to stay with the Carringtons until the test results come back. Alexis lies to Mark that Cristal is still in love with him, and he and Cristal have a tender moment. Blake sees them together, and offers to have Mark's ban from professional soccer lifted if Mark leaves town. Cristal learns that the baby is Blake's and taunts Alexis. A distraught Alexis plans to commit suicide, but sees Cristal and Mark riding, and fires at Cristal instead. Mark takes the bullet, and Cristal's frightened horse throws her off and drags her. In \\"Parisian Legend Has It...\\", Cristal has survived but has lost her baby, and may not be able to have more children. Blake believes his hired muscle, Mack, is behind the shooting. A distraught Blake kills Mack with Cristal's approval, and Anders disposes of the body. When Blake loses the site of his new stadium in \\"Motherly Overprotectiveness\\", Cristal and Michael outmaneuver Jeff for a replacement location. Cristal's brother Beto has secretly helped her, and now her powerful father expects her to visit. In \\"Miserably Ungrateful Men\\", Cristal resists Beto's demand that she hire one of her father's pet players for the Atlantix, but he refuses to leave Atlanta until she capitulates. Sam catches Beto kissing another man, and convinces him to forgive Cristal for betraying their family. Beto backs down, and gives Cristal a dossier that her father has collected about her and the Carringtons. Cristal promises Beto she will keep Blake from antagonizing their dangerous father Silvio in \\"Life is a Masquerade Party\\", but Blake has the power cut at the Flores-owned stadium in Mexico, costing Silvio millions. Cristal invites Silvio to Carrington Manor and brokers a peace between him and Blake, who go into the gambling business together. In \\"This Illness of Mine\\", Blake and Cristal succeed in getting gambling legalized in Atlanta, but Michael learns that they coerced politicians to secure the vote. Michael's evidence is not enough for the FBI to arrest Blake, so in \\"New Lady in Town\\" Michael alerts Cristal that the FBI is on to Blake's scheme. Blake incriminates himself on tape and is arrested. In \\"Thicker Than Money\\", Cristal objects to Blake's plan to blame her father for his crimes. She goes to the FBI, ostensibly to inform on Blake, but she is secretly executing his plan to exonerate himself and frame Michael. In \\"Deception, Jealousy, and Lies\\", Fallon learns that Blake and Cristal's separation is only a ruse, and realizes that they are framing Michael for Blake's crimes. Before Blake and Cristal are able to marry, two bodies are discovered in the lake. Reception In 2017, Tierney Bricker of E! Online dubbed Nathalie Kelley \\"this season's breakout star\\". Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote, \\"Kelley isn't given much to work with. There's not enough depth or textured drama in any of her scenes; everything about the character seems a bit wan and whiny. Nothing about this Cristal makes her seem like a worthy love interest for Blake or an intimidating adversary for the headstrong and disapproving Fallon, despite the attempts to give her a mysterious backstory.\\" Notes and references See also * Carrington family tree Category:Dynasty (franchise) characters Category:American female characters in television Category:Fictional characters from Ohio Category:Fictional sexual assault victims Category:Fictional secretaries Category:Fictional socialites Category:Television characters introduced in 1981 ","title":"Krystle Carrington"},{"id":"7094834","text":"A metal damp-proof course between the stone foundation and brick wall Damp proofing or a Damp-Proof in construction is a type of moisture control applied to building walls and floors to prevent moisture from passing into the interior spaces. Dampness problems are among the most frequent problems encountered in residences.DPC visible between concrete foundation and brickwork. Damp proofing is defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as a material that resists the passage of water with no hydrostatic pressure. Waterproof is defined by the ASTM as a treatment that resists the passage of water under pressure.Greenlaw, Bruce. \\"Moisture- Proofing New Basements\\", Foundations and concrete work. Newtown, Connecticut: Taunton Press, 2003. 93. Print. Generally, damp proofing keeps moisture out of a building, where vapor barriers keep interior moisture from getting into walls. Moisture resistance is not necessarily absolute; it is usually defined by a specific test method, limits, and engineering tolerances.  Methods  Damp proofing is accomplished several ways including: * A damp-proof course (DPC) is a barrier through the structure designed to prevent moisture rising by capillary action such as through a phenomenon known as rising damp. Rising damp is the effect of water rising from the ground into property. The damp proof course may be horizontal or vertical.Punmia, B. C., A. K. Jain, and Arun Kumar Jain. Building construction. 10th ed. New Delhi: Laxmi Pub., 2008. 631. Print. A DPC layer is usually laid below all masonry walls, regardless if the wall is a load bearing wall or a partition wall. * A damp-proof membrane (DPM) is a membrane material applied to prevent moisture transmission. A common example is polyethylene sheeting laid under a concrete slab to prevent the concrete from gaining moisture through capillary action.\\"Damp-proof membrane (dpm, DPM)\\" def. 1. Gorse, Christopher A., and David Johnston. A dictionary of construction, surveying, and civil engineering. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012. 104. Print. A DPM may be used for the DPC. * Integral damp proofing in concrete involves adding materials to the concrete mix to make the concrete itself impermeable. * Surface suppressant coating with thin water proof materials such as epoxy resin for resistance to non-pressurized moisture such as rain water or a coating of cement sprayed on such as shotcrete which can resist water under pressure. * Cavity wall construction, such as rainscreen construction, is where the interior walls are separated from the exterior walls by a cavity. * Pressure grouting cracks and joints in masonry materials. Materials Materials widely used for damp proofing include: * Flexible materials like butyl rubber, hot bitumen (asphalt), plastic sheets, bituminous felts, sheets of lead, copper, etc. * Semi-rigid materials like mastic asphalt * Rigid materials, like impervious brick, stone, slate, cement mortar, or cement concrete painted with bitumen, etc. * Stones *Mortar with waterproofing compounds * Coarse sand layers under floors * Continuous plastic sheets under floors Masonry construction A DPC is a durable, impermeable material such as slate, felt paper, metal, plastic or special engineered bricksCurtin, William George. Structural masonry designers' manual. 3rd ed. revised Oxford: Blackwell Science, 2008. 314. Print. bedded into the mortar between two courses of bricks or blocks. It can often be seen as a thin line in the mortar near ground level. To create a continuous barrier, pieces of DPC or DPM may be sealed together. In addition, the DPC may be sealed to the DPM around the outside edges of the ground floor, completely sealing the inside of the building from the damp ground around it. In a masonry cavity wall, there is usually a DPC in both the outer and inner wall. In the outer wall it is normally to above ground level (the height of 2-3 brick courses). This allows rain to form puddles and splash up off the ground, without saturating the wall above DPC level. The wall below the DPC may become saturated in rainy weather. The DPC in the inner wall is usually below floor level, (under a suspended timber floor structure), or, with a solid concrete floor, it is usually found immediately above the floor slab so that it can be linked to the DPM under the floor slab. This enables installation of skirting boards above floor level without fear of puncturing it. Alternatively, instead of fitting separate inner and outer DPCs, it is common in commercial housebuilding to use a one- piece length of rigid plastic (with an angled section) that fits neatly across the cavity and slots into both walls (a cavity tray). This method requires weep vents to enable water to drain from the cavity, otherwise dampness could rise from above the DPC. Concrete walls and floors Concrete normally allows moisture to pass through so a vertical vapor barrier is needed. Barriers may be a coating or membrane applied to the exterior of the concrete. The coating may be asphalt, asphalt emulsion, a thinned asphalt called cutback asphalt, or an elastomer.Greenlaw, Bruce. \\"Moisture-Proofing New Basements\\", Foundations and concrete work. Newtown, Connecticut: Taunton Press, 2003. 93-101. Print. Membranes are rubberized asphalt or EPDM rubber. Rubberized products perform better because concrete sometimes develops cracks and the barrier does not crack with the concrete. Remedial damp proofing Until the 20th century, masonry buildings in Europe and North America were generally constructed from highly permeable materials such as stone and lime-based mortars and renders covered with soft water-based paints which all allowed any damp to diffuse into the air without damage. The later application of impermeable materials which prevent the natural dispersion of damp, such as tile, linoleum, cement and gypsum-based materials and synthetic paints is thought by some to be the most significant cause of damp problems in older buildings. There are many solutions for dealing with dampness in existing buildings, the choice of which will largely be determined by the types of dampness that are affecting the building, e.g., rising damp, hygroscopic damp, condensation, penetrating damp, etc. Health and safety Some DPC materials may contain asbestos fibres. This was more commonly found in the older, grey sealants as well as flexible tar boards.

Steven is noteworthy as one of the earliest gay main characters on American television. Despite identifying as homosexual, Steven has relationships with both men and women throughout the series. The role was originated by Al Corley in the show's first episode in 1981; Corley left at the end of the second season in 1982 after complaining about Steven's \\"ever- shifting sexual preferences\\" and wanting \\"to do other things.\\" The character was recast in 1983 with Jack Coleman, the change in appearance attributed to plastic surgery after an oil rig explosion. Coleman remained on the show until 1988, but Corley returned to the role of Steven for the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion when Coleman was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts. In the 2017 reboot of the series, Steven is played by actor James Mackay. Impact and criticism Making television history Steven has been called the first openly gay character on a prime time drama series, and remains one of the most well-known of the earliest gay characters on television. Suzanna Danuta Walters writes that because of the character, \\"in the annals of gay TV history, the '80s will be remembered as the Dynasty years.\\" Initially the only son of series' patriarch Blake Carrington (John Forsythe), \\"handsome, blond hunk\\" Steven was a regular character featured in front-burner storylines for his entire run on the series. In contrast to his ruthless, warring parents and promiscuous sister, the character was poised as \\"the moral conscience of the family.\\" Still, he was defined primarily by his sexuality, his struggle against it and the conflict it created within his family. Potential and execution Corley noted, \\"what attracted me was playing a gay character ... The only gay television character I knew about at the time was Billy Crystal's gay character Jodie Dallas on ABC's Soap, which was a dark comedy.\\" Dynasty co-creator Esther Shapiro noted in a 1981 Esquire magazine article that the character of Steven \\"was, is, and always will be gay\\", but explained that she initially intended for him to be confused about his sexuality for two seasons before ultimately becoming a \\"well-rounded gay character\\". With Dynasty becoming one of the 20 highest-rated American prime time series by the end of its second season and eventually rising to #1 in 1985, Steven \\"had great potential for breaking through the usual stereotypes\\" and his life \\"could have been explored in storylines in which [his] sexuality did not necessarily have to be problematized.\\" However, it has been noted that with \\"interference\\" from network Broadcast Standards and Practices and \\"pressure from the religious right\\", this potential was never fully realized. Walters writes that Steven‚Äî\\"stalwartly manly and deeply troubled by his homosexuality\\"‚Äîled viewers on a \\"Hollywood tour of homosexuality\\" over eight seasons, \\"from tortured closet case, to 'cured' heterosexual husband, and finally to a vague approximation of gay and proud.\\" She adds that the character's \\"persistent attempts to 'go straight' and the adamant avoidance of any gay milieu or culture\\" paint Dynasty as \\"flawed and compromised\\", but acknowledges that the series remains a staple of gay iconography despite its primary gay character being \\"hardly a role model of self-acceptance and pride.\\" Corley left Dynasty at the end of the second season in 1982, after complaining publicly in Interview that \\"Steven doesn't have any fun... He doesn't laugh; he has no humor\\". Corley also lamented Steven's \\"ever-shifting sexual preferences\\", and stated that he wanted \\"to do other things\\". The character was recast in 1983 with Jack Coleman, the change in appearance attributed to plastic surgery after an oil rig explosion. Coleman remained on the show until 1988, but Corley returned to the role of Steven for the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion when Coleman was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts. In a 2006 interview with TV Guide, Coleman reaffirmed that having a gay main character on a prime time drama in the early 1980s \\"was quite daring at that time. I think the only other gay character in a series was Billy Crystal on Soap, and that was a comedy. But [Steven] was so timid by today's standards, especially looking at what's on cable, with The L Word, Queer as Folk and shows like that. Dynasty now seems unbelievably quaint.\\" Commenting on Steven's romantic relationship with Luke Fuller (played by Billy Campbell), Coleman noted, \\"It was very much The Donna Reed Show in terms of four feet on the floor, nobody actually ever touching.\\" Legacy It has also been suggested that the increased visibility of gay characters like Steven on network series in the late 1970s and 1980s (who owed their own existence to relaxing social restrictions and the 1969 Stonewall riots) sparked a backlash from \\"fundamentalists who complained to advertisers\\", and by the spring of 1991 there were no gay characters in evidence at all. This ultimately paved the way for a reversal of the trend and Ellen DeGeneres' watershed coming out in 1997, the subsequent \\"steady stream of ... well-developed, three- dimensional gay and lesbian characters\\" on television, and the relative \\"open door\\" of the 2000s. David Bitler of MTV's LGBT-targeted channel Logo said in 2005 that \\"today's youth generation is more accustomed to seeing gay characters on television, because gay visibility in pop culture has only increased exponentially during the last 10 to 15 years\\" with the depiction of gay and lesbian characters on shows such as Dawson's Creek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Real World and Road Rules becoming commonplace. Comparing Steven's 1981 confrontation with his father over his sexuality to the 2005 coming out of Desperate Housewives teen Andrew Van de Kamp to his mother, Damon Romine of GLAAD noted in a 2005 PlanetOut.com article that though both Blake Carrington and Bree Van de Kamp encourage their sons to \\"change\\"‚Äîwhich is not possible‚Äîin 1981 this was presented as a \\"serious suggestion\\", whereas in 2005 the idea is \\"ridiculous\\". Romine added, \\"That's progress, even though we still have a long way to go.\\" In the same article Jenny Stewart of PlanetOut.com posed the question of whether Steven Carrington \\"was a groundbreaking first who blazed a trail for the must-see gay TV of the new millennium or a last gasp of the traditional 'gayness as tragedy' storyline.\\" Storylines Original series (1981‚Äì1988) Season 1 As Dynasty begins on January 12, 1981, Carrington heir Steven (Al Corley) returns to Denver from New York City to attend the wedding of his father, powerful oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe). Though the details are at first unclear, father and son are somewhat estranged, and their reunion is an awkward one. The Carrington family dynamic is soon established; thoughtful and sensitive Steven resists his father's pressure to step into his role as future leader of Blake's empire, while his spoiled sister Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin), better suited to follow in Blake's footsteps, is underestimated by‚Äîand considered little more than a trophy to‚Äîfather Blake. Steven is devoted to and loved by Fallon, who sees the differences between her brother and Blake but does not understand why they cannot be reconciled. Steven, knowing Fallon's devotion to Blake, is hesitant to open up to her. Steven befriends Krystle (Linda Evans), Blake's former secretary and future wife, who is adjusting to life at the mansion despite chilly receptions from Fallon and the Carrington household staff. At the end of the three-hour premiere episode \\"Oil\\", Steven finally confronts his father, criticizing Blake's capitalistic values and seemingly-amoral business practices. Blake explodes, revealing the secret of which Steven thought his father was unaware: Blake is disgusted by Steven's homosexuality, and his refusal to \\"conform\\" sets father and son at odds for some time. To Blake's chagrin, Steven goes to work for Walter Lankershim (Dale Robertson), a small- time oilman and rival to Blake, and his new business partner Matthew Blaisdel (Bo Hopkins), Steven's old friend and Blake's former employee, who had previously been involved with Krystle. Though Walter brings Steven to a brothel in a fatherly attempt to resolve his sexual confusion, he and Matthew are unfazed by Steven's supposed preference for men, and Matthew even defends him against the homophobic glares of other oil rig workers. Steven finds a kindred spirit in Matthew's fragile wife Claudia (Pamela Bellwood), who is trying to put her life back together after a mental breakdown, and they secretly kiss in \\"The Chauffeur Tells a Secret\\". Steven is framed for an accident at Walter's oil rig and fired. He is offered his job back when his innocence is later proven, but declines; after beginning an affair with Claudia in \\"The Necklace\\", Steven decides to work for Blake at Denver- Carrington. Despite Fallon's machinations to keep him away, Steven's ex-lover Ted Dinard (Mark Withers) appears, hoping to reconcile. Steven spends the night with Ted, soon deciding he must break it off with both Ted and Claudia. As Steven and Ted are saying their final goodbyes in \\"The Separation\\", Blake enters to find them in a chaste embrace. Blake, whose discomfort with Steven's sexuality manifests itself in rage, angrily pushes the two men apart. Ted falls backward and hits his head; the injury proves fatal and Blake is arrested and charged with murder. Angry and upset, Steven testifies that Ted's death had been the result of malicious intent, which infuriates Blake and Fallon. A veiled surprise witness for the prosecution appears in the season finale \\"The Testimony\\", and Fallon gasps in recognition: \\"Oh my God, that's my mother!\\" Season 2 In the second-season premiere \\"Enter Alexis\\" (1981), the former Alexis Carrington (Joan Collins) testifies that ex-husband Blake has a violent temper, which proves damaging to his case. Blake is convicted for Ted's death but does not serve any jail time. Fallon is cold toward Alexis and Blake is openly hostile; at odds with his father, Steven is drawn to the long-absent mother he hardly remembers. He is seduced by the apparent devotion of Alexis, whom Blake had exiled from Denver and her children's lives after he had discovered her affair with another man. Steven soon gets a taste of his mother's poison in \\"Alexis' Secret\\": according to Alexis, Fallon is not Blake's daughter at all, and she later indicates that Fallon's father is in fact Blake's longtime friend and business rival, Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner). The secret eating at him, a drunken Steven falls, hits his head and nearly drowns in the pool. Steven and Blake put aside their differences, and a convalescing Steven meets Krystle's visiting niece Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear) in \\"Reconciliation\\" (1981). When Alexis suggests that, as Blake's only heir, Steven should get married, he considers the idea and approaches Claudia about resuming their relationship. Steven and Sammy Jo begin dating, although he is unable at first to make love to her. Steven proposes to Claudia; still in love with Matthew, she declines, driving Steven back to Sammy Jo. They elope in the 1982 episode \\"Sammy Jo and Steven Marry\\". Blake and Alexis do not approve of the match; the marriage is short-lived, however, as Alexis pays Sammy Jo to leave Steven and Denver in \\"The Baby\\". Fallon is devastated at the revelation that Blake is not her father, but a blood test proves their biological connection in \\"The Gun\\" as Steven follows Sammy Jo to Hollywood. On his way home to Denver in \\"The Shakedown\\", Steven meets an attractive male stranger who subsequently tries to blackmail him; Steven beats him up, and is arrested. In the April 28, 1982 episode \\"The Two Princes\\", Steven confronts the entire family, berating them for their intolerance and elitist values, and stating for all to hear that he is gay and unashamed. Vowing to live his own life on his own terms, he leaves the mansion.\\"The Two Princes\\" (1982) features Al Corley's final appearance as Steven for the run of the series. Season 3 In the eighth episode of the season, \\"La Mirage\\", Fallon finally receives a letter from Steven, who is working on an oil rig in the Java Sea. Jack Coleman debuts as Steven (his face unseen) in the December 1, 1982 episode \\"Acapulco\\" as the oil rig explodes. Blake and Alexis rush to Indonesia to search for him, but Steven is presumed dead; Blake refuses to believe it. In \\"Samantha\\", Sammy Jo reappears with a baby, who, she claims, is her son by Steven. Announcing her desire to seek fame as a model in New York City in the January 5, 1983 episode \\"Danny\\", Sammy Jo hopes that Blake and Krystle will take baby Danny off her hands. Meanwhile, Steven is alive in a Singapore hospital, his face bandaged after extensive cosmetic surgery. Alexis wants custody of Danny herself but is soon distracted by greedy Adam's machinations. Several episodes later in \\"The Mirror\\", Steven's bandages are removed. He considers letting his family continue to believe that he is dead, but Steven's doctor contacts Blake. Blake recognizes his son despite the surgery, but Steven refuses to return to Denver. He reconsiders when Blake tells him about Danny. Steven makes an emotional return to the Carrington mansion in \\"Fathers and Sons\\", reuniting with his loved ones and meeting his long-lost brother Adam and infant son Danny for the first time. Alexis admits that she had paid Sammy Jo to leave Denver and suggests that Blake had bribed her to leave Danny behind; Steven visits Sammy Jo in New York in \\"The Downstairs Bride\\" but returns alone. Steven finds himself in the middle of his parents' fight over a potential merger of their companies initiated by a plotting Alexis. Blake is dismayed when Steven accepts a job offer from Alexis and makes known his plan to move out of the mansion with Danny. In the March 30, 1983 episode \\"The Dinner\\" Steven visits Claudia, who had returned to the sanitarium after another breakdown during his absence. Tensions between Blake and Steven escalate further thanks to Alexis, who manages to keep her Steven away from a dinner planned by Krystle to mend fences between father and son. In the third- season finale \\"The Cabin\\", Blake learns that Steven is living with his attorney, Chris Deegan (Grant Goodeve). Suspecting that the men are more than friends,While Chris admits to Blake that he is gay, the exact nature of his past or current relationship with Steven is never explained. Blake decides to sue Steven for custody of Danny. Season 4 When Steven learns of his father's plans, he and Blake come to blows. Chris represents Steven at the custody trial. Blake argues that a homosexual cannot be a good parent, while Steven argues that Blake, as a convicted murderer, is worse. Alexis testifies that Blake paid off Sammy Jo to leave the baby in Denver; while Sammy Jo testifies that Steven is promiscuous. Claudia, who has recently been released from a sanitarium, tells Steven that she has a plan to win the custody trial. Steven and Claudia fly to Reno and are married. In episode 67, \\"Tender Comrades\\", they are awarded custody of Danny. In episode 72, Steven and Blake reconcile and by episode 74 Steven and Claudia have moved back into the mansion. Steven is concerned about Claudia's fragile emotional state when she starts receiving flowers (violets), gifts and phone calls from her missing (and presumed dead) husband, Matthew. In their investigation, Steven and Claudia travel to South America and visit the site where Matthew and Lindsay crashed. When Steven finds Dex Dexter with violets at ColbyCo, he suspects that Dex is responsible. Eventually they learn that the calls and gifts were from Morgan Hess, a private investigator with ties to Alexis. However, it is Sammy Jo who is paying Hess to harass the couple. She returns to Denver and announces that she will fight for custody of Danny. Season 5 Luke (Billy Campbell), Claudia (Pamela Bellwood), and Steven (Jack Coleman), from \\"Triangles\\" (1985) Sammy Jo kidnaps Danny, and demands $30,000/month for his return. However, Claudia convinces Adam to help get Danny back, and Sammy Jo returns to New York, defeated. Meanwhile, Steven is distressed by his mother's arrest for the murder of Mark Jennings, Krystle's ex-husband. After an anonymous tip to the DA, Steven is called as a witness where he testifies that he saw his mother push Mark off her balcony. Alexis is furious and disowns Steven. Her lover, Dex, discovers that disgraced former Congressman Neal McVane, disguised as Alexis, is the real killer. After her acquittal, Steven and his mother reconcile when she realizes it was a case of mistaken identity and he returns to work at ColbyCo. In episode 91, Steven and his family learn that Fallon has been killed in a plane crash with her lover, Peter DeVilbis. In episode 96, Steven learns that he has another sister, Amanda, born after his parents divorced and raised by Alexis' cousin. Although Alexis denies it at first, eventually she admits that Amanda is Blake's daughter. At work, Steven meets a gay co-worker named Luke Fuller. Although Luke is attracted to Steven, their relationship is platonic at first. Claudia, however, is troubled by the growing friendship between the two men, and eventually has an extramarital affair with Dean Caldwell. When Steven learns of the affair, he sleeps with Luke. In episode 105, \\"Triangles\\", Steven decides to end the affair and reconcile with Claudia. However, by episode 110 Steven tells Claudia that while he loves her, he also loves Luke. Claudia, prompted by Adam, flies to Mexico to divorce Steven in episode 112.Claudia and Adam slept together in episode 107, and will eventually marry Steven's affair with Luke strains his relationship with Blake, especially when Steven invites Luke to be his escort to Amanda's wedding to Prince Michael of Moldavia. Season 6 Steven is heartbroken when Luke is killed in the terrorist attack at Amanda's wedding. After returning to Denver, he grows closer to Sammy Jo who has reconciled with Krystle. Steven is also needed to help Blake, who is having serious health problems. In episode 132, a frightened Sammy Jo confesses to Steven that she's been involved with a plot to kidnap Krystle and replace her with a look-alike. She has learned that her co-conspirators have been poisoning Blake. Steven saves his father from faux-Krystle while Sammy Jo frees Krystle from her captors. After Blake recovers he announces plans to put Steven on his board of directors. As part of his job, Steven must work with state senator Bart Fallmont who does not agree with Denver-Carrington's business plans. While working together, Bart and Steven develop a romantic interest towards each other but decide not to pursue it as Bart has not come out as a homosexual. Adam, with Denver-Carrington's interests in mind, leaks to the press that Bart is a closeted gay man. In the midst of the scandal, Bart is removed from the state senate. Bart accuses Steven of betraying him for Denver-Carrington, but Steven knows the true culprit is Adam. Meanwhile, Sammy Jo and Clay, Bart's brother, are engaged. In episode 146, Steven worries that Sammy Jo may fight for custody again. Season 7 In episode 155, Sammy Jo taunts Steven with threats of a custody battle. In episode 157, Steven is distressed to learn that Danny is demonstrating troubling behavior at school. Sammy Jo continues to threaten Steven, but by episode 163 her quickie marriage to Clay is in trouble and two episodes later it is annulled. Sammy Jo and Steven agree to put aside their differences for Danny's benefit, and in episode 166 agree to live together platonically in an attempt to give Danny a normal home life. In episode 171, however, they give into romantic feelings and make love. Steven, once again, is conflicted over his emotions and sexuality. In episode 172, a frustrated Steven goes recklessly horseback riding, and is injured when he is thrown from his horse. He decides to move out of Sammy Jo's ranch and leaves Danny with his mother. He announces that he will leave Denver after Adam's wedding. Unfortunately, a not-so-dead Matthew Blaisdel and his native South American henchmen crash the wedding and take the family hostage. Season 8 After several days in captivity, Steven manages to overpower Matthew and stabs him to death in the second episode of the season, \\"The Siege - Part 2\\". The incident leaves him emotionally scarred and he is encouraged to seek psychiatric help. Deciding to remain in Denver, he takes over Blake's football team; when Sammy Jo becomes romantically involved with quarterback Josh Harris, Steven is outraged. He orders a medical screening when Josh's playing becomes erratic, and Josh, a cocaine addict, quits the team. Josh proposes to Sammy Jo, and when she refuses he overdoses and dies. Blake, who has been impressed with Steven's handling of the football team, asks him to run Denver-Carrington while Blake campaigns for governor. Steven's management style causes great conflict between him, Adam, Fallon, and Dex; Steven also confronts Jeff, telling him to stay out of Sammy Jo's life. However, Steven bands together with his family when they learn that Alexis' new husband, Sean Rowan, is plotting to destroy the Carringtons. Struggling with the uncertainty in his life, Steven decides that he needs to leave Denver and regroup. In the March 30, 1988 season cliffhanger \\"Colorado Roulette\\", Steven pens a letter to Blake explaining his need for distance and leaves Denver. Adam subsequently burns the letter before Blake finds or reads it. The Reunion (1991) By the time of the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion, StevenOriginal actor Corley reprised the role of Steven, despite the fact that Steven's change in appearance with the casting of Coleman in 1983 had been attributed to plastic surgery after an oil rig explosion. is an environmental lobbyist in Washington, D.C. and is in a long-term relationship with Bart Fallmont, who returned to Denver during the three-year period between the series finale and the miniseries. Steven and Blake finally reconcile when Blake formally accepts Steven and Bart's committed relationship. Reboot A pilot for a Dynasty reboot for The CW was announced in September 2016, and James Mackay was cast as Steven. The new series premiered on October 11, 2017. Characterization Executive producer Josh Schwartz said that in the new series, \\"The relationship between Blake and Steven is not about [Steven's] sexuality. Steven is confidently gay, and Blake accepts him.\\" Their conflict is instead focused on the environmental issues surrounding Blake's energy conglomerate. Executive producer Sallie Patrick said, \\"I wasn't interested in telling a story about a father who is not on board with his son being gay. That's not to say [Blake] was always OK with it‚Äîthere might have been a moment where he struggled with it, maybe that's the back story. We'll see. I also just wanted Steven to be more confident about who he is. For us, it was much more interesting to me that their conflict had more to do with their opposing political viewpoints.\\" According to Patrick, \\"We were interested in the character as a role model of self-acceptance and pride, and whose conflict with his father wasn't about being gay, but more about being liberal‚Äîand how they led to their falling out.\\" Maureen Ryan of Variety noted that \\"like Fallon, [Steven] gets a few chances to express his exasperation with their father's manipulative ways ... Steven is less ambitious than his sister, but like her, he is pulled back into Blake's orbit\\". Vulture Matt Zoller Seitz wrote, \\"[Steven's] conflicted attitude toward his own privilege frequently shades over into self-criticism. He knows all of this luxury has warped his mind, but he can't give it up ... he learns that somebody stole a wad of $100 bills from his pants pocket [and] admits he never noticed the theft. Only a person who has never had to worry about money could be so cavalier about losing it.\\" The series also changed Sammy Jo from a woman to a gay man named Sam \\"Sammy Jo\\" Jones, played by Rafael de la Fuente. Executive producer Stephanie Savage said, \\"With Steven Carrington out and proud, it makes sense for Sammy Jo to be a man.\\" Patrick added, \\"It felt right to make him [Steven's] soulmate.\\" She said, \\"I love how Steven's arc and ability to forgive Sammy Jo contrasts with Blake's inability to forgive Fallon, dramatizing how Steven continues to be quite different from his father\\". Storylines In the premiere episode \\"I Hardly Recognized You\\", Steven returns to Atlanta to find his father Blake Carrington engaged to Cristal, a woman instantly loathed by Steven's sister Fallon. Though close to Fallon, Steven finds himself befriending an earnest Cristal, and warming up to his father. Steven has a one-night stand with Sam Jones, who he later discovers is Cristal's nephew. Steven tries to uncomplicate matters by keeping his distance from Sam, who is staying at the mansion, but is won over by Sam's compulsive honesty and thoughtfulness. Steven is implicated in the death of Matthew Blaidsel, and again clashes with Blake, who he suspects may have been involved. In \\"Private as a Circus\\", Steven works with Sam to retrieve Matthew's phone, which Blake had obtained illegally and was subsequently stolen. Steven channels his father as he coerces Chief Stansfield into clearing him for Matthew's death, but is uncomfortable with the apparent suicide and confession that exonerate him. Soon, Steven is furious when a repentant Sam admits his complicity in the robbery. Reception Maureen Ryan of Variety called Mackay \\"suitably droll and engaging\\", and Matt Zoller Seitz of Vulture deemed Steven \\"the best character so far\\".

Comprising ten notebooks, it is considered by leading historians as \\"an important piece of historical literature.\\" The editors of the German magazine Der Spiegel called it \\"an image of Nazi Germany that has never existed before in such a vivid, concise and challenging form.\\" Kellner began his 861-page diary on September 1, 1939, and wrote his last entry on May 17, 1945. In 1968 he gave the diary to his American grandson, Robert Scott Kellner, to translate into English and to bring it to the attention of the public. The diary has been on exhibit in museums in America and Germany. The first exhibit was at the George Bush Presidential Library in April and May 2005 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, which took place on May 8, 1945. The exhibit led to a collaboration between Robert Scott Kellner and the Holocaust Literature Research Unit at the University of Giessen in Germany to publish the diary in Germany. In 2011 the diary was published in its original language by Wallstein Verlag in G√∂ttingen, Germany, under the title, Vernebelt, verdunkelt sind alle Hirne, Tageb√ºcher 1939-1945. (Literal translation: Clouded, darkened are all of the minds, Diaries 1939-1945.) Translated abridgments followed in Russia and Poland. In 2018 Cambridge University Press published the English translation, My Opposition: The Diary of Friedrich Kellner -- A German against the Third Reich.. Author Friedrich Kellner was a justice inspector in the courthouse in Mainz from 1903 until the end of 1932. During the war years (1914-18), he served as an infantry sergeant in the German army. When the First World War ended and Germany became a republic, Kellner worked as a political activist for the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He openly campaigned against the Nazis until they came to power. Friedrich Kellner 1934 Once in power, Adolf Hitler banned the Social Democratic Party and other political organizations. Concerned for his family's safety, Kellner moved to the town of Laubach in Hesse, where he found employment as administration manager of the courthouse. When Hitler ordered the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Kellner began his diary, risking his life to record the crimes of the Third Reich. He fashioned a hiding place in the back of his dining room cabinet to secure his writings. Despite surveillance by the SS and interrogations, he kept to his self-appointed task throughout the war. At war's end, Friedrich Kellner became deputy mayor of Laubach. After using his diary to help remove former Nazis from positions of power in the region, he returned the notebooks to their hiding place and worked to reestablish the Social Democratic Party. He was elected chairman of the Laubach branch and served Laubach for a number of years as first town councilman. He retired from politics in 1959, at the age of seventy-four. In 1968 he gave the diary to his American grandson. The diary Friedrich Kellner Diary. Volumes of the diary. Kellner considered his diary a response to Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, (My Struggle), so he named his diary Mein Widerstand, meaning My Opposition. It comprises ten notebooks totaling 861 pages. Because of the many notebooks, the diary is sometimes referred to in the plural, as \\"diaries\\", but it is a single work. Altogether there are 676 dated entries. The handwriting is in the S√ºtterlin script, a style of German lettering no longer in use. Included among the pages of the diary are more than 500 newspaper clippings of news articles, headlines, and Supreme Command army bulletins, which enhance the diary's historical significance. Additional material relating to the diary notebooks are Kellner's supplemental essays, news articles from Nazi newspapers, local Nazi Party documents concerning the Gestapo's surveillance of Kellner, and genealogy papers and family histories. Most of the documents, including the diary, were handwritten in the Old German style S√ºtterlin script, so it was necessary to transcribe the documents into modern lettering. The large amount of material dissuaded publishers from the project. Professor Gordon Mork of Purdue University's Department of History, who sought to have the diary for Purdue library's special collections, noted, \\"Because of the length of the material, I doubt that a complete publication of the diaries will ever be practical.\\"Letter dated September 1, 1982, from Prof. Gordon R. Mork to Prof. Joseph Dagnese, Director of Libraries at Purdue University, with copy sent to Robert Scott Kellner. On file in the Friedrich Kellner archives in College Station, Texas Opportunities for publication were enhanced when former president George H. W. Bush, who had been a combat pilot in World War II, arranged for the diary to be exhibited in his presidential library in 2005. Unlike the typical diary, the main focus of My Opposition is not on the Kellners' personal lives, their daily tribulations and how they managed to survive during the war. Yet there are a number of entries to that effect, such as this one written on 13 May 1941: > We are experiencing an almost unbearable shortage in many of our daily > necessities and already there is talk about coming reductions in meat and > bread rations. The farmers, too, will have shortages. Oh, well, the more > victories, the more sorrows. Everything would be much simpler with a little > less lust for expansion and a little more love for peace. The joy of > militarism is a fixed horse for the majority of my countrymen. And this entry on 20 January 1943 about the courthouse constable, who had been assigned by the SS to keep his eye on Kellner's activities: > This Nazi terrorist has a towering rage against non-Party members who manage > to achieve things for themselves. This imbecile has us especially close to > his heart. He makes no secret of his hateful feelings. He does not greet my > wife at all; he ignores me unless he has to come in contact with me on an > official basis. Call to arms On 17 September 1939 Kellner reflected on the foolish choices the Germans had made following World War I, electing Adolf Hitler and the National Socialists to power, and allowing Germany to become a totalitarian state: > We now have gone through the beginnings of two wars. Who dares to forecast > the end of this one? Because of our experience with the war of 1914-18, > Pauline and I are extremely skeptical. A burnt child fears the fire. What > all can yet occur? The undreamed of, the unexpected. The land maps have been > thrown out of joint. Has nothing even once been said of [Oswald Spengler's] > The Decline of the West? Who carries the blame? The people without a brain! > To trample democracy with one‚Äôs feet and give power to a single man over > almost eighty million people is so terrible one can really tremble over the > things that will come. A people allow an idea to be poured and hammered into > them, narrow-mindedly follow every suggestion, let themselves be stepped on, > tormented, conned, exhausted--and must, in addition, under national control, > call out \\"Heil Hitler.\\" One can feel only deep mourning in his heart over > such a dreadful age and over the sheep-like patience of an entire > population. Laubach Courthouse in 1938, where the diary was written Kellner's diary takes to task not only the German people who elected Hitler, but the citizens and leaders of other nations who remained indifferent to evidence that dictators in Germany, Italy and Japan were plotting to take possession of the entire world. In a number of entries, Kellner accused politicians in the democracies of failing to stand up against the dictators. He pointed out that the world's intelligentsia, university professors and professionals in medicine and law, were willing to accept the National Socialist propaganda. \\"Hitler duped the entire world. He had the great unbelievable luck to meet with weak and vacillating opponents, cowardly people who knew nothing of idealism or had a feeling for solidarity, who did not possess honor and love for freedom,\\" he wrote on May 3, 1942. He especially could not understand how those who had defeated Germany in the First World War watched without protest as Germany rearmed itself. In an entry dated 12 November 1940, he wrote: > Chamberlain and the entire subsequent government carry the blame for not > having taken equivalent steps when they discovered Germany's preparations > for war. A world power must always be prepared to successfully and > energetically repulse any attack. Also troubling to Kellner, aside from the Allies' failure to prepare for the war, was their hesitation to enter the war with their full forces once it had begun. When Poland was attacked in 1939, followed by attacks on Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Belgium and France, Kellner looked to the United States to come to Europe's aid. He could not understand why the United States acted so late to enter the war. On 25 June 1941, a few days after Operation Barbarossa and six months before Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, he wrote: A page from the diary > When will this insanity be brought to an end? When will the intoxication of > victory turn into a terrible hangover? Now is a unique chance for England > and America to take the initiative, but not only with empty promises and > insufficient measures. America will not be able to bring about a utopia > here, but if it sincerely has the will to throw its entire might into the > fray, America could tip the balance and bring back peace. At the height of > their insane power, the German people cannot be brought to reason with > words. Only a tremendous force and the commitment of all war material can > bring the wild steer to its senses. I would like to assume that at least > some men in the world are energetically working to do for humanity what all > the other statesmen--through unbelievable short-sightedness--neglected or > failed to do. Mankind, awake! Concentrate all your might against the > destroyers of peace! . . . No deliberations, no resolutions, no rhetoric, no > \\"neutrality.\\" Advance against the enemy of mankind! In the same entry he angrily wrote: > Even today there are idiots in America who talk nonsense about some > compromise with Germany under Adolf Hitler. They are the most atrocious > dummies. Record of atrocities In a number of entries, Kellner records atrocities being committed by the German soldiers. On 29 July 1941 he recorded what he learned of the deliberate execution of captured Russian soldiers in the prisoner-of-war camps: > Wounded soldiers in the field hospital in Giessen are saying Russian > prisoners-of-war are to be killed. Barbarous gangsters! Are the German > people a people of culture? No! A cultured people must be able to think as > individuals and behave properly, but our people have repeatedly allowed > themselves to be controlled and guided by their \\"infallible\\" F√ºhrer without > participating in the slightest degree in their own fate. \\"The F√ºhrer is > always right, the F√ºhrer never errs.\\" And he denounced the German military for their policies against the resistance forces in the occupied lands. On 26 October 1941 he wrote: > In Nantes and Bordeaux in France, two German officers were shot by unknown > culprits. Fifty citizens in each of these towns were apprehended and > executed in retribution. To let people who are completely innocent suffer > for the deed of another is reminiscent of the horrific deeds of wild beasts > in times long gone. It remained to General von St√ºlpnagel to revive one of > the most gruesome deeds. The world will rightfully be outraged over so much > inhumanity, and it will ignite a hatred that can never be extinguished. . . > . How long will this reign of terror continue? Perhaps the single most important entry in the diary is dated October 28, 1941. After the war many Germans would insist they knew nothing at all about the Holocaust.Robert Gellately: Backing Hitler. Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, Oxford University Press, 2001 - Review by Simon Miller More recently, Holocaust deniers have questioned the extent, and even the existence of the Holocaust.What is Holocaust Denial , Yad Vashem website, 2004. Retrieved Dec 18, 2006. The nature of Holocaust denial: What is Holocaust denial? , JPR report #3, 2000. Retrieved Dec 18, 2006. Friedrich Kellner's diary counters such suggestions: > A soldier on leave here said he personally witnessed a terrible atrocity in > the occupied part of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish men and women were > placed in front of a long deep ditch and, upon the order of the SS, were > shot by Ukrainians in the back of their heads, and they fell into the ditch. > Then the ditch was filled in as screams kept coming from it!! These inhuman > atrocities are so terrible that even the Ukrainians who were used for the > manual labor suffered nervous breakdowns. All soldiers who had knowledge of > these bestial actions of those Nazi sub-human beings were of the same > opinion that the German people should already be trembling in their shoes > because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard > enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, in the case of > retribution the innocent will have to suffer along with them. Ninety-nine > percent of the German people, directly or indirectly, carry the guilt for > the present situation. Therefore we can only say this: Those who travel > together, hang together. Kellner also recorded the miscarriages of justice within Germany itself, where the Nazi's disregard for laws and human life took its toll upon the citizenry. On 5 July 1941 he wrote this: Results of totalitarianism Entry of April 14, 1943, about death sentence for listening to an overseas radio broadcast. Kellner was particularly incensed by the internal censorship laws. Censorship in Nazi Germany was implemented by the Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. All media‚Äîliterature, music, newspapers, and radio broadcasts‚Äîwere censored, in an effort to reinforce Nazi power and to suppress opposing viewpoints and information. On 14 April 1943, upon reading that the People's Court of Justice in Vienna had imposed the death sentence on a man accused of listening to a non-censored overseas radio broadcast, Kellner cut the article from the newspaper and wrote next to it: > Ten years in prison for a \\"radio crime\\"! But that was not punishment enough > for the senior Reich prosecutor, who did not rest until he found a court > that would give the death sentence. Just think: the death penalty for > listening to a foreign broadcast! It is inconceivable any other country in > the world would give out such a punishment for listening to a German > broadcast. This terror regime has given itself a gruesome monument into the > distant future. Will there not be retribution, Herr Reich Prosecutor? Two months before the war's end, on 7 March 1945, when the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and entered German territory, Friedrich Kellner tried to explain why the German people themselves had not rebelled against Nazi rule, why it was necessary for outside forces to rid the Germans of the tyrannical government they themselves had voted into power.

She is the ex-wife of Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) whose schemes cause one problem after another for him and their children. The role was originated by Joan Collins in the first episode of the show's second season in 1981, though the character appeared briefly in the first season finale, non-speaking and face unseen. Collins remained on the show until the finale in 1989, and then returned as Alexis for the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion. The character appeared later in the first season of the 2017 Dynasty reboot series, portrayed by Nicollette Sheridan from the sixteenth episode of the first season to the fifteenth episode of the second season. Stand-in Amy Sutherland played a bandaged, non-speaking Alexis in the sixteenth and seventeenth episodes of the second season. Elizabeth Gillies, who stars as Alexis's daughter Fallon, played the role of Alexis after Sheridan's departure for three episodes near the end of the second season. The role was recast with Elaine Hendrix for season three. Alexis' schemes to destroy ex-husband Blake, undermine his marriage to Krystle (Linda Evans), and control her children drive much of the action over the series' run. Passionate yet vengeful, Alexis loves her children fiercely and will do anything to protect them, but she often ignores their own needs and desires in place of what she thinks is best. Alexis marries three additional times, to Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner), Dex Dexter (Michael Nader), and Sean Rowan (James Healey). She is widowed twice, first by Cecil and then by fourth husband Sean, prompting Alexis' cousin Sable to remark that with Alexis \\"death is always a simpler solution than divorce.\\" Her third marriage (to Dex) ends in divorce after Alexis catches him in bed with her adult daughter Amanda (Catherine Oxenberg). The name Alexis uses the most consistently over the course of the series is Alexis Colby, though her marriage to Cecil Colby is her shortest. Alexis is romantically linked to a number of men over the years, including oilman Rashid Ahmed (John Saxon); tennis pro (and Krystle's first husband) Mark Jennings (Geoffrey Scott); King Galen of Moldavia (Joel Fabiani); shipping tycoon Zach Powers (Ricardo Montalb√°n); Congressman Neal McVane (Paul Burke); Blake's brother Ben Carrington (Christopher Cazenove); Dirk Maurier (Jon Cypher) and his nephew Gavin Maurier (Neil Dickson); Cecil's brother Jason Colby (Charlton Heston); and even a near-reconciliation with an amnesiac Blake. TV Guide named Alexis #7 in their 2013 list of \\"The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time\\", and in 2016 Rolling Stone ranked her #27 of their \\"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\\". In 2015, executive producer Lee Daniels noted that Taraji P. Henson's character Cookie Lyon in his TV series Empire was partially based on Alexis. Original series Development and casting In the first season finale episode, \\"The Testimony\\", Blake Carrington is on trial for murder, and a female mystery witness in a large hat and veil appears. Writers Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock, brought in for season two, were told by series creators Richard and Esther Shapiro that the character would be Blake's ex-wife Madeline, who would be played by Sophia Loren for four to six episodes. The Pollocks renamed her Alexis, told executive producer Aaron Spelling that Loren was not right for the part, and warned him that \\"If you get rid of this character in four episodes, you are throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars.\\" Joan Collins said in 2018 that in addition to Loren, producers pursued Elizabeth Taylor and Jessica Walter. According to Collins, \\"They were waiting for Jessica until the very last minute, so they didn't cast me until two weeks before we started shooting.\\" Esther Shapiro later said that the character of Alexis was based on the Roman empress Livia, as characterized in the 1934 novel I, Claudius. Of creating the character, Collins said in 2018, \\"I was basing her on all the businessmen I knew who were heartless, really. The other part of her brain, the glamorous part with the over-the-top clothes, I based on one of my best friends called Cappy Badrutt. She was extremely glamorous, and unfortunately very miserable. But I don‚Äôt think Alexis was miserable. I think she enjoyed her life and lived it to the fullest.\\" She had previously singled out Donald Trump to be one inspiration for the character in a 2013 PBS interview. Shapiro said in 1985 that she and costume designer Nolan Miller \\"had the same vision\\" for Alexis: Joan Crawford. She added, \\"Nolan had designed for Crawford, and he told me that she had a photo index of every outfit she owned. Everything was coordinated: Each dress had its own particular hat, purse, gloves, shoes, and it never varied. Joan Crawford didn't mix and match. We decided to take it one step further: Alexis would never wear the same thing twice. In fact, no one on Dynasty would.\\" Characterization The character of Alexis is a foil for \\"good girl\\" Krystle (Linda Evans), with an opposing moral stature and attitude. Described as \\"scheming, conniving, and ruthless\\", Alexis was often called a \\"superbitch\\" and the \\"quintessential character you love to hate\\" by critics. Vernon Scott of the Sun-Sentinel called the character \\"the scourge of Dynasty\\". In 2018, Collins said that she invented Alexis's backstory as a socialite exiled by Blake after he caught her in affair. She explained, \\"Alexis had the affair because Blake was at his oil rigs all the time. She'd been young and lonely, and now she wanted to beat him at his own game. And she succeeded in many ways. I think that's what made the show so interesting and popular.\\" Collins said in 2017: Appearances Though Maggie Wickman appeared briefly at the end of the first season finale as the veiled surprise witness, the role of Alexis was originated by Joan Collins in the first episode of the show's second season in 1981. Collins was an English actress with a prolific film and television career, best known at that point for appearing in the Bette Davis film The Virgin Queen (1955), and for B movies like Land of the Pharaohs (1955), The Stud (1978), and The Bitch (1979). The addition of Alexis, as well as the Pollocks' change in the writing, were credited with lifting Dynasty in the ratings, and the character \\"quickly set off a host of female imitators in other prime-time soaps.\\" Producer E. Duke Vincent said of Collins in 2005, \\"Joan Collins is the queen of the archetype ‚Ä¶ How do you get that? You get it in the storytelling, obviously, but the actress herself, her personality, brought something to that role which I don't think anybody else could have done.\\" Spelling added, \\"We didn't write Joan Collins. She played Joan Collins ‚Ä¶ We wrote a character, but the character could have been played by 50 people and 49 of them would have failed. She made it work.\\" Collins said in 2012 that Larry Hagman's performance as J.R. Ewing on Dallas had inspired her to play Alexis. Alexis' annual catfights with Linda Evans' Krystle became eagerly anticipated, and Alexis would later have similar brawls with Dominique Deveraux (Diahann Carroll) and Sable Colby (Stephanie Beacham). As the sixth season began, Collins was in a tense contract renegotiation with the show, seeking an increased salary. The first episode of the new season, which followed the \\"Moldavian Massacre\\" cliffhanger, was rewritten without Alexis. Collins reportedly signed a $60,000 per episode contract, and returned for the season's second episode. Dynasty declined in ratings in later seasons. Brought on for season nine, executive producer David Paulsen found that there was no money left in the budget for any shoots outside of the studio, which he felt were important for the show. He hoped to reduce costs for the season by, among other things, cutting Collins from 22 episodes to 11 (she ultimately appeared in 13). At that time, she reportedly earned at least $100,000 per episode. Paulsen also brought in Beacham as her The Colbys character Sable to play opposite Collins. The ninth season finale ended with several characters in peril, including Alexis and Dex plunging from a balcony, which Paulsen said \\"meant that the following year we could get rid of anybody we wished.\\" Paulsen said, \\"I think Joan Collins was angry because she kind of saw what I was doing.\\" Collins was subsequently quoted at the Cannes Film Festival saying that she would not return the next season. However, in May 1989, new ABC entertainment president Robert A. Iger cancelled Dynasty, leaving the cliffhanger last episode of season nine as the series finale. The majority of the cast, including Collins, reunited for the two-part, four-hour miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion in 1991. Storylines Season 1 In Dynasty first season finale episode, \\"The Testimony\\", Blake Carrington is on trial for killing his son Steven's male lover, Ted Dinard. A veiled surprise witness for the prosecution appears, and Blake angrily asks his lawyer: \\"What's she doing here?\\" Blake's daughter Fallon gasps in recognition, \\"Oh my God, that's my mother.\\" Season 2 As the second season opens with the episode \\"Enter Alexis\\", the character has not only a face but a name: Alexis Morell Carrington. She had been exiled from Denver by Blake after an affair with Carrington estate manager Roger Grimes; her testimony, that Blake has a violent temper, proves damaging to his case. At odds with his father, Steven is drawn to the mother he hardly remembers; Fallon, however, is devoted to Blake and has long held a grudge against Alexis, a grudge further fueled by her testimony. Fallon says to her mother: Alexis soon sparks the ire of Blake's wife Krystle, and brazenly moves into a cottage on the Carrington estate: her former art studio which she still owns, thanks to a technicality. The household staff remembers the first Mrs. Carrington all too well‚Äîespecially longtime Carrington majordomo Joseph Anders. Staunchly loyal to Blake, Joseph has a particular dislike for Alexis and has followed her scandalous adventures for years through the tabloids. Fallon, although not openly hostile, keeps an icy distance from Alexis and the two trade subtle barbs; Steven is seduced by his mother's apparent devotion to him, but soon gets a taste of her poison. According to Alexis, Fallon is not Blake's daughter at all: her father is really Blake's longtime friend and business rival, Cecil Colby. The secret eats at Steven, and Fallon eventually finds out. Ultimately, it is proven untrue. Alexis' consistent meddling and intrusions help improve Krystle's relationship with Fallon, Joseph, and the rest of the household staff, and they soon accept her unconditionally as Blake's wife. Alexis makes an enemy in Krystle when she purposefully fires a shotgun to make Krystle's horse throw her; the pregnant Krystle miscarries and is told she will probably be unable to have more. Alexis becomes romantically involved with Cecil, now Blake's adversary, but Cecil has a heart attack while in bed with her. Season 3 In 1982, Alexis and Cecil marry on his deathbed (episode 40), Cecil exacting a promise from Alexis that she will use his company ColbyCo to ruin Blake. Two episodes previously, after their infant grandson L.B. Colby (son of Fallon and Jeff Colby) is kidnapped, former spouses Blake and Alexis make a televised plea that he be returned. Alexis confesses a dark secret from their past: their firstborn son, Adam, had been kidnapped as a baby and had never been returned. Traumatized by the event, they had hidden his existence from their subsequent children, Fallon and Steven. Meanwhile, in Billings, Montana, an old woman named Kate Torrance tearfully tells her grandson Michael that he is really the Carrington heir. Armed with items from Adam Carrington's baby carriage, lawyer \\"Michael\\" comes to Denver and is eventually accepted as a Carrington; but like Alexis, his selfishness, greed and ambition put him at odds with all of his relatives at one time or another. In episode 42, Alexis offers Adam a job at ColbyCo. When she also recruits Fallon's husband Jeff, Adam is jealous. Revealing his devious nature, Adam has Jeff's office painted with toxic paint. Gradually, Jeff's behavior becomes increasingly erratic. In episode 51, Alexis sends Jeff away on a vacation. Realizing that Jeff will \\"recover\\" when he's not breathing toxic fumes every day, Adam confesses to Alexis, who orders Adam to have the paint removed from Jeff's office. Adam warns his mother that if she betrays him, he will implicate her in the scheme, since Alexis used Jeff's poor health to trick him into signing over his son's shares in Denver-Carrington to her. Season 4 In episode 66, Alexis learns that Fallon is investigating Jeff's mysterious illness and warns Adam that if Fallon learns the truth that he's on his own. In return, Adam tricks Alexis into signing documents that make it look like she ordered the office to be painted. Alexis travels to Montana to investigate her son's background and learns from Dr. Edwards that Adam had experimented with drugs as a teen and suffered a psychotic breakdown. She becomes more sympathetic to Adam at this point, feeling guilty that they gave up the search for their lost son so many years ago, condemning him to such a tragic life. As she doesn't want his past drug addiction to be widely known, Alexis is resigned to suffer the consequences of his actions. Therefore, she gave up her control of Denver-Carrington. Later, in 1983, she becomes romantically involved with Farnsworth \\"Dex\\" Dexter, the son of a Denver-Carrington board member Sam Dexter, an old friend of Blake Carrington's. Dex has been sent by his father to understand why ColbyCo. abruptly abandoned its plans to acquire Denver-Carrington. In episode 69, Dex confronts Blake and his ex-wife Alexis Colby. Dex and Alexis are immediately drawn to each other. Dex gets the best of Alexis in a business deal (he discovers information in her office and acts on it before she can) and offers her a 60-40 split so they can work together. Although Alexis resists, by episode 72 they become lovers. Their relationship is tempestuous and passionate. In episodes 82 and 83, Dex learns that Alexis has slept with Rashid Ahmed in order to sabotage a deal he has with Blake. A furious Dex confronts Alexis. She slaps him - and much to her shock, he slaps her back. Their fight soon turns to lovemaking. However, Alexis continues to demand independence from Dex and he turns to Denver-Carrington PR Director Tracy Kendall for solace in a one-night stand. Tracy tells Alexis about their affair, and Alexis ends their relationship. Season 5 After Alexis was arrested for the murder of Mark Jennings in episode 88, Dex rallies to her defense and bails her out of jail. Once she is found guilty because Steven testified against her, Dex and Adam desperately try to clear her name. They eventually uncover evidence that Neal McVane is the killer, trying to frame Alexis for ruining him. Alexis is freed. Soon after, in 1984, a young woman named Amanda Bedford appears on Alexis' doorstep; she is Alexis' daughter, and as news of her spreads, Blake takes a special interest. He soon learns that Alexis was pregnant when he banished her decades before. Though Alexis insists that Amanda's father is a ski instructor with whom she was involved, it is eventually revealed that she is indeed Blake's daughter. Unaware of the brief affair Amanda had with Dex when they found themselves snowed in together in a remote cabin, Alexis proposes Dex to marry her and, as he regrets his actions, he accepts the proposal. Later, Alexis becomes suspicious and tries to keeps Amanda out from Dex by marrying her to Prince Michael of Moldavia, son of King Galen that she had known years ago. But during the wedding celebration which takes place in the 15 May 1985 season finale \\"Royal Wedding\\", terrorists interrupt the ceremony in an attempt to kill Galen and spray the chapel with gunfire, leaving the entire wedding party seemingly dead or dying on the floor. Season 6 Alexis survives the wedding massacre, as do most of the wedding guests, but she is kept as prisoner as the rebels want to sign a deal with ColbyCo. Eventually she is released when Blake pays ransom for her (and for Krystle who was also imprisoned). The King is missing and presumed dead, however, Alexis learns that he is being held for ransom. Dex agrees to help her rescue the King. They sneak into Moldavia where they are captured. In episode 125, Dex escapes and rescues Alexis and Galen. Upon returning to Denver, Dex refuses to let a paralyzed Galen recuperate in their home. Dex suspects (correctly) that Galen is feigning his paralysis and tries to force him to walk. When Alexis rushes to his defense, Dex is driven closer to Amanda. When Dex catches Alexis imagining herself as Queen of Moldavia (complete with crown) in episode 135, he is heartbroken. Amanda finds a drunken Dex and they make love again - only to be caught in the act by Alexis in episode 136. Alexis immediately flies to St Thomas for a quick divorce. In the meantime, Alexis' younger sister Cassandra Morell is released from a Caracas, Venezuela prison, having been incarcerated years before after an incident involving Alexis and her then-paramour, Zach Powers. Calling herself Caress, the younger Morell comes to Denver and hopes to make a fortune by writing a scathing tell-all book about Alexis and exposing her sister's darkest secrets. Alexis finds out about the book, secretly buys the publishing company and scuttles the project. In 1986, Alexis turns on Blake as she wants him again in her life (episode 137). When he refuses to have an affair with her, she decides to destroy him for good. She flies to Australia and encourages Blake's brother Ben to come back in Denver and claim his share of his late father's estate. Alexis commits perjury on the stand and helps Ben to win over Blake during the trial (episodes 141 & 142). Wanting revenge, Blake mortgages his house and holdings on the hope that he will gain control over ColbyCo. Thanks to Ben and Alexis, he loses both the house and the holdings and also his lucrative South China Sea oil leases. In the cliffhanger season finale, Alexis informs Blake she has bought his house. Furious, he grabs her by the throat and starts to strangle her. Season 7 Alexis is saved when Krystle pulls Blake off of her. Weeks after, Blake finds a way to force Alexis and Ben to relinquish their ownership of Denver-Carrington and all its holdings back to him. Later on, Blake, Alexis, and Ben are in southeast Asia visiting an oil rig when it catches on fire. Ben rescues a trapped Blake moments before the rig explodes. Blake awakens in the hospital with no memories of the last 25 years. Alexis has him discharged from the hospital and convinces him that they're still married. However, when Krystle finds them, Blake's memories return. Season 8 A handsome stranger saves Alexis from drowning in a river in 1987; dashing Sean Rowan soon sweeps her off her feet and they marry. Sean soon insinuates himself into her business, alienating Alexis' son Adam. It is revealed that Sean is actually the son of former Carrington majordomo Joseph Anders, and is bent on avenging his father (who committed suicide) and sister, Kirby (who had been ill-treated by Alexis). Sean has an affair with Leslie Carrington and schemes to destroy the family, but is ultimately killed by Dex after trying to kill Alexis. Season 9 A body is found at the bottom of a lake on the Carrington property in 1988. The dead body turns out to be Roger Grimes, the man with whom Alexis was sleeping when she and Blake divorced. He had been dead for 20 years but the cold temperatures in the lake preserved his body. Ultimately, it is revealed that 8-year-old Fallon had shot Grimes after finding him beating Alexis, and Blake's late father had hidden the body in a mine under the lake to protect Fallon. The situation is complicated by the fact that the mine is full of stolen Nazi treasure, hidden there by Blake's late father. Roger's body had been disturbed from its hiding place by a man looking for the treasure. The man happens to have been hired by Alexis' cousin, Sable Colby who was looking for some embarrassing information on her ex-husband Jason. But Sable has not come to Denver for having a revenge on Jason only but also on Alexis, who has betrayed her at several times in the past. Most of the season's action revolves around the battle between Alexis and Sable. In episode 220, the final episode of the series, at the Carlton Hotel Dex confronts Sable and Alexis for using him and throwing him aside. He mentions that Sable is pregnant, much to her chagrin. Alexis and Adam taunt Dex with the news, causing Dex to push Adam to the floor in frustration. When Dex turns his back, Adam rushes him. Dex falls backward into Alexis, sending them both crashing through a railing and falling off a second-story balcony while Adam, Sable, and Monica (Sable's daughter) watch in horror. The Reunion Two years after her fall at the Carlton, in 1991, Alexis (who managed to turn in mid-air and land on top of Dex, who \\"didn't fare that well\\") meets Jeremy Van Dorn, head of Trans-Media Relations, who convinces her she needs to diversify her business. However, Jeremy is actually working for an international consortium who has its eye on ColbyCo. When Alexis learns the truth and wants to put an end to their partnership, Jeremy tries to kill her but she gets saved at the last minute by Adam. Impact The additions of Collins as Alexis and the \\"formidable writing team\\" of Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock are generally credited with Dynasty rise in the Nielsen ratings in its second season, the start of the series' rise to #1. Collins's performance \\"set off a host of female imitators in other prime time soaps.\\" Esther Shapiro said in the season one DVD commentary, \\"When Alexis came into it, it changed the tenor ... And that's the way they are now on television: you have your traditional villain, and I think that plays to a different denominator.\\" In 2002, TV Guide ranked Alexis number 40 on its list of the 50 Greatest Television Characters of All Time. The magazine named her #7 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time, and in 2016 Rolling Stone ranked her #27 of their 40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time. In 2015, executive producer Lee Daniels noted that Taraji P. Henson's character Cookie Lyon in his TV series Empire was partially based on Alexis. Praising Cookie and Henson, several journalists have compared Cookie to Alexis. Awards and nominations Collins was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Drama Series every year from 1981 to 1986, winning in 1983. She was nominated for an Emmy Award for Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1984. In 1985, Collins shared a People's Choice Award for Favorite Female TV Performer with her co-star, Linda Evans. She won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Villainess in 1984, and again in 1985. Reboot Development and casting Elizabeth Gillies, who stars in Dynasty as Fallon, played Alexis for three episodes after Sheridan's departure in season two. Elaine Hendrix portrays Alexis in season three. A Dynasty reboot premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017. Executive producer Sallie Patrick said in August 2017 that Alexis would be introduced during the first season, but that the role had yet to be cast. She later said, \\"We knew Alexis was coming before we even started shooting the pilot, which allowed us to pave the way for her ... throughout the season, we hear Blake, Steven, and Fallon's memories about the woman who abandoned their family. So by the time she actually enters the series, we've established expectations about her character‚Äîwhich Alexis will happily break.\\" The character has a cameo in the pilot episode, seen briefly in a flashback sequence. Patrick said in September 2017: Nicollette Sheridan The role was cast with Nicollette Sheridan in November 2017. Sheridan, known for portraying Paige Matheson on Knots Landing and Edie Britt on Desperate Housewives, had been absent from series television since her character was killed off Desperate Housewives in 2009. Though a longtime friend of Joan Collins, Sheridan had never seen the 1980s version of Dynasty. The CW president Mark Pedowitz, who had been president of ABC Studios during Sheridan's run on Desperate Housewives, called her about the role himself. He said, \\"I was big fan of Nicollette from way back when. She wanted it, and she will be great in it.\\" Sheridan said of the Dynasty role, \\"I thought [Dynasty] was such a splashy, fun, strong comeback. It was just the right thing at the right time.\\" Sheridan admitted, \\"I have always been attracted to playing the naughty girl. And for some reason, my audience loves seeing me in that role. It's challenging to make that person likable, and I get to do it again [with Alexis].\\" Sheridan's casting was a key factor in the decision to give Dynasty a back nine order of episodes after the initial 13. Pedowitz said in January 2018, \\"I'm disappointed in the ratings, I wanted it to do more, but I'm happy with the production values that Josh, Steph and Sallie are doing. There are changes coming, I'm thrilled to have Nicollette [Sheridan] ... I'm looking forward to Nicollette and Liz [Gillies] really going at it as a mother- daughter situation, and I think that will add some juice to the show.\\" A press release announced that the character \\"will return unexpectedly ... challenging Blake's marriage to Cristal, seeking to reunite with her children, and fighting to claim what is hers.\\" Alexis first appeared in the season one episode \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\" on March 23, 2018. Patrick said: Pedowitz later said, \\"Nicollette has been a great addition. She is a disrupting force, she is that diva.\\" The CW announced on February 25, 2019 that Sheridan would be leaving Dynasty to focus on \\"some personal family responsibilities.\\" Sheridan said in her own statement that she was leaving to spend more time with her terminally ill mother in Los Angeles. She last appeared in the season two episode \\"Motherly Overprotectiveness\\". Elizabeth Gillies Elizabeth Gillies, who was already playing Fallon on the show, took over the role after Sheridan's departure for three episodes near the end of the second season. In the story, Alexis's vengeful son Adam (Sam Underwood) pushes her face into a fire, and then arranges for her plastic surgeon to make her look like Fallon. Gillies's portrayal, facilitated by prosthetics, was a temporary recast to give producers time to find a suitable replacement for Sheridan. Patrick explained that the news of Sheridan's departure was sudden, but producers did not want to rush replacing her and \\"compromise the integrity of the casting process\\". She said, \\"We have an amazing cast and wanted to add someone of their caliber to that role. We wanted to take our time with that.\\" Patrick added, \\"In the spirit of the OG Dynasty, we just went for the biggest twist possible as an homage to the double castings and doppelg√§ngers they had on the original series.\\" Gillies said: Gillies said of Sheridan, \\"She has a very specific cadence in her speech, a way of talking that took a minute for me to make sure it was right...I hope she likes it. I really tried to do my absolute best.\\" Gillies noted, \\"Grant Show couldn't even look at me...he was being incredibly squirmy and uncomfortable. It was probably my favorite of all the scenes I shot [as Alexis]. He's so funny and earnest in his performance, because he really is so uncomfortable.\\" Gillies explained that a lifecast was made of her to create the prosthetics, which took five hours to get into and about 45 minutes to get out of. Though Gillies said that she enjoyed the double role and would do it again if asked, she and Patrick agreed that \\"production-wise, it's challenging.\\" Reed Gaudens of Hidden Remote said, \\"Elizabeth Gillies's spot-on Nicollette Sheridan impression is Emmy-worthy.\\" Andy Swift of TVLine called Gillies's portrayal of Alexis \\"the performance of a lifetime.\\" Elaine Hendrix In October 2019, new Dynasty showrunner Josh Reims said, \\"Obviously she's Alexis and this is Dynasty, so I would imagine she may show up at one point.\\" Days later, it was announced that the role of Alexis had been recast with Elaine Hendrix, who would appear as a series regular. The CW noted that \\"Alexis is back in Atlanta, with a new look, a new man, and plenty of scores to settle\\". Of Hendrix's performance, costar Adam Huber stated, \\"She brings a new energy to [the role], she's excited to bring this character to life and to make it her own and not go off what Nicollette [Sheridan] did or what the actors did on the original.\\" Hendrix debuted as Alexis in the December 2019 episode \\"The Sensational Blake Carrington Trial\\". She said, \\"[The producers] encouraged me to make it my own, and I have been\\", describing her performance as \\"a throwback to the OG Dynasty, while also honoring the tone of what's happening now.\\" She added, \\"I'm just ready to be ruthless ... I'm ready to burn it all down.\\" Characterization Sheridan called Alexis \\"a force to be reckoned with\\", explaining that \\"She‚Äôs a complicated person who is driven by power, money, and the dichotomy of an overwhelming desire to protect her children to have them flourish. She is back to reclaim both of her children and help them onto a different path.\\" She said that the character \\"truly is a loving mother\\", though \\"sometimes she gets a little lost in her quest for power or manipulation.\\" Of Fallon she noted, \\"Fallon Carrington is fierce, and upon mama's return, she has met her match tenfold. Alexis has the experience and the wisdom that comes with age. So as brilliant as her daughter is, she's in trouble now. [The writers] are really exploring the mother-daughter relationship, which to me is the most complicated relationship on the planet, so I love that.\\" Patrick said, \\"It's been a blast writing for Alexis, who in our version is part Mildred Pierce (willing to do anything to help her daughter), part Blue Jasmine (delusional on the verge of a nervous breakdown), and Nicollette is perfect for the role. When she goes toe-to-toe with Fallon, it's electric.\\" Sheridan said of her character's relationship with her ex- husband, \\"[Alexis] and Blake were truly soulmates at one point in time, but their relationship was fraught. They have a very tempestuous dynamic which speaks to the passion that's still there.\\" Hendrix said of Alexis, \\"I'm really thinking about what drives Alexis. She's a survivor, and she loves her kids. With those two elements alone, she'll do anything to anyone anywhere at any time.\\" Explaining Alexis's sudden marriage to Jeff Colby (Sam Adegoke), she said \\"They're putting it out there to the world that they love each other, but of course nobody believes them. Personally, I think she really does care about Jeff.‚Äù Noting that in the 1980s series Alexis (Joan Collins) marries wealthy Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner) but he dies, Hendrix said, \\"I love Sam Adegoke, so I'm really hoping the same thing doesn't happen to Jeff.\\" Jeff asks Alexis for a divorce in the season three finale \\"My Hangover's Arrived\\", but she admits that she has feelings for him and thinks he has some for her. Reims explained Alexis's reveal: \\"It is genuine. She didn't go into that marriage expecting to like Jeff. It was purely a business arrangement, but she does like‚Äîas she said‚Äîbeing Mrs. Colby. She did develop feelings for him, and when she walks in on Jeff with Mia, it does hit her harder than she expected.\\" Storylines Season one In \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\", Blake is eulogizing his father Thomas Carrington when a woman appears whom Fallon recognizes as her mother, Alexis. In \\"Enter Alexis\\", the Carringtons are shocked to discover that Thomas has left the mansion and the grounds to Alexis. Blake vows to overturn the codicil to Thomas' will as Fallon makes overtures to connect with her mother. Accused of abandoning her children, Alexis tells Fallon that Blake bribed a judge to seize custody and exile her, which Cristal confirms. Fallon soon discovers, however, that Alexis has not been living a life of luxury abroad, but is housed in a trailer nearby, and has stayed in touch with Steven. A furious Fallon confronts Alexis, and their catfight takes them into the pool. Through a bribe, Fallon ensures that the codicil is invalidated, but Alexis reveals that she does legally own Michael's stable house‚Äîher former art studio‚Äîand moves in. Her renewed influence over the household staff sets off Blake, who issues an ultimatum to them. Believing Steven's new fianc√© Sam Jones to be a poor match for her son, Alexis tries to frame Sam for shoplifting in \\"Don't Con a Con Artist\\". Fallon thwarts the plan, and Sam assists her in a plot to expose Alexis' machinations to Steven. Fallon manipulates Alexis into confessing, but Steven is more mad at Fallon for endangering Sam. A tearful Alexis admits to Steven that she spent all of her money trying to find her and Blake's kidnapped first child, Adam. Distrusting of Fallon's faux husband Liam Ridley, Alexis tries to get between him and Fallon in \\"Use or Be Used\\". Alexis reveals to Fallon that Liam is really a journalist named Jack Lowden writing a tell-all, and Fallon cuts him loose. Alexis leaks information about Carrington Atlantic's possible involvement in an environmental scandal to the press in \\"A Line from the Past\\". As Alexis and Jeff discuss Blake's longstanding grudge against the Colbys, she tells him that he is actually a Carrington. In \\"Trashy Little Tramp\\", Steven finds his long-lost older brother Adam, now known as Hank Sullivan. In actuality, Hank is Alexis's lover and a key part of her master plan to steal Carrington Atlantic away from Blake. Things go awry in \\"Dead Scratch\\" when Fallon is unexpectedly promoted to CEO of the company, and Alexis loses influence over Jeff and Monica, who are determined to take from the Carringtons what they believe is owed to them. During Steven and Sam's wedding, Alexis has a nasty catfight with Cristal, who has discovered the truth about Hank. In order to buy time, Alexis locks Cristal in the stable house and encourages Hank to flee. The stables are later set on fire with the Carringtons trapped inside. Though Michael frees them, Alexis runs back upstairs to free Cristal. Season two In \\"Twenty-Three Skidoo\\", Alexis returns to Carrington Manor after a month-long stay in the hospital for smoke inhalation. Hank reveals he started the fire and threatens to go to the police about Alexis's subterfuge if she does not pay him $1 million. After Alexis has a heated argument with Blake about money, they have sex. In \\"Ship of Vipers\\", Alexis joins forces with Sam to determine if Melissa Daniels is really pregnant. Alexis gives Hank a painting to use as collateral until she can get him the money owed. In \\"The Butler Did It\\", Alexis and Anders are revealed to have had an affair that produced Steven. Fallon kicks Alexis out of the Manor in \\"Snowflakes in Hell\\", and she and Steven sever all ties with their mother. Alexis follows the Carringtons to Paraguay to mend her relationship with Steven, who in turn convinces Fallon to forgive Alexis. In \\"Queen of Cups\\", Hank starts to grow impatient with Alexis, who finds herself competing with Cristal Jennings for Blake's affections. A psychic predicts that Alexis will remarry but that the man will die; Alexis interprets this to be Blake. In \\"That Witch\\", Alexis sabotages Blake and Cristal's Thanksgiving travel plans while also obsessing over Blake's health. She acts as the Good Witch of the North in Fallon's Wizard of Oz fantasy and is later given a check by Fallon to aid in getting her life back together. Alexis gives this check to Hank, officially paying off her debt to him. Before leaving, however, Hank leaves Alexis with a baby. Christmas decorations start going up around the Manor in \\"A Temporary Infestation\\", so Alexis plants the baby in the nativity scene to be discovered by Sam. Alexis moves back into the restored stable house, but her war with Cristal reaches new heights as the two women scheme to drive each other away from the Manor. In the process, Cristal discovers Alexis to be in possession of the baby Jesus from the nativity scene, indicating she knows more about the mysterious baby than she has been letting on. In \\"A Real Instinct for the Jugular\\", Fallon includes Alexis in her wedding planning, but soon discovers her mother has ulterior motives. In exchange for talking Fallon out of trying to obtain the Swan House for her wedding venue, Mimi Rose Prescott has promised Alexis a place in the Peachtree Preservation Society. This leads to a falling out between mother and daughter, and Fallon uninviting Alexis to her wedding. In order to make things right with Fallon, Alexis backs into Mimi with her car to ensure she will not be having her wedding on the same day as Fallon, thus leaving the venue available. Fallon forgives Alexis and re-extends her invitation, though now having decided to have the wedding at the Manor. In \\"Crazy Lady\\", after baby L.B. has been kidnapped, Alexis and Blake make public plea to help find their \\"grandson\\". Alexis later convinces Hank's former accomplice, the mentally unstable Claudia Blaisdel, that he was a figment of her imagination in order to ensure her silence regarding Alexis's criminal activity. Searching for a purpose, Alexis attempts to sell one of her paintings at a gala for Steven's foundation in \\"A Champagne Mood\\". She is less than thrilled to hear that Cristal is pregnant. Alexis feels, sad, unwanted, and replaced by Cristal in \\"The Sight of You\\", and plots Cristal's exile from the Manor once and for all. Alexis discovers that Cristal is unsure about the paternity of her unborn child in \\"Filthy Games\\", and sees to it that this information gets back to Blake. Later, to toy with the situation even further, she calls and invites Cristal's ex-husband Mark Jennings to the Manor. In \\"Even Worms Can Procreate\\", Alexis tries to manipulate Mark's unresolved feelings for Cristal in order to pit him against Blake, only to find herself continually pushed away by everyone around her. Cristal confronts Alexis once the paternity test comes back, confirming that the child is Blake's and insisting Alexis' time at the Manor is over. This sends Alexis over the edge, and she gets drunk, takes one of Blake's handguns, and prepares to commit suicide out by the stables. Just before pulling the trigger, however, she sees Cristal and Mark riding horses in the distance and fires the gun in their direction. Mark is killed, and Cristal is thrown from her horse and dragged. As police investigate the incident in \\"Parisian Legend Has It...\\", Alexis comforts Cristal and pins the crime on Blake's hitman Mack. The real Adam Carrington makes his way to the Manor in \\"Motherly Overprotectiveness\\", sending Alexis into a panic. She rejects Adam's claims and maintains that Hank is her son, all the while disposing of any evidence tying her to Hank's impersonation. Once Adam passes a DNA test, he confronts Alexis, knowing what she did, and she regretfully apologizes. Adam feigns forgiveness but then pushes Alexis's face into her lit fireplace. In \\"Miserably Ungrateful Men\\", Alexis's face is bandaged up and she is unable to speak, and the only people who express any interest in her predicament are Adam and Jeff Colby. Jeff offers to let Alexis recover at his home, but Adam convinces her to stay under his own care at the hospital. Before Alexis is sent in for facial reconstruction surgery, Adam gives the nurse a picture to use as a reference. In \\"How Two-Faced Can You Get\\", the bandages come off and Alexis's face is shaped to resemble Fallon's. Adam unveils Alexis's new face at a masquerade party in \\"Life is a Masquerade Party\\", but Alexis is met with shock and horror from the entire family, particularly Fallon. In \\"This Illness of Mine\\", Alexis is disgusted to learn that Adam is the reason she now has Fallon's face. Alexis makes amends with her daughter before leaving for Europe to have an entirely new face constructed. Alexis asks that Fallon keep her leaving the country a secret from Adam, and also warns her that Adam is dangerous. Season three Alexis returns to testify against Blake in \\"The Sensational Blake Carrington Trial\\", having married Jeff. In \\"The Caviar, I Trust, Is Not Burned\\", she testifies that she saw Blake murder Mack, but Fallon is able to prove that Alexis is lying, resulting in a mistrial. Dominique is especially upset over Jeff's marriage, and confronts Alexis. Later, Dominique takes a public tumble down the courthouse stairs and makes it look like Alexis pushed her. Alexis reaffirms her commitment to help Jeff destroy Blake. In \\"What Sorrows Are You Drowning?\\", Alexis learns that Cristal is investigating Mark's death herself, so Alexis attempts to collect the gun she used to shoot Mark. Realizing that Mack was not Mark's killer, Cristal confronts Alexis. When Alexis confesses, they brawl in the lily pond. In \\"A Wound That May Never Heal\\", Alexis manipulates Adam into helping her and Jeff in their plot against Blake, and convinces Adam to confess to poisoning Jeff on camera as a means for Adam to ingratiate himself to Jeff. Alexis and Jeff use blackmail to force a sale of Carrington Atlantic. Furious that Alexis caused her miscarriage, Cristal pays an assassin to kill Alexis in \\"You See Most Things in Terms of Black & White\\", but Alexis cheats death in \\"That Wicked Stepmother\\" when the car bomb is placed under the wrong SUV. In \\"Up a Tree\\", Alexis coerces Adam into helping an ailing Jeff by procuring experimental drugs not yet approved for Jeff's condition. Jeff refuses any help from Adam, so Alexis administers the drugs without Jeff knowing. Jeff collapses.

Lavelle (January 26, 1949January 24, 2007) represented the 61st Assembly District in the New York State Assembly, which comprised much of the North Shore of Staten Island. Lavelle, a former executive with Met Life, was a champion for the poor and less fortunate. He served as a member of the New York State Charter Commission for Staten Island in 1993, and became Staten Island Democratic Party Chairman in 1999. He was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 2000, filling the seat formerly occupied by Assemblywoman Betty Connelly. He served on a number of committees, including Government Employees, Social Services, Veterans Affairs and Mental Health, among others. Assemblyman Lavelle was known for sponsoring bills calling for the same benefits of those who died in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing as those who died in the 2001 attack and for being an advocate for stronger gun control laws. In addition, Lavelle spent over 20 years working for quality health care by serving on the Community Advisory Board for the Sisters of Charity Health Care System at St. Vincent's Medical Center. He started a monthly recreation program for patients at Sea View Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home and served as Chairman of the Center's Advisory Board.

Based roughly on real-life events, the film recounts the story of Wisconsin teacher Diane Borchardt, who hired teen students first to spy on her cheating husband and later to kill him. The film begins with the murder then traces in flashback the events leading up to it, followed by the subsequent police investigation leading to arrests and eventual murder convictions of both Borchardt and the teens. Plot The film opens with three teenage boys pulling up to the house of Ruben Borchardt (Peter Coyote) early on Easter Sunday in 1994. They break into Ruben's house armed with a shotgun, intending to kill Ruben on the promise of payment. Gathering at the top of the basement steps where Ruben sleeps, the boys draw their shotgun and shoot Mr. Borchardt as he makes his way up the stairs. Having carried out their deed, the three boys flee the scene. Prologue The film cuts to seven months before the shooting, during the Fall of 1993. Diane Kay Borchardt (Ann-Margret) is a seemingly ordinary schoolteacher with a normal life. She has a loving husband, three children, and a lovely house. However, it quickly becomes apparent that she harbors deep mental instability and possible psychosis. While she dotes on and spoils her daughter Regan, she is emotionally and physically abusive towards Ruben and his two children, Brook (Hedy Burress) and Chuck (Tobey Maguire). Ruben married Diane fourteen years prior after his beloved wife Susan (Cynthia Lynch) died in a car crash when Brook and Chuck were young. Realizing his children needed a mother figure in their lives, Ruben married to Diane, only to find himself in a loveless marriage in which Diane constantly abuses him. One day, Ruben goes to a neighbor's house to help him remodel his kitchen, as he is a work-at-home carpenter. There he gets reacquainted with Claire Brown (Leslie Hope), whom he works together with to remodel the kitchen. During the remodeling, Ruben and Claire share their personal stories with each other, becoming increasingly close friends as the project goes on. Later that day, Ruben drops by Diane's clothes shop on account of the fact that Diane failed to pay for Chuck's new glasses, as she had spent it on new shoes for Regan despite previously agreeing to buy the glasses. Diane then accuses Ruben of spoiling his own children and neglecting Regan, and says that he ought to be making more money. Ruben tries to reason with Diane when suddenly, without provocation, Diane hits him in the head with a label gun. Ruben later admits to Claire that his marriage was a mistake. Claire also reveals that she and her husband have also grown apart in recent years. When the project is finished, Ruben admits his true feelings for Claire, and kisses her on impulse. He then leaves her confused, only to return and this time, the two proceed to kiss each other passionately. Upon realizing their feelings for each other, Claire and Ruben start meeting each other secretly, and contemplate leaving their spouses in order to marry. Although Ruben is a devout Christian who opposes divorce, his feelings for Claire remain strong and says he believes they can make it work. Claire agrees to make a decision when she is ready. The Divorce Later, Ruben and the family go to the annual Christmas party at the Church. While Diane is away, Ruben runs into Claire at the dance and the two steal the dance floor, and Claire accepts Ruben's proposal. Diane witnesses this and confronts her husband at home, where he admits he no longer wishes to be married to Diane. Diane makes excuses for her lack of empathy towards Ruben, but Ruben is convinced that their marriage is irreconcilable. Diane drives him away and vows to get even with him. Ruben tells Chuck and Brook about his decision, and the kids admit to their father that Diane has treated them as badly as she treated him, much to Ruben's distress. Ruben goes forth with the divorce proceedings against Diane's wishes. Meanwhile at school, Diane feigns sadness in front of her students to gain sympathy from them. It becomes apparent that she maintains a close relationship with her students in order to get them to do her bidding when she feels fit. One of her closest students, Doug Vest (Christian Campbell) comforts her and Diane lies that her husband physically abuses her in front of their children, and is turning them against her. Diane hugs Doug in her drive for sympathy, saying that Ruben would not do this to her if he knew she had him. After school, Doug meets with his friends Josh Yanke (Jonah Blechman), Cory (Michael Scott Campbell), and Elgin (Aeryk Egan) to discuss \\"messing up\\" Mr. Borchardt. Doug, whose estranged father was physically abusive towards his own mother, says that Ruben's behavior is inexcusable. One day, Ruben invites Claire to his house while Diane is away, and presents her with a necklace as a token of his affections. Unbeknownst to the couple, Cory and Elgin photograph them in the house, and when Diane shows the pictures to Shannon Johnson (Alanna Ubach), another one of her students who assists her in the shop, she declares that she wants Ruben dead. During Christmas break, Diane coaxes Doug into her car, and lets him take it for a spin. She shows him the house and says she'd be willing to let him have the car. She goes on to explain her situation with Ruben, lying to Doug about the true nature of their divorce. She then says that if she were to have Ruben killed, it would have to be someone she trusted, and to his distress, she refers to him. Later, Diane's lawyer informs her that Ruben is seeking sole custody of the house, much to her outrage, even though he is the original proprietor. In retaliation, Diane informs the pastor of their church that Ruben has strayed from the church and violated the sacredness of their marriage. Ruben is informed by the pastor that he is not to take communion at the church for committing adultery. After New Year's Day, Ruben learns that Diane is seeking custody of Chuck as part of her ploy to secure the house, prompting Ruben to confront her. Diane reacts violently and proceeds to physically beat Ruben while Chuck and Brook struggle to stop her. At the divorce proceedings, Ruben gains custody of Chuck and Diane gains sole custody of her shop and Regan. However, to her outrage Ruben gains custody the house. Diane is to vacate the property within one month, and silently promises to enact revenge on Ruben. Later in March, Diane commissions another student Tim (Johnny Strong) to do away with her husband, telling him that the one person she still trusted let her down. Tim tells this to Doug, who immediately feels guilty for turning his back on Diane. Tim also admits that Diane may be contemplating the murder of her husband. Diane later accuses Ruben of stealing her jewellery, when in reality she plans on paying it to Doug to kill her husband. She also tries to secure title to Ruben's life insurance policy. Later that night, Diane approaches Doug and tells him she wants him to kill Ruben, much to Doug's horror. Once again, she makes out Ruben to be the guilty party, claiming that he is taking everything from her. She bribes Doug with her jewellery and cash to carry out the murder, and he gives in to her demands despite his reservations. Doug later commissions Josh and his cousin Michael Maldonado (Freddy Rodriguez) to help him carry out the murder. Michael rejects the proposal, insisting that he receive higher pay to carry out the deed. Diane begins to harass Claire for stealing Ruben away, going so far as to threaten her with death. Claire becomes uneasy as the harassment persists, and insists Diane is dangerous, but Ruben insists he can handle her. At school, Diane again insists that Doug carry out the murder, and lays out her plan to kill Ruben. Doug refuses to do it, until Diane bribes him with $20,000 from Ruben's life insurance policy. Doug gives in to her demands and agrees to pay Josh and Mike part of it and they agree to help him. The Murder While Diane is packing, Ruben confides to Brook that he has a stash of emergency cash for her and Chuck should anything happen to him, and Diane listens in. She also picks a fight with Ruben when she intends to sell Susan's sewing machine, to which Ruben objects. Diane then punches Ruben and beats him when he refuses to fight back. After grabbing her arm in an attempt to disarm her, Diane uses the marks on her arm to claim to the police that Ruben hit her. Ruben denies this and the police tell the couple to separate temporarily. Having planned on this, Diane agrees to leave the house for Easter, and has made plans to stay at Susan's parents' house with Regan. She also takes the family dog away by force. Before leaving, Diane forces Ruben to kiss her in front of the cops, and whispers to him \\"You're dead\\". On the eve of Easter morning, Ruben is wary of Diane's death threat. He tells Claire that should anything happen to him, she is to find another man to make her happy, while insisting that all will be well. Throughout the night, Shannon contemplates warning Ruben of the impending danger, but fails to make the call. In the early morning hours of Easter Sunday, Doug and his two friends break into the house while Ruben prepares for Easter service. They gather at the top of the stairs, where they face Ruben as he goes to wake his son. Mike pulls out a shotgun and fires two rounds into Ruben, fatally wounding him. The boys then flee the scene and dump the shotgun into a vacant lot. Chuck soon wakes up to find his father bleeding to death on the stairs, and calls 911 while Ruben calls Claire. As Ruben fights for his life, he proclaims his love for her and leaves his children in her care. Ruben is rushed to the hospital where the family gathers to learn of his condition. Claire soon shows up to see Ruben, only to discover that he has died. As the family mourns their loss, Diane also learns of the murder, and feigns shock and sadness in front of Sue's parents. They become suspicious of her when she fails to ask any questions about the murder. Meanwhile, Detectives Burstyn (Cliff De Young) and Pike (Dean Norris) are assigned to track down Ruben's killer. When Diane refuses to talk to the police after the murder, she becomes the primary suspect. In the days that follow, Diane deals further insult to her grieving family by threatening to sue the funeral home for proceeding with Ruben's service without her consent, as she had not been present to arrange it. Brook accuses her of killing her father, a charge Diane immediately denies. The funeral soon takes place and the family pays their final respects to Ruben as he is laid to rest. Once again, Diane feigns sorrow in front of the open casket to preserve her innocence. Claire watches the burial from nearby, and soon collapses from shock. The Investigation The police soon discover that the murder weapon was a shotgun, and deduce that the shooter was an amateur, as the gun was of a cheap design. They are later tipped off about the photographs taken by Cory and Elgin, and question the boys about their activities. They learn that Diane shares her personal problems with her class, and is thus able to manipulate them to do as she pleases. Meanwhile, Doug struggles to acquire the money promised to him by Diane. Due to her increasingly suspicious behavior in the case, Diane is denied access to Ruben's life insurance policy. Having grown impatient with Doug, Mike threatens Diane at knife-point and demands that she pay up. Frantic, Diane searches her husband's bedroom for the money he had hidden away, and soon finds a package containing $6,000. She gives $1500 to the boys, who are still not satisfied with their payment. As the case remains at a standstill, Brook meets Claire in the hospital and pleads that she come back to them, as she was more of a mother to them than Diane ever was. Claire blames herself for Ruben's death, but Brook tells her that he was more alive with Claire than he had ever been before. Upon hearing this, Claire is soon able to overcome her personal guilt and becomes an adoptive mother to Chuck and Brook. Meanwhile, Brook has moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where she starts over without Diane in her life. Eventually, she meets a boy named Nick at her new job, and the two soon fall in love. After a night in bed, Brook discovers she is pregnant with Nick's son, and the two agree to marry each other. Doug soon realizes that Diane will never be able to pay up, and informs his friends that he cannot obtain any more money. Meanwhile, Mike admits to his best friend Jeb (Andrew Kavovit) that he had a hand in Ruben's death, albeit without any noteworthy remorse. Jeb is unable to bring himself to confess to the police. Five months after the murder, it becomes apparent to Diane that the cops are on to her, and tries to conceal her guilt. Shannon meets with Doug, and forces him to confess his role in the murder so that she can turn in all evidence to the cops before she commits suicide, making herself out to be the killer in an effort to protect Diane. Diane dissuades her from doing this as it will only lead the police back to her regardless. By the time school restarts, the boys are frustrated by their lack of payment, and struggle to conceal the truth about Ruben's murder. Arrest and Trial Six months into the case, Jeb breaks down and admits to his friend Jay that Mike and Doug were responsible for Ruben's murder. Rather than force Jeb to turn in his best friend, Jay goes to the cops himself and implicates Doug as an accomplice. Doug is brought in for questioning, where he accidentally lets slip that he was in fact involved in Ruben's murder. When Burstyn confronts him on this, Doug makes a full confession, and provides him with the names of his accomplices. Mike and Shannon are arrested, and the two detectives rush to the high school. There, amidst the air of shock and outrage among the students, the police arrest Josh and Diane, with the latter desperately protesting her innocence as she is dragged away in handcuffs. Six months later, Diane has been set free on bail as the court proceeds with the trials. Doug and Mike are both charged with first-degree murder as adults, and face life imprisonment. Josh pleads guilty to his crime in exchange for his testimony, and Shannon is charged with perjury. Josh admits his role in the conspiracy, as well as Doug's role in organizing the attack. Doug reveals the full details of the murder before the trial, and after his testimony, he is sentenced to life imprisonment. Diane is soon rearrested and brought forth to face a series of witnesses, who implicate her as the mastermind of the plot against Ruben. Among these witnesses is Shannon, who feels betrayed by Diane's reluctance to come forth to her defense. Doug also testifies against Diane, admitting that she commissioned him to carry out the murder. After the conclusion of the testimonies, the jury makes its final verdict. To Diane's horror, she is found guilty of first-degree intentional homicide, and breaks down in front of the courtroom as her daughter Regan looks on in despair. Having finally received justice for their father, the Borchardt family, along with Brook's husband and newborn son Ruben, visit Ruben's grave along with Claire. The family reflects on the better days of Ruben's life and welcome Brook's son, named in honor of his grandfather, into their family. In the final scene, Diane is interviewed for a True Crime Documentary, from jail. Now completely delusional, she admits not to know what she's supposed to have learnt 'from this' and that her main concern is whether Ruben had 'time to repent or is he lost forever?' Epilogue The end of the film is followed by an epilogue outlining the sentences faced by the conspirators: SHANNON JOHNSON is found guilty of perjury, and receives an eighty-day jail sentence along with two years probation. JOSHUA YANKE pleaded no contest to second-degree intentional homicide and is sentenced to eighteen years in prison. MICHAEL MALDONADO is found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. He will not be eligible for parole until he has served fifty years of his sentence. DOUGLAS VEST JR. is found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. He will not be eligible for parole until he has served twenty-five years of his sentence. DIANE BORCHARDT is found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, and will not be eligible for parole until she has served 40 years of her sentence, by that time being no less than eighty- six years of age.

In Tobago, WASA maintains the Hillsborough Reservoir along with other freshwater wells to provide municipal drinking water for the country. The purview of the authority extends to the country's sewage treatment plants. History The Water and Sewerage Authority was formed by Act 16 of 1965 and enacted on September 1, 1965. This Act brought together several agencies that were formerly charged with the responsibility of providing water and sewerage facilities to the nation: * The Central Water Distribution Authority * The Port of Spain City Council * The San Fernando Borough Council * The Arima Borough Council * The County Councils * The Water Division of the Ministry of Public Utilities * The Sanitation Division of the Ministry of Public Utilities Infrastructure The authority is the largest public utility in the country. It serves over 92% of the population with pipeborne water through private house connections and standpipes. Since its establishment, water production has increased from 223,000 cubic metres to 650,000 cubic metres in 1990. With respect to wastewater, 30%-40% of the population is served by a central sewerage collection and treatment system. Another 40% of the population are served by cesspit-tank soil-absorption field systems. Those remaining are served by pit latrines (outhouses).

It is now in the public domain. Betty's hula dance was a visual high point of this episode and appears to be closely modeled on the hula dancer that appeared in the opening live action sequence (though the dancer was not \\"topless\\" as Betty is). This is one of the more apparent examples of the rotoscope technique which the Fleisher Studio used for realistic animation. The hula sequence was later reused for Betty's cameo in 1933's Popeye the Sailor and in 1934's Betty Boop's Rise to Fame. Plot After a short live action performance by the Royal Samoans, Bimbo appears on screen playing a ukulele while riding in a motorboat. The motorboat goes faster and faster, until it crashes into a tropical island. Bimbo flies into the air and lands in another boat with a topless (except for a strategically placed lei) and dark-skinned Betty Boop in it. Bimbo and Betty, after nearly falling down a waterfall, are flung from the boat into a clearing surrounded by hostile trees, who torment the two. A group of Samoans appear, but Bimbo disguises himself by painting his face and sticking a bone in his hair, a form of blackface. Bimbo is treated as an honored guest, and Betty dances the hula. A sudden rainstorm washes off Bimbo's disguise, and he and Betty are chased by the Samoans until they reach Betty's canoe and take off down the river. When it seems that they are alone, the two proceed to kiss in private behind an umbrella (with a convenient hole).

After successfully isolating qualities that schools can embody to both educate students and develop teachers, the initiative went beyond the pilot stage and expanded further when 125 more schools joined in September 1999. The number of Beacon Schools in operation more than doubled in September 2000 when 300 more schools took on Beacon status. But, the largest expansion was in September 2001 when a further 425 schools became part of the initiative. The number of Beacon Schools reached a peak of around 1150 by September 2002, and this level of involvement was maintained into 2003. In 2004, Beacon evaluation and funding to Beacon schools was discontinued due to uncertainty with whether the initiative actually improved schools.Smith, Emma. \\"What Happened to the Beacon Schools? Policy Reform and Educational Equity.\\" Oxford Review of Education 41.3 (2015): 367-86. Web. Beacon activity is now decided on a local level, however the principle of schools working together, collaborating to share good practice, remains strong. Methodology of evaluation Beacon schools are evaluated based on certain criteria developed to accurately assess the efficiency of student and teacher development.Peter. \\"Evaluation of the Beacon Schools Initiative.\\" Education-line Databa 8 (n.d.): n. pag. Education-line Database on 08 February 2005. Web. 10 Nov. 2015. The evaluation is based on a questionnaire consisting of closed questions plus an open-ended question encouraging the respondent to provide more detail about their school's Beacon activities. Data from the closed questions was analysed to produce frequencies of data. The responses to the open question were coded, and the data was analyzed using the following main themes: * Benefits for schools * Issues and challenges * Partnership working * Thoughts about the future Distinguishing factors Though the United Kingdom's public sector had implemented many educational reform initiatives in the past, the beacon status initiative was the first of its kind. The initiative is distinguishable from other educational reform initiatives in two important respects. For one, the beacon status initiative was funded and operated by the government rather than non- government organizations. The UK government was responsible for the formation and discontinuation of the beacon status award and the funding associated with it.Smith, Emma. \\"What Happened to the Beacon Schools?

Second, while all award schemes presume, at least tacitly, that the identification of the best and brightest will contribute to learning and improvement, the beacon model gives award winners a formal responsibility to disseminate their practices.Halberstam, David.

Opened in 1947 by entrepreneur E.A. Stephens, it is now owned and operated by Enchantment Group. The East Coast resort on Virginia's Northern Neck, was known for its regional cooking and amenities such as golf and boating ; the Tides Inn slogan \\"Quiet Quality\\" appeared in advertisements in The New Yorker. In 1956, Stephens purchased and restored the decommissioned USS Aquamarine (PYc-7) to be the star attraction at the resort, renaming it Miss Ann after his wife. Andrew Hepburn, in his 1965 book Great Resorts of North America, says that the resort was built on a site called the old Ashburn Farm. Stephens used local timber, including walnut paneling from trees on the farm and cypress paneling from a nearby swamp, hauled to Irvington by oxcart. In the beginning, there were only 47 rooms. From the start, Stephens sought the best antiques for furnishing. Hepburn writes that one of the best early recipes at the resort was the breakfast dish Hangtown fry, made of local oysters and scrambled eggs. The resort had a number of yearly traditions including a Frostbite Regatta and Fourth of July fireworks. The poolside restaurant was known as the Bubble Club. The resort had an eagle theme; not only was an eagle on the Tides Inn logo but the hotel's 1976 golf course, designed by George Cobb and John LaFoy, was named the Golden Eagle. In the early days, due to local liquor laws the restaurant and hotel were not able to sell alcohol to guests. However, because private clubs were not bound by the same constraints Stephens formed the Chesapeake Club, a name still used by the hotel. Yachtsmen and local patrons were invited to join and paid a nominal yearly due. Transient guests could join during their stay for $1 extra per day. After acquisition by Enchantment Group in 2001, the property underwent an $18 million renovation, reopening in 2002. In 2008, Miss Ann was sold. The resort has a total of 70 guest rooms (including suites), a full-service spa, along with a 60-slip marina and a par-72 championship golf course, the Golden Eagle.

He is generally regarded as a puppet of Caesar, having a long friendship with the Dictator. Biography Early life He was the son of Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus. Career In 54 BC, Vatia was praetor. As praetor he opposed Gaius Pomptinus in his endeavour to obtain a triumph. At the start of the civil war, Vatia defected from the optimates to Caesar. Caesar made him his colleague as consul for 48 BC. Caesar soon left Rome to fight Pompey in Greece and left Vatia in command of the city. In March 48, praetor Marcus Caelius Rufus began talking of abolishing all debt in the city, as even the upper classes had begun to feel the pressure of shortage of money; even Cicero's wife Terentia was forced to sell most of her jewelry. Caelius, however, had no jurisdiction on the standing of debts, his only magistracy being in the administration of foreigners in Rome; instead, debts fell under Gaius Trebonius' jurisdiction. After Caelius set up a tribunal within earshot of Trebonius in the Forum for the second time, Vatia Isauricus himself went to the Forum to confront the rogue magistrate, followed by a retinue of fasces-wielding guards. After a heated argument on the tribunal, Vatia Isauricus famously pulled an axe out of one of the fasces and destroyed Caelius's wooden magistrate's chair. Caelius and Vatia Isauricus nearly came to blows, and the mob became so confrontational with the Consul that the guards actually needed to unsheathe their axes to ward them off. Caelius made fun of Vatia Isauricus by holding up his repaired magistrate's chair, which was held together with leather straps. Famously, Vatia Isauricus was beaten by his father with a strap of leather, which was shameful for the family name, though Vatia Isauricus himself claimed it had toughened him up. Caelius repeatedly escaped Vatia Isauricus, and was not arrested but went to join Titus Annius Milo in an insurrection against Caesar, and were both captured and executed. Later life and family Vatia married Junia Prima.Marjorie Lightman, Benjamin Lightman; A to Z of Ancient Greek and Roman Women - page: 176Susan Treggiari; Servilia and her Family - page: 7 After Caesar's murder, Vatia took the side of the Senate against Mark Antony. When Octavian, to whom Vatia's daughter Servilia was engaged to be married, deserted the cause of the Senate and made peace with Antony, Vatia deserted the cause of the Senate as well. On the formation of the Triumvirate, Octavian broke his engagement with Servilia in order to marry Clodia, the daughter of Fulvia, the wife of Antony. As compensation for this injury, Vatia was made consul in 41 BC with Lucius Antonius as his colleague. Servilia seems to have married Lepidus the Younger, the son of the triumvir.Weigel, Richard D, Lepidus: The Tarnished Triumvir, Routledge, New York, 1992, p.96/ See also * Second Triumvirate * Servilia (gens) References Category:Roman Republican consuls Category:Senators of the Roman Empire Category:Senators of the Roman Republic Vatia Isauricus, Publius Category:1st-century BC Romans ","title":"Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (consul 48 BC)"},{"id":"7094992","text":"The Treaty of Fulda was signed on November 2, 1813 at Fulda, Hesse, in Germany.

The ecoregion is located in the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, including the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians and the Blue Ridge Mountains. It covers an area of about in: northeast Alabama and Georgia, northwest South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and central West Virginia and Pennsylvania; and small extensions into Kentucky, New Jersey, and New York. They are one of the world's richest temperate deciduous forests in terms of biodiversity; there are an unusually high number of species of both flora and fauna, as well as a high number of endemic species. The reasons for this are the long-term geologic stability of the region, its long ridges and valleys which serve both as barrier and corridors, and their general north- south alignment which allowed habitats to shift southward during ice ages. The mountains also contain a large variety of diverse landscapes, microclimates and soils all constituting microhabitats allowing many refugia areas and relict species to survive and thrive. Climate The climate varies from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. Summers are hot at lower elevations, warm at higher elevations. Winters are cold at higher elevations and cool at lower elevations. Flora In terms of biodiversity, the only comparable temperate deciduous forest regions in the world are in central China, Japan and in the Caucasus Mountains. Both the Appalachians (along with the neighbouring Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion) and central China contain relict habitats of an ancient forest that was once widespread over the Northern Hemisphere. There are species, genera, and families of plants that occur only in these two locations. The Great Smoky Mountains are particularly rich in biodiversity. The Appalachians are home to 158 different species of tree, more than anywhere else in North America. There are two main types of forest; deciduous oak forest at low elevations (between 250m and 1350m), and coniferous spruce-fir forest above that. Until the 1930s the oaks were mixed with American chestnut but these were largely wiped out by the chestnut blight fungus in the early 1900s. Cove forests Cove forests occur in coves and on low north- and east-facing slopes in the southern Blue Ridge and central Appalachian Mountains. They are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the country. Typical trees of these forests are sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), Carolina silverbell (Halesia tetraptera), tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), red maple (Acer rubrum), white oak (Quercus alba), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), yellow buckeye (Aesculus flava), and basswood (Tilia americana). Oaks gain numbers on drier sites. Low-elevation pine forests Southern Appalachian low- elevation pine forests occur on a variety of topographic and landscape positions, including ridgetops, upper- and mid-slopes, and in lower elevations (generally below ) such as mountain valleys. These forests are dominated by shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana). Pitch pine (Pinus rigida) may sometimes be present. Hardwoods are sometimes abundant, especially dry-site oaks such as southern red oak (Quercus falcata), chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), but also pignut hickory (Carya glabra), red maple (Acer rubrum), and others. The shrub layer may be well-developed, with hillside blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), or other acid-tolerant species most characteristic. Herbs are usually sparse but may include narrowleaf silkgrass (Pityopsis graminifolia) and goat-rue (Tephrosia virginiana). Oak forests Southern Appalachian oak forests, widespread in the southeastern United States, occur on dry, upland sites on southern and western aspects and ridgetops. The composition of these forests varies throughout their range but often includes chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), eastern black oak (Quercus velutina), white oak, (Quercus alba), and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). Hickories such as bitternut (Carya cordiformis), shagbark (Carya ovata), and mockernut (Carya tomentosa), are found here, as are black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), red maple (Acer rubrum), white pine (Pinus strobus), and white ash (Fraxinus americana).

They are often found on deep soils in a variety landscapes within their range. Trees are mainly oaks and hickories, with other species less abundant. Oaks include white oak (Quercus alba), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus stellata), chinkapin oak (Quercus muehlenbergii), and Shumard oak (Quercus shumardii). Hickories include shagbark hickory (Carya ovata). Other trees can be sugar maple (Acer saccharum), eastern red-cedar (Juniperus virginiana), or pines. Dry oak forests and woodlands The Allegheny-Cumberland dry oak forest and woodland forest system is found on ridges in the southern Ridge and Valley. The forests are typically dominated by white oak (Quercus alba), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), with lesser amounts of red maple (Acer rubrum), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), and mockernut hickory (Carya tomentosa). A few shortleaf pines (Pinus echinata) or Virginia pines (Pinus virginiana) may occur, particularly adjacent to escarpments or following fire. Sprouts of chestnut (Castanea dentata) can often be found where it was formerly a common tree. Fall colors near Asheville, North Carolina. Dry oak‚Äìpine forests Central Appalachian dry oak‚Äìpine forests occur on dry sites with loamy to sandy soils. A mix of oak and pine tree species dominate the canopy, typically chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), and white pine (Pinus strobus), but sometimes white oak (Quercus alba) or scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). Varying amounts of oaks and pines can result in oak forests, mixed oak‚Äìpine forests, or small pine forests. Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) live in the midstory and hillside blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), and mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) are common in the understory, where they can form a dense layer. Dry‚Äìmesic oak forests Northeastern interior dry‚Äìmesic oak forests cover large areas at low and middle elevations, typically on flat to gently rolling terrain. Red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Quercus alba), and black oak (Quercus velutina) are common oaks in this habitat. Other trees include hickories (Carya spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), white ash (Fraxinus americana), tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black cherry (Prunus serotina), black birch (Betula lenta), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), and American elm (Ulmus americana). Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) is a common understory tree. Pine-oak rocky woodland Central Appalachian pine-oak rocky woodlands occur on lower-elevation hilltops, outcrops, and rocky slopes and have a patchy or open aspect. Pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana) are common within their respective ranges. These pines are often mixed with dry-site oaks such as chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), bear oak (Quercus ilicifolia), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). Sprouts of chestnut (Castanea dentata) can also be found. In the northeast, eastern red-cedar (Juniperus virginiana) or hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) are sometimes important. In the understory, some areas have a fairly well-developed heath shrub layer, others a graminoid layer, the latter particularly common under deciduous trees such as oaks. Montane oak forests Montane oak forests occur on exposed ridges and on south- to west-facing slopes at middle elevations. Soils are thin and nutrient-poor and trees are often stunted and wind-flagged. Northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and white oak (Quercus alba) are common, as are sprouts of American chestnut (Castanea dentata). Winterberry (Ilex montana), flame azalea (Rhododendron calendulaceum), catawba rhododendron (Rhododendron catawbiense), and great rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) are common shrubs. Montane pine forests and woodlands These forests and woodlands are found on exposed ridges, clifftops, and south- and west-facing slopes. They occur at elevations between on often rocky ground. The underlying rock is acidic and sedimentary or metasedimentary (e.g., quartzites, sandstones and shales). The soil is shallow, arid, and infertile. Dead wood, ericaceous shrubs, and a thick layer of poorly decomposed plant litter make this habitat very fire-prone. Most examples are dominated by table mountain pine (Pinus pungens), often with pitch pine (Pinus rigida) or Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), and occasionally with Carolina hemlock (Tsuga caroliniana) and chestnut oak (Quercus prinus). This habitat takes the form of patchy to open woodlands, although closed-canopy may also be found. Northern hardwood forests Northern hardwood forests occur in cool, mesic habitats found above on north- and east-facing slopes of the southern Appalachians. Oak forests are often found nearby, either at lower elevations or in more exposed areas. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum), beech (Fagus grandifolia), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), and yellow buckeye (Aesculus flava) dominate but are sometimes joined by the conifers eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), and red spruce (Picea rubens). Black cherry (Prunus serotina) and white basswood (Tilia heterophylla) are occasionally abundant. Red oak (Quercus rubra) may be present but is not dominant. Areas where beech is dominant are known as beech gaps. Hemlock‚Äìnorthern hardwood forests Hemlock‚Äìnorthern hardwood forests are found in deep coves, moist flats, and ravines from Virginia and West Virginia northward. They include yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), mountain maple (Acer spicatum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and beech (Fagus grandifolia). These trees are sometimes joined by hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) or white pine (Pinus strobus). Spruce-fir forests Uncommon but significant are montane and allied spruce and southern Appalachian spruce-fir forests. These occur only on the highest peaks and ridges, where the soils are poor, the growing season short, and moisture comes from rain, snow, and fog. Red spruce, Fraser fir, yellow birch, mountain ash, and mountain maple identify these forests, while hobblebush and bearberry occur in the understory. Balds Appalachian balds are areas covered by native grasses or dense shrubs that occur only on some high-elevation summits and slopes. Bogs Appalachian bogs are boreal ecosystems, which occur in many places in the Appalachians, particularly the Allegheny and Blue Ridge subranges.https://www.fws.gov/southeast/pubs/mtbog.pdfhttps://www.fws.gov/refuge/mountain_bogs/ Though popularly called bogs, many of them are technically fens.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF0QNPA8IsM&index;=32&list;=PLnN7OGI1bJ88pzzjPYF-U6pgYTwj_8nHe Sods Sods is a term used in the Allegheny Mountains of eastern West Virginia for a mountaintop meadow or bog, in an area that is otherwise generally forested. The term is similar to that of an Appalachian bald.Wilderness Committee, West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, The Dolly Sods Area ‚Äî 32,000 Acres in and Adjacent to the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia, 4th edition; Revised Sept 1973, pg 7. Fauna Endangered or threatened species of the Appalachians include some snails and salamanders, the red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), Virginia big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus), the red wolf (Canis rufus) and the spruce-fir moss spider (Microhexura montivaga). The limestone caves of the Appalachians are important habitat for bats, invertebrates, fish and salamanders including 34 species of lungless salamander, more than anywhere else on earth. Threats View from Little Bald Knob on the Wild Oak Trail. The forests have been altered by logging and clearance for agriculture, urban and industrial development (including mining) with only small patches of original forest remaining, the largest of which is in the Great Smoky Mountains; nearly all of Shenandoah National Park, for example, is regrown forest but still vital habitat for wildlife. The spruce and fir forests of the highlands have been logged particularly intensively and in many cases have not regenerated leaving areas of Appalachian balds heath. Also, as large predators such as wolves and cougars have been removed, the forests are now being overgrazed by deer. Plants and animals are also threatened by introduced species including the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), balsam woolly adelgid (A. piceae) and the Discula destructiva that affects dogwoods and is similar to chestnut blight.

She was the first such ship to be laid down, although the British armoured frigate was completed first. The ship participated in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, but saw no combat. She was served as a gunnery training ship from 1885 to 1908 before she was hulked the following year and became a barracks ship in Toulon. Couronne was scrapped in 1934, over 70 years after she was completed. Design and description Gunnery practice on Couronne Designed by the French naval architect Camille Audenet as an iron-hulled version of the s, Couronne was also intended to fight in the line of battle, unlike the first British ironclads.Gardiner, p. 54 The ship was classified as an armoured frigate because she only had a single gun deck and her traditional disposition of guns arrayed along the length of the hull also meant that she was a broadside ironclad. The ship was long,Gille, p. 23 with a beam of . She had a maximum draft of , a depth of hold of and displaced . The ship's metacentric height of meant that she rolled less and was a better sea boat than the Gloires.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 286 Her gun ports were slightly higher above the waterline than those of her predecessors, , and Couronne took aboard less water as well. She had a crew of 570 officers and enlisted men. The ship had a single horizontal return connecting-rod compound steam engine that drove a six-bladed, propeller using steam provided by eight Indret oval boilers for a designed speed of . Figures for the engine's designed power vary wildly, from ,de Balincourt & Vincent-Br√©chignac, Part II, p. 24Silverstone, p. 61 but Couronne reached from during her sea trials. She carried a maximum of of coal which allowed her to steam for at a speed of . The details of Couronnes sailing rig are not precisely known, but presumably she was fitted with a light barquentine rig with three masts like that of the Gloire-class ships. It is also unknown if she had the same multiple changes of rigging as those ships.de Balincourt & Vincent-Br√©chignac, Part I, p. 14 Couronne was armed with 36 Mod√®le 1860 rifled breech-loading guns, 30 of which were positioned on the single gun deck in the broadside. The remaining 4 guns were placed on the upper deck as chase guns. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of only and proved to be ineffective against armour.Gardiner, p. 159 The ship was rearmed multiple times during her career, the first of which was the replacement of the chase guns by four howitzers in 1864 and the replacement of the rest of the guns by improved Mod√®le 1864 guns. The ship was subsequently rearmed with 16 Mod√®le 1864 or 1866 guns on her main deck and six 164.7-millimetre guns on the upper deck as chase guns. Her final armament configuration before she became a gunnery training ship in 1881 was eight Mod√®le 1870 guns and four 194-millimetre Mod√®le 1870 guns on the main deck. A pair of guns and a dozen 5-barrelled Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted on the upper deck. Couronnes wrought iron hull was completely protected by armour plates 120 millimetres thick. The armour backing consisted of two layers of teak, totaling in thickness, an iron lattice work thick, and the side of the hull. The ship had a conning tower with armour thick and of armour underneath the wooden upper deck.  Construction and service  A lithograph postcard of Couronne sailing in heavy seas Ordered on 4 March 1858, Couronne was laid down at the Arsenal de Lorient on 14 February 1859, launched on 28 March 1861 and commissioned on 2 February 1862 at a cost of 6,018,885 francs. On 19 June 1864, Couronne played an incidental role in the Battle of Cherbourg as she escorted the Confederate commerce raider out of French territorial waters to her fight with .Luraghi, p. 319 While assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, the ship made a port visit in August 1865 to Brest where the fleet hosted the British Channel Fleet. A few days later the French fleet made a reciprocal visit to Portsmouth where it was hosted by the Channel Fleet.Jones, pp. 35, 37 On 1 March 1867, Couronne was driven ashore in the √éles d'Hy√®res, Var in a storm. Several lives were lost. Portrait of Couronne as a gunnery training ship. During the Franco-Prussian War the ship was assigned to Vice Admiral L√©on Martin Fourichon's squadron that blockaded German ports in the Heligoland Bight in August and September 1870.Wilson, vol. 1, pp. 275‚Äì276 The four German ironclads at Wilhelmshaven sortied in search of the French squadron in early August before the French arrived and in mid-SeptemberSondhaus, p. 102 after the French were forced to abandon the blockade for lack of coal.Wilson, vol. 1, p. 276 Couronne returned to Toulon on 10 December. In 1876, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. From 1881 to 1885, Couronne was reconstructed to serve as a gunnery training ship, replacing Souverain:Le Souverain (1819 ‚Äì 1885), Nicolas Mioque her armour was replaced by wood of the same thickness, two boilers were removed and her propeller was replaced. Her rigging was replaced by a full ship rig and iron spar deck and poop decks were fitted which gave her the appearance of a steam ship of the line of the type. The ship was rearmed with an assortment of guns of various calibres for training purposes, replacing Souverain in this role. Her crew and trainees numbered 1200 officers and enlisted men. Couronne was replaced as a gunnery training ship on 1 December 1908 and disarmed on 1 September 1909. She was subsequently converted to a floating barracks at Toulon until she was scrapped in 1934.

It gained Royal Assent on 30 November 2000. The Act extends a privilege to Ireland whereby persons elected to sit in its houses of parliament are eligible, if elected/appointed, to sit in a house of the parliament of the United Kingdom also. This privilege is extended to all countries in the Commonwealth of Nations (of which Ireland is not a member). Summary of effects of the law The Act amended the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the Northern Ireland Assembly Disqualification Act 1975, which had previously disqualified any person who was a member of a legislature outside the Commonwealth from becoming a member of the Commons or the Assembly, to remove the disqualification from members of the Oireachtas (the Parliament of Ireland). A specific provision of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 had permitted members of the Seanad √âireann to sit in the Assembly; this section was now repealed as obsolete. It amended the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to state that any Assembly member who was also a minister in the Government of Ireland, or the chair of a committee of the D√°il √âireann, Seanad √âireann or Oireachtas, was not permitted to hold ministerial office or sit on the Northern Ireland Policing Board. In addition, they were not permitted to be the chair of any statutory committee of the Assembly, or members of the Northern Ireland Assembly Commission. SDLP politician Seamus Mallon was appointed to the Irish Senate but then lost his seat in the then Northern Ireland Assembly after a challenge by Unionists. The amendment in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 rectified this position but the new Act went further. Background to the Commonwealth privilege All members of sovereign parliaments of Commonwealth countries have a legal entitlement, if they are elected/appointed to sit in a House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, to take up their seat in the British Parliament. This is a privilege extended to Commonwealth countries under British law. Notwithstanding that this privilege in favour of Commonwealth countries for many years, no member of a Commonwealth parliament has ever been a member of the United Kingdom parliament as well. Ireland withdrew from the British Commonwealth of Nations in April 1949. With its departure from the Commonwealth, Ireland lost the privilege extended to members of Commonwealth parliaments. Even though the United Kingdom passed the Ireland Act 1949, providing that Ireland would not be treated as a \\"foreign country\\" for the purposes of British law, the privilege Ireland had lost was not restored to it. As such, an anomaly between the way Ireland was treated and the way Commonwealth countries were treated arose. Nevertheless, the issue attracted no attention over the years. Background to why the Commonwealth privilege was extended to Ireland Ireland and the United Kingdom concluded the Belfast Agreement concerning the constitutional position of Northern Ireland in 1998. Among the matters agreed in that Agreement were that Ireland would remove its constitutional claim to the territory of Northern Ireland. With effect from 2 December 1999, this Irish claim was dropped. The Government of the United Kingdom moved quickly to remove the aforementioned anomaly and introduced legislation to extend the privilege of members of the sovereign Irish parliament to also, if elected/appointed, take up seats in the parliament of the United Kingdom. Heated parliamentary debate The changes proposed under the Disqualification Bill 2000 were the subject of heated debate in the British House of Lords. The Government minister stated that:House of Lords Debate 2000 > The constitutional changes made by the Irish Government are historic and > irreversible. They represent the giving up of what has always been regarded > in Ireland as very important constitutional provisions....When the Irish > constitutional changes took effect on 2nd December, we believed it only > right to follow those changes by removing in this Bill one of the last > distinctions made in domestic legislation between Ireland and those other > countries with which we have an equally warm and special relationship > through the Commonwealth. Unionist Members first proposed an amendment to the bill concerning the name used for the Irish state. They argued that the term \\"the Republic of Ireland\\" should be used, and not \\"Ireland\\". However, the Government did not accept this, stating (see also Names of the Irish state): > [T]he term \\"Ireland\\" is used correctly, is unambiguous and is in accordance > with established practice. Since the conclusion of the British-Irish > agreement in 1998 it has been the practice of both the British Government > and Irish Government to refer to \\"Ireland\\" rather than \\"the Republic of > Ireland\\" when the reference is in an international context. To accept the > amendments would make the drafting of the Bill inconsistent with the > practice of the Government in other legislation. Therefore, we oppose the > amendment moved.... Next, the substance of the bill was debated at length. Opposition peers argued that permitting a member of the parliament of Ireland to simultaneously serve as a member of the parliament of the United Kingdom left room for a dangerous conflict of interest to emerge. They argued that this law would benefit only Sinn F√©in and that that party might use the new law to permit it to send its Members of Parliament to sit in D√°il √âireann and speak for their constituents in the United Kingdom in D√°il √âireann and that \\"would be huge step towards a United Ireland by stealth\\". These arguments were not accepted. However, the arguments that Irish government ministers and chairmen of committees of the Irish parliament should not be permitted to serve as ministers in the United Kingdom were accepted.

Like most areas of New England, Tolland County is (and has been at all times since well before the 20th century) entirely divided into incorporated municipalities. There is no unincorporated territory. There are three types of municipalities in Connecticut: towns, boroughs and cities. As in the other New England states, towns are the basic unit of municipal government. Boroughs overlay towns and assume responsibility for some municipal services within their boundaries. Boroughs are not found in any of the other New England states, and are not very common in Connecticut today, although they were somewhat more numerous in the past. A number of boroughs have disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert to full town control. Cities also overlay towns. This is different from the other New England states, where cities are a different type of municipality equivalent to a town (this difference is related to cities having originally developed in Connecticut from the borough model). Most current cities are coextensive with their parent town, however, such that the entire municipality functions as a city. In practice, these cities are really no different from cities in the other New England states. It is also possible for a city in Connecticut to overlay part, but not all, of a town. There are currently only one or two examples, but it was a more common arrangement in the past. Many of today‚Äôs coextensive cities were non-coextensive at one time. As with boroughs, a number of non-coextensive cities have also disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert to full town control. The main tables below show municipalities at the town level. For any census, adding up the totals for each town should yield the county total. In cases where a community encompassed a coextensive city, the tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series mark the community as a city; however, there have never been any coextensive cities in Tolland County.

Notes 2000 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 2000 census totals subsequent to their initial release. The 2000 total for the town of Mansfield was originally reported as 20,720; for the town of Tolland 13,146; and for the town of Coventry, 11,504. The totals were later revised to those shown in the list above. This was apparently done to correct assignment errors between these towns; the collective population of the three towns is the same using either set of figures, so the county total was not affected.

It is a sequel to the 1993 film Cyborg Cop, and stars David Bradley, Morgan Hunter, Jill Pierce, and Victor Melleney.  Plot  Crime boss Jesse Starkraven leads his gang in an attack on a drug den not cooperating with Starkraven's demands; the assault quickly turns into a hostage situation when police arrive. Renegade DEA agent Jack Ryan arrives and attempts to negotiate with Starkraven, however this fails when Starkraven recognizes Ryan as the officer who killed his brother Harlan during a crime some time prior. Starkraven kills several hostages including Ryan's partner before he is finally captured. Subsequently, Starkraven is convicted of killing a cop and sentenced to death. While awaiting his sentence on death row, Starkraven is kidnapped by government agents under the guise of a prison transfer. He is taken into the custody of the \\"Anti-Terrorism Group\\" and converted into a cyborg alongside several other test subjects. Now dubbed \\"Spartacus\\" by the scientists, he is meant to lead the army of cyborg soldiers. Meanwhile, Ryan learns of Starkraven's apparent escape and begins conducting an investigation to find him against the orders of his boss, Captain Salerno. He collaborates with former sheriff Sam Pickens, who is still well respected in the community even after being removed from office for looking too far into the ATG's activity. During a party to celebrate the success of the project, head scientist Dr. Owns takes a woman into the room where Spartacus and the other cyborgs are awaiting activation. While they have a romantic encounter, Spartacus suddenly awakens and attacks them, killing the woman while taking Owns hostage. Spartacus seizes and destroys all but one control bracelet, which he keeps for himself to give himself control over the other cyborgs. He has the other cyborgs kill everyone at the party by burning down the building before leaving in a truck with Owns held hostage for a second facility, where more cyborgs are being created. ATG project leader Liz McDowell arrives the next day to review the incident and attempts to track down Spartacus quietly. However, Ryan's investigation brings him to her attention. She sends agents to follow him, but he swiftly dispatches them. Later, he breaks into an ATG office to gather information. He is detected by dogs and confronted by security guards, but escapes after discovering proof that Starkraven was taken by the ATG for conversion into a cyborg. Meanwhile, Spartacus and some of the other cyborgs travel to a gas station to steal fuel for their recharging generators. Ryan arrives and saves a woman and young boy from them, but is defeated by Spartacus and nearly killed, but he survives when authorities arrive and critically damage Spartacus, forcing the cyborgs to retreat. Ryan is arrested and brought before McDowell, who warns him not to interfere with the ATG. He subsequently escapes from her men and travels to Pickens' home in order to prepare for an assault on Spartacus's headquarters. Spartacus announces his intention to conquer cities and convert all humans into cyborgs, establishing an empire with himself as the leader, and dispatches two cyborgs to kill Ryan. Ryan manages to defeat and destroy them, but not before they kill Pickens. McDowell arrives and is convinced by Ryan to team up with him, providing the weaponry necessary to destroy Spartacus. The two arm themselves and travel to the facility where the cyborgs are hiding, destroying a number of them on their way to the lab. Once they get there, Spartacus appears on a video screen and reveals that he has taken Ryan's son hostage. The cyborgs bring Ryan and McDowell before Spartacus, who tells them he will turn Ryan's son into a cyborg before converting them as well. Ryan overpowers the cyborgs, frees his son and fights Spartacus, managing to steal the control bracelet and deactivate the other cyborgs. Spartacus is dropped into electric cables by a magnet, and is killed when Ryan pours liquid onto him, electrocuting him. Ryan, his son and McDowell flee the facility before bombs they set earlier detonate, destroying it.

The name of the district was derived from an area which was developed in the post-war period as a new suburb town of Jakarta, Kebayoran Baru. Kebayoran Baru was the last residential area to be developed by the Dutch colonial administration. The urban planning was laid in a concept of the Garden city movement, consisting of a well-planned residential area, a shopping center, and a business district, supported with civic facilities e.g. schools, places of worship, hospitals, and parks. Many important governmental institutions are located in Kebayoran Baru, such as the Indonesia Stock Exchange building, the ASEAN Secretariat building, the Criminal Investigation Agency of the National Police, and the City Hall of South Jakarta. Sudirman Central Business District is also located in Kebayoran Baru sub-district. Toponym Kebayoran Baru means \\"New Kebayoran\\". The word kebayoran is derived from kabayuran, meaning \\"stockpiles of bayur wood (Pterospermum javanicum)\\".Menteng dan Kebayoran Baru, Nostalgia Kota Taman Tropis Kabayuran or Kebayuran refers to the name of a settlement Kampung Kabayuran (older Dutch spelling Kamp. Kabajoeran), located outside Batavia on the west bank of Grogol River. The settlement was located near an area where stockpiles of timber (including bayur wood) were established to be transported to Batavia via the river. Bayur wood is known for its strength and resistance to termite attack.https://www.scribd.com/doc/6516621/Asal-Usul-Nama-Tempat-Di-Jakarta The Kampung Kabayuran settlement thrived in the early 19th-century but has since been urbanized. This settlement was located roughly on what is now the Kebayoran Railway Station, currently located in the district of Kebayoran Lama. Government As a district (Indonesian kecamatan), the area of Kebayoran Baru is larger than the historic Kebayoran Baru satellite city, including the southern area of Kebayoran Baru and the Sudirman Central Business District to the northeast. The rough boundaries of Kebayoran Baru district are Sudirman Avenue to the northwest, Gatot Subroto Road to the northeast, Krukut River to the east, Cipete Utara Road - Haji Nawi Road to the south, and Grogol River to the west. The district of Kebayoran Baru is divided into ten kelurahan or administrative villages: *Selong - area code 12110 *Gunung - area code 12120 *Kramat Pela - area code 12130 *Gandaria Utara - area code 12140 *Cipete Utara - area code 12150 *Pulo - area code 12160 *Melawai - area code 12160 *Petogogan - area code 12170 *Rawa Barat - area code 12180 *Senayan - area code 12190 Kebayoran satellite city This subsection focuses on the area of Kebayoran Baru that was once the Kebayoran Baru satellite city. History Dutch East Indian Shell employees The development of Kebayoran Baru satellite town was very quick. The 730 ha land in Kebayoran was initially planned as a new airport, established to replace Kemayoran Airport (1940) whose location blocked the development of Batavia eastward. This plan was replaced with a plan for a satellite town for Batavia, the Kebajoran. The first idea for the satellite town was started in July 1948 and was immediately approved in September 1948. The new satellite town is located relatively close to Tanah Abang - Serpong railway line, enabling the transport of building construction material to the Kebajoran. Following the approval of the plan, the colonial government began the land acquisition process for Kebayoran satellite town. On January 17, 1949, the land acquisition process for Kebayoran was completed. In February 1949, the first draft of the town's master plan was completed by Moh. Soesilo. Construction of the master plan followed immediately in March 1949, just a month later. Moh. Soesilo was an urban planner in the Centraal Planologisch Bureau and a student of Thomas Karsten, a renowned Dutch engineer who contributed to the urban planning and the development of architecture in colonial Indonesia. Soesilo designed the master plan for Kebayoran Baru and Pejompongan in 1948; these are the first urban center in the country to be designed by a native Indonesian. The first laying of the stone was done on March 18, 1949.http://alifuru.tripod.com/jakarta/ts_ibukota.htm# The first area to be designed is now located around Kebayoran station, on the east side of Grogol River. The construction was done by a specially-established Central Foundation for Reconstruction (, CSW), whose office was established near the current Attorney General building (Kejaksaan Agung) on June 1, 1948. The development of Kebayoran Baru satellite town was completed in 1955.Kebayoran Baru, Riwayatmu Dulu , Kompas 29 Juli 2006. The satellite town was connected to the center of Jakarta via Thamrin and Sudirman, both constructions started in 1949 and was finally opened in 1953. Before the completion of these roads, car access to Kebayoran Baru was via Jalan Palmerah Utara and Jalan Palmerah Selatan (now Jalan Asia Afrika). Urban planning Kebayoran Baru is designed following the principle of a garden city. Kebayoran Baru is a well- planned district, both in term of its urban planning and its infrastructure. Sudirman Avenue is the main road, which connects Kebayoran Baru to the city center in Central Jakarta. The southern quarter of the Semanggi Interchange is located in Kebayoran Baru. The total planning area is 730 ha, with about 45% was allocated for the residential area, 16% for green space, and 14% for shops and other buildings. The remaining 25% of Kebayoran Baru area was allocated for roads. City blocks of Kebayoran Baru The Al-Azhar Great Mosque was the landmark of Blok K, which originally consisted of a Central Park (Taman Pusat), a grand open space for public use. In the 1970s, Kebayoran Baru's Central Park ceased to exist with the construction of government office buildings in the 1970s. The Japanese cultural festival Ennichisai is held yearly in Blok M, the commercial center of Kebayoran Baru. Kebayoran Baru is divided into several blocks (Indonesian blok) from A to S. Today the block names of Kebayoran Baru has been largely forgotten, however some of the names linger in the name of the public facility within the urban block. Below is the list of Kebayoran Baru blocks and its landmarks. *Blok A is roughly bounded by Jalan Panglima Polim Raya to the west, Jalan Petogogan to the east, Jalan Ketimun I to the south and Jalan Kramat Pela to the north.

The area is now part of Gunung Administrative Village. *Blok G is located northwest of Blok F. The relatively isolated block consists of residential area north of Jalan Pakubuwono, e.g. Jalan Martimbang and Jalan Ophir. Initially designed as a peripheral residential area surrounded by the green riparian zone of Grogol River's, during the course of time, the riparian zone trees of River Grogol has been occupied by new housings caused by lack of governmental control. Blok G is currently part of Gunung Administrative Village. *Blok H marks the western part of the northern entrance to Kebayoran Baru residential area.

It was allocated for public facilities and institutions - such as the Great Mosque (now Al-Azhar Great Mosque), the Banknote Factory (now Perum Peruri), and the ASEAN Secretariat Office - surrounding a Central Park (Taman Pusat). This Central Park was maintained as a park only until the late 1970s, when it is converted into government facilities e.g. the high-rise complex of the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing. Blok K is bounded by Jalan Sisingamangaraja to the west, Jalan Pattimura to the east, and Jalan Trunojoyo to the south. It is now part of Selong Administrative Village. *Blok L is marked by Jalan Sultan Hasanuddin - Jalan Iskandarsyah Raya to the southwest, Jalan Tirtayasa to the southeast, Jalan Gunawarman to the east, Jalan Kertanegara to the north, and Jalan Pattimura to the west.

The area of Jalan Kebalen was originally allocated for public housing (perumahan rakyat). During the course of years, the riverbank of River Krukut in Blok S area was occupied by settlements, reducing the width of the river Krukut which causing annual flooding problems in Jakarta. In 2015, the government of Jakarta demolished some of the illegal riverbank settlements of River Krukut in Blok S in an attempt to widen the river. Blok S is currently part of Rawa Barat Administrative Village. Post-war architecture Most buildings in Kebayoran Baru were designed following the principle of functionalism, that is making use of the latest building material (reinforced concrete) and taking into consideration the principle of tropical design - to maximize natural lighting while minimizing the heat without the use of electricity. Post-war modernism style e.g. the so-called Yankee-type or Jengki style were popular in Kebayoran Baru, so called because of its heavy influence from the American post-war modernism. For example, middle-class houses in Kebayoran were designed with a square or rectangular layout, but the first floor is tilted forward to protect the facade of the lower level from the sun. Lower-level official houses in Kebayoran make use of front patio. Larger villas in Kebayoran were usually designed by well-known Indies architects at that time such as Job & Sprey and Liem Bwan Tjie. The current Kebayoran Baru district also includes some villages which is not part of the original plan. These additions are now located in Radio area, Gandaria Utara, and Cipete Utara. Being a design older than 50 years, Kebayoran Baru is considered a cultural heritage (Cagar Budaya) according to Law no. D.IV-6099/d/33/1975. New modern international style developments in the area has been a threat to the historic tropical residential character of Kebayoran Baru. Radio Kebajoran To the southwest of the residential area of Kebayoran was the Radio Kebajoran, a radio broadcasting station located just to the west of Block A. The area of radio broadcasting station has never been fully developed, however the name lingers in the name of the streets Jalan Radio Dalam (inner Radio street) and Jalan Antene (\\"Antennae\\" street). Jalan KH. Ahmad Dahlan was formerly named Jalan Radio (Radio Street), the street that leads to the Radio Kebajoran complex. The entire area planned as Radio Kebajoran complex is now located in Gandaria Utara Administrative Village. Residential district Kebayoran Baru is one of the most affluent areas of Jakarta, where many wealthy citizens reside. Many prominent Indonesians live in the district, including Jusuf Kalla (Vice President of Indonesia and business tycoon), Guruh Sukarnoputra (son of Sukarno and an artist), Hary Tanoesoedibjo (Indonesian media tycoon), and Tomy Winata (businessman and the owner of Artha Graha Bank), among others. Kebayoran Baru, and the district of Menteng, is the most expensive residential districts in Indonesia, having very high land prices per square foot. Although Kebayoran Baru, in the Sukarno era, was solely a residential area, the district now harbors many commercial ventures, is known for its lifestyle businesses. The southern part of the neighborhood is filled with large mansions with lots ranging from 500 square meters to 6000 square meters. The northern part of the city is dominated by luxury apartments and office buildings. Senayan is notable for its large concentration of businesses run by Korean expatriates in Indonesia, a trend which began as early as 1982.

They form a complex which comprises four adjoining synagogues which were built at different periods to accommodate the religious needs of the Sephardic community, each congregation practising a different rite. Today, most of them are in active use. History In 1586, the Ottoman government closed the Ramban Synagogue because it shared a wall with a mosque. As the only other synagogue in Jerusalem at the time belonged to the Karaite minority, followers of mainstream Rabbinic Judaism, including many descendants of refugees from the 1492 expulsion from Spain, held services in private homes for several years until completing the new Yochanan ben Zakai Synagogue nearby. In 1835 Muhammad Ali, viceroy of Egypt who ruled Jerusalem at the time, permitted the refurbishment of the synagogues which had been denied since their construction. At the entrance to the Istanbuli Synagogue is a plaque commemorating the restoration. After the fall of the Jewish Quarter during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War the synagogues were damaged by shell fire. After the Six-Day War the synagogues were restored by architect Dan Tanai. Yochanan ben Zakai Synagogue Installation of the Jerusalem Chacham Bashi at ben Zakai Synagogue (1893) Ben Zakai Synagogue (2006) According to legend, the Yochanan ben Zakai Synagogue (), also known as Kahal Kadosh Gadol, stands on the spot of the Beit Midrash of the tanna Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai, who established the Sanhedrin in Yavneh after the destruction of the Second Temple. The current building was constructed at the beginning of the 17th century. A piece of land below street level was chosen for the synagogue in order to conceal the building from the authorities. Meir Ben Dov, however, is of the opinion that the sub-street level plot wasn‚Äôt intentionally chosen, but rather that the street level itself was lower at the time and the synagogue had protruded above the street. With time the dwellings surrounding the synagogue were demolished and new houses were built above them, while the synagogue itself was preserved. This cycle continued until today, resulting in the synagogue being situated below street level. It should nevertheless be noted that if construction was indeed permitted, the building itself had to comply with Muslim restrictions for dhimmi houses of prayer not to be higher than mosques.Sephardic Synagogues of Old Jerusalem Located in the old Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, it suffered the same fate as most the synagogues in the area during the 19 year Jordanian rule after 1948. It has been fully refurbished since Israel gained control of the Old City during the Six-Day War. This work was initiated by Rabbi Meir Yehuda Getz, Rabbi of the Western Wall, who also restored the Yeshivat haMekubalim to its former glory. Istanbuli Synagogue Istanbuli Synagogue, c. 1825 (steel engraving from John Carne travelogue, publ. 1836) As the Sephardic community of Jerusalem grew, a large group of immigrants arrived from Istanbul, Turkey, who used the adjacent building as a synagogue from 1764. Over time, the Istanbuli Synagogue (), attracted worshipers from the Eastern communities, including Kurdistan and from North and West Africa. The Hekhal dates from the seventeenth century and was imported from a synagogue which had been destroyed in Ancona, Italy. The Teba, constructed in the eighteenth century, came from a synagogue in Pesaro, Italy. The synagogue was renovated in 1836. During the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war the synagogue was occupied by Arabs. After Israel gained control of the Old City during the Six-Day War, it was renovated. As the Istanbuli synagogue is the largest of the four, it is used for the inauguration of the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel. Today, the Istanbuli Synagogue is used by a Spanish and Portuguese congregation following mostly the London rite. Eliahu Ha'navi Synagogue Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue Another synagogue was established in the 16th century and named after Elijah the Prophet. This synagogue is the oldest of the four. The Eliyahu Ha'navi Synagogue mainly served as a beth midrash for Torah study. Also known as Kahal Talmud Torah, it was only used for prayer on festivals. According to legend, the name of the synagogue was given after an event that took place on Yom Kippur, when one person was missing to complete the minyan required for prayer. Out of the blue, a man, unknown to the worshippers, appeared and the service was able to start. The man mysteriously disappeared after the Neilah prayer. The people were sure that the man was none other than Elijah the Prophet. Emtsai Synagogue Emtsai or Middle Synagogue The Emtsai Synagogue or Middle Synagogue (), also known as the Kahal Tzion Synagogue, forms the central chamber of the complex. It was originally a courtyard which was probably used as the women‚Äôs section of the Rabban Yohanan Ben Zakai synagogue. During Sukkot it could be converted into a sukkah for the worshippers. With the growth of the community, it was decided during the middle of the 18th century to roof the yard. It was turned into what is today known as the Middle Synagogue, due to its location in the \\"middle\\" of the other three synagogues.

The right-handed pitcher, a native of Lindsay, Oklahoma, had a 14-year pro career, including 18 games pitched, 16 as a starter, in Major League Baseball for the Boston Red Sox (1944‚Äì1945). Cecil batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed . Cecil's early pro career (1937‚Äì1939; 1941‚Äì1944) was based on the West Coast, especially in the Western International and Pacific Coast leagues. In , during the peak of the World War II manpower shortage, Cecil won 19 of 30 decisions, with a stellar 2.16 earned run average, for the PCL San Diego Padres and was acquired by the Red Sox. Making his Major League debut on August 13, 1944, in relief against the eventual American League champion St. Louis Browns at Fenway Park, Cecil threw four scoreless innings and earned the victory when Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Bobby Doerr hit a walk-off home run in the 13th inning. He then threw successive complete games as a starting pitcher, against the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians, and split two decisions. During his rookie campaign for Boston, Cecil won four games, lost five and compiled a 5.11 earned run average. In , Cecil began the year with the BoSox and was Boston's Opening Day starting pitcher on April 17 against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Cecil lasted 6 innings and allowed eight runs ‚Äî although only two were earned, as he was victimized by three errors by first baseman Catfish Metkovich and made one miscue himself. New York won the game, 8‚Äì4. He started six more games during April and May, but in his seven 1945 starts he lost five, won two, and again compiled a high earned run average, at 5.20. He then was demoted to Boston's top farm team, the Louisville Colonels of the American Association, and spent the rest of his pro career in the minors. In a two- season Major League career, Cecil posted a 6‚Äì10 record with 63 strikeouts and a 5.18 ERA in 106 innings pitched, allowing 118 hits and 60 bases on balls. During his long minor league career, he won 161 games, including 21 games in his final pro season, 1953, in the Class C Arizona‚ÄìTexas League.

Dursteler and Michael W. Homer, Mormons in the Piazza: History of the Latter- day Saints in Italy (Provo and Salt Lake City: Deseret Book and Brigham Young University Religious Studies Center, 2017), p. 199 Barker received his early education in the Weber County (Utah) School District and the University of Utah (B.A., 1901). Barker then served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Swiss‚ÄìAustrian Mission of the LDS Church. After his return from this mission in 1904, he began an extensive study of foreign languages in Europe. He studied at the Sorbonne and the Catholic Institute in Paris. He also studied at the University of Marburg and at universities in Geneva and Neuch√¢tel. In 1907 Barker along with Joseph Evans prepared the second edition of the French language Book of Mormon by dividing the text of the first edition (1852) into chapters and verses and adding cross references to reflect the format of the English version of the Book of Mormon.Rachel Brutsch, \\"Book of Mormon Translation: French\\" in Deseret News Feb. 20, 2012 McClellan, Richard D., Traduit de l'anglais: The First French Book of Mormon Journal of Book of Mormon Studies, Volume 11/Number 1 Article 6, Brigham Young University July 31, 2002 Career In 1906, Barker married Kate Montgomery. After his return to the United States, he was hired as Principal of Weber Academy (now Weber State University) and later as Chair of Brigham Young University's fledgling language department. In 1919, he was appointed head of the University of Utah's Modern Language Department, a position he held for almost three decades. He is the author of the book Apostasy from the Divine Church which is a scholarly account of what he viewed as the decline and fall of the Christian Church not too many years after the times of the early Apostles. His book cites extensively from early historical sources, not all of which are documented because of his death before the publication of the book. The point of view is that of the LDS Church, but it is not an official church publication. The book was published by Barker's wife in 1959, then went out-of-print for a number of years, was re-published in 1985, and is again out-of-print. LDS Church service In 1944, Barker was serving as the president of the Argentine Mission of the LDS Church. In this year he organized the first branch of the church in Uruguay.2008 Deseret Morning News Church Almanac (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Morning News, 2007) p. 496. He continued to serve as president of the Argentine mission until 1944. From 1947-1950 Barker served as the president of the French Mission of the LDS Church. The mission included all of France as well as French-speaking Switzerland and the Walloon region of Belgium. Barker also sent missionaries into Italy to try to contact church members there. In a talk in one of the 1951 General Conferences of the LDS Church Barker expressed a desire for missionaries of the LDS Church to soon share the gospel in Spain, Italy, Greece and other countries of the Mediterranean.Toronto et. al, Mormons in the Piazzza, p. 223 After this David O.

He worked on it from 1943 to 1951. It is cast in a prologue, 4 acts, and an epilogue that repeats the music of the prologue. The opera was recorded in full by the composer in 1966, but it had to wait until April 2011, the centenary of the composer's birth, for a complete theatrical performance (there was an abridged stage production in 1982 and a concert version in 2010). The libretto was by Herrmann's first wife, Lucille Fletcher, based on the first part of Emily Bront√´'s 1847 novel of the same name. Fletcher also interpolated some text from the second part of the novel, and from some unrelated poems by Emily Bront√´ (such as \\"I have been wandering through the Green Woods\\"). By the time the work was finished, Fletcher and Herrmann had divorced and he had married her cousin Lucy. Although the work is largely unknown, Lucille Fletcher said it was \\"perhaps the closest to his talent and heart\\". Genesis Herrmann started work on the opera in April 1943,Bernard Herrmann Society while composing the film score for Jane Eyre (an adaptation of Jane Eyre by Emily Bront√´'s sister Charlotte Bront√´). It received a boost in 1946, when Herrmann and Fletcher made a visit to the moor country near Manchester, while he was fulfilling conducting engagements with the Hall√© Orchestra. There, they visited the Bront√´ home at Haworth. He completed the composition in Minneapolis. On the score, Herrmann wrote that he finished the work at 3:45 pm on 30 June 1951. Performances Wuthering Heights was never staged in Herrmann's lifetime, despite a number of attempts on his part. One of the few opportunities to mount a staged production during Herrmann's lifetime was one offered by Julius Rudel, but either because Rudel insisted on cuts and a different, up-beat ending, which the composer refused to permit, or because of scheduling challengessources differ on the detailsthe production did not eventuate. It had earlier been under consideration by Sir John Barbirolli, conductor of the Hall√© Orchestra, but a perusal of the enormous score caused him to reconsider. It was also briefly considered by the San Francisco Opera, as a project for Leopold Stokowski to conduct, but he was unavailable so the idea was dropped. In 1957, the Heidelberg Opera considered staging it, and Herrmann was convinced it was going ahead, even believing that the contracts had been signed for an April 1958 performance ‚Äì but it too was dropped.Music Web International Its official world stage premiere was on 6 November 1982, almost seven years after Herrmann's death, by the Portland Opera in Portland, Oregon. However, that performance omitted 30 to 40 minutes of the music, and the ending was changed to the one Julius Rudel had proposed many years earlier. Orson Welles was asked to direct the production, but declined. The cast included mezzo-soprano Geraldine Decker as Nelly Dean. The production was to have been videotaped for later broadcast on PBS, but this was not done due to the high cost of videotape. Most reviews of the performance were unenthusiastic. A concert version under the title Les Hauts de Hurlevent was presented on 14 July 2010 at the Radio France and Montpellier Languedoc- Rousillon Festival, conducted by Alain Altinoglu. In April 2011, to mark the centenary of Bernard Herrmann's birth, Wuthering Heights was finally presented in full for the first time, by Minnesota Opera under Michael Christie.

She was named after the 17th century statesman Cardinal de Richelieu. The ship was the flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron for most of her career. Richelieu caught on fire in Toulon in 1880 and was scuttled to prevent her magazines from exploding. She was salvaged and, after being repaired, resumed her role as flagship. In 1886, however, the ship was placed in reserve and was eventually condemned in 1901. While being towed to the ship breakers in Amsterdam in 1911, Richelieu was caught in a storm in the Bay of Biscay and had to be cast loose from her tugboat. Nevertheless, the ship survived the storm and was recovered near the Scilly Isles from where she was towed to her final destination. Design and description Richelieu was designed by Henri Dupuy de L√¥me as an improved version of the s. As a central battery ironclad she had her armament concentrated amidships. Like most ironclads of her era she was equipped with a plough-shaped ram that projected from her hull.Gardiner, p. 288 Her crew numbered around 750 officers and men. The metacentric height of the ship was very low, a little above . The ship measured overall, with a beam of . Richelieu had a maximum draft of Silverstone, p. 65 and displaced . Propulsion Richelieu was given two propellers by Henri Dupuy de L√¥me to make her more maneuverable for ramming. She had two Indret 3-cylinder horizontal return connecting rod compound steam engines, each driving a single propeller. Her engines were powered by eight oval boilers. On sea trials the engines produced and Richelieu reached .de Balincourt and Vincent-Br√©chignac, p. 28 She carried of coal which allowed her to steam for approximately at a speed of . Richelieu was initially square rigged with three masts, then cut down to a schooner rig. Armament Richelieus intermediate armament of four guns was mounted in barbettes on the upper deck, one gun at each corner of the battery, with her six guns on the battery deck below the barbettes. One 240-millimeter gun was mounted in the forecastle as a chase gun. The ship's secondary armament consisted of ten guns. These were later replaced by six guns. The 18-caliber 274-millimeter Mod√©le 1870 gun fired an armor-piercing, shell while the gun itself weighed . The gun fired its shell at a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at the muzzle. The armor-piercing shell of the 19-caliber 240-millmeter Modele 1870 gun weighed while the gun itself weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armor at the muzzle. The 138-millimeter gun was 21 calibers long and weighed . It fired a explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells.Brassey, p. 477 At some point the ship received eight, and then later ten more, Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns. They fired a shell weighing about at a muzzle velocity of about to a range of about . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute. The hull was not recessed to enable any of the guns on the battery deck to fire forward or aft. However, the guns mounted in the barbettes sponsoned out over the sides of the hull did have some ability to fire fore and aft. Late in the ship's career four above-water torpedo tubes were added. Armor Richelieu had a complete wrought iron waterline belt. The sides and the transverse bulkheads of the battery itself were armored with of wrought iron. The barbettes were unarmored, but the deck was protected by of armor. Service Richelieu was laid down at Toulon in 1869 and launched on 3 December 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known, it was probably due to financial pressures caused by slashing of French Navy's budget which was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71 coupled with the outdated work practices of the French dockyards at the time, which were not suitable for the Industrial Age.Ropp, pp. 31, 55‚Äì58 The ship began her sea trials on 12 April 1875, but did not begin her service with the Mediterranean Squadron, of which she became flagship, until 10 February 1876. She was placed in reserve on 3 December 1879. While in Toulon harbor on 29 December 1880, Richelieu caught fire and had to be scuttled to prevent her magazines from exploding. The ship capsized to port in of water; she lay on her barbettes almost at a 90¬∞ angle. In order to salvage her, all accessible guns, ammunition, masts, armor and movable decks were removed and the equivalent weight was placed in the ship's holds to lower her center of gravity. A sheer hulk was moved to her port side and cables were connected to on the other side of Richelieu. 360 empty casks and of cork were attached to the starboard side to prevent the ship from rolling too far the other way. After an hour and a half of lifting, Richelieu had been righted to a 45¬∞ angle; a subsequent effort completed the job. Richelieu was repaired and returned to service as the flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron on 8 October 1881 where she remained until 1886. The squadron made port visits in Tangiers and Lisbon in 1884 before sailing to Brest and Cherbourg for exercises.Saibene, pp. 11‚Äì12 In 1885 Richelieu tested Bullivant torpedo nets, but they reduced her speed to a maximum of and as a result were not considered successful. The ship was placed back in reserve in 1886 and became flagship of the Reserve Squadron on 8 September 1892, which, despite its name, consisted of ships in commission. The squadron conducted exercises from June to August 1892 in French waters.Saibene, p. 17 Richelieu was condemned on 5 March 1900, but was not immediately sold. After having been sold to Dutch ship breakers, Richelieu departed Toulon on 28 January 1911. She was under tow in the Bay of Biscay, having left the Mediterranean for the first time in her existence, when a storm caused the tugboat to cast her loose. The ship remained afloat, however, and was subsequently recovered near the Scilly Isles and towed to Amsterdam where she was broken up.

In January 2007, WNRJ's playlist began to shift towards Rhythmic Contemporary by incorporating more current R&B;/Hip-Hop product into the mix and lessening on Dance and Old School tracks as a way to boost ratings and because of WWHV's flip from Urban to Sports (now WXTG). During this time, the station was still suffering from dismal numbers in the Arbitron ratings.

Redfield was a great-grandson of William Charles Redfield, one of the founders and the first president of AAAS.  Solution to MacMahon's conjecture  Redfield's ability is evident in letters exchanged among Redfield, Percy MacMahon, and Sir Thomas Muir, following the publication of Redfield's paper [1] in 1927. Apparently Redfield sent a copy of his paper to MacMahon. In reply (letter of November 19, 1927), MacMahon expresses the view that Redfield has made a valuable contribution to the subject and goes on to mention a conjecture which he himself made in his recently delivered Rouse-Ball memorial lecture. He also says that it is probable that Redfield's work would lead to a proof of it. Such was the case: in a draft reply dated December 26, 1927, Redfield writes: : \\"I am now able to demonstrate your conjectured expression...\\". MacMahon, who had failed to prove it himself and then put the matter before men at both Cambridge and Oxford \\"without effect\\", delightedly wrote to Redfield (letter of January 9, 1928): : \\"when you first wrote to me I formed the opinion that with your powerful handling of the theory of substitutions it would be childs play to you and I was right. I congratulate you and feel sure that your methods will carry you far.\\" MacMahon urged Redfield to publish his new results and also informed Muir about them. In a letter to Redfield dated December 31, 1931, Muir also encourages him to publish his verification \\"without waiting for MacMahon's executors\\" and suggests the Journal of the London Mathematical Society as an appropriate medium. As far as is known, Redfield did not follow up this suggestion, but the proof of MacMahon's conjecture was included in an unpublished manuscript which appears to be a sequel to the paper [3].  Redfield's contemporaries on him  A letter from Professor Cletus Oakley to Frank Harary, dated December 19, 1963, reads in part: : \\"Howard Redfield was a graduate of Haverford College in the Class of 1899. He was a man of very broad interests and we do not have a continuous record of his doings. Directly after leaving college, he worked as a civil engineer. In college he took a lot of languages and mathematics. (There was no major department in those days.) After graduating from Haverford with a B.S. degree, he took a S.B. degree in M.I.T. and a M.A. and Ph.D. (mathematics) at Harvard. During the year 1907-1908, he studied romance philology at the University of Paris. In 1908-1909, he was an instructor in mathematics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1910-1911 he taught French at Swarthmore College and from 1912-1914 he was an assistant professor of romance languages at Princeton University. From 1916 onward until his death in 1944, he was a practicing civil engineer in Wayne, Pennsylvania. \\" : \\"I knew him from about 1938-1944. Indeed in 1940 he came to Haverford College and gave us some lectures on 'Electronic Digital Computers' (this was slightly before Eckert-Mauchly). Knowing him as I did in those later years, I could well understand how he would not make a great teacher. He was completely off in the clouds at all times. He never looked at you, he spoke softly with his eyes on the floor, he worked with his back to you and wrote on the board. His board work, however, was impeccable. It could have been photographed and printed by photo offset it was so perfect.\\" : \\"He came to Haverford to talk to our math club many times and always had something new to say...\\" Redfield's brother, Alfred, a marine biologist-oceanographer and former Associate Director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, wrote (letter to E. Keith Lloyd, September 8, 1976): : \\"During the later years of his life, he turned to mathematics and I usually found him working at it when I called on him. It was evident that this was his true love.\\"  Publications  # # # #: This publication is based on a manuscript discovered in Redfield's legacy by his daughter. The correspondence found with the manuscript revealed that it had been submitted for publication in the American Journal of Mathematics on October 19, 1940 and was rejected by the editors in a brief letter of January 7, 1941. Redfield answered the objections of the referee in great detail ten days later and asked specific questions, but he never received a reply to his rebuttal. Apparently it was not subsequently resubmitted elsewhere. The significance of this paper is discussed in. # #: This publication represents a typescript of a lecture delivered by Redfield in 1937.

He obtained his education at the University of Santo Tom√°s in Costa Rica and the Universidad de San Carlos in Guatemala, where he obtained a degree in law. Orphaned at a young age, he was brought up by his uncle Juan Rafael Mora Porras, the president of Costa Rica between 1849 and 1859, and his historical novel La trinchera recounts Mora Porras' campaign against William Walker's forces in Nicaragua in 1856. After Mora Porras was deposed, he followed his uncle into exile in Europe in 1859. He returned in 1860 during Mora Porras' attempt to regain power, and was spared from the firing squad which executed the former president.

Mean annual precipitation in Azerbaijan (mm). The climate of Azerbaijan is very diverse. Nine out of eleven existing climate zones are present in Azerbaijan. Geography Azerbaijan is situated on the northern extremity of the subtropical zone, in the southeastern part of the Caucasus and the northwestern part of the Iranian plateau. The complicated geographical location and landscape, the proximity of the Caspian Sea, the effect of the sun's radiation, air masses of different origin, etc., contribute to its climatological diversity. State Land and Cartography Committee.. Landscape As a predominantly mountainous country, Azerbaijan is surrounded by the Greater Caucasus, Lesser Caucasus, Talysh and North Iranian Mountains. The Kur-Araz Lowland, between the Greater and Lesser Caucasus, stretches to the Caspian Sea in the eastern part of the country. The Greater Caucasus, situated in the north of the country and stretching from the northwest to the southeast, protects the country from direct influences of northern cold air masses. That leads to the formation of a subtropical climate on most of the foothills and plains of the country. Other mountain chains surrounding the country also impact air circulation. The complexity of the landscape causes nonuniform formation of climatic zones and creates vertical climate zones. Solar radiation Sunsets in Azerbaijan are often very colorful. The Azerbaijani plains and foothills have high insolation rates. The sun shines for 2,200 to 2,400 hours annually on the Kur- Araz lowland, Apsheron peninsula and other plains and foothills, and 2,600 to 2,800 hours on the plains around the Araz river in the Nakhchivan region. Due to increased cloudiness in the mountainous regions, those areas receive only 1,900 to 2,200 hours of direct sunlight. Bright sun shines 2,200 to 2,500 hours a year at altitudes over . The total annual radiation equals 128‚Äì132 kcal/cm2 (118‚Äì122 kWh/ft2). Toward the mountains, it declines to 120‚Äì124 kcal/cm2 (109‚Äì113 kWh/ft2), at an altitude of above sea level, then gradually increases and reaches 140‚Äì150 kcal/cm2 (129‚Äì139 kWh/ft2) at altitudes above in the Greater and Lesser Caucasus. The total amount of solar radiation affecting the Araz plains in Nakhchivan totals 148‚Äì150 kcal/cm2 (137‚Äì139 kWh/ft2). It increases in the mountains, reaching 152‚Äì160 kcal/cm2 (140‚Äì148 kWh/ft2). The solar radiation on the country's plains and foothills amounts to 40‚Äì50 kcal/cm2 (37‚Äì46 kWh/ft2); in Lenkoran, 50‚Äì60 kcal/cm2 (46‚Äì55 kWh/ft2); in the mountains, 15‚Äì25 kcal/cm2 (14‚Äì23 kWh/ft2). Circulation of air masses Climate formation in Azerbaijan is influenced by various air masses. Cold air masses, such as the Kara and Scandinavian arctic anticyclones, the temperate Siberian anticyclones, and the maritime Azores maximum influence the climate. Likewise, tropical hot air masses (subtropical anticyclone and southern cyclones), as well as Central Asian anticyclones and local weather conditions, have influence. These air masses enter the country in different ways thanks to its varied geography. Thus, although they do not prevent the hot masses entering Azerbaijan from the south, cold continental and maritime air masses cause changes in properties of those hot air masses, and influence the dynamics of the atmosphere . Major aspects Some of the major influences on Azerbaijan's climate are temperature, precipitation, humidity, rate of evaporation, and cloud cover. Temperature Mean annual temperature in Azerbaijan (¬∞C). The temperature regime and its distribution throughout Azerbaijan is regular, and depends on the features of air masses entering the country, the regional landscape, and proximity to the Caspian Sea. The sea causes temperatures in the maritime areas ( away from the sea) to decline in the summer and rise in the winter. At the same time, the sea moderates the influence of hot and dry air masses coming from Central Asia. The average annual temperature is in the Kur-Araz Lowland, the coastal regions south to the Apsheron Peninsula, and in the Lenkoran Lowland. The temperature declines with proximity to the mountains, averaging at an altitude of , and at . Both the absolute minimum temperature () and the absolute maximum temperature () were observed in Julfa and Ordubad. Precipitation The maximum annual precipitation falls in Lankaran () and the minimum in the Absheron Peninsula (). Climate types Winter in the Shamakhi District. Taking into consideration the distribution and features of the weather, temperature, humidity, and precipitation, nine out of the 11 climate patterns in the K√∂ppen climate classification can be found in Azerbaijan. Many of these patterns are divided into subtypes. * Semi-desert and dry steppe climates cover the central lowlands in the Kur to , the Caspian zone from the end of Samur River to the Gizilagaj gulf, the plains of Nakhchivan along the Araz river, and the valleys of the Talish Mountains below . Annual precipitation accounts for 15 to 50 percent of the possible evaporation. Winters are usually cool (though cold on the Araz River plains along, and in the valleys of, the Talish Mountains). Summers can become very hot, sometimes over . * Semi-desert and dry steppe climate with cold winter and dry hot climate. * A moderate climate with mild, dry winters covers the south hills (below ) of the Greater Caucasus, the Ganikh-Eyrichay valley between , and the north and east hills of the Lesser Caucasus between . Annual precipitation accounts for 50 to 100 percent of the possible evaporation in this climate zone. * A moderately warm climate with dry summers covers the Lankaran-Astara region. Annual precipitation accounts for 100 to 150 percent or more of the possible evaporation. Winters are cool, summers are hot and dry, and autumns are rainy. The period of May through August is usually dry, requiring artificial irrigation. * Cold, dry winters cover the southeast hills of the Greater Caucasus between , and mountainous regions of the Lesser Caucasus between . Annual precipitation accounts for 75 to 100 percent of the possible evaporation. Summers are cool and winter is mild. * A cold climate with cool, dry summers covers the middle and high mountains of Nakhchivan AR between . Annual precipitation accounts for 50 to 100 percent of possible evaporation. Summers are cool, and winter is cold enough for snow. * A moderate climate with equal distribution of rainfall covers the mountainous forests in the south between , and the northeast hills of the Greater Caucasus between . Annual rainfall accounts for 75 to 100 percent of the possible evaporation in the south hills, and 50 to 100 percent in the northeast hills. Winters are cool, summers warm. * A cold climate with heavy precipitation year-round occurs in the south hills of the Greater Caucasus between , which include forest, subalpine, and alpine zones. Annual precipitation accounts for more than 150 to 200 percent of the possible evaporation. Winters are cold, summers cool. * Alpine tundra covers the areas of the Greater and Lesser Caucasus above , and Nakhchivan above . Annual precipitation accounts for more than 100 to 200 percent of the possible evaporation. Winters and summers are both cold. In some places, the snow does not melt until the following winter.

The Camac proceeds through Kilmatead, where there is a small lake with islands, and from there flows into Corkagh Park (formerly Corkagh demesne) where the river was diverted into numerous ponds over the centuries that provided water for local mills. There are two ponds at the back of Kilmateed, a new fishery pond in Corkagh Park, the dry bed of a pond at the back of the Fairview Oil Mill ruins (near Cherrywood), and further downstream next to Moyle Park College, where the water was used by Clondalkin Paper Mills in the past. Many of the concrete ponds are now in poor condition as water levels have dropped and the ponds have silted up. The mill pond serving Leinster Paper Mills was situated on the old Nangor Road, but was covered to make way for a car park and entrance for the Mill Shopping Centre from the Nangor Road side. The Camac then flows through Clondalkin village opposite the Garda Station and down Watery Lane, flowing on towards Nangor Road, and meeting tributaries in the industrial Bluebell and Robinhood Estate areas. It then travels through the Lansdowne Valley to residential Drimnagh and Crumlin. The river goes on to Inchicore, where it is tunnelled under the Grand Canal before a bridge crossing at Golden Bridge. It runs behind Richmond Park, home to St Patrick's Athletic and gives its name to the ground's 'Camac Terrace', and comes to Kilmainham, where it runs behind the jail museum, before entering the Liffey alongside Heuston Station, a little upstream of Sean Heuston Bridge.Doyle (2013), p.38 The river was culverted underneath the railway station when it was built in 1846. Tributaries The Camac receives tributaries in the Slade of Saggart, including the Ferny Glinn and the Two Slades, and later from around Newcastle, and near Clondalkin (including the Boherboy, Brownsbarn and Fettercairn Streams, the latter joining near the boundary of Corkagh Park, in which the Camac features).

Lakers' victory riot The 1999‚Äì2000 NBA season ended up being fortuitous for the Los Angeles Lakers, who were in their inaugural year playing out of the Staples Center. On the night of June 19, 2000, the Lakers beat the visiting Indiana Pacers, winning their first championship in twelve years. While the game took place inside the arena, it was broadcast for free outside on a large video screen. Thousands had gathered to watch the game on the screen and be in the proximity of the arena. As soon as the game ended, the crowd of nearly 10,000 people quickly turned violent as violent opportunists began attacking property, making bonfires, beating up a Lincoln limo and two LAPD cars, flipping a news van, and setting fire to a Ford Explorer, as well as looting local businesses. All the local media channels covered the riots live on television, where LAPD officers were seen containing the rioters, but taking some time before actively dispersing the crowd. The LAPD was roundly criticized for not taking a harder approach to the rioters. Part of what influenced the LAPD's hands-off approach was the recent Rampart Scandal that had rocked the department and generated much criticism in the news. Nationally embarrassed by its handling of the Lakers' victory riot, the city and the LAPD revised its plan for the 2000 Democratic National Convention to take place less than two months later.  Birth of the Independent Media Center  The 2000 DNC brought about the birth of the Los Angeles media center for Independent Media Center (IMC) (also known as Indymedia.org). It became the fastest independent media collective to go from inspiration, after the police brutality on Protesters and Indie journalists at the November 1999 World Trade Organization WTO summit in Seattle, to having live satellite transmission capabilities and a bona-fide, official entity. A multiethnic technical group composed of indie Hollywood filmmakers, MAPA members worked for several months in the technical planning and deployment of a media center. Indymedia leased the Patriotic Hall, converting the entire building to a giant media studio within 24 hours of taking possession of the premises on August 12. It was outfitted with film production equipment like diesel power generators, power distribution networks, and stage lighting within a few months. The entire lobby became a public forum with several podiums and large-screen televisions while technical and production crews managed the live media in several upper floors. Dozens of field reporters delivered media to a triage stage and moved on to editing crews composed of teenage nerds to Hollywood indie filmmakers. Political and media luminaries were present including Amy Goodman, broadcasting her daily radio show Democracy Now!. This event marked also the Beginning of TV/satellite broadcast of Democracy Now! utilizing the Indymedia Studio‚Äîand other social activists like Arianna Huffington, Gore Vidal, Christopher Hitchens, and several political candidates including Peter Camejo, Kucinich, as well as pundits, and activists. This independent media content was broadcast through DishNetwork and DirectTV via Freespeech TV available on both Satellite Television providers. On Monday Aug 14, The LAPD, aided by the Calif Highway patrol. (State Police) were sent to shut down the studio.CorpWatch : DNC: Corporate Sponsors and Rubber Bullets However, there were no laws in violation, and Indymedia.org had a valid lease from the County. The LAPD released the building to the tenants. The following day, IMC resumed media broadcast activities, due to the quick intervention of the National Lawyers Guild which oversaw the entire DNC activities in order to provide eye-witness accounts to ensure the prevention of police abuse and to ensure a democratic process. National Lawyers Guild members identified themselves with bright green, fluorescent, ball-caps emblazoned with their name and carrying legal pads. Progressive supporters like Ben and Jerry ice cream,(a sister company of Breyers) provided thousands of dollars in free product to the Indymedia project with a continuously-resupplied truck in the Patriotic Hall parking lot. This event became known as the DNC-2000 \\"Shadow Convention\\". Anarchists' activities In addition to the anarchist participation in the protests of the DNC, a group of anarchists, calling themselves the \\"August Collective\\", held the North American Anarchist Conference, a three-day conference in the days before the DNC took place. The conference was a convergence of hundreds of anarchists both from North America and abroad, and consisted of workshops, panels, speaking engagements and various other events. The recommended $25 donation granted access to the events for three days, as well as free housing (attendees slept on the floor in the warehouse that hosted the conference) and free meals provided by Food Not Bombs. Due to the local media and LAPD-induced \\"Black Scare\\", the organizers of the event took special security measures during preparations. For instance, attendees of the conference had to \\"check-in\\" at a local vegetarian cafe called Luna Tierra Sol to get the address of the conference warehouse (a large orange building next to LA River that usually held \\"Raves\\"). The motive behind this decision was fear that if the LAPD knew the location of the conference, they would pressure the owner to cancel the rental of the building, a common scenario for modern radical organizers. In addition to this, the actual location of the building was withheld from everyone except the two August Collective members who secured the space. Despite this, the LAPD reportedly installed a video surveillance system on a nearby lamppost days before the conference, and removed it after the DNC had ended. This leak in security is generally believed to have been through law enforcement surveillance, such as wire taps. Despite fear that the LAPD would raid the conference and shut it down, the conference went ahead as scheduled, and other than undercover surveillance, police presence was kept to a minimum. Among other things, many members and attendees suspected that the police would pressure the fire department to deem the nature of sleeping attendees as a fire hazard. However, nothing came of such suspicions. The Protest Zone In order to provide security around the Staples Center, Los Angeles Convention Center (which housed print and radio media), and the large media contingent housed outside in a \\"Media Village\\", the LAPD, Los Angeles Fire Department and United States Secret Service designed a large secure zone surrounded by a perimeter fence consisting of K-rail barriers with a 10-foot fence rising up from it. The parking lots adjacent to the Staples Center were designated for the large Media Village (consisting of many trailers and media vehicles for the television press), transportation department vehicles, security checkpoints, as well as \\"VIP Vehicles\\" to be parked immediately in front of the Staples Center. As a result of this layout, the perimeter fence remained a city block away from the Staples Center, and placed the proposed space for the expected protestors (known as the \\"Protest Zone\\") a substantial distance from the event they were protesting. The proposed layout was diagramed and published by the Los Angeles Times. Upon viewing the proposed layout, the protestors legally challenged the proposed fence route, winning a court judgement in their favor. As a result, the area for the VIP parking lot was moved elsewhere and the perimeter fence was redrawn to create a rectangular protest zone that stopped only a dozen yards short of the Staples Center entrance. This left only one open side of the protest zone for entrance and exit. The protestors also won permission to set up a stage in the Protest Zone with sound amplification; and time on the stage was divided into hour-long segments and divided among the many groups wishing to bring up issues outside the convention. The LAPD was given permission take the stage and order the Protest Zone cleared if a civil disturbance was imminent. Rage Against the Machine concert In the months leading up to the convention, cable channel MTV began planning a large, free concert to take place in downtown Los Angeles as a part of its \\"Choose or Lose\\" campaign aimed at getting youth out to vote. MTV decided that popular rock group Rage Against the Machine would be the ideal marquee band. However, the band's political message, combined with the title of its most recent album, The Battle of Los Angeles, caused serious concerns from LA city leaders. MTV's applications for staging the concert were denied by the city and the channel eventually gave up its attempts to plan one. After MTV's attempts failed, a number of protest groups agreed to give their one-hour time allotments on the stage in the Protest Zone. The band was offered prime time slots coinciding with the marquee speaker on the opening night of the convention, then-President Bill Clinton. Although they were at first required by the City of Los Angeles to perform in a small venue at a considerable distance, early in August a United States district court judge ruled that the City's request was too restrictive and the City subsequently allowed the protests and concert to be held at a site across from the DNC. The police response was to increase security measures, which included a 12' fence and patrolling by a minimum of 2,000 officers wearing riot gear, as well as additional horses, motorcycles, squad cars and police helicopters. A police spokesperson said they were \\"gravely concerned because of security reasons\\". During the concert, the band's frontman Zach de la Rocha said to the crowd, \\"brothers and sisters, our democracy has been hijacked,\\" and later also shouted \\"we have a right to oppose these motherfuckers!\\" After the performance, a small group of attendees congregated at the point in the protest area closest to the DNC, facing the police officers. Reports of what activity they engaged in vary, the most extreme being reports of throwing glass, concrete and water bottles filled with \\"noxious agents,\\" spraying ammonia on police and slingshotting rocks and steel balls. However, milder reports also arose, one only mentioning \\"tossing rocks.\\" The police soon after declared the gathering an unlawful assembly, switch off the electrical supply, interrupting performing band Ozomatli, and informed the protestors that they had 15 minutes to disperse on pain of arrest. Some of the protesters remained, however, including two young men who climbed the fence and waved black flags, who were subsequently shot in the face with pepper spray. Police then forcibly dispersed the crowd, using tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets. At least six people were arrested in the incident. The police faced severe and broad criticism for their reaction, with an American Civil Liberties Union spokesperson saying that it was \\"nothing less than an orchestrated police riot.\\" Several primary witnesses reported unnecessarily violent actions and police abuses, including firing on reporters, lawyers and people obeying police commands. Protesters were trapped between police fronts and some were beaten by police while trying to obey commands. At one point, four young men were repeatedly beaten by mounted police while trapped against a wall. Police responded that their response was \\"outstanding\\" and \\"clearly disciplined.\\" Footage of the protest and ensuing violence, along with an MTV News report on the incident, was included in the Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium DVD.

An improved version of the Saab Safari, the MFI-17 is manufactured in Kamra, Pakistan by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC). As of 2006, 80 aircraft had been manufactured. Built to Mil-Spec and fully aerobatic, it is used for training, towing and other ground support roles. An upgraded version, the PAC Super Mushshak, has also been produced by PAC. Development Dubai Airshow, 2017 PAC Super Mushshak cockpit at Dubai Airshow, 2017 Origins  The MFI-15 Safari and MFI-17 Supporter were created from Saab's adaptation of the MFI-9 Junior for basic training for civil and military operators. In 1968 Saab began work on its MFI-15, based on the MFI-9 but with some design changes. Foremost of the changes in the Saab built MFI-15 prototype was the 120 kW (160shp) Lycoming IO-320 piston engine. Like the MFI-9, the MFI-15 retained the unusual braced, mid-mounted and slightly forward-swept wing and rearward-hinged canopy, offering good all- around vision. The prototype made its maiden flight on June 11, 1969. Follow- up testing of the MFI-15 resulted in a more powerful IO-360 engine, while the horizontal tail was relocated to prevent it being damaged by thrown up debris. The first flight of this modified form was in February 1971. Sold as the MFI-15 Safari, most went to civil customers, however Sierra Leone and Norway took delivery of Safaris for military pilot training. To improve the Safari's military market appeal, Saab developed the MFI-17 Supporter, fitted with six underwing hardpoints for light and practice weaponry, giving it weapons training and light COIN capabilities. First flight was on July 6, 1972. Important were Denmark and Zambia. Production ended in the late 1970s after about 250 Safaris and Supporters had been built, mostly for civil customers. Pakistan has taken delivery of 18 Supporters, while 92 have been assembled locally by PAC from knocked down kits and a further 149 were built locally by PAC. It is named Mushshak (\\"Proficient\\") in Pakistani service. In 1981, Pakistan acquired sole manufacturing rights of the Supporter. The development of the MFI-395 in 1995 initiated by the then-managing director of AMF, Air Cdr Muhammad Younas. The aircraft was built by upgrading the MFI-17 with an advanced 260 hp engine, electrical instruments, dual flight control systems and a Bendix RSA fuel injection system. Design Fitted with an American 260 hp engine, cockpit air conditioning, electrical instruments, and electric/manual elevator and rudder trim, the aircraft has been developed to meet FAR part 23 certification in normal, utility and aerobatics categories. It has a spacious side-by-side cockpit allowing good contact between the pilot and the co-pilot/observer or between the student and the instructor. Variants Pakistan Aeronautical Complex unveiled a light attack variant of the Super Mushshak in March 2019. The aircraft is capable of launching Barq laser-guided and anti-tank missiles.

The species is popular amongst aquarium hobbyists, and is most commonly sold under the name kribensis, although the species has other common names, including various derivatives and color morphs of the kribensis: krib, common krib, red krib, super-red krib and rainbow krib, along with rainbow cichlid and purple cichlid.  Description  The pair, more colorful female in the front In the wild, male P. pulcher grow to a maximum length of approximately and a maximum weight of . Females are smaller and deeper bodied, growing to a maximum length of and a maximum weight of . Both sexes have a dark longitudinal stripe that runs from the caudal fin to the mouth and pink to red abdomens, the intensity of which changes during courtship and breeding. The dorsal and caudal fins also may bear gold-ringed eye spots or ocelli. Males show colour polymorphisms in some populations collected at single localities. Juveniles are monomorphic until approximately six months of age. Distribution, habitat and predators Pelvicachromis pulcher is native to southern Nigeria and to coastal areas of Cameroon, where it occurs in warm (), acidic to neutral (pH 5.6‚Äì6.2), soft water (12‚Äì22 mg L‚àí1 CaCO3). Populations of P. pulcher also occur outside its natural range in Hawaii, USA as a by- product of the ornamental fish trade. The species inhabits both slow and fast- moving water, though it is only found where patches of dense vegetation are available. Other fish that share the habitat of P. pulcher include other Pelvicachromis species (Pelvicachromis taeniatus), other cichlid species (Chromidotilapia guntheri, Hemichromis cristatus and H. fasciatus, Tilapia mariae and T. zilli) along with Brycinus longipinnis and Aphyosemion species. The species is prey for a number of rheophilic predators including Hepsetus odoe, Hydrocynus forskahlii, and Lates niloticus (Nile perch). In the natural habitat, P. pulcher have been observed excavating, defending, and sheltering in caves dug underneath plants, and these holes are also used for breeding. Not all P. pulcher, however, claim territories and many live in large, non- reproductive aggregates. Diet Despite the suggestion in some aquarium literature that the species feeds on worms, crustaceans, and insects, analysis of the stomach contents of wild P. pulcher suggests this is incorrect. A study by Nwadiaro (1985) of 161 individuals showed that the main food items were diatoms, green algae, pieces of higher plants, along with blue-green algae. Invertebrates, though consumed, were found to be relatively uncommon food items for wild fish. Sexual dimorphism and reproduction Larval P. pulcher Like other Pelvicachromis species, P. pulcher is sexually dimorphic. Males have pointed pelvic, dorsal, and anal fins, while the female's pelvic, dorsal, and anal fins are more rounded in appearance. In addition, males are larger, lack the gold sheen to the dorsal fin and have a more elongated, spade-shaped caudal fin. Despite the suggestion in the aquarium literature that the species forms monogamous pairs, the formation of polygynous harems is not uncommon in the natural habitat. The species are secretive cave spawners (speleophils) although detailed information on their reproductive biology in the wild is limited. In the wild, the species is known to breed in holes excavated beneath aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. In captivity, artificial caves are readily accepted as breeding sites, however, these too are excavated prior to egg- laying. The eggs are adhesive and are frequently laid in rows of ca. 10 on the upper surface of the cave and produce a clutch that ranges in size from 40 to 100. Both the male and female provide active brood care, typically lasting 21‚Äì28 days, which includes guarding, herding, and feeding. It is noteworthy, however, that the female is predominantly responsible for fry care, while the male is primarily involved in territorial defence. As in all Pelvicachromis species, the gender ratio of female to male fry increases with pH. This ratio is also known to vary at different locales in the wild. Breeding pairs of P. pulcher have been known to adopt similarly aged fry from conspecifics in aquarium trials, and it has been suggested this may be an adaption to reduce predation on their own fry. Male colour polymorphism may be indicative of behavioural differences. For example, red males obtained from a single site were found to be more aggressive and more polygamous than yellow males obtained from the same site. In addition, the species has been demonstrated to engage in cooperative territorial defence where multiple males defend a single territory. Taxonomy Pelvicachromis pulcher was originally described as Pelmatochromis pulcher by George Boulenger in 1901. Subsequently, a number of junior synonyms (Pelmatochromis aureocephalus, Pelmatochromis camerunensis) and misidentifications (Pelmatochromis kribensis, Pelmatochromis subocellatus var. kribensis and Pelmatochromis pulcher var. kribensis) were brought into use. Some of these synonyms are still in use by aquarium hobbyists which complicates identification of this species. Many of the common and trade names used for this species, such as kribensis, krib, rainbow krib are derived from the erroneous binomial, Pelmatochromis kribensis. The genus Pelmatochromis was revised by Thys van den Audenaerde in 1968 when the genus Pelvicachromis was erected with P. pulcher designated as the type species. The etymology of this species is as follows: * Pelvicachromis: Latin, pelvica = pelvic or belly + Greek, chromis = a fish, perhaps a perch * Pulcher: Latin, pretty or beautiful In the aquarium A female P. pulcher displaying her full, vivid breeding colouration. Note the dark black around the magenta-coloured stomach Pelvicachromis pulcher is a popular cichlid for the aquarium.  Selective breeding  An albino form of the species has been developed for the aquarium trade. Unlike normal albinism, the trait is not recessively inherited in P. pulcher. The trait is incompletely dominant. Like many albino animals red and yellow pigments are retained, however, albino P. pulcher also show patches of melanin in the dorsal and caudal fin around the ocelli. Langhammer (1982) reports that matings from these albino forms with red and yellow pigments produce 25% wild coloured offspring and 75% albino fry. The albino fry were themselves divided into completely amelanistic forms, and forms which retained colouration of their parents.

This subdistrict is home to SMA Negeri 8 Jakarta Tebet is prone to flooding, especially the area around the Ciliwung River. History Before urban development, the area that is now Tebet were marshy land dotted with fish ponds and criss-crossing canals. The river Ciliwung present in the east side of the Subdistrict. The name Tebet itself was derived from tebat, Indonesian for \\"fish pond\\". Up until the early 1960s many fish ponds can still be found in Tebet. In preparation for GANEFO and the 1962 Asian Games, the population residing in Senayan had to be relocated because of the compulsory land acquisition to build the Gelora Bung Karno sporting complex. Hence the planning of Tebet was started very early in the 1960s to house the displaced people of Senayan. The administrative villages of Tebet Timur (Jakarta 12820) and Tebet Barat (Jakarta 12810) were the first area in Tebet Subdistrict to be developed. Planning of Tebet Timur and Tebet area follows a more or less garden city principle similar with older Kebayoran residential district in southern Jakarta: hierarchical roads, parks, supporting facilities such as schools and clinics, and good water catchment area. Some area in the Tebet residential area were designed as recreation park and water catchment area. One of this area was the park that is now known as Honda Park. Other parks, e.g. Rawa Bilal, has already been settled with housing that is now Jalan Tebet Mas. By the early 1970s, Tebet residential area had already made considerable progress. During the period, some streets were named to commemorate the era of Sukarno e.g. Ganefo Street, Nefo Street (after the GANEFO), Usdek Street, Berdikari Street, and Trikora Street. Tebet Barat and Tebet Timur Administrative Villages present a well-planned urban design example which contrast the relatively unplanned kampung-like area of Kebon Baru (and Gudang Peluru, Jakarta 12830) to the east of Tebet Timur Administrative Village and Menteng Dalam (Jakarta 12870) to the west of Tebet Barat Administrative Village. Kebon Baru and Menteng Dalam Administrative VIllage grew in the 1970s with no proper planning and as a result the area was prone to flooding and filled with relatively underdeveloped slum.

Parliament has indicated that inclusion of a question on religion was to provide useful demographics information for six key areas, namely \\"discrimination and racial disadvantage, social exclusion, health and community care planning, religious education in schools, regeneration of the inner cities, and helping voluntary sector religious groups\\". Legislation England and Wales The Parliament of the United Kingdom enacted the Census (Amendment) Act 2000 in order to provide for the asking of a question on religion in the census of England and Wales. Amendments were made to the original Bill by the House of Lords so that no person was to be subject to a penalty for refusing or neglecting to provide details in response to such a question. Scotland The Scottish Executive brought forward similar legislation, the Census (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2000. The Bill was originally introduced by Jim Wallace and passed through the Parliament, receiving Royal Assent on 10 April 2000. which introduced similar provisions for the inclusion of a question on religion in the census of Scotland. The Scottish Act also provided that a person would not be penalised for failing or refusing to declare a religion on the census.

Life and playing career Sheldon was born in Clay Cross, Derbyshire, England, and played for Nuneaton and Manchester United before being signed by the Liverpool manager Tom Watson in November 1913. Sheldon made his Liverpool debut on 29 November 1913 in the 2‚Äì1 First Division win over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield. He scored his first goal the following month on 6 December at Villa Park in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Aston Villa. The winger went on to miss only three games for the remainder of the 1913/14 season which included the whole of the FA Cup run when Liverpool reached their first final on 25 April 1914. The game was the last final held at the Crystal Palace ground and the first time to be played in front of a reigning monarch, George V. Burnley won 1‚Äì0 and it was another 51 years before Liverpool won the FA Cup. Sheldon had a decent 1914/15 season finishing second on Liverpool's appearance list and third on the goalscoring list. That season however, he became notorious for his part in the 1915 British football betting scandal, of which he was found to be the ringleader. He was banned ‚Äì initially for life ‚Äì along with the other players involved in the match fixing plot, but shortly afterward the start of the First World War saw the suspension of league football anyway. At the end of the war his ban was lifted and he returned to Liverpool where the following two years were much like those before the war, with Sheldon only missing 12 games during this period. Sheldon was forced into early retirement due to injury. His final game for Liverpool was on 16 April 1921 in a league match against Derby County, the game finishing 1‚Äì1.

Claudio Treves Life Youth Claudio Treves was born in Turin into a well off assimilated Jewish family. As a student he participated in the Radical milieu of Turin and, in 1888, he joined first his university's student radical circle, then the local independent labor union, influenced by the Milanese socialist Filippo Turati. In 1892 he graduated in law and made his way into the militant socialist community. PSI Treves became a member of the managing committee of the Piedmontese regional federation of the Partito Socialista Italiano (PSI), and in 1894, prosecuted under the 'exceptional laws' on sedition, he spent two months in prison. For some years after he travelled abroad, spending two years to Berlin, then on to Paris, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium and Scandinavia. All the while Treves was sending reports from these countries to Avanti!, the Italian socialist paper. He contributed to several newspapers and periodicals, among which were Per l'idea, Grido del popolo (which he edited from 1896 to 1898), Critica Sociale, Lotta, Lotta di classe, Rassegna popolare del socialismo, Riscatto and, finally, Milan's Universit√† popolare where he was on the editorial board until 1915. From the PSI to the PSU In 1899 he moved to Milan to become editor of the daily Il Tempo, which under his stewardship became a leading voice for greater democracy and the Italian Reformist Socialist movement. Working closely with Turati, in 1906 he was elected deputy from Milan. over the next decade, the PSI see-sawed between reformist and revolutionary factions. Seen as far too close to Giovanni Giolitti and the Liberals, Turati and the Reformists lost control of the party in 1904, regained it in 1908, only to lose it again in 1912. After the Milan conference of the PSI in 1910 he was named editor of Avanti!, a job in which he was succeeded in 1912 by Giovanni Bacci and later Benito Mussolini before the one time socialist's drift to the right. As a result of the division in the socialist movement between 'Maximalists' and Reformists, in 1922, with Turati, Giacomo Matteotti, and Treves founded the Unitary Socialist Party (PSU). He was named editor of the party's paper, La Giustizia, only to see it closed by state order of the new Fascist government in 1925. Exile In November 1926 Treves fled into exile, emigrating first to Switzerland and then to France, where he was one of the more frequent collaborators of the weekly journal of the PSLI (the underground successor to the now outlawed PSU), Rinascita socialista. In 1927 he was named editor of La Libert√†, journal of the Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana, a coalition of non-communist Italian anti-fascist groups. In 1930 he supported the unification of the PSLI and the PSI. Always attentive to the evolution of European Socialism, he attended the British Labour Party conference of 1930, the international trade union conference in Madrid in June 1931 and the conference of the Socialist International in Vienna in July 1931. He died on 11 June 1933, still in exile in Paris, and in 1948 his ashes were returned to Milan. Family Treves' son, Paolo Treves, later succeeded him as a militant of the PSI and editor of Avanti!, while his sister, Annetta Treves, was also active in Milanese politics. She is the mother of writer and activist Carlo Levi. In the Florestano Vancini's film The Assassination of Matteotti (1973), Treves is played by Manlio Busoni.

It was first published in 1922, and is in the public domain.See Buttel, p. 20. See also the LibriVox site on the complete public domain poems of Wallace Stevens. Stevens' biographer, Paul Mariani, identifies the poem as one of Stevens' personal favorites from the Harmonium collection.Mariani, Paul. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Whole Harmonium: The Life of Wallace Stevens,‚Äô‚Äô Simon & Schuster, 2016, pp. 149‚Äì198. The poem \\"wears a deliberately commonplace costume\\", he wrote in a letter, \\"and yet seems to me to contain something of the essential gaudiness of poetry; that is the reason why I like it\\".Stevens, Wallace. Letter to William Rose Ben√©t. 6 January 1933. Structure and meaning The simple poetic structure is of two stanzas related by an identical closing verse in each stanza. The poem is only clarified in its allusion upon completion of the reading of the second stanza which identifies a \\"cold\\" and \\"dumb\\" body as common references to a dead body. In this case a dead body is being prepared for a funeral. According to the critic Helen Vendler, quoted by Austin Allen, the ice-cream in the poem is being prepared for serving at a funeral wake. The use of holiday sweets and heavy desserts for funerals is part of the culture of varying civilizations. In this case the reference is likely to pre-Castro Cuba, which Stevens visited during business trips to Florida. The \\"emperor\\" of ice cream is illustrated through imagery by Stevens as sufficiently ruddy to churn the ice-cream and blend its sugar in order to make the customary funeral treat used in the country. Thomas C. Grey in his book on Stevens sees the poem as a harsh didactic lesson studying the use of the metaphor of \\"coldness\\" in Stevens. As Grey states: \\"Stevens knows the corruptions of coldness as well as its beauties. Chief among them is the heartless selfishness, represented by the sweet sinister cold of 'The Emperor of Ice-Cream.' In the kitchen a cigar- rolling man whips 'concupiscent curds' of ice cream as the wenches come and go; in the adjoining bedroom, a dead woman lies in undignified discard, 'cold ... and dumb' under a sheet, her horny feet protruding. Both rooms teach the cynical wisdom that 'The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream': what you see is what you get; look out for Number One; enjoy the sweet cold before the bitter cold claims you.\\"Grey, Thomas. The Wallace Stevens Case. Harvard University Press. 1991. Page 99-100. According to Norman Foerster, instigator of the New Humanist movement in American criticism, this poem has been discussed for a long time, but maybe we mistake an exact meaning. Foerster wrote: ‚ÄúAt this funeral (or wake) there is to be neither the pretense nor the fact of morbid grief.‚Äù These are expressed by ice-cream in this poem. At the same time there is neither disrespect for the dead nor a blinking of the fact of poverty and death. The world of his poem is a realistic and stable one. American Poetry and Prose / Norman Foerster and Robert Falk / Houghton Mifflin Company / 1960 According to Syunsuke Kamei, an honorary professor at the University of Tokyo and a scholar of American literature, this poem was composed by Stevens for his daughter. Stevens had a strong sense of fulfillment of life. He did not see death in a special light. This poem is telling us to take things easy, but seriously. Ice cream is an incarnation of a sense of fulfillment. It is easily melted, but it is a natural thing. Stevens tells us to enjoy the ice cream now.

Synopsis Private Godfrey requests leave to help an old flame gather in her harvest and Mainwaring, citing the harvest as vital to the war effort, offers the assistance of the platoon. Meanwhile, ARP Warden Hodges has a narrow escape from a falling bomb and, in a crisis of faith, decides to assist them. Plot The platoon is energised by the arrival of a Tommy Gun, or 'Chicago piano' as an excited Pike prefers to call it. While the men combatively discuss who is to have first turn of it, Godfrey reveals he has a problem. In the office, assisted by Jones, he reveals the truth. More than forty years before, as a 'dandy young buck' he had become involved with a friend, a young woman working as a servant in a nearby Great Hall. At first Mainwaring is naturally baffled as to the relevance of all this, but it turns out she had later married a farmer, and was now a widow, her fields needed harvesting (100 acres of wheat). Mainwaring, inspired by a burst of patriotic fervour, decides to harness the platoon to help with the harvest. They quickly drive out to the farm to offer their assistance. Meanwhile, Warden Hodges has had a life changing experience, having narrowly survived a bombing raid. He reveals that the German bomb had knocked the pint glass out of his hand, but not exploded. He attributes this to some form of higher destiny, and is now resolved to love his enemies, though \\"not Hitler of course\\", and having sought guidance from the Vicar, he decides to assist Captain Mainwaring in his work. Corporal Jones is acquainted with the machinery, and demonstrates it to the rest of them as best he can. Walker and Wilson appear more interested in three land girls. With an uncharacteristic unity the wardens and home guard work together, in the process they manage to overcome a number of problems and incidents, including Jones falling into the hopper and losing his trousers. After finally completing the job, they are delighted with their work. After consuming large amounts of potato wine in celebration, the platoon head outside for the Vicar to bless the harvest. The drink has turned them belligerent, and it descends into a mass brawl.

In mining, raw uranium ore is brought to the surface and crushed into a fine sand. The valuable uranium-bearing minerals are then removed via heap leaching with the use of acids or bases, and the remaining radioactive sludge, called \\"uranium tailings\\", is stored in huge impoundments. A short ton (907 kg) of ore yields one to five pounds (0.45 to 2.3 kg) of uranium depending on the uranium content of the mineral. Uranium tailings can retain up to 85% of the ore's original radioactivity. If uranium tailings are stored aboveground and allowed to dry out, the radioactive sand can be carried great distances by the wind, entering the food chain and bodies of water. The danger posed by such sand dispersal is uncertain at best given the dilution effect of dispersal. The majority of tailing mass will be inert rock, just as it was in the raw ore before the extraction of the uranium, but physically altered, ground up, mixed with large amounts of water and exposed to atmospheric oxygen, which can substantially alter chemical behaviour. Uranium tailings contain over a dozen radioactive nuclides, which are the primary hazard posed by the tailings. The most important of these are thorium-230, radium-226, radon-222 (radon gas) and the daughter isotopes of radon decay, including polonium-210. An EPA estimate of risk based on uranium tailings deposits existing in the United States in 1983 gave the figure of 500 lung cancer deaths per century if no countermeasures are taken.

She was a member of a group of five broadly similar battleships, along with Charles Martel, Jaur√©guiberry, Bouvet, and Carnot, that were ordered in response to the British . She was named in honour of Marshal of France Andr√© Mass√©na. Mass√©na significantly exceeded her design weight and suffered from serious stability problems that inhibited accurate firing of her guns; as a result, she was considered to be an unsuccessful design. Mass√©na served in both the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons during her career, which included a period as the flagship of the Northern Squadron. She was withdrawn from service before the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The following year, she was hulked at Toulon. She was later towed to Cape Helles at the end of the Gallipoli peninsula where on 9 November 1915 she was scuttled to create a breakwater to protect the evacuation of the Allied expeditionary force withdrawing from the Gallipoli Campaign.  Design  , which formed the basis for Mass√©nas design In 1889, the British Royal Navy passed the Naval Defence Act that resulted in the construction of the eight s; this major expansion of naval power led the French government to pass its reply, the Statut Naval (Naval Law) of 1890. The law called for a total of twenty-four \\"cuirasses d'escadre\\" (squadron battleships) and a host of other vessels, including coastal defence battleships, cruisers, and torpedo boats. The first stage of the program was to be a group of four squadron battleships that were built to different designs but met the same basic characteristics, including armour, armament, and displacement. The naval high command issued the basic requirements on 24 December 1889; displacement would not exceed , the primary armament was to consist of and guns, the belt armour should be , and the ships should maintain a top speed of . The secondary battery was to be either or caliber, with as many guns fitted as space would allow. The basic design for the ships was based on the previous battleship , but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel , which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings. Although the navy had stipulated that displacement could be up to 14,000 tons, political considerations, namely parliamentary objections to increases in naval expenditures, led the designers to limit displacement to around . Five naval architects submitted proposals to the competition; the design for Mass√©na was prepared by Louis de Bussy, the Inspector General of Naval Construction, who had previously designed the ironclad battleship and the armoured cruiser . Though the program called for four ships to be built in the first year, five were ultimately ordered: Mass√©na, , , , and . Mass√©na introduced the three-shaft arrangement for battleship propulsion systems; all previous capital ships used two steam engines. This would be the standard for all French pre-dreadnought type battleships until the begun in 1907. She and her half-sisters nevertheless were disappointments in service; they generally suffered from stability problems, and Louis-√âmile Bertin, the Director of Naval Construction in the late 1890s, referred to the ships as \\"chavirables\\" (prone to capsizing). All five of the vessels compared poorly to their British counterparts, particularly their contemporaries of the . The ships suffered from a lack of uniformity of equipment, which made them hard to maintain in service, and their mixed gun batteries comprising several calibers made gunnery in combat conditions difficult, since shell splashes were hard to differentiate. Many of the problems that plagued the ships in service were a result of the limitation on their displacement, particularly their stability and seakeeping.  General characteristics and machinery  A postcard showing Mass√©na at sea Mass√©na was long between perpendiculars, and had a beam of and a draught of . She was designed to displace at normal load, but she was significantly overweight when completed, and she displaced . This caused the ship to sit lower in the water than intended, which partially submerged her armoured belt, and in less favorable conditions, the belt was submerged completely. She was built with a pronounced snout bow to improve her buoyancy, which distinguished her from her half-sisters. Also unlike most of her half-sisters, she had a relatively minimal superstructure, which avoided the top-heaviness that plagued the other ships. Her forecastle deck was cut down to the main deck aft. The ship was fitted with two heavy military masts with fighting tops. She had a crew of 667 officers and enlisted men. Mass√©na had three vertical triple expansion engines each driving a single screw, with steam supplied by twenty- four Lagrafel d'Allest water-tube boilers. The boilers were ducted into a pair of widely spaced funnels. Her propulsion system was rated at , which allowed the ship to steam at a speed of ; this was a knot slower than her design speed of . Her failure to reach her designed speed was largely a result of the fact that she was significantly overweight. With only two-thirds of her boilers operating for more economic cruising, these figures fell to and , respectively. As built, she could carry of coal, though additional space allowed for up to in total.  Armament and armour  Mass√©na early in her career Mass√©nas main armament consisted of two Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns in two single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. Each turret had an arc of fire of 250¬∞. The placement of the forward gun turret close to the bow placed a great deal of weight too far forward. This exacerbated stability problems with the ship, and rendered accurate shooting more difficult. She also mounted two Canon de 274 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns in two single-gun turrets, one amidships on each side, sponsoned out over the tumblehome of the ship's sides. The 305 mm guns were an experimental 45 caliber version and had a muzzle velocity of , which produced a muzzle energy of 30,750 foot-tons and allowed the shells to penetrate up to of iron armour at a range of . This was sufficiently powerful to allow Mass√©nas main guns to easily penetrate the armour of most contemporary battleships. The 274 mm guns, which were 45 calibers long, had a similar muzzle velocity, but being significantly smaller than the 305 mm guns, produced a muzzle energy of 22,750 foot-tons and of iron penetration. Her secondary armament consisted of eight Canon de 138.6 mm Mod√®le 1891 guns, which were mounted in manually operated single turrets at the corners of the superstructure with 160¬∞ arcs of fire. For defence against torpedo boats, Mass√©na carried eight quick-firing guns, twelve 3-pounder quick-firers, and eight 1-pounder guns. Her armament suite was rounded out by four torpedo tubes, two of which were submerged in the ship's hull, the other two in trainable deck launchers. The ship's armour was constructed with Harvey steel manufactured by Schneider-Creusot. The main belt was thick, and ran for a length of along the hull. The belt terminated some from the stern, where it was capped with a transverse bulkhead that was . The belt was wide. Above the belt was thick side armour. The bulkheads at either end of the armoured belt were thick. The main battery guns were protected with of armour, and the secondary turrets had thick sides. The main armoured deck was thick, and the splinter deck below it was thick. The conning tower had thick sides.  Service  Mass√©na spent her career operating in the Bay of Biscay with the Northern Squadron and the western Mediterranean Sea with the Mediterranean Squadron Mass√©na was laid down at the Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire shipyard in September 1892 and launched nearly three years later on 24 July 1895. She was completed in June 1898 and entered service with the French fleet. Throughout the ship's peacetime career, she was occupied with routine training exercises that included gunnery training, combined maneuvers with torpedo boats and submarines, and practicing attacking coastal fortifications. The ship was commissioned in time for the Northern Squadron maneuvers conducted in July 1898. She was assigned as the flagship of the Northern Squadron and flew the flag of Vice Admiral M√©nard. The Northern Squadron conducted annual training exercises in June; the following month, they joined the Mediterranean Squadron for combined fleet maneuvers. In 1900, four engineering officers were seriously injured while disassembling a pipe to repair it. They had disassembled it too quickly, and were severely scalded by escaping steam. In June and July that year, she participated in extensive joint maneuvers conducted with the Mediterranean Squadron; she was still M√©nard's flagship during this period. The Northern Squadron initially held its own maneuvers in Brest, which included a simulated blockade of the squadron in Brest, after which the squadron made mock attacks on the island of Belle √éle and nearby Quiberon. In early July, the squadron met the Mediterranean Squadron off Lisbon, Portugal before the two units steamed north to Quiberon Bay and entered Brest on 9 July. Mass√©na and the rest of the Northern Squadron were tasked with attacking Cherbourg two days later. The maneuvers concluded with a naval review in Cherbourg on 19 July for President √âmile Loubet. In 1903, the ship was transferred from the Northern Squadron to the Mediterranean, where she was assigned to the Division de r√©serve (Reserve Division) along with her four half-sisters and the old battleship Brennus. On 18 August, the ship participated in a gunnery trial with the new battleship off √éle Longue. A mild steel plate thick, measuring , was attached to the side of Suffrens forward turret to determine the resistance of an armour plate to a large-calibre shell. Mass√©na anchored away from Suffren and fired a number of shells at the plate. The first three were training shells that knocked splinters off the armour plate. The last two shells, fired with full charges, cracked the plate, but Suffrens turret was fully operational, as was her Germain electrical fire-control system and the six sheep placed in the turret were unharmed. One splinter struck Mass√©na above her armour belt and left a 15-centimetre sized hole in her hull. Another splinter landed within a few metres of the Naval Minister, Camille Pelletan, who was observing the trials. Mass√©na scuttled as a breakwater off Gallipoli in 1915 During her period in the Reserve Division, Mass√©na was manned with a reduced crew that would be completed with naval reservists if the vessel needed to be activated for maneuvers or to take the place of a front-line battleship during a refit. Mass√©na was present for the 1907 fleet maneuvers, which again saw the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons unite for large-scale operations held off the coast of French Morocco and in the western Mediterranean. The exercises consisted of three phases and began on 2 July and concluded on 30 July. On 13 January 1908, she joined the battleships , , , , , and Jaur√©guiberry for a cruise in the Mediterranean, first to Golfe-Juan and then to Villefranche-sur- Mer, where the squadron stayed for a month. Mass√©na hosted President Armand Falli√®res during a major fleet review held off Toulon on 4 September 1911. On 16 October 1912, Mass√©na, Gaulois, Saint Louis, Carnot, Bouvet, and Jaur√©guiberry were activated for training duties as the 3rd Squadron of the Mediterranean Squadron; in July 1913, they were joined by Charlemagne. The squadron was dissolved on 11 November and Mass√©na returned to the reserve. Early in 1914, the French Naval Minister Ernest Monis decided to discard Mass√©na, owing to the cost of maintaining the obsolete battleship, which was by then more than fifteen years old. She was reduced to a hulk in 1915. That year, the Triple Entente had launched an invasion at Gallipoli in an attempt to capture Constantinople, knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war, and open a route to supply Russia via the Dardanelles. Too old for active service, Mass√©na did not take part in the ensuing Gallipoli Campaign, which had stalled by the end of 1915, having made no significant progress.

It was originally transmitted on 1 December 1972. Synopsis Jones arrives at the bank to deposit a donation by local shopkeepers of ¬£500 for the serviceman's canteen, but the packet that he hands over contains sausages, not money. Plot During a typical day at Swallows Bank, Mainwaring complains about Pike's unprofessional talk with customers and insists that Wilson and Pike continue to use the door to enter his office (despite the fact that bombs have destroyed most of the building and the door is pretty much the only part of the wall left intact). Jones comes in to deposit ¬£500 that has been raised by the local shopkeepers for the servicemen's canteen (Jones is the treasurer) and faints in shock when it turns out he accidentally brought a packet of sausages instead. Jones becomes obsessed with finding the money, annoying the rest of the platoon as they stay up all night to help him remember. Frazer offers to hypnotise Jones (which causes the Verger to think Frazer is practising satanism) and, under hypnosis, Jones remembers that he may have put the money in a chicken instead of giblets. The platoon rush to the house of Mr Blewitt, who bought the chicken, and demand to inspect it, much to the old man's confusion (Jones asks Mainwaring not to mention the lost money to keep Jones' good name untarnished). Unfortunately, a very confusing search is unsuccessful. Back at the bank the next day, Jones decides to pay the amount out of his own money, despite the fact that this will bankrupt him. Just then, however, Mr Billings comes into the bank to reveal that Jones gave him the money instead of the sausages the previous day by mistake, leaving the matter happily resolved (although Mainwaring will have to explain the 'mysterious' disappearance of the sausages, which he ate himself).

He is the author of several books and articles on fringe science, arguing in favor of the existence of the Loch Ness Monster and against Immanuel Velikovsky, and is an AIDS denialist. Following his retirement in 1999, he was editor-in-chief of the Journal of Scientific Exploration, a fringe science publication. Bauer also served as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Virginia Tech, generating controversy by criticising affirmative action. Life and work Henry Bauer was born in Austria. As the Nazis came to power in German-speaking Europe, Bauer and his family emigrated to Australia. He attended Sydney Boys High School from 1943-44. Bauer received his Ph.D. from the University of Sydney in Australia in 1956. He conducted post-doctoral research at the University of Michigan, then taught at Sydney and in Michigan. In 1966, he moved to a faculty position at the University of Kentucky. Bauer became dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in 1978, a position he held until 1986. Bauer was a professor of science studies and chemistry at Virginia Tech until his retirement in 1999. Bauer has had short-term teaching assignments at the University of Southampton and with a program of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science: at the University of Kyoto and in 1974 at Sophia University and Rikagaku Kenkyusho. Although trained as a chemist, Bauer's interests shifted in the late 1960s from electrochemistry to science studies, an interdisciplinary mix of history, philosophy, and sociology of science. His special interest is in what he calls \\"scientific unorthodoxies\\", like the Loch Ness Monster, Immanuel Velikovsky, and other topics. After retiring from Virginia Tech, Bauer became the editor of the Journal of Scientific Exploration, a publication devoted to fringe and non-mainstream science. He also wrote several books and maintains a website claiming that HIV is not the necessary and sufficient cause of AIDS (a position without scientific support that is known as AIDS denialism). From chemistry to science studies Bauer was trained as an electrochemist and reported his research in numerous publications during the 1950s and 60s. From the 1970s, although he remained a professor of chemistry in title, Bauer researched fringe science and pseudoscience topics. At Virginia Tech, Bauer was a founding member of a program for science studies. Bauer's book on science studies, Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method, was reviewed in ScienceGoodstein, David L. 1992. Rangings of the Mind, Science May 15, 256, p. 1034. and Nature.Galloway, John W. 1992. Madness to the method, Nature 6 August, 358, p. 464. In his review in Public Understanding of Science, John Ziman called Bauer \\"a stalwart veteran\\" of science studies.Ziman, John. 1993. Public Understand. Sci. 2, pp. 179-180. During his investigations of what constitutes pseudoscience, Bauer came to believe in the existence of the Loch Ness Monster, UFOsThe Roanoke Times (report that Bauer addressed a Virginia conference of the Mutual UFO Network): \\"UFO buffs sighted at lake awhile, then vanish: One in seven people claims to have seen one, but the meeting didn't draw much interest\\", Jay Conley, Roanoke Times, 28 September 2008. Accessed 28 September 2008. and other \\"scientific unorthodoxies\\". He compares the lack of acceptance of pseudoscientific beliefs by the scientific community to the persecution his family suffered at the hands of the Nazis, stating, \\"I guess I am kind of naturally contrary....I think you can make a pretty good case that it's not worth just accepting whatever is the standard.\\" Loch Ness Monster Bauer developed an interest in the Loch Ness Monster and based his belief in the Monster's existence on a film made by prominent \\"Nessie\\" enthusiast Tim Dinsdale. The film purportedly shows an object, commonly thought to be a boat, moving in the Scottish lake. In the 1980s, Bauer researched and wrote a book on the Loch Ness Monster and the popular fascination with it. \\"The Enigma of Loch Ness\\" was reviewed favorably in Isis. Bauer maintains a website arguing that there is strong evidence for the existence of the monster, which he says the media have conspired to trivialize and sensationalize. During his tenure as professor at Virginia Tech, Bauer took over twenty trips to Loch Ness, searching for the monster. In a news interview, Bauer commented on his belief in the Loch Ness Monster and how it has influenced his career: \\"I've been quite open about it....if I had been a biologist instead of a chemist, I couldn't have gotten away with it. People could smile and say, 'Well, he's got his hobbyhorse.'\\" Immanuel Velikovsky In his book, Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy, Henry Bauer criticizes the research of Immanuel Velikovsky, author of the pseudoscientific and pseudohistoric New York Times bestseller Worlds in Collision (1950). Time magazine refers to Bauer's book as \\"the definitive treatise debunking Immanuel Velikovsky.\\" Bauer's book on Velikovsky was reviewed in Science, Nature,Gingerich, Owen (1985).

Journal for the History of Astronomy 18, pp. 72-74. Positions Affirmative action and diversity programs Bauer says he left the Dean‚Äôs office at Virginia Tech \\"when political correctness arrived\\" in the 1980s. Bauer joined the National Association of Scholars, a politically conservative advocacy group opposing affirmative action, and started a newsletter for the group's Virginia branch. In \\"The Virginia Scholar,\\" Bauer argues that the implementation of diversity programs led to a decline in academic standards. He characterizes such programs as promoting \\"feminoid sexists calling men sexist\\" and \\"racist black fanatics calling others racist.\\" Bauer opposed the formation of a police \\"Sensitive Crime Unit\\" meant to deal with sexual assault and hate crimes at Virginia Tech, suggesting that these issues were not a serious problem on campus and did not merit special attention. Bauer called the police unit a threat to free speech. He criticized Virginia Tech‚Äôs creation of a new administrative position for multicultural affairs in response to racial incidents at the university in the mid-1990s as a wasteful allocation of resources. Bauer found fault with Virginia Tech‚Äôs policy of excusing student absences for attending religious or ethnic observances. As black enrollment at Virginia Tech declined during the 1990s, Bauer stated that the University was already doing too much (\\"pulling out all the stops\\") to attract minority students, and should instead concentrate on raising academic standards. Homosexuality Bauer also drew criticism for his comments on homosexuality. In his pseudonymously-written memoir To Rise Above Principle: The Memoirs of an Unreconstructed Dean, Bauer writes, \\"I regard homosexuality as an aberration or illness, not as an ‚Äòequally valid life-style‚Äô or whatever the current euphemism is.\\" In his book, Bauer attributes the perceived problem of homosexuality to genetic, hereditary, and environmental factors, and suggests that the free speech and other civil rights of homosexuals should be withdrawn to prevent what Bauer views as the negative effects of homosexuality from spreading. Bauer has since stated he no longer holds this view, saying he had been \\"wrong\\" about the issue and had, in particular, mistakenly relied on the \\"naturalistic\\" fallacy that reduced culture and ethics to biology. AIDSTruth.org, an AIDS information resource, notes Bauer posted the statement one day after an account of his views appeared on their website. AIDS Several years after retiring from Virginia Tech, Bauer began to assert that there are \\"substantive grounds for doubting that HIV is the necessary and sufficient cause of AIDS and that antiretroviral treatment is unambiguously beneficial.\\"See \\"Questioning HIV/AIDS: Morally Reprehensible or Scientifically Warranted?\\" on the list of papers In his 2007 book, The Origins, Persistence, and Failings of HIV/AIDS Theory, Bauer questions whether HIV exists, claiming that HIV tests are not accurate and that AIDS death statistics are exaggerated by mainstream media, scientists and pharmaceutical companies. Bauer‚Äôs beliefs on HIV/AIDS are rejected by the mainstream scientific community, based upon the substantial body of research confirming that HIV exists, is infectious, causes AIDS, and that HIV tests are accurate.\\"The evidence that HIV causes AIDS.\\" National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 2003.\\"The HIV-AIDS Connection\\", National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 2003. \\"Why is there overwhelming scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS?\\" Publications Books *(2017).

The outfielder and first baseman appeared for one full season, , in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Redlegs and was the first player of African descent to appear in an MLB game for the Cincinnati franchise. He threw and batted left-handed, stood tall and . Playing career Born in Santurce, Escalera started his baseball career at a very young age, often playing with his brothers and neighbors from the Loiza Street in his hometown. In 1946 at the Amateur Baseball World Series held in the Latin American Republic of Colombia, Escalera was named best first baseman and most valuable player (MVP) of the tournament. In 1950, the New York Yankees organization obtained Escalera from the Bristol Owls of the Colonial League. In 1952, he was purchased by the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association, and later that year, by the Cincinnati organization. On April 17, 1954 at Milwaukee County Stadium, a 24-year-old Escalera became the first black to play for the Cincinnati Reds franchise, known during the mid-1950s as the Redlegs. He entered the game in the seventh inning as a pinch hitter and hit a single in a 5‚Äì1 loss to the Milwaukee Braves. He played in 73 games during his only big league season, often as a pinch hitter. Season and career totals include a .159 batting average (11-for-69), three runs batted in, 15 runs scored, and an on-base percentage of .234. He committed just one error in 49 total chances for a fielding percentage of .980. On May 22, Escalara became the last left-handed thrower to play shortstop in a National League game. Escalera entered that game with two out and a baserunner on first in the eighth inning and took veteran starter Roy McMillan's place at shortstop. The hitter was the St. Louis Cardinals' Baseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial, who would set the NL record for career hits before his 1963 retirement. Facing right-handed pitcher Art Fowler, Musial struck out to end the inning, denying Escalera a fielding chance. He was replaced by Rocky Bridges for the ninth inning, and the Redlegs won the game, 4‚Äì2.Retrosheet box score: 1954-05-22 Escalera returned to the minor leagues in 1955 with the Havana Sugar Kings and he was selected to and played in the 1958 International League All-Star Game.

In 1982, he scouted for the San Francisco Giants. Among players signed by Escalera are retired major league players Jerry Morales, Ed Figueroa, Benny Ayala, Jos√© Oquendo and Juan Berenguer. Escalera is a member of the Puerto Rico Baseball Hall of Fame, R√≠o Piedras Sport Hall of Fame, Puerto Rico Sport Hall of Fame and Santurce Sport Hall of Fame.

It's called spurious because the thread has seemingly been awakened for no reason. But spurious wakeups don't happen for no reason, they usually happen because in between the time when the condition variable was signaled and when the waiting thread finally ran, another thread ran and changed the condition. There was a race condition between the threads, with the typical result that sometimes, the thread waking up on the condition variable runs first, winning the race, and sometimes it runs second, losing the race. On many systems, especially multiprocessor systems, the problem of spurious wakeups is exacerbated because if there are several threads waiting on the condition variable when it's signaled, the system may decide to wake them all up, treating every \`signal( )\` to wake one thread as a \`broadcast( )\` to wake all of them, thus breaking any possibly expected 1:1 relationship between signals and wakeups. If there are ten threads waiting, only one will win and the other nine will experience spurious wakeups. To allow for implementation flexibility in dealing with error conditions and races inside the operating system, condition variables may also be allowed to return from a wait even if not signaled, though it is not clear how many implementations actually do that. In the Solaris implementation of condition variables, a spurious wakeup may occur without the condition being signaled if the process is signaled; the wait system call aborts and returns \`EINTR\`. The Linux pthread implementation of condition variables guarantees it will not do that. Because spurious wakeups can happen whenever there's a race and possibly even in the absence of a race or a signal, when a thread wakes on a condition variable, it should always check that the condition it sought is satisfied. If it's not, it should go back to sleeping on the condition variable, waiting for another opportunity.

The Gysin sequence is a useful tool for calculating the cohomology rings given the Euler class of the sphere bundle and vice versa. It was introduced by , and is generalized by the Serre spectral sequence. Definition Consider a fiber-oriented sphere bundle with total space E, base space M, fiber Sk and projection map \\\\pi: S^k \\\\hookrightarrow E \\\\stackrel{\\\\pi}{\\\\longrightarrow} M. Any such bundle defines a degree k + 1 cohomology class e called the Euler class of the bundle. De Rham cohomology Discussion of the sequence is most clear in de Rham cohomology. There cohomology classes are represented by differential forms, so that e can be represented by a (k + 1)-form. The projection map \\\\pi induces a map in cohomology H^\\\\ast called its pullback \\\\pi^\\\\ast :\\\\pi^*:H^*(M)\\\\longrightarrow H^*(E). \\\\, In the case of a fiber bundle, one can also define a pushforward map \\\\pi_\\\\ast :\\\\pi_*:H^*(E)\\\\longrightarrow H^{*-k}(M) which acts by fiberwise integration of differential forms on the oriented sphere ‚Äì note that this map goes \\"the wrong way\\": it is a covariant map between objects associated with a contravariant functor. Gysin proved that the following is a long exact sequence :\\\\cdots \\\\longrightarrow H^n(E) \\\\stackrel{\\\\pi_*}{\\\\longrightarrow} H^{n-k}(M) \\\\stackrel{e_\\\\wedge}{\\\\longrightarrow} H^{n+1}(M) \\\\stackrel{\\\\pi^*}{\\\\longrightarrow} H^{n+1}(E) \\\\longrightarrow \\\\cdots where e_\\\\wedge is the wedge product of a differential form with the Euler class e. Integral cohomology The Gysin sequence is a long exact sequence not only for the de Rham cohomology of differential forms, but also for cohomology with integral coefficients. In the integral case one needs to replace the wedge product with the Euler class with the cup product, and the pushforward map no longer corresponds to integration.  Gysin homomorphism in algebraic geometry  Let i: X ‚Üí Y be a (closed) regular embedding of codimension d, Y ‚Üí Y a morphism and i: X = X √óY Y ‚Üí Y the induced map. Let N be the pullback of the normal bundle of i to X. Then the refined Gysin homomorphism i! refers to the composition :i^!: A_k(Y') \\\\overset{\\\\sigma}\\\\longrightarrow A_k(N) \\\\overset{\\\\text{Gysin}} \\\\longrightarrow A_{k-d}(X') where * œÉ is the specialization homomorphism; which sends a k-dimensional subvariety V to the normal cone to the intersection of V and X in V. The result lies in N through C_{X'/Y'} \\\\hookrightarrow N. * The second map is the (usual) Gysin homomorphism induced by the zero-section embedding X' \\\\hookrightarrow N. The homomorphism i! encodes intersection product in intersection theory in that one either shows or defines the intersection product of X and V as: X \\\\cdot V = i^![V]. Example: Given a vector bundle E, let s: X ‚Üí E be a section of E. Then, when s is a regular section, s^{!}[X] is the class of the zero-locus of s, where [X] is the fundamental class of X.

The song is included on their self-titled debut album. Its memorable riff, composed of only three chords (G, F‚ôØ and E), is played continuously throughout the song (excepting two brief 4-bar bridges). The 3-minute-and-9-second-long song, with its raucous, distortion-heavy guitar intro, pounding, single-note piano riff played by producer John Cale of The Velvet Underground, and steady, driving beat, established The Stooges at the cutting edge of the heavy metal and punk sound. The song notably uses sleigh bells throughout. In 2004, the song was ranked number 438 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

This is the highest rated episode of Dad's Army. 18.5 million viewers tuned into it. Synopsis At a rotary club dinner for several prominent people of the town representing professions and crafts, Mainwaring tries to ingratiate himself further with the upper classes with little success. As he talks to Jones (who is representing the butchers), He is annoyed when he discovers that Walker is in attendance as well, mostly because he was the one who supplied all the food and drink for the event. Whilst talking with Colonel Pritchard, Jones and Walker are hurt to discover that their platoon is being left out of exercises training a new unit of commandos made of various Home Guard personnel, in a scheme dreamt up by the Training Major. Mainwaring calls the idea a 'farce', citing that the commandos use brute force rather than cunning and intellect, a notion that the others agree with. Pritchard offers to get them involved in the exercises to let them prove their point which they eagerly accept. The platoon is challenged to plant a dummy bomb in the Officer-in-Charge's office located inside a secure compound, which is protected by a guarded bridge. After exhaustive suggestion taking from the others, they decide that they need a scheme to cross both the bridge and get into the compound; Walker then says that he has something in a warehouse near the compound that can help, and explains his plan: they disguise themselves as firemen as it would allow them to enter the office to plant the dummy bomb. To assist in this plan, they get a 'secret agent' to travel to the compound and start a fire in some wooden crates that would be left near the compound in advance. The following afternoon, they all meet up at Walkers warehouse and discover his secret weapon: an old fire engine. Unfortunately they learn too late that Wilson had arranged for The Verger to be the agent as Mrs Pike couldn't decide her outfit. As they are about to set off, they hear the air raid siren, which Frazer points out will help their credibility. While travelling in the old fire engine, everything is going smoothly according to plan, but they don't realise that the Verger was caught loitering near the compound, looking for the crates that had been cleared away. They are pulled over by Hodges, who tells them that a real fire is happening, forcing them to the rescue. Despite being out of the depth with the fire equipment, the platoon quickly connect up the hoses and start putting the fire out. Pritchard then arrives to tell Mainwaring that the bomb was delivered and they have won: Walker reveals that he arranged for a second dummy bomb to be sent through the post after the planning session the day before, which arrived in the morning post and was opened by the Training Major himself, thus proving that brains will always beat brawn.

The post-war music hall performer Stainless Stephen was a member.Sheffield City Battalion: The 12th (Service) Battalion York & Lancaster Regiment Sheffield City Battalion: The 12th (Service) Battalion York & Lancaster Regiment by Ralph Gibson and Paul Oldfield, p. 30 By 5 December 1914, there were 1,131 officers and men in the battalion. It was brigaded in the 94th Brigade of the 31st Division alongside the 1st and 2nd Barnsley Pals from the Yorks and Lancs and the Accrington Pals from the East Lancashire Regiment .  The Destroying  The 31st Division had been assigned to the defence of the Suez Canal but after arriving there it was sent back to France where it found itself in the line opposite the fortified town of Serre in April 1916. For the Somme offensive, the Sheffield City battalion would have the dubious honour of being on the extreme left of the 15-mile British front. On 1 July, at 7.20 am, the battalion moved into No Man's Land while the German lines were mortared. The Germans responded with a counter-barrage while the second waves were coming out of the trenches. At 7.30 am the bombardment stopped and the four waves of the battalion rose and advanced into a devastating hail of machinegun bullets and artillery fire. They were caught in machinegun fire from their exposed left and their front. The third and fourth waves were cut in half before they even reached No-Mans land. A few survivors made it to the German wire (uncut) and on the right wing some even found their way into the German front line. Few of these were able to return. Corporal Outram, a signaller, recalled that; > \\"as far as the eye could see, the last two men left standing on the > battlefield were himself and another signaller, A. Brammer. They signalled > to each other. Outram turned his head for a moment, and when he looked back > Brammer had gone.\\"Sheffield City Bn history The remnants of the battalion were taken out of the line on the evening of 3 July, having lost 513 officers and men killed, wounded or missing; a further 75 were slightly wounded. Serre would remain uncaptured until the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line in 1917. The Pals character of the battalion would never be regained, losing many more casualties before the end of the Somme campaign.

Originally created in 1994 as a subsidiary of the Gateway Western Railway, which acquired the East St. Louis-Kansas City line of the Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway in 1990, it was acquired by KCS along with its parent in 1997. History The line between East St. Louis and East Alton was completed by the Belleville and Illinoistown Railroad in 1856, as an extension of its Belleville-East St. Louis (Illinoistown) line. Ownership passed to the St. Louis, Alton and Terre Haute Railroad, a predecessor of the Illinois Central Railroad, but in 1890 that company sold that segment to the Cairo, Vincennes and Chicago Railway, which became part of the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Big Four) and eventually the New York Central Railroad and Conrail.Interstate Commerce Commission, 28 Val. Rep. 90 (1929), Valuation Docket No. 264: The Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company and its Leased Lines By 1906, the parallel Big Four and Chicago and Alton Railroad lines between Bridge Junction (East St. Louis) and Wann (near East Alton), the former just east of the latter, were being operated as a double-track line by both companies through reciprocal trackage rights.Interstate Commerce Commission, 40 Val. Rep. 1 (1932), Valuation Docket No. 851: Chicago and Alton Railroad Company et al. In July 1993, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved purchase by Gateway Eastern of this line from Conrail, as well as a segment of the ex-Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line (Pittsburgh to St. Louis) from the Mississippi River just north of the Eads Bridge to Conrail's Rose Lake Yard at Willows. A short segment of trackage rights over the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis's (TRRA's) Eads Subdivision, also acquired from Conrail, connected the two lines. Gateway Eastern also had access to CSX Transportation's Cone Yard, west of Willows. Operations began January 28, 1994. In order to connect its sections without trackage rights, Gateway Western bought a strip of land from CSX Transportation on which it planned to build the \\"Q Connection\\", crossing the TRRA north of \\"Q Tower\\". After a seven- year legal battle with the TRRA, during which Gateway Western placed the line in service in May 1995 through a temporary injunction, the courts ruled in favor of Gateway Western, then part of KCS, in 1998. Operations Gateway Eastern's primary business was switching ex-Conrail customers in the Alton area from Conrail's Rose Lake Yard (now CSX). It had one locomotive, a 1969 EMD GP38, and operated one scheduled train per day, five days per week. Interchange was with its parent Gateway Western, Conrail, and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company subsidiary SPCSL. The reciprocal trackage rights agreement from 1906 with the Alton continues to this day, now between Gateway Eastern and the Union Pacific Railroad (successor to SPCSL, purchaser of the ex-Alton main line).

Research and career His initial fluid mechanics interests included hypersonic aerodynamics, creeping flow, sloshing and channel flows and leading to flows in porous media, ship hydrodynamics and models for flow separation. He moved on to free and moving boundary problems. He pioneered the study of diffusion-controlled moving boundary problems in the 1970s his involvement centring on models for phase changes and elastic contact problems all built around the paradigm of the Hele-Shaw free boundary problem. Other industrial collaboration has led to new ideas for lens design, fibre manufacture, extensional and surface-tension- driven flows and glass manufacture, fluidised-bed models, semiconductor device modelling and a range of other problems in mechanics and heat and mass transfer, especially scattering and ray theory, nonlinear wave propagation, nonlinear oscillations, nonlinear diffusion and impact in solids and liquids.

In the mid-1970s, Gary Weis made some short films of Mead talking to his cat in the kitchen of his Ludlow Street apartment on Manhattan's Lower East Side called Taylor Mead's Cat. One film of Mead extemporizing on the virtues of constant television watching aired during the second season of Saturday Night Live. In 1995, Mead spent eight hours a day for a week at the Bon Temps bar, New Orleans, being documented in the photobooth costumed as a series of Warholian characters for Blake Nelson Boyd's documentary Photobooth Trilogy. Characters included Superman and Mickey Mouse from Warhol's Myth series and references to Mead's performances in Lonesome Cowboys and Nude Restaurant. While living on Ludlow Street, Mead read his poetry regularly at The Bowery Poetry Club. His first book of poems, \\"Taylor Mead on Amphetamines and in Europe\\", was written in 1968 (Republished by the Taylor Mead Estate, September 2015) His last book of poems (published by Bowery Poetry Books) is called A Simple Country Girl. He was the subject of Jim Jarmusch's documentary Excavating Taylor Mead, which debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2005. The film shows him engaging in his nightly habit of feeding stray cats in an East Village cemetery after bar- hopping, and features a cameo by Jim Jarmusch, in which Jarmusch explains that once, when Mead went to Europe, he enlisted Jarmusch's brother to feed the cemetery cats in Mead's absence. Mead appeared in the final segment of Jarmusch's 2003 film Coffee and Cigarettes.

Personal life and education Mouri√±o was born in Madrid to Carlos Mouri√±o, a Spanish immigrant to Mexico, who is the current president of the Spanish football team Celta de Vigo. Mouri√±o Terrazo studied economics at the University of Tampa and at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Campeche. Political career Mouri√±o served as local deputy in the State Congress of Campeche and as a federal deputy during the LVIII Legislature (2000‚Äì2003) of the Congress of the Union. In 2003 he unsuccessfully ran for municipal president (mayor) of Campeche. His political career had been linked to Felipe Calder√≥n: when Calder√≥n served as Secretary of Energy Mouri√±o was designated under-secretary of Energy; during Calder√≥n's presidential campaging he was the coordinator of the campaign first and then under-coordinator when Josefina V√°zquez Mota became general- coordinator. In September 2006 he was designated head of Calder√≥n's transition team and then on 1 December 2006, President Calder√≥n appointed him as the Chief of the Presidency's Office. On 15 January 2008, Mouri√±o was designated Secretary of the Interior. Scandals Juan Camilo Mouri√±o came under public scrutiny due to some contracts that appear to be signed by him as a representative of the companies owned by his father, while he was local deputy in Campeche, and later as an undersecretary of energy (under then energy secretary Calder√≥n), both government related positions. Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador showed also two new contracts that show that Mouri√±o could have incurred in abuse of power, since it seems he was still shareholder of the companies that benefited from these contracts. Death He was in a SEGOB- owned Learjet 45 that crashed into rush hour Mexico City traffic on 4 November 2008, killing all eight people on board. The crash occurred in one of the most up-scale districts of Mexico City, and only 1 kilometre from the Presidential Residence, Los Pinos. Secretary Mouri√±o had spent the day at an official function in the state of San Luis Potos√≠ and left the state capital's international airport at 17:00 local time. There is a confirmed number of 14 fatalities: five passengers (included him) three crew (pilot, co-pilot and one stewardess) and six people that were in ground zero, plus about 40 injured, as a result of the incident. Also among those who died was Mexican politician and lawyer Jos√© Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, who was travelling with Mouri√±o. Investigation The two black boxes that the police found in the accident were sent to the United States to help determine the cause(s) of the plane crash. In November 2009 the Mexican government announced that the main cause of the crash was turbulence encountered because of the pilot's failure to slow down in time and approaching too close to the wake turbulence of a 767.

As if that was not enough, the magistrate is none other than his old nemesis Captain Square. The Verger tries to warn off the Warden, but the Warden will not back down. The platoon tries to help by testifying as witnesses to Mainwaring's innocence, but things go from bad to worse when Jones messes up his story under oath. As both Square and Hodges proceed to push Mainwaring towards what could be a sticky end, Walker steps in and reveals he was out delivering 'supplies' to a 'nearby customer', putting some pressure on Square by reminding him of his own illegal activities buying blackmarket whisky. Just as Square is about to dismiss the trial, the Verger confesses it was he who showed the light, having used the office after the platoon had left on patrol to write his memoirs, much to the fury of Hodges who has lost his chance to end Mainwaring. The case is dismissed and Mainwaring is allowed to leave the court \\"without a stain on his character\\".

It incorporates a counterweight which slides along the longer arm to counterbalance the load and indicate its weight. A steelyard is also known as a Roman steelyard or Roman balance. A 19th-century steelyard. Structure The steelyard comprises a balance beam which is suspended from a Lever/pivot or fulcrum which is very close to one end of the beam. The two parts of the beam which flank the pivot are the arms. The arm from which the object to be weighed (the load) is hung is short and is located close to the pivot point. The other arm is longer, is graduated and incorporates a counterweight which can be moved along the arm until the two arms are balanced about the pivot, at which time the weight of the load is indicated by the position of the counterweight. Mechanism Roman steelyard from Pompeii The steelyard exemplifies the law of the lever, wherein, when balanced, the weight of the object being weighed, multiplied by the length of the short balance arm to which it is attached, is equal to the weight of the counterweight multiplied by the distance of the counterweight from the pivot. History Eighteenth century cart balance at Fountains Lane, Soham According to Thomas G. Chondros of Patras University, a simple steelyard balance with a lever mechanism first appeared in the ancient Near East over 5,000 years ago. According to Mark Sky of Harvard University, the steelyard was in use among Greek craftsmen of the 5th and 4th centuries BC, even before Archimedes demonstrated the law of the lever theoretically. The Latin name statera comes from the Ancient Greek œÉœÑŒ±œÑŒÆœÅ (stat·∏ór). Roman and Chinese steelyards were independently invented around 200 BC. Steelyards dating from AD 100 to 400 have been unearthed in Great Britain. Steelyards and their components have also been excavated from shipwrecks of the Byzantine period in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, such as the 7th-century wreck at Yassi Ada, Turkey, and the mid-first millennium shipwreck at Black Assarca Island, Eritrea. The Oxford English Dictionary suggests that the name \\"steelyard\\" is derived from steel combined with yard, influenced by a \\"misunderstood\\" allusion to the Steelyard, the main trading base of the Hanseatic League in London in the 14th century. Large steelyard balances (known as cart balances), both public and private, were a common feature in agricultural areas in England from the eighteenth century forward. An example of a public cart steelyard remains at Soham, Cambridgeshire and another is to be seen at Woodbridge, Suffolk. Function Steelyards of different sizes have been used to weigh loads ranging from ounces to tons. A small steelyard could be a foot or less in length and thus conveniently used as a portable device that merchants and traders could use to weigh small ounce-sized items of merchandise. In other cases a steelyard could be several feet long and used to weigh sacks of flour and other commodities. Even larger steelyards were three stories tall and used to weigh fully laden horse-drawn carts. Scandinavia's steelyard A Scandinavian steelyard is a variant which consists of a bar with a fixed weight attached to one end, a movable pivot point and an attachment point for the object to be weighed at the other end. Once the object to be weighed is attached to its end of the bar, the pivot point, which is frequently a loop at the end of a cord or chain, is moved until the bar is balanced. The bar can be calibrated so that the object's weight can be read off directly from the position of the pivot. This type is known in Sweden, Denmark and Norway.

International media were on hand, and supporting documents have been verified by Guinness. The hot dog was made as the central part of a media event surrounding the 50th anniversary of the All-Japan Bread Association. The wiener was made offsite at the Shizuoka plant prior to the day, and it was then cooked along with the bread in a ballroom at the Akasaka Prince Hotel in Akasaka, Tokyo, Japan. After the official measurement, the hot dog was cut up and eaten by those present. Technical challenges Creating a long hot dog is not much of a feat. This is because the hot dog is structurally quite sound, and remarkably flexible. In the August 2006 record breaking attempt, the hot dog was manufactured by Shizuoka Meat Producers, and wound into a large plastic barrel which was easily transported inside a delivery van. The limiting factor for breaking this type of record is the bun. The bun, in order to remain in one continuous unit, needs to be baked in its final form. For the All-Japan Bread Association, this meant the connection of the longest conveyor belt possible with the equipment available to them. The dough was assembled in half-meter sections, then pressed together to create a longer tube of dough, which was then fed through the ovens via conveyor, and carried away from the ovens by another conveyor. The key was to make sure that the already-cooked bun did not move at a faster rate than the bun behind it because this would cause the bun to pull apart. The wiener was fed through the oven at the same time to cook it. There also needed to be space outside the oven to store the bun and wiener until the entire bun had been baked. To allow for enough room for this to happen, the ovens and prep area were set up outside the ballroom of the Akasaka Prince Hotel on the loading dock, and the bun and wiener were fed into the ballroom along the conveyor as they exited the oven. Upon completion, the bun was sliced down the middle by bakers, and spectators were asked to don rubber gloves and first lift the wiener in one piece for photos, and then insert it into the bun. After being topped with mustard and ketchup, the completed hot dog was lifted by the assembled spectators off the conveyor for photos. Finally, the official measurement was completed, and the wiener was in length, with the bun coming in at in length. After photos and video of the official measurement were completed, the hot dog was cut into sections and the assembled spectators each had a piece. However, this only used about of the hot dog.

Synopsis Operation Catherine Wheel has been set up in order to test the War Office's latest weapon: a large, radio-controlled, high explosive-carrying wheel. The Walmington-on-Sea platoon is chosen for fatigues. When Pike and Walker sneak off to listen to the wireless, they cause interference for the wheel, which promptly rolls out of control. Plot The episode opens with a General briefing two others in the War Office building in 1941: the General briefs the others about a weapon called the High Explosive Attack Device Propelled by Ultra High Frequency (HEADPUHF) and the test called \\"Operation Catherine Wheel\\". Several local Home Guard units will be roped in to help during the test and the smarmy Captain Stewart tells them he will get the Walmington-On-Sea brigade to do the dirty work. When Captain Stewart arrives in Walmington-on-Sea to recruit the platoon, Captain Mainwaring misinterprets his hesitancy in describing what exactly they are required for to mean 'special duties' - Stewart allows him to believe this to get his co- operation. Mainwaring debriefs the platoon down in the church crypt to maintain secrecy, but ARP Warden Hodges barges in. Deciding they cannot trust him to keep quiet, they take him with them to the base where the test is taking place - Hodges is highly amused when it turns out that their 'special duties' include peeling potatoes. Private Pike gets bored and sneaks out back to Jones' van with Private Walker. It's revealed that Pike has built a kit radio and brought it along, so they try to tune in to the popular programme Hi Gang! Unknown to them, the signals from the radio interfere with the control signals for the secret weapon - a giant rocket-propelled wheel - and make it go berserk. It rolls out of the base and the Walmington-on-Sea platoon find themselves having to pursue it - if they don't stop it, it will explode and the town will be destroyed. The chase is a shambles, with the wheel repeatedly chasing the platoon's van and even appearing to ambush them - then they run out of petrol. When Walker suggests they could use Pike's radio to lure the wheel, Mainwaring is infuriated about Pike's secret radio, but they follow Walker's plan, with Mainwaring, Hodges and Pike taking off on a commandeered motorcycle. Knowing the only way to stop the wheel is to knock out its antennae, Lance-Corporal Jones suggests they head to a nearby railway bridge. As Pike and Mainwaring lure the wheel under the bridge, Jones is lowered down and manages to cut the antennae off with a pair of shears. The platoon gather around the fallen weapon as Jones reports \\"Mr. Mainwaring... I've killed it\\" and hang their heads in respect.

It passed with 56% of the vote. Background On November 3, 1992, Colorado voters approved Amendment 2, which added language to the state constitution that prohibited the state and all of its subdivisions from allowing \\"homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships\\" to provide the basis for any \\"claim any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination.\\" In 1994, the Colorado Supreme Court found the amendment unconstitutional. In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Romer v. Evans that the amendment, because it \\"allows discrimination against homosexuals and prevents the state from protecting them\\", was \\"motivated by animus towards homosexuals\\" and violated their rights under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Drafting The amendment was drafted by Lieutenant Governor Jane Norton and her husband, former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Norton. Lieutenant Governor Norton explained \\"If we really don't take a stand now, it's really a matter of time before we lose the uniqueness of marriage. If we lose the uniqueness of marriage, we lose a fundamental building block of society.\\" Content The amendment provided that the only marriages recognized under the state constitution would be between a man and a woman whether licensed and celebrated as provided by law or established by common law by a couple who live together and hold themselves out publicly as husband and wife.Colorado Blue Book Proposed Amendment 43, accessed January 24, 2013 At the time the amendment was adopted, the benefits of marriage in Colorado included collecting benefits such as pensions, life insurance, and workers' compensation without being designated as a beneficiary; jointly incurring and being held liable for debts; making medical treatment decisions for each other; protection from discrimination based on marital status in areas such as employment and housing; filing income taxes jointly; and ending a marriage and distributing property through a legal process. Campaign Groups in favor of Amendment 43 contended that it would preserve the commonly accepted and historical definition of marriage and that the marriage of a man and woman provides an optimal environment for creating, nurturing, and protecting children and preserving families. They also aimed to prevent the state courts from expanding the definition of marriage to same-sex couples. Groups opposed to the amendment argued that it was inappropriate to add the definition of marriage to the constitution's Bill of Rights, which defines individual rights. They also argued the amendment was itself an unconstitutional form of discrimination, and redundant in that same-sex marriage was already prohibited by both state and federal statute.

Also, the image data on which the operation is applied does not have to be defined in terms of intensity or color, it can be any type of information which is organized as a function of spatial (and possibly temporal) variables in . The result of applying a neighborhood operation on an image is again something which can be interpreted as an image, it has the same dimension as the original data. The value at each image point, however, does not have to be directly related to intensity or color. Instead it is an element in the range of the function , which can be of arbitrary type. Normally the neighborhood is of fixed size and is a square (or a cube, depending on the dimensionality of the image data) centered on the point . Also the function is fixed, but may in some cases have parameters which can vary with , see below. In the simplest case, the neighborhood may be only a single point. This type of operation is often referred to as a point-wise operation.  Examples  The most common examples of a neighborhood operation use a fixed function which in addition is linear, that is, the computation consists of a linear shift invariant operation. In this case, the neighborhood operation corresponds to the convolution operation. A typical example is convolution with a low-pass filter, where the result can be interpreted in terms of local averages of the image data around each image point. Other examples are computation of local derivatives of the image data. It is also rather common to use a fixed but non-linear function . This includes median filtering, and computation of local variances. The Nagao-Matsuyama filter is an example of a complex local neighbourhood operation that uses variance as an indicator of the uniformity within a pixel group. The result is similar to a convolution with a low-pass filter with the added effect of preserving sharp edges. There is also a class of neighborhood operations in which the function has additional parameters which can vary with : Visit each point p in the image data and do { N = a neighborhood or region of the image data around the point p result(p) = f(N, parameters(p)) } This implies that the result is not shift invariant. Examples are adaptive Wiener filters.  Implementation aspects  The pseudo code given above suggests that a neighborhood operation is implemented in terms of an outer loop over all image points. However, since the results are independent, the image points can be visited in arbitrary order, or can even be processed in parallel. Furthermore, in the case of linear shift-invariant operations, the computation of at each point implies a summation of products between the image data and the filter coefficients. The implementation of this neighborhood operation can then be made by having the summation loop outside the loop over all image points. An important issue related to neighborhood operation is how to deal with the fact that the neighborhood becomes more or less undefined for points close to the edge or border of the image data. Several strategies have been proposed: * Compute result only for points for which the corresponding neighborhood is well- defined. This implies that the output image will be somewhat smaller than the input image. * Zero padding: Extend the input image sufficiently by adding extra points outside the original image which are set to zero. The loops over the image points described above visit only the original image points. * Border extension: Extend the input image sufficiently by adding extra points outside the original image which are set to the image value at the closest image point. The loops over the image points described above visit only the original image points. * Mirror extension: Extend the image sufficiently much by mirroring the image at the image boundaries. This method is less sensitive to local variations at the image boundary than border extension. * Wrapping: The image is tiled, so that going off one edge wraps around to the opposite side of the image. This method assumes that the image is largely homogeneous, for example a stochastic image texture without large textons.

London: Hurst and Blackett (1856). 18 January 1853) was Lieutenant Governor of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Ancestry He was the only child of Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Campbell, of Airds, 6th Baronet by courtesy (15 March 1767 - 7 November 1834) and wife (m. 27 July 1803) Margaret Maxwell Campbell (c. 1776 - Woolwich, Kent, 19 August 1865), sixth daughter of John Campbell, Esq., of Lochend. Sir John Campbell, of Airds Bay, gained the rank of lieutenant colonel in the service of the Argyllshire and Bute Militia. In 1804 he claimed the baronetcy of Sir Donald Campbell, 1st Baronet, of Ardnamurchan and Airds, but this claim involves a descent from an illegitimate child. Career He was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 1845, in which office he served until his death at Kingstown on 18 January 1853. At that time, Saint Vincent was a British dominion, having been won from the French at the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 after changing hands more than once during the mid-18th century. As Lieutenant Governor he was the highest British authority on the island, the direct representative of the Queen. Title Although Sir John claimed the Baronetcy of Campbell of Ardnamurchan and Airds, his father was the first to claim it as successor to Sir Donald Campbell, the 1st Baronet. The intervening heirs (the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Baronets) did not assume the title. Although Sir John's father, himself, and his son considered themselves rightful heirs to the baronetcy, and used the title socially, the Standing Council of the Baronetage later refused to certify their claim. Eventually the baronetcy was re-created in 1913, but again fell dormant after the death of Sir John's grandson in 1943. Marriage and children On 21 November 1833, he married Hannah Elizabeth Macleod (c. 1813 - Twickenham, 4 November 1873), the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel James Macleod, Esq., 10th of Raasay (d. 1824) and wife Flora Maclean.Dod's Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage for 1858. London: Whittaker and Co. (1858). Their eldest son, John William Campbell succeeded him as 8th Baronet in 1853. He had at least another son, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Campbell (15 June 1843 - Airds, Sydenham Hill, Surrey, 13 September 1926), who married at Christ Church, Paddington, London, on 28 January 1869 Emilie Guillamine Maclaine (c. 1847 - Airds, Sydenham Hill, Surrey, 21 July 1928). They were the parents of Sir Edward Campbell, 1st Baronet. His great- great-great-great grandson is actor Jamie Campbell Bower. Another great-great- great-great-grandson is Ferdinand Zvonimir von Habsburg, heir to the Habsburg thrones.

It was originally transmitted on 29 December 1972. Synopsis A German pilot has bailed out and is now tangled up on the town hall's clock tower. Mainwaring's men are obliged to retrieve him. Getting up is not a problem - they can climb a makeshift ladder. Getting down again proves more difficult - Jones has broken the ladder. Plot The episode opens with Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson enjoying a relaxing morning coffee at the Marigold Tea Rooms when Pike bursts in announcing a Luftwaffe pilot has bailed out and landed on the roof of the town hall. Gathering together the rest of the platoon, they head straight for the town hall. When they arrive they find the ARP and Warden Hodges marshalling a large crowd of spectators, watching the stranded German on the clock tower. Mainwaring brusquely pushes Hodges aside and takes over command of the situation himself. He leads some of his men up a ladder to the tower, to try to rescue the German. After a number of failed attempts to rescue him, they eventually manage to reach the German using a pole found by Corporal Jones. Unfortunately the pole had been holding up the ladders up to the tower, which collapse, leaving them stranded. While Mainwaring puts the German pilot under close arrest, he and the rest of the men try to find a way to get back down. Meanwhile on the ground level, a sneering Hodges mocks their predicament, enraged because it was he who had erected the ladders in the first place. The platoon suggests various ideas of getting down. Fraser tells a story of two lighthouse keepers who were trapped in a lighthouse and decided to get out by dismantling it as they had gone mad from the isolation. Wilson tells a story his nanny told him: a Prince rescued a beautiful Princess trapped in a tower by firing an arrow into the tower; attached to the arrow was a piece of thread, attached to the thread was a piece of twine and attached to that was a rope which the Princess used to escape. Walker suggests using a rope in the tower to get down, Mainwaring claims he already noticed the rope and was waiting to see if anybody else would. When the men try to free the rope, they accidentally start up the clock tower. After Jones gets caught up in (and rescued from) the clock automatons, and several of the men's finest hats are ruined to silence the large bell in order to avoid a false invasion alert, an arrow loosed by the Vicar strikes the tower - a note wrapped around it states that there is a piece of thread attached to the arrow; attached to the thread is a piece of twine and attached to the twine is a piece of rope, just like in the fairytale Wilson's nanny told him.

A gravel and sand extraction facility in Meƒëimurje County, Croatia. Construction aggregate, or simply aggregate, is a broad category of coarse- to medium- grained particulate material used in construction, including sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world. Aggregates are a component of composite materials such as concrete and asphalt concrete; the aggregate serves as reinforcement to add strength to the overall composite material. Due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity value as compared to most soils, aggregates are widely used in drainage applications such as foundation and French drains, septic drain fields, retaining wall drains, and roadside edge drains. Aggregates are also used as base material under foundations, roads, and railroads. In other words, aggregates are used as a stable foundation or road/rail base with predictable, uniform properties (e.g. to help prevent differential settling under the road or building), or as a low-cost extender that binds with more expensive cement or asphalt to form concrete. Preferred for road construction are given in EN 13043 as d/D (where the range shows the smallest and largest square mesh grating that the particles can pass). The same classification sizing is used for larger armour stone sizes in EN 13383, EN 12620 for concrete aggregate, EN 13242 for base layers of road construction and EN 13450 for railway ballast. The American Society for Testing and Materials publishes an exhaustive listing of specifications including ASTM D 692 and ASTM D 1073 for various construction aggregate products, which, by their individual design, are suitable for specific construction purposes. These products include specific types of coarse and fine aggregate designed for such uses as additives to asphalt and concrete mixes, as well as other construction uses. State transportation departments further refine aggregate material specifications in order to tailor aggregate use to the needs and available supply in their particular locations. Sources for these basic materials can be grouped into three main areas: Mining of mineral aggregate deposits, including sand, gravel, and stone; use of waste slag from the manufacture of iron and steel; and recycling of concrete, which is itself chiefly manufactured from mineral aggregates. In addition, there are some (minor) materials that are used as specialty lightweight aggregates: clay, pumice, perlite, and vermiculite. History People have used sand and stone for foundations for thousands of years. Significant refinement of the production and use of aggregate occurred during the Roman Empire, which used aggregate to build its vast network of roads and aqueducts. The invention of concrete, which was essential to architecture utilizing arches, created an immediate, permanent demand for construction aggregates. Vitruvius writes in De architectura: > Economy denotes the proper management of materials and of site, as well as a > thrifty balancing of cost and common sense in the construction of works. > This will be observed if, in the first place, the architect does not demand > things which cannot be found or made ready without great expense. For > example: it is not everywhere that there is plenty of pit-sand, rubble, fir, > clear fir, and marble... Where there is no pit sand, we must use the kinds > washed up by rivers or by the sea... and other problems we must solve in > similar ways. Modern production The advent of modern blasting methods enabled the development of quarries, which are now used throughout the world, wherever competent bedrock deposits of aggregate quality exist. In many places, good limestone, granite, marble or other quality stone bedrock deposits do not exist. In these areas, natural sand and gravel are mined for use as aggregate. Where neither stone, nor sand and gravel, are available, construction demand is usually satisfied by shipping in aggregate by rail, barge or truck. Additionally, demand for aggregates can be partially satisfied through the use of slag and recycled concrete. However, the available tonnages and lesser quality of these materials prevent them from being a viable replacement for mined aggregates on a large scale. Over 1 million tons annually are mined from this quarry near San Francisco. Large stone quarry and sand and gravel operations exist near virtually all population centers due to the high cost of transportation relative to the low value of the product. Trucking aggregate more than 40 kilometers is typically uneconomical. These are capital-intensive operations, utilizing large earth-moving equipment, belt conveyors, and machines specifically designed for crushing and separating various sizes of aggregate, to create distinct product stockpiles. According to the USGS, 2006 U.S. crushed stone production was 1.72 billion tonnes valued at $13.8 billion (compared to 1.69 billion tonnes valued at $12.1 billion in 2005), of which limestone was 1,080 million tonnes valued at $8.19 billion from 1,896 quarries, granite was 268 million tonnes valued at $2.59 billion from 378 quarries, traprock was 148 million tonnes valued at $1.04 billion from 355 quarries, and the balance other kinds of stone from 729 quarries. Limestone and granite are also produced in large amounts as dimension stone. The great majority of crushed stone is moved by heavy truck from the quarry/plant to the first point of sale or use. According to the USGS, 2006 U.S. sand and gravel production was 1.32 billion tonnes valued at $8.54 billion (compared to 1.27 billion tonnes valued at $7.46 billion in 2005), of which 264 million tonnes valued at $1.92 billion was used as concrete aggregates. The great majority of this was again moved by truck, instead of by electric train. Currently, total U.S. aggregate demand by final market sector was 30%‚Äì35% for non-residential building (offices, hotels, stores, manufacturing plants, government and institutional buildings, and others), 25% for highways, and 25% for housing. Recycled materials for aggregates The largest-volume of recycled material used as construction aggregate is blast furnace and steel furnace slag. Blast furnace slag is either air-cooled (slow cooling in the open) or granulated (formed by quenching molten slag in water to form sand-sized glass-like particles). If the granulated blast furnace slag accesses free lime during hydration, it develops strong hydraulic cementitious properties and can partly substitute for portland cement in concrete. Steel furnace slag is also air- cooled. In 2006, according to the USGS, air-cooled blast furnace slag sold or used in the U.S. was 7.3 million tonnes valued at $49 million, granulated blast furnace slag sold or used in the U.S. was 4.2 million tonnes valued at $318 million, and steel furnace slag sold or used in the U.S. was 8.7 million tonnes valued at $40 million. Air-cooled blast furnace slag sales in 2006 were for use in road bases and surfaces (41%), asphaltic concrete (13%), ready- mixed concrete (16%), and the balance for other uses. Granulated blast furnace slag sales in 2006 were for use in cementitious materials (94%), and the balance for other uses. Steel furnace slag sales in 2006 were for use in road bases and surfaces (51%), asphaltic concrete (12%), for fill (18%), and the balance for other uses. Glass aggregate, a mix of colors crushed to a small size, is substituted for many construction and utility projects in place of pea gravel or crushed rock, often saving municipalities like the City of Tumwater, Washington Public Works, thousands of dollars (depending on the size of the project). Glass aggregate is not sharp to handle. In many cases, the state Department of Transportation has specifications for use, size and percentage of quantity for use. Common applications are as pipe bedding‚Äîplaced around sewer, storm water or drinking water pipes to transfer weight from the surface and protect the pipe. Another common use would be as fill to bring the level of a concrete floor even with a foundation. Use of glass aggregate helps close the loop in glass recycling in many places where glass cannot be smelted into new glass. Aggregates themselves can be recycled as aggregates. Unlike deposits of sand and gravel or stone suitable for crushing into aggregate, which can be anywhere and may require overburden removal and/or blasting, \\"deposits\\" of recyclable aggregate tend to be concentrated near urban areas, and production from them cannot be raised or lowered to meet demand for aggregates. Supply of recycled aggregate depends on physical decay of structures and their demolition. The recycling plant can be fixed or mobile; the smaller capacity mobile plant works best for asphalt-aggregate recycling. The material being recycled is usually highly variable in quality and properties. Many aggregate products of various types are recycled for other industrial purposes with economic and environmental benefits to the local and surrounding area. Contractors save on disposal costs and less aggregate is buried or piled and abandoned. In Bay City, Michigan, for example, a recycle program exists for unused products such as mixed concrete, block, brick, gravel, pea stone, and other used materials. The material is crushed to provide subbase for roads and driveways, among other purposes. According to the USGS in 2006, 2.9 million tonnes of Portland cement concrete (including aggregate) worth $21.9 million was recycled, and 1.6 million tonnes of asphalt concrete (including aggregate) worth $11.8 million was recycled, both by crushed stone operations. Much more of both materials are recycled by construction and demolition firms not in the USGS survey. For sand and gravel, the USGS survey for 2006 showed that 4.7 million tonnes of cement concrete valued at $32.0 million was recycled, and 6.17 million tonnes of asphalt concrete valued at $45.1 million was recycled. Again, more of both materials are recycled by construction and demolition firms not in this USGS survey. The Construction Materials Recycling Association indicates that there are 325 million tonnes of recoverable construction and demolition materials produced annually. Many geosynthetic aggregates are also made from recycled materials. Being polymer based, recyclable plastics can be reused in the production of these new age aggregates. For example, Ring Industrial Group's EZflow product lines are produced with geosynthetic aggregate pieces that are more than 99.9% recycled polystyrene. This polystyrene, that would have otherwise been destined for a landfill, is instead gathered, melted, mixed, reformulated and expanded to create low density aggregates that maintain high strength properties while under compressive loads. Such geosynthetic aggregates replace conventional gravel while simultaneously increasing porosity, increasing hydraulic conductivity and eliminating the fine dust \\"fines\\" inherent to gravel aggregates which otherwise serve to clog and disrupt the operation of many drainage applications. Recycled aggregate production in the UK Recycled aggregate in the UK is defined as aggregate resulting from the processing of inorganic material previously used in construction. To ensure the aggregate is inert, it is manufactured from material tested and characterised under European Waste Codes.http://www.grdp.org/static/documents/EWC_31-03-09_CH.pdf In 2008, 210 million tonnes of aggregate were produced in the UK of which 67 million tonnes was recycled product, according to the Quarry Products Association. The Waste and Resource Action Programme has produced a Quality Protocol for the regulated production of recycled aggregates. The recycled aggregate is delivered with documentation that states it has been produced using a quality assured system for the manufacturing process to ensure an aggregate that conforms to the relevant European standards.

The constant volume gas thermometer plays a crucial role in understanding how absolute zero could be discovered long before the advent of cryogenics. Consider a graph of pressure versus temperature made not far from standard conditions (well above absolute zero) for three different samples of any ideal gas (a, b, c). To the extent that the gas is ideal, the pressure depends linearly on temperature, and the extrapolation to zero pressure occurs at absolute zero. Note that data could have been collected with three different amounts of the same gas, which would have rendered this experiment easy to do in the eighteenth century.

In 1999 the administration of the province was handed on an interim basis to the United Nations under the terms of UNSCR 1244 which ended the Kosovo conflict of that year. That resolution reaffirmed the sovereignty of Serbia over Kosovo but required the UN administration to promote the establishment of 'substantial autonomy and self-government' for Kosovo pending a 'final settlement' for negotiation between the parties. The UN-sponsored talks began in February 2006, and though no agreement was reached between the parties, a proposal from UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari was presented in May 2007 which recommended 'supervised independence' for the province. After many weeks of discussions at the UN in New York, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. On 17 February 2008 representatives of the people of Kosovo, acting outside the UNMIK's PISG framework issued a declaration of independence establishing the Republic of Kosovo. The International Court of Justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law and argued that the signatory authors represented the broad will of the People of Kosovo, rather than the Assembly of Kosovo under the umbrella of UN resolution 1244. Background Status in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Map showing banovinas in 1929 Following the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì13) and the Treaties of London and Bucharest, which led to the Ottoman loss of most of the Balkans, Kosovo was governed as an integral part of the Kingdom of Serbia, while its western part (Metohija) by the Kingdom of Montenegro. Noel Malcolm argues that since the 1903 Serbian constitution was still in force at that time, Kosovo should constitutionally not have become part of Serbia, claiming that the constitution required a Grand National Assembly be held before Serbia could expand its borders, but no such assembly was ever held. In 1918 Montenegro was united with Serbia, subsequently forming the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSHS), recognized in 1919 and 1920 at the Paris Peace Conference and the League of Nations and gaining a Constitution in 1921. In 1922 the historical entities were abolished by a state commission and 33 new administrative oblasts (regions) ruled from the centre were instituted. In 1926 the border dispute with the Albanian Republic was resolved with most of the Gora region remaining in the Kingdom. In 1929, the Kingdom (renamed formally to \\"Yugoslavia\\") was restructured into nine large provinces called banovinas (banates), formalized by a new Constitution in 1931. Their borders were intentionally drawn so that they would not correspond either to boundaries between ethnic groups or to pre-World War I state borders. Most of Kosovo was allocated to the Zeta Banate and smaller bits to the Moravian and Vardar Banates. Status in Communist Yugoslavia The first Constitution of the Federative People's Republic of Yugoslavia (later renamed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, SFRY) established Kosovo-Metohija and the northern region of Vojvodina as autonomous provinces within the People's Republic of Serbia. It also promoted the Vardar region of southern Serbia to the status of a separate republic, the People's Republic of Macedonia. The constitution, adopted on 31 January 1946, stated that \\"The People's Republic of Serbia includes the autonomous province of Vojvodina and the autonomous Kosovo-Metohijan region.\\" It did not spell out the rights and scope of the autonomous provinces, instead stating that this was a matter to be \\"determined by the constitution of the [parent] republic.\\" The later Constitution of the SFRY, adopted on 7 April 1963, again provided for republics to \\"found autonomous provinces in accordance with the constitution in areas with distinctive national characteristics or in areas with other distinguishing features, on the basis of the express will of the population of this area.\\" Within the Socialist Republic of Serbia, \\"there are the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo and Metohija, established in 1945 by the decision of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Serbia in accordance with the express will of the population of these areas.\\" The details of the rights and scope of the provinces was, again, reserved to the republics' constitutions. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution, at the time the world's longest, greatly changed the constitutional setup within Yugoslavia. It increased the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina, and gave both autonomous provinces de facto veto power in the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments as changes to their status could not be made without the consent of the two Provincial Assemblies. It also granted equal status to the Serbian, Albanian and Turkish languages and alphabets within Kosovo. This created anomalous situation sometimes said to be unique in world history, in which any of the provinces of Serbia could veto a decision pertaining to entire Serbia, while the parliament of Serbia could not influence decisions of the provincial parliaments. This led to central Serbia, which was not a political unit, is effectively under the control of the provinces. The 1974 Serbian constitution, adopted at the same time, reiterated that \\"the Socialist Republic of Serbia comprises the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo, which originated in the common struggle of nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia in the National Liberation War [the Second World War] and socialist revolution....\\" The separately promulgated Constitution of the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo declared that: The expansion of Kosovo's powers caused considerable discontent among Serbs, and Serbian politicians campaigned for a reversion of status changes. It became a rallying cry for a new generation of Serbian politicians. During the 1980s the moderate Serbian communist politician Ivan Stamboliƒá, who became President of Serbia, urged the other republics to agree to a reduction in provincial autonomy. Stamboliƒá managed to win over the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ) to his position on this matter at the 13th Congress of the SKJ, held in 1986, and then set up a commission to work out the details of constitutional reforms. However, Stamboliƒá was deposed by his erstwhile prot√©g√© Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in 1987, who had used the issue of Kosovo to boost his political support.  Under Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá  The much harder-line Milo≈°eviƒá pushed for a tougher policy towards the Kosovo Albanians. On 28 March 1989 he had the Serbian Constitution amended to give the Serbian Assembly exclusive rights to decide on the constitutional structure of the country, overturning the veto right of Kosovo and Vojvodina. According to the ICTY indictment of Milo≈°eviƒá, when the proposed amendments were put before the Kosovo Assembly, the majority of the Assembly's members abstained in protest and the vote failed to reach the necessary two-thirds supermajority. The speaker of the Assembly nonetheless declared that the amendments had passed and they were duly enacted. This however was refuted in court by Vuka≈°in Jokanoviƒá who was the president of the Kosovo Assembly at the time during the trial. He provided the court with a video recording of the vote along with the stenographic notes of the assembly session which clearly showed the assembly members voting in favour of the constitutional amendments by the required majority. The following year, a new Serbian Constitution was enacted that drastically reduced the powers of the autonomous provinces, reserving many formerly autonomous rights to the central authorities in Belgrade. It also changed back the name of Kosovo from the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo to the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, returning the province to the status predating the 1970s and using the Serbian name for the western part of the region. The 1990 constitution was strongly resisted by Kosovo's Albanians, who set up a \\"shadow\\" government to parallel the official Serb-dominated establishment. The Albanian-dominated Kosovo Assembly passed an unofficial resolution declaring Kosovo an independent entity within Yugoslavia, equivalent in status to the existing republics. A few days later the Kosovo Assembly was formally dissolved by the Serbian parliament on 5 July 1990, all its laws declared invalid and its legislative functions transferred to the Belgrade legislature. On 22 September 1991, the deposed Albanian members of the Kosovo Assembly met secretly in Pristina to declare Kosovo an independent sovereign state, the \\"Republic of Kosova\\". Albania was the only country to recognize the independence.Louis Sell, Slobodan Milosevic and the Destruction of Yugoslavia, p. 93. (Duke University Press, 2003) Kosovo independence was also not supported by the international community, which had maintained a consistent policy since 1991 of upholding the existing borders of the individual republics of Yugoslavia. On 10 October 1991 the CSCE (now the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) warned that member states would \\"never ... recognize any changes of borders, whether external or internal, brought about by force.\\" The United States, the European Community and the Soviet Union issued a joint statement on 18 October 1991 reaffirming these principles.Suzanne N. Lalonde, Determining Boundaries in a Conflicted World: The Role of Uti Possidetis, p. 176 (McGill-Queen's Press, 2002) The same set of principles remained the cornerstone of international policy towards the former Yugoslavia throughout the Yugoslav wars. Thus, for instance, the international community insisted on retaining Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia as unified states, denying recognition to the breakaway Republika Srpska and Republic of Serbian Krajina. Status and the Kosovo War Kosovo's status was a key issue in the political violence that presaged the Kosovo War of 1999. The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army was formed after the initial attack of Serbian forces at the village of Raƒçak, where 40 men and boys were executed by Serbian forces. The international community also did not support independence for Kosovo at this stage. The United Nations Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 1160 on 31 March 1998 urging the parties to reach a peaceful settlement and rejecting any unilateral attempts to redraw borders, instead \\"affirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\\" The same principles were reaffirmed in a high-level meeting during the 1999 NATO bombing campaign when the G8 foreign ministers adopted a policy of establishing \\"an interim administration for Kosovo ... under which the people of Kosovo can enjoy substantial autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\". On 2 June 1999, a joint Finnish- Russian team headed by former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari presented a set of proposals to President Milo≈°eviƒá. These included a commitment to establish \\"an interim political framework agreement providing for substantial self-government for Kosovo, taking full account of the Rambouillet accords and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries of the region.\\" Under severe pressure from the ongoing NATO bombing, Milo≈°eviƒá agreed to withdraw Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and permit the establishment of an UN-led administration in the province, with security to be provided by a NATO-led force (KFOR).A.R. Groom & Paul Taylor, \\"The United Nations system and the Kosovo crisis\\", p.303, in Kosovo and the Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention, eds. Albrecht Schnabel, Ramesh Chandra Thakur. (United Nations University Press, 2000) Temporary administration of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo US Central Intelligence Agency map of Serbia as of June 2006, including the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina (north) and Kosovo (south) Kosovo's constitutional status of the period June 1999-February 2008 was established by the United Nations in UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1244, adopted on 10 June 1999. The Security Council placed Kosovo under the temporary administration of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), under the leadership of a Special Representative of the Secretary General. It also explicitly upheld the existing sovereignty of Serbia over Kosovo, \\"reaffirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other States of the region, as set out in the Helsinki Final Act and annex 2 [the Finnish-Russian proposals].\\" It also established a requirement that the post-conflict status process must take full account of \\"the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\\" In a public speech on 9 June 1999, President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá declared: The reality on the ground was rather different, as Ylber Hysa has noted. Although \\"Resolution 1244 respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo\\", and even provided for Serbian troops to be stationed in the province, on the ground \\"certain territories are under the full control of KFOR and the international administration\\" without any Serbian involvement.Ylber Hysa, \\"Kosovo: a permanent international protectorate?\\", p. 288 in The UN Role in Promoting Democracy: Between Ideals and Reality, eds. Edward Newman, Roland Rich (United Nations University Press, 2004) However, this part of the resolution was never implemented. The severely circumscribed control exercised by Serbia in Kosovo has led many commentators to describe the nature of its sovereignty as purely \\"nominal\\". William G. O'Neill comments that the resolution's wording was also intended \\"to reassure Republic of Macedonia, which has a substantial Albanian minority, that its territorial borders were not at risk. It also can be seen as a warning to Albania not even to think about any territorial expansion to create a 'greater Albania'.\\"William G O'Neill, Kosovo: An Unfinished Peace, p. 35. (Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2001) On 15 May 2001, UNMIK enacted a \\"Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government.\\" Although it provides a constitutional framework, it is not a constitution, and is deliberately nonjudgmental on the question of sovereignty, as UNMIK itself does not have a role in the determination of Kosovo's final status.Joachim R√ºcker, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of UNMIK. Record of the 5522nd meeting , Wednesday, 13 September 2006 It defines Kosovo as \\"an entity under interim international administration\\" and \\"an undivided territory\\". Crucially, Kosovo's own institutions were specifically barred from making any unilateral decisions about the province's status. The Constitutional Framework states that the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) \\"shall not in any way affect or diminish the ultimate authority of the SRSG [Special Representative of the Secretary General] for the implementation of UNSCR 1244\\". The Kosovo Assembly is in effect prohibited to make any decisions or declarations on the future status of KosovoH√¶kkerup, Hans. Kosovos mange ansigter Lindhart og Ringhof, 2002 There are no Ministers for Foreign Affairs or Defence as these functions are reserved to the authority of the SRSG. UNMIK eventually approved the creation of Ministries of Justice and Internal Affairs in late 2005, but noted that the establishment of the ministries was not linked to the question of Kosovo's final status. The 2003 Constitution of the newly created state of Serbia and Montenegro officially acknowledged Kosovo's new interim status, describing Serbia and Montenegro as \\"the state of Montenegro and the state of Serbia which includes the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, the latter currently under international administration in accordance with UN SC resolution 1244.\\" In 2006, Serbia drafted a new constitution that again referred to Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia. Serbia's interference in Kosovo has caused significant problems. UNMIK was given exclusive rights to manage Kosovo's economic affairs and stated its intent in the Constitutional Framework to establish a market economy. Prior to 1999, much of Kosovo's economy had been controlled by the state. All publicly owned enterprises were owned by the Yugoslav government or the Serbian state, both governed from Belgrade. When UNMIK began implementing privatization of assets that it did not own, Serbs with interests in the companies subject to privatization sued first UNMIK and then the UN in New York. Swedish economist Jessica Johnsson claims that the fact that Kosovo is still regarded in law as being part of Serbia, as well as the ongoing political tensions, has caused it significant difficulties in achieving economic development and that its uncertain legal status has prevented it from accessing lending from International Financial Institutions such as the World Bank. Resolution 1244 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, passed in 1999, reaffirmed in its preamble the \\"commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\" and authorised \\"an international civil presence in Kosovo in order to provide an interim administration for Kosovo under which the people of Kosovo can enjoy substantial autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\", i.e. the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), with security provided by a NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR). The Resolution also authorised a process to determine Kosovo's final status. Concerning the latter, Annex 1 to the Resolution states that the \\"political solution to the Kosovo crisis\\" should take \\"full account of ... the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\". Status process (2006‚Äì2008) Initial UN-backed talks (2006) The UN-facilitated Kosovo future status process was led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, former president of Finland; Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan is his deputy. Ahtisaari's office ‚Äî the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo (UNOSEK) ‚Äî is located in Vienna, Austria, and includes liaison staff from NATO, the EU and the United States. Ahtisaari is supported in his efforts by Ambassador Frank G. Wisner, the U.S. Representative to the Kosovo Status Talks.\\"Appointment of Ambassador Frank G. Wisner As The Special Representative of the Secretary of State to the Kosovo Status Talks \\", by Condoleezza Rice, Washington, DC, 19 December 2005. Ahtisaari holds regular meetings with representatives of the Contact Group. The initial status negotiations focused on technical issues important for Kosovo's long-term stability, particularly the rights and protection of Kosovo's minorities (especially the Kosovo Serbs). Ahtisaari brought the parties together for the first direct dialogue in February 2006 to discuss decentralization of local government, which is an important measure to protect Kosovo Serb communities. Subsequent meetings addressed economic issues, property rights, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional guarantees for the rights of Kosovo's minorities. On 24 July 2006, Ahtisaari brought the parties together in Vienna for the first high-level talks on the status outcome itself. Serbian President Boris Tadiƒá, Prime Minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Agim √áeku attended and presented their respective platforms for Kosovo's future status. Ahtisaari later told the press that the meeting resulted in no breakthroughs, but added that the discussion was \\"frank and candid\\" and the atmosphere was better than he could have expected.\\"Serbian, Kosovo Albanian talks fail to reach breakthrough on future status \\" Agence France-Presse (AFP), Vienna, 24 July 2006. Ahtisaari briefed Contact Group foreign ministers on 20 September 2006, in New York City at a meeting chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. At that meeting, the Contact Group released a press statement that reaffirmed its desire to work towards a negotiated settlement in the course of 2006 and also endorsed Ahtisaari's plans to develop a comprehensive proposal for a status settlement.Kosovo Contact Group Ministerial Statement , New York, 20 September 2006. After consultations with the Contact Group in Vienna on 10 November, Ahtisaari decided to delay sharing his proposal with the parties until after Serbia held parliamentary elections on 21 January 2007. He said he would take his proposal to the parties \\"without delay\\" after these elections.\\"UN delays report on Kosovo future \\", BBC News, 10 November 2006.; Statement by Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari after consultations with the Contact Group , 10 November 2006 (.pdf file). Continued discussions On 3 April, Ahtisaari presented to the UN Security Council his final package of proposals, which included a clear recommendation that Kosovo should become independent subject to a period of international supervision.\\"Kosovo's status - the wheels grind on\\", The Economist, 6 October 2005.\\"Negotiations Lean Toward Independence\\", Der Spiegel, 20 February 2006. Pristina accepted Ahtisaari's final Settlement, while Belgrade rejected it. Immediately after the proposals became public, the United States and Germany (in its capacity as EU Presidency) issued strong statements of support. The European Union's Parliament also declared its full support to Ahtisaari's plan. Russia, however, called for new rounds of negotiations, possibly with a new special envoy. At least one other member of the Security Council, South Africa, a non-permanent member, has expressed agreement with Russian concerns.The dark shadows hanging over Kosovo Bronwen Maddox: World Briefing - Times Online On 11 May, European members of the UN Security Council, Germany and the United States circulated a draft UN Security Council resolution that would replace UN Security Council Resolution 1244, endorse Ahtisaari's Settlement and end the UN administration after a transition period of 120 days. The U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN said that the European/U.S. draft had enough support in the Security Council to be adopted unless Russia chooses to use its Security Council veto, which Russia has stated at numerous occasions that it might use unless the resolution is acceptable by both sides. \\"UN Resolution on Kosovo Circulated\\", AP, 11 May 2007. Russia rejected a UN Security Council resolution based on the Ahtisaari Plan. As discussions progressed in the week of 16 July, seemingly with little hope of agreement, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana was quoted as saying that the European Union would cease supporting efforts to agree a resolution backing the Ahtisaari plan 'within days' if Russian concerns could not be met. Russia had rejected another draft resolution on Monday 16 July which had called for further talks between Serbia and Kosovo Albanians, describing the draft as 'permeated with the concept of the independence of Kosovo'. British Deputy Head of Mission in New York, Karen Pierce, told reporters on 17 July that a final draft of the resolution would be introduced 'within 36 hours'. According to news service Reuters, Solana had said that a further, four-month period of talks would be conducted under the authority of the Contact Group, though did not discount that a resolution might still be agreed in the coming days. German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared to support renewed talks between the parties after discussions with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica, 'We are now thinking about whether it would be possible to support a phase of negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina to try once again to find a solution,' Merkel was quoted as saying. The United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. The UN Secretary- General later endorsed another time-limited round of negotiations led by a U.S./EU/Russian Troika of negotiators. The Troika completed its work on 10 December 2007, without having achieved an agreement between the parties on Kosovo's status. On 22 January 2008 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution calling for the continuation of talks on the basis of UNSC Resolution 1244.Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

Ahtisaari Plan UN-backed talks on the status of Kosovo, led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, began in February 2006 with the aim of completing them by the end of that year. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both Kosovo and Serbia remain diametrically opposed on the question of status itself. Prime Minister of Kosovo's Provisional Institutions, Agim √áeku stated that his government would accept nothing less than independence and would not contemplate partition. On the part of Serbia, Prime Minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica stated Serbia would give Kosovo full autonomy but could not accept independence. The position of the Contact Group of leading nations is that Kosovo \\"must remain multi-ethnic and the settlement must be acceptable to the people of Kosovo. Additionally, there will be no return of Kosovo to the pre-1999 situation, no partition of Kosovo and no union of Kosovo with any other, or part of another, country.\\" While not yet mentioning the word \\"independence,\\" the draft Settlement included several provisions that were widely interpreted as implying statehood for Kosovo. For example, the draft Settlement would give Kosovo the right to apply for membership in international organizations, create a Kosovo Security Force and adopt national symbols.\\"UN envoy seeks multi-ethnic, self-governing Kosovo \\", Agence France- Presse (AFP), Vienna, 2 February 2007. Ahtisaari said that after a period of consultations with the parties he would finalize his Settlement proposal for submission to the UN Security Council and at that stage he would also elaborate on the status issue itself.\\"Ahtisaari press conference \\", UNOSEK website , New York, 8 February 2007. In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. As of early July 2007 the draft resolution, which is backed by the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council, had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty. The United States called the proposal \\"fair and balanced,\\"Presentation of Kosovo Status Proposal to the Parties , Sean McCormack, U.S. Department of State spokesman, Washington, DC, 2 February 2007. while the EU Presidency noted that Ahtisaari's proposals \\"build on almost twelve months of direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina.\\"EU Presidency Statement on the Kosovo status proposals to be presented today by Martti Ahtisaari in Belgrade and Pristina , 2 February 2007. Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, stated that it will not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina. In Belgrade, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica refused to receive Ahtisaari. Ko≈°tunica claimed that because Serbia had still not formed a new government after the 21 January parliamentary elections he had no mandate to discuss Kosovo and therefore could not meet Ahtisaari. Nevertheless, he later denounced the proposal as \\"illegitimate and unacceptable\\" because he alleged it \\"violates the U.N. Charter ... by undermining the sovereignty of U.N. member Serbia.\\"\\"UN Envoy Presents Kosovo Plan, Serbia Quickly Rejects It \\", by Barry Wood, Voice of America (VOA), Washington, 2 February 2007.\\"Ahtisaari's proposal unacceptable and illegitimate for Serbia\\", Government of the Republic of Serbia website, Belgrade, 7 February 2007.

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Kosovo Albanian leaders reacted by proposing unilateral independence for 28 November 2007, though the UN would be required to overrule any such action. In November 2008, the EU accepted the demand of Serbia not to implement the plan of Ahtisaari through EULEX. Serbian constitutional referendum A referendum on a proposed draft of the new Serbian constitution was held on 28 October and 29 October 2006 and has resulted in the draft constitution being approved by the Serbian electorate. The constitution is Serbia's first as an independent state since the Kingdom of Serbia's 1903 constitution. Over 6.6 million people were entitled to vote in the national referendum. Kosovo did not vote. During the nearly one-century of Serbian rule in Kosovo, this is the only attempt to legally incorporate Kosovo into Serbia, and it was seen by Albanians as an attempt to prejudge the result of the negotiations. In the preamble to the constitution it states that \\"Kosovo is an autonomous province of Serbia with significant autonomy\\". Serbian legal scholars found that this unambiguous statement means it would be unconstitutional for Kosovo to secede from Serbia. Positions of the parties *Serbia's position on the status of Kosovo is that Kosovo should enjoy substantial autonomy, but not be granted independence. Frequently dubbed \\"more than autonomy, less than independence,\\" Belgrade's vision for Kosovo includes expanding autonomy in which Kosovo is largely free to govern itself, although Kosovo would not be permitted an independent role in international relations or defence and would remain nominally within the state of Serbia. The Serbian side has also proposed the One Country Two Systems formula, i.e. the \\"Hong Kong model\\" as a solution, but it was rejected by the Albanian politicians.AP Serbia argues that Kosovo's independence would be a violation of Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and therefore contrary to the UN Charter and principles of international law. Belgrade also asserts the UNMIK has allowed widespread discrimination against Kosovo's Serb minority and has not facilitated the return of about 200,000 of internally displaced persons who fled Kosovo during and immediately after the conflict. Serbia insists that UNSCR 1244, which envisioned an UN-facilitated political process to determine status, precludes independence through a preambular reference to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Serbia). Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica has said that '...any imposed solution that would seize part of our territory would be a violation of international law.'\\"Serbs accuse UN of violation of law over Kosovo independence \\", by Ewen MacAskill, The Guardian (UK), 25 October 2005. *Kosovo Albanians generally assert that they could not remain within a Serbian state citing the repression by the Milo≈°eviƒá government in the 1990s.Negotiations on status of Kosovo still under way \\", by Blerta Foniqi- Kabashi, Southeast European Times, Pristina, 15 December 2006.

These principles notably included the requirement that there be no return to the situation prior to 1999 and that there be no change in Kosovo's borders (i.e., no partition of Kosovo) and no union of Kosovo with any neighbouring state.\\"No breakthrough at Kosovo talks \\", BBC News, 24 July 2006. The same statement includes a call for all parties to refrain from unilateral steps and reject any form of violence. The Contact Group affirms that the final decision on the status of Kosovo should be endorsed by the UN Security Council. At a January 2006 meeting of foreign ministers, the Contact Group further declared that a settlement \\"needs, inter alia, to be acceptable to the people of Kosovo\\" and emphasized the need for the settlement to address the concerns of Kosovo's ethnic minorities.\\"Statement by the Contact Group on the Future of Kosovo \\", Washington, DC, 31 January 2006. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in September 2006 that the world must apply the same standards to the separatist Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as it does to the Serbian province of Kosovo, where many are seeking independence. He also added that Russia would not endorse any UN Security Council resolution which it felt compromised these rights.Putin says world should regard Kosovo, separatist Georgian regions on equal footing, Associated Press, 13 September 2006.Ko≈°tunica talks to Putin B92. 15 January 2007. *A NATO report on the question of Kosovo's status states that a region may have the right of secession in the case of foreign occupation or if the region is a colony of another nation. The NATO report claims, while mentioning disagreement on the interpretation, that a third condition exists when \\"a people whose right to internal self-determination has been thoroughly violated by a Government that does not represent the people\\" and suggests Kosovo qualifies under this condition. It concludes, while there is a case in favor of a right to secession for Kosovo, it rejects the right to secession in cases where regions are open to democratic mechanisms. Declaration of independence Map of the Republic of Kosovo, as proclaimed in 2008 Despite official UN and Russian disapproval, the US, UK, and France appeared likely to recognize Kosovar independence if it had been declared on 28 November 2007 or on 10 December 2007, the deadline for an agreement between Kosovo and Serbia set by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. In February 2008, Hashim Tha√ßi said that about 100 countries were ready to immediately recognise Kosovo's independence after declaration. On 17 February 2008, Kosovo declared independence. The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Serbia deemed this act illegal arguing it was not in coordination with the UN Charter, the Constitution of Serbia, the Helsinki Final Act, UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (including the previous resolutions) and the Badinter Commission. On 18 February 2008, the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia declared Kosovo's declaration of independence as null and void per the suggestion of the Government of the Republic of Serbia. The Constitution of Kosovo was proclaimed on 15 June 2008, and immediately denounced as illegal by Serbia. International Court of Justice review On 27 March 2008 Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremiƒá said Serbia would request the International Court of Justice to review the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence. On 8 October 2008 the UN General Assembly adopted Serbia's resolution requesting the International Court of Justice to assess the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The United Nations General Assembly adopted this proposal on 8 October 2008 with 77 votes in favor, 6 votes against and 74 abstentions. On 22 July 2010 the court ruled that the declaration did not breach international law, because in general international law does not deal with declarations of independence and because in this specific case the declaration was not issued by the Assembly of Kosovo, Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, or any other official body and thus the authors, who named themselves \\"representatives of the people of Kosovo\\" were not bound by the Constitutional Framework (promulgated by United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)) or by UNSCR1244 that is addressed only to United Nations Member States and organs of the United Nations. Prior to the announcement Hashim Tha√ßi said there would be no \\"winners or losers\\" and that \\"I expect this to be a correct decision, according to the will of Kosovo's citizens. Kosovo will respect the advisory opinion.\\" For his part, Serbia's President, Boris Tadiƒá, warned that \\"If the International Court of Justice sets a new principle, it would trigger a process that would create several new countries and destabilise numerous regions in the world.\\" Belgrade‚ÄìPristina negotiations Brussels Agreement (2013) After six months of negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo, led by the European Union a deal was reached on 19 April 2013. In exchange for limited autonomous powers for the Serb north, Serbia agreed not to block Kosovo's path to eventual membership of the EU.

This type of floral mechanism is thought to encourage outcross pollen transfer and is usually associated with heteromorphic self-incompatibility to reduce inbreeding. It is an example of heterostyly and reciprocal herkogamy, like distyly, which is the more common form of heterostyly. Darwin first described tristylous species in 1877 in terms of the incompatibility of these three morphs.  Description  Model of style and stamen morphology in tristylous species, Eichhornia paniculata with associated allelic combination. The three floral morphs of tristylous plants are based on the positioning of the male and female reproductive structures, as either long-, mid-, or short- styled morphs. Often this is shortened to L, M and S morphs. There are two different lengths of stamens in each flower morph that oppose the length of the style. For example, in the short-styled morph, the two sets of stamen are arranged in the mid and long position in order to prevent autogamy. In trimorphic incompatibility system, full seed set is accomplished only with pollination of stigmas by pollen from anthers of the same height. This incompatibility system produces pollen and styles with three different incompatibility phenotypes because of the three style and stamen lengths. Tristylous species have been found in several angiosperm families including the Oxalidaceae, Pontederiaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Connaraceae, Linaceae and Lythraceae, though several others have been proposed. There is not a consistent consensus on the specific criteria defining tristyly. In a 1993 review of tristylous evolutionary biology, Barrett proposes three common features for tristylous plants, 1) three floral morphs with differing style and stamen height, 2) a trimorphic incompatibility system, and 3) additional polymorphisms of the stigmas and pollen.  Heteromorphic Incompatibility System  This incompatibility system is a specific mechanism employed by heterostylous species, where incompatibility is based on the positioning of the reproductive structure of the flower. In tristylous species this is based on two loci, S and M with one allele dominant at each loci. For the short- styled morph the dominant allele is in the S locus (Ssmm or SsMm), whereas in the mid-styled morph the dominant allele is at the M locus (ssMm). The S locus is epistatic to the M locus such that the presence of the S allele produces a short-styled flower regardless of the genotype at the M locus. The long-styled morph, on the other hand, is homozygous recessive for both loci (ssmm). In tristylous species, incompatibility varies, with some species showing varying degrees of compatibility outside of the reciprocal herkogamy pattern of pollination. Darwin noted weak incompatibility commonly occurring in the M-morph of Lythrum salicaria. Some species have shown weak or absent incompatibility in their mating system, however self-compatibility in tristylous species is still poorly understood. Research on Eichhornia paniculate, found difference in pollen tube growth between intra- and inter- morph pollen, indicating that the incompatibility system is a case of cryptic self-incompatibility.  Evolution  Heterostyly has been found in at least 28 families, while tristyly has only been found in six families. The rarity and complexity of tristyly coupled with its development in a variety of unrelated plant families has made its evolution and adaptive significant hard to discern. It would be assumed that distyly would be the intermediate stage to tristyly but it has also been proposed that that distyly originated from tristyly through the loss of one of the floral morphs. However, there are some distylous families with no tristylous species present, so it is possible that these two polymorphisms evolved separately. The adaption for structural variation in heterostylous species likely developed out of the need for efficient pollen transfer and simultaneous selection to reduce self- fertilization. The mid-morph with stamen positioned below and above the stigma is completely unique to tristylous species. If this positioning occurred in monomorphic species it would promote self-fertilization which could be achieved much more easily without different stamen heights, indicating this positioning in heteromorphic species is meant to encourage cross pollination.

The pilot reported that the water in the ballast tanks had been pumped out in order to make the ship carry more cargo, and that the coal on deck was stowed as high as the bridge. She also had a list to port. In the rough seas she rolled enough to submerge her scuppers and shipped enough water to stop her engines. Unable to make way, the ship turned beam on to the breakers and was engulfed. The United States naval court decided that the vessel was lost through the ordinary perils of the sea but the United Kingdom Board of Trade was not satisfied with this verdict and ordered its own inquiry. Of the crew of twenty four only four were saved.'The Wreck of the Escambia', Liverpool Journal, 2 December 1882. The Wreck Commissioner reported that the inquiry determined that the Captain was to blame for taking the vessel to sea under that condition having acted simply through lack of judgement. Because the Captain had made every effort to save life after the vessel capsized, the court did not cancel his certificate and he was permitted to return to work. The wreck was the subject of a story called \\"Without Ballast\\" in a book entitled Stories Worth Re-reading, first published in 1919.

Polanski shot this short film just after graduating from The National Film School in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1959; it was made in France and was Polanski's last film before the international breakthrough of his 1962 debut feature, Knife in the Water. The Fat and the Lean features the music of Krzysztof Komeda, who composed the scores for all but one of the director's films between Two Men and a Wardrobe (1958) and Rosemary's Baby (1968). In The Fat and the Lean, Polanski plays a barefoot slave playing a flute and beating a drum to entertain his master who rocks in a rocking chair in front of his mansion in the countryside overlooking Paris. The slave wipes his master's brow, feeds him, washes his feet, shades him from the sun with an umbrella, and holds a urinal for him, all the while longing to escape to Paris, which we can see in the distance. A humorous psychological game between the master and the slave transpires whereby the master attempts to prevent the slave from escaping to Paris. The inspiration for the film appears to be the master-slave relationship between Pozzo and Lucky in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot. Indeed, as with many of Polanski's early short films, the influence of Beckett and the Theater of the Absurd is very strong. The Fat and the Lean has been interpreted as allegorical work expressing Polanski's youthful desire to flee the repressive communist regime in postwar Poland and escape to the West. Portions of the film were featured in Marina Zenovich's controversial 2008 documentary, Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired. In the context of the documentary, the situation depicted in The Fat in the Lean seems a bitterly ironic commentary on Polanski's legal troubles during 1977 ‚Äî almost fifteen years after he had left Poland and was living and working in Los Angeles as a successful Hollywood director. The slave tries to flee to Paris; the master gives the slave a goat in order to persuade him to stay. But the goat is chained to the slave's ankle, and becomes so inconvenient that the slave tries to flee once more. The master frees the goat and unfastens the chain, and the slave is so overjoyed that he remains to serve the master with renewed vigor and enthusiasm. If there is an allegory here it might be about human nature and subjugation.

History Formation and early history Formed in 1859 as The Hallamshire Volunteer Rifle Corps with its headquarters at Sheffield. The title Hallamshire came from the ancient lordship of West Riding that comprised the parishes of Sheffield, Ecclesfield and Bradfield. In 1862 the Hallamshire Rifles were presented with Colours. In 1881 with the reorganisation of the British Army, during the Cardwell Reforms, the unit became a volunteer battalion for the York and Lancaster Regiment and was renamed the 1st (Hallamshire) Volunteer Battalion. Second Boer War The Hallamshires (in common with other Volunteer units) raised a second \\"active service\\" battalion. They were awarded the battle honour South Africa 1900-1902. In 1908 they were redesignated as the 4th (Territorial) Battalion. A year later it regained its title becoming 4th (Hallamshire) Battalion. First World War 1/4th (Hallamshire) Battalion Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, most men of the battalion volunteered for Imperial Service (as, due to the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, members of the Territorial Force were not liable for overseas service without their consent), with the men who, for various reasons, were unwilling or unable being posted to the 2/4th Battalion, with the original Hallamshire Battalion being redesignated the 1/4th Battalion. After months of training, in April 1915 the battalion was moved to the Western Front, where it remained for the rest of the war. The battalion was still part of the 3rd West Riding Brigade of the West Riding Division, which in May became the 148th (3rd West Riding) Brigade and 49th (West Riding) Division, respectively, and was sent to the Ypres Salient by June. Over the next six months the battalion lost 94 officers and men killed and 401 injured in the attritional war of the trenches. After a period of rest in Calais they moved to the Somme. On the first day of the Battle of the Somme, 1 July 1916, the battalion was part of the follow-up assault wave. During the next three months of the campaign the Hallamshires lost 27 officers and 750 soldiers killed and wounded. During the rest of the war the Hallamshires suffered many more casualties including 288 in the first use of Mustard Gas at Nieuwpoort in July 1917. In the final Allied Advance to Victory, more commonly known as the Hundred Days Offensive, the Hallamshires were ordered on 13 October to reach the line of the river Selle which was supposedly undefended on the western bank. They advanced across open ground without artillery support to find strongly defended enemy positions. They achieved their objective but with only 4 officers and 240 men present of the 20 officers and 600 men who had started the advance. The war came to an end just under a month later, due to the Armistice with Germany. 2/4th (Hallamshire) Battalion The 2/4th (Hallamshire) Battalion was formed at Sheffield on 21 September 1914, composed mainly of officers and men who, for various reasons, had chosen not to volunteer for Imperial Service. In March 1915 the battalion became part of the 187th (2/3rd West Riding) Brigade of the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division. The battalion's initial role was to supply drafts of replacements to the 1/4th Battalion, which it did throughout most of 1915 and 1916. However, the introduction of conscription in early 1916 saw the battalion mobilised as an active service unit, and, after training, the battalion was sent to the Western Front in January 1917, landing at the French port of Le Havre soon after. 3/4th (Hallamshire) Battalion The 3/4th (Hallamshire) Battalion was formed in March 1915, with the same initial role of the 2/4th Battalion, of supplying drafts of replacements to the 1/4th and 2/4th Battalions, and moved to Clipstone, Nottinghamshire. In April 1916 the battalion was redesignated as the 4th Reserve Battalion and in September absorbed the 5th Reserve Battalion as part of the West Riding Reserve Brigade. In October 1917 the battalion moved to Rugeley, Staffordshire, later Woodbridge, Suffolk and finally Southend-on-Sea, Essex, where they were when the war ended. Between the wars All three battalions were disbanded after the war in 1919. In 1920 the Territorial Force was disbanded and in 1920 was reformed as the Territorial Army (TA) and the original Hallamshire Battalion was, in 1924, the number was dropped by order of King George V in recognition of their war service and the battalion was known as simply The Hallamshire Battalion, Yorks and Lancs. Second World War Hallamshire Battalion The Hallamshire Battalion saw action in the Second World War, and would serve with the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division throughout the war, as it had in First World War. The battalion and most of the division first saw action as part of the ill-fated Norwegian Campaign in April 1940. The battalion arrived with most of the 146th Infantry Brigade, although they were poorly-trained and equipped for the task being assigned to them. They were ashore for twelve days, seeing limited action and losing their only casualties on the journey home when one of their transports was sunk. 6-pounder anti-tank gun, Holland, November 1944. The battalion spent the next two years \\"defending\\" Iceland and training as Alpine troops before returning to Scotland for garrison duties and to prepare for the invasion of North West Europe. The Hallamshires landed in France on D+3, 9 June 1944, three days after the initial invasion on D-Day, and moved into the front line four days later. Twelve days after landing the Hallamshires were involved in the attack on Fontenay-le-Pesnel (Operation Martlet) against the 26th Panzer Grenadier Regiment. The attack was successful but at the expense of 123 members of the battalion killed or wounded. To this day, former members of the battalion at that time still celebrate the victory as the Fontenay Club. Men of the Hallamshire Battalion with civilians, Holland, April 1945. The battalion was involved in the capture of the docks at Le Havre before the Germans could destroy the vital installations. Here they captured 1,005 prisoners, three Dornier flying boats and a submarine. In September, the Hallamshires crossed the Antwerp-Turnhout canal and for his part in a subsequent action, Corporal John William Harper was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his heroism. During the winter months, the battalion served in the Nijmegen salient and participated in the liberation of Arnhem in April 1945, their final action of the war. Eleven months had seen the battalion suffer 158 officers and other ranks killed and 689 wounded or missing. 6th Battalion The 6th Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment was formed as a second-line TA duplicate of the Hallamshire Battalion in August 1939, containing a number of former members of the original Hallamshires, although the 6th Battalion did not include the 'Hallamshire' in its title. The battalion was created upon the doubling of the TA in March 1939 due to the increasing possibility of war with Germany. The battalion was part of the 138th Infantry Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division and, upon the declaration of war in September 1939, spent much of its early existence in England guarding vulnerable points. In April 1940 the battalion went to France, and the following month experienced heavy fighting in the St Omer-La Bass√©e area. Taking part in the Dunkirk evacuation, the battalion returned to England in June 1940 and remained there on anti-invasion duties for the next two-and-a- half years. In early 1943 the battalion, now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Kendrew, together with the rest of the 46th Division, was sent to French North Africa where it became part of the British First Army and fought in the Tunisian Campaign, notable in the final stages of the Battle of Kasserine Pass in late February, until the campaign ended in mid-May, with the battalion capturing thousands of Axis soldiers. After spending three months resting, refitting and training, the battalion then, in early September 1943, took part in the Allied invasion of Italy, suffering very heavy casualties. The battalion, after helping in the liberation of Naples, later participated in the breaching the Volturno Line, and advanced up the spine of western Italy, fighting along the Bernhardt and Winter Lines, and in the First Battle of Monte Cassino in January 1944. In March 1944, the battalion, after nearly six months of continuous action, was withdrawn to Egypt and later Palestine to rest and refit, after suffering very heavy losses. Returning to Italy in July the battalion fought on the Gothic Line, before, in December 1944, being sent to Greece and returning again to Italy in April 1945. However, the battalion took no part in Operation Grapeshot, the final offensive of the Italian Campaign, and instead moved into Austria for occupation duties in May. Postwar The Hallamshire Battalion remained in Germany after the war, returning home in 1946, when, after merging with the 6th Battalion, it was disbanded, only to be reformed in 1947. In 1950 the battalion was converted into a motorised infantry role. The 6th Battalion was sent to Austria after the war, where it remained until 1946 before returning to the United Kingdom the same year where it merged with the original Hallamshire Battalion.

Early development While public markets were common in many U.S. cities, more markets operated in New Orleans, Louisiana for much longer than the rest of the nation‚Äôs cities. The French and later the Spanish colonial governments followed these European practices in New Orleans. Under the French, market activity began on the levee, where ships would dock at the riverbank and sell produce, meat, and other provisions in the open-air. In 1779, soon after the Spaniards assumed control of New Orleans, they constructed the city‚Äôs first market building (the French Market), thus putting an end to the practice of the levee-street corner markets. While protecting consumers from high prices and poor quality food, the establishment of the French Market also provided the Spanish government with increased control over local commerce. From this, a network of municipal public markets was born. It survived numerous administrations: Spanish, American, Confederate, and lastly American. It thrived throughout the nineteenth and into the twentieth century. By the First World War, there were thirty-two markets scattered throughout the city, with at least one in every neighborhood. Market culture With names like Memory, Suburban, Le Breton, Lautenschlaeger, Prytania, and Trem√©, the markets not only served as economic engines in their neighborhoods, but also reflected the cultural dynamics of the neighborhoods and the metropolitan area. At the end of the nineteenth century, immigration through the port of New Orleans matched that of New York and San Francisco in sheer numbers and diversity. For many immigrants, the public market provided them with an entry point into the economy as small-scale entrepreneurs. Many of the city‚Äôs corner groceries and food processors began as stalls at the public markets. Shoppers would have to be prepared to conduct business in many languages. The prevailing languages were French, Creole Patois, various African languages, English, Spanish, German, Gaelic, Choctaw, Greek, Maltese, and Italian. Stall rents were low and shoppers were plentiful. Cheesemongers, fishmongers, butchers, and greengrocers provided New Orleans shoppers with basic necessities ‚Äì calas tout chauds (fried cakes), pralines, estomac mul√¢tre (gingerbread), fil√© powder (for gumbo), and po' boy sandwiches. Sicilian truck farmers from St. Bernard Parish carted in crops like creole artichokes, tomatoes, garlic, and fava beans. Hunters would bring in everything from raccoons, bears, and possums to songbirds. Coastal fishermen ‚Äì many originally from the Canary Islands, China, and Croatia ‚Äì would market oysters, shrimp, crawfish, and a wide selection of fish. Painter John James Audubon noted in his journal his surprise at finding ‚Äúa Barred Owl, cleaned and exposed, for sale at twenty-five cents.‚Äù Over time, the spin-off businesses from the markets began to circulate throughout the city. For residents who could not get to market, they could purchase yard fresh eggs, strawberries, milk, and prepared foods like fried oysters right from their doorsteps. Roving street vendors would make regular rounds through neighborhoods, singing songs announcing their products, while others offered services, like scissors grinding, chimney sweeping, and tin smithery. Recent history After the Second World War, the City of New Orleans began to privatize many of the older public markets, which had begun to fall into disrepair during the Great Depression. The Works Progress Administration era of the 1930s was a time of growth for public markets, with many new ones constructed during this period. However, with significant demographic shifts to the suburbs, the neighborhood markets lost their customers and then their vendors. Throughout the city, scattered remnants of the public market system remain. Some have been transformed into commercial businesses, while others remain vacant or were torn down. The nation‚Äôs oldest continuously running public market ‚Äì The French Market ‚Äì remains open for business. In the heart of the Vieux Carr√©, it continues to draw large crowds to its weekend flea market, restaurants, and world-famous coffee stand ‚Äî Caf√© du Monde. Prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the St. Roch Fish Market continued to serve gumbo. Crescent City Farmers Market During the decade from 1995 to 2005, there was a resurgence of public markets in New Orleans. The Crescent City Farmers Market was established through a \\"community-wide collaboration between Loyola University, the City of New Orleans, the William B. Reily Company and a host of citizens,\\" and grew from one day of operation a week in one neighborhood to operating in four neighborhoods: the Warehouse District, Uptown Square, Mid City, and the French Quarter. \\\\- Crescent City Farmers Market website and kicked off traveling seafood markets called White Boot Brigades in 2004, which brought commercial shrimpers into neighborhoods craving fresh foods. In the wake of the success of the open-air farmers market model, neighborhood associations and enterprising neighborhood activists developed art markets in Bywater and Mid City, which marketumbrella.org added to with its Festivus (held every December on first 3 Sundays), which brought a sense of fun to the urban holiday shopping experience (along with fair trade, recycled and artisanal goods). In 2006, with the city and region desperately attempting to rebuild after the wreckage and disruptions from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, two of the Crescent City Farmers Markets reopened and started providing the city with local, fresh food, artisanal goods as well as a warm, friendly town square. Across the river from New Orleans, the Gretna Farmers Market opened in October 2006 with an open-air farmers market in its historic courthouse plaza.

The soldier, vehicle, or unit on point is frequently the first to take hostile fire. The inherent risks of taking point create a need for constant and extreme operational alertness. However, ambushes often intend to let the point element past the prime kill zone in order to be maximally effective. Point position is often rotated periodically so as not to overtax the individual soldier/unit. History Origins The term might be related to the Middle English phrase \\"in point\\", which meant \\"in immediate danger or peril\\". The modern use of the term derives from military tactics. During a military patrol or infantry operation, the point man is a navigator who walks several meters out in front of everyone else and is likely to be the first one to encounter enemy soldiers. It is a hazardous position that requires alertness and ability to deal with unexpected attacks. The term was used in the 19th century American Old West when the lead cowboy at the front of a herd of cattle was known as the pointer or point man. It may have come into common use because many of the cowboys in the late 1800s were veterans of the American Civil War. In cavalry terminology, the men scouting ahead of the main force were said to be \\"riding point\\". This use was first recorded in 1903. The concept seems to have been introduced to the American military at West Point by Professor Dennis H. Mahan, who taught most of the top officers on both sides in the Civil War. In his Elementary Treatise on Advanced-Guard, Out-Post and Detachment Service of Troops (1861), he discussed the use of the column or V-shaped advance guard by the Greeks and Romans: In the section on Advanced Guards and Advanced Posts, Professor Mahan introduced the definition of the point man to the future American generals: Modern use \\"Take point\\" came into common use during World War II by American ground forces; its use continued through the Korean War, Vietnam War and Iraq War. This idiom, \\"take point\\" has entered the vernacular in many ways. \\"Taking point\\" is often used in describing pathfinding behaviors in non-military situations, or simply to mean \\"lead the challenge\\", often in a business context.\\"to walk point\\" English to Dutch Marketing/Market Research idioms; In some cases it has replaced the idiom \\"stalking horse\\". More recently (possibly originating from the late 1960s), the term has been extended to describe someone at the forefront of an issue. It can be used to refer to both the defender or the attacker of the position or idea. This use is most often used in a political context, as the point man is usually in the public eye. In recent American youth (especially hip hop) culture, the idiom \\"on point\\" refers either to someone who possesses abundant and various qualities of competence, leadership or style, or to specific acts which demonstrate such qualities.Urban Wear: Hip-Hop Culture as Identity by Lashaunta Santos at MIT's Cultureshock group weblogInterview with DominantG on UKHH.com Especially profound lyrics, a particular musical performance or a philosophical position might be referred to as \\"on point.\\" This varies somewhat from the traditional meaning of the phrase, \\"directly applicable or dispositive of the matter under consideration.\\"On Point definition at Answers.com Other uses * In (American) politics, a point man is someone leading the defense of a political position. * In the commission of crime, usually a robbery, a \\"point man\\" is a lookout. * Gun dogs and hunting dogs, such as the pointing breed, \\"makes/comes to a point\\" by standing rigid and facing the game. * In ice hockey the point man is the defense man on the blue line of the offensive position in the \\"attacking zone\\", meaning that he is usually farther from the net than any other skater (almost the exact opposite of what point man means in the military); in basketball the point guard directs the team's offense in the front court. * In ballet, the term en pointe refers to the act of standing on the points of the toes while performing steps References External links * Random House Word of the Day Entry on point man * Elementary Treatise on Advanced-Guard, Out-Post and Detachment Service of Troops (1861) * Walking Point: The energetic journey of Edwin Kieffer, by Jeff Brodsky in August 9, 2006 Mountain Xpress (accessed Sept. 23, 2006) Category:Maneuver tactics Category:Military terminology Category:Surveillance Category:Political science terminology ","title":"Take point"},{"id":"7096228","text":"Barbara S.

It is housed in an 1868 building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, located in Rochester at 75 Woodbury Boulevard. The Center has full seasons of programming, in addition to discussions based on plays and staged readings, and community outreach. Theatre Executives Mark Cuddy- Artistic Director Christopher Mannelli- Executive Director The Company In 1972, William Markham Selden and Cynthia Mason Selden, a British actress, residents of nearby Avon, co-founded GeVa, an abbreviation for \\"Genesee Valley Arts Foundation\\" and its associated theatre company. The company's first shows were short dramas produced at lunchtime in 1973 at the Rochester Business Institute (RBI). Programming expanded to full- length plays and it became a regional theatre company ranked with similar companies, including those of Buffalo and Syracuse. In 1997, the name of the company was changed to Geva Theatre Center, dropping the CamelCase formatting. In 2011, Geva Theatre Center hosted the 2011 American Association of Community Theatre Festival. By 2017, it was recognized as the best-attended theatre in New York State outside of New York City.Blog of the New York State Council on the Arts, November 22, 2017 (accessed 29 September 2018). Actors appearing at GeVa in the early years included Samuel L. Jackson (in A Raisin in the Sun), Scott Bakula, and Georgia Engel. Others who have graced the Geva stage include Kathy Bates, Josh Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Bill Pullman, Anna Deavere Smith, Robert Vaughn, and Anthony Zerbe. Among Geva's contributors are Academy Award nominees, Tony Award winners and nominees, Drama Desk Award winners and nominees, Emmy Award winners and nominees, and a Pulitzer Prize nominee. As of 2018, Geva had presented more than 400 stage productions, as well as other events. World Premieres: Five Course Love by Gregg Coffin (2004); Splitting Infinity by Jamie Pachino (2006); Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, adapted by Mark Cuddy and Marge Betley (2008); The House in Hydesville by Dan O'Brien (2009); A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, adapted by Mark Cuddy, original music & lyrics by Gregg Coffin (2010); Voices of the Spirits in My Soul by Nora Cole (2012); The Book Club Play by Karen Zacarias (2013); All Your Questions Answered by Greg Kotis (2013); Tinker to Evers to Chance by Mat Smart (2014); Informed Consent by Deborah Zoe Laufer (2014); Katherine's Colored Lieutenant by Nora Cole (2014); The Road to Where by Cass Morgan (2015); Women in Jeopardy by Wendy MacLeod (2015); Other Than Honorable by Jamie Pachino (2017); The Agitators by Mat Smart (2017); Heartland by Gabriel Jason Dean (2018); Hard Cell by Brent Askari (2019). The Building Geva was originally housed in a building located at 168 South Clinton Avenue, then the Rochester Business Institute building,Website of Geva Theatre Center (accessed 29 September 2018). but by 1982, its expansion to a \\"full-fledged company\\" meant that it needed an improved facility. Toward that end, it purchased a former armory and convention hall at 75 Woodbury Boulevard, diagonally across the street from the RBI building. The newly-acquired building had been designed in 1868 by Rochester Architect Andrew J. Warner and was first occupied by the 54th Regiment of the New York State Militia. In 1907, additions and renovations were made and the building became known as the Convention Hall. As such, it hosted such notable political figures as William Jennings Bryan, William Howard Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It was also a cultural center for Rochester, with appearances by world renowned artists such as Anna Pavlova, Enrico Caruso, Fritz Kreisler, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Gustav Mahler, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Arturo Toscanini. Other events included wrestling and boxing matches, flower shows, and dog shows. The building was used as a hospital during the 1918 flu epidemic and as a tonsil clinic in 1930. In 1949, the building became the Naval Reserve Center and by 1975 it housed offices for several departments of the City of Rochester. After buying the building from the city in 1982, Geva began three years of renovations and the building re-opened as a theatre on 29 March 1985. The new theatre's first production was Planet Fires, a drama by Thomas Babe, a Rochester playwright. Featuring a newly freed black man and a Union deserter who have traveled North together, the play was set soon after the Civil War at a campground near Rochester. Mel Gussow, \\"THE STAGE: 'PLANET FIRES,' AT GEVA IN ROCHESTER\\", New York Times, 14 April 1985, accessed 27 February 2014. On 26 November 1985, the new facility was dedicated as the Richard Pine Theatre, in honor of a local developer who had arranged the financing that made Geva's move possible.\\"GeVa names its building for local man,\\" Democrat and Chronicle (Rochester, New York), 25 November 1985, page 15. In 1997, Geva undertook a major development campaign that included construction of a second stage in the building. The 180-seat Nextstage, subsequently known as the Ron & Donna Fielding Stage, opened in 2000. It is intended for smaller-scale, more intimate productions, theatre for young audiences, and development of new plays. The original, larger theatre space was then called the Mainstage and later the Elaine P. Wilson Stage. The 522-seat Wilson Stage is used for a wide variety of performances, including American and world classics, new plays, and musicals. In 2016, Geva completed a seven-year project that included exterior rehabilitation and interior infrastructure work as well as renovations to rehearsal and conference rooms, administrative offices, green rooms, dressing rooms, and the lobby and caf√© areas. In addition, a new entertainment suite was created, new seats and carpeting were installed in the Wilson Stage, and new flooring was added in the Fielding Stage.Geva Theatre Center.

Credico (born 1954)https://heavy.com/news/2017/11/randy-credico- roger-stone-julian-assange-wikileaks/amp/ is an American perennial political candidate, comedian, radio host, and activist, and the former director of the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice. Entertainment career Credico was formerly active on the comedy circuit, and at the age of 27 made an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. During a later appearance he compared Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick to Eva Braun; he was never invited on the show again. Credico was featured on the comedy album, Strange Bedfellows: Comedy and Politics (1988) along with Jimmy Tingle, Barry Crimmins, and Will Durst. Credico spent four years in Tulia, Texas, bringing national attention to a racially charged mass drug arrest. The Kunstler Fund produced an award-winning documentary on the subject entitled Tulia, Texas: Scenes from the drug war, written, directed and edited by Emily Kunstler and Sarah Kunstler, the daughters of famed attorney William Kunstler. Credico is the subject of the film Sixty Spins Around the Sun, directed by comedian Laura Kightlinger. Credico produced, directed and wrote the radio program 60 Mimics, and is a frequent guest on Live from the State Capitol with Fred Dicker, a political talk radio program on WGDJ in Albany, New York. Political activism At age 37, Credico began a periodic campaign against New York state's Rockefeller drug laws, which he claimed were too harsh, disproportionately affecting the poor and minorities. Small changes softening the stiffest penalties were passed in the state legislature, which Credico thought were insufficient. In 2010, Credico attended a meeting of the New York State Senate on Open Government dressed as the Greek philosopher Diogenes the Cynic, \\"seeking an honest politician.\\" In the early 2010s, Credico became a perennial candidate for political office. Credico's most significant appearance in the 2016 election cycle was headlining a Republican fund-raiser in Cayuga County, New York. 2010 U.S. Senate election Credico ran as a Democratic primary challenger against Senator Chuck Schumer in 2010. Credico submitted petitions in an effort to get onto the Democratic Party primary ballot. The party chairman claimed that Credico only submitted a few pages' worth of petitions to the state, far short of the 15,000 necessary, a charge Credico denied. Credico threatened to throw his support to Republican candidate Carl Paladino in the gubernatorial race. He made the ballot. Credico's campaign was supported by several actors and comedians, including Seinfeld co-creator Larry David, Roseanne Barr, and \\"Professor\\" Irwin Corey. He was nominated by the Libertarian Party of New York and the nascent \\"Anti- Prohibition Party\\" of Kristin \\"Manhattan Madam\\" Davis, though those parties do not have permanent ballot access and were required to petition their way onto the ballot. Credico finished with 25,975 votes (0.6%), in last place among the four candidates; in most jurisdictions, Credico was only given one ballot line despite petitioning for two. Credico sued the New York State Board of Elections under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment over this issue of ballot access. On June 19, 2013, the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York ruled in favor of Credico. The New York State Board of Elections did not appeal this decision. 2013 mayoral election Credico ran for the Democratic nomination for Mayor of New York City in the 2013 election. He received 12,685 votes (2.0%). He also appeared on the ballot in the general election with 14 other candidates, on the Tax Wall Street line, receiving 654 votes (0.1%). 2014 gubernatorial election Credico challenged incumbent Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo in the 2014 Democratic primary. He came in third among three candidates, with 20,760 votes (3.6%). Connection with Roger Stone and WikiLeaks Arranged by Margaret Ratner Kunstler, a mutual friend who is Julian Assange's attorney, Credico hosted Assange on Credico's August 25, 2016, radio show. On August 27, 2016, Credico sent a text message to Roger Stone that \\"Julian Assange has kryptonite on Hillary.\\" Credico also notified Stone of subsequent releases by WikiLeaks of numerous emails stolen from John Podesta and the Hillary Clinton campaign, a publication which initiated on October 7, 2016. In November 2017, Stone told the House Intelligence Committee that Credico was his intermediary with Assange to obtain information on Hillary Clinton. Credico was then subpoenaed to appear before the committee, but asserted his Fifth Amendment right before the interview. The committee released him from appearing. By August 2018, special counsel Mueller had subpoenaed Credico to testify before a grand jury in September 2018. Credico intended to comply with the request. Mother Jones reported that Credico had received text messages from Stone in January 2018 stating that the latter was seeking a presidential pardon for Assange. In January 2019, Stone was arrested by the FBI. His indictment claimed that Credico, referred to as \\"Person 2\\", was not Stone's sole contact with WikiLeaks (\\"Organization 1\\"). It also claimed that Credico was pressured by Stone to \\"stonewall\\" his testimony before Congress, and to \\"do a Frank Pentangeli.\\" Among other statements, Stone told Credico to \\"prepare to die\\", and that he would \\"take that dog away from you.\\" Credico relies on a medical support dog. Credico subsequently testified against Stone during Stone's trial in November 2019.

This is typically done so that the variable can no longer act as a confounder in, for example, in an observational study or experiment. When estimating the effect of explanatory variables on an outcome by regression, controlled-for variables are included as inputs in order to separate their effects from the explanatory variables. A limitation of controlling for variables is that back-door paths to unknown confounders may remain. Counterfactual reasoning mitigates the influence of confounders without this drawback. Experiments Experiments attempt to assess the effect of manipulating one or more independent variables on one or more dependent variables. To ensure the measured effect is not influenced by external factors, other variables must be held constant. The variables made to remain constant during an experiment are referred to as control variables. For example, if an outdoor experiment were to be conducted to compare how different wing designs of a paper airplane (the independent variable) affect how far it can fly (the dependent variable), one would want to ensure that the experiment is conducted at times when the weather is the same, because one would not want weather to affect the experiment. In this case, the control variables may be wind speed, direction and precipitation. If the experiment were conducted when it was sunny with no wind, but the weather changed, one would want to postpone the completion of the experiment until the control variables (the wind and precipitation level) were the same as when the experiment began. In controlled experiments of medical treatment options on humans, researchers randomly assign individuals to a treatment group or control group. This is done to reduce the confounding effect of irrelevant variables that are not being studied, such as the placebo effect. Observational studies In an observational study, researchers have no control over the values of the independent variables, such as who receives the treatment. Instead, they must control for variables using statistics. Observational studies are used when controlled experiments may be unethical or impractical. For instance, if a researcher wished to study the effect of unemployment (the independent variable) on health (the dependent variable), it would be considered unethical by institutional review boards to randomly assign some participants to have jobs and some not to. Instead, the researcher will have to create a sample which includes some employed people and some unemployed people. However, there could be factors that affect both whether someone is employed and how healthy he or she is. Part of any observed association between the independent variable (employment status) and the dependent variable (health) could be due to these outside, spurious factors rather than indicating a true link between them. This can be problematic even in a true random sample. By controlling for the extraneous variables, the researcher can come closer to understanding the true effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. In this context the extraneous variables can be controlled for by using multiple regression. The regression uses as independent variables not only the one or ones whose effects on the dependent variable are being studied, but also any potential confounding variables, thus avoiding omitted variable bias. \\"Confounding variables\\" in this context means other factors that not only influence the dependent variable (the outcome) but also influence the main independent variable. Example A study about whether getting older affects someone's life satisfaction. (Some researchers perceive a \\"u-shape\\": life satisfaction appears to decline first and then rise after middle age.) To identify the control variables needed here, one could ask what other variables determine not only someone's life satisfaction but also their age. Many other variables determine life satisfaction. But no other variable determines how old someone is (as long as they remain alive). (All people keep getting older, at the same rate, no matter what their other characteristics.) So, no control variables are needed here. To determine the needed control variables, it can be useful to construct a directed acyclic graph.

RFID is an identification technology in which information stored in semiconductor chips contained in RFID tags is communicated by means of radio waves to RFID readers. The most simple passive RFID tags do not have batteries or transmitters. They get their energy from the field of the reader. They transfer their information to the reader by modulating the signal that is reflected back to the reader by the tag. Because tags depend on the reader for power their range is limited, typically up to 10 meters or 30 feet for UHF RFID tags. Today, the public uses RFID tags for many applications including electronic toll collection, E-ZPass for example, or the Speedpass which is used as a credit token for the purchase of gasoline. The retail supply chain uses RFID tags to monitor the passage of pallets and cases at loading dock doors. The expectation for the future is for RFID tags to be used for the labelling of items for retail sale. Concerns for individual privacy have been raised because the RFID tags may be read by invisible radio waves without the knowledge of the holder of the tagged item. The privacy- protecting RFID tag, the ‚Äúclipped tag‚Äù has been suggested by IBM. The clipped tag puts the option of privacy protection in the hands of the consumer. After the point of sale, a consumer may tear off a portion of the tag, much like the way in which a ketchup packet is opened. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that still may be read, but only at short range ‚Äì less than a few inches or centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling. The clipped tag was listed among the Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Winners for 2006. Two US patents were issued for this invention in 2007. Other mechanisms designed to protect privacy for RFID item tagging for retail use are the EPCglobal kill command and the RSA blocker tag.  Clipped tag development  The concept of the clipped tag was first introduced in a paper authored by IBM researchers Paul Moskowitz and Guenter Karjoth in 2005, RFID Journal, November 7, 2005. In their paper, presented at the 2005 ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society, the authors suggest that by providing the consumer with a means to shorten the antenna, the read range of the tag may be reduced from many meters to just a few centimeters. Several mechanisms were suggested. The mechanisms included perforating the tag like a sheet of postage stamps to allow the tearing off of a portion of the antenna. Another proposed mechanism was to manufacture the tag antenna with exposed conducting lines which could be scratched off by the consumer. IBM teamed up with Marnlen RFiD, a manufacturer of RFID labels, and Printronix, a maker of RFID printers, to demonstrate prototypes of the Clipped Tag, Wired News, May 1, 2006. The tag took the form of a garment hang tag with v-shaped notches in the edges and perforations to direct the tearing of the tag. Reactions by RFID privacy experts were favorable to the invention.

A leading figure in the nineteenth and early twentieth-century revival of painting in tempera, Southall was the leader of the Birmingham Group of Artist-Craftsmen--one of the last outposts of Romanticism in the visual arts, and an important link between the later Pre-Raphaelites and the turn of the century Slade Symbolists. A lifelong Quaker, Southall was an active socialist and pacifist, initially as a radical member of the Liberal Party and later of the Independent Labour Party. Southall was elected an Associate of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA) in 1898 and Member in 1902. He became President of the Society in 1939 and stayed in this post until his death in 1944. Biography Early life Joseph Southall was born to a Quaker family in Nottingham in 1861. His father, a grocer, died a little over a year later, and the young Southall and his mother moved to Edgbaston, Birmingham to live with his mother's family. After an education at Quaker schools including Ackworth School and Bootham School in York, Southall returned to Birmingham in 1878 and was articled as a trainee with the leading local architects' practice Martin & Chamberlain, while studying painting part-time at the Birmingham School of Art. Both institutions were steeped in the spirit of John Ruskin and the Arts and Crafts movement: architect John Henry Chamberlain was a founder and trustee of the Guild of St George, while the Principal of the School of Art, Edward R. Taylor, was a pioneer of Arts and Crafts education and a friend of William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. Southall however was frustrated by his architectural training, feeling that an architect should have a broader understanding of craft disciplines such as painting and carving. With this in mind he undertook several tours in Europe. In 1882 he visited Bayeux, Rouen and Amiens in Northern France. The following year, having left Martin & Chamberlain, he spent thirteen weeks in Italy, visiting Pisa, Florence, Siena, Orvieto, Rome, Bologna, Padua, Venice and Milan. Italy was to have a profound impact. The frescoes of Benozzo Gozzoli were to inspire a deep admiration for the painters of the Italian Renaissance who - before the practice of oil painting spread to Italy from Northern Europe in the sixteenth century - worked largely in egg-based tempera. Forty years later Southall recalled: Southall's decisive moment came while viewing Two Venetian Ladies by Vittore Carpaccio in the Museo Correr in Venice. Ruskin's discussion of the painting in St Marks' Rest‚Äîthe volume that Southall was using as a guide‚Äîincluded Ruskin's remark that \\"I must note in passing that many of the qualities which I have been in the habit of praising in Tintoret and Carpaccio, as consummate achievements in oil-painting are, as I have found lately, either in tempera altogether or tempera with oil above. And I am disposed to think that ultimately tempera will be found the proper material for the greater number of most delightful subjects.\\" On his return to Birmingham Southall conducted his first experiments in tempera painting at the School of Art. Hiatus Initially, however, Southall's discovery of Italian tempera painting had less effect than his studies of Italian architecture. Southall's uncle George Baker - a friend of John Ruskin and Master of Ruskin's Guild of St George - passed some of Southall's Italian sketches on to Ruskin himself, who remarked that \\"he had never seen architecture better drawn\\". Ruskin was so impressed by Southall's architectural understanding that in 1885 he gave him his first major commission: to design a museum for the Guild of St George to stand on his uncle's land near Bewdley, Worcestershire. Southall made a second trip to Italy in 1886 to research this commission, but the project was abandoned when Ruskin revived his original plans to build a museum in Sheffield. Southall later recalled \\"my chance as an architect vanished and years of obscurity with not a little bitterness of soul followed\\". Tempera revival Beauty Seeing the Image of her Home in the Fountain (1898), tempera on wood panelSouthall's experiments with tempera were also taxing throughout the late 1880s, and for a while he returned to oils. A third visit to Italy in 1890 re ignited his enthusiasm, however, and from 1893 his increasingly successful works in tempera received the wholehearted support of Edward Burne-Jones, who expressed particular admiration for Beauty Seeing the Image of her Home in the Fountain and personally submitted Southall's work for exhibition alongside his own. By the late 1890s Southall's experiments had established a method of painting that, while not identical to those documented by Italian sources such as Cennino Cennini, was practical, viable and a genuine tempera method. Although he was not the first Victorian artist to experiment with tempera (John Roddam Spencer Stanhope had exhibited a tempera painting in 1880) he was acknowledged as one of the leaders of its revival, exhibiting with the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, the Royal Academy and the Paris Salon. In 1901 he was prominent among the artists who exhibited at the Modern Paintings in Tempera exhibition at Leighton House Museum and six months later was one of the founder members of the Society of Painters in Tempera, writing the first of the society's technical papers on Grounds suitable for painting in Tempera. Although Southall was never on the staff of the Birmingham School of Art, he maintained close friendships with the core of staff and pupils at the school who would later be identified as the Birmingham Group of Artist-Craftsmen - introducing artists such as Henry Payne, Maxwell Armfield and Arthur Gaskin (a lifelong friend) to his methods during technical demonstrations at his studio in Edgbaston. Edwardian heyday Contentment (1928), watercolor on vellum nailed to a linen-covered stretcher The years before the outbreak of World War I saw Southall at the height of his achievement and fame. He worked on a series of large tempera paintings on mythological subjects that were widely exhibited across Europe and the United States. These could take up to two years to complete but were to establish his reputation critically. Southall's entry in the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists members' register; in his own hand. Dated 1902, with an initialled postage stamp. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists in 1898 and a full Member in 1902, a member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1903 and of the Art Workers Guild and Union Internationale des Beaux-Arts et des Lettres in 1910. In 1907 he was prominent in the first exhibition dedicated to the work of the Birmingham Group held at the Fine Art Society in London, and in 1910 he was the subject of a one-man exhibition at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris, which was both a critical and a commercial triumph. In 1903 Southall married Anna Elizabeth Baker. The couple had been close companions since their youth and had always intended to marry, but were cousins and had deliberately put off marriage until she was after child-bearing age. World War I and after Southall's output as a painter declined considerably with the outbreak of World War I, as the pacifism inherent in his Quaker faith led him to devote his energies to anti-war campaigning. His main artistic output during this period were anti-war cartoons printed in pamphlets and magazines, which number among his most powerful works. Post-war, with his reputation well established, Southall produced fewer of the epic (and time-consuming) tempera works that made his critical name. Much of his life involved travel: favourite destinations included France, Italy, Fowey in Cornwall and Southwold in Suffolk, and these trips generally resulted in series of landscapes, often in watercolour. Between trips his time was spent painting portraits for wealthy, often Quaker, patrons. He was elected a member of the Royal Watercolour Society and the New English Art Club in 1925, and in 1939 was elected President of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists - a post he held until his death. In 1937 Southall underwent an operation from which he never really recovered. After several years of ill health, during which he doggedly continued to paint, he died of heart failure at his home in Edgbaston in 1944. Work Hortus Inclusus (1898), watercolor on vellumSouthall painted a variety of subjects during his career, including mythological, romantic, and religious subjects, portraits and landscapes. He was known for his mastery of the colour red, the clean and clear light in his works, and for his paintings on the theme of Beauty and the Beast. Southall's choice of medium was heavily informed by his Arts and Crafts belief that the physical act of creation was as important as the act of design. Aesthetically egg tempera provided the luminescence and jewel-like quality that had been so sought after by the Pre- Raphaelites (who never themselves perfected the technique), but it also gave him the opportunity to fashion his own materials by hand. To obtain the egg yolks required he even kept his own chickens. Although Southall also painted in a variety of other laborious media (such as the watercolour on vellum of his work Hortus Inclusus), lack of patronage limited his work in fresco - the medium he personally found most interesting. His best known fresco Corporation Street Birmingham in March 1914 - painted for Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery - was described by William Rothenstein as \\"perhaps the most perfect painted in the last three centuries\\". In common with other Birmingham Group members Southall also practiced a variety of crafts besides painting, including murals, furniture decoration, lacework, book illustration and engravings. Many of his paintings have frames featuring decorative work by his wife or other Birmingham Group figures such as Georgie Gaskin or Charles Gere - such decoration was considered integral to the work of art. Influence and reputation As with many Victorian artists, Southall's critical reputation declined through the twentieth century, as he was seen as an backward-looking English artist rendered anachronistic by the rising tide of French modernism. Roger Fry described him as \\"a little slightly disgruntled and dyspeptic Quaker artist who does incredible tempera sham Quattrocentro modern sentimental things with a terrible kind of meticulous skill\\". With the renewed interest in Victorian art this began to be seen as a misrepresentation. John Russell Taylor, art critic of The Times, described him in 1980 as \\"a natural-born surrealist\\"; writing that \\"there is undoubtedly an authentic strangeness in the way he saw things, which comes out most powerfully in his tempera paintings of contemporary life, but also casts a weird light over many of his watercolours ... we are much more likely to find ourselves thinking of Magritte and Balthus and Chirico than of anyone nearer to this apparently stick-in-the-mud Arts-and-Craftsman.\\" Pablo Picasso is recorded by Osbert Sitwell as being so impressed by a Southall painting when visiting Violet Gordon-Woodhouse in the 1920s that he tried to buy it on the spot for his private collection. Far from being isolated from developments on the continent, Southall's reputation was if anything higher in France than in England, with exhibitions at the Salon de Champs-√âlys√©es and the Salon de Champs-de-Mars from the 1890s onwards, and membership of the Union Internationale des Beaux-Arts et des Lettres in 1910 and the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1925. His most successful exhibition was that at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris - one of the main centres of progressive French art. Political activism Southall's interest in radical politics may have been awakened by his uncle George Baker, whose family had a history of radicalism going back to the seventeenth century. Southall's 1885 sketch of John Bright addressing a Birmingham political meeting might be taken as an early indication of radical interest. Southall politics were strongly influenced by the pacifism of his Quaker faith. His opposition to the tide of jingoism that surrounded the Jameson Raid in 1895 provoked him into political action, and the outbreak of World War I in 1914 caused him to switch his allegiance from the Liberal Party to the anti-war Independent Labour Party, for whose Birmingham branch he served as secretary from 1914 until 1931. Southall's obituary in the Birmingham Post recorded that he was always \\"an enthusiastic supporter of that Socialism or Communism which William Morris expressed in his News from Nowhere\\".

SR 170 is the eastern part of the connection between Naval Station Norfolk and Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek. Route description View east along SR 170 at Meadow Creek Road in Norfolk SR 170 begins at a directional intersection with SR 165, which heads west as Little Creek Road toward Naval Station Norfolk and south as Military Highway. The state highway heads east as a five-lane road with center turn lane through a densely populated area of the northeastern part of Norfolk. At Meadow Creek Road, SR 170 becomes a divided highway and intersects the northern terminus of SR 192 (Azalea Garden Road). The state highway reaches its eastern terminus at US 60 (Shore Drive) adjacent to Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek and the boundary between the cities of Norfolk and Virginia Beach. The roadway continues east as Midway Road onto the amphibious base. History Little Creek Road east of Granby Street (then SR 170, now U.S. Route 460) was added to the state highway system in 1942 as State Route 351, at the same time as the eastern half of Military Highway was added; this route connected the Military Highway bypass with several military installations. By 1947, SR 168 was extended from Newport News over the ferry to Sewell's Point, replacing SR 165 on Admiral Taussig Boulevard (now mostly Interstate 564) and the majority of SR 351, from Taussig Boulevard east to US 60\\\\. The small piece of SR 351 west of Taussig Boulevard became a realigned SR 165; SR 351 was entirely eliminated (and immediately reused at its current location to replace part of former SR 168). SR 168 was realigned to use the newly opened Hampton Roads Bridge‚ÄìTunnel in late 1957, and it took over the former SR 170 through Norfolk to North Carolina. Thus the State Route 170 designation was freed for a renumbering of the former SR 168 in Norfolk, from Hampton Boulevard (SR 337) near the old ferry southeast on Taussig Boulevard and east on Little Creek Road to US 60. In 1979, I-564 replaced most of the Taussig Boulevard piece of SR 170, and the rest became an extension of SR 337; thus SR 170 was truncated to its current length by also removing the SR 165 concurrency.

Pottery typologies and seriations and a host of AMS radiocarbon dates show that the site had a number of occupations over several millennia from circa 3500 BC - AD 500 (DAUM 2001a, 2001b; GARI 2002). This site is very important in Korean and world prehistory because of the many important finds including one of the earliest ditch-enclosed settlements in East Asia, substantial prehistoric dry-fields, a multiple ditch-enclosed residential and production precinct for emerging elites, and the earliest evidence of craft specialization (greenstone or 'jade' ornaments) in prehistoric Korea, well- preserved evidence of other production activities including pottery-making. Several small-scale excavations took place beginning in 1977. Wide-scope, large-scale excavation of Daepyeong and surrounding settlements took place between 1996 and 2000. Environment and geography of Daepyeong Prehistoric Daepyeong incorporates in area formed by the curves of the Nam River in a single area of several small, linked alluvial plains that are semi- circumscribed by steep hills of 100‚Äì1100 metres. In the north, Daepyeong includes Sonam-ni and Eoeun, and in the south Okbang and Sangchon-ni are included. Eoeun and Okbang make up the central area and are partially protected by a natural levee formed by terracing and changes in the flow of the Nam River. Jeulmun Pottery Period (c. 3500-1500 B.C.) Jeulmun pottery sherds are found in light numbers throughout the area, indicating that occupation began at least from the Middle Jeulmun Pottery Period. A settlement with a number of pit-houses dating to the latter part of the Middle Jeulmun was excavated at Sangchon-ni (DAUM 2001b). At the same site charred human skeletal remains were discovered in the corner of a pit-house inside a large vessel apparently used as a burial urn. Additionally, there is evidence of a shallow ditch feature that may represent one of the first ditch-enclosed features in East Asian prehistory. Some carbonized seeds found in association with the pit-houses appear to show that Jeulmun people were engaged in small- scale cultivation (Bale 2001; Crawford and Lee 2003). Early Mumun Pottery Period (c. 1500-850 B.C.) The Daepyeong site and other settlement sites of the Mumun Period that are mentioned in Wikipedia articles. Settlement in the Incipient and Early Mumun Pottery Period I was sparse and concentrated in Eoeun (NRICH 2004:141-142). The same area was the location for a settlement of narrow rectangular pit-houses with plans that are not unlike those of the Huron and Iroquoian longhouses of Southern Ontario, Canada. For example, these pit-houses had a series of 2 - 4 hearths lined down the middle of the structure, indicating that the occupants were likely members of an extended, multi-generational household (Bale and Ko 2006). Several small hamlets and/or farmsteads were dispersed in and around the main Daepyeong settlement at Eoeun in areas such as Sonam-ni, Okbang, and Sangchon-ni. Middle Mumun Pottery Period (c. 850-550 B.C.) Daepyeong became a large central settlement in the Early Middle Mumun (c. 850-700 BC). The focus of the settlement was a large nucleated group of 144 pit-houses in Eoeun. Another nucleated settlement of 115 pit-houses developed in Okbang at about the same time. Archaeological evidence from the Middle Mumun indicates that prominent individuals in Eoeun and Okbang probably competed for dominance in the local area. For example, greenstone production and distribution began in Eoeun and was traded to Okbang and areas outside of Daepyeong. Many ditches and ditch-enclosures appeared in Eoeun and Okbang beginning in the Early Middle Mumun. Perhaps this was due to conflict between Okbang and Eoeun, or the whole of Daepyeong with distant outside settlements. Eventually, 8 substantial ditch-and-palisades were constructed at Okbang. This sub-period sees a pattern in which greenstone artifacts that are made in Eoeun are consumed by those who are buried in the ditch-and-palisade precinct of Okbang. Archaeologists think that the dry- fields recovered in large-scale excavations most likely date to the Early Middle Mumun. Bale and Ko note that more than 32,000 square metres of dry- fields were recovered at Daepyeong in wide-scope, clearing horizontal excavations (Bale and Ko 2006:Table 3). Through detailed and long-term archaeobotanical research, Crawford and Lee of the University of Toronto, Canada discovered the people of Daepyeong had multiple cropping agricultural systems in place even in the Early Mumun (Crawford and Lee 2003). Late Mumun, Protohistoric, and Korean Three Kingdoms (c. 550 BC - AD 668) Daepyeong was an important settlement in the Mumun economic system, but as with many simple chiefdoms, it began to decline and then collapsed. The area was likely depopulated at the end of the Late Middle Mumun, circa 550-500 BC. Sangchon-ni may have had an ephemeral Late Mumun occupation, and settlements such as Naechon-ni (DAUM 2001a) appeared in the Korean Proto-historic (c. 300 BC - AD 300/400). Additionally, dry-fields dating to the early Korean Three Kingdoms period have been excavated in Okbang. The area was a part of the Gaya Confederacy during this period, and was later absorbed into the Silla state. Importance Daepyeong, a large, complex, and economically important settlement with multiple chronological components, is important for those trying to understand the secondary origins of agriculture in East Asia, the development of complex hunter-gatherers, nucleated settlements, intensive agriculture, incipient social ranking, and simple chiefdoms. This site is on the same scale of archaeological importance as Yoshinogari and Sannai-Maruyama in Japan, and Banpo and Jiangzhai of the Early Chinese Neolithic.

However, the name 'iceplant' may also refer to members of the unrelated plant family Aizoaceae. It is native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and has been introduced throughout the tropics. It is now quite common in rural areas of India. Martynia is used for making beads and ornaments, and has a history of folk medicine uses in the Indian subcontinent. Description Hairy stem and branches with immature fruits of Martynia annua Developing Martynia annua and ripened black fruits, showing \\"cat's claw\\" tips Martynia is an erect, somewhat shrubby annual plant about tall, covered with glandular hairs, and has ovate, mucilaginous leaves wide and long. The leaves are opposite, and have red petioles. They resemble sticky rhubarb. Its flowers are pale pink and tubular, and have nectar guides and purple spots. Fruits become blackened when ripe and have hooked spines at the tip, lending its name \\"cat's claw\\" or \\"tiger's claw\\". They stick to animal fur and eventually the seeds fall out as the fruit gets crushed by the animal's feet. Taxonomy The genus and species were first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 publication, Species Plantarum, although the modern taxonomic definition may not correspond with the original Linnaeus description, instead being a synonym for Proboscidea louisianica (Miller) Thellung, as well as other names used in India. Martynia was collected by the Scottish naval surgeon William Houstoun near Veracruz, Mexico. Houstoun sent seeds of this new plant to Philip Miller, chief gardener at the Chelsea Physic Garden, in 1731. Houstoun named the plant, Martynia, in honor of a professor of botany at Cambridge, John Martyn. The plant was described in Martyn's work Historia Plantarum Rariorum, with a full description and illustration. Martyn gave the species the following descriptive name: Martynia annua villosa et viscosa, folio subrotundo, flore magno rubro. In India, it has several taxonomic synonyms and common names. Distribution Martynia is widely naturalized across subtropical and tropical world regions, particularly in Central America and the Indian subcontinent. It is typically found in uncultivated fields and arable lands from plains to . Uses The plant is used for making beads and other native ornaments. It has been applied for numerous supposed treatments in Ayurveda and Siddha folk medicine.

It summarizes the predominant directions of the gradient in a specified neighborhood of a point, and the degree to which those directions are coherent. The structure tensor is often used in image processing and computer vision. J. Bigun and G. Granlund (1986), Optimal Orientation Detection of Linear Symmetry. Tech.

The 2D structure tensor Continuous version For a function I of two variables , the structure tensor is the 2√ó2 matrix : S_w(p) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\int w(r) (I_x(p-r))^2\\\\,d r & \\\\int w(r) I_x(p-r)I_y(p-r)\\\\,d r \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] \\\\int w(r) I_x(p-r)I_y(p-r)\\\\,d r & \\\\int w(r) (I_y(p-r))^2\\\\,d r \\\\end{bmatrix} where I_x and I_y are the partial derivatives of I with respect to x and y; the integrals range over the plane \\\\mathbb{R}^2; and w is some fixed \\"window function\\", a distribution on two variables. Note that the matrix S_w is itself a function of . The formula above can be written also as S_w(p)=\\\\int w(r) S_0(p-r)\\\\,d r, where S_0 is the matrix-valued function defined by : S_0(p)= \\\\begin{bmatrix} (I_x(p))^2 & I_x(p)I_y(p) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] I_x(p)I_y(p) & (I_y(p))^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} If the gradient abla I = (I_x,I_y)^\\\\text{T} of I is viewed as a 2√ó1 (single-column) matrix, where (.)^\\\\text{T} denotes transpose operation, turning a row vector to a column vector, the matrix S_0 can be written as the matrix product ( abla I)( abla I)^\\\\text{T}, also known as an outer product, or tensor product. Note however that the structure tensor S_w(p) cannot be factored in this way in general except if w is a Dirac delta function. Discrete version In image processing and other similar applications, the function I is usually given as a discrete array of samples I[p], where p is a pair of integer indices. The 2D structure tensor at a given pixel is usually taken to be the discrete sum : S_w[p] = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sum_r w[r] (I_x[p-r])^2 & \\\\sum_r w[r] I_x[p-r]I_y[p-r] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] \\\\sum_r w[r] I_x[p-r]I_y[p-r] & \\\\sum_r w[r] (I_y[p-r])^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} Here the summation index r ranges over a finite set of index pairs (the \\"window\\", typically \\\\\\\\{-m..+m\\\\\\\\}\\\\times\\\\\\\\{-m..+m\\\\\\\\} for some m), and w[r] is a fixed \\"window weight\\" that depends on r, such that the sum of all weights is 1. The values I_x[p],I_y[p] are the partial derivatives sampled at pixel p; which, for instance, may be estimated from by I by finite difference formulas. The formula of the structure tensor can be written also as S_w[p]=\\\\sum_r w[r] S_0[p-r], where S_0 is the matrix-valued array such that : S_0[p] = \\\\begin{bmatrix} (I_x[p])^2 & I_x[p]I_y[p] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] I_x[p]I_y[p] & (I_y[p])^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} Interpretation The importance of the 2D structure tensor S_w stems from the fact eigenvalues \\\\lambda_1,\\\\lambda_2 (which can be ordered so that \\\\lambda_1 \\\\geq \\\\lambda_2\\\\geq 0) and the corresponding eigenvectors e_1,e_2 summarize the distribution of the gradient abla I = (I_x,I_y) of I within the window defined by w centered at p. Namely, if \\\\lambda_1 > \\\\lambda_2, then e_1 (or -e_1) is the direction that is maximally aligned with the gradient within the window. In particular, if \\\\lambda_1 > 0, \\\\lambda_2 = 0 then the gradient is always a multiple of e_1 (positive, negative or zero); this is the case if and only if I within the window varies along the direction e_1 but is constant along e_2. This condition of eigenvalues is also called linear symmetry condition because then the iso-curves of I consist in parallel lines, i.e there exists a one dimensional function g which can generate the two dimensional function I as I(x,y)=g(d^\\\\text{T} p) for some constant vector d=(d_x,d_y)^T and the coordinates p=(x,y)^T . If \\\\lambda_1 = \\\\lambda_2, on the other hand, the gradient in the window has no predominant direction; which happens, for instance, when the image has rotational symmetry within that window. This condition of eigenvalues is also called balanced body, or directional equilibrium condition because it holds when all gradient directions in the window are equally frequent/probable. Furthermore, the condition \\\\lambda_1 = \\\\lambda_2 = 0 happens if and only if the function I is constant ( abla I = (0,0)) within W. More generally, the value of \\\\lambda_k , for k=1 or k=2, is the w-weighted average, in the neighborhood of p, of the square of the directional derivative of I along e_k. The relative discrepancy between the two eigenvalues of S_w is an indicator of the degree of anisotropy of the gradient in the window, namely how strongly is it biased towards a particular direction (and its opposite). This attribute can be quantified by the coherence, defined as :c_w=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_2}{\\\\lambda_1+\\\\lambda_2}\\\\right)^2 if \\\\lambda_2>0. This quantity is 1 when the gradient is totally aligned, and 0 when it has no preferred direction. The formula is undefined, even in the limit, when the image is constant in the window (\\\\lambda_1=\\\\lambda_2=0). Some authors define it as 0 in that case. Note that the average of the gradient abla I inside the window is not a good indicator of anisotropy. Aligned but oppositely oriented gradient vectors would cancel out in this average, whereas in the structure tensor they are properly added together. This is a reason for why ( abla I)( abla I)^\\\\text{T} is used in the averaging of the structure tensor to optimize the direction instead of abla I. By expanding the effective radius of the window function w (that is, increasing its variance), one can make the structure tensor more robust in the face of noise, at the cost of diminished spatial resolution.T. Lindeberg (1994), Scale-Space Theory in Computer Vision. Kluwer Academic Publishers, (see sections 14.4.1 and 14.2.3 on pages 359‚Äì360 and 355‚Äì356 for detailed statements about how the multi-scale second-moment matrix/structure tensor defines a true and uniquely determined multi-scale representation of directional data). The formal basis for this property is described in more detail below, where it is shown that a multi-scale formulation of the structure tensor, referred to as the multi- scale structure tensor, constitutes a true multi-scale representation of directional data under variations of the spatial extent of the window function. Complex version The interpretation and implementation of the 2D structure tensor becomes particularly accessible using complex numbers. The structure tensor consists in 3 real numbers : S_w(p) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mu_{20} & \\\\mu_{11} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] \\\\mu_{11} & \\\\mu_{02} \\\\end{bmatrix} where \\\\mu_{20} =\\\\int (w(r) (I_x(p-r))^2\\\\,d r , \\\\mu_{02} =\\\\int (w(r) (I_y(p-r))^2\\\\,d r and \\\\mu_{11} =\\\\int w(r) I_x(p-r)I_y(p-r)\\\\,d r in which integrals can be replaced by summations for discrete representation. Using Parseval relationship it is clear that the three real numbers are the second order moments of the power spectrum of I. The following second order complex moment of the power spectrum of I can then be written as \\\\kappa_{20} =\\\\mu_{20}-\\\\mu_{02}+i2\\\\mu_{11}=\\\\int (w(r) (I_x(p-r)+i I_y(p-r))^2\\\\,d r =(\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_2)\\\\exp(i2\\\\phi) where i=\\\\sqrt{-1} and \\\\phi is the direction angle of the most significant eigenvector of the structure tensor \\\\phi=\\\\angle{e_1} whereas \\\\lambda_1 and \\\\lambda_2 are the most and the least significant eigenvalues. From, this it follows that \\\\kappa_{20} contains both a certainty |\\\\kappa_{20}|=\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_2 and the optimal direction in double angle representation since it is a complex number consisting of two real numbers. It follows also that if the gradient is represented as a complex number, and is remapped by squaring (i.e. the argument angles of the complex gradient is doubled), then averaging acts as an optimizer in the mapped domain, since it directly delivers both the optimal direction (in double angle representation) and the associated certainty. The complex number represents thus how much linear structure (linear symmetry) there is in image I, and the complex number is obtained directly by averaging the gradient in its (complex) double angle representation without computing the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors explicitly. Likewise the following second order complex moment of the power spectrum of I, which happens to be always real because I is real, \\\\kappa_{11} =\\\\mu_{20}+\\\\mu_{02}=\\\\int (w(r) |I_x(p-r)+i I_y(p-r)|^2\\\\,d r =\\\\lambda_1+\\\\lambda_2 can be obtained, with \\\\lambda_1 and \\\\lambda_2 being the eigenvalues as before. Notice that this time the magnitude of the complex gradient is squared (which is always real). However, decomposing the structure tensor in its eigenvectors yields its tensor components as : S_w(p) = \\\\lambda_1 e_1e_1^\\\\text{T}+ \\\\lambda_2 e_2e_2^\\\\text{T} =(\\\\lambda_1 -\\\\lambda_2)e_1e_1^\\\\text{T}+ \\\\lambda_2( e_1e_1^\\\\text{T}+e_2e_2^\\\\text{T})= (\\\\lambda_1 -\\\\lambda_2)e_1e_1^\\\\text{T}+ \\\\lambda_2 E where E is the identity matrix in 2D because the two eigenvectors are always orthogonal (and sum to unity). The first term in the last expression of the decomposition, (\\\\lambda_1 -\\\\lambda_2)e_1e_1^\\\\text{T}, represents the linear symmetry component of the structure tensor containing all directional information (as a rank-1 matrix), whereas the second term represents the balanced body component of the tensor, which lacks any directional information (containing an identity matrix E). To know how much directional information there is in I is then the same as checking how large \\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_2 is compared to \\\\lambda_2. Evidently, \\\\kappa_{20} is the complex equivalent of the first term in the tensor decomposition, whereas (|\\\\kappa_{20}|-\\\\kappa_{11})/2=\\\\lambda_2is the equivalent of the second term. Thus the two scalars, comprising three real numbers, : \\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\kappa_{20} =(\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_2)\\\\exp(i2\\\\phi)&=&w;*(h*I)^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\kappa_{11} =\\\\lambda_1+\\\\lambda_2&=&w;*|h*I|^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} where h(x,y)=(x+iy)\\\\exp(-(x^2+y^2)/(2\\\\sigma^2)) is the (complex) gradient filter, and * is convolution, constitute a complex representation of the 2D Structure Tensor. As discussed here and elsewhere w defines the local image which is usually a Gaussian (with a certain variance defining the outer scale), and \\\\sigma is the (inner scale) parameter determining the effective frequency range in which the orientation 2\\\\phi is to be estimated. The elegance of the complex representation stems from that the two components of the structure tensor can be obtained as averages and independently. In turn, this means that \\\\kappa_{20} and \\\\kappa_{11} can be used in a scale space representation to describe the evidence for presence of unique orientation and the evidence for the alternative hypothesis, the presence of multiple balanced orientations, without computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. A functional, such as squaring the complex numbers have to this date not been shown to exist for structure tensors with dimensions higher than two. In Bigun 91, it has been put forward with due argument that this is because complex numbers are commutative algebras whereas quaternions, the possible candidate to construct such a functional by, constitute a non-commutative algebra. The complex representation of the structure tensor is frequently used in fingerprint analysis to obtain direction maps containing certainties which in turn are used to enhance them, to find the locations of the global (cores and deltas) and local (minutia) singularities, as well as automatically evaluate the quality of the fingerprints. The 3D structure tensor Definition The structure tensor can be defined also for a function I of three variables p=(x,y,z) in an entirely analogous way. Namely, in the continuous version we have S_w(p) = \\\\int w(r) S_0(p-r)\\\\,d r, where : S_0(p) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} (I_x(p))^2 & I_x(p)I_y(p) & I_x(p)I_z(p) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] I_x(p)I_y(p) & (I_y(p))^2 & I_y(p)I_z(p) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] I_x(p)I_z(p) & I_y(p)I_z(p) & (I_z(p))^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} where I_x,I_y,I_z are the three partial derivatives of I, and the integral ranges over \\\\mathbb{R}^3. In the discrete version,S_w[p]=\\\\sum_r w[r] S_0[p-r], where : S_0[p] = \\\\begin{bmatrix} (I_x[p])^2 & I_x[p]I_y[p] & I_x[p]I_z[p] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] I_x[p]I_y[p] & (I_y[p])^2 & I_y[p]I_z[p]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] I_x[p]I_z[p] & I_y[p]I_z[p] & (I_z[p])^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} and the sum ranges over a finite set of 3D indices, usually \\\\\\\\{-m..+m\\\\\\\\}\\\\times\\\\\\\\{-m..+m\\\\\\\\}\\\\times\\\\\\\\{-m..+m\\\\\\\\} for some m. Interpretation As in the three-dimensional case, the eigenvalues \\\\lambda_1,\\\\lambda_2,\\\\lambda_3 of S_w[p], and the corresponding eigenvectors e_1,e_2,e_3, summarize the distribution of gradient directions within the neighborhood of p defined by the window w. This information can be visualized as an ellipsoid whose semi-axes are equal to the eigenvalues and directed along their corresponding eigenvectors. Ellipsoidal representation of the 3D structure tensor. In particular, if the ellipsoid is stretched along one axis only, like a cigar (that is, if \\\\lambda_1 is much larger than both \\\\lambda_2 and \\\\lambda_3), it means that the gradient in the window is predominantly aligned with the direction e_1, so that the isosurfaces of I tend to be flat and perpendicular to that vector. This situation occurs, for instance, when p lies on a thin plate-like feature, or on the smooth boundary between two regions with contrasting values. {cellborder=0px border=0px |- valign=top The structure tensor ellipsoid of a surface-like neighborhood (\\"surfel\\"), where \\\\lambda_1 >\\\\\\\\!> \\\\lambda_2 \\\\approx \\\\lambda_3.||A 3D window straddling a smooth boundary surface between two uniform regions of a 3D image.||The corresponding structure tensor ellipsoid. |} If the ellipsoid is flattened in one direction only, like a pancake (that is, if \\\\lambda_3 is much smaller than both \\\\lambda_1 and \\\\lambda_2), it means that the gradient directions are spread out but perpendicular to e_3; so that the isosurfaces tend to be like tubes parallel to that vector. This situation occurs, for instance, when p lies on a thin line-like feature, or on a sharp corner of the boundary between two regions with contrasting values. {cellborder=0px border=0px |- valign=top The structure tensor of a line-like neighborhood (\\"curvel\\"), where \\\\lambda_1 \\\\approx \\\\lambda_2 >\\\\\\\\!> \\\\lambda_3.||A 3D window straddling a line-like feature of a 3D image.||The corresponding structure tensor ellipsoid. |} Finally, if the ellipsoid is roughly spherical (that is, if \\\\lambda_1\\\\approx\\\\lambda_2\\\\approx\\\\lambda_3), it means that the gradient directions in the window are more or less evenly distributed, with no marked preference; so that the function I is mostly isotropic in that neighborhood. This happens, for instance, when the function has spherical symmetry in the neighborhood of p. In particular, if the ellipsoid degenerates to a point (that is, if the three eigenvalues are zero), it means that I is constant (has zero gradient) within the window. {cellborder=0px border=0px |- valign=top The structure tensor in an isotropic neighborhood, where \\\\lambda_1\\\\approx\\\\lambda_2\\\\approx\\\\lambda_3.||A 3D window containing a spherical feature of a 3D image.||The corresponding structure tensor ellipsoid. |} The multi-scale structure tensor The structure tensor is an important tool in scale space analysis. The multi-scale structure tensor (or multi-scale second moment matrix) of a function I is in contrast to other one-parameter scale-space features an image descriptor that is defined over two scale parameters. One scale parameter, referred to as local scale t, is needed for determining the amount of pre-smoothing when computing the image gradient ( abla I)(x; t). Another scale parameter, referred to as integration scale s, is needed for specifying the spatial extent of the window function w(\\\\xi; s) that determines the weights for the region in space over which the components of the outer product of the gradient by itself ( abla I)( abla I)^\\\\text{T} are accumulated. More precisely, suppose that I is a real-valued signal defined over \\\\mathbb{R}^k. For any local scale t > 0, let a multi-scale representation I(x; t) of this signal be given by I(x; t) = h(x; t)*I(x) where h(x; t) represents a pre-smoothing kernel. Furthermore, let ( abla I)(x; t) denote the gradient of the scale space representation. Then, the multi-scale structure tensor/second-moment matrix is defined by J. Garding and T. Lindeberg (1996). \\"Direct computation of shape cues using scale-adapted spatial derivative operators, International Journal of Computer Vision, volume 17, issue 2, pages 163‚Äì191. : \\\\mu(x; t, s) = \\\\int_{\\\\xi \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^k} ( abla I)(x-\\\\xi; t) \\\\, ( abla I)^\\\\text{T}(x-\\\\xi; t) \\\\, w(\\\\xi; s) \\\\, d\\\\xi Conceptually, one may ask if it would be sufficient to use any self-similar families of smoothing functions h(x; t) and w(\\\\xi; s). If one naively would apply, for example, a box filter, however, then non-desirable artifacts could easily occur. If one wants the multi-scale structure tensor to be well-behaved over both increasing local scales t and increasing integration scales s, then it can be shown that both the smoothing function and the window function have to be Gaussian. The conditions that specify this uniqueness are similar to the scale-space axioms that are used for deriving the uniqueness of the Gaussian kernel for a regular Gaussian scale space of image intensities. There are different ways of handling the two-parameter scale variations in this family of image descriptors. If we keep the local scale parameter t fixed and apply increasingly broadened versions of the window function by increasing the integration scale parameter s only, then we obtain a true formal scale space representation of the directional data computed at the given local scale t. If we couple the local scale and integration scale by a relative integration scale r \\\\geq 1, such that s = r t then for any fixed value of r, we obtain a reduced self-similar one-parameter variation, which is frequently used to simplify computational algorithms, for example in corner detection, interest point detection, texture analysis and image matching. By varying the relative integration scale r \\\\geq 1 in such a self-similar scale variation, we obtain another alternative way of parameterizing the multi-scale nature of directional data obtained by increasing the integration scale. A conceptually similar construction can be performed for discrete signals, with the convolution integral replaced by a convolution sum and with the continuous Gaussian kernel g(x; t) replaced by the discrete Gaussian kernel T(n; t): : \\\\mu(x; t, s) = \\\\sum_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^k} ( abla I)(x-n; t) \\\\, ( abla I)^\\\\text{T}(x-n; t) \\\\, w(n; s) When quantizing the scale parameters t and s in an actual implementation, a finite geometric progression \\\\alpha^i is usually used, with i ranging from 0 to some maximum scale index m. Thus, the discrete scale levels will bear certain similarities to image pyramid, although spatial subsampling may not necessarily be used in order to preserve more accurate data for subsequent processing stages. Applications The eigenvalues of the structure tensor play a significant role in many image processing algorithms, for problems like corner detection, interest point detection, and feature tracking. The structure tensor also plays a central role in the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm, and in its extensions to estimate affine shape adaptation; where the magnitude of \\\\lambda_2 is an indicator of the reliability of the computed result. The tensor has been used for scale space analysis, estimation of local surface orientation from monocular or binocular cues, non-linear fingerprint enhancement, A. Almansa and T. Lindeberg (2000), Enhancement of fingerprint images using shape- adaptated scale-space operators. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, volume 9, number 12, pages 2027‚Äì2042. diffusion-based image processing,J. Weickert (1998), Anisotropic diffusion in image processing, Teuber Verlag, Stuttgart. and several other image processing problems. The structure tensor can be also applied in geology to filter seismic data. Processing spatio-temporal video data with the structure tensor The three-dimensional structure tensor has been used to analyze three-dimensional video data (viewed as a function of x, y, and time t). If one in this context aims at image descriptors that are invariant under Galilean transformations, to make it possible to compare image measurements that have been obtained under variations of a priori unknown image velocities v = (v_x, v_y)^\\\\text{T} : \\\\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\\\\\\\\\ y' \\\\\\\\\\\\ t' \\\\end{bmatrix} = G \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\\\\\\\\\ t \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x - v_x \\\\, t \\\\\\\\\\\\ y - v_y \\\\, t \\\\\\\\\\\\ t \\\\end{bmatrix} , it is, however, from a computational viewpoint preferable to parameterize the components in the structure tensor/second-moment matrix S using the notion of Galilean diagonalization : S' = R_\\\\text{space}^{-\\\\text{T}} \\\\, G^{-\\\\text{T}} \\\\, S \\\\, G^{-1} \\\\, R_\\\\text{space}^{-1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} u_1 & \\\\, & \\\\, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\, & u_2 & \\\\, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\, & \\\\, & u_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} where G denotes a Galilean transformation of spacetime and R_\\\\text{space} a two-dimensional rotation over the spatial domain, compared to the abovementioned use of eigenvalues of a 3-D structure tensor, which corresponds to an eigenvalue decomposition and a (non- physical) three-dimensional rotation of spacetime : S = R_\\\\text{spacetime}^{-\\\\text{T}} \\\\, S \\\\, R_\\\\text{spacetime}^{-1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\lambda_1 & & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\lambda_2 & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & \\\\lambda_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} . To obtain true Galilean invariance, however, also the shape of the spatio-temporal window function needs to be adapted, corresponding to the transfer of affine shape adaptation from spatial to spatio-temporal image data. In combination with local spatio-temporal histogram descriptors, these concepts together allow for Galilean invariant recognition of spatio-temporal events.

In August 1940, Little Sister Magdeleine returned to France and found three quarters of her country occupied. In these difficult circumstances she gave many talks and showed a film that she had made herself of her life in Touggourt with her nomad friends: > \\"With this film I want to bring you joy and hope. I want to show you what > faith can do with the life of one sick person.

But before leaving for the Sahara they needed to be formed in this new way of contemplative life at the heart of the world and also to have a place to live. She was given a house outside Aix-en-Provence called Le Tubet, which was to become the Mother house. > \\"This house is the answer to all my prayers. What a wonderful present!\\" > noted Little Sister Magdeleine in her diary.Little Sister Magdeleine of > Jesus: He took me by the hand, page 60 Expansion On 26 July 1946, whilst on pilgrimage to La Sainte Baume, Little Sister Magdeleine became convinced that the Community of the Little sisters should extend to every country. 1946 was also when some Little Sisters took jobs in factories, becoming workers among other workers. > \\"Four Little Sisters are starting work at the factory.. My job will be to > work on the machines which are used for cutting out the cases for > pharmaceutical powders - 40,000 a day, always repeating the same action... I > have been appreciating the beauty of this manual work in the tradition of > Jesus of Nazareth.I know that the forty workers in this room, in front of > their forty machines, have a unique value and dignity so that sharing their > lot in life can in no way detract from my own dignity as a member of a > religious order.\\"Little sister Magdeleine of Jesus: He took me by the hand, > page 121, 122 In the Sahara, Little Sisters of Jesus were already nomads living alongside other nomads. Other communities lived and worked among factory and craft workers, those who worked on the land, with the sick, with shepherds, Travellers, Pygmies, fairground and circus people. Communities began in Switzerland, Brazil, Morocco, the Middle East, Central Africa, India, Vietnam... In 1951 Little Sister Magdeleine received permission to found a community in a very poor neighbourhood of Rome, Borgata Prenestina, in a temporary dwelling like that of the neighbours. To live alongside in friendship and solidarity following Jesus of Nazareth was the key to this new vocation in the Church. Little Sister Magdeleine boldly and tenaciously defended this new form of religious life when questioned by the authorities of the Church and made three appeals to Pope Pius XII, the first in December 1944 through an intermediary, Archbishop Montini (the future Pope Paul VI), and directly in June 1947 and again in July 1948. The following is taken from her second appeal: > \\"The Little Sisters ask to be allowed to live as the leaven in the dough of > humanity. They desire to integrate totally with other human beings, while > leading a deeply contemplative life, like that of Jesus in the carpenter's > shop at Nazareth and on the highways and byways of his public life. > \\"The Little Sisters identify wholly with the working class, but represent at > the same time a bridge between all classes, races and religions. They must > be a catalyst for worker and employer, Muslim and Christian, so that each > learns to live with the other, loving with a greater love and doing away > with all hatred and enmity. > \\"Their community life should be a living witness to Christian love, , 'Jesus > Caritas'. They will not be cloistered. Their doors will always be open, so > that their communities will be a meeting ground for lay and religious who > will find there deeper understanding and greater love. The Little Sisters > would like to live as one with the working class, in the factories and > workshops. They ask for nothing more than to be thought of as \`workers among > workers', as they are \`Arabs among Arabs' and \`nomads among nomads', so that > the light of Christ shines out of them, in humility and silence. In the > lives of the Little Sisters we must see, from near at hand, the real face of > the religious life and of the Church, the real face of Christ.\\"Little sister > Magdeleine of Jesus: He took me by the hand, page 189 From the time of the foundation her love for the Church never slackened. It was important for her to submit to the Church authorities all that she lived and above all her most daring projects. > \\"There are so many opportunities to break down barriers, that go against the > rules.

She undertook a tour of the world and communities were started on every continent. This led to vocations from every race and culture and rite. In 1948 there were 75 Little Sisters of Jesus living in 13 communities. By 1953 there were over 300 sisters in 100 communities. Having already travelled to more than forty countries, in August 1953 Little Sister Magdeleine and Little Sister Jeanne undertook a last world tour, crossing the five continents in one year. They travelled across Niger, Camerouns, East Africa, South Africa, then West Africa from where they took a boat for South America and Mexico. From there they went to Martinique, Cuba and Haiti, arriving in North America and reaching Alaska and from there to Asia. They travelled through Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and French Indochina, going to Australia and Papua-New Guinea, continuing with newly independent Indonesia, Ceylon, India and Pakistan, even entering into Afghanistan. They finished by Iran and Turkey, returning to Aix-en-Provence on 30 August 1954. > \\"You should choose to live among the poorest and most forgotten, where no- > one else would go, among nomads or other ignored and disregarded minorities. > Look at the map of the world and see if you can find a handful of people > scattered over a large territory and difficult to reach...

As soon as she heard about a country whose frontiers were closed she wanted to go there. Believing that even an iron curtain could open, from 1957 onwards she began her journeys to Eastern Europe. Every year she left discreetly with a small group of Little Sisters to visit friends in the different countries behind the iron curtain. Such journeys prepared for the present day communities in these countries. She travelled in a Citroen van, rearranged for up to four Little Sisters to live and sleep in, which she called \\"the Shooting star\\". In the front of the van, the Blessed Sacrament was reserved as it is wherever the Sisters live, even if it be a caravan, a tent or a hut. Russia In 1952, Little Sister Magdeleine wrote: > \\"When I'll have completed my task as foundress, in response to what seems to > me to be a very strong inner call, if God does not put anything in my > way....

In 1956 a collection of wooden prefabricated houses were built under the eucalyptus trees on a piece of ground belonging to the Trappist Fathers of Tre Fontane, near the site of the beheading of St Paul, which became the Generalate in 1964. The Little sisters built this family house where they could gather from every corner of the world and where Little Sisters of every nationality could come to prepare for final vows. From such diverse cultures it was a unique occasion to share and to broaden their vision. The Vatican Council and Ecumenism The opening of the Second Vatican Council in 1962 brought many bishops to Rome (many of whom took the opportunity to visit Tre Fontane). Vatican Council II would affirm some of Little Sister Magdeleine's intuitions, above all her desire for unity between the Churches. Already in 1948 she made her first contact with Brother Roger of Taiz√©. She met the Patriarch Athenagoras several times and Metropolitan Bartholomew who later became Ecumenical Patriarch. Recognition by the Church Madeleine and Anne made their first temporary vows in the diocese of Algeria with the blessing of Bishop Nouet. The Little Sisters of Jesus officially began in 1942 when Little Sister Magdeleine took final vows under the auspices of Bishop de Villerabel at Le Tubet, the Mother House, in Aix-en- Provence. In 1945 Bishop de Provenchƒóres was named bishop of Aix-en-Provence and he supported this new form of religious life, including its expansion among factory workers, nomads, prisoners... In 1946, following the decision to expand throughout the world, the Little Sisters of Jesus became a recognised diocesan congregation of the archdiocese of Aix-en-Provence. After 1948, as communities of Little Sisters of Jesus were established in the Middle East, among Christians of that region, belonging to several Eastern Catholic Churches: Maronite, Syrian, Coptic, Armenian and Chaldean. With communities established worldwide, the Little Sisters of Jesus applied for recognition as being of Pontifical Right.Code of Canon Law: Can. 589: \\"An institute of consecrated life is of pontifical right if it has been established by the Apostolic See, or approved by it by means of a formal decree. An institute is of diocesan right if it has been established by the diocesan Bishop and has not obtained a decree of approval from the Apostolic See.\\" and as a result, throughout 1960, an Apostolic Visitor closely examined the progress of the congregation. This entailed a great struggle for Little Sister Magdeleine who was trying to reconcile her belief in obedience to the Church with her desire to be faithful to the insights she saw as fundamental to the vocation of the Little Sisters of Jesus, as the Apostolic Visitor asked her to rewrite important passages of the Constitutions. > \\"I do it with all my heart so as to reconcile obedience towards the Visitor > with the mission which the Lord has confided to me. More and more I think > there are certain points on which I will never give way: total poverty, > littleness, spiritual childhood, contemplative life.\\" (Letter, 7 April > 1960)Little Sister Magdeleine of Jesus (1986): Lettres 1957-65, Citta Nuova; > http://www.jesuscaritas.info/jcd/en/node/4443 . The Little Sisters of Jesus were recognised as of being of Pontifical Right on 25 March 1964 and the Generalate was established at Tre Fontane, Rome on 31 May 1964. On that day, Little Sister Magdeleine wrote to Pope Paul VI that it was the realisation of her dream as a foundress. Both Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul II (22 December 1985) visited the Little Sisters of Jesus at Tre Fontane. Pope Paul VI made a surprise visit on 28 September 1973 when he told them: > \\"I have come to give you recognition on behalf of the Church, to tell you > that the Church is truly happy about your existence, about your presence, > happy for you to be what you are.\\" Definitive approval of the Constitutions of the Little Sisters of Jesus followed in 1988. A last journey to Eastern Europe In 1989, at the age of 91, Little Sister Magdeleine made her last journey to Eastern Europe, including Russia where she met Fr. Alexander Men of the Russian Orthodox Church, a writer and inspirational preacher influential among the young. He was later assassinated. 50th Anniversary Celebrations On 8 September 1989, the 50th Anniversary of the Community was celebrated. At a papal audience during the celebrations, Pope John Paul II told the Little Sisters of Jesus > \\"Your history is only just beginning!\\"Pope John Paul II, Address for the > 50th Anniversary of the Foundation of the Little Sisters (1989), > http://www.jesuscaritas.info/jcd/en/node/3044 and > https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1989/september/index.htm > which links to the Pope's address in Italian and French. Little Sister Magdeleine's Death Little Sister Magdeleine died on 6 November 1989 at Tre Fontane, Rome, in a little room prepared to welcome young people travelling the roads. Her funeral and farewell Mass (during which the Gospel was sung in Arabic) took place in the open air in Tre Fontane on 10 November 1989 - the day the Berlin Wall fell. Little Sisters of Jesus Today There are communities of Little Sisters of Jesus scattered around the world in 63 countries. There are about 1400 members of 65 different nationalities. Some communities date from the first years of the Foundation while new communities continue to be established. A community is usually three or four Little Sisters, often from different races, nationalities and backgrounds. Vocation of the Little Sisters of Jesus Living in small communities, Little Sisters of Jesus seek to lead a contemplative life in the midst of people. They are inspired by the thirty years Jesus spent in Nazareth and by his humble birth in Bethlehem. They understand Nazareth not as a particular place, but as the ordinariness of peoples' lives. They share day- to-day life, living conditions, work and dreams, especially of the less privileged and of those who are on the fringes of society. Often staying in rented accommodation or where poorer people live, they take ordinary jobs or work alongside their neighbours and practice hospitality. You will find them in housing projects, inner-city neighbourhoods, in rural areas as well as among nomadic people. Some work in factories or do low paid manual work others make a livelihood adopting the same lifestyle as those whose life they share. Their lifelong call is a non-professional one: By preference they seek to live among those who are inaccessible to other forms of Church ministry or whose day-to-day life is marked by division, racism, poverty or violence. Their contemplative life is one of intercession for their neighbours and friends and for everyone, recognising that the presence of Jesus in the Eucharist (which is present in each community's home) cannot be separated from his presence among people, especially among those who are suffering. Little Sister Magdeleine summed up the vocation of the Little Sisters of Jesus in these words: > \\"If I were told to define the mission of our community in a single word, I > would not hesitate for a single moment to cry, 'Unity'. All our vocation can > be summed up in the word, 'Unity'\\"Little Sister Magdeleine of Jesus (1985): > Lettres 1950-57, Citta Nuova; Constitutions of the Little Sisters of Jesus: > Unity in Love: http://www.jesuscaritas.info/jcd/en/node/3287 Sources *Little Sister Magdeleine of Jesus (1981).

After a brief turn in the VBB (Verband Berliner Ballspielvereine or Federation of Berlin Ballplay Teams) the club turned to varsity competition and organized the first varsity football championship in the city in 1903. They met Preussen Berlin in the final, defeating them by a score of 2:1. Akademischer SC and Britannia Berlin also took part in the competition.

It was directed by Alain Resnais, and written by Agn√®s Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri. Jaoui and Bacri also starred in the film with Sabine Az√©ma, Lambert Wilson, Andr√© Dussollier and Pierre Arditi.  Plot  Odile (Az√©ma), a business executive, is married to weak, furtive Claude (Arditi). In the past Odile was close to successful businessman Nicolas (Bacri), now married with kids and returning to Paris after an eight-year absence. She is looking for a new, bigger apartment from estate agent Marc (Wilson). Her younger sister Camille (Jaoui), has just completed her doctoral thesis in history and is a Paris tour guide. Simon (Dussollier) is a regular on Camille's tours because he's attracted to her, although he claims to be researching his historical radio dramas. Camille has fallen for Marc, and they begin an affair. Nicolas is also looking for an apartment, since he hopes to eventually have his family join him in Paris. The most original feature of this \\"musical\\" is that characters break into songs as sung by the original artists, i.e. depending on the circumstances, a female character may all of a sudden start singing in a male voice and vice versa. The judicious choice of songs and variety of styles make for some very funny surprises, considering the complete and voluntary absence of transitions between the talking and singing. The film's debt to Dennis Potter is acknowledged with a dedication in the opening credits.

Formation  The band started when Daniel Bartels and David Bush, who were working together at an oriental rug store, asked Clancy Fraher and Steve Brooking to join them. Fraher taught Bartels some open tunings on his new telecaster, then promptly left the country to explore Europe for a month. When Fraher returned, Daniel had begun creating his own musical vocabulary that was later crucial in setting this band apart from the typical 2-guitar bands of the day. Many reviewers likened them to Television.  Southern States  The band did a couple of songs with David Lowery. The group's manager at the time, Caroline Frye, sent out six demo cassettes to a select group of indie labels. The New York-based SpinART Records signed the band to a deal. The first record, Southern States, was mostly a compilation of singles and material that had been released previously. It was a broad collection of rock flavors stirred over a few years. CMJ New Music Monthly called the album \\"alternately spacey and dense,\\" writing that \\"with equal emphasis on crafted songwriting and biting guitar hooks, the band maintains a sense of style and flair.\\" The album peaked at 43 in the CMJ chart. The second record for SpinART, The Oswald Cup, was more of a concentrated effort. The group worked with producer Rich Costey to create an album that highlighted their guitar work and studied interplay with the rhythm section. The Washington Post called the album \\"a survey of indie-rock guitar-band styles ... With a little more personality, the album might even be as engaging as it is impressive.\\" AllMusic wrote that \\"singing guitarists Daniel Bartels and Clancy Fraher spin murky and dark-hued waves of sound topped with liquid and melodic lead lines that regularly break out of the soundscapes just enough to keep the whole thing from skittering off into post-rock pretentiousness.\\" Touring band  The regular rhythm section was restricted by career choices and were not able to tour. As a result, Fraher and Bartels chose to take members of their favorite Richmond punk bands out as substitutes. John Gotschalk (Kneivels, Nrg Krysys-bass), Ricky Tubb (Waking Hours-bass), Bret Payne (Morefire for Burning People-drums), Becky Sanchez-Burr (Morefire...-bass), and David Ramsden were among the few that took up the challenge. Fraher and Bartels found this method to be unsatisfactory and decided ultimately to hang it up after the release of The Oswald Cup. SpinArt virtually shelved the record temporarily and its release was never fully promoted. Reunion The group reunited for a show on November 24, 2012, in Richmond, Virginia. It was a fundraiser for WRIR, Richmond Independent Radio. Clancy Fraher resides in Chicago and performs in The New Messengers.

He is alleged to have played a key role in the Castellammarese War (1929‚Äì1931) as the assassin of Giuseppe Morello and others. Some claim that Buster was gangster Sebastiano Domingo (1910-1933),Critchley, David. \\"Buster, Maranzano, and the Castellammare War 1930‚Äì31,\\" Global Crime, Vol. 7, No.1, February 2006. p. 6 notably Bill Bonanno, the son of Bonanno crime family leader Joseph Bonanno, who participated in the War.Bill Bonanno and Gary B. Abromovitz, \\"The Last Testament of Bill Bonanno\\" New York: HarperCollins, 2011 Others charge that Buster is a character created by Joe Valachi to evade his responsibility for various killings.May, Allan, Mob Stories, \\"'Buster from Chicago' ‚Äì Revealed?\\" Life as hitman Buster's crime companions knew little of his background, other than that he was from Chicago. Joe Valachi, a mobster turned government informant, described Buster as a \\"college boy\\" in appearance and claimed he carried a Tommy gun inside a large violin case.Maas, p. 60 While working with the unknown assassin, Valachi noted his exceptional skill with a wide range of weaponry including pistols, shotguns and machine guns. Contrary to Valachi's story that has him hiding a Tommygun in a violin case (the Thompson won't fit in a violin case), Buster did carry a sawed-off, 12 gauge pump shotgun in a guitar case.Critchley, pp. 21‚Äì22 Buster's first murder assignment for Salvatore Maranzano was to kill Giuseppe Morello. On August 15, 1930, Morello and Joseph Perrano were shot dead in the former's East Harlem office. Two gunmen were seen fleeing the scene. Some accounts claim that Albert Anastasia and Frank Scalise were the shooters that day,\\"Buster from Chicago (?-1931): Hit man \\", The Mafia Encyclopedia although Valachi wrote that Buster was responsible. Buster was also responsible for the deaths of top Masseria lieutenants Alfred Mineo and Steve Ferrigno, gunning them down with his guitar-cased shotgun as they walked through the courtyard of a Bronx apartment complex on November 5, 1930. As his accomplices, Girolamo \\"Bobby Doyle\\" Santuccio and Nick Capuzzi, fled the scene, Buster allegedly ran into an investigating patrolman who had heard the gunfire. In the guise of a frightened bystander, Buster told the officer the direction of the shooting and calmly walked away as the officer rushed to the scene. Joe Valachi then picked up the three assassins and sped them to safety.Critchley, p. 22. On February 3, 1931, Buster was stationed in a basement apartment on Belmont Avenue in the Bronx in order to watch for Giuseppe Catania aka Joe the Baker. As his quarry left a store across the street with his wife, Buster opened fire. Catania fell mortally wounded and Buster made a clean getaway in the commotion that followed. Buster was supposedly proud of the fact that, despite the wide blast pattern of his shotgun, Catania's wife was unharmed. Although he survived the Castellammarese War, Buster was distrustful of the new mob regime. According to Valachi, Buster wanted to continue fighting against Lucky Luciano because \\"They'll take us away, one by one.\\"Maas, pp. 84‚Äì85 After this, according to Valachi's McClellan Committee testimony, Buster \\"was killed during an argument at a crap game.\\" Sebastiano Domingo Sebastiano Domingo was born in 1910 in Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily. Sebastiano's nickname was Bastiano (hence Buster), and he also used the alias of Charles Domingo. In Valachi's unpublished memoirs, he claimed that Buster from Chicago, \\"is Castellamarese (sic) and that's why the old man got him to join in with us.\\" Domingo and his family immigrated to America in 1913 and settled in Chicago's Little Italy. The family lived on Oak Street, near the infamous Death Corner that was the scene of many Black Hand-related murders. By 1920, the Domingo family was recorded as living on a farm near Benton Harbor, Michigan. Bastiano's older brother Tony was a member of a small fraternity of Castellammare families that sold illegal alcohol in the Benton Harbor area. Tragedy marked Domingo's stay in Michigan. On December 31, 1925, Bastiano's six-year-old niece Matilda was accidentally shot and killed by her ten-year- old uncle Leo DiMaria, who had been playing with a revolver he found in the cushions of a couch. Eight months later two of Domingo's cousins, Sam and Frank DiMaria, lost their lives in a distillery accident. On October 22, 1927, Bastiano's sister-in-law Mary Domingo was killed by a car bomb apparently meant for her estranged husband Tony. He and 17-year-old Bastiano shot up a local social club where the alleged bomber, Louis Vieglo, was hiding. Both were arrested before they could kill their target. Bastiano told the police that he was Tony Domingo's brother \\"Charles\\". By late 1928, the Domingo family had returned to Chicago. On August 29, 1929, Tony Domingo was shot to death while eating in an Ogden Street restaurant operated by Pasquale Spilotro (father of future Chicago mobster Tony Spilotro). Bastiano had been seen hanging out in the neighborhood with his brother in the weeks before Tony's murder. The elder Domingo's killer was never positively identified. By the spring of 1930, Bastiano had moved in with relatives in Westchester County, New York. The youthful (and mostly unknown) Sebastiano Domingo was ready to join the Maranzano family.Critchley, pp. 6‚Äì8 On May 30, 1933, Sebastiano \\"Bastiano\\" Domingo was playing cards with a few others at the Castle Cafe in Manhattan's Lower East Side. As they were, four gunmen barged inside and opened fire on the card players. An eyewitness reported that one of the triggermen yelled, \\"You bunch of rats,\\" just before the bullets began flying. Police found Domingo dead on the sidewalk outside the cafe and five other men wounded. One of the victims, Salvatore Ferrara, eventually died of his wounds. Over 200 friends and relatives attended the dual funeral at St. John's Cemetery on June 3, 1933.Critchley, p. 9. Joe Valachi In A Man of Honor (1983), mob boss Joseph Bonanno identifies Buster as Sebastiano Domingo: According to Bonanno: Bonanno's description of Buster is different from Valachi's. Bonanno's Buster is short instead of tall like Valachi's. Allan May argues that Buster is a character invented by Valachi to avoid acknowledging his own role in the killings of Mineo and Ferrigno. Valachi was inducted as a \\"made man\\" immediately after these killings. Furthermore, according to May, there was no obvious motive for the mob to induct him at this point. However, it must be remembered that Bonanno was attempting to recall and describe comparative height after 30 years, and a photograph allegedly of \\"Buster\\" printed in Joseph Bonanno's book shows a man of medium height. Moreover, May himself did not attempt, he argued because of this issue over the height of Buster, to research the broader revelation made by Bonanno that \\"Bastiano\\" Domingo was, indeed, the fabled Castellammare War gunman. In addition, Maranzano had a strong motive to induct Domingo into his crime family in November 1930, from observing his highly effective role in the previous murders of Manfredi Mineo and Steve Ferrigno, top men in the Masseria mob.

Spady is an academic, educational psychologist, sociologist and is considered the father of Outcome-Based Education (OBE). He is largely noted for his works that attempt to expand and enhance the philosophical grounding and performance of educators, leaders, educational systems, and learners. Spady is also the head of ChangeLeaders.  Background  Spady became a lecturer at Harvard University and the Ontario Institute of Education from 1967 to 1973. He has also worked as a senior research sociologist at the National Institute of Education and as an Associate Executive Director of the American Association for School Administrators.  Spady and OBE  Spady coined the term outcome-based education in 1988 as an extension of the works completed by John Franklin Bobbitt and Ralph W. Tyler. OBE is referred to by over 20 different names including Systemic education restructuring, Performance Based Education, Standards based education reform, High Performance Learning, Total Quality Management, Transformational Education, and Competency-Based Education. In his conceptualization, Spady described OBE as the reorientation in educational system towards what is essential for all students to be successful at the end of their learning experiences. This primarily entails the identification of what is important for the learners to be able to do so that the curriculum, instruction and assessment are organized accordingly. Spady's research is still widely cited in nations such as Australia which are still adopting OBE. Nevertheless, the names have been changed in the US largely due strong negative responses to these programs when they have been introduced to actual students and parents. All of these titles refer to a similar philosophy and a plan which implements radical and \\"systemic\\" change into schools. Many have researched the thousands of articles on the internet referring to Spady, with many showing the beneficial effects of his theories on actual children.\\"Last December, the School Board approved the hiring of William Spady of ChangeLeaders, .. is sociologist and the self- proclaimed father of OBE\\" Spady also participated in the Task Force on Education Organization created in Minnesota by a 1988 legislative session. The task force's draft for outcomes system followed his approach. He was honored for his OBE work in the Philippines in 2015, where they are implementing OBE in some of their schools for grade level 10-12.  Works  Spady is the author or co-author of nine books. His latest book, _Bringing Heart and Soul to Education_ , was published in 2014. He has also worked for Breakthrough Learning at Dillon, Colorado.

All of its members studied or taught at the Birmingham School of Art after the reorganisation of its teaching methods by Edward R. Taylor in the 1880s, and it was the School that formed the group's primary focus. Members of the group also overlapped with other more formal organisations, including the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft, the Ruskin Pottery and the Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts. The Group formed one of the last outposts of late Romanticism in the visual arts, and an important link between the last of the Pre-Raphaelites and the new Slade Symbolists. History The Birmingham School of Art They began to form in an informal manner in the 1890s. Many were later to become teachers in Birmingham (especially the great Birmingham Municipal School of Art under Edward R. Taylor), and this meant that the Edward Burne-Jones style influenced all those who studied at the Birmingham art schools. Many were also heavily influenced by the ideas and practices of John Ruskin and William Morris, and had indeed personally known those men. Several had undertaken work for the Kelmscott Press, with Charles March Gere producing the famous frontispiece to News from Nowhere. Many, unable to support themselves only through their art, also became fine crafts makers as well as teachers. There was initially no formal membership, but during the 1930s they were known to have had a membership secretary. Some of their members later became part of the Birmingham Surrealists group of artists, thus carrying to English Surrealism the rich vein of Romantic concern with emotional states in pictures, with myth and fantasy, with visions, and with a \\"natural supernaturalist\\" experience conveyed through art. The Birmingham Surrealists had made contact with the London Surrealist Group around 1940 and ex Birmingham Group members such as Emmy Bridgwater exhibited at the International Surrealist show in Paris in 1947.

He signed as a free agent with the New York Giants in Major League Baseball (MLB) before the season, but was released prior to the season. Kennedy caught on with the Birmingham Black Barons, and later the Kansas City Monarchs, both of the Negro American League. Near the end of the season, with Kennedy having led the NAL batting race for most of the year, the Monarchs sold his contract to the Philadelphia Phillies. When Kennedy made his big league debut (April 22, 1957 at Roosevelt Stadium), he became the first black player in Phillies history. The game was exactly 10 years to the day after manager Ben Chapman's Phillies had so taunted rookie Jackie Robinson in Brooklyn. Playing against the Brooklyn Dodgers, Kennedy entered the game in the top of the 8th inning as a pinch runner for Solly Hemus, who had doubled, but he did not score. The Dodgers won, 5-1. Kennedy's next game was two days later, playing against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Connie Mack Stadium. He entered the game in the bottom of the 6th as a pinch runner for Harry Anderson, who had singled, and later scored on a bases-loaded triple by Ed Bouchee. The Phillies won, 8-5. Kennedy got into a total of just five games, the last one on May 3, 1957. At the plate, he was 0-for-2, including one strikeout. In his two appearances at shortstop he had one assist, one error, and participated in one double play.

Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on Merritt Island, Florida where journalists have observed every U.S. crewed space launch since Apollo 8 in 1968.All preceding crewed flights, including Apollo 7, launched from pads at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The site is just south of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB); 3 miles (4.8 km) west-southwest of Pad A, and 3.4 miles (5.4 km) southwest of Pad B.The STS-121 launch seen from the LC-39 Press Site in July 2006 The site includes an elevated mound where news media facilities are located, as well as the KSC News Center and several smaller support buildings. The News Center is and contains 15 site support offices, media workspace, and a media library. Current media buildings include CBS, NBC, Florida Today and The Orlando Sentinel; and trailers for The Associated Press and Reuters. The 100-seat auditorium in the audio-video support building, where pre- and post-launch news conferences are held, is named for former CNN correspondent John Holliman, who covered space exploration until his death in 1998. It was built in 1980. A large illuminated digital countdown clock and a flagpole flying an American flag on the edge of the turning basin have often been included in television coverage and launch photos. Before a launch, the clock counts down, showing the remaining time until T-zero in hours, minutes and seconds (-00:00:00). After launch, the clock counts forward in Mission Elapsed Time for several hours. The flagpole also flew a smaller Space Shuttle Orbiter-specific flag below the American flag on launch day during the final years of the Space Shuttle Program. History The site was ready for coverage of the first launch from KSC, the uncrewed Apollo 4 flight on November 9, 1967, for which NASA received 510 requests for news media accreditation. The sound of this first Saturn V liftoff was sufficiently powerful at the Press Site to prompt CBS-TV anchor Walter Cronkite to exclaim, \\"Our building's shaking here...the floor is shaking...this big glass window is shaking, we're holding it with our hands!\\" A ceiling tile or two were shaken loose above his head.Aerial view of the Press Site in May 1969 looking north with the VAB at upper rightThe grandstand before the Apollo 12 launch in November 1969 During the Apollo program, the NASA news center was located in Cocoa Beach.. To provide on-site public affairs offices, a Charter-Sphere dome from the Third Century America exhibition near the VAB during the United States Bicentennial in 1976 was later moved to the mound. In 1983, it was replaced by a larger dome; and a permanent building, the current KSC News Center, replaced that dome in December 1995. During the first decade of Space Shuttle launches, NASA contractors provided reference materials to the media from the Joint Industry Press Center (JIPC, pronounced \\"gypsy\\"), housed in a semi-permanent trailer located near a large covered grandstand facing the two launch pads. The grandstand, built in 1967, was torn down following damage from Hurricane Frances in September 2004. Several media trailers and buildings on the mound were also damaged, and were either removed or replaced with prefabricated structures. On November 10, 2014, NASA powered on the clock for the last time for a final system test. The clock was supposed to be removed and replaced before the Orion EFT-1 Launch. The old clock is currently on display at the KSC Visitor Complex. Media attendance Composite photo of Apollo 11 launch and the Press Site flagOn July 16, 1969, 3,493 journalists from the U.S. and 55 other countries attended the launch of Apollo 11.Life July 25, 1969, p. 23 A plaque noting the event placed in 1975 by Sigma Delta Chi, the Society of Professional Journalists, designates the location as an Historic Site in Journalism for \\"the largest corps of newsmen in history...to report fully and freely to the largest audience in history\\". After Apollo 11, however, media attendance diminished. Apollo 17, the last in the lunar landing program and its only night launch, prompted a resurgence in attendance, as did the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project launch in 1975. The STS-1 launch on April 12, 1981 had 2,707 accredited representatives present. The second-largest number, 2,468, was for the STS-26 launch on September 29, 1988. Most, however, covered the launch from a more distant causeway viewing site because the LC-39 Press Site was restricted to a limited number of journalists as part of safety precautions implemented after the 1986 Challenger explosion. The restriction was dropped for subsequent launches. Media attendance spiked again in October 1998 for John Glenn's launch aboard STS-95, and for the final shuttle launch, STS-135, on July 8, 2011 when 1,585 news people attended. Historic status On July 16, 1974, a crowd gathered at the Press Site to dedicate the entire launch complex as a National Historic Site, which had been listed as of May 24, 1973. The countdown clock was set to reach zero at 9:32 a.m. ET, exactly five years after the Apollo 11 liftoff. Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins then unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight. On January 21, 2000, the \\"LC-39 Press Site-Clock and Flag Pole\\" were specifically added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as part of a Multiple Property Submission.

Paolo Treves worked for the Milanese socialist paper La Giustizia in the early 1920s and studied under Benedetto Croce, with whom he corresponded until the outbreak of war despite the latter's tacit support for Benito Mussolini. After the Fascist takeover, Paolo was singled out and detained for several months by the government, primarily because of Mussolini's hatred of the elder Treves. After fleeing Italy, Paolo became a member of the Executive Committee of the underground Partito Socialista Italiano (PSI). He worked as a liaison officer with Italian exiles in Paris and then, following his father's death in 1933, lived in the UK from 1938 to 1944. Treves studied Linguistics at Liverpool University in 1939 and became a lecturer in Italian at Bedford College of the University of London. He was recruited to be a scriptwriter and broadcaster for the Italian section of the BBC in 1940 and worked for the BBC until 1944. He contributed to several papers on Italian affairs and published 'What Mussolini did to us' (1940) and 'Italy, Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow' (1942). As a member of the London branch of the PSI, Treves sat on the Advisory Committee of International Socialist Forum and the International Bureau of the Fabian Society.

They number around 23,000 according to Ethnologue surveys. The Triqui language is a Mixtecan language of Oto-Manguean genetic affiliation. Trique peoples are known for their distinctive woven huipiles, baskets, and morrales (handbags).Takahashi, Masako. Mexican Textiles: Spirit and Style. Chronicle Books. 2003. Triqui people live in a mountainous region, called \\"La Mixteca Baja\\", in the southwestern part of the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. The elevation within the Triqui region varies between . This high elevation permits low-lying cumulus clouds to envelop entire towns during the afternoons and evenings. Like many other southern Mexicans, many Triqui men travel to Oaxaca City, Mexico City, or the United States as day labourers or migrant workers. As the average daily salary of a rural Oaxacan is less than $5 (U.S.) and La Mixteca is the poorest region of Oaxaca, migration and remittances sent back to Oaxaca confer economic benefits to both migrant Triquis and their families in Oaxaca.Murphy, Arthur D., Stepick, Alex. Social Inequality in Oaxaca: A History of Resistance and Change. Temple University Press. 1991Holmes, Seth M. An Ethnographic Study of the Social Context of Migrant Health in the United States. PLoS Med 3(10): e448 . 2006 Triqui women are more likely to remain in the Triqui region and do not travel as often as Triqui men do. Custom One of the notable customs of Triqui people is the practice of bride price. During pre-colonial and colonial times, this was a common practice amongst Native Americans in Mesoamerica, other groups like the Mixtecs of Oaxaca continue practicing a bride price based marriage. It is typical in Trique culture for a man to offer a bride's family money, food, and other products in exchange for the bride's hand in marriage. Generally, the husband and wife know each other prior to this arrangement and there is no arrangement without consent.Foley, Jack. \\"Experts: Triqui dad in Greenfield followed culture's marriage tradition.\\" The Salinas Californian. January 20, 2009. Retrieved on March 26, 2009. Those opposed to this custom argue that it appears to them to be like slavery or prostitution. Those opposed to intervening in this custom argue that consent is required and that this Triqui custom is not conceived of as immoral.Grillo, Ioan. \\"Selling Brides: Native Mexican Custom or Crime?.\\" Time. Sunday February 1, 2009. Retrieved on February 2, 2009. Agriculture The Triqui economic income comes through the cultivation of various crops such as corn, beans, pumpkin, chili peppers, quelite, and lima beans among others. But the most important crops are both the banana, and the coffee bean. The products are sold in tianguis (open-air markets) found in Chicahuaztla, Copala, San Mart√≠n, Itunyoso, Tlaxiaco, Putla, or Juxtlahuaca. The Triquis practice the slash and burn cultivation system. This work is done by various families (between 20-30 people) in order to plant milpa (corn fields) throughout large terrains. This type of collaborate work is known as ¬´mipa colectiva¬ª or ¬´milpa en compa√±√≠a¬ª Livestock  Another source of income for the Triqui families is the raising of animals. Mainly they raise cattle, bovines, sheep, goats, pigs and horses. On a smaller scale, they also raise chicken, turkey and duck. In the lower lands, they also practice beekeeping. Sports The main sport practiced by the Triqui people is basketball, and as such, a basketball court can be found in all their surrounding communities. Tournaments are held during local festivals where all the athletes participate. The various institutes of education also hold basketball tournaments among all the surrounding schools. Gaining in popularity, although not widely practiced among the Trique is Soccer. The documentary film Gigantes Descalzos chronicles a team of Triqui youth basketball players.

Young paralarvae often resemble other members of the Cranchiidae, having transparent bodies to aid in camouflage. Where the internal organs cannot be made transparent, for example in the digestive system, visceral photophores can be found. These visceral photophores are unique to this genus within the family. The paralarvae also have a thick gelatinous dermis covering the mantle, which again is unique to the Megalocranchia within the family.

It enables safe access to the top of high voltage transmission towers for power line technicians. These towers range in height from 50 feet to over 350 feet high. Overview The helicopter hovers in very close proximity to the top of the structure. The power line technician transfers from the hovering helicopter to the structure. Various safety procedures are employed during the transfer. The AirStair is a framework that attaches to the undercarriage of the helicopter. It comprises a middle step and a lower step, with two hand rails on each side. Both doors on the pilot's side of the helicopter are removed, as well as the co-pilot seat being removed and replaced with a storage/utility box. The use of an AirStair-equipped helicopter removes the need to access a tower from the ground. This has many advantages, as ground access often requires off-road travel across difficult terrain (mountains, rivers, farm crops, etc.). Furthermore, aerial access limits the amount of climbing required, with its inherent potential for fatigue and injury. With no land vehicles required, significant financial gains can be realized, as well as further safety increases due to the hazards of traveling by off-road vehicles being eliminated.

History In 1531 by Diego de Ordaz mentioned the indigenous village there, with the name 'Cabritu'. In 1556, Martin Lopez mentioned that it was an Arawak village with the name 'Caburute'. The 17th century saw a number of plans to fortify Cabruta, and in 1643 Juan de Ochoa Gresala y Aguirre was authorized to establish a Spanish port and found a city to be called 'Triunfo de la Cruz y Nueva Cantabria'. However, it was not until 1647 that Miguel de Ochogavia y Jacinto de Carvajal actually arrived, coming down the Apure River, and with the help of chief Maguare began the improvements. Just eleven years later (1658) the Spanish left Cabruta. It wasn't until 1720 that two capuchine missionaries, formerly with the gold-seeking expedition of Marcos de Castro, settled there and their mission was approved in 1722, but then abandoned to be taken up by the Jesuit Bernardo Rotella in 1733.  Economy  There was a fish processing and freezing center in Cabruta, which closed in 1998. Cotton is grown in the surrounding area and a textile processing plant has been proposed. The Venezuelan government has also proposed building an oil refinery there.  Geographic site  Cabruta is located near the geographical center of Venezuela. This was one of the reasons that proposals were made for constructing a planned city as a new capital for Venezuela near Cabruta. These proposals were made and abandoned in the 1970s.

The other named species Liguriella pardus, which was described by S. Stillman Berry in 1916, is cited as a taxon inquirendum but it is suggested that there may be in fact more than one species and there are species yet to be described. Description Liguriella podophthalma is a moderate sized squid, attaining a mantle length of at least 243mm. The tentacles have a tentacular club which only have suckers, there is no carpal cluster and the stalks have two rows of suckers and knobs. The funnel has no valve and the funnel organ has a dorsal pad which has three papillae. There are tubercles at the join of the funnel and the mantle. The fins are inserted posterior at the distal end of the gladius and only the anterior edge of the fins is not so inserted into the gladius. The eye contains two photophores which run together and there are no photophores on the arms. The contiguous photophores on the eyes are unusual within the Cranchiidae and are only shared with Sandalops. Distribution Liguriella podophthalma occurs around the world where it can be found in the tropical, subtropical and northern sub-Antarctic waters of the oceans. Habitat and ecology The overall vertical distribution of Liguriella podophthalma extends from just below the surface to depths of over 1000m to 1500m. The paralarvae and juveniles of less than 40mm mantle length occur in the upper water colomn to 400m. As they mature they migrate to progressively greater depths, an ontogenetic descent, and this reaches to about 1500 m, the depth at which the largest individual collected to date was recorded, it had a mantle length of 243mm and was a subadult.

Bicket was educated at Radley College, Christ Church, Oxford, where he was an organ scholar, and the Royal College of Music. Before Oxford, he was an organ scholar at St George's Chapel, Windsor. Afterwards, he was sub-organist at Westminster Abbey, during which time he performed at the wedding of Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew. He first performed on the harpsichord in 1983 at The Proms as an emergency deputy, his first-ever public performance on harpsichord. As a conductor, Bicket became known when he stood in as a replacement to conduct Peter Sellars' production of Handel's opera Theodora with Dawn Upshaw, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson and David Daniels, at the Glyndebourne Festival in 1996. In 2003, Bicket made his Covent Garden debut conducting Handel's Orlando with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (OAE). In 2004, Bicket made his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in a production of Rodelinda with Ren√©e Fleming in the title role. He returned to Handel and the Met in 2020, conducting a production new to that house of Agrippina. In October 2006, Bicket was named music director of The English Concert, and formally assumed the post in September 2007, his first orchestral directorship.

As a non-collecting museum, it strives to provide a forum for visual arts of the present and recent past and document new directions in art, while engaging the public and encouraging a greater understanding of contemporary art through education programs. The Contemporary Arts Museum occupies a building designed by Gunnar Birkerts and opened its doors in 1972. History Beginning In 1948, a group of seven Houston citizens founded the Contemporary Arts Museum with the goal of presenting new art to the community and to document arts role in modern life through exhibitions, lectures and other activities. The Museum initially presented exhibitions at various locations throughout the city, sometimes using The Museum of Fine Arts. These first presentations included \\"This is Contemporary Art\\" and \\"L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy: Memorial Exhibition.\\" By 1950, the success of these efforts allowed the Museum to build of a small, professionally equipped facility where ambitious exhibitions of the work of Vincent van Gogh, Joan Mir√≥, Alexander Calder, Max Ernst, and John T. Biggers and his students from the then-fledgling Texas Negro College (now Texas Southern University). Houstonians were receptive to new ideas. Going pro Another major change occurred in 1957, when the previously all-volunteer Museum hired Jermayne MacAgy as its first professional director. Ms. MacAgy wasted no time and soon organized several definitive exhibitions, including \\"The Sphere of Mondrian,\\" \\"The Disquieting Muse: Surrealism,\\" \\"Totems Not Taboo: Primitive Art\\" and Mark Rothko's second museum exhibition. During the 1960s the Museum continued its dedication to thematic exhibitions, architecture and design, and studies individual artists. Landmark exhibitions included \\"The Emerging Figure\\" and the influential combine paintings of Robert Rauschenberg. By the end of the decade, the Contemporary Arts Museum had outgrown the original 1950 facility, so the trustees raised funds to purchase a prominent site on the corner of Montrose and Bissonnet, where the new building, designed by Gunnar Birkerts, was built. In 1972, the present building opened with a controversial exhibition called Ten, featuring several artists working in non-traditional media. The Museum continued to showcase new national and regional art, throughout the 1970s, including such presentations as John Chamberlain, Dal√© Gas (one of the first surveys of Hispanic artists in the U.S.), and a major thematic exhibition, American Narrative/Story Art. In addition, exhibitions of new Texas talent provided early venues for works of James Surls, John Alexander, and Luis Jimenez, among others. Continued growth In the 1980s, the Museum grew significantly, extending its sphere of influence with exhibitions that presented and toured surveys of installations for performance art; contemporary still-life painting; a group exhibition of work by Texas artists; and single-artist shows of artists like Ida Applebroog, Robert Morris, Pat Steir, Bill Viola and Frank Stella, as well as Texans Earl Staley, Melissa Miller and Vernon Fisher. In addition, Director Linda L. Cathcart established Perspectives in the Museum's lower gallery‚Äîa fast-paced series of exhibitions focusing on cycles of work by emerging and well-known artists that had not previously shown in Houston. As of 2011, over 175 exhibitions have taken place within the innovative series. In the 1990s, the Museum adjusted its focus to concentrate only on art made created within the past 40 years. It also worked to extend its reach internationally. Major single-artist exhibitions at the end of the 20th century included Art Guys: Think Twice, Tony Cragg: Sculpture, Ann Hamilton: kaph, Richard Long: Circles Cycles Mud Stone, Nic Nicosia: Real Pictures, Introjection: Tony Oursler: 1976-1999, Lari Pittman, Robert Rauschenberg: A Retrospective, James Turrell: Spirit and Light, William Wegman: Paintings and Drawings, Photographs and Videotapes and Robert Wilson's Vision. Modern museum The Museum temporarily closed on January 1, 1997 for the building's first major renovation in 25 years. The Museum reopened to the public on May 10, 1997 with the presentation of \\"Finders/Keepers.\\" This exhibition documented the institution's relationship with its community and friends, borrowing important works of art back from private collectors that had remained in the region after first being presented at the Contemporary Arts Museum. Other important presentations since have included \\"Elvis + Marilyn: Two Times Immortal,\\" \\"Abstract Painting Once Removed\\" and \\"Other Narratives.\\" As the new millennium began, the Museum celebrated the change with a look back at some of the exhibitions of the previous decade in \\"Outbound: Passages from the Nineties.\\" Other exhibitions of the fledgling century have included \\"Afterimage: Drawing Through Process\\", \\"Subject Plural\\" and \\"The Inward Eye.\\" Single-artist shows have focused on a variety of media and have included \\"When One is Two: The Art of Alighiero e Boetti,\\" William Kentridge, Uta Barth, and Juan Mu√±oz.

He won the 1942 Carnegie Medal for British children's books. Early life Denys Watkins-Pitchford was born in Lamport, Northamptonshire, the second son of the Revd. Walter Watkins-Pitchford and his wife, Edith. His elder brother, Engel, died at the age of thirteen. Denys was himself considered to be delicate as a child, and because of this was educated at home, while his younger twin, Roger, was sent away to school. He spent a great deal of time on his own, wandering through the fields, and developed a love of the outdoors, which was to influence his writing. He enjoyed shooting, fishing and drawing; all these things were to influence his writing greatly. At the age of fifteen, he left home and went to study at the Northampton School of Art. He won several prizes while there, but was irked by the dry, academic approach, and longed to be able to draw from life. While at the Northampton School of Art, Watkins-Pitchford won a travelling scholarship to Paris. He was later to say that he could not remember how long he had spent in Paris, but QuinnTom Quinn, \\"BB Remembered\\", Swan Hill Press, 2006. suggests that it was probably about three months. He worked at a studio in Montparnasse, and attended drawing classes. It is unknown exactly where he studied. In the autumn of 1924, he entered the Royal College of Art in London. In 1930 he became an assistant art master at Rugby School where he remained for seventeen years. While at Rugby School he began contributing regularly to the Shooting Times and started his careers as an author and an illustrator. He wrote under the nom de plume of '\\"BB\\"', a name based on the size of lead shot he used to shoot geese, but he maintained the use of his real name as that of the illustrator in all his books. He later illustrated books by other writers, and sold his own paintings locally. Later years Watkins-Pitchford married in 1939, and had two children, Robin, who died at the age of seven from Bright's Disease, and Angela. Tragedy entered his life a second time in 1974, when his wife, Cecily, became unwell after working in the garden while a farmer was spraying his fields at the other side of the hedge. She died a few weeks later. By the late 1980s, Watkins-Pitchford needed regular dialysis treatment. He was awarded an honorary MA by Leicester University in 1986, and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1990. He collapsed suddenly in September of that year, and died while under anaesthetic in the operating theatre.

This quote, so apt for his works, has sometimes been thought to have been another one of 'BB'‚Äôs creations but it was in fact copied from a tombstone in a north-country churchyard by his father. Adaptations of his works In 1975 The Little Grey Men was adapted into a 10 part animated series called Baldmoney, Sneezewort, Dodder and Cloudberry by Anglia Television in the U.K. Brendon Chase was dramatised into a 13-part series by Southern Television in 1980. In 1970, the Swiss public TV station SRG SSR adapted Bill Badger and the Pirates into an 18 part marionette children's program entitled Dominik Dachs und die Katzenpiraten, in Swiss- German dialect. It was rebroadcast in March 2012.

Description The mantle of Egea inermis is shaped like a spindle, is approximately three times the length of the long and thin fins, and is made up of thin walls. Furthermore, the funnel is quite large and the species includes both a funnel organ and a developed valve. The head in contrast is small in size and includes two big eyes protruding toward the anterior. Both the head and the mantle are connected by a short neck, which therefore constricts the head. Moreover, the arms are short yet strong and include two rows of relatively large suckers. Overall, the best indications that an organism of this species is maturing into an adult are the fins increasing in length, the head and mantle experiencing changes, and the sexual organs developing. Egea inermis is bioluminescent.  Geographical Distribution  Egea inermis is found in both the sub-tropical and tropical Atlantic waters. This species are mostly found close to land, are scattered throughout the open water in the oceans, and follow warm water currents.

The Cathedral is located at what is popularly called \\"Jesus Junction\\" on Peachtree Road, between East Wesley Way and Peachtree Way, in Atlanta's uptown Buckhead district. At present, the parish is one of the ten largest congregations in the United States with over 5,500 families. Christ the King School also occupies the property, with an enrollment of approximately 600 students. History The parish of Christ the King was established in 1936. The congregation purchased approximately four acres of land for $35,000 and held early masses in the mansion that occupied the site. To construct the current cathedral, the parish demolished this structure and purchased adjacent land from the Ku Klux Klan which previously served as its headquarters. Architect Henry D. Dagit, Jr., designed the sanctuary in the Gothic Revival (French Neo-Gothic) style with touches of Art Deco in the interior, especially on the stone reredos. The stained glass windows (restored in 2015-16 by Daprato Rigali Studios) were originally works of the Willet Stained Glass Studios of Philadelphia. A 1939 issue of Architectural Record called it the \\"Most Beautiful Building in Atlanta\\". On January 5, 1937, when Pope Pius XI proclaimed that the Diocese of Savannah, organized in 1850, would now be known as the Diocese of Savannah-Atlanta. Christ the King parish became the Co- Cathedral with the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Savannah. On July 2, 1956, Pope Pius XII split the Savannah-Atlanta Diocese to create the Diocese of Atlanta. The Co-Cathedral became cathedral of the new diocese and Francis E. Hyland became its first Bishop. Construction of the school also began in 1936 and it opened October 31, 1937, under the administration of the Grey Nuns of the Sacred Heart with a blessing by Savannah Bishop Gerald O'Hara.

Life and playing career Born in Bootle, Liverpool, Merseyside, England, local lad Wadsworth played for Lingdale and Ormskirk before being signed, as an amateur, by Liverpool manager Tom Watson, on 23 April 1912, he was to make his debut on 20 March 1915 in a First Division fixture at Ayresome Park against Middlesbrough, the game ended badly for the Reds as they slumped to a heavy 3‚Äì0 defeat. He didn't manage to score his first Liverpool goal until 28 August 1920, this was mainly due to the First World War, it came in a match at Anfield against Man City, more happily for Wadsworth, Liverpool won the match 4‚Äì2. Although the Great War interrupted Wadsworth's career, the uncompromising centre-half did play for Liverpool during this spell in the Lancashire tournament that was set up along with the other 3 regional tournaments. Upon returning to Liverpool after the conclusion of the war, Walter had a strong season playing in 33 of Liverpool's league fixtures, he was joined during this spell by his brother Harold, unfortunately, Harold never had the same impact on the club that Walter had and only made just over 50 sporadic appearances in five years. Walter was a major player in the back-to-back championship winning seasons, missing just 10 of the 84 leagues games available. He remained a stalwart of the side for the next two campaigns but towards the end of the 1924‚Äì25 season, David Pratt replaced him in the starting line-up.

Description Christian praxis is something that goes beyond practices, actions, or behaviors. Praxis is described as a combination of reflection and action that realizes the historicity of human persons. In this sense actions are realized in light of the way they affect history. History has to be seen as a whole, combining in an incarnational way, our salvation history and our \\"human\\" history.Jon Sobrino, \\"Communion, Conflict and Ecclesial Solidarity,\\" Mysterium Liberationis (1993): 616. Expression Most liberation theologians see Christian theological praxis mainly as lived and expressed in the life of community. \\"Any discourse of faith starts from, and takes its bearings from, the Christian life of Community\\".Gustavo Gutierrez, We drink from our own wells (Maryknoll/ Melbourne: Orbis Books/ Dove Communications, 1984), 37-8. This is where a community is said to become an expression of the presence of the Kingdom of God, so long as it is being true to its calling to Christian praxis. This has been the vision shared by the basic ecclesial communities,Marcelo Azevedo, \\"Basic Ecclesial Communities, \\"Mysterium Liberationis (1993): 650. which follow a pattern of Christian praxis based on what Gustavo Gutierrez said: \\"To be followers of Jesus requires that [we] walk with and be committed to the poor; when [we] do, [we] experience an encounter with the Lord who is simultaneously revealed and hidden in the faces of the poor\\".

It plays in the second division Serie A2 as of the 2015-16 season. For past club sponsorship names, see sponsorship names. History Associazione Sportiva Pallacanestro Biella was formed in 1994 from the merger of two local sides, Biella Basket Club and Amici del Basket Biella. It started playing in the Italian fourth division, moving up to the second division by 1999. A team coached by Marco Crespi and containing players like Corey Brewer (basketball, born 1975) and Antonio Granger helped Biella reach the first division Serie A in 2001 (thirty years after another Biella side, Libertas, had been relegated). The team had lower mid-table finishes the next three years to stay in the league before the arrival of Angelico as a main sponsor gave the club a new dimension. It reached the Serie A playoff quarterfinals in 2006 and finished sixth the next season to earn its second playoff run. The 2008-09 season saw the club do one better, beating upsetting Lottomatica Roma in the quarterfinals to reach the semifinals for the first time. Though they lost in the semifinals, it was enough to allow the club to play in Europe for the first time, in the second tier Eurocup. After flirting with the relegation spots the next two seasons and mid-table finish in 2011-12, Biella's twelve- year tenure in the top flight was ended with the club's relegation at the end of the 2012-13 season when it placed last. Though it has stayed in the second division since (as of the 2015-16 season), Biella won their first trophy in 2014, with the second division cup filed in the trophy cabinet. The cup win was enough to earn Biella a place in the 2014‚Äì15 EuroChallenge despite being the only second division side in the competition.

However, obsolescence refers to a lack of availability due to statutory or process changes and new designs, whereas DMSMS is a lack of sources or materials. Impact Although it is not strictly limited to electronic systems much of the effort regarding DMSMS deals with electronic components that have a relatively short lifetime. Causes Primary components DMSMS is a multifaceted problem because there are at least three main components that need to be considered. First, a primary concern is the ongoing improvement in technology. As new products are designed, the technology that was used in their predecessors becomes outdated, making it more difficult to repair the equipment. Second, the mechanical parts may be harder to acquire because fewer are produced as the demand for these parts decreases. Third, the materials required to manufacture a piece of equipment may no longer be readily available. Product life cycle It is widely accepted that all electronic devices are subject to the product life cycle. As products evolve into updated versions, they require parts and technology distinct from their predecessors. However, the earlier versions of the product often still need to be maintained throughout their life cycle. As the new product becomes predominant, there are fewer parts available to fix the earlier versions and the technology becomes outdated. According to EIA-724 there are 6 distinct phases of a product's life cycle: Introduction, Growth, Maturity, Saturation, Decline, and Phase-Out.EIA-724, para. 3.2 To the uninitiated these terms often seem abstract and odd. These terms are often used in databases covering parts life cycle so it is important to have an understanding of what they mean. Although the terms \\"Introduction\\", \\"Growth\\", and \\"Decline\\" are generally accepted without much explanation, the terms \\"Maturity\\", \\"Saturation\\", and \\"Phase-Out\\" are less obvious. \\"Maturity\\" in this case refers to state in the product's life cycle where sales of the product first reach its sales peak and begins to level off. Having survived the Introduction and Growth phases, products in this phase have a low probability of being discontinued. \\"Saturation\\" refers to a state in the product's life cycle where sales have leveled off and, towards the end of this phase, first begin to decline. The term \\"Saturation\\" is confusing to many and can be explained in reference to its equivalent in chemistry where a substance can no longer be dissolved in a liquid. A product can be said to have \\"saturated\\" its market. The decline at the end of the Saturation phase gives the first indications of the products end of life. \\"Phase-out\\" refers to the final stages of a product's decline ending in the product being altogether discontinued by the supplier. Mitigation DMSMS is managed through various risk mitigation efforts, both during the manufacturing of a product as well as later in the products life cycle. DMSMS is a hot topic in military supply where the usable lifetime of an electronic system may far exceed the availability of the components used to produce that system.Bjoern Bartels, Ulrich Ermel, Peter Sandborn and Michael G. Pecht (2012). Strategies to the Prediction, Mitigation and Management of Product Obsolescence, 1st. Ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey. . Devices in phases 5 and 6 of a product's life cycle require caution on the part of designers and product support engineers to assure that system components are indeed available at the time of production. Some examples of the signs and symptoms of a DMSMS issue are: * Notification of a part that will be discontinued in the future. * A system that uses a unique part that can only be produced by a single manufacturer. * Dwindling of parts for a system, but no replacements over time. * Planning in a new system design that does not consider future obsolescence problems. * A parts list that contains an end-of-life cycle part before a system has gone into production. The core methodology for DMSMS analysis has been to make direct contact with the supplier of an item. Direct contact takes the form of phone, e-mail or other communication with a competent supplier representative. This is essential in the management of commercial off-the-shelf products and assemblies. The main items of concern in a DMSMS analysis are: * Is the item an active product? * Is the item a good seller (generates good revenue for the company)? * Is the item slated for obsolescence for any reason (e.g. replaced by a newer version)? Monitoring Other methodologies involve subscription to data services which monitor parts lists, known as a Bill of Materials (BOM), for activity on any one part in the user's list. Often both the classic methodology and the data subscription methodology will be used in conjunction to provide a more complete assessment of a part's availability and lifetime. Lifetime buy One strategy used to combat DMS is to buy additional inventory during the production run of a system or part, in quantities sufficient to cover the expected number of failures. This strategy is known as a lifetime buy. An example of this is the many 30- and 40-year-old railway locomotives being run by small operators in the United Kingdom. These operators will often buy more locomotives than they actually require, and keep a number of them stored as a source of spare parts. Take action It is important and responsible to use a DMSMS risk management plan to ensure parts are available when you need them. Long range planning must occur for every key piece of equipment, establishing \\"when\\" and \\"what\\" parts will be replaced or redesigned. Try to foresee potential equipment problems. Consider replacing obsolete parts and equipment. New methods of design engineering allow for the open exchange of parts as technology changes. There are also companies out there giving assistance and consult in seminars and workshops, audits and implementation of effective DMSMS processes.

More than three million people take part, in more than 100 events that take place all over the city and beyond. History The festival began in 1891, when local women decorated carriages, baby buggies and bicycles with live flowers, met in front of the Alamo, and threw flowers at one another, thus inspiring the name \\"Battle of Flowers.\\" Soon, other activities were added to the flower parade, including balls, parties and a carnival.

The Battle of Flowers Parade Association began crowning a Carnival Queen in 1895.Mrs. Willard E. Simpson, Jr., Fiesta San Antonio, Handbook of Texas Online, accessed February 09, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. In 1909, local businessman John Carrington established The Order of the Alamo with the purpose of crowning a queen, a princess and 24 duchesses ‚Äî 12 from San Antonio and 12 from out of town. Coronations of local \\"royalty\\", a carnival and other activities became the forerunners of today's fiesta. In 2016, Fiesta celebrated its 125th birthday with special events and ceremony. There was no Fiesta in 1917‚Äì18, 1942‚Äì45 nor 2020. Events Today, more than 100 local nonprofit groups, members of the Fiesta San Antonio Commission, stage more than 100 events over 17 days with the help of some 75,000 volunteers. Fiesta events include three major parades‚Äîtwo along Broadway and past the Alamo, and a boat parade at the San Antonio River Walk (where the \\"floats\\" actually float). Louisiana cuisine is sold at \\"A Taste of New Orleans\\" in Brackenridge Park, and oysters and other foods are offered at St. Mary's University's Fiesta Oyster Bake. There are music (six performance stages) and cultural events, lasting two days. A Night in Old San Antonio (NIOSA) is a four-evening block party at La Villita downtown. Fiesta in Blue is another annual event, featuring the USAF Band of the West. Two evenings of concerts are put on in downtown San Antonio featuring classical, jazz, and rock/popular music. Music offered includes Tejano, jazz, mariachi, rock, big band, classical, and pop. History events are held at the Pilgrimage to the Alamo or This Hallowed Ground. Sporting events include races, soccer, rugby, and lacrosse. Cornyation is a satirical musical review for adults only. Residents and visitors can get souvenir pins and medals from various dignitaries or from members of the Fiesta royalty. Battle of Flowers and Fiesta Flambeau parades The Battle of Flowers Parade is the oldest Fiesta event and is organized entirely by women. The parade attracts crowds of more than 350,000 on the second Friday of Fiesta. It is the only parade in the U.S. produced entirely by women, all of whom are volunteers. The women, dressed in yellow on parade day and wearing yellow hats, direct operations with the assistance of the Army National Guard. Several school districts within San Antonio treat the day of the Battle of Flowers as a local holiday and consequently don't hold classes. The Fiesta Flambeau Parade starts at sunset on the second Saturday of the festival. Dating from 1948, the parade is illuminated by thousands of lights on the dancers, the band instruments, the horses, the cars, and the floats. An estimated crowd of 600,000 filled the parade route in 2011 to watch the Fiesta Flambeau Parade.

The sponsoring organizations must meet the commission's criteria before receiving approval and being invited to join. The commission is governed by an all-volunteer board of community leaders and representatives from its nonprofit participating member organizations. The group works throughout the year, coordinating the details and day-to-day tasks required to plan the citywide event. The commission also serves as a liaison between its nonprofit members, the local military activities, and the City of San Antonio. City services are essential to the conduct of Fiesta. The commission receives no government funding. Its income comes from corporate partnerships, sales in the Fiesta Store, membership dues, and proceeds from the Fiesta Carnival. Future Fiesta dates: April 15-25, 2021, March 31-April 10, 2022, April 20-30, 2023, April 18-28, 2024, April 24-May 4,2025, April 16-26, 2026, April 15-25, 2027, April 20-30, 2028.

Description Bathothauma lyromma is an atypical glass squid which has very large paralarva which can reach a mantle length of 100mm and has its eyes mounted on a long stalk possesses and a very long brachial pillar. Both these features are reabsorbed as the paralarva matures into a subadult. As an adult it grows to a mantle length of 200mm. The tentacular club only has suckers while the stalk has two rows of suckers and pads at the base and four rows near the club which form an elongated carpal group. The funnel organ has an inverted V-shaped dorsal pad and has no valve. It has almost no tubercles at the fusion of the funnel and the mantle. The small, paddle shaped fins are widely separated and position sub-terminally. There is a photophore on each eye, an unusual feature in the Cranchiidae, shared only with Helicocranchia. Distribution Bathothauma lyromma has an extremely wide oceanic distribution and it occurs in oceans throughout the world in tropical and subtropical regions; in the Atlantic it is known to occur from 35¬∞ to 45¬∞N to 35¬∞ to 40¬∞S. It is, however, absent from the subtropical waters of the south-eastern Atlantic. Biology The long eye-stalked paralarvae of Bathothauma lyromma are plantonic and are found in the upper water column from less than 100m in depth down to 300m. As they age they undergo an ontogenetic vertical migration in which the larger individuals move down into the deeper depths of more than 1,500 m. They become sexually mature and mate at the depths. Taxonomy Bathothauma lyromma is currently regarded as the only species in its monotypic genus but research indicates that there may be as many as four closely related species within the species circumglobal distribution, If this is correct then this species may represent a species complex.

Albinen Tourism maintains an extensive hiking network that offers tracks of different lengths and difficulties. A highlight is the \\"Albinenleitern\\" - a couple of ladders leading over a rock face. In former times this was the main connection between Albinen and Leukerbad. A cable-car connects to the \\"Rinderh√ºtte\\" situated in the mountain area \\"Torrent\\" at 2313 meters above sea level. In winter this is a paradise for skiers, providing over 50 km of runs. In summer Torrent offers a huge network of hiking and mountain bike trails. The panoramic views of the peaks of the Swiss, French and Italian Alps from the Torrent area are breath taking. Old town Historic aerial photograph by Werner Friedli from 1955 Albinen is famous for being one of the best-preserved traditional Swiss mountain villages. Narrow stone alleys run between old larch houses. Many of these homes and sheds are several hundred years old and demonstrate impressively the craft of former generations. After an earthquake has damaged the old church of Albinen the church has been replaced by a relatively modern building. This building is one of the characteristics of Albinen and consorts very well with the old town.

He competed in the AMA Motocross Championships from 1988 to 2006. He is a three-time AMA motocross national champion. Henry was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2005. Early career Henry was born in Milford, Connecticut and grew up on his parents' farm in the White Hills section of Shelton, CT. The rural area with extensive winding dirt roads was conducive to him learning the sport he would master. He attended Shelton High School. Henry had his first major success in 1993 as a member of Team Honda, where he claimed the 125 East Supercross and the 125 National Championship. In 1994, he repeated as champion in the nationals, beating riders such as Steve Lamson and Ryan Hughes while battling a severe stomach ailment. He later appeared on Fox's first motocross movie Terrafirma. He moved to the premier 250cc division for 1995, where he was immediately competitive, winning Supercross mains and outdoor overalls, before a devastating injury at Budds Creek, Maryland ended his season. Henry was slipping off the back of the bike on the face of a hill, inadvertently applying full throttle, launching him off the hill, causing him to fall from nearly 80 feet in the air to flat ground. Henry's back was broken, but he suffered no paralysis. Henry raced Southwick every year to earn national points and keep his trademark national #19. He regularly finished in the top-5 on privateer Yamahas. Comeback Amazingly, Henry fought back and wanted to race again. He slowly worked his way back into shape, and Team Yamaha took a chance on him for the 1996 season. By the end of the Nationals, Henry was winning motos once again and had regained his form. For 1997, Yamaha approached Henry with the idea of riding their prototype YZM400 four-stroke in competition. He accepted the offer. While he raced and led the early part of the 1997 Supercross season on a YZ250, Henry suffered a hand injury that forced him to withdraw during the middle of the series. He came back riding the four-stroke full-time, and posted top-5 finishes at the first few Nationals, which was unprecedented for a four-stroke machine. Henry raced the bike at the final Supercross in Las Vegas, Nevada, and won the race in the prototype bike's first and only start. Tragedy would strike Henry yet again that summer, as he suffered two broken wrists at Budds Creek, mere feet away from the jump where he had his earlier injury. But Henry would battle back again. Henry would race the production version of the prototype four- stroke, the YZ400F, for 1998. This is the machine that started the four-stroke revolution in motocross. He battled through a strong but unspectacular supercross season where he finished 7th overall. The outdoor season would be Henry's chance to show the bike's true capabilities. After a win at his home track of Southwick, Henry followed up with a triumphant win in Budds Creek, the track where he broke his arms and back. He would go on to defeat Jeff Emig, Jeremy McGrath, Ezra Lusk, Kevin Windham, Mickael Pichon, and Greg Albertyn, earning five overall wins in one of the most competitive seasons ever to take the 1998 250cc National Championship at Broome Tioga Sports Center. He accomplished this with one whole round left. Having accomplished all his goals, Henry scaled back to a partial schedule for 1999, where he dabbled in snocross for the winter. He returned to the nationals in a farewell tour wearing his #1 plate. He started slowly after taking the winter off, but still managed to score overall wins by mid-season. Henry had been a regular on the AMA Supermoto tour, winning many National events. He gained national attention once again by winning the gold medal in the 2005 X-Games Supermoto race. Henry also won a 2005 Grand National Cross Country enduro race in his first attempt on a stock Honda 450. He followed that with a bronze in 2006. Semi-Retirement & Subsequent Injury Henry broke his back on March 4, 2007, in a Supermoto race.Doug Henry Benefit Auction at Southwick; motorcycleusa.com; June 4, 2007 He now suffers partial paralysis from the waist down, and is working very hard toward yet another recovery. Henry was filmed on September 14, 2009 riding a custom YZ450F and a custom FX Nytro during winter.http://vimeo.com/6875050 Henry raced at Winter X-Games 14, in the \\"Adaptive Snowmobile\\" class.

He served as Minister of Justice from 1993 to 1998 and President of the Supreme People's Court from 1998 to 2008. His tenure as China's Chief Justice was marked by the implementation of major reforms. A key reform was his restoration of the Supreme Court's right of final review for capital punishment cases, which resulted in a sharp reduction in the number of executions in China after 2006. Another of his reforms was to professionalize the rank of judges by requiring most new judges to pass the National Judicial Examination. He also advocated judicial independence in the country, but was ultimately unsuccessful.  Early life  Xiao was born in August 1938 in Heyuan, Guangdong, China. He entered the Department of Law of the Renmin University of China in 1957 and graduated in 1962.  Career   Guangdong  In 1962, Xiao taught at the Political Science and Law School of Xinjiang for a few months before returning to his home province of Guangdong to work in the government of Qujiang County of Shaoguan. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1966. Xiao served as Party Committee Secretary of Wujiang District, Shaoguan from 1981 to 1983. He became deputy procurator-general of Guangdong Province in 1983, and was promoted to procurator-general in 1986. In that capacity, he reformed Guangdong's judiciary system and created China's first anti-corruption bureau in the province. He also established a center for economic crimes in Shenzhen.  Deputy Procurator-general and Minister of Justice  In 1990, Xiao was transferred to the national government to serve as deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate. Three years later, he was appointed Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Li Peng. He initiated a number of reforms, including the establishment of a legal aid system in China. He also promoted the rule of law, which was officially adopted in 1997 as a governing principle by the Communist Party.  Reforms as Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court  In March 1998, Xiao was elected President (Chief Justice) of the Supreme People's Court, succeeding Ren Jianxin. He was re-elected in March 2003 for a second term. Starting in 1999, he initiated a series of reforms, the most important being the restoration of the Supreme Court's right of review for capital punishment. In the 1980s, the National People's Congress had passed legislation to grant provincial high courts the final say in death-penalty cases. Provincial judges, many of whom were former police or military officers without formal legal training, often imposed overly harsh punishments. This resulted in high numbers of executions, including some that later proved to be wrongful. Xiao's proposal to reduce executions met significant opposition, as capital punishment enjoyed wide support both within the government and among the general public in China. One of Xiao's tactics was to encourage the use of death sentence with reprieve (which is typically commuted to life sentence) as an alternative to death sentence. He also seized upon the signature rhetoric, \\"Harmonious Society\\", of then-President Hu Jintao, and argued that a harmonious society called for fewer executions. In 2006, he won a key change in the law that restored the Supreme Court's right of final review for death penalty. With the implementation of Xiao's reform in 2007, the number of death sentences plunged by 30% in that year, and many cases were sent back to provincial courts for retrial. The number of executions in China has been further reduced since then, by half to two-thirds in some provinces as of 2019, compared with before the reform. Another reform by Xiao was to professionalize China's rank of judges, who were formerly appointed like normal politicians, with little regard to their education and experience in law. Xiao's efforts resulted in the National Congress amending the Judges Law in 2001 to require all new judges to pass the National Judicial Examination. Except for presidents of the courts, who remain political appointees, all other judges are henceforth required to have legal qualifications. Other reforms implemented by Xiao include opening most trials to the general public (since 1998), and some trials were even televised. He also advocated but failed to make the court independent from political influence. Despite his efforts, the Communist Party retains absolute control of China's judicial system, and after his retirement in 2008, none of his successors have advocated judicial independence again. Xiao was a member of the 15th and the 16th Central Committees of the Communist Party of China.  Death  Xiao died of an illness in Beijing on 19 April 2019, at the age of 80 (81 in East Asian age reckoning).

J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen-Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 Synopsis Jack is Samuel Crow's nephew, whom he threw out of his house many years ago, and who (unbeknown to his uncle) has been brought up by the latter's friend Mr. Daw. Daw has just died and has asked Crow to look after his frumpish daughter Marjorie. Crow lives with his niece Jenny, Jack's cousin, with whom he is in love, but from whom he has concealed his true identity. Jack turns up incognito at his uncle's house on the Thames to hatch a plot to gain Crow's consent to the marriage. When Marjorie arrives, Jenny mistakes her for a flame of Jack's. Eventually, in a rage at Jenny's determination to marry this unknown man, Crow decides to leave all his money not to her, but to his nephew, Jack, whom he thinks he has not seen for many years.
