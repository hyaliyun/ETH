The company strives to double local food production, decrease reliance on imported fossil fuel by 70 percent by the year 2030 and decrease waste by 30 to 40 percent. eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife Pam established Ulupono Initiative in 2009 based on their conviction that every person has the power to make a difference. After each spent parts of their childhood in Hawai‚Äòi, they returned to live there and saw an opportunity to make values- driven community investments and contributions that would sustain the land and stimulate the economy.

The company collaborates with likeminded organizations to advocate for policies that will make a meaningful impact in Hawaii. Most notably, Ulupono Initiative was a strong advocate of a Hawaii state constitutional amendment to allow farmers, ranchers and owners of other agricultural endeavors to request special purpose revenue bonds (SPRB). The measure passed with 50.2% of the vote in Hawaii's 2014 general election. Ulupono spent $500,000 on the amendment's passage. 2014 Election Summary for Ballot Issue Committees,http://ags.hawaii.gov/campaign/files/2015/01/2014ElectionBallotSummary.pdf Controversies Ulupono Initiative was unsuccessful in starting Hawaii Dairy Farms, a 550 acre diary farm with 699 to 2,000 cows in Mahaulepu, Kauai, six- tenths of a mile upslope from the ocean. The project was opposed by local community groups and the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort and Spa. In 2015, Friends of Mahaulepu sued Hawaii Dairy Farms, alleging violation of the federal Clean Water Act by installing irrigation systems and wells without a stormwater construction permit. Hawaii Dairy Farms was ordered to pay more than half a million dollars in attorney fees and court costs and $125,000 to fund a supplemental environmental project for stream-bank restoration and endangered species protection at Makauwahi Cave Reserve. In June 2016, Hawaii Dairy Farms completed a draft environmental impact statement on the project and submitted it to the state Department of Health in January 2017. In March 2017, the Department of Health wouldn't approve the final Environmental Impact Statement and Hawaii Dairy Farms withdrew the document from consideration. Honolulu- based Ulupono received $875,000 in state tax credits under a 2008 law that created incentives for landowners to preserve prime farmland for agricultural use in perpetuity. Ulupono said in a written statement that it is disappointed that Hawaii Dairy Farms didn‚Äôt succeed but that the tax credit program provided an incentive to take on risk with the project it estimated would cost $17.5 million.No dairy farm, https://www.thegardenisland.com/2019/02/01/hawaii-news/no-dairy-farm/ Hawaii's Taxpayers Take Loss on Failed Kauai Dairy Plan, https://www.dairyherd.com/article/hawaiis-taxpayers-take-loss-failed-kauai- dairy-plan In March 2017, Ulupono Initiative released its Honolulu rail system public-private partnership study that argued the City and County of Honolulu project should be restructured to a public-private partnership. Central to its findings, the P3 analysis concluded that the Honolulu Rail Transit Project remains dependent on public funding to close the $2 billion funding gap. Delays in identifying the funding source could further delay the project, potentially costing the taxpayers of Hawaii close to $114 million per year. The Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation, which was trying to get a handle on the $10 billion Honolulu proposed rail system, hired Ernst and Young Infrastructure Advisors to study whether P3 was a viable option. ‚ÄúRonald Tutor, CEO of Los Angeles-based Tutor Perini Corp. disclosed in a July 29 call with investors that his construction company is part of a team that‚Äôs competing against one other joint venture for rail‚Äôs P3 award. As part of the deal, the team that‚Äôs selected would build rail‚Äôs remaining 4 miles and eight stations into downtown Honolulu. HART has estimated that construction work to cost around $1.4 billion. However, during the call Tutor said his company‚Äôs bid was ‚Äòover $2 billion.‚Äô‚Äù The City and County of Honolulu announced on September 25, 2020 that it is pulling out of the effort to land a private- sector partner to complete construction and operate the 20-mile system during its first 30 years.

The railroad operates between Boyertown in Berks County and Pottstown in Montgomery County. Operations The Colebrookdale Railroad operates a variety of excursions originating out of Boyertown. The trains operated include a fall foliage train, Haunted History train, Santa Claus train, Valentine's Day train, Easter Bunny Express, Wine Tasting and Cheese Train, and Mother's Day and Father's Day trains. The railroad also allows groups to charter the entire train or to rent the caboose for birthday parties. History The inaugural excursion of the Colebrookdale Railroad on October 18, 2014, led by EMD GP10 7580 in Pennsylvania Railroad colors The Colebrookdale Railroad started building the railroad line between Boyertown and Pottstown in 1865 to serve the iron ore industry along the Manatawny Creek and trains started running on September 6, 1869. The line, which featured both freight and passenger service, originally continued further north to Bechtelsville and Barto before service was later cut back to Boyertown. The Colebrookdale Railroad was leased by the Reading Railroad who operated the line until 1976, when it became a part of Conrail. Conrail planned to abandon the line, but the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation acquired the line and hired operators. The line was operated by the Anthracite Railway, the Blue Mountain & Reading Railroad, and Penn Eastern Rail Lines. In March 2001, Berks County acquired the line for $155,000 to keep it active; the line was soon sold to Penn Eastern Rail Lines. The Colebrookdale Spur was abandoned by the East Penn Railroad (the successor to Penn Eastern Rail Lines) in 2008. The Berks County Redevelopment Authority reactivated the line, with the Eastern Berks Gateway Railroad appointed to operate the line beginning in October 2010. The company's non-profit parent, the Colebrookdale Railroad Preservation Trust, is working on developing freight traffic on the line. In 2011, a tourist railroad was proposed to operate on the line. Tourist passenger operations began in early October 2014 with a series of \\"soft\\" trips, intended to work out any operational issues before the first full season in 2015. The Colebrookdale Railroad began regular tourist service on October 18, 2014. In early 2020 the railroad operators requested $25M from the county government for infrastructure improvements. The rail had to turn away freight business because tracks and bridges needed reinforcement to support the weight of modern railcars.

Several commercial preparations exist, and it can also be made using a food dehydrator. Some celery powders are prepared from celery juice. Meat preservative Celery powder contains a significant amount of naturally occurring nitrate and is often treated with bacterial cultures to produce nitrite. In the United States, treated celery powder is sometimes used as a food preservative in organic meat products, which is allowed per USDA regulations because the nitrate/nitrite is naturally occurring. USDA regulations do not allow artificially added nitrate or nitrite to be used directly in organic food products. Meats preserved with celery powder include hot dogs and bacon. Celery powder prepared from celery juice has been shown to have a nitrate content of approximately 2.75%.

She was the founder and director of The Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and a trustee and active supporter of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. She is commonly referred to as \\"Kippy\\". Personal life Marion Boulton Stroud was born on March 22, 1939, the only child of Dr. Morris Wistar Stroud 3d (1913‚Äì1990), a pioneer in geriatric medicine, and his first wife, Marion Sims Rosengarten (1913‚Äì1988). Boulton Stroud married Clinton Darlington Swingle (1928‚Äì2013) on February 20, 1980, in Nacogdoches County, Texas. Career Boulton Stroud graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a master's degree in art history. After graduating, she took her first job at the Philadelphia Museum of Art as director of art sales and rentals. She roomed with Anne d'Harnoncourt, the institution's future director. Boulton Stroud was artistic director of a community organization, Prints in Progress, teaching silk-screening to inner-city kids from 1971 to 1977. She also founded an international artistic think tank, the Acadia Summer Arts Program (or \\"Kamp Kippy\\") on Mount Desert Island, Maine. The Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia In 1977, Boulton Stroud started The Fabric Workshop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a studio where artists could explore unfamiliar media, particularly fabric arts. Her goal was \\"to explore, to take liberties, to be a studio and laboratory of new design, unhampered by rules and precedents\\". Artists were invited to attend \\"without any preconceived notions of what they had to do\\". In 1978, with the help of curator (and cousin) Patterson Sims, Boulton Stroud hosted 22 artists in two-week residencies. Over time, the length of residencies was extended from two weeks to two years. Those invited included architects, sculptors, painters, and craftspeople. Hundreds of artists have done residencies, including Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, Steven Izenour, Italo Scanga, Cai Guo-Qiang, Red Grooms, Louise Bourgeois, Donald Lipski, Claes Oldenburg, Marina Abramovic, Lorna Simpson, and Bill Viola. The workshop moved from its original 5,000 square foot space at 1133 Arch Street to a 35,000 foot rental at 1315 Cherry Street, and finally to a multi-floor space at 1214 Arch Street. The collection of materials and finished pieces also grew, and in 1996 the workshop was expanded to become The Fabric Workshop and Museum. Boulton Stroud curated exhibitions, lectured nationally, and wrote and edited publications for the Fabric Workshop and Museum. New Material as New Media: The Fabric Workshop and Museum (2002) won the Frances Smyth-Ravenel Prize for Excellence in Publication Design, from the American Association of Museums in 2003. Cai Guo-Qiang: Fallen Blossoms (2010) won the award for Best Project in a Public Space from the International Association of Art Critics. Cai Guo-Qiang's two-venue exhibition at the Fabric Workshop and Museum and the Philadelphia Museum of Art commemorated the friendship between Boulton Stroud and Anne d'Harnoncourt. The two women had invited Guo-Qiang to come to Philadelphia, but d'Harnoncourt died before he could do so. Boulton Stroud's recorded memories of d'Harnoncourt were the inspiration for the creation of a set of woven tapestries, Time Flies Like a Weaving Shuttle; the destruction by fireworks and water of a written Time Scroll; and a public fireworks display. Boulton Stroud was a trustee at the Philadelphia Museum of Art where she served on a number of committees including the 20th Century Art Committee and the African American Art Committee, and chaired the Prints, Drawings, and Photographs Committee. She also worked with the National Endowment of the Arts and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. She was a founding member of the National Committee of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Awards Boulton Stroud was elected to the American Craft Council as an Honorary Fellow in 1988. She was declared one of the \\"Distinguished Daughters of Pennsylvania\\" by Governor Ed Rendell in 2006, and received Maine's Skowhegan Governor's Award, given for \\"outstanding service to art and artists\\". Death Boulton Stroud died on August 22, 2015, in Northeast Harbor, Maine. In 2016, a substantial part of Boulton Stroud's art collection (including four pieces by Georgia O'Keeffe) was offered for sale with proceeds going to the Marion Boulton \\"Kippy\\" Stroud Foundation, for the ongoing support of The Fabric Workshop and Museum. Boulton Stroud's collection contained around 1,500 works of art, including pieces by Georgia O'Keeffe, Henrietta Shore, Marsden Hartley, George Bellows, Arthur Dove, Joseph Stella, and Andy Warhol.

The pass is 418 m above sea level and connects National Road 565 (formerly Route 137) in Vietnam to Route 912 in Khammouane Province in Laos. The pass, together with the M·ª• Gi·∫° Pass was one of the principal entry points into the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Laos. Southwest of the pass in Laos was an area nicknamed \\"the Chokes\\" where several highways from the M·ª• Gi·∫° and Ban Karai passes converged. The CIA stationed roadwatch teams near the pass to monitor Vietnamese supply activities and it became one of the prime targets of Operation Commando Hunt. Despite frequent bombing, the United States Air Force and United States Navy were never able to put the pass out of operation for any sustained period of time. From 19 April to 24 June 1968 the USAF conducted Operation Turnpike, an intensive air interdiction campaign against the M·ª• Gi·∫° and Ban Karai Passes, that included the use of B-52 bombers. In March 1969 USAF UC-123s sprayed defoliants over a four square mile area on an approach road to the pass. During 1968 the area around the pass was defended by numerous machine-guns and smaller calibre (23mm and 37mm) anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). In December 1970 the North Vietnamese stationed SA-2 missiles on the North Vietnamese side of the M·ª• Gi·∫° and Ban Karai Passes. By 1971 given the buildup of large calibre (57mm, 85mm and 100mm) radar-guided AAA and the presence of SA-2s, USAF AC-119 gunships and B-52s no longer operated near the pass. During 1970 the North Vietnamese built a petroleum-oil-lubricants pipeline through the pass.

The three-year programme was signed in May 2011 by the Portuguese Government under then-Prime Minister Jos√© S√≥crates on one hand, and on the other hand by the European Commission on behalf of the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In June 2014, Portugal exited the ‚Ç¨78 billion programme, with a concluding tranche of ‚Ç¨0.4 billion being disbursed in November 2014. Background On 6 April 2011, the resigning Prime Minister Jos√© S√≥crates announced on the television that the country, facing a status of bankruptcy, would request financial assistance to the IMF (at the time managed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn) and the European Financial Stability Facility, like Greece and the Republic of Ireland had done before. Robert Fishman, in the New York Times article \\"Portugal's Unnecessary Bailout\\", points out that Portugal fell victim to successive waves of speculation by pressure from bond traders, rating agencies and speculators. In the first quarter of 2010, before pressure from the markets, Portugal had one of the best rates of economic recovery in the EU. From the perspective of Portugal's industrial orders, exports, entrepreneurial innovation and high- school achievement, the country matched or even surpassed its neighbors in Western Europe. Memorandum of Understanding On 16 May 2011, the eurozone leaders officially approved a bailout package for Portugal, which became the third eurozone country, after Ireland and Greece, to receive emergency funds. The bailout loan was equally split between the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, and the International Monetary Fund. According to the Portuguese finance minister, the average interest rate on the bailout loan is expected to be 5.1 percent. As part of the deal, the country agreed to cut its budget deficit from 9.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.9 percent in 2011, 4.5 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013. In June 2011, Portugal officially requested the ‚Ç¨78 billion IMF-EU bailout package in a bid to stabilise its public finances. To avoid the legislative ratification procedures required for treaties under the international law, the programme was set up as an intergovernmental agreement consisting of: * the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), * the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality (MoU), * and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), the actual Loan Facility Agreement. The agreements were signed in June 2011 by the Portuguese government and the European Commission. Portugal and the IMF also have a long history. Further events In order to accomplish the European Union/IMF-led rescue plan for Portugal's sovereign debt crisis, in July and August 2011 the new government led by Pedro Passos Coelho announced it was going to cut on state spending and increase austerity measures, including public servant wage cuts and additional tax increases. On 6 July 2011, the ratings agency Moody's had cut Portugal's credit rating to junk status, Moody's also launched speculation that Portugal could follow Greece in requesting a second bailout.\\"Portugal's credit rating slashed\\", Business Spectator, 6 July 2011 After the bailout was announced, the Portuguese government headed by Pedro Passos Coelho managed to implement measures to improve the State's financial situation, including tax hikes, a freeze of civil service-related lower-wages and cuts of higher-wages by 14.3%, on top of the government's spending cuts. The Portuguese government also agreed to eliminate its golden share in Portugal Telecom which gave it veto power over vital decisions.Kowsmann, Patricia, \\"Portugal govt ends golden-share holdings\\" (Paid content) , Dow Jones Newswires 5 July 2011. In 2012, all public servants had already seen an average wage cut of 20% relative to their 2010 baseline, with cuts reaching 25% for those earning more than 1,500 euro per month. This led to a flood of specialized technicians and top officials leaving the public service, many looking for better positions in the private sector or in other European countries.Institute of Management Technology Nagpur: \\"Eurocrisis\\", Okonomist, Vol.1, Issue 3, January 2012 In December 2011, it was reported that Portugal's estimated budget deficit of 4.5 percent in 2011 would be substantially lower than expected, due to a one-off transfer of pension funds. The country would therefore meet its 2012 target a year earlier than expected. Despite the fact that the economy is expected to contract by 3 percent in 2011 the IMF expects the country to be able to return to medium and long-term debt sovereign markets by late 2013. Any deficit means increasing the nation's debt. To bring down the debt to sustainable levels will require a 10% budget surplus for several years according to some estimates. In the following months the country started to be seen as moving on the right track. However, the unemployment level rose to over 15 percent in the second quarter 2012 and it was expected to rise even further in the near future.Portugal Q2 Unemployment Rate Rises To Record High, RTTNews (August 14, 2012) On 7 June 2012, Portugal's largest listed bank by assets Millennium bcp was rescued by the Portuguese Government headed by Passos Coelho, through 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in state funds it took from the country's bailout package.Portugal's BCP says to start repaying state funds early, Reuters (7 June 2012) In January 2013, the European Commission approved, under EU state aid rules, a rescuing recapitalisation totalling ‚Ç¨1.1 billion granted by Portugal to Banco Internacional do Funchal S.A. (Banif) for reasons of financial stability.

Essex County Freeholder In 1966, Mintz was elected to the Essex County Board of Chosen Freeholders. Essex County Register of Deeds and Mortgages Following the death of Democratic incumbent Madaline A. Williams in 1968, Mintz became the Republican nominee for Essex County Register of Deeds and Mortgages in 1969 and was elected. He did not seek re-election in 1974; Mintz's Deputy, William L. Stubbs, lost in the Democratic landslide that year. In 1979, Mintz mounted what was widely viewed as a quixotic campaign for County Register against his successor, Democrat Larrie W. Stalks. He ran on a single issue: the elimination of the office to save money. Boosted by the indictment of Democratic Sheriff John F. Cryan, who was defeated for re-election, Mintz came within 800 votes of upsetting Stalks. Family and later life Mintz was married to Beatrice Altshuler Mintz (June 28, 1914 - December 3, 2010) and had two children: Mark Allen and Joan Ellen. They resided in Newark before moving to Livingston, New Jersey. Mintz served as a Trustee of Rutgers Law School and as a Trustee of the Boys Club of America. He later served as President of the Livingston Republican Club. He died in Livingston in November 1986. His daughter, Joan Mintz, served in the administration of Governor Thomas Kean as the Deputy Director of the New Jersey Division on Aging. On August 4, 1987, Beatrice Mintz donated her late husband's collection of historic legal papers to the New Jersey Historical Society. The collection mostly included papers related to civil and criminal cases tried between 1805-1840 in Essex County by many historically prominent lawyers.

It repealed the previous Howard Government's WorkChoices 2005 legislation and started a new series, still in force The Act established Fair Work Australia, later renamed the Fair Work Commission. The related Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 superseded the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (which had in turn superseded the Industrial Relations Act 1988). Collective bargaining Collective bargaining regulates the terms under which employers hire employees and the future treatment of future employees.Sheldon, P. (2008). What collective bargaining future for Australia? Lessons from international experience. In J. Riley and P. Sheldon (eds), Remaking Australian Industrial Relations (pp. 235‚Äì48). Collective bargaining is a mechanism which allows employees, employers and representation parties to express their objectives with respect to work. On 1 July 2010, the new bargaining arrangements under the Fair Work Act became operational.Cooper, R. (2009). The 'New' Industrial Relations and International Economic Crisis: Australia in 2009. Journal of Industrial Relations. Vol. 52, No. 3. pp. 261‚Äì74. Contrary to the individual arrangements that were dominant under the previous Coalition WorkChoices legislation, the new regulations put a stronger emphasis on enterprise based bargaining with the removal of individual Australian Workplace Agreements. The Act continues to outlaw pattern bargaining and removes the distinction between union and non-union agreements. Good-faith bargaining Good-faith bargaining, in which each party 'makes a sincere effort' in negotiations, is at the core of the Act.Cooper, R. & Ellem, B. (2009) 'Fair Work and the Re-regulation of Collective Bargaining', Australian Journal of Labour Law, vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 284‚Äì305. The Act sets out what is meant by good-faith bargaining: attending, and participating in, meetings at reasonable times; disclosing relevant information (other than confidential or commercially sensitive information) in a timely manner; responding to proposals made by other bargaining representatives for the agreement in a timely manner; giving genuine consideration to the proposals of other bargaining representatives for the agreement, and giving reasons for the bargaining representative's responses to those proposals; refraining from capricious or unfair conduct that undermines freedom of association or collective bargaining; and recognizing and bargaining with the other bargaining representatives for the agreement.Fair Work Act 2009, Section 228: Bargaining representatives must meet the good- faith bargaining requirements. www.fwc.gov.au Parties may seek bargaining orders from Fair Work Commission if they believe the other party has failed to comply with these good-faith bargaining obligations. Good-faith bargaining does not require a bargaining representative to make concessions during bargaining for the agreement, nor does it require a bargaining representative to reach agreement on the terms that are to be included in the agreement.  Bargaining orders  According to the Act, if one or more of the bargaining parties does not meet the good-faith requirements, the concerned party should first provide the party allegedly not bargaining in good faith with a written notice setting out those concerns to the relevant bargaining representatives, and a reasonable time within which to respond to those concerns.Fair Work Act 2009, Section 229: Applications for Bargaining Orders. However, Section 229 of the Act states it may not be necessary to comply with the notice requirements should the Fair Work Commission be 'satisfied that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to do so'. If the party does not respond appropriately to the written notice, the Fair Work Commission can make a bargaining order.Fair Work Act 2009, Section 230: When FWA may make a Bargaining Order. Should the relevant party continue to ignore the good-faith requirements following this order, the Fair Work Commission can issue a serious breach declaration.Fair Work Act 2009, Section 235: When FWA may make a Serious Breach Declaration. www.fwc.gov.au If the bargaining representatives have not settled the issue of non-compliance by the end of the post-declaration negotiating period (generally 21 days), the Fair Work Commission can issue a bargaining related workplace determination.Fair Work Act 2009, Section 269: When FWA must make a bargaining related workplace determination.  Bargaining agents  The Act stipulates that employers must take all reasonable steps to notify employees of their right to a bargaining agent not later than 14 days after the notification time of the agreement. The notification time is the time when the employer agrees to bargain or initiates bargaining, when the FWC determines that there is majority support among employees for collective bargaining, or when a scope order (an FWC-issued order to resolve questions about the employees covered by an agreement) comes into operation. The notice must specify that the employee may appoint a bargaining representative to represent the employee in bargaining for the agreement and in a matter before FWC that relates to bargaining for the agreement. An employee organization cannot be a bargaining representative of an employee unless the organization is entitled to represent the industrial interests of the employee. A person may revoke their bargaining agent in writing. Bargaining agents are described in Division 3 of the Fair Work Act 2009,Fair Work Act 2009, Division 3: Bargaining and Representation During Bargaining. and can be the employer, a person the employer appoints in writing, the employee, or a person an employee appoints in writing. If the employee is a member of an employee organization that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of the employee and the employee does not appoint another person as their bargaining representative, the organization will be the bargaining representative of the employee. Instruments for appointing a bargaining representative are also set out in Division 3. An appointment of a bargaining representative comes into force on the day specified in the instrument of appointment. The employer must be given the instrument of appointment of the bargaining agent. For an appointment made by an employer, a copy of the bargaining instrument must be given, on request, to a bargaining representative of an employee who will be covered by the agreement. Mandatory terms Mandatory terms in an enterprise agreement are set out in Division 5 of the Act.Fair Work Act 2009, Division 5: Mandatory Terms of Enterprise Bargaining. Agreements must include a flexibility term, that is, a mechanism for allowing variations in the agreement to meet needs of individual employees while still preserving basic entitlements and protections. They must include the obligation for the employer to consult with covered employees about major workplace changes that are likely to have a significant effect on the employees, and allow for the representation of those employees for the purposes of that consultation. The agreed-on base rate of pay cannot be below that set by the relevant modern award. Equality bargaining According to Colling and Dickens (as cited in Baird, Frino & Williamson, 2009) equality bargaining ‚Äòencompasses the collective negotiation of provisions that are of particular interest or benefit to women and/or are likely to facilitate gender equality‚Äô. Heery (2006, p. 521; as cited in Baird et al., 2009) refers to ‚Äòequality bargaining‚Äô as ‚Äòbending the bargaining agenda to serve the needs of women workers‚Äô.Baird, M., Frino, B. & Williamson, S. (2009) Paid maternity and paternity leave and the emergence of ‚ÄòEquality bargaining‚Äô in Australia: An analysis of Enterprise Agreements, 2003‚Äì2007. Australian Bulletin of Labour. Vol. 35, No. 4. pp. 671‚Äì691. A number of factors have been identified as contributing to female-friendly provisions being included in collective bargaining agreements. These include social forces, the gender of negotiators, union bargaining priorities, managerial support and bargaining structures. Dickens (2000, p. 203; as cited in Baird et al., 2009) found that when women are involved in bargaining, equality agendas tend to be longer, and women also place a higher priority on equality issues than do their male counterparts. Furthermore, when women are involved in the bargaining processes, equality measures are more likely to be included in final collective agreements (Dickens 1998, p. 34). Equality bargaining is important today because of the aging workforce, increased female workforce participation, and the need for retention of workers. Under a deregulated system, equality bargaining suffers and research shows unions rank family policies lowest in terms of their bargaining priorities. Good-faith bargaining (as introduced through the Act) may result in a bargaining climate more conducive to bargaining for parental leave provisions than existed under previous legislation. Additionally, the introduction of a statutory government funded parental leave scheme combined with increased (but unpaid) parental leave entitlements via the National Employment Standards (Div 5, Fair Work Act 2009) has raised the community‚Äôs and union movement‚Äôs consciousness of the matter and is likely to mean that bargaining for improved parental leave will be on union bargaining agendas. Low-paid bargaining stream The low-paid bargaining stream creates an internationally unique stream allowing for multi- employer bargaining among previously award dependent employees. Its aim is to encourage low-paid employees and their employers to engage in enterprise bargaining. The Act highlights a number of differences that the low-paid bargaining stream incorporates from \\"normal\\" bargaining.Fair Work Act 2009, Section 241: Terms of Employment- Objects of this Division Multi-employer bargaining is permitted; the Act allows, in effect, arbitration. FWC will decide, on application, whether particular employees are eligible. A 'low-paid authorisation' covering more than one employer may be made by FWC. The Act also states that in this stream there will be compulsory conferences, including with third parties; good-faith bargaining orders; dispute resolution; and binding determinations. This initiative owes its origins to the debates over the impact of WorkChoices and attempts to deal with the wider problem of endemic low pay.Cooper, R. and Ellem, B. (2009), 'Fair Work and the Re-regulation of Collective Bargaining', Australian Journal of Labour Law, 22 (3), pp. 284‚Äì305.  Implications and conclusions  The Act marked a substantive change in the nature of bargaining arrangements within the Australian industrial relations system. Bargaining will be based collectively at the enterprise level, in contrast to the emphasis on individual agreements, which was encouraged under the Howard government's WorkChoices. At the heart of the new legislation is the principle of 'good-faith bargaining', which outlines the necessary behaviours of bargaining parties in negotiations. Minimum standards The Act reconstitutes the industrial relations safety net. All employees are entitled to the ten National Employment Standards (NES), similar to the five Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standards under WorkChoices. Additional occupation- or industry-specific conditions are protected through the new modern awards. There are 122 of these awards, compared to over 4000 under the previous system. Another change in the National Employment Standards under the Act is the 'Requests for Flexible Working Arrangements'. This NES allows parents or carers of a child under school age, or of a child under 18 with a disability, the right to request a change in working arrangements to assist with the child's care.Fair Work Act 2009, Section 65: Requests for Flexible Working Arrangement\\"] www.fwc.gov.au The streamlining of the award system is one of the most significant aspects of the reforms. The government, motivated by a desire to streamline, simplify, and promote flexibility and productivity, set its goal as creating a new minimum standard that all parties in the employment relationship could understand, instead of the over-complicated system of decades past. Not all commentators agree that the Rudd government struck the right balance between simplification and appropriate protection. Baird and Williamson, for example, argue that the new minimum standards are detrimental to certain groups, particularly women, because the new awards fail to adequately cover women working in social services, call centres and the health sector.Baird, M., Williamson, S., (2009) 'Women, Work and Industrial Relations in 2008', Journal of Industrial Relations, 51(3).  The safety net  Under the National Employment Standards (NES),\\"National Employment Standards\\" . www.tresscox.com.au employees have certain minimum conditions. Together with pay rates in modern awards (which also generally took effect from 1 January 2010) and minimum wage orders, the NES makes up the safety net that cannot be altered to the disadvantage of the employee.\\"National Employment Standards\\". www.fairwork.gov.au There are ten minimum conditions covered under the NES: a maximum number of hours in the working week, requests for flexible working arrangements, parental leave and related entitlements, annual leave, personal or carer's leave and compassionate leave, long service leave, community service leave, public holidays, notice of termination and redundancy pay, and a fair work information statement.Fair Work Information Statement .

She was built in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, laid down on March 16, 1914; launched on June 19, 1915 and commissioned on October 17, 1916. In April 1940, she and the rest of the United States Pacific Fleet were transferred from California to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii as a deterrent to the Empire of Japan. On December 7, 1941, Arizona was among the ships stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii that were attacked by the Japanese Empire's Air Forces. The ship was hit, and exploded and sank, taking with her the lives of 1,177 crewmen and officers. The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor.

He was a member of the Council of Kiryat Arba, 2010-2013. In November 2019, he was indicted on charges of incitement to terrorism, violence and racism. Kahanism Gopstein is a student of Meir Kahane and an adherent of Kahanism, the ideology named for and developed by him and promoted by his banned Kach party in Israel. Kach incited to racism and advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the Palestinian Territories,In the Spotlight: Kach and Kahane Chai Center for Defense Information October 1, 2002 and Gopstein praised the 1994 Cave of the Patriarchs massacre committed by fellow Kach member Baruch Goldstein. He has participated in memorials to Kahane.Schwartz, Yardena (3 March 2018) Israel's Alt-Right is Now Mainstream- Are Lawmakers Doing Enough to Stop It?\\", Newsweek. Retrieved 1 July 2019. Shortly after Kahane's 1990 assassination, Gopstein was arrested, and then released, in a case involving the unsolved murder of an Arab couple. In 1994, Gopstein was assigned to administrative detention as a result of his involvement with Kahane's then-banned organization. In 2015, in a tape- recorded talk, Gopstein justified burning down churches based on the religious teachings against idolatry by 12th-century Jewish philosopher and scholar Maimonides. Later that year, he advocated expelling Christians from Israel and banning celebration of Christmas there. Hemla Gopstein has served as public relations director of Hemla, a publicly funded non-profit. Hemla for many years focused on \\"saving the daughters of Israel\\" from mixed marriages with Arab men, and received up to $175,000 each year from the state between 2005 and 2013. Part of the public funding went to Gopstein's salary. While some considered Hemla to be focused on keeping Jewish women from dating Arab men, Gopstein described the charter of the Hemla in an interview with Haaretz: Lehava Lehava, Hebrew for \\"flame\\" and an acronym for Preventing Assimilation in the Holy Land, is an anti-assimilation organization, dedicated to preventing personal, romantic, or business relationships between Jews and non-Jews, particularly Arabs. Lehava's activities are documented in a recent report titled \\"Racism and Gender in Israel\\" by the Israel Religious Action Center and other groups active against racism. In 2011, Lehava plastered posters in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods of Jerusalem deploring a supermarket chain that employed Palestinians. The slogan of the fliers was, \\"Do you want your grandson to be called Ahmad Ben Sarah?\\" The group began distributing \\"kosher certificates\\" to businesses that did not employ Arabs to encourage discrimination against non-Jews. In 2012, Lehava distributed fliers warning Palestinian men not to date Jewish women. In addition to opposing interfaith and interethnic marriages, and promoting discrimination against Palestinians and Arabs in employment, Lehava also has encouraged Israelis to report to the organization the names of Jews who rent to Palestinians so that they can be named and publicly shamed. A group of anti-racist organizations petitioned Israel's Supreme Court against the state attorney, Lehava, and Gopstein. According to the petition, Gopstein had, in addition to promoting discrimination against Palestinians and other Arabs, praised a group of Jewish youths who attacked Palestinians in Jerusalem, leaving one victim unconscious and hospitalized. The court case is pending. In 2014, three members of Lehava were arrested, and indicted in 2014 for committing arson and spray-painting anti-Arab graffiti at the Max Rayne Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel (Yad B'Yad) Bilingual School in Jerusalem. Gopstein, along with several other group members, was arrested shortly thereafter for incitement. In January 2015, Channel 2 reported that Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon may be preparing to categorize Lehava as a terrorist organization. Ya'alon was reported to have ordered the Shin Bet and the Defense Ministry to assemble evidence required for the classification. The arson incident received international attention. Gopstein issued a statement harshly critical of Ya'alon: A journalist participated in Lehava undercover and reported on Gopstein's leadership. Liat Bar-Stav described a meeting that Gopstein led for his followers, in which he said to them: As the crowd responded with booing and cheering, Gopstein continued: Before his Facebook account was permanently disabled, it had doctored images of Arab Israeli Knesset members who appear to be hung by the neck. Advocacy outside Israel Gopstein wrote a letter to Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg protesting both Zuckerberg's marriage to a non-Jewish woman, as well as the Palestinian use of Facebook. He complained, \\"In Israel, too, assimilation is hitting us quite a bit because of your Facebook, where every Mohammed is 'CitySlicker' and every Yusuf calls himself 'Prince Charming'\\". In 2018, Gopstein started a fund raiser to raise money to sue Facebook for censorship. Attitude towards Christians Gopstein has called for the incineration of Christian churches. The discussion centered on whether Maimonides's ruling to eliminate idol worship was valid also for modern times.Chaim Levinson, 'Israeli Extremist Group Leader Calls for Torching of Churches', Haaretz 6 August 2015. On the Haredi website Kooker, Gopstein published an article in December 2015 calling for the suppression of Christmas celebrations in Israel and the expulsion of Christians, whom he likened to vampires. Calling the Christian Church \\"the deadly enemy of the Jewish people for centuries\\", he claimed, \\"Their missionaries prowl for prey in Jerusalem.\\" In response, Israeli groups have asked he be investigated for incitement. Reactions In 2016, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) sent a letter to the Israeli government encouraging action to be taken to curb Gopstein. In the letter to Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, the ADL said that Gopstein has referred to Christians as \\"bloodsucking vampires\\", condoned burning Christian churches, and that his Facebook page includes anti-LGBT posts, as well as ones the ADL calls \\"extremely abusive, racist, inflammatory, and violent\\".In First, ADL Urges Clampdown on Extremist Israeli Group Lehava Haaretz, May 26, 2015 The Reform Center for Religion and Policy petitioned Mandelblit again in 2018. During a hearing however, the petition was withdrawn by suggestion of multiple Supreme Court justices.

In the summer of 1999, during a camp held by Ron Fournier, he told R√©seau des Sports that his goal was to make it to the NHL. Said to have \\"an exceptional talent\\", he became a Level VI referee in the Hockey Canada Officiating Program during a seminar in November 2001, held in Halifax, Nova Scotia. After wearing sweater number 38 since joining the league full-time in the 2009-10 NHL season (carrying it over from the American Hockey League after six seasons), St- Laurent changed to sweater number 8 in the 2019-20 NHL season. Officiating career Pre-junior league In 1998 and 1999, St-Laurent worked the Coupe Dodge championship. He also participated in the 2000 Air Canada Cup, held in Montreal, Quebec. Juniors to professional career Quebec Major Junior Hockey League St-Laurent joined the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in 1999, working 30 regular-season games and seven playoff games as a linesman. His first game in the league was on 10 September 1999, when he worked a game between the Val-d'Or Foreurs and Rouyn-Noranda Huskies. In the 2000-2001 season, he transitioned to a referee; the first regular-season game he worked as a referee came on 22 September 2000, as he worked the game between the Shawinigan Cataractes and Drummondville Voltigeurs. It would be the first of 115 regular-season games he worked between the 00-01 and 02-03 seasons. St- Laurent would also work in 24 playoff games. He worked the President's Cup finals in both 2002 and 2003. He worked the 2002 Memorial Cup, including the final game between the Victoriaville Tigres of the QMJHL and the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League. In March 2019, TVA personality (and former official) St√©phane Auger created a list of the league's top fifty officials throughout its then-fifty year history. For the list, only former QMJHL officials were considered; nobody on the current roster was named. Auger, listing his choices by region, named St-Laurent as one of the league's best officials. American Hockey League As he began to work games in the QMJHL, St-Laurent was hired by the American Hockey League as a linesman for the 1999-00 AHL season. His first regular-season game in the AHL came on 22 November 1999, as the St. John's Maple Leafs faced off against the Quebec Citadelles. He spent four years working the lines in the AHL before he was hired by the NHL as a referee. While Quebec would be his home base, he would also work games in Ontario (Hamilton Bulldogs), New Brunswick (Saint John Flames), and Newfoundland (St. John's); all three of which came in the 2002-03 AHL season.St-Laurent working an AHL game in 2009 His first regular-season AHL game as a newly-hired referee came on 11 October 2003, in a game between the Providence Bruins and Worcester IceCats. During his stint in the AHL, St- Laurent worked the Calder Cup finals in 2008 and 2009. He also worked the AHL All-Star Classic in 2009, held in Worcester, Massachusetts. During the 2015-16 AHL season, St-Laurent worked two games in the month of January, marking his first games in the league since the summer of 2009. The games were what appeared to be part of a rehabilitation assignment. He had missed two and a half months due to an unknown reason, and returned to the NHL in February 2016. National Hockey League St-Laurent was hired by the National Hockey League in the fall of 2003, as one of six officials signed that year. The number he had been assigned was in use by referee Craig Spada. Although he was hired in 2003, St-Laurent did not work in the NHL that season. Due to the 2004-05 NHL lockout, his first regular-season National Hockey League game came on 10 November 2005, in a game between the Ottawa Senators and Boston Bruins. He worked in ten other games that season, bouncing back and forth between the NHL and the American Hockey League. After working in 66 regular-season games over the course of four seasons, he would make the jump to the NHL officiating roster full-time at the start of the 2009-10 NHL season. His first game as a full-time official came on 2 October 2009, in a game between the New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins. In October 2011, then-Director of Officiating Terry Gregson was asked to briefly assess St-Laurent, among other officials in the NHL at the time. Gregson said that St-Laurent was one of the \\"very good young referees\\" at the time of the evaluation. =Stanley Cup playoffs= After working in the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs as a standby in select first round games, St-Laurent was named to the main playoff roster each year since, as part of the first round's twenty officials in ten straight postseasons. He has made the second round four times in his career, picking up on-ice assignments for games between 2017 and 2020. =All-Star Game= St- Laurent worked the 2020 NHL All-Star Game, held at Enterprise Center in St. Louis, Missouri on 25 January. He also helped work the Skills competition the night before, along with referee Justin St. Pierre and linesmen Michel Cormier and Bryan Pancich. Notable games Coyotes/Canadiens, 05-06 season At the end of the 13 December 2005 game between the Phoenix Coyotes and Montreal Canadiens, Phoenix's Shane Doan received a gross misconduct for his comments towards St-Laurent and the other officials who worked the game. After the game, a report was sent to the league, stating that Doan had called the officials \\"fucking Frenchmen\\". Doan denied the comments. The NHL, after going over the allegations, found no evidence that he had used slurs to describe the officials; all four of which were French-Canadian. It was the last time a gross misconduct was given out in the National Hockey League, as the rule was removed from the book after the 2006-07 season. Sharks/Bruins, 05-06 season In a game between the San Jose Sharks and Boston Bruins, played on 10 January 2006, San Jose's Joe Thornton received a major penalty for checking Boston's Hal Gill and a game misconduct. The game was Thornton's first game back in Boston after a trade between the two teams earlier in the 2005-06 season. St-Laurent and partner referee Chris Rooney issued the penalties five minutes into the first period. Rooney commented on the hit after the game, saying that Gill was defenseless at the time of the hit. Predators/Sharks, 06-07 season Early in the third period of a game between the Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks, played on 9 December 2006, St-Laurent sustained an injury to his knee. The injury was later revealed to be a torn knee ligament, which would keep him from working NHL games until late-January (although he would work AHL games two weeks before that time). Capitals/Flyers line brawl, 13-14 season St-Laurent worked a game between the Washington Capitals and the Philadelphia Flyers on 1 November 2013. After a third period goal scored by Washington's Joel Ward, a fight broke out between Capitals player Tom Wilson and Flyers player Wayne Simmonds. As the fight was taking place, Flyers goaltender Ray Emery skated down the ice to challenge Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby, which Holtby declined. When Emery said \\"just protect yourself\\", St-Laurent attempted to stop the fight, but couldn't when Emery began to punch Holtby. St-Laurent stopped various Capitals players from jumping in to stop Emery and did not stop the fight when Holtby fell to the ice. Emery was assessed penalties for leaving the crease (2 minutes), instigating (2 minutes), fighting (5 minutes), a ten-minute misconduct, and a game misconduct for his actions. Through the week after the fight, the opinions about St-Laurent's actions were varied from different members of the media. Yahoo's Greg Wyshynski called St-Laurent a \\"joke\\" on the Monday afterwards, saying that he was \\"controlling the game\\". Calmer opinions came from Elliotte Friedman (then of CBC), who said that St-Laurent \\"tried to stop\\" the two combatants, yet \\"backed out\\" when the fight happened; and Darren Dreger of TSN, who said that he \\"couldn't rely on the linesmen\\" because of the multiple fights. Lightning/Canadiens, 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs On 22 April 2014, St-Laurent worked Game Four of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series between the Montreal Canadiens and the Tampa Bay Lightning. During the second intermission, CBC's Ron MacLean spoke up about St-Laurent's participation in the game, saying that he \\"would not have been a popular choice for the Tampa Bay Lightning\\". MacLean's comment stemmed from an incident in Game Three, where a goal for Tampa Bay was waved off by another French-Canadian referee. He had also said that due to Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper's comments about the call, St-Laurent was thrown into Game Four \\"to send a message\\", when he had been assigned to the game before the playoffs began. MacLean apologized for his comments later that night, also saying that he wouldn't have minded if St-Laurent had worked in a later game of the series. Blackhawks/Capitals, 2015 Winter Classic St-Laurent worked the 2015 NHL Winter Classic, a game between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Washington Capitals held at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. It was his first assignment to the Winter Classic. Late in the third period, he called a hooking penalty on Chicago's Jonathan Toews. Toews didn't appreciate the call, saying \\"that's the worst [expletive] call I've ever seen\\". Washington's Troy Brouwer would score on the power play, giving the Capitals the win. Epix's mini-series Road to the NHL Winter Classic showed the penalty call to Toews, with St-Laurent giving an explanation to the Blackhawks captain as to what he saw. Jets/Lightning, 15-16 season Late in the second period of a game between the Winnipeg Jets and Tampa Bay Lightning, played on 18 February 2016, Anton Stralman delivered a questionable hit to Bryan Little. St-Laurent and partner Dan O'Rourke did not issue penalties on the hit. (Blake Wheeler and Stralman would get penalties for roughing, while Stralman would not be suspended. Little ended up missing the rest of the regular season because of a T6 vertebrae fracture.) Upon hearing that there would be no further penalties towards Stralman, Jets coach Paul Maurice took exception to what he had heard from the referees. Based on his comments, the Jets would receive a bench minor. Upon coming back to the bench for the start of the third period, Maurice would be sent back to the locker room, as he was ejected by St- Laurent. TSN, the network covering the game for the Jets, showed St-Laurent looking at the bench. Another shot showed what appeared to be him laughing about something; this gave the commentators the impression that the laughter stemmed from him ejecting Maurice. Said Maurice after the game: \\"I would say that would then have been consistent with their overall demeanor regarding the incident.\\" Aftermath A few days after the incident, Maurice was fined $5,000 for what he said about the referees. In September 2016, St-Laurent revealed that his laughter was unrelated to Maurice; Winnipeg's Dustin Byfuglien cracked a joke shortly after the ejection. Blues/Blackhawks, 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs During the 19 April 2016 playoff game between the St. Louis Blues and Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago's Andrew Shaw received an interference penalty late in the third period. Prior to the next faceoff, as Shaw was in the penalty box, he directed a homophobic slur towards the on-ice officials. Shaw was suspended one game, was fined $5,000, and underwent sensitivity training. While talking to the media after the game, Shaw said that he could not remember what he had said; it was after he watched the incident afterwards that he apologized for his actions. He said that he was \\"sincerely sorry for the insensitive remarks that [he] made\\". Oilers/Jets, 2016 Heritage Classic On 23 October 2016, St-Laurent was announced as one of the referees who would be working the 2016 Heritage Classic, a game between the Edmonton Oilers and Winnipeg Jets, held at Investors Group Field in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Coyotes/Golden Knights, 17-18 season During the 2017-18 NHL season, St-Laurent was scheduled to work the game between the Arizona Coyotes and Vegas Golden Knights on 10 October 2017, played at T-Mobile Arena. The game was the first home game in the history of the Golden Knights; the pregame recognized the first responders and paid tribute to the victims of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. Avalanche/Predators, 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs St-Laurent had been assigned to work a first round game between the Colorado Avalanche and Nashville Predators, played on 20 April 2018. After the first period, he left the game due to an unknown injury. As he was being assessed for the injury, standby referee Eric Furlatt was called to replace St-Laurent for the duration of the game. St-Laurent returned for his next assignment, three days later. Lightning/Bruins, 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs Early in the third period of a second round game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Boston Bruins, held on 4 May 2018, St-Laurent fell down on his own as the Bruins were entering the offensive zone. He hit the boards on his left side, but continued to work the period. During the intermission between the third period and overtime, it was revealed that he would not be able to work in the extra period due to an injury. Brad Watson, who was the standby official assigned by the league for the game, took St-Laurent's place for overtime. On the evening of 5 May, it was announced that St-Laurent suffered a broken collarbone in the fall. Oilers/Devils, 2018 NHL Global Series As part of the 2018-19 NHL season, the league announced that the New Jersey Devils and Edmonton Oilers would play exhibition games between SC Bern and K√∂lner Haie respectively. On 3 October 2018, St-Laurent worked the game between the Oilers and K√∂lner Haie at Lanxess Arena in Cologne, Germany. For the game, he was joined by NHL linesman Jonny Murray and two officials from the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (referee Marian Rohatsch and linesman Kilian Hinterdobler). On 6 October 2018, St-Laurent worked the game between the Devils and Oilers in Gothenburg, Sweden. Sabres/Kings, 18-19 season During the second period of a game between the Buffalo Sabres and Los Angeles Kings, played on 20 October 2018, a stick was knocked out of the hands of a Sabres player (Vladimir Sobotka) in their offensive zone and was sent flying towards the Kings bench. As he was the official in the neutral zone at the time, St-Laurent proceeded to skate backwards to position himself so he could catch the stick without it dropping to the ice (and potentially injuring someone, in case the play was to go the other way). He caught the stick of the player as the play had started to move in the direction of the Sabres goaltender. St-Laurent handed the stick back to its owner when there was a quiet moment in play, where there was no chance for a mistake during the transition. Wild/Rangers, 18-19 season St-Laurent was assigned to work a game between the Minnesota Wild and New York Rangers on 21 February 2019. After two periods, it was announced that he would not be returning to the game due to a lower body injury. Play was not stopped due to the injury, and it was unclear how he had gotten injured. International tournaments During the 2002-2003 ice hockey season, St-Laurent was assigned to work the 2003 IIHF World Championship Division 1A tournament, held in Budapest, Hungary. He worked each day of the tournament, with five games in the five days of play. Television appearances Before the 2005-06 NHL season, TVA's LCN en Bref interviewed St-Laurent. During the interview, he said that he was on a five- year contract, as he gained experience between the American Hockey League and the National Hockey League. In a 2010 episode of HBO's 24/7 series involving the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals, St-Laurent was seen talking to Bruce Boudreau about penalties that were issued early in the first period of a preview of the teams' Winter Classic. The next year, during the 24/7 series involving the New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers, a quick camera shot showed him giving Ryan Callahan a cross-checking penalty. A segment during an October 2015 episode of NESN's Behind the B followed St-Laurent through the course of the Boston Bruins' home opener against the Winnipeg Jets. Off-ice contributions In the winter of 2007, St-Laurent took part in the first \\"Zebras Care\\" program that the National Hockey League Officials Association put together. As part of the 40th anniversary of the Officials Association, a logo was created by St-Laurent to help commemorate the milestone. Between 2013 and 2015, St-Laurent ran a summer development camp for referees. Camps were held in Saint-Constant, Quebec in 2014 and Brossard, Quebec in both 2013 and 2015. In the 2015 camp, the participants worked games in L‚ÄôExp√©rience HockeySupr√©matie.com, a tournament with proceeds going towards various charities. During the summer of 2014, he was a speaker in Hockey Quebec's Provincial Elite Officials Program. For the 2019-20 hockey season, St-Laurent (along with the other French-Canadian officials in the NHL) was featured in a video produced by Hockey Quebec, under a theme of \\"no ref, no match\\". Personal life St-Laurent was a goaltender growing up, while spending the late stages of his playing career on the bench as the backup.

A remake of Joy Mathew's successful Malayalam film Shutter (2012), the film stars Sathyaraj in the lead role. The film is presented by A. L. Vijay and produced by A. L. Azhagappan and Sam Paul. The film opened to rave reviews on its release. Plot Shekar (Sathyaraj) is an NRI working in Singapore. He comes to his hometown Chennai after completing his contract. He sees his daughter riding a bike with a male classmate. Fearing that she would stray, he arranges for her to get married as soon as possible and ends her college education. Shekar has invested in a commercial property next to his house which he has let out to store owners, except for one garage. Since he is home, he meets his friends here and they bond every night over a few peg of drinks. One of them is Suri (Varun), a young autorickshaw driver. Around the same time, Sethu (Yugi Sethu), a struggling former film director has written a script that is finally accepted by a producer. However, he leaves his bag by accident in Suri's rickshaw. One day, Suri arranges for Shekar to rendezvous with a call girl in the unoccupied garage near his house to cheer him up after he has an argument with his family over his daughter's marriage and education. While getting some food, Suri bumps into Sethu who demands for his bag back. While traveling to get the bag, Suri is arrested by the police for driving under influence and is held at the local station for the whole night. Shekar and the call girl are left locked up in the garage for two nights in a row. During this time, Shekar convinces the call girl to remain quiet until Suri comes to get them since it would be embarrassing if anyone knows about why they are locked up there. Shekar learns that the call girl was forced to stop college after getting married, but had to become a prostitute to feed her daughter after her husband left them. She only has one friend who she can call during emergencies, but she cannot call him now since he does not know she is a call girl. Shekar also explains that his house is nearby, which is why they cannot simply leave in broad daylight. The call girl also sees the bag with the script which Suri had left in the rickshaw. She reads the script and decides to take it with her. Meanwhile, they overhear Shekar's friends talking outside the garage and learn that one of them has ill intentions towards him. When the coast is finally clear and Suri is released from the station, he comes to get Shekar out. However, Suri is shocked to see that the call girl had left, thinking that he had come to take her. Before leaving, she had told Shekar to call her Thangam. Suri takes the bag back to Sethu, who is shocked to see that his script is gone. Meanwhile, Shekar goes home and is welcomed by his family. It turns out that his daughter had arranged for her friend to unlock the garage. She had also realized the truth but lied to her family about her father leaving town for a few days to calm himself down. Following Thangam's advice, he calls off the engagement and allows his daughter to continue her education. Meanwhile, Thangam goes to meet her only friend, who turns out to be Sethu. She gives him the script that she had taken, not realizing that it was originally his. Inspired by the sudden turn of events, Sethu decides to rewrite the script before directing his film.

In 2014, Kara/Noveren inaugurated a new, energy-efficient waste-to-energy plant in Roskilde, Energit√•rnet (\\"The Energy Tower\\"), designed by Erick Van Egeraat. History The company was established as Kara/Noveren in 2007 through the merger of Kara and Noveren. In 2017, it was renamed Argo. The new name is short for \\"affald ‚Äì ressourcer ‚Äì genbrug - overskud\\". Company Argo is owned by Greve, Holb√¶k, Kalundborg, K√∏ge, Lejre, Odsherred, Roskilde, Solr√∏d, and Stevns municipalities. The company has some 400,000 private and 22,500 commercial customers. The Energy Tower The Energy Tower waste-to-energy plant was inaugurated on 2 September 2014. The cost of its construction was DKK 1.3 billion. The facility produces electricity for approximately 65,000 households and district heating for 40,000 households, utilizing close to 100% of the energy in the waste as opposed to only 7+ % in the old oven line. The electricity is sold to SEAS-NVE while the heat is sold to Roskilde Forsyning. The building is the result of an architectural competition won by Erick Van Egeraat in 2010.

History The first concession for what is now XECO began as XEMX, awarded on September 30, 1934 to Alonso Traslosheros √Åvalos. Originally the station was located on 1280 kHz and had a power of 120 watts.XEMX original concession In 1941 it was sold to Guillermo Robles, who sold it in turn to Publicidad Comercial de M√©xico, S.A., in 1946. By 1954, the station had moved up the dial to 1380 kHz, and in the 1960s the station was owned by N√∫cleo Radio Mil and broadcast a format targeted at women as \\"Radio Femenina\\". Sometime in the late 1960s or 1970s, the station was overhauled as XECO-AM, becoming \\"Radio Eco 13-80\\" and ditching its format for a contemporary music format. In the 1980s this transformed into an oldies format as \\"Dimensi√≥n 13-80\\". In 1994, Radiorama bought XECO and XEUR-AM 1530 from what was now known as NRM Comunicaciones, gaining entry into the Mexico City media market.\\"Concesiones al mejor postor\\", Etc√©tera 1 August 2005 and in 1998, the format was changed to romantic music as \\"Rom√°ntica 13-80\\". The first incarnation of this format competed with similar stations up and down the dial; the format was innovative and depended largely on its hosts and DJs. On May 17, 2005, at 1:35pm, the format was abruptly dropped to become \\"Ke Buena\\" and an AM simulcast of XEQ-FM 92.9; even the station's personalities were taken by surprise at the format change. During this one-year period, Televisa Radio programmed almost all of the station's broadcast day except for some religious programs on AM only that were programmed by Radiorama. Rom√°ntica returned in mid-2006, this time without the personalities that had characterized it in its first run on air.

The Narrow Trail is a 1917 American silent western film directed by Lambert Hillyer and William S. Hart and written by William S. Hart and Harvey F. Thew. The film stars William S. Hart, Sylvia Breamer, Milton Ross, and Bob Kortman. The film was released on December 30, 1917, by Paramount Pictures. Plot As described in a film magazine, Ice Harding (Hart), leader of a gang of outlaws, captures an attractive wild pony he names King and the two become fast friends. Single handed he holds up a stage coach and robs its occupants. Among the passengers is Bates (Ross), a notorious San Francisco dive keeper, and his niece Betty (Breamer), a pretty girl, who is used to lure men to the resort. The gang, fearing capture because of the distinctive pinto horse King that Ice rides, divides up their stake and quits. Ice Harding again meets Betty in Saddle City and they become acquainted, she believing him to be a wealthy rancher. Her uncle plans to fleece Ice, and on the day she leaves to return to the city, she gives Ice a paper with a false address. Ice follows her to San Francisco and, unable to find her, he feels dejected and lonely and wanders into a Barbary Coast waterfront saloon. There he discovers Betty, who is horrified that he found her, and Ice denounces her. Ice gets into a fight with two toughs who are in the business of shanghaiing sailors, and then returns to the mountains. Betty, to get away from the dive, leaves and goes to Saddle City. Here she meets Ice, who was intending to rob a bank. They resolve to change their ways, and Ice enters his horse in a free- for-all race. His pinto horse wins, and Ice collects the $1000 prize. About to leave with Betty, Ice is confronted by the sheriff who notes the distinctive horse. Ice knocks him down, grabs up Betty, and the two ride away, outdistancing a posse that follows.

The station airs Christian programming under the name \\"Ondas de Paz\\". History XELZ-AM received its first concession on December 1, 1942, to Mar√≠a Cardona de Zetina. For most of its history under this callsign, it broadcast ranchera music and was known as \\"Radio LZ\\". It was sold to Radio Variedades, S.A. in 1961, and became a part of Grupo Radio Centro. In the late 1970s, the tropical format Radio AI changed from 1320 AM to 1440. By the 1980s, it had adopted the XEEST- AM callsign and was known as \\"Estudiantes AM\\", targeting a youth audience with pop in Spanish. This format evolved into \\"Radio 14-40\\" in the mid-80s with Spanish-language rock joining the musical mix. Yet again, in 1989, the station changed names, this time to \\"Radio Alegr√≠a\\", but kept its format, eventually incorporating the wave of Spanish-language rap. In 1993, the format was changed and the station became \\"Radio √âxitos\\" (a name that had been used on XERC-AM until 1988), with 1960s classic rock in English. In 1996, Grupo Radio Centro ceded the station's operational control to Grupo Radial Siete, after having taken control of XHFO-FM three years earlier. Under Radial Siete, the station changed yet again, to \\"Sonido Crystal\\" with a grupera format; in 1998, it became the news-oriented \\"Radio Noticias 14-40\\". By 2005, it offered ballads and spoken programs as \\"La Reina del Hogar\\"; this changed to the all- spoken \\"Cambio 14-40\\" in 2007. The station took on its current format in 2012; for the first two months as a romantic station, it was known as \\"Radio Amor 14-40\\" but not long after changed to its current name, possibly to avoid confusion with XHSH-FM, known as \\"Amor 95.3\\". On May 15, 2017, Qui√©reme moved from XEEST to the stronger XEINFO-AM 1560. The move took place the same day as a major reshuffle of the AM stations owned by Grupo Radio Centro. XEEST returned to the air on October 2 after having been relocated to a new transmitter site in the Atlazolpa neighborhood of Mexico City, shared with Radio Centro's XEQR-AM 1030 and unrelated station XEITE-AM 830. However, on October 2, 2017, Qui√©reme reverted to XEEST-AM as XEINFO-AM licensee was granted the migration of the station to the FM band as XHINFO-FM 105.3. At 7pm on February 14, 2019, Qui√©reme moved to XEITE-AM 830, and 1440 fell silent again.

It originated when a majority of members resigned from the socialist French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) party to set up the French Section of the Communist International (SFIC). The SFIO had been divided over support for French participation in World War I and over whether to join the Communist International (Comintern). The new SFIC defined itself as revolutionary and democratic centralist. Ludovic-Oscar Frossard was its first secretary-general, and Ho Chi Minh was also among the founders. Frossard himself resigned in 1923, and the 1920s saw a number of splits within the party over relations with other left-wing parties and over adherence to the Communist International's dictates. The party gained representation in the French parliament in successive elections, but also promoted strike action and opposed colonialism. Pierre S√©mard, leader from 1924 to 1928, sought party unity and alliances with other parties; but leaders including Maurice Thorez (party leader from 1930 to 1964) imposed a Stalinist line from the late 1920s, leading to loss of membership through splits and expulsions, and reduced electoral success. With the rise of Fascism this policy shifted after 1934, and the PCF supported the Popular Front, which came to power under L√©on Blum in 1936. The party helped to secure French support for the Spanish Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, and opposed the 1938 Munich agreement with Hitler. During this period the PCF adopted a more patriotic image, and favoured an equal but distinct role for women in the communist movement. The party was banned in 1939 on the outbreak of World War II. Under Comintern direction the PCF opposed the war and may have sabotaged arms production. The leadership, threatened with execution, fled abroad. After the German invasion of 1940 the party failed to persuade the occupiers to legalise its activities, and while denouncing the war as a struggle between imperialists, began to organise opposition to the occupation. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union the next year, the Comintern declared Germany to be an enemy, and the PCF expanded its anti-German activities, forming the National Front movement within the broader Resistance and organising direct action and political assassinations through the armed Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) group. At the same time the PCF began to work with de Gaulle's \\"Free France\\", the London-based government in exile, and later took part in the National Council of the Resistance (CNR). By the time the German occupation ended in 1944, the party had become a powerful force in many parts of France. It was among the leading parties in elections in 1945 and 1946, and entered into the governing Tripartite alliance with the socialist SFIO and the Christian democratic MRP. The Tripartite governments pursued social reforms and statism. However, amid concerns within France and abroad over the extent of communist influence, the PCF was excluded from government in May 1947. Under pressure from Moscow, the PCF thereafter distanced itself from other parties and focussed on agitation within its trade union base. For the rest of the Fourth Republic period the PCF, led by Thorez and Jacques Duclos, remained politically isolated, still taking a Stalinist line, though retaining substantial electoral support. Although the PCF opposed de Gaulle's formation of the Fifth Republic in 1958, the following years saw a rapprochement with other left-wing forces and an increased strength in parliament. With Waldeck Rochet as its new secretary- general, the party supported Fran√ßois Mitterrand's unsuccessful presidential bid in 1965 and started to move apart to a limited extent from the Soviet Union. During the student riots and strikes of May 1968, the party supported the strikes while denouncing the revolutionary student movements. After heavy losses in the ensuing parliamentary elections, the party adopted Georges Marchais as leader and in 1973 entered into a \\"Common Programme\\" alliance with Mitterrand's reconstituted Socialist Party (PS). Under the Common Programme, however, the PCF steadily lost ground to the PS, a process that continued after Mitterrand's victory in 1981. Initially allotted a minor share in Mitterrand's government, the PCF resigned in 1984 as the government turned towards fiscal orthodoxy. Under Marchais the party continued loyal to the Soviet Union up to its fall in 1991, and made little move towards \\"Eurocommunism\\". Extensive reform of the party's structure and policies had to wait until 1994, when Robert Hue became leader. The party's renunciation of much traditional communist dogma after this did little to stem its declining popularity, although it entered government again in 1997 as part of the Plural Left coalition. Elections in 2002 gave worse results than ever for the PCF, now led by Marie-George Buffet. Under Buffet, the PCF turned away from parliamentary strategy and sought broader social alliances. It condemned the Nicolas Sarkozy government's response to riots in 2005 and adopted a more militant stance towards the European Union. Buffet's attempt to stand in the 2007 presidential election as a common candidate of the \\"anti-liberal left\\" had little success. To maintain a presence in parliament after 2007 the party's few remaining deputies had to group together with those from The Greens and others to create the Democratic and Republican Left group (GDR). Subsequently, a broader electoral coalition, the Left Front (FG), was formed including the PCF, Jean-Luc M√©lenchon's Left Party (PG), United Left, and others. The FG has continued up to the present and has brought the French communists somewhat better electoral results, at the price of some tension within the party and with other parties in the FG. With Pierre Laurent as leader since 2010, in a symbolic move the party no longer includes the hammer and sickle logo on its membership cards.  Foundation  The French Communist Party was founded in December 1920 by a split in the socialist French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), led by the majority of party members who supported membership in the Communist International (or \\"Comintern\\") founded in 1919 by Lenin after the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 sparked tensions within the SFIO, when a majority of the SFIO took what left-wing socialists called a \\"social-chauvinist\\" line in support of the French war effort. Gradually, anti-war factions gained in influence in the party and Ludovic-Oscar Frossard was elected general secretary in October 1918. Additionally, the success of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia aroused hope for a similar communist revolution in France among some SFIO members. After the war, the issue of membership in the new Communist International became a major issue for the SFIO. In the spring of 1920, Frossard and Marcel Cachin, director of the party newspaper L'Humanit√©, were commissioned to meet with Bolshevik leaders in Russia. They observed the second congress of the Communist International, during the course of which Vladimir Lenin set out the 21 conditions for membership. When they returned, Frossard and Cachin recommended that the party join the Communist International. At the SFIO's Tours Congress in December 1920, this opinion was supported by the left-wing faction (Boris Souvarine, Fernand Loriot) and the 'centrist' faction (Ludovic-Oscar Frossard, Marcel Cachin), but opposed by the right-wing faction (L√©on Blum). This majority option won three quarters of the votes from party members at the congress. The pro-Comintern majority founded a new party, known as the French Section of the Communist International (Section fran√ßaise de l'Internationale communiste, SFIC), which accepted the strict conditions for membership. A majority of socialist parliamentarians and local officeholders were opposed to membership, particularly because of the Communist International's strict democratic centralism and its denunciation of parliamentarianism. These members went on to form a rump SFIO, which had a much smaller membership than the SFIC but which could count on a strong base of officeholders and parliamentarians. The founders of the SFIC took with them the party paper L'Humanit√©, founded by Jean Jaur√®s in 1904, which remained tied to the party until the 1990s. In the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) trade unions, the Communist minority split away to form the United General Confederation of Labour (CGTU) in 1922. The new communist party defined itself as a revolutionary party, which used legal as well as clandestine or illegal means. The party organization was run under strict democratic centralist precepts, until the 1990s: the minority factions were compelled to follow the majority faction, any organized factions or contrary opinions were forbidden, while membership was tightly controlled and dissidents often purged from the party. Ho Chi Minh, who would create the Viet Minh in 1941 and then declare the independence of Vietnam, was one of its founding members. Marginalization (1922‚Äì1934) 1928 legislative elections In its early years, as the communists fought the SFIO for control of the French left, the new party was weakened and marginalized by a series of splits and expulsions. The \\"bolshevization\\" or stalinization imposed by the Communist International, as well as Zinoviev's power over the Communist International, led to internal crises. \\"Bolshevization\\" implied not only the adoption of the political strategy of the Communist International but a reorganization of party's structure on the model of the Bolsheviks (discipline, local organization under the shape of \\"cells\\", ascent of a young political staff which came from the working-class). The first secretary-general of the PCF, Ludovic-Oscar Frossard, was often reluctant to obey the directives of the Communist International. Indeed, the party leadership was opposed to the strategy of the \\"proletarian unique front\\". Furthermore, one of Frossard's internal opponents, Boris Souvarine, was a member of the secretariat of the Communist International. Frossard resigned and left the PCF in 1923 to found a dissident United Communist Party which later became the Communist Socialist Party (but Frossard himself rejoined the SFIO). The general secretariat of the Party was shared by Louis Sellier (center faction) and Albert Treint (left- wing faction). At the same time, Boris Souvarine was expelled from the Communist International and the PCF due to his sympathy for Leon Trotsky. In the 1924 legislative election, the PCF won 9.8% of the vote and 26 seats, considerably weaker than the SFIO. But under the leadership of the left-wing faction, priority was given to general strikes and revolutionary actions rather than elections. In the French Parliament, the PCF's first elected deputies were opposed to the Cartel des Gauches coalition formed by the SFIO and the Radical Party, which governed between 1924 and 1926. In order to reconcile the various factions of the party, Pierre S√©mard, railroad worker and union activist, was chosen as the new secretary-general. He wanted to put an end to sectarianism, which was criticized by communist officeholders and leaders of the CGTU. Most notably, he proposed alliances with other left-wing parties (including the SFIO) in order to combat fascism. This strategy was criticized by the board of the Communist International as \\"parliamentarist\\". At the same time, the party campaigned against French colonialism in Morocco (the Rif War), leading to the detention of some PCF members, including S√©mard. On his release from prison, he became more and more controversial. Only 11 PCF candidates were elected in the Chamber of Deputies in the 1928 election, although the PCF increased its support to 11%. In 1927, in the Soviet Union, Josef Stalin sidelined his opponents (Zinoviev, Kamenev and Leon Trotsky) and imposed a strict \\"class against class\\" line on the Communist International. In France, a Stalinist committee took control of the PCF . Its most influential figures came from the Communist Youth, notably Henri Barb√© and Pierre C√©lor. They applied the \\"class against class\\" political line of the Communist International, denouncing social democracy and the SFIO as akin to bourgeois parties. Simultaneously, the new leadership purged dissidents, like Louis Sellier, former secretary-general, who created the Worker and Peasant Party, which merged with the Communist Socialist Party to form the Party of Proletarian Unity (PUP). By the end of the 1920s, the party contained fewer than 30,000 members. The collegial leadership of the party was divided between young leaders and more experienced politicians. The secretary for organization, Maurice Thorez, was chosen as the new secretary-general in 1930. In 1931, Barb√© and Celor were accused of responsibility for excesses in the \\"class against class\\" strategy. Nonetheless, the strategy was continued. Indeed, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, which affected France beginning in 1931, caused much anxiety and disturbance, as in other countries. As economic liberalism failed, many were eagerly looking for new solutions. Technocratic ideas were born during this time (Groupe X-Crise), as well as autarky and corporatism in the fascist movement, which advocated union of workers and employers. Some members were attracted to these new ideas, most notably Jacques Doriot. A member of the presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern from 1922 onwards, and from 1923 onwards the secretary of the French Federation of Young Communists, later elected to the French Chamber of Deputies from Saint-Denis, he came to advocate an alliance between the Communists and SFIO. Doriot was then expelled in 1934, and with his followers. Afterwards he moved sharply to the right and formed the French Popular Party, which would be one of the most collaborationist parties during the Vichy regime. The PCF was the main organizer of a counter-exhibition to the 1931 Colonial Exhibition in Paris, called \\"The Truth about the Colonies\\". In the first section, it recalled Albert Londres and Andr√© Gide's critics of forced labour in the colonies and other crimes of the New Imperialism period; in the second section, it contrasted imperialist colonialism to \\"the Soviets' policy on nationalities\\". In 1934 the Tunisian Federation of the PCF became the Tunisian Communist Party.Gilberg, Trond. Coalition Strategies Of Marxist Parties. Durham: Duke University Press, 1989. p. 256 The PCF suffered substantial losses in the 1932 election, winning only 8% of the vote and 10 seats. The 1932 election saw the victory of another Cartel des gauches. This time, although the PCF did not participate in the coalition, it supported the government from the outside (soutien sans participation), similar to how the Socialists, prior to the First World War, had supported republican and Radical governments without participating. The Communist Party attracted various intellectuals and artists in the 1920s, including Andr√© Breton, the leader of the Surrealist movement, Henri Lefebvre (who would be expelled in 1958), Paul √âluard, Louis Aragon, and others. The Popular Front (1934‚Äì1939) This second Cartel coalition fell following the far-right 6 February 1934 riots, which forced Radical Prime Minister √âdouard Daladier to cede power to the conservative Gaston Doumergue. Following this crisis, the PCF, like the whole of the socialist movement, feared that France was on the verge of fascist takeover. Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 and the destruction of the Communist Party of Germany following the 27 February 1933 Reichstag fire led Moscow and Stalin to change course, and adopt the popular front strategy whereby communists were to form anti-fascist coalitions with their erstwhile socialist and bourgeois enemies. Maurice Thorez spearheaded the formation of an alliance with the SFIO, and later the Popular Front in 1936. During the Popular Front era (after 1934) the PCF rapidly grew in size and influence, its growth fueled by the popularity of the Comintern's Popular Front strategy, which allowed an anti-fascist alliance with the SFIO and the Radical Party. The PCF made substantial gains in the 1934 cantonal elections and established themselves as the dominant political force in working-class municipalities surrounding Paris (the Red Belt) in the 1935 municipal elections. The Popular Front won the 1936 elections; the PCF itself made major gains - taking 15.3% and 72 seats. SFIO leader L√©on Blum formed a Socialist-Radical government, supported from the outside by the PCF. However, the Popular Front government soon collapsed under the strains of domestic financial problems (including inflation) and foreign policy issues (the radicals opposed intervention in the Spanish Civil War while the socialists and communists were in favour), and was replaced by a moderate government led by √âdouard Daladier. As the only major communist party in western Europe that was still legal, the PCF played a major role in supporting the Spanish Second Republic during the Spanish Civil War, alongside the Soviet Union. Blum's government officially maintained a neutral policy of non-intervention, but in practice his government ensured the safe passage of aid and Soviet weapons to the besieged Spanish republicans. The PCF often played a major role in such actions, and it sent a number of French volunteers to fight for the republicans in the International Brigades. At the end of the conflict, the PCF organized humanitarian aid for Spanish refugees. The PCF's 72 deputies (along with only three others) opposed the ratification of the Munich Accords, signed by Daladier and Neville Chamberlain. The PCF believed that the accords would allow Hitler to turn his attention eastwards, towards the Soviet Union. On 12 August 1936, a party organization was formed in Madagascar, the Communist Party (French Section of the Communist International) of the Region of Madagascar.Thomas, Martin. The French empire between the wars : imperialism, politics and society. New York: Manchester University Press, 2005. p. 289 New social positions The cross-class coalition of the Popular Front forced the Communists to accept some bourgeois cultural norms they had long ridiculed.Julian Jackson, The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy, 1934-1938 (1988); Daniel Brower, The New Jacobins: The French Communist Party and the Popular Front (1968) These included patriotism, the veterans' sacrifice, the honor of being an army officer, the prestige of the bourgeois, and the leadership of the Socialist Party and the parliamentary Republic. Above all the Communists portrayed themselves as French nationalists. Young Communists dressed in costumes from the revolutionary period and the scholars glorified the Jacobins as heroic predecessors.Jessica Wardhaugh, \\"Fighting for the Unknown Soldier: The Contested Territory of the French Nation in 1934-1938,\\" Modern and Contemporary France (2007) 15#2 pp 185-201. The Communists in the 1920s saw the need to mobilize young women, but saw them as auxiliaries to male organizations. In the 1930s there was a new model, of a separate but equal role for women. The Party set up the Union des Jeunes Filles de France (UJFF) to appeal to young working women through publications and activities geared to their interests. The Party discarded its original notions of Communist femininity and female political activism as a gender-neutral revolutionary. It issued a new model more attuned to the mood of the late 1930s and one more acceptable to the middle class elements of the Popular Front. It now portrayed the ideal Young Communist as a paragon of moral probity with her commitment to marriage and motherhood, and gender-specific public activism.Susan B. Whitney, \\"Embracing the status quo: French communists, young women and the popular front,\\" Journal of Social History (1996) 30#1 pp 29-43, in JSTOR World War II (1939‚Äì1945) Before Operation Barbarossa (1939 ‚Äì June 1941) Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in August 1939, forming neutrality between both ideological rivals. The non-aggression pact between the Nazis and Moscow dismayed many French communists, a number of whom rejected the pact. A fifth of the PCF's caucus left the party, forming a dissident parliamentary group. Shortly after France entered World War II in September 1939, the PCF was declared a proscribed organisation by √âdouard Daladier's government. At first the PCF reaffirmed its commitment to national defense, but after the Comintern addressed French Communists by declaring the war to be 'imperialist', the party changed its stance. PCF parliamentarians signed a letter calling for peace and viewed Hitler's forthcoming peace proposals favourably. The Comintern ordered the PCF leadership to flee to Belgium, while Maurice Thorez, on Georgi Dimitrov's orders, deserted the army and fled to Moscow in order to escape prosecution. The PCF became a clandestine organization, at first rather disorganized. In France, the government dissolved all Communist-led local administrations, cracked down on communist trade unionists and targeted the L'Humanit√© newspaper.Courtois, St√©phane Le PCF dans la guerre, Ramsay, 1980, p.56‚Äì68 The government decreed that any communist propaganda, assimilated to Nazi propaganda, would be punished by the death penalty. Domestically, the PCF led anti-war actions, but although the party published pacifist propaganda for soldiers they stopped short of inciting desertion. The role of the PCF in alleged sabotage operations, against armaments plants, has been a point of debate among historians. In 1951, A. Rossi listed a number of sabotage operations initiated by the PCF against armaments factories throughout France,A. Rossi, Les communistes pendant la dr√¥le de guerre, les Iles d'Or, 1951, r√©√©d √âd. de l'Albatros, 1978 but later historians have downplayed the PCF's role in any such actions, stating that they were isolated cases.Jean-Pierre Az√©ma, De Munich √† la Lib√©ration, 1938‚Äì1944, Points Seuil, 1979, p. 46 After the German invasion of France in 1940 and the ensuing Nazi occupation of France, the relationship between the Communists and the German occupiers fluctuated. The domestic leadership, led by Maurice Tr√©and with the knowledge of Jacques Duclos, petitioned the Germans to allow the republication of L'Humanit√©, which would take a neutral stance on the occupation. But these negotiations were a disaster for the party, as Hitler disavowed Otto Abetz and Vichy was successfully able to oppose the legalization of the PCF. Nevertheless, the PCF limited openly anti-German or anti-occupation actions and instead adopted virulently anti-British, anti-imperialist, anti-socialist and anti- Vichy/P√©tain rhetoric which shied away from directly attacking the Nazi occupiers.Courtois, St√©phane Le PCF dans la guerre, Ramsay, 1980, p. 139-140 In return, Otto Abetz would have allowed for the liberation of over 300 communist prisoners.Peschanski, Denis, Les avatars du communisme fran√ßais de 1939 √† 1941 in La France des ann√©es noires, √©ditions du Seuil, coll. Points, 1993, p. 446 Moscow later denounced the attempts of the PCF to lobby the Germans for the party's legalization. In August 1940, a new policy categorically forbade any expressions of solidarity with the occupiers and limited interactions between the PCF and the occupiers. Simultaneously, however, many communists and PCF cells reorganized clandestinely and began organizing opposition to the Germans and Philippe P√©tain's regime in Vichy. One of the major actions organized by the PCF against the occupation forces was a demonstration of thousands of students and workers, staged in Paris on 11 November 1940. In May 1941, the PCF helped to organize more than 100,000 miners in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais departments in a strike. On 26 April 1941, the PCF called for a National Front for the independence of France with the Gaullists. The Vichy French police, and later the Germans, began to arrest and intern large number of communists. Armed resistance (June 1941 ‚Äì 1945) National Front logo, 1945 When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Stalin ordered all communists to engage in the armed struggle against the new Nazi enemy. The PCF expanded Resistance efforts within France notably advocating the use of direct action and political assassinations which had not been systematically organized up until this point. In August 1941, Pierre Georges (Colonel Fabien) shot and killed a German naval officer in the Paris m√©tro. In October, the Germans stepped up reprisal actions, ordering the execution of 22 interned communists at Ch√¢teaubriant including the 17-year-old Guy M√¥quet, later honoured as a hero of the resistance. By late 1941 and early 1942, the PCF set up the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP), the armed faction of the communist-led National Front. At the same time, with Moscow's blessing, the PCF engaged in talks with Charles de Gaulle, the leader of Free France in London. The communists began cooperating with the Free French, all the while maintaining their distance from other resistance organizations in the north and the south‚Äîremaining independent of the Unified Movements of the Resistance (MUR), the structure organized by Jean Moulin which organized the southern resistance. The National Front, PCF and CGT participated in the creation of the National Council of the Resistance (CNR) in May 1943. During this time period, the PCF was led by Jacques Duclos and Beno√Æt Frachon, operating out of the Hurepoix region in the Essonne department south of Paris. Under their leadership, the PCF maintained strong internal cohesion under centralized authority, which greatly boosted their power and influence within the resistance movement. In the regions, local communists played significant roles in spearheading the resistance. Most famously, the PCF activist Georges Guingouin organized and led the maquis in the Haute-Vienne (Limousin). Immigrant workers linked to the PCF partook in resistance operations through the FTP-MOI (Francs-tireurs et partisans ‚Äì main-d'≈ìuvre immigr√©e). By 1944 the PCF had reached the height of its influence, and was powerful in large areas of the country through the Resistance units under its command. Some in the PCF wanted to launch a revolution as the Germans withdrew from the country, but the leadership, acting on Stalin's instructions, opposed this and adopted a policy of co-operating with the Allied powers and advocating a new Popular Front government. Many well-known figures joined the party during the war, including Pablo Picasso, who joined the PCF in 1944. Share of vote at elections, 1945‚Äì2007 Provisional Government and the Fourth Republic (1945‚Äì1958) The PCF at its peak and the Tripartite governments (1945‚Äì1947) The Communists came out extraordinarily strengthened from the Resistance, in terms of both organisation and prestige. With the liberation of France in 1944, the PCF, along with other resistance groups, entered the government of Charles de Gaulle. As in post-war Italy, the communists were very popular and formed one of the major political forces in the country. The PCF was nicknamed the \\"party of the 75,000 executed people\\" (le parti des 75 000 fusill√©s) because of its important role during the Resistance. By the close of 1945 party membership stood at half a million, an enormous increase from its pre-Popular Front figure of less than thirty thousand. In the first post-war elections for the unicameral interim Constituent National Assembly in October 1945, the PCF became the single largest party in France with 26.2% of the vote and 159 seats. In the June 1946 elections for another constituent assembly, the PCF placed second but remained strong with 26% and 153 seats. In the November 1946 elections, which elected the first legislature of the new French Fourth Republic, the PCF obtained its best result in its history ‚Äì 28.3% and 182 seats. Between 1944 and May 1947, the PCF participated in governing coalitions. Maurice Thorez served in cabinet between November 1945 and May 1947, including a period as vice-president of the council of ministers between January 1946 and May 1947. The PCF was a core component of the Tripartite alliance with the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) and the Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP) throughout this period. The tripartite governments under the provisional government (GPRF) and, after October 1946, the Fourth Republic, introduced a program of social reforms which laid the foundations of the French welfare state. This included the nationalization of strategic economic sectors (electricity (EDF) in 1946, the AGF insurance firm, the Cr√©dit Lyonnais bank in 1945 and the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale bank in 1946, as well as the nationalization of the car maker Renault). Trade union independence was guaranteed by the 1946 Charter of Amiens, a minimum wage established in 1947. This program comprised a substantial part of the so-called acquis sociaux (social rights) established in France during the second half of the twentieth century. Although the PCF were the largest party in most tripartite governments formed between 1945 and 1947, they never obtained the presidency of the council of ministers and only rarely held strategic cabinet portfolios such as finance, defense or the interior. PCF cabinet ministers usually held the public health, armaments, reconstruction, industrial production and labour portfolios. (Ambroise Croizat was minister of labour between 1945 and 1947. The PCF and socialists played a major role in drafting the proposed April 1946 constitution, but it was rejected by voters in a referendum in May 1946, with 53% against. The party's strong electoral showing and surge in membership led some observers, including American under-secretary of state Dean Acheson, to believe that a Communist takeover of France was imminent. A number of factors came to precipitate the expulsion of all PCF ministers from Paul Ramadier's government in May 1947. Abroad, the PCF refused to vote war credits for the First Indochina War and the violent repression of the Madagascar insurrection by the SFIO government created strains with its coalition partners. The United States were worried of communist power in France and Italy, and conditioned Marshall Plan aid to the expulsion of communists from governments in both countries. Domestically, large-scale strikes broke out at Renault factories in April 1947. The PCF was finally expelled from government in May 1947, the same time as the Italian Communist Party (PCI) were expelled from the Italian government. The PCF responded with a series of strikes and sabotages. Political isolation (1947‚Äì1956) The PCF remained isolated thereafter until Fran√ßois Mitterrand's electoral victory in 1981. It thus began to pursue a more militant policy, alienating it SFIO and prompting divisions and tensions on the French left. The PCF fell back on its union activities, at a time when the PCF tightly controlled the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), one of the largest and most militant unions in France. The PCF, no longer restrained by the responsibilities of office, was free after 1947 to channel the widespread discontent among the working class with the poor economic performance of the new Fourth Republic. Furthermore, the PCF was under orders from Moscow to take a more radical course, reminiscent of the Third Period policy once pursued by the Comintern. In September 1947 several European Communist parties met in Szklarska Porƒôba in Poland, where a new international agency, the Cominform, was set up. During this meeting Andrei Zhdanov, standing in for Joseph Stalin, denounced the 'moderation' of the French Communists and their excessive participation in 'bourgeois' parliamentary governments, even though this policy had been previously approved by Moscow. The PCF denounced the administration as the tool of American capitalism. Following the arrest of some steel workers in Marseille in November 1947, the CGT called a strike, as PCF activists attacked the town hall and other 'bourgeois' targets in the city. When the protests spread to Paris, and as many as 3 million workers joined the strike, Ramadier resigned. This development was prevented by the determination of Robert Schuman, the new Prime Minister, and Jules Moch, his Minister of the Interior. It was also prevented by a growing sense of disquiet among sections of the labour movement with PCF tactics, which included the derailment in early December 1947 of the Paris-Tourcoing Express, which left twenty-one people dead. Sensing a change of mood, the CGT leadership backed down and called off the strikes. From this point forward the PCF moved into permanent opposition and political isolation, a large but impotent presence in French politics. The party remained tightly controlled by Thorez, Duclos and Frachon (although the latter focused his activities on the CGT). Thorez remained secretary-general and uncontested leader of the PCF until his death in 1964, but he suffered hemiplegia in 1950 and was often in Moscow for treatment. Duclos, in his absence, became the de facto leader of the PCF. Under Duclos' leadership, potential rivals (Andr√© Marty and Charles Tillon) were sidelined and Auguste Lec≈ìur, a rising star, was purged from the party in 1954. The PCF remained a loyally Stalinist party throughout the period, and the PCF opposed the de-stalinization process begun by Moscow and other communist parties after Stalin's death in 1953. The PCF strongly supported the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. A split occurred as Maoists left during the late 1950s. Some moderate communist intellectuals, such as historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, disillusioned with the policies of the Soviet Union, left the party after the violent suppression of Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The PCF suffered losses in the 1951 election, winning 26.3% of the vote and 103 seats - a loss of 79 seats. The PCF and the Gaullist Rally of the French People (RPF) were sidelined and marginalized by the new governing coalition, the Third Force (a SFIO-Radical-MRP alliance). The Third Force's changes to the electoral law before the 1951 election were designed to weaken the PCF and RPF. Hence, the PCF lost 79 seats and won fewer seats than the SFIO (107) although it had 26.3% of the vote against only 15.4% for the SFIO. The PCF won 25.4% and 150 seats in the 1956 election. The PCF remained in opposition throughout this period, but as a major parliamentary force they contributed to the governmental instability of the Fourth Republic. Jean-Paul Sartre, a \\"comrade\\" of the Communist party, actively supported the National Liberation Front (FLN) (the porteurs de valises networks, in which Henri Curiel took part). Long debates took place on the role of conscription. While this stance by the PCF may have helped it retain widespread popularity in metropolitan France, it lost it credibility on the radical left. Nevertheless, during his scholarship to study radio engineering in Paris (from 1949 to 1953), Pol Pot, like many other colonials educated in France (e.g. Ho Chi Minh in 1920), joined the French Communist Party. In 1959 the PCF federation in R√©union was separated from the party, and became the Reunionese Communist Party.Gilberg, Trond. Coalition Strategies Of Marxist Parties. Durham: Duke University Press, 1989. p. 265 Fifth Republic (1958‚Äìpresent) The Gaullist Fifth Republic (1958‚Äì1972) In 1958, the PCF was the only major party which was homogeneous in its opposition to Charles de Gaulle's return to power and the foundation of the French Fifth Republic. The PCF regarded de Gaulle as a right-wing autocrat with fascist tendencies, and it had been the sworn enemy of Gaullism since 1946. However, given the widespread support for de Gaulle's return to power and the Fifth Republic, the PCF was more marginalized and isolated than ever. The NO vote in the referendum on the new constitution in September 1958 obtained only 20%. In the 1958 legislative election, the first under the new constitution, the PCF won only 18.9% and 10 seats. It was badly penalized by the new two-round system in single-member constituencies, which makes it hard for parties without any electoral alliances or deals with other parties to win many seats. The party faced internal dissent. Maoism became popular with some members of the party, leading to their exclusion from the PCF and the foundation of a small Maoist party in 1963. In the early 1960s, the authority of Maurice Thorez was challenged by some members of the Politburo. Laurent Casanova and Marcel Servin pleaded for a critique of Stalinism in the light of the 1956 secret speech by Khrushchev, and they considered the political positions of the Gaullists to be distinct from the atlantist line of the government of the French Fourth Republic. They were expelled from the Politburo. Little by little, however, the PCF began to escape its political isolation and it was joined in opposition by centre-left and centrist parties. Furthermore, as political debate shifted away from the Algerian War towards socioeconomic issues, the PCF was able to recover lost supporters. In the 1962 legislative elections, the PCF obtained 21.8% of the vote and 41 seats, a substantial recovery aided by mutual withdrawal deals with the SFIO and other left-wing parties in the runoffs (which had not been the case in 1958). In the mid-1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 260,000 (0.9% of the working age population of France).Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H. \\"Communism and Economic Development\\", American Political Science Review, Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar. 1968), pp. 122. Some months before his death, in 1964, Thorez handed over the leadership of the PCF to Waldeck Rochet. The new secretary-general advocated a left-wing coalition against Charles de Gaulle, a reform of the party doctrine (the thesis of the unique party was abandoned). During this time, Georges Marchais gained prominence within the party, after his election to the Politburo in 1961. In the 1965 presidential election, on the belief that a PCF candidate would not be able to do well, the PCF supported the left-wing candidacy of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, a former minister of the French Fourth Republic who was opposed to De Gaulle's regime since 1958. Mitterrand had never been a member of the SFIO (he was the leader of the small Convention of Republican Institutions, CIR) and he enjoyed good relations with all left-wing parties including the PCF and the SFIO. The PCF also signed an electoral agreement with the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left (FGDS) prior to the 1967 legislative election. Mitterrand obtained 44.8% in the runoff. The PCF won 22.5% and 73 seats. In May 1968 widespread student riots and strikes broke out in France. The PCF initially supported the general strike but opposed the revolutionary student movement, which was dominated by Trotskyists, Maoists and anarchists, and the so-called \\"new social movements\\" (including environmentalists, gay movements, prisoners' movement). Georges Marchais, in L'Humanit√© on May 3, virulently denounced the leaders of the movement in an article entitled \\"False revolutionaries who must be exposed\\". He referred to student leader Daniel Cohn-Bendit as the \\"German anarchist\\".Mai 68 et ses suites l√©gislatives imm√©diates : Article de Georges Marchais, L'Humanit√© (3 mai 1968) French National Assembly website, accessed 19 March 2013Buton, Philippe and Laurent Gervereau, Le Couteau entre les dents : 70 ans d'affiches communistes et anticommunistes, √âditions du Ch√™ne, 1989, p. 41 Although the PCF and the CGT were compelled by their base to join the movement as it expanded to take the form of a general strike, the PCF feared that it would be overwhelmed by events - especially as some on the left, led by Mitterrand were attempting to use Charles de Gaulle's initial vacillations to create a political alternative to the Gaullist regime. It welcomed Prime Minister Georges Pompidou's willingness to dialogue and it supported the Grenelle agreements. When de Gaulle regained the initiative over the situation on 30 May, by announcing the dissolution of the National Assembly and snap elections, the PCF quickly embraced the President's decision. However, the PCF‚Äîand the left as a whole‚Äîsuffered very heavy losses in the 1968 legislative elections which saw a Gaullist landslide. The PCF won 20% of the vote and lost over half its seat, holding only 34 in the new legislature. In terms of foreign policy, under Waldeck Rochet's leadership, the PCF slowly and incompletely distanced itself from the Soviet Union. During the Prague Spring, it pleaded for conciliation, then it expressed its surprise and disapproval about the Soviet intervention‚Äîbut it never firmly condemned it. Nevertheless, the PCF publicly criticized a Soviet action for the first time in its history. This event caused frictions in the Politburo: Jeannette Vermersch, Thorez's widow, resigned. Following Charles de Gaulle's resignation after he lost a referendum on constitutional reforms, an early presidential election was held in June 1969. Because of Waldeck Rochet's ill health, senator and party elder Jacques Duclos was the party's candidate. The collapse of the FGDS after 1968 and Mitterrand's temporary fall from grace after his actions in May 1968 broke up the PCF's alliance with the left. Indeed, it was impossible for the PCF to support the SFIO's candidate, Marseille mayor Gaston Defferre, an anti- communist who governed his city in coalition with the centrists. As Defferre's candidacy rapidly foundered, Duclos, buoyed by his amiability and personal popularity, rose in the polls. Duclos won 21.3%, placing third but completely eclipsing Defferre (5%), the PSU's Michel Rocard (3.6%) and Trotskyist leader Alain Krivine (1.1%). Eliminated by the first round, the PCF refused to endorse either Gaullist candidate Georges Pompidou and the centrist caretaker President Alain Poher in the runoff, considering that they were two sides of the same coin (blanc bonnet ou bonnet blanc). Pompidou won easily, with 58.2%, but most PCF voters did not vote: abstention increased from 22.4% in the first round to 31.2% in the second round. In 1970, Roger Garaudy, a member of the Central Committee of the PCF from 1945 on, was expelled from the party for his revisionist tendencies, being criticized for his attempt to reconcile Marxism with Roman Catholicism. From 1982 onwards, Garaudy emerged as a major Holocaust denier and was officially convicted in 1998. The Common Programme, the union of the left and decline (1972‚Äì1981) In 1972 Waldeck Rochet was succeeded as secretary-general by Georges Marchais, who had effectively controlled the party since 1970. Marchais began a moderate liberalization of the party's policies and internal life, although dissident members, particularly intellectuals, continued to be expelled. The PCF formed an alliance with Mitterrand's new Socialist Party (PS). They signed a Common Programme before the 1973 legislative election. The Common Programme marked the PCF's acceptance of democratic principles and civil liberties, and included major institutional, economic and social reforms. The PCF believed, like in 1936, that it would gain the upper hand over the PS and quickly decimate their socialist rivals. On the contrary, however, the PCF was weakened by the alliance with the PS. In the 1973 elections, the PCF increased its support‚Äîwinning 21.4% and 73 seats‚Äîbut the distance separating it from the PS was reduced, with Mitterrand's PS winning 19.2%. Nominally the French communists supported Mitterrand's Common Programme candidacy in 1974 presidential election, but the Soviet ambassador in Paris and the director of L'Humanit√© did not hide their satisfaction with Mitterrand's narrow defeat at the hands of centre-right candidate Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing. According to Jean Lacouture, Raymond Aron and Fran√ßois Mitterrand himself, the Soviet government and the French communist leaders had done everything in order to prevent Mitterrand from being elected: they regarded him as too anti-communist and too skillful in his strategy of re-balancing the Left. As Giscard became increasingly unpopular, the left swept midterm local elections‚Äîthe 1976 cantonal elections and the 1977 municipal elections, which allowed the PCF to strengthen its base in local government. But these elections also confirmed the PCF's slow decline: in the 1976 cantonal elections, the PS (26.6%) obtained more votes than the PCF (22.8%) for the first time since 1936. Internally, the PCF sought to respond to the growing international denunciation of Soviet communism, which followed the Prague uprising (1968) and the publication of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's book The Gulag Archipelago in 1973. In 1976, the PCF dropped references to the dictatorship of the proletariat, affirmed its independence vis-a-vis Moscow and endorsed democratic liberties‚Äîalthough it did not drop revolutionary rhetoric. In L'Humanit√© in January 1976, for example, the party spoke of a \\"democratic and revolutionary way [...] to socialism\\" and \\"taking into account conditions of our time in favour of the forces of progress, liberty and peace\\". The PCF's goal was the \\"transformation of the capitalist society into a socialist society, a fraternal society without exploiters or exploited\\".L'Humanit√©, 20 January 1976 The PCF began to follow a line closer to that of the Italian Communist Party's eurocommunism. However, this was only a relative change of direction, as the PCF remained largely loyal to Moscow, and in 1979, Georges Marchais supported the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Its assessment of the Soviet and Eastern European communist governments was \\"positive overall\\". During Mitterrand's term as PS first secretary, the PS re-emerged as the dominant party of the left. Worried about these trends, Marchais demanded updates to the Common Programme, but the negotiations failed, ending the union of the left. The PS accused Marchais of being responsible for the division of the left and of its defeat at the 1978 legislative election. In the 1978 election, for the first time in a legislative election since 1936, the PCF was surpassed by the PS as the largest party on the left (20.6% for the PCF, 22.6% for the PS). Nonetheless, the PCF won 86 seats. Marchais was the party's candidate in the 1981 presidential election, facing off against, among others, Giscard and Mitterrand. The PCF envisioned the 1981 election as the opportunity for it to regain its leadership of the left, and it was encouraged by Marchais' rising poll numbers (from 15% to 19%). He ran a populist campaign, which attacked the PS‚Äîin particular its alleged shift to the right‚Äîas much as the incumbent right-wing President. Marchais' attacks on Mitterrand were often so harsh that many Socialists felt that Marchais was playing into Giscard's hands by attacking Mitterrand. To counter such accusations, Marchais proclaimed himself as the \\"anti-Giscard candidate\\" and, late into his campaign, attacked the incumbent as the \\"president of injustice\\".Becker, Jean-Jacques, Nouvelle Histoire de la France contemporaine : Crises et alternances (1974‚Äì2000), t. 19, Paris: Seuil, 2002. p. 229 The election was a massive disaster for the PCF. Marchais won only 15.4% in the first round, in fourth place. Reluctantly, Marchais endorsed Mitterrand in the runoff, facilitating Mitterrand's narrow victory with 51.8% on 10 May 1981. Ephemeral governmental experience and decline (1981‚Äì1994) Georges Marchais, leader 1972-1994 The snap legislative election in June 1981 was another major setback for the PCF, which marked the end of the PCF's dreams of regaining leadership of the left. A number of PCF supporters had already defected to the PS and Mitterrand by the first round of the presidential election, and the party was unable to stop the bleeding. In the legislative elections, the PCF won only 16.2% of the vote and 44 seats, a far cry from the PS' 285 seats. After the legislative elections, the PCF obtained cabinet positions in Pierre Mauroy's new government, their first cabinet participation since 1947. The four Communist ministers were Charles Fiterman (transportation), Anicet Le Pors (Public sector), Jack Ralite (health) and Marcel Rigout (professional development). Although some on the right worried about the PCF's participation in government and decried the PS' alliance with the PCF, Mitterrand outmaneuvered the PCF at every turn. As the government's initial leftist Keynesian economic policies proved unsuccessful, with rising unemployment and deindustrialization. Between 1982 and 1983, PS finance minister Jacques Delors changed course in favour of orthodox fiscal and economic policies and austerity measures (rigueur √©conomique). In the 1982 cantonal elections, the PCF won only 15.9% and lost 45 general councillors. It suffered more losses in the 1983 municipal elections. The party suffered another major defeat in the 1984 European elections, in which Georges Marchais' PCF list won only 11.2%, closely followed by the far-right National Front (FN) which broke through to win 11%. In July 1984, with Laurent Fabius replacing Mauroy as Prime Minister, the PCF resigned from the government. The PCF joined the ranks of the opposition, largely abstaining in the National Assembly. The PCF fell under another symbolic threshold in the 1986 legislative election, winning only 9.8% and 35 seats. But Marchais refused to budge, and the PCF remained loyal to Moscow until the end. The PCF leadership imposed Andr√© Lajoinie's candidacy in the 1988 presidential election, despite the opposition of the moderate \\"renewers\\" led by Pierre Juquin who advocated in favour of eurocommunism and eco-socialism. Juquin ran as a dissident against the PCF's official candidate, receiving support from small far-left (Trotskyist), red green/eco socialist and New Left movements. Lajoinie, a poor candidate, obtained only 6.8% while Juquin took 2.1%. The PCF, however, had a brief respite in the subsequent 1988 legislative election, in which it managed 11.3% but lost more seats, winning only 27. Between 1988 and 1993, the PCF did not participate in PS governments, but offered piecemeal case-by-case parliamentary support to the PS. The 1989 European elections marked another low for the PCF, whose list won only 7.7% and elected 7 MEPs. The Communists were unable to benefit from President Mitterrand and the PS' unpopularity after 1991‚Äì1992. In the 1993 legislative elections, marked by a monumental defeat of the PS, the PCF won only 9.3% and 24 seats. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to a crisis in the PCF, but it did not follow the example of some other European communist parties by dissolving itself or changing its name. At the XXVIIIth Congress in 1994, Marchais stepped down as secretary- general in favour of Robert Hue. Renewal, recovery and collapse (1994‚Äì2002) Robert Hue sought to transform and renew the party. In his book Communisme : la mutation, he condemned the Soviet Union, in particular its rejection of individualism, human rights and liberal democracy. Under Hue the party embarked on a process called la mutation. La mutation included the thorough reorganization of party structure and move away from Marxist-Leninist dogma. Democratic centralism was abandoned, the leadership structures revamped and renamed and public criticism of the party line was allowed with the formation of party factions. This move was intended to revitalize the PCF and attract non-affiliated leftists to the party. However, it largely failed to stop the party's decline. In the 1995 presidential election, Hue managed an acceptable 8.6%, a result superior to Lajoinie's 1988 result but inferior to Lajoinie and Juquin's combined support in 1988. Under Hue's leadership, the PCF also renewed its alliance with other left-wing forces, primarily the PS, as part of the Plural Left (Gauche plurielle) coalition. In the 1997 legislative election, the PCF enjoyed a brief recovery, winning 9.9% and 35 seats. Under Lionel Jospin's left-wing government between 1997 and 2002, the PCF returned to government with Jean-Claude Gayssot as Minister of Transportation; Marie-George Buffet as Minister of Youth and Sports; Michelle Demessine (later Jacques Brunhes) as secretary of state for tourism; and, after 2000, Michel Duffour as secretary of state for heritage and cultural decentralization. During a street protest in 2005 in Paris The PCF's brief recovery proved short lived. The party became riddled with internal conflict, as many sectors - notably the \\"orthodox\\" faction - opposed la mutation and the policy of co-governing with the Socialists. In the 1999 European election, the PCF list, despite its attempt to open to social movements and non-communist activists, won only 6.8% and 6 MEPs. 1999 was followed by the 2002 presidential elections, in which Hue won only 3.4% in the first round. For the first time, the PCF candidate obtained fewer votes than the Trotskyist candidates (Arlette Laguiller and Olivier Besancenot), and by virtue of falling under 5% its campaign expenses were not reimbursed by the state. In the 2002 legislative elections, the PCF won only 4.8% of the vote and 21 seats. Hue himself lost his seat in Argenteuil. Hue had already resigned the party's leadership in October 2001 to Marie-George Buffet and was completely sidelined from the party after the 2002 rout. Attempts to stop the decline (2002‚Äì2008) Under Buffet's leadership after 2003, the PCF shifted away from the PS and Hue's mutation. Instead, it attempted to actively reach out to and embrace social movements, trade unions and non-communist activists as a strategy to counter the PCF's decline. The party sought to create a broader alliance including 'anti-liberal' and anti-capitalist actors from civil society or trade unions. One of the shifts in the PCF's strategy after 2003 came in the form of a more militant Euroscepticism (in 2001, the PCF had only abstained rather than voted against the Treaty of Nice while they were in government). As such, in 2005, the PCF played a leading role in the left-wing NO campaign in the referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (TCE). The victory of the NO vote, along with a campaign against the Bolkestein directive, earned the party some positive publicity. In 2005, a labour conflict at the SNCM in Marseille, followed by a 4 October 2005 demonstration against the New Employment Contract (CNE) marked the opposition to Dominique de Villepin's right-wing government; Villepin shared his authority with Nicolas Sarkozy, who, as Minister of the Interior and leader of the right-wing Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) was a favourite for the upcoming presidential election. Marie-George Buffet also criticized the government's response to the fall 2005 riots, speaking of a deliberate \\"strategy of tension\\" employed by Sarkozy, who had called the youth from the housing projects \\"scum\\" (racaille) which needed to be cleaned up with a K√§rcher high pressure hose. While most of the Socialist deputies voted for the declaration of a state of emergency during the riots, which lasted until January 2006, the PCF, along with the Greens, opposed it. In 2006, the PCF and other left-wing groups supported protests against the First Employment Contract, which finally forced president Chirac to scrap plans for the bill, aimed at creating a more flexible labour law. Nevertheless, the PCF's new strategy did not bring about a major electoral recovery. In the 2004 regional elections, the PCF ran some independent lists in the first round - some of them expanded to civil society actors, like Marie-George Buffet's list in √éle- de-France. The results were rather positive for the party, which won nearly 11% in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Picardy, 9% in Auvergne and 7.2% in √éle-de- France. In the 2004 cantonal elections, the PCF won 7.8% nationally and 108 seats; a decent performance, although it was below the party's result in previous cantonal elections in 2001 (9.8%) and 1998 (10%). The PCF did poorly in the 2004 European elections, winning only 5.88% and only 2 out of 78 seats. The new strategy, likewise, also faced internal resistance on two fronts: on the one hand from the party's traditionalist and Marxist-Leninist \\"orthodox\\" faction and from the refondateurs/r√©novateurs (\\"refounders\\" or \\"rebuilders\\") who wanted to create a united front with parties and movements on the left of the PS. Buoyed by the success of the left-wing NO campaign in 2005, the PCF and other left-wing nonistes from 2005 attempted to create \\"anti-liberal collectives\\" which could run a common 'anti-liberal left' candidate in the 2007 presidential election. Buffet, backed by the PCF (except for the r√©fondateurs), proposed her candidacy and emerged as the winner in most preparatory votes organized by these collective structures. However, the entire effort soon fell into disarray before collapsing completely. The far- left - represented by Oliver Besancenot (Revolutionary Communist League) and Arlette Laguiller (Workers' Struggle) was unwilling to participate in the efforts to begin with, preferring their own independent candidacies. Jos√© Bov√©, initially a supporter of the anti-liberal collectives, later withdrew from the process and announced his independent candidacy. The PCF's leadership and members voted in favour of maintaining Buffet's candidacy, despite the failure of the anti-liberal collectives and called on other left-wing forces to support her candidacy. This support was not forthcoming, and after a low- key campaign she won only 1.93%, even lower than Robert Hue's 3.4% in the previous presidential election. Once again, the low result meant that the PCF did not meet the 5% threshold for reimbursement of its campaign expenses. The presidential rout was followed by an equally poor performance in the subsequent legislative elections, in which it won only 4.3% of the vote and 15 seats. Having fallen the 20-seat threshold to form its own group in the National Assembly, the PCF was compelled to ally itself with The Greens and other left-wing MPs to form a parliamentary group, called Democratic and Republican Left group (GDR). The PCF's poor showing in 2007 weighed a lot on its budget.Cash-strapped Communists hawk treasures, The Telegraph, 10 June 2007 French Communist Party in Paris 2012 In the 2008 municipal elections, the PCF fared better than expected but nevertheless had contrasted results overall. It gained Dieppe, Saint Claude, Firminy and Vierzon as well as other smaller towns and kept most of its large towns, such as Arles, Bagneux, Bobigny, Champigny-sur-Marne, Echirolles, Fontenay-sous-Bois, Gardanne, Gennevilliers, Givors, Malakoff, Martigues, Nanterre, Stains and Venissieux. However, the PCF lost some key communes in the second round, such as Montreuil, Aubervilliers and particularly Calais, where an UMP candidate ousted the PCF after 37 years. In the cantonal elections on the same day, the PCF won 8.8% and 117 seats, a small increase on the 2004 results. Left Front (2009‚Äìpresent) Marie-George Buffet at the launch of the FG, 2009 The PCF, to counter its slow decline, sought to build a broader electoral coalition with other (smaller) left-wing or far-left parties. In October 2008, and again at the PCF's XXXIV Congress in December 2008, the PCF issued a call for the creation of a \\"civic and progressive front\\".R√©solution du Conseil national pour les √©lections europ√©ennes on the PCF websiteCommunisteS #332 on the PCF website The Left Party (PG), led by PS dissident Jean-Luc M√©lenchon, and other small parties including the United Left responded positively to the call, forming the Left Front (Front de gauche, FG), at first for the 2009 European Parliament election. The FG has since turned into a permanent electoral coalition, extended for the 2010 regional elections, 2011 cantonal elections, 2012 presidential election and the 2012 legislative election. The FG allowed the PCF to halt its decline, but perhaps with a price. The FG won 6.5% in the 2009 European elections, 5.8% in the 2010 regional elections and 8.9% in the 2011 cantonal elections. However, paying the price of its greater electoral and political independence vis-a-vis the PS, it fell from 185 to 95 regional councillors after the 2010 elections. Nevertheless, the FG strategy caused further tension and even dissent within PCF ranks. Up to the higher echelons of the PCF leadership, some were uneasy with M√©lenchon's potential candidacy in the 2012 presidential election and the PCF disagreed with M√©lenchon's PG on issues such as participation in PS-led regional executives.R√©gionales : les √©lus PG ne participeront pas aux ex√©cutifs r√©gionaux, Le Parisien, 26 March 2010 In 2010, a number of leading r√©fondateurs within the PCF (Patrick Braouezec, Jacqueline Fraysse, Fran√ßois Asensi, Roger Martelli...) left the party to join the small Federation for a Social and Ecological Alternative (FASE). Pierre Laurent, current party leader At the PCF's XXXV Congress in 2010, Buffet stepped down in favour of Pierre Laurent, a former journalist. In 2010, the PCF played a leading role in the protests against √âric Woerth's pension reform, which raised the retirement age by two years. On 5 June 2011, the PCF's national delegates approved, with 63.6% against, a resolution which included an endorsement of M√©lenchon's candidacy as the FG's candidate in the 2012 presidential election. A few days later, on 16‚Äì18 June, an internal primary open to all PCF members was held, ratifying M√©lenchon's candidacy. M√©lenchon's candidacy for the FG, the position endorsed by the PCF leadership, won 59%. PCF deputy Andr√© Chassaigne took 36.8% and Emmanuel Dang Tran, an \\"orthodox\\" Communist, won only 4.1%.R√©sultats du vote des 16, 17 et 18 Juin 2011 Official results on the PCF websiteM√©lenchon, √©lu par les militants PCF, peut partir en campagne pour 2012, Le Parisien, 18 June 2011 M√©lenchon won 11.1% in the first round of the presidential election on 22 April 2012. The 2012 legislative election in June saw the FG win 6.9%, a result below M√©lenchon's first round result but significantly higher than the PCF's result in 2007. Nevertheless, the PCF - which made up the bulk of FG incumbents and candidates - faced a strong challenge from the PS in its strongholds in the first round, and, unexpectedly, found a number of its incumbents place behind the PS candidate in the first round. Applying the traditional rule of \\"mutual withdrawal\\", FG/PCF candidates who won fewer votes than another left-wing candidates withdrew from the runoff. As a result, the FG was left with only 10 seats - 7 of those for the PCF. It was the PCF's worst seat count in its entire history. Despite this defeat, the PCF leadership remains supportive of the FG strategy.

A sick man is held over a cow's hindquarters, so that the cow's urine streams onto his face. Cow urine is a liquid by-product of metabolism in cows. Cow urine is also used in medicine in India, Myanmar, Nepal and Nigeria. While cow urine and cow dung has benefits as fertilizers, the proponents' claims about curing diseases and cancer have no scientific backing.  Claimed benefits and usage  In religious rituals Some Hindus claim that cow urine has a special significance as a medicinal drink. The sprinkling of cow urine is said to have a spiritual cleansing effect as well. Cattle were a basic economic unit in ancient India, and cows are holy for many Hindus and their slaughter is considered to be sinful. Folk medicine Cow urine Cow urine is used for attempted therapeutic purposes in ancient Ayurvedic medicine. Urine of a pregnant cow is considered special; it is claimed to contain special hormones and minerals. According to Ayurveda, Gomutra (cow urine) can cure leprosy, fever, peptic ulcer, liver ailments, kidney disorders, Asthma , certain allergies, skin problems like Psoriasis , anaemia and even cancer. One of India's largest Ayurvedic companies, Patanjali Ayurved, sells urine-based products. Cow urine is also used in Myanmar and Nigeria as a folk medicine. In Nigeria, a concoction of leaves of tobacco, garlic and lemon basil juice, rock salt and cow urine is used in an attempt to treat convulsions in children. This has resulted in the death of several children from respiratory depression. As a floor cleaner A floor-cleaning fluid called Gaunyle is marketed by an organisation called Holy Cow Foundation. Maneka Gandhi, Women and Child Development Minister, has proposed that Gaunyle be used instead of Phenyl in government offices.

Based out of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics and the Research Institute of Economics and Management, the center‚Äôs main objective is implement the nationally representative China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). Two rounds of the survey have been successfully completed to date, and the next round is scheduled for summer 2015. CHFS is a groundbreaking project that collects micro-level financial information about Chinese households all over the country. This includes information about housing and financial assets; liabilities and credit restraints; income and expenditures; social security and insurance; intergenerational transfer payments; demographic characteristics; employment status and payment habits; and many others. The resulting data provides domestic and foreign researchers with a valuable information resource. By collecting and analyzing this information, China is better able to understand itself and the world is better able to understand China.  Sample design and survey implementation   First Round: 2011 Survey  The primary sampling units were taken from 2,585 counties (including counties, districts and county-level cities) all over the country with the exceptions of Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The project employed a stratified three-stage probability proportion to size (PPS) random sample design. The first stage of sampling uses counties; the second stage of sampling uses residential communities from the counties; the final stage of sampling uses extracted households from the neighborhoods and village committees. Each stage of sampling was implemented using the PPS sampling method, weighted by its population size. Interviews were carried out by highly trained students from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE). Each student was required to complete 56 hours of training and pass an exam before being allowed to participate. Households drawn in the sample had to refuse to be interviewed three times or be unavailable six times before being excluded from the survey. Local community representatives were extremely supportive of the project. The first round of the China Household Finance Survey was completed in August 2011 in 25 provinces, 80 counties, and 320 communities throughout the country. The total sample size was 8,438 households and 29,450 individuals.  Second Round: 2013 Survey  In 2013, the survey experienced a large expansion. The primary sampling unit (PSU) covered cities and counties all over the country except for Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The sampling design allowed the data to be not only nationally representative, but also provincially representative. The second round of CHFS was completed in August 2013 in 262 counties (areas and cities at the county level), and 1,048 village communities, with a sample scope of more than 28,000 households.  Third Round: 2015 Survey  The third round of the China Household Finance Survey will be conducted in summer 2015 and expanded to approximately 35,000 households.  Quarterly Telephone Survey  CHFS accessed households' phone numbers in order to conduct quarterly follow-up interviews. These follow-up interviews are conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) (see 3.2). The CATI questionnaire includes: expectations about housing and stock prices; employment status; financial market participation and earning status; and income and expenditures.  Data processing   CAPI and CATI  CHFS developed a proprietary interview system and management platform for both face-to-face interviews and for telephone interviews. This integrated system provides a full package for each computer-based household interview. The Computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) system effectively decreases potential man-made non-sampling errors by presetting the range of possible answers, catching typing errors, and avoiding general human errors (such as skipping questions). The system ensures the confidentiality of the data and ensures real-time accessibility, significantly improving data quality. Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) is an interactive front-end computer system that allows interviewers to ask questions via computer rather than over the telephone. This system saves time, decreases costs, and helps guarantees high quality data.  Quality Control  In addition to using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), the project also designed a more comprehensive quality assurance system in order to reduce problems caused by human error. First, interviews must be refused three times or unanswered six times before the interviewer can go about overseeing a replacement sample. Doing this ensures maximum representativeness and randomness by minimizing the interviewers' opportunities to disregard samples that are difficult to interview by replacing samples that are easier to work with. Second, having the data returned in a timely manner is also necessary to satisfy supporting staff's access to continued real-time analysis and verify the quality requirements. All data is required to be transmitted back to the home office on the same day.  Refusal Rate  When compared to similar domestic and international surveys, CHFS has an impressively low refusal rate of 11.6% in 2011. The urban samples' refusal rate was 16.5% and the rural samples' was 3.2%. In 2013, the overall refusal rate went further down to 10.9%, with urban and rural refusal rate being 15.4% and 0.9%, respectively.  Main findings   Gini Coefficient  According to the CHFS data, in 2010 the household income Gini coefficient was 0.61. Urban China had a 0.58 Gini coefficient while rural China had a Gini coefficient of 0.61. In 2012, the household income Gini coefficient remained at 0.61, as the urban and rural areas had Gini coefficients of 0.59 and 0.58 in 2012, respectively.  Household Assets  The distribution of household assets in China is extremely uneven. In 2013,the median of Chinese household assets was 256,000 RMB. From a national perspective, 10% of householdshad less than 20,000 RMB in assets and 10% of household had more than 1.57 million RMB in assets. In urban areas, 10% of household assets had less than 30,000 RMB in assets and 10% of household assets had more than 2.27 million in assets; there was a median of 441,000 RMB. In rural areas 10% of household had less than 15,000RMB in assets, 10% of households had more than the 621,000 RMB in assets, and there was a median of 131,000 RMB.  Vacancy Rate  According to CHFS data, in 2011 the overall vacancy rate in urban areas was 20.6%. In 2013 this figure rose to 22.4%. According to estimates, in 2013 there were approximately 50 million vacant housing units in urban areas all over the nation.  Credit Access Rate  On average, 18.4% of households had a formal credit demand. Of this, 40.5% of them are met, i.e., the credit access rate for Chinese households is 40.5%. In rural China, 19.6% of households had a formal credit demand while only 27.6% were satisfied. Small and micro-enterprises and individual business with formal credit demands had a credit access rate is 46.2%.  Impact on society and policy  The center wrote a series of reports based on CHFS data that explored the condition of Chinese assets, including income distribution; analysis of the supply and demand of real estate; urbanization; small and micro businesses; and other aspects of Chinese household finance and active suggestions for the related parties. CHFS also wrote and released Data You Need to Know about China: Research Report on the China Household Finance Survey in addition to other writings, arousing widespread interest in academia, government, and industry. On May 31, 2014, Science magazine in the U.S. published the data in issue 304 and its research team conducted a lengthy report (‚ÄúThe Numbers Game,‚Äù Science; volume 340, pp. 1037‚Äì1039). Based on preliminary analysis of the data‚Äôs conclusions, the center continued releasing five rounds of data from May ‚Äì December 2012 and in April and June 2014. It had a greater impact on society than expected. The publications and data have been covered by numerous media sources, both domestic and international, including the Wall Street Journal, The Economist, CNN, and many more.  Plans  The third round of the survey is scheduled for implementation in summer 2015. The size and scope of the sample will be expanded considerably. Meanwhile, surveys on small and medium-sized enterprises and the finances of China‚Äôsgrass-roots organizations will be conducted at the same time. The center plans to conduct monthly telephone interviews beginning in 2015.

Early years He was born in Fatih, Istanbul on July 24, 1940. His father was a director at the mint. He was inspired by a magic show he had attended at primary school. Since he quickly uncovered the magic trick he observed, he tried to copy it by himself. Skilled in handicraft, he constructed a cardboard box, in which he put torn newspaper and took out pieces of colored paper as a trick. Thus, he could amaze his classmates and his teacher. After a hard search, he found a book titled Fenni Eƒülenceler (\\"Scientific Entertainments\\"), from which he learned the finenesses and the secrets of the stage magic art. He began his career in tents set up at special locations during bayrams, the national or religious celebrations in Turkey. At the age of ten, he was invited to perform a magic show during a circumcision feast, for which he received a fee. In the beginning, his parents were against a career in stage magic, because they wanted him to receive a higher education like his older brother, who became an engineer. However, as he proved that he could earn money in his job, they agreed. After secondary school, he dropped out and devoted himself to stage magic. As he was gaining wider interest, he asked his older sister, who was a tailor, to make a tailcoat in black for him, inspired by a photo of the renowned Turkish stage magician Zati Sungur. Stage career In 1952, when he was only twelve, Mehmet Ertuƒürul I≈üƒ±nbark signed a five‚Äìyear contract with Fethi Pehlivan, the manager of the renowned singer Zeki M√ºren. From then on, he used to perform 7‚Äì8 shows every night. In 1959, he went on his first tour accompanying the famous singer Safiye Ayla. Later in his career, he went several times around the country visiting many cities, towns and villages. As he turned 20, his manager gave him the stage name \\"Sihirbaz Mandrake\\" (\\"Mandrake the Magician\\") after the famous newspaper comic strip, a nickname, with which he became well known in Turkey. He told once that even his wife and his daughter called him with that name at home. His magic word was \\"Sim Sala Gala\\", different from \\"Abracadabra\\" or \\"Hocus Pocus\\", which other Turkish magicians used. He grew a goatee just like the renowned magician figure of Abracadabra. After he once observed a ventriloquist on the stage, he decided to perform also this type of stagecraft act. He made a puppeteered \\"dummy\\", which he called \\"Cin Ali\\" (\\"Ali the Ghost\\"). Upon his great success in his performance, his manager asked him to continue with ventriloquism only and to quit stage magic. However, he rejected this proposal, retaining magic shows. The number of his performances at different variety show venues increased up to twelve a night. He received more applause than some star singers on the same stage. Mandrake was elected Turkish champion of stage magic during a contest in 1965. He established Turkey's first and the only school of stage magic in 1979, with the aim to share his knowledge and skills, and to contribute to the education of young people in the art of stage magic. Many Turkish stage magicians of today were his students. His main characteristic was to invent new magic tricks. Many of his tricks were taken over into related European catalogues. Family life In 1958, he met his later wife S√ºheyla during a feast fair in Karag√ºmr√ºk, Istanbul. He returned from his first tour in 1959 with some money in his purse, he married her. The next year, he went into military service in Eski≈üehir, his wife followed him there. S√ºheyla became his assistant on the stage. At the age of three and half, their daughter I≈üƒ±n began to join them on the stage as well. After his wife retired, their daughter, a bank employee, and her husband assisted Mandrake at the shows. Mehmet Ertuƒürul I≈üƒ±nbark died of cardiac insufficiency at the age of 73 on May 28, 2014. He was hospitalized from his summer residence at Gelibolu, √áanakkale on May 19. His corpse was transferred to Istanbul on May 29, and he was given a religious ceremony at Fatih Mosque.

Buniapone amblyops, the single described species, is found in Southern and Southeast Asia. Etymology Head view of a Buniapone amblyops worker The genus name is derived from orang bunian, supernatural forest-living beings in Malay folklore, with the suffix -pone from the name of subfamily. Taxonomy The genus was established by Schmidt & Shattuck (2014) to house the single species Ponera amblyops (at the time a junior synonym Pachycondyla amblyops), which was first described by Emery (1887) from worker specimen from the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The type species has a long and complicated taxonomic history, variously belonging to the genera Ponera, Trapeziopelta (now Myopias), Belonopelta, Pachycondyla, Pseudoponera, Euponera and Pachycondyla. One subspecies, B. amblyops oculatior from Indonesia, has been described. Molecular phylogeny by Schmidt (2013) resolved Buniapone as a sister to the strictly African genus Paltothyreus. Distribution The genus is distributed in Southern and Southeast Asia, from China to Indonesia and India. Description Little is known about their biology, but they have a subterranean lifestyle and are thought to be predators, although not strictly carnivorous. Workers are medium in size (5.5‚Äì6.5 mm), orange-colored, and have long and narrow mandibles with seven teeth. Queens are similar to the workers, but larger (9.25 mm). Buniapone is morphologically similar to some Cryptopone and Promyopias species. However, Buniapone is more closely related to other species and the similarities are deemed to have evolved through convergent evolution.

It is among the 32 Upanishads attached to the Krishna Yajurveda, and classified as one of the 19 Sannyasa Upanishads. The text has been one of the important Upanishads dealing with Hindu renunciation traditions. It discusses Atma (soul) and its four avasthas (states of consciousness) and four seats; the seats for the purpose of achieving Dhyana (mediation) of the Nirguna Brahman (the formless Brahman). It is presented as a conversation between Sage Pippalada and Shaunaka Mahashala. The Brahma Upanishad is notable, in its third chapter, for rejecting all forms of rituals and external religious observations, and declaring the highest complete state of man is one that is dedicated entirely to knowledge. In the Telugu anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, the Brahma Upanishad is listed at number 11. The text is also referred to as Brahmopanishad. Chronology and anthology The date or century in which Brahma Upanishad was composed is unknown. Textual references and literary style suggest that this Hindu text is ancient, composed before the Ashrama Upanishad which is dated to the 3rd-century CE. In Colebrooke anthology of 52 Upanishads, popular in North India, the Brahma Upanishad is listed at number 10. In Narayana's anthology of 52 Upanishads, popular in South India, the Upanishad is listed at 10 as well. In later age compilation collection which was brought out in South India, Brahma Upanishad is part of the 108 Upanishads. Structure The Brahma Upanishad manuscripts have survived into the modern era in different versions. The divisions and structure of these manuscripts is different, particularly those referred to as \\"Calcutta and Poona editions\\", though with similar message. The Telugu language versions exist in two very different versions in terms of size, with one recension splitting the text into Parabrahma Upanishad and Brahma Upanishad. The most studied version of the manuscript consists of four parts, but presented in three chapters. The four parts are structured as two prose sections and two metered poem sections. The prose sections are the most ancient layer in this Upanishad given their archaic Sanskrit style, while the poetic parts likely added at some later time. The initial portions of the text contain general speculations not renunciation, which has made scholars such as Narayana question whether it belongs in the text. Starting about mid 2nd chapter and all of the 3rd chapter constitute a treatise on the ancient Hindu tradition of renunciation. Contents The text opens with Shaunaka Mahashala ‚Äì a wealthy householder, meeting Vedic sage Pippalada, calling human body as the \\"divine city of Brahman (the Supreme One)\\", and inquiring about how the human body is constituted, what is the source of power found in human body? Brahman is the Self in human body Brahman, states sage Pippala in the text, indeed is the Prana (breath, life-force) and is the Atma (soul). The self's form is the shining Brahman that resides in one‚Äôs body giving it a glow, and which controls everything. The Brahman is Prana, and the life of the gods that are the vital sensory organs in human body, their beginning and end. The soul weaves a connection to the gods of sensory organs similar to a spider, states the Brahma Upanishad. Prana soars to heights when awake and retires during deep sleep, states the text, just like the falcon soars to the skies and returns to its nest in the night. The Chapter 1 uses many similes using nature to describe how the soul and the human body interact. The Brahman (Atman) leads all these gods within the human body, and they follow him, asserts the text, in a way similar to bees and queen-bee. They do and focus on what the Atman wants. He connects a web with them, and withdraws within itself like a spider. In a similar way, Prana spreads out into arteries in the temple that is human body and also retracts when it wants to. When the human body goes into deep sleep, the Prana retires, just like falcon soars to the skies when he wants to and then goes to his nest to retire. The soul is not affected by rituals and rites, nor by good or evil, states the Upanishad. This soul (Devadatta) is like a child without desires experiencing joy innocently, he loves the highest light, experiences the joy therein. Like a caterpillar, which moves from its first grass or leaf abode to the next leaf, puts its foot forward to get a firm footing there before leaving its original abode; the Atman moves to its new abode yet retains a footing in the sleeping body. The Atman, states the text, is the source of the Vedas and the gods. Both Deussen and Olivelle state that the prose in this chapter and many of the similes are fragments and references to earlier Upanishads, such as Mundaka Upanishad 1.1.7 and 2.2.9, Kaushitaki Upanishad at 4.19, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in section 4.3, and Prashna Upanishad in 2.4. Brahman, as the Atman, expresses itself when the man is awake, he is the bird, the crab, and the lotus. While the bird and lotus analogy for the human soul is commonly found in Vedic literature, this is the first and isolated mention of crab analogy, states Deussen. It may refer to a lost Upanishad, or Schrader suggests that the chaotic movements of a crab that is difficult to follow, might be implied in the crab simile here. The Atman is the higher and lower brahman, the one inspiring the principle of non-harm (Ahimsa), imbuing consciousness into the gods that are sensory organs, he is the swan, he is the self. Four states of consciousness Some South Indian versions of the Brahma Upanishad manuscripts begin here. As Purusha, Brahman has four dwellings or seats which are the navel, the heart, the throat, and the head. From these emanate the four aspects through which Brahman is effulgent. These are the state of wakefulness representing God Brahma; the state of dreaming which denotes God Vishnu; the state of \\"dreamless sleep\\" that is Rudra's form; and the \\"transcendental\\" imperishable state of Turiyam in which Brahman is supreme. The Para Brahman (Supreme Brahman) is, states Brahma Upanishad, same as Aditya, Vishnu, Ishvara, Purusha, Prana (human breath, life force), individual Self (soul), and the \\"god-filled fire inside the Brahman-city of human body\\" where the highest Brahman shines. The shining Brahman state of the Atman has no worlds or non-worlds, no Vedas nor non-Vedas, neither gods nor non-gods, no sacrifices nor non-sacrifices, no mother nor father, no non-mother nor non- father, no relatives no non-relatives, no ascetic nor non-ascetics, neither recluse nor non-recluse, and this one highest Brahman is which shines. This Atman-Brahman lives in the space of one's heart, but a universe is in it, weaving all we experience. The same soul is ever present in all living creatures, and to know this soul through meditation is to become the highest Brahman. This knowledge is liberation, states the Brahma Upanishad. In this spirit, in this heart, in this consciousness it is. Renunciation Put away the sacred thread and shear off the tied tuft of hair on your head, states the text, as it begins its discussion of renunciation. Abandon the external rites and rituals, and rest in peace with your soul and pursuit of its wisdom, the one who does so has understood the Vedas. Everything in this universe is interwoven into the Atman-Brahman, like rows of pearls upon a string. It is this string a yogin, who understands the truth of yoga, should wear. Knowledge is the hair-tuft, knowledge is his sacred thread, knowledge to the renouncer is the highest, states the text. Knowledge is the incomparable means of self purification, the state of purity, the means of purification. The Brahmin, translates Deussen, is engaged in Vedic duties wearing the hair tuft and the external sacred thread then doing the ritual works, but it is the one who wears knowledge as his hair tuft and internal sacred thread is the true state of Brahmin. The Brahma Upanishad then references and includes a fragment from the Shvetashvatara Upanishad chapter 6.11: The sage is within, one's own soul, and those who know this have eternal peace, asserts the text. One should make one's Self as lower churn-stick (fire stick), the Om the upper churn-stick, then rub them through meditation to see the godly latent fire within. Just like there is butter in milk, oil in seeds, water in streams, fire hidden in dormant churn-stick, there is Atman within to be found. Through meditation and with such wisdom, asserts the text, one's soul unites itself with the supreme soul. This journey is twilight worship.

President of the Uzbek SSR, Islam Karimov declared Uzbekistan independent from the USSR on 31 August 1991. That same day, the Supreme Soviet of Uzbekistan adopted a resolution on the declaration of independence of the Republic of Uzbekistan and a law on the state independence of Uzbekistan. Once the laws were signed by Karimov, the Uzbek SSR was renamed to the Republic of Uzbekistan The next day was then declared a national holiday, and a day off from work by the government.

Until 2005 he worked at Orrefors glassworks, and has subsequently been a professor at Konstfack (University College of Arts, Crafts and Design) and an independent artist.Danius, Sara (2006), p. 95http://www.galerienec.com/assets/Uploads/PerBSundbergCV.pdf Sundberg studied at Capellag√•rden and Konstfack. In 2004, he held a solo exhibition at the R√∂hsska Museum in Gothenburg, called ‚ÄúGreatest Hits 1983-2004‚Äù.Nanfeldt, Michael (2004) In 2005 he received the first Form scholarship from the Swedish Visual Arts Fund.Peres, Maria (2011), p. 23 In summer 2011, a solo exhibition was dedicated to his pottery at the Gustavsberg Art Gallery in Stockholm.Peres, Maria (2011) In November 2014, Sundberg was awarded the Swedish Visual Arts Fund Scholarship.http://www.konstnarsnamnden.se/default.aspx?id=17364  Artistic expression  A starting point in much of Sundberg‚Äôs artwork is nature. Animals and plants are present in often unexpected juxtapositions; sometimes humorously created, sometimes more thoughtfully. In his glasswork, Sundberg often uses inset images in the form of decals from the old Gustavsberg porcelain factory and with properties to withstand high temperatures.Danius, Sara (2006), p. 38 The inset images contrast with one another, creating tension in the work. Sundberg also uses decals in his ceramic art, as well as ceramic figurines from flea markets. Unexpected encounters between sculpted nature and combinations of figurines take place. In some works, both in glass and ceramics, Sundberg discusses the concept of function.Danius, Sara (2006), p. 40 Is a special function associated with a particular shape? is one of the questions he investigates. Common to Sundberg‚Äôs oeuvre is the sculptural expression, which from around 2011 has become even more articulated.Peres, Maria (2011), p. 25-88 (images)  Education  Per B. Sundberg grew up in Huddinge, south of Stockholm, where he early showed interest in creative expression, including in textile.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123690376734313981 Sundberg applied and was accepted to the pottery division at Capellag√•rden in Vickleby 1983-85. In the years 1985-1992 he studied glass and ceramics at Konstfack in Stockholm, with a break in 1988 to study at the Pilchuck Glass School in Seattle.Nanfeldt, Michael (2004)  Work  After completing his studies Per B. Sundberg established himself as glass and ceramic artist. He creates mostly unique art objects or public art, since 2005 full-time in his own studio in Gustavsberg.Peres, Maria (2011), p. 17 After training at Konstfack, he and some fellow students established a glass studio on the islets Fj√§derholmarna, at the inlet to Stockholm. Here Sundberg blew glass, inter alia together with his colleagues Gunilla Kihlgren and M√•rten Medbo. During the years 1994-2005, Per B. Sundberg was an employee at Orrefors glassworks. His glass art also attracted international attention and purchases, including by the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. During his time at Orrefors glassworks, Sundberg developed new glass techniques. The Fabula technique is based on Orrefors classic graal technique. Heat-resistant decals are pasted on a cylindrical glass blank.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123690376734313981 The glass blank is heated, overlaid with clear glass and blown to the desired basic shape. Still hot, the object is then formed using metal tools. Artistic themes are flora and fauna, as well as celebrities. The Litograal technique is similar, in which the decals are replaced with black and white copies from comic books, often of a sexual nature. Sometimes Sundberg makes the glass surface opaque and polishes windows into the subject.Orrefors (2000) In connection with the transfer of ownership of the Orrefors Kosta Boda glassworks in 2005, Sundberg left Orrefors and was hired as a professor at the Konstfack Department of Design, Crafts and Arts. In parallel with the work at Konstfack, Sundberg has worked in his own studio at the old premises of the Gustavsberg porcelain factory. When operations ceased at the factory, a number of independent artists moved into the premises, including Sundberg. An important element in Sundberg‚Äôs artistic process is to use materials that others have left: clays, glazes, decals and figurines. These then form the palette of his creativity.Danius, Sara (2006), p. 38-40Peres, Maria (2011) Sundberg is constantly looking for new expressions and to test the limits of materials. In the studio, he has developed new ceramic materials, including clays and glazes from the old factory. Sundberg combines figurines, found at flea markets, with a self-constructed foundation. A number of firings with different glazes follows. Glazes are thus part of the sculpted expression.Peres, Maria (2011), p. 19  Selected exhibitions  (Regarding Exhibitions please see Danius, Sara (2006), p. 95, http://www.galerienec.com/assets/Uploads/PerBSundbergCV.pdf and Peres, Maria (2011), p. 23) * 1988 Gallery De 20, V√§xj√∂ * 1996 Orrefors Museum, Orrefors * 1997 Olle Olsson Hagalund Museum, Solna * 2000 Gallery Kamras, Borgholm * 2000 Stockholm New, New York * 2003 Gallery Orrefors Kosta Boda, Stockholm * 2004 ‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast‚Äù, Craft Council, London * 2004 VIDA art gallery, √ñland * 2004 ‚ÄúGreatest Hits 1983-2004‚Äù, R√∂hsska Museum, Gothenburg * 2005 ‚ÄúConcept Design‚Äù, Nationalmuseum, Stockholm * 2006-2011 Voices, Swedish Institute touring exhibition, Germany, France, Belgium and the US * 2009 Hands on, Dunkers kulturhus, Helsingborg * 2009 State of Things, Kulturhuset, Stockholm * 2011 Per B.

For his contributions to the local music scene, Tang was conferred the Cultural Medallion in 2011. Early life Tang's love for music began at an early age. He started piano lessons at age six, and later played the tuba in his secondary school band. The young Tang did not find the tuba particularly interesting to play as there were not usually many parts in a musical composition that involved the instrument. However, this lack of activity turned out to be a blessing in disguise as it gave him the opportunity to observe what the other musicians in the band were doing and how all the parts fit together in a musical composition. Tang began writing music even as a student. His interest in music grew and he went on to helm a Christian gospel pop group. He also played bass guitar while in Anglo- Chinese Junior College and later on in the army band. Education Tang enrolled at York University in Toronto, Canada with the support of his parents. In 1982, during his first year as an undergraduate at York, Tang met and was greatly influenced by Srul Irving Glick, his first music composition teacher. He was awarded his master's degree in composition by Northwestern University in 1991, and received his PhD in Music at Michigan State University in 1995. Career Tang's compositions have been performed by world-renowned ensembles such as the Russian National Orchestra, the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, Minguett Quartet (Germany) and the Ensemble Contemporain of Montreal. In Singapore, his music is regularly performed by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, the Singapore National Youth Orchestra and T‚Äôang Quartet. In Asia, Tang‚Äôs orchestral works have been performed by the Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra, the Royal Thai Navy Orchestra, Macau Youth Symphony Orchestra and Vietnam National Symphony Orchestra.

During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, he was a commander in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and established the 27th Muhammad Rasool-Allah Division of Tehran. He played a role in the Liberation of Khorramshahr and later, as part of a senior diplomatic group of political and military leaders, went to Syria. On 5 July 1982, when the vehicle carrying the diplomats was passing through a checkpoint post on its way to Beirut, it was intercepted by Phalange Party. The car and four passengers, completely disappeared. Iran has accused Israel of kidnapping and holding them in Israeli jails and covering up their fate. Israel has said it is not aware of the fate of the diplomats. Iran called on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to investigate their whereabouts. Three decades after the incident, the fate of the missing diplomats remains a mystery, and the search for Motevaselian and the other Iranians continues. However, it is assumed that shortly after their abduction, they were executed by the Phalange.  Early life  Ahmad Motevaselian was born in a religious family in 1954 in the south of Tehran. He spent his primary school in Mostafavi school in Tehran. During his education, Motevaselian helped his father in his pastry shop. When he was a teenager, he participated in religious ceremonies and masque and started his political activities against the then ruling regime of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. After finishing his primary education, he went to industrial school and received his diploma in 1973.  Before the Iranian Revolution  After graduation, Motevaselian went to Shiraz for military service and participated in a special tank training course and was then dispatched to Sarpol-e Zahab. During his service, he continued his political activities against the Shah. After military service, he was employed in a private company and after a few months was sent to Khorramabad. In 1976, the SAVAK 'secret police' arrested him for his political activities. He was jailed for five months in solitary confinement in Falak-ol-Aflak Castle in Khorramabad. Motevaselian actively participated in the 1979 Revolution in his neighborhood and also the south of Tehran. After the victory of the Revolution, he established the Committee of the Islamic Republic in the district near his home, and later joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  After the Iranian Revolution  Following the success of the Revolution, Motevaselian engaged in various revolutionary political and military campaigns: * The operations against opposition within Kurdistan Province * Fighting anti- revolutionaries in Bokan, Baneh, and Saghez in 1979 * Liberation of Sanandaj in western Iran from anti-revolutionaries * Liberation of Paveh-Kermanshah road in 1980 * Liberation of Marivan city in May 1980 * Liberation of Dezli heights * Established the 27th Muhammad Rasool-Allah Division * Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas on 30 April 1982  Mission in Lebanon  After the Liberation of Khorramshahr, Motevaselian knew that Israel had invaded Lebanon. In June 1982, he went to the Lebanese-Syrian border as head of a commando unit, but the unit was sent back to Iran by Syrian authorities but Motevaselian stayed for protecting Iran's embassy from Israeli and Phalange Party. On 5 July 1982, when the vehicle carrying the diplomats was passing through a checkpoint post on its way to Beirut, it was intercepted by Phalange Party, and the car and four passengers disappeared, despite diplomatic immunity and that they were using an official state vehicle. For the last time, Iranian diplomats were seen at Barbara checkpoint that controlled by Elie Hobeika. They were then abducted by the Phalange Party. The missing diplomats are Motevaselian, military attach√© and the head of the commandos of the June dispatch; Seyed Mohsen Mousavi, charg√© d'affaires for the Iranian embassy in Beirut; and Taghi Rastegar Moghadam, the embassy technician; plus Kazem Akhavan, a journalist for Islamic Republic Press Agency. Eight years later Geagea said: \\"they had been killed on the orders of the group's intelligence chief, Elie Hobeika.\\" According to an Israeli report, these men were killed by Lebanese forces. Israel claimed in a statement in 2010 that the diplomats had never been surrendered to Israel. Elsewhere in response to a request by the Lebanese Hezbollah, it claimed that the four were dead. But Iran has accused Israel of kidnapping and holding them in Israeli jails and covering up their fate. Also, Iran called on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to clarify their whereabouts. Israel has claimed that it is aware of the fate of diplomats, and that they were kidnapped by a Lebanese militant group and executed shortly after their abduction. It was believed (by whom?) that they were then buried at a site that was later obliterated by construction works. Three decades after the incident, the fate of the missing diplomats remains locked in a debate between Iran and Israel. Apart from this debate, many scholars have assumed that shortly after their abduction, they were executed by the Phalange.  Investigations  Adnan Mansour, Lebanese foreign minister, at a meeting with the families of the abducted Iranian diplomats said: \\"Beirut have sent the United Nations two formal letters in the past two years confirming the abduction of the Iranian nationals on the Lebanese soil and these have been recorded as official documents at the UN Secretariat.\\" The Lebanese justice ministry has been asked to submit a report on the latest investigations conducted into the case, vowing not to spare any effort at both national and international levels to resolve this painful issue. Former Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is quoted by Iran's Fars News Agency as telling U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon during a meeting in New York City: \\"Regarding the four abducted Iranian diplomats, there are documents that show they are alive and in the hands of the Zionist Regime.\\" He also added that: \\"We expected U.N. Secretary General to take serious measures for their release.\\" On 23 May 2016, Hossein Dehghan (minister of defense of Iran) stated that Ahmad Motevaselian and Iranian diplomats who disappeared in Lebanon, are alive and prisoner in the Israeli jails.

Europos ≈æmogaus teisi≈≥ fondas, pl. Europejska Fundacja Praw Cz≈Çowieka, rus. –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–π –§–æ–Ω–¥ –ü—Ä–∞–≤ –ß–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞) is an organization established in 2010 in Lithuania in response to the increasing number of human rights violations within the country of Lithuania, and more specifically regarding the rights of ethnic minorities.  History and mission of the organization  The activity of the EFHR focuses mainly on protecting and promoting the rights of ethnic minorities living in Lithuania, particularly the Polish minority which numbers at 6.6% of the total population. From the very beginning, the EFHR has struggled against laws forbidding the Lithuanian Poles using the original Polish spelling of their names in passports and other official documents, or of putting up Polish-language street signs. The Foundation also takes measures to prevent all forms of discrimination with special regard to the employment discrimination. The European Foundation of Human Rights was established during the growing legal uncertainty around the situation of ethnic minorities in Lithuania. As of 1 January 2010, the Law on National Minorities from 1989, which previously regulated minority rights, is no longer in force and no law has been adopted to fill the legal vacuum. However, Lithuania in 2000 ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities with no reservations. Attempts undertaken by the Lithuanian parliament to enact the relevant provisions have not yielded results. On the other hand, the controversial amendments to the Law on Education were adopted on March 17, 2011. According to Polish organizations operating in Lithuania new law restricts the right of minorities to receive education in their native language. These events were the impetus for the creation of the EFHR. As a result of the efforts of the European Foundation of Human Rights, one of the world‚Äôs biggest organization for democracy, Freedom House, has changed its report Freedom in the World 2013. In the section on Lithuania the statement \\"The rights of ethnic minorities,(...), are legally protected\\" was removed. Instead of that, Freedom House underlined that discrimination against ethnic minorities remains a problem in Lithuania.

The film follows scenes from the lives of each of the queens. Genevieve, Josephine, and Helen. Production The film had its genesis in a proposed television anthology series called Great Loves. Inspired by her success in Samson and Delilah, Hedy Lamarr and Victor Pahlen intended to produce the series about the love affairs of famous women throughout history. The episodes were to be directed by Edgar G. Ulmer who had collaborated with Hedy Lamarr in her production of The Strange Woman. The runaway production series was to consist of 39 half hour episodes photographed in colour with exteriors to be filmed on Continental European locations using frozen profits of American film producers. Star Hedy Lamarr was to be costumed by Haute couture fashion houses such as Jacques Fath and Dior. When the television series idea was shelved, three of the teleplays were put together as the film to be shot in Italy. The original director Edgar G.

It was designed by Axel Anderberg in the Jugend style and built in 1903‚Äì1907. History In 1901 the drawings were approved for a new church, which would relieve St. Peter's and St. Paul's parishes, where the population growth was large. Construction started in 1903, with a planned completion date of 1906, which was when St. John's Parish was founded. (That year is engraved in the sandstone above the main entrance). However, construction was delayed and the parish had to hold their first services in St. Paul's Church. The church was finally inaugurated by Bishop Gottfrid Billing on Holy Trinity Day, June 1, 1907. Designed in the Art Nouveau style, the church distinguishes itself considerably from those built in the new Gothic style around the same time. Art Nouveau had just become fashionable in Sweden and followed the National Romantic currents of the time. Architecturally, the Art Nouveau style meant soft, rounded forms and St. John's Church certainly shows examples of this. Architecture The church was erected in red brick on a granite base and the roof has enamel tiling. In all, there are approximately 20 different kinds of natural stone in the church's ornaments. To mark the arrival of a new era, the architect did not place the tower and the armoury on the west, as was the tradition, but on the north side of the church, just beside the sanctuary. St. John Church in Malmo (inner view) The Pulpit On the pulpit, there are five sections which are made of oak, carved by the sculptor Carl Andersson. These carvings are a description of the life of Jesus, showing the stable with Mother Mary and the Child Jesus, Jesus at the age of twelve in the temple, Jesus' baptism, the bearing of the cross and Jesus leaving the open grave.

History Foundation The newspaper was founded by Eladio Alem√°n Sucre on 1 September 1933 under the dictatorship of Juan Vicente G√≥mez. Eladio Alem√°n Sucre was forced into exile under the dictatorship, with the newspaper working under the area's best intellectuals, until Vicente G√≥mez's death in 1935. In 1948, the newspaper was headquartered in the Ayacucho building and by 1955, the newspaper had begun printing in a more \\"standard\\" size after their printing press was updated. Growth In 1976 after successfully growing, the newspaper moved into a new building on Soubrette Avenue in central Valencia. At the new facility, El Carabobe√±o purchased a new electronic system for processing that was one of the most advanced in Latin America at that period of time. In 1997, a newly built headquarters for El Carabobe√±o in Naguanagua, a city north of Venezuela, was inaugurated by President Rafael Caldera, who called the newspaper \\"an example for the Latin American Journalism\\". The headquarters was designed by Marisol Alem√°n de L√≥pez in a contemporary architecture, with the facility featuring an advanced electronic system, a museum on Venezuela's journalism, the original equipment used by the newspaper, two murals by Braulio Salazar as well as one auditorium and two convention halls at the Eladio Alem√°n Sucre Cultural Center. Cessation of printed newspaper Following nearly 83 years of printing newspapers to the Venezuelan public, on 17 March 2016, the newspaper released its final edition of its physical newspaper, discontinuing the use of printed material. On its final front page editorial, El Carabobe√±o explained that the government agency that has the responsibility of distributing newsprint had not attempted to sell the necessary resources to the newspaper. The act of withholding resources from media organizations was a common practice of censorship in Venezuela under the Bolivarian government. Awards and accolades El Carabobe√±o won the National Journalism Award in 1968, 1977 and 1983 and in 2009, the Inter American Press Association (IAPA) awarded El Carabobe√±o the 2009 Excellence in Journalism Award in the category \\"Newspaper in Education\\".

In 1770, Addis had been gaoled for causing a riot in Spitalfields. While in prison, and observing the use of a broom to sweep the floor, he decided that the prevalent method used to clean teeth at the timecrushed shell or soot with a cloth was ineffective and could be improved. To that end, he saved a small animal bone left over from the meal he had eaten the previous night, into which he drilled small holes. He then obtained some bristles from one of his guards, which he tied in tufts that he then passed through the holes in the bone, and which he finally sealed with glue. After his release, he started a business to manufacture the toothbrushes he had built, and he soon became very rich. He died in 1808, and left the business to his eldest son, also called William, and it stayed in family ownership until 1996.\\"History of ADDIS\\" Under the name Wisdom Toothbrushes, the company now manufactures 70 million toothbrushes per year in the UK.\\"New jobs joy in toothbrushes\\", cambridge-news.co.uk By 1840 toothbrushes were being mass- produced in England, France, Germany, and Japan.The company founded by Addis in 1780  Notes   References   External links  * Wisdom Toothbrushes Home Page Category:1734 births Category:1808 deaths Category:18th-century English businesspeople Category:English inventors ","title":"William Addis (entrepreneur)"},{"id":"44959386","text":"Iva Serdar (born August 26, 1982) is a Croatian female professional basketball player.

Andronikos is first mentioned on 19 November 1341, when, on the occasion of the coronation of John V Palaiologos, he was named megas stratopedarches. Soon after, John VI Kantakouzenos, embroiled in a civil war with the regency for the underage John V, promoted him to protostrator and named him as governor of the Rhodope mountains region and the fortress of Stenimachos. As soon as he reached his province, however, he declared himself for the regency. In this he was influenced by his family ties to one of the regency's leaders, the megas doux Alexios Apokaukos, one of whose daughters he had married. His father likewise transferred his allegiance to the regency at about the same time. In 1343/4, Apokaukos sent him against Kantakouzenos' loyalists in the area of Didymoteicho.

Location The building stands on the eastern side of Gda≈Ñska Street, at the corner with Krasi≈Ñski street. History The building, erected in 1912, has been designed by German architect Franz Julius Kn√ºpfer (1861 in Zeulenroda- 1915 in Bydgoszcz). He worked in 1886-1898 in Berlin and came in 1898 to Bydgoszcz where he met Heinrich Seeling when the latter was working on the project of Bydgoszcz theatre. Both were born at the same place in German empire. In Bydgoszcz, Franz Julius Kn√ºpfer also designed at the same period the plant \\"LEO\\" producing shoes, at the corner of Ko≈õciuszko and Chocimski Street for the Weynerowski family. The house originally had a large glass commercial premise on the ground floor. In 1917, the owner of the building was Boniface Cyrus, who ran here a department store and an exclusive fashion shop following the parisian mode, promoting fashions from abroad. In the 1920s, Boniface Cyrus organized fashion shows for wealthy clients in luxurious places like the Civil Casino, the Municipal Theatre and, from the 1930s, in his own apartments on the first floor at Krasinski street 2. At the end of 2017, a thorough refurbishing has been completed on both elevations of the building. Architecture Franz Julius Kn√ºpfer used forms of early classic modernism. Monumental forms are underscored by a combination: * bossage on ground and first floors; * vertical partitions using pilaster strips on the upper floors; * friezes at the edges. The facade on Krasi≈Ñski Street features some additional architectural elements: two bay windows, the entry gate topped with a triangular pediment flanked by two bowl shaped sculptures, and curved balconies. The ensemble has been entirely rebuilt in the 1920s. The building has been registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List, N¬∞601371 Reg.A/1090, on December 15, 1993.

The Mayfair was named after the exclusive Mayfair district of London. In renaming it as the Pacific, Packard associated the model with its personal luxury car offering, the Caribbean.

Speculation regarding this unusual arrangement suggests a connection with Cader Idris, where goats browsed and behind which the sun rose. The flag therefore both maintains a theme associated with Merioneth for six centuries and is also a highly distinctive design ‚Äì no other flag features a sun in this position and the arrangement is uniquely Merioneth.

Vedic interpretation NƒÅrƒÅyana Tƒ´rtha, in his SƒÅmkhya-CandrikƒÅ, explains adhyavasƒÅya as \\" a modified condition of the intellect (buddhi) the determination in such a form as ‚Äì such an act is to be done by me \\". GaudapƒÅda explains it as \\" intellectual determination of the object of perception as belonging to a definite class \\". VƒÅcaspatimi≈õra explains it as \\" ascertainment or determinate knowledge consequent upon the manifestation of the essence (sattva) of the intellect, when the inertia of the intellect is overcome by the operation of the sense-organs in apprehending their objects, as the intention which follows self-appropriated knowledge or volition of the agent to react to the object of perception in a definite way \\". Ascertainment also means definite awareness which according to the Samkhya school is associated in buddhi (‡§Ö‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§¨‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø‡§É), in perception which is definite ascertainment involving the senses with respect to specific kinds of empirical objects, and which is an activity of buddhi. It implies determination of objects (avidhƒÅranƒÅ) which by itself is decisive knowledge (ni≈õcaya). The sage of the Maitri Upanishad (VI.30) explains:- : ‡§∏ ‡§π‡§ø ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§É ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡•ã‡§Ω‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ø‡§∏‡§ô‡•ç‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§æ‡§≠‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§≤‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡•ã ‡§¨‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§É ‡§Ö‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§É |: \\" The purusha full of kama or desire is bound having adhyavasaya, sankalpa and abhimana as his lingas (characteristics) ; he who is the opposite of this is liberated. \\" VindhyƒÅvasin holds the view that sankalpa, abhimƒÅna and adhyavasƒÅya are not different functions but the modifications of the mind or intellect. Samkhyas hold the view that perception is the reflective discerning (adhyavasƒÅya), a kind of awareness, an operation of the intellect in its sattva modality; to be aware of perception as perception is to define and distinguish it from others which definition (adhyavasƒÅya) can come only through conception (vikalpa). Sadyojyoti defines discernment as the ascertaining cognitive activity (adhyavasƒÅya) which is understanding (j√±ƒÅna). Yoga interpretation According to the Yoga school and Ayurveda, adhyavasƒÅya i.e. apprehension of clear and clean knowledge of the knowable, is one of the sixteen qualities of the empirical soul (jƒ´vƒÅtmƒÅn). Lakshmi Tantra (XVI.4) explains that the intellect (buddhi) is the incentive to mental effort (adhyavasƒÅya); prana is the incentive to endeavour (prayatna) and time (kƒÅla) is the incentive to transform in the form of impulse and effective development; whereas ego (ahamkara) results from a modification of mahat in which cognition is indeterminate cognition (nirvikalpa adhyavasƒÅya). Jaina and Buddhist interpretation The followers of Jainism consider adhyavasƒÅya referring to good or bad sentiments, and of the nature of Bhava-Yoga which is made up of 'inauspicious combined meditation' and 'meditation'. Utpala in his following statement:- :‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡•ã‡§É ‡§∏‡•à‡§µ ‡§≠‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§∏‡§Ç‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡•ã‡§ö‡§∞‡§æ :‡§ï‡§•‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡§≠‡§ø‡§É |terms - adhyavasƒÅya as mental apprehension as he proceeds to explain mƒÅyƒÅ-shakti to be the differentiating power of Brahman that affects consciousness resulting in the false perception of duality. And, Ratnakƒ´rti holds the view that non-momentary existence is a figment of imaginative intuition projected as real by the process of intellection called adhyavasƒÅya which is impulsive movement of the mind generated by the force of immediately preceding cognition. The Buddhist view is that the judgment of the object of cognition ('spatio-temporal objects') owing to special synthesis of moments gains sensible qualities etc., to become universal (sƒÅmƒÅnaya lakshana, ekatva adhyavasƒÅya). J√±anasrimitra holds the view that only deluded persons interpret an image by conceptual thinking. (adhyavasƒÅya, vikalpa). AdhyavasƒÅya in Sanskrit literature Common characteristics (sƒÅdhƒÅranadharma) in poetry can either be in the form of existence (bhƒÅva) or negation (abhƒÅva), and can involve supersession (adhyavasƒÅya). In apahnuti (concealment of truth, denial), when a thing is concealed and something else is described in its place, the ƒÅropa (raising, elevating, superimposition) that is based on negation amounts to adhyavasƒÅya, which view is refuted by Jayaratha who agrees with Ruyyaka that adhyavasƒÅya is the phenomenon where the visayah is concealed and its non-difference (abheda) with the vishayin is known, and that doubt (bhrƒÅnti) is always based on adhyavasƒÅya and not on ƒÅropa. In Sanskrit literature, AlankƒÅra≈õƒÅstra deals with the beauty which poetry (kƒÅvya) alone can display. AdhyavasƒÅya is considered as siddha (accomplished) when the object is not expressed in words but is lost in comparison, it is considered as sƒÅdhya (perfect) when the object in the process of being represented is identical with the object of comparison. It distinguishes utprek≈õa ('alliteration') and ati≈õayokti ('hyperbole') from r≈´paka ('dramatic representation', 'form') and ƒÅropa ('superimposition').

Executed between 1494 and 1500, it comprises twelve panels illustrating the Passion of Christ; Holbein's monochrome palette is almost entirely grey. The paintings were purchased by the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, the Stuttgart State Art Gallery in Germany. The State Art Gallery acquired the altarpiece in 2003 for 12 million euros. The restoration of the artworks lasted three years and cost 450 thousand euros. Painting The series is considered one of the most important of Holbein's works. The Grey Passion was part of an altar painting, a triptych; its centerpiece was a sculpture by Gregor Erhart (ca. 1470 - 1540), now lost, and the wings each contained the six paintings. The Grey Passion was painted during Holbein's so-called Augsburg period, when he lived in Augsburg. In theme and treatment it is inspired by works of artists such as Dirk Bouts, the Master of Frankfurt, and Martin Schongauer. The aspect of this work that was different, and which is entirely specific to this work, is the grisaille painting style in which almost all colours were omitted except for shades of grey. Some reds and greens are used, while the underlying sketches were made with a silver pencil. The palette used by Holbein in the Grey Passion is unparalleled throughout European altar painting - the monochrome grey perhaps symbolises a theme detached from this world. Hans Holbein the Elder followed the example of Jan van Eyck and Hans Memling and their circle, who had experimented with painting in grisaille.

Initially working as a portraitist for the press and advertising campaigns he then jointly develop and pursue of his personal creative impulse. He is currently recognized in France and abroad as a contemporary photographer focusing on key themes such as identity and individualism in post-modern societies.http://www.christophe- beauregard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Christophe-BEAUREGARD_Bio-et-CV.pdf  Youth  He left home to complete further studies in 'English Literature and Civilisation' at Universit√© Fran√ßois Rabelais in Tours, where he focused on the narratives and the author's voices. Before completing his degree, Beauregard moved to Scotland in 1987 with the intention to teach French in a local high school. Aware of the Scottish mythological heritage, his newly found semantic approach encouraged a more dynamic creative urge. In search of an outlet, he attended painting classes and showed promising talent in portraiture. Encouraged by his teacher, Beauregard continued his creative search on his return to France. He enrolled himself at the School of Fine Arts (Ecole R√©gionale des Beaux Arts) in Tours in 1990 where he decided to specialize in photography. Using the photograph as his chosen medium, he presented his first line of work titled \\"Pinder\\" (after the French circus) as his final project. A black and white series of circus artists' portraits in an August Sander's manner.  Photographic career   Commercial Work  Following his graduation from Beaux Arts,http://www.charentelibre.fr/2014/07/22/ses-photos-font-mouche-jusqu-aux- etats-unis,1906230.php Beauregard moved to Paris in 1993 to start his working career as an assistant for Fabian Cevallos, a celebrity photographer. He was then admitted to work as an assistant in a paparazzi photographic agency, where he was responsible for the organisation of the studio as well as the selling of the photos (due to his proficiency in languages). Throughout the 1990s Beauregard expanded his commercial creative profession by supplying magazines and celebrities with photographs. Working for magazines such as Lib√©ration, Le Monde, and T√©l√©rama, Beauregard also landed assignments such as professional head-shots for large corporations such as LVMH, Publicis, and Havas. Taking into account the public exposure of the latter job opportunities, Beauregard also promoted himself by photographing the socially famous such as Richard Price, Erwin Olaf, Dan Graham, and Georg Baselitz.  Decisive Moment  In 2003 Nicolas Thely, an art critic from Le Monde, and H√©l√®ne Sirven, a professor of Fine Arts at La Sorbonne, prompted the offer to exhibit Beauregard's first artistic series, Chirurgies. Held at the Bureau d'Hypoth√®ses, salle Michel Journiac, From then on Beauregard decided to conduct jointly his commercial career and his personal artistic series.

personality is a recurring theme in Beauregard's work. Constantly questioning the principle of identity, the viewer is welcomed to participate in the act of deciphering.  Hush ... Hush  Hush...Hush provides insight into the daring world of the paparazzi. It suggests the distance a photographer of this profession is willing to go to capture the more profitable photograph. With Hush...Hush, Christophe Beauregard exposes a paparazzi photographer's ruthless techniques of disguisehttps://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/02/paparazzi- unloved-profession-major-french-exhibition that allow him to gain access to a celebrity.

Beauregard hired actors and a makeup artist to imitate the given situation. Incorporating theatrical aspects in his work, the power of perception is placed upon the viewer.  Devils in Disguise  Through this series, Beauregard depicts the correlation of a boy's imagination with the cultural idols and cultural goods. Thus trying to show how the imaginations of our offspring are formatted within the cultural industry.  Blindness and diversion   It's getting dark  This series, produced in the artist's studio puts tension in the body of women and men in a gesture of blindness. Beauregard asks them to cover their faces with clothing or fabric of their choice  Technomades   Le Meilleur des Mondes ?  The translation of the series is Brave New World? and it emphasises on The Basiliade Association which aims to provide help to individuals who have been diagnosed with AIDS. In an attempt to raise awareness of social stigmas Beauregard introduces us to a collection of an employee directory of a particular kind. In which men and women, seropositive and seronegative people, migrants and residents, and heterosexuals and homosexuals rub shoulders.  Skin and anonymous artialisation   Review  Review is a direct insight into the dual life led by several individuals who enjoy the art of theatre and music-hall. They are members of the Cercle Musical de Bergerac, an association of local civilians in France, who share a common enthusiasm for performance. They voluntarily write, choreograph, and design, both costumes and the set, before performing it in the local town hall.

Focusing on the cultural trend of body art and tattoos, it is interesting to see the reverse reaction. Acknowledging the fact that the title of this series is Italian for repentance in painting, Beauregard tries to photograph the space between the bodies and their homes.  Chirurgies  Pictorially playing with the chiaroscuro technique, Beauregard invites us to a darkened and mysterious encounter with anonymous individuals who have been treated with plastic surgery.

He directed Too Young to Die (2002), You Are My Sunshine (2005), Voice of a Murderer (2007), Closer to Heaven (2009), and Love Forecast (2015). Career Park Jin-pyo was born in Seoul in 1966. Upon graduation from Chung-Ang University's Film Department, he began working in television in 1991 as a documentary producer and director, eventually making over 30 documentaries for SBS and ITV. In 2002, he made his narrative feature film debut with Too Young to Die, based on the real-life story of Park Chi-gyu and Lee Sun-ye, a man and woman who fell in love in their early seventies then rediscovered sex. It became controversial for its sensitive yet honest depiction of sex between the elderly couple (who played themselves), and was initially banned from release by the Korea Media Rating Board. Park said, \\"I wanted to break the preconception about the elderly. Even if the body ages, desire for sex and thirst for love do not fade away. I wanted to capture the \\"moment of love,\\" and the audience accepted it as a cinematic expression of pure love. Some sees the (seven-minute sex) scene as a challenging of taboos, but I just wanted to deliver a love story.\\" Too Young to Die drew praise domestically and internationally, and was invited to various film festivals, including Critics' Week at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. Park was among six directors who participated in the 2003 human rights-themed omnibus If You Were Me. His short film Tongue Tied focuses on a young boy whose education-obsessed parents want him to undergo tongue surgery that will purportedly enhance his ability to speak English. His second feature You Are My Sunshine (2005) was a humanistic tearjerker about an innocent yet awkward farmer who falls for a dabang sex worker, then they later discover that she's HIV/AIDS-positive (the characters are again based on a real-life couple). Jeon Do-yeon and Hwang Jung-min won several acting awards for their lead performances, and Park was named Best Director at the 26th Blue Dragon Film Awards. Aside from the critical acclaim, the film ranked ninth overall on the year's box office chart, and became the highest grossing Korean melodrama at the time. Park continued to blend reality and fiction in Voice of a Murderer (2007), based on an actual 1991 kidnapping case of a young boy whose distraught parents (played by Sol Kyung-gu and Kim Nam-joo) receive threatening phone calls for 41 days. The boy's parents granted Park permission to make the film, with which he hoped to advocate extending the statute of limitations for child abduction-murders to longer than the current 15 years. Regarding the perpetrator, Park said, \\"You know what, I really hope he gets to watch this film. We want to tell him that we have not forgotten his wrongdoings. I focused on expressing what the parents might have gone through. So that 'he' can watch it and feel something.\\" Closer to Heaven, another unconventional romance between a man with Lou Gehrig's disease and his funeral director wife, also became a commercial success in 2009 and garnered acting awards for Kim Myung-min and Ha Ji-won. In a marked change from his previous work, Park's Love Forecast (2015) was a romantic comedy about a feisty weather reporter and her best friend of 18 years, a mild-mannered elementary school teacher (played by Moon Chae-won and Lee Seung-gi). He said he made the film in the hopes that it will \\"encourage young people to think more deeply about romantic relationships.\\" Filmography *Too Young to Die (2002) ‚Äì director, producer *\\"Tongue Tied\\" (from If You Were Me, 2003) ‚Äì director, screenwriter *You Are My Sunshine (2005) ‚Äì director, screenwriter *Voice of a Murderer (2007) ‚Äì director, screenwriter *Closer to Heaven (2009) ‚Äì director, screenwriter *My Burning Heart (2010) ‚Äì executive producer *Blood and Ties (2013) ‚Äì executive producer *Love Forecast (2015) ‚Äì director, screenwriter Awards *2002 21st Vancouver International Film Festival: Special Mention (Too Young to Die) *2002 5th Director's Cut Awards: Best New Director (Too Young to Die) *2005 26th Blue Dragon Film Awards: Best Director (You Are My Sunshine) References External links  * Category:South Korean film directors Category:South Korean screenwriters Category:Chung-Ang University alumni Category:People from Seoul Category:1966 births Category:Living people ","title":"Park Jin-pyo"},{"id":"44959798","text":"Thunaivan () is a 1969 Indian Tamil-language mythological drama film directed by M. A. Thirumugam and produced by Sandow M. M. A. Chinnappa Thevar. It was written by V. Balamurugan, while the music was composed by K. V. Mahadevan. The film stars Sridevi, A. V. M. Rajan and Sowkar Janaki in lead roles while Major Sundararajan, Nagesh, Sachu, Vennira Aadai Nirmala and K. B. Sundarambal are featured in supporting roles. The film marked Sridevi's first leading film role of her career at the age of five, playing Lord Muruga. It was partially filmed in Black & White and Eastman color, and was a commercial success, running in theatres for over 100 days. The film was remade in Hindi as Maalik. Plot Velayudham (A. V. M. Rajan), an orphan and a devotee of Lord Murugan lives in the Murugan Temple of Pooncholai town with the support of the priest Ponnambalam (Senthamarai). The temple trustee (Major Sundararajan) cones for a special Pooja and notices the ruby stone missing in the deity's spear. He blames Velayudham and beats him and threatens to send him out of the town if it not returned by him the next day. An upset Velayudham pleads with Lord Murugan for justice and since the stone could not be traced, Ponnambalam gives his relative contact in Coimbatore and tells him to leave the town to avoid getting any punishment from the trustee. The next day, Ponnambalam finds the ruby inside the temple and rushes to stop him but it is too late as Velayudham has already left by train. On reaching Coimbatore, he loses his bag containing the address of Ponnambalam's relative. Lost in a new place, he finds solace in a discourse happening there by Kirupananda Variar and believes that Lord Murugan will certainly help him. While buying Lord Murugan's portrait from Paramasivam (Nagesh) shop, Velayudham gets the address chit which he had lost and realises that the person he was supposed to meet is none other than Paramasivam. Velayudham gets a job from Bhama (Sachu), a fruit shop vendor close to paramasivam, and sells fruits on the roadside. He does very good business and saves up all the money. One day he gets help from Maragatham (Sowcar Janaki) in getting the money due from her friends, who try to cheat him. One day, Velayudham helps an old man (V. S. Raghavan) with epilepsy struggling at the Murugan temple. Velayudham's help and sincerity in taking care of the old man's briefcase full of money impresses him and he offers Rs.10, 000/- as a token of his appreciation. Using that money, Velayudham starts a fruit stall, which becomes successful. He later starts jewellery shop and many other businesses. He soon becomes a rich businessman in the city and helps many people with his wealth. Velayudham helps to retrieve Maragatham's stolen chain from his shop by a thief and she is very grateful. He chances upon the temple trustee on the road and invites him for lunch and the trustee comes with his daughter who to Velayudham's surprise is Maragatham. They both likes each other and the trustee notices this and proposes marriage between them. The marriage takes place and they commence a happy life. One day, Velayudham asks Maragatham to accompany him to the Murugan temple at his hometown for the annual Pooja but she refuses. She tells him that she is an atheist and Velayudham is God to her and her home is her temple. She does not believe in God and temples. Velayudham is shocked and carries on with his plan. One day Kirupananda Variar comes home and Maragatham refuses to take his blessings as she does not believe in Sadhus also. Variar leaves a letter advising him to let her be for now. Days pass by and Maragatham becomes pregnant. She delivers a very sick baby boy with birth defeats. Velayudham is shattered and keeps praying to God and blames her disbelief. Velayudham requests her to come with him to the temples with the child but she refuses. A year passes by and all doctors give up on the baby and finally her that only God can save the child without going to the temple and agrees to join him. They both start visiting Lord Murugan temples across many towns with the child. One day, while maragatham is bathing, a snake comes near the child and in desperation she calls out Lord Murugan's name and a peacock appears and takes away the snake. She realises the presence of God there and starts believing and joins Velayudham in praying for the recovery of her child. They both meet Kirupananda Variar and seek his blessings in one of the temples. Finally, they visit Tiruchendur Temple along with another Devotee (K. B. Sundarambal) and pray to Lord Murugan there. They both pleads to Lord Murugan by ringing the temple bell continuously for many hours and faint. Their prayers work and Lord Murugan (Sridevi) appears as a child and rings the bell. The bell falls down, breaking the floor and water seeps out on the baby. The child recovers and becomes normal making everyone happy. Velayudham, Maragatham and others pray to Lord Murugan for his blessings. Cast * Sridevi as Lord Murugan (Cameo Appearance) * A. V. M.

He was a painter and sculptor and was active until the last days of his life. Hazer Moshar was born in Rasht, Iran in 1923. At the age of 16, he was apprenticed to an Armenian carpenter and began making furniture as his profession. He pursued it until 70 when he had an accident and slipped into a coma. After recovery, he took up painting. Over time, he also became a sculptor. Since he had no workshop, he started making sculptures on the sidewalk and presented them for sale on site. Afterwards, he was discovered by Kambiz Deram Bakhsh, an Iranian caricaturist. He was introduced to the Iranian artistic community and his works were displayed in several galleries in Tehran, including Saba Art and Culture Organization, as well as XVA Gallery in Dubai. Though he had lost one of his eyes as a soldier in World War II, he had a keen eye in depicting nature and pursued it until his death. He learnt sculpture and painting by himself and, as a result, his works came purely out of his nature unaffected by the influence of academy and tradition. As Deram Bakhsh states, \\"Hazer Moshar is an old carpenter who did not attend academy and this might be his advantage.\\" Also, literature had a great influence on him. Hazer Moshar was highly interested in Persian literature. He knew Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, and made use of its stories as sources of inspiration. Moshar himself once said, ‚ÄúThe old stories are inspiration for my paintings. I make statues from the stories. I lived all my life with wood and by the wood.‚Äù He died in 2015 at the age of 91 after a very brief hospitalization. He had always proclaimed his hatred of retirement and he was successful in not experiencing it. On January 5, 2015, the body of Hasan Hazer Moshar was laid to rest in The Artists Section of Behesht-e Zahra Cemetery in Tehran. Nadia Hazer Moshar, who also is very talented, is daughter of Hasan Hazer Moshar. She got a son named Arian Ahadikoli, grandchild to Hasan Hazer Moshar.

It was produced by The Archive and Papagjika Salloway Productions. Entertainment One gave it a limited release on August 14, 2015. Plot After their daughter Hazel turns 18, Dee's ex-husband threatens to cut off child support unless Hazel will get treatment for her crippling agoraphobia. Forced to take a van ride to the treatment center, Hazel struggles to enter the van. Though they have clashed over Dee's hard-living lifestyle and Hazel's neuroses, Hazel is comforted when her mother offers to come with her. To accommodate Hazel's fears, the treatment center allows her to travel in a box, where Hazel will be able to isolate herself from others and her environment. While traveling through the desert, half-brothers Pru and Jesse attack the van to kidnap a wealthy heiress. Pru, mentally damaged from head trauma by his abusive mother, reacts erratically and shoots Dee. Although exasperated by the unnecessary violence, Jesse cleans up the scene of the crime by shooting everyone else but the heiress and Hazel, who remains hidden in her box. After Pru and Jesse leave, Hazel checks the others and finds her mother wounded but still alive. A map reveals a nearby reservation, which Hazel offers to travel to for help after applying first aid to Dee. After Hazel leaves, Dee finds a note written by Hazel that lists all the reasons why Hazel believes her mother to hate her. Hazel slowly makes her way through the desert, forcing herself to concentrate on simple goals, such as reaching one cactus after another. Her pill-taking ritual is disturbed by the dusty weather, and she must abandon some of her pills when they become too dirty for her to put in her mouth. She hallucinates the ghost of her dead sister, who she was unable to save in a drowning accident. When Jesse learns from an inside contact that one of the patients is agoraphobic, he realizes that it could not have been Dee, whom he initially assumed was a patient. When he and Pru return to the van, they discover Hazel's empty box, and Jesse leaves to find her. Dee, who has located a pistol in the van, takes Pru hostage. Meanwhile, Hazel runs into a junkie named Clete who quotes Aldous Huxley. Hazel eventually convinces Clete to help her, but his promised motorcycle turns out to have been disassembled. Despairing and not sure whether to further trust Clete as he begins to rant about women, Hazel pulls out pepper spray. Clete grabs it from her and in his craze pepper sprays himself, Hazel starts walking backwards away from him, trips on a rock and bumps her head. When Hazel wakes, she has been rescued by a kindly couple who found her just outside the reservation. They contact the police for her and offer to take her back to her mother. On the trip, they meet a representative of the treatment center, who says he was dispatched to locate the missing van. He convinces Hazel to allow him to pick up her mother and bring them to the treatment center. Despite the representative's protestations, the kindly couple follow behind him, reasoning that they can help protect her with their rifles. All converge on Dee's location at approximately the same time, where she is still holding Pru at gunpoint. Jesse, revealed to be the local sheriff, attempts to take control of the situation, but Dee warns the others not to trust him. The representative attempts to parlay with Dee, but when he makes a move to attack her, the couple opens fire, killing him, Jesse, and Pru. Hazel rescues the kidnapped heiress and tearfully reconciles with her mother. Cast * Bella Thorne as Hazel * Kyra Sedgwick as Dee * Frank Grillo as Jesse * Aaron Tveit as Pru.

Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 20% of 10 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.4/10. Metacritic rated it 36/100 based on seven reviews. Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, \\"Evan M. Wiener‚Äôs screenplay throws in too many disparate elements without developing any of them very effectively, while Grau‚Äôs direction is slick but unable to provide the tension or consistency needed.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film includes too many quirky characters, but Grau \\"captures [Thorne's] struggle with empathy and dignity\\". Andy Webster of The New York Times, although complimenting the other actors, said that Thorne is not ready to handle a lead role. Michael Rechtshaffen of the Los Angeles Times called it a \\"tedious waste of space\\" that seems to have been made up as the filmmakers went along.

He is described as ‚Äúone of the most distinctive figures of eighteenth century Oxford‚Äù, and is recognised as having been an influence on later landscape artists, including John Constable. Life and work John Malchair was baptised as Johannes Baptist Malscher on 15 January 1730, in St Peter‚Äôs Church, Cologne. He was the son of Elizabetta Roggieri and Joannes Malchair, a watchmaker. He became a chorister at Cologne Cathedral in 1744, which began his career in music. At the age of twenty-four, he moved to Nancy, where he worked as a musician and teacher, and began painting landscapes. In 1750 he came to England, where he was to spend the rest of his life. After initially working in London as a violinist and drawing master, he moved to Lewes, where he met and came under the patronage of the artist Robert Price. In the next decade, he spent time in Bristol, Sussex, Hereford and Wales. In 1760 he married Elizabeth Jenner. Later that year, perhaps assisted by Price‚Äôs brother-in-law, Shute Barrington, he was appointed as the leader of the Oxford Music Room (later to become the Holywell Music Room). He settled in Oxford, and worked as a drawing teacher, musician and collector of music, becoming a respected figure in the city. He resigned from the Music Room in 1792 following an incident in which his violin was broken by an orange thrown during a concert. In his later life, Malchair became blind. He continued collecting and composing music, which was notated by his friend William Crotch, the organist at Christ Church. Malchair died in Oxford in November 1812. Music collection and composition Alongside his work at the Music Room, Malchair took an interest in traditional ‚ÄòNational‚Äô music. He recorded the melodies that he heard in Oxford: including the music of military bands, the popular airs whistled by the townspeople, and the melodies of the singers and musicians in the streets of the city. He produced at least three volumes of collected music, one of which is in the collection of The English Folk Dance and Song Society.Robert J. Bruce. \\"Malchair, John.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 6 Jan. 2015. Malchair‚Äôs work provided the foundation for William Crotch‚Äôs 1808 work Specimens of Various Styles of Music. Some of Malchair‚Äôs own original violin and piano compositions survive in Crotch‚Äôs manuscripts, and owe much to the folk tradition. However, his most enduring musical work was a clock-chime composed for Gloucester Cathedral, where it can still be heard. Visual art and teaching Malchair was a talented watercolour artist, producing hundreds of paintings of English landscapes. His legacy is the collection of hundreds of sketches and watercolours of historical, architectural and topographical interest. His work features many of the mediaeval Oxford buildings which were destroyed following the passing of the 1771 'Mileways Act', and these paintings often provide a unique record of this architecture. Malchair was one of the most influential drawing masters active in Britain in the last two decades of the eighteenth century, Tate Gallery archive image caption: Barmouth,1795 with notable pupils including Sir George Beaumont, Heneage Finch, William Crotch, and John Austen, brother of Jane Austen.

History The school was established during the 19th century and came to prominence in the early 20th century when it was chosen by the Prince of Wales (later King George V) for his younger sons. During the Second World War it was evacuated to Shobrooke House, near Crediton in Devon,Cyril Cunningham, Beaulieu: Finishing School for Secret Agents (2005, ), p. xi and its head master, F. G.

At 4 a.m. on 23 January 1945, while occupied by some seventy St Peter's schoolboys and staff, Shobrooke House caught fire and was almost completely destroyed, with the death of two of the boys.Potpourri, from Exeter Express & Echo newspaper dated 23 January 1945, accessed 6 January 2015. After the end of the war the school returned to Broadstairs and was able to continue for many more years. In 1954 it had two joint head masters, the Rev. F. G. Ridgeway and C. C. Ridgeway, M.A., the number of boys was stated as 70 to 80, and there were ten teaching staff (\\"seven resident masters and three ladies\\").The Public and Preparatory Schools Year Book 1954, p. 643 In 1969 the school merged with another Broadstairs prep school, Wellesley House.

According to the 2014 report, agriculture, forestry and fishing were the sectors where child labor and forced labor were most common. Manufacturing, mining, quarrying and pornography completed the list. History Founded in 1947, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) has published numerous reports on the subject of labor, child labor, forced labor and forced child labor around the world. Since 2009, the Bureau has been issuing an updated List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor yearly. The report listed 122 goods from 58 countries in its first edition in 2009. In 2014, it listed 136 goods from 74 countries. The TVPRA List indicates the goods and countries where ILAB has recorded a significant incidence of child labor and forced labor without specifying the individual companies or businesses involved.The 2014 DOL report, Procedural Guidelines for the Development and Maintenance of the List of Goods From Countries Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor, Federal Register / Vol. 72, No. 247 / Thursday, December 27, 2007 / Notices - 73375 Exhaustive research has been conducted in order to provide a comprehensive list based on publicly available sources.Research Methodoly, the 2014 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor report, pp. 18-22.A comprehensive bibliography of the studies mentioned, listed by country. In 2009, the Bureau's research reported more goods produced by child labor than by forced labor. Agricultural crops represented the largest category of goods. In fact, the List had 60 agricultural goods, 38 manufactured goods and 23 mined goods. Child labor and forced labor were mostly adopted in the production of cotton in the agricultural sector, the making of bricks in manufacturing, and gold mining in the mining industries. In 2014, agriculture, forestry and fishing represented the largest category of goods in the list and 126 goods were reported to be globally produced by child labor in comparison with 55 goods produced by forced labor. Instances of such working conditions were observed in relatively the same sectors. In 2014, the List identified India as the country with the most goods produced by both child labor and forced labor with up to 25 goods listed. India is followed by Brazil (16 goods), Bangladesh (15 goods), Burma (14 goods), the Philippines (13 goods) and China (12 goods).

An action can be legal but not legitimate or vice versa it can be legitimate but not legal. Thomas Hilbink suggests that the power to compel obedience to the law, is derived from the power to sway public opinion, to the belief that the law and its agents are legitimate and deserving of this obedience. Where as Tyler says, 'Legitimacy is ...a psychological property of an authority, institution, or social arrangement, that leads those connected to it to believe that it is appropriate, proper, and just‚Äô (Tyler, 2006b: 375). Thus viewed, the legal legitimacy is the belief that the law and agents of the law are rightful holders of authority; that they have the right to dictate appropriate behaviour and are entitled to be obeyed; and that laws should be obeyed, simply because, that is the right thing to do (Tyler, 2006a; Tyler, 2006b; cf. Easton, 1965). Development of legal legitimacy Peter Kropotkin suggests that, Acceptance to rule of law developed in response to the rampant abuse of authority by the nobility; post advent of the middle class after the French Revolution, strict adherence to the law was conceived as the ultimate equalizer within society. ‚ÄúWhatever this law might be,‚Äù Kropotkin writes, ‚Äúit promised to affect lord and peasant alike; it proclaimed the equality of rich and poor before the judge‚Äù. To establish that a government action can be legal whilst not being legitimate; e.g., the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which allowed the United States to wage war against Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. It is also possible for a government action to be legitimate without being legal; e.g., a pre-emptive war, a military junta. An example of such matters arises when legitimate institutions clash in a constitutional crisis. Legitimacy is the right to rule and the recognition by the ruled of that right (Sternberger, 1968; Beetham, 1991; Coicaud, 2002; Tyler, 2006a; Bottoms and Tankebe, in press). Social institutions need legitimacy if they are to develop, operate, and reproduce themselves effectively (Easton, 1965). This is as true for the police as it is for other institutions of government. But peculiar to the police function is the statesponsored use of violence and force, the resolution of conflict, and the enforcement of legally-prescribed conduct and rule-following (Banton, 1964; Bittner, 1970; Reiner, 2010). Police legitimacy and public consent are necessary conditions of the justifiable use of state power: those who are subject to policing must see the police as right and proper (Tyler, 2006b, 2011a; Schulolfer et al., in press). By linking legitimacy to public compliance, Tyler's work generates a psychology of authorization and consent. The legitimacy of the police and the law leads to a respect for legal guidelines for action that dictates appropriate and personally binding behaviour. These guidelines may not be perfectly aligned with everyone's moral system. We do not always agree with the moral force of each and every law. But legitimacy involves the public recognition that the social order needs a system of laws that generate compliance and respect above and beyond individual preferences (or disagreements) with specific laws. When people believe it is morally just to obey the law, so long as they know that a particular act is illegal, then the immorality of illegal behaviour becomes a given. A different sort of morality ‚Äòkicks in.‚Äô Naturally, there are other reasons why individuals do (or do not) comply with the law (Bottoms, 2001). Limitations According to Lawrence Solum, since legitimacy has different shades of meaning and is undertheorized, it is very easy to make claims about legitimacy that are ambiguous or theoretically unsound so one needs to be extra care full before deploying the idea of legitimacy. Legitimacy and legal socialisation Compliance may be related in large part to habitual or routinized behaviours and orientations. If one complies with the law because such compliance is ‚Äòingrained in everyday life‚Äô (Robinson and McNeill, 2008: 436), it is unlikely that one will perceive breaking the law as an option when confronted with a situation which, objectively at least, offers such an opportunity. Equally, there will be those who are deterred by the presence of formal or informal mechanisms of social control. Genetic and psychological factors may be an influence; community context and effects might also be important; all these and other notions have been brought to bear on attempts to explain why people commit crime.

Built in 1894 and c. 1910 respectively, the buildings are the best-preserved and most architecturally distinguished of the community's surviving early civic structures. The town hall, in addition to its government functions, also hosted fraternal and social organizations, as well as community events. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The former Bridgewater Town Hall is a two-story wood frame structure, three bays in width, with a hip roof and weatherboard siding. The main (west-facing) facade has a central entrance topped by a relatively large transom window, and framed by pilasters and an entablature with cornice. The entablature and cornice are repeated at smaller scale above the sash windows that fill the remaining bays. The building's corners are decorated with pilasters, and an entablature encircles the building below broad eaves. The building is a well-preserved and little-altered example of late 19th-century civic architecture. The main entrance leads into a vestibule area, which includes a ticket booth and a storage area. The main hall fills the rest of the first floor, with a stage at the far end. The upper level of the building has a kitchen and dining area, and a second hall which was used by fraternal organizations. Adjacent to the town hall and on the same property stands the small jail. It is a small rectangular structure with a hip roof, fashioned from ornamental concrete blocks. It is a door at one end and a single window at the other. Bridgewater was incorporated in 1858. Its first meeting hall was destroyed by fire, prompting construction of this building in 1894. Soon afterward, a chapter of the International Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF) was formed, which acquired ownership interest in the upper floor. It was used by the IOOF and its sister organization, the Rebekahs, and later a local Grange organization, until 1942. The town originally used the ground floor for offices and meetings, but has since moved these functions to other locations. The ground floor is now occupied by local organizations including the historical society.

He was one of the architects of economic recovery from the economic crisis of the early-1930s and the economic set-back of the Japanese occupation during the early-1940s in Indonesia.  Origin in the Netherlands  Van Hoogstraten was born in Eerbeek on 26 March 1898. The ancestry of the Van Hoogstraten family reaches back to the 16th century. His father, Gerard van Hoogstraten (1870-1920), was a parson in the Dutch reformed church in Eerbeek. His mother, Amanda Augusta Schoch (1869-1951), was an editor and author of women's novels and other publications of a Christian-philosophical nature. Van Hoogstraten attended primary school and high school in nearby Apeldoorn. He graduated from his undergraduate law studies at the University of Utrecht in 1920.De Telegraaf (20 March 1920). As was common at the time, Van Hoogstraten later that year completed graduate studies with a Doctorate of Law after defending propositions at the same university.De Telegraaf (10 November 1920). After completing his military service, he was appointed to a position in the public service in colonial Indonesia in July 1922.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (24 July 1922). Before his departure to Indonesia, he married Johanna Wilhelmina ('Angy') Sanders (1900-1958) on 19 September 1922 in Lausanne (Switzerland).Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (21 September 1922).  Colonial public service, 1920s  Late in 1922, Van Hoogstraten started his employment at the General Secretary in Buitenzorg (now Bogor), in the service of the Governor General.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (11 November 1922). In Buitenzorg, Van Hoogstraten and his wife had four children: Gheret Samuel (1923-2008), Susanne Marianne (born in 1924), Jean Gustave Ulric (1927-1990) and Dirk Hans (1933-2002). He also served in the Regency Council of Buitenzorg advising the indigenous regents (bupati) from 1925-1928 and again from 1933‚Äì1935.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (15 October 1925 and 28 October 1933). He briefly worked at the Department of Education and Religion during the first half of 1927.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (17 December 1926 and 8 June 1927). As was usual in colonial Indonesia, after 6 years of public service Van Hoogstraten was granted 8 months furlough in 1928.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (10 January 1928). The family left in November 1928 and spent an expended leave period in Lausanne, returning to Indonesia in March 1930.Algemeen Handelsblad (19 December 1928; Het Vaderland (25 March 1930). Upon his return in April 1930, Van Hoogstraten re-joined the General SecretaryBataviaasch Nieuwsblad (25 April 1930). He was soon appointed as secretary of a committee that had to investigate news agency AnetaBataviaasch Nieuwsblad (24 May 1930). and later as head of the section for government publications.Sumatra Post (4 December 1930). The committee substantiated allegations expressed in parliament about lack of subjectivity in Aneta's press releases and the agency's misuse of its near-monopoly on facilitating access to news in colonial Indonesia.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (27 May 1931). It is not clear what Van Hoogstraten's contribution to the work of the committee was, but it may have been exceptional because he was appointed Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion in August 1931Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (29 August 1931). He then also became secretary of the Council of Department Directors in December 1931.Indische Courant (1 December 1931).  A religious man  Van Hoogstraten was a religious man and occupied social positions related to his faith. For example, during 1926‚Äì1928, he was Secretary of the private Committee for the Separation of Church and State (Commissie voor de Scheiding van Kerk en Staat).Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (19 August 1926). In the 1930s he was an elder in the Dutch reformed church in Bogor, and chaired the Bogor chapter of the Christian Constitutional Party (Christelijke Staatkundige Partij, CSP).Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (14 December 1932). As church elder, he participated in a proto-synod in April 1933.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (17 January 1933) which established the foundations for the reorganisation of the Dutch reformed church in Indonesia.Sumatra Post (18 May 1933). He also participated as speaker in several religion-related events of e.g. the Salvation Army and CSP in Jakarta, offered public speeches on topics like the separation of church and state, became a member of the governing board of the Dutch reformed church, and of the inaugural board of the theological high school in Bogor for the training of missionaries.Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indi√´ (29 April 1933); Indische Courant (3 July 1933 and 26 February 1934); Algemeen Handelsblad (23 August 1934).  During economic crisis and recovery, 1933-1941  In addition to being secretary of Council of Department Directors, Van Hoogstraten became secretary of the council's sub-committee for economic issues in August 1933. From then on, until 1950, his professional life became very time-absorbing. As secretary of the latter sub-committee, he attracted the attention of the new Department of Economic Affairs that was established in 1934 with Edmund P. Wellenstein as Director. In May 1934 he joined this Department as head of the section for foreign trade policy.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (31 May 1934). He was immediately attached to the Dutch delegation to the eventually inconclusive Hart-Nagaoka bilateral trade negotiations with Japan that took place in Bogor during September‚ÄìDecember 1934. From April 1935, Van Hoogstraten also doubled as head of the section for economic crisis measures. From May 1934, his professional duties multiplied quickly, and his religion-related social activities decreased. The main reason for Van Hoogstraten's increased work load was the fact that Indonesia suffered badly from the global economic crisis. Import restrictions imposed by trade partners caused significant surpluses of sugar, rubber, tea and other commodities, while the massive growth of imports of Japanese textiles replaced imports from the Netherlands and local production. His Department used government intervention in order to combat the crisis through the licensing of production capacity, and an intricate system of import quota to minimise imports by protecting and encouraging domestic production of manufactures and staple foods, particularly rice. Indonesia's import restrictions became increasingly detailed and also subject to regular negotiations with the Netherlands and with existing and potential trade partners such as India and Thailand (March 1936), Japan and China (May 1937) and Australia (November 1941). Van Hoogstraten participated or led delegations to these countries to discuss trade opportunities, bilateral trade concessions, as well as shipping connections. In addition, domestic import controls required regular consultations with local importers, such as with rice importers in Medan to explain the government's ban on rice imports in May 1937.Sumatra Post (10 May 1937). Import concessions granted by trade partners for particular agricultural commodities required controls over exports, as well as production and prices, through cooperation with several newly established semi-private associations of producers and exporters.Indische Courant (21 July 1937); Sumatra Post (30 July 1941). Nevertheless, after a further 6 years of public service, Van Hoogstraten was granted furlough during April‚ÄìOctober 1936. Presumably he went to join his wife who had already left for the Netherlands in October 1935 with their two youngest children.Indische Courant (20 October 1935). Upon his return to Indonesia, and still only in his late-30s, Van Hoogstraten was one of the senior officials in the Department of Economic Affairs in colonial Indonesia. When in 1937 Hubertus J. van Mook became Director, both of them worked closely together on shaping and implementing Indonesia's trade policies, to the extent that Van Hoogstraten became van Mook's Deputy in the process. It is likely that their collaboration was based on a shared belief that the future of Indonesia would be best-served if the Netherlands would grant it a higher degree of self-governance. Together, van Mook and Van Hoogstraten led the difficult further trade negotiations with Japanese representatives in respectively 1938 and 1940‚Äì1941. They also faced the difficulty that the Netherlands had little to offer Indonesia by way of securing international export markets. It largely fell to Van Hoogstraten to negotiate the principles and details of Dutch-Indonesian economic cooperation with the Dutch government during 1939‚Äì1940. This involved walking a tightrope between the interests of the Netherlands in foreign trade, and particularly in Indonesia's foreign currency earnings, and those of colonial Indonesia.  During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, 1942-1945  When the Dutch government appointed van Mook as Lt Governor General in January 1942, Van Hoogstraten became Director of Economic Affairs. Together with van Mook, he flew to Australia on 7 March 1942, just prior to the fall of Java to the Japanese. A month later, van Mook was called to London to become Minister of Colonial Affairs in the Dutch government in exile in addition to being Lt Governor General. He left Van Hoogstraten in charge of organising the Netherlands East Indies Commission for Australia and New Zealand. This was effectively the Netherlands Indies government in exile, located in Melbourne (Australia). It worked with the Australian government to prepare for the return to Indonesia after the war. As Minister, van Mook abolished the Commission in July 1944 and instead created several government departments, putting Van Hoogstraten in charge of the positions of Director of Economic Affairs and acting General Secretary of the Council of Department Heads (Raad van Departementshoofden), effectively the government in exile of colonial Indonesia. It worked with the US Allied Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, and set out to build the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (Nederlandsch-Indische Civiele Administratie, NICA), a public service that would be ready to move to Indonesia to assume civil administration after the war. Following van Mook's return to Australia in September 1944, the colonial government in exile moved to Brisbane, where it worked to prepare for the return of the colonial government to Indonesia after the Japanese surrender and the necessary relief and recovery activities.  During the decolonisation of Indonesia, 1945-1949  At the time of Japan's surrender, Van Hoogstraten was in the Netherlands, which had been liberated a few months earlier.De Maasbode (15 August 1945). He left immediately on 17 August to return to Indonesia.Financieel Dagblad (27 August 1945). Back in Jakarta in September and with NICA support, he took charge as Director of Economic Affairs of recovering the facilities of his Department and preparing policies for the postwar economic recovery of Indonesia. One of the Department's first measures was to take control and monopolise foreign trade through the Netherlands Indies Common Import and Export Organisation (Nederlandsch-Indische Gemeenschappijke Import en Export Organisatie), which had been established in Melbourne in 1944 to license all foreign trade and allow the colonial government to allocate foreign exchange earnings to crucial imports.Het Dagblad (14 December 1945 and 24 December 1945). Subsequently, Van Hoogstraten became involved in negotiating Indonesia's independence as a federal republic, which led to the completion of the Treaty of Linggarjati in November 1946. In the process of both negotiations and planning economic recovery, he had regular contact with his counterpart in the government of the Republic of Indonesia, Adnan Kapau ('A.K.') Gani, during 1946 and particularly in April‚ÄìMay 1947. Van Hoogstraten negotiated further details with Gani following the ratification of the Linggarjati agreement in March 1947.Vrƒ≥e Volk (14 May 1947). But his duties included many other tasks, such as representing the economic interests of Indonesia in the United States and the Netherlands.Vrƒ≥e Volk (16 October 1947); Het Dagblad (20 December 1947). Following the creation of the Provisional Federal Council of Indonesia in January 1948, the Council of Department Heads became the Provisional Federal Government of Indonesia in March 1948, in which Van Hoogstraten was State Secretary for Economic Affairs.Het Dagblad (12 March 1948). With the process towards independence apparently in place, he turned his attention to the urgent issue of foreign exchange shortages and planning for Indonesia's economic future, including reviving the industrialisation plans that the Department of Economic Affairs had created in 1941.De Nieuwsgier (30 September 1948). A year later Van Hoogstraten was a member of the delegation of the provisional government that negotiated the independence of Indonesia with the Republic of Indonesia during the Round Table Conference in September‚ÄìOctober 1949. His contribution focused on the discussions in the economic and financial committee, particularly the issue of bilateral financial transfers between Indonesia and the Netherlands.De Vrije Pers (21 October 1949).  Public service in colonial Indonesia 1933-1949  During 1933‚Äì1949, Van Hoogstraten's life appears to have been fully absorbed by his professional duties in the public service of the Netherlands Indies and Indonesia. He never reflected in public speeches or published interviews in any detail on what motivated him, but he appears to have dealt with a multitude of issues in a very pragmatic way. In the 1930s he seems to have been driven by a pragmatic understanding that colonial Indonesia needed a greater degree of political autonomy. He sustained this during the 1940s, seemingly concluding in 1946 ‚Äì like van Mook ‚Äì that Indonesia's independence was inevitable, and participating in the negotiations leading to the Linggarjati Agreement in 1946 and the Round Table Conference in 1949. At the same time, he initiated policies for the rehabilitation and recovery of Indonesia's economy during 1945‚Äì1949.  Personal life  His dedication to his professional duties during these intense years took a personal toll, as Van Hoogstraten's marriage did not survive. He probably separated from his wife in August 1939, when she returned to The Netherlands with their two youngest children.Indische Courant (13 April 1939). The family disintegrated further when Van Hoogstraten most likely had to leave his two eldest children in Indonesia in March 1942, where they must have been interned by the Japanese until September 1945. Van Hoogstraten and his wife divorced on 25 March 1947 in The Hague. A month later, on 26 April 1947 during a visit to Australia, he married Lucy Bell Donaldson (1907-1987) in Melbourne. She was the daughter of Major Robert J. Donaldson DSO, Vice-Consul of the Netherlands in Queensland, and worked for the Netherlands Indies government in Melbourne.Het Dagblad (26 April 1947); The Argus (28 April 1947).  After public service, 1950s  Following the transfer of sovereignty over Indonesia in December 1949, Van Hoogstraten returned to civilian life. From 1950 until his retirement in late-1958 at the age of 60, he was employed by the Foundation for the Representation in Indonesia of the Netherlands Manufacturing Industry (Stichting Vertegenwoordiging in Indonesi√´ van de Nederlandse Industrie).De Telegraaf (14 December 1951); De Tijd (1 September 1958). Based in Jakarta, he traveled the region as the general representative of the foundation for the Far East, Australia and New Zealand.  Awards  The Dutch government appointed Van Hoogstraten Ridder in de Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw in 1931 and Officier in de Orde van Oranje-Nassau in 1938.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (29 August 1931 and 30 August 1938). The French government made him an Officer in the Orde de l‚Äô√âtoile Noire in 1933Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (1 June 1933). and the Chinese government awarded him the Order of Brilliant Jade in 1938De Telegraaf (26 October 1938) and made him Commander in the Order of Brilliant Jade the next year.Indische Courant (14 February 1939). After retirement, he returned to the Netherlands and settled in The Hague, where he lived for over 30 years until his death on 17 March 1991.De Telegraaf (18 March 1991).

The theory of strategic pluralism was proposed by Steven Gangestad and Jeffry Simpson, two professors of psychology at the University of New Mexico and Texas A&M; University, respectively. As humans evolved, several trade-offs were prevalent, especially involving spending time and energy on child-rearing and mating. Gangestad and Simpson noted that even in species where male mammals offer little or no paternal investment, females still prefer some males over others for mating purposes. Ideally, a woman would attract and pair-bond with a mate that has both long-term providing benefits, while also carrying quality genes that are inheritable by her offspring. But since men that excel in both categories are very rare to come by, not all women will be able to secure such a man. The female preferences exhibited in situations where males are lacking parental investment can be attributed to good-gene sexual selection. Females observed in such conditions exhibited parallel behaviors as they revealed the tendency to select partners who were deemed genetically fit and reliable providers. Ultimately, as females evaluated males in this manner, it was evident that males who were on the positive side of the genetic fitness and reliability spectrums were favored as opposed to those who could not be such favorable mates for procreation. As a result, women evolved to prefer the men who exhibit viability and good condition, since such traits will likely be passed on to their offspring. This leads to most women facing trade-offs in their mating choice. Women often find themselves needing to compromise due to the unlikeliness of finding a male who is both genetically fit and willing to help in child-rearing. To solve the problem of these trade- offs, the theory of strategic pluralism says that women may have evolved to pursue a dual-mating strategy, whereby they secure long-term investments from one mate, while securing high quality genes from another (an extrapair) mate when they are ovulating. Male and female mammals have revealed their different priorities, as males track females for opportunities to mate, while females track their environment for the necessary resources for parental investment. Such discoveries regarding the different ways male and female mammals prefer mating with one another have suggested that females prefer more long-term relationships, while males prefer short-term. However, there are instances of both sexes displaying both short term and long term mating preferences in specific contexts.  Experiments and studies  Although strategic pluralism is postulated for both animals and humans, the majority of experiments have been performed with humans. One experiment concluded that between short term and long-term relationships, males and females prioritized different things. It was shown that both preferred physical attractiveness for short term mates. However females preferred males with traits that indicated that they could be better caretakers, whereas the males did not change their priorities. The experimenters determined using the following setup: subjects were given an overall 'budget' and asked to assign points to different traits. For long-term mates, women gave more points to social and kindness traits, agreeing with results found in other studies suggesting that females prefer long term mates who would provide resources and emotional security for them as opposed to physically attractive mates. The females also prefer males who can offer them more financial security as this would help them raise their offspring. Females have also chosen males who have more feminine appearances because of an (hypothesized) inverse relationship between a male's facial attractiveness and effort willing to spend in raising offspring. That is, more attractive males often put in less work as a caretaker while less attractive males will put in more work. On average, there is a wide amount of variability in male preferences than in females. This suggests there are enough of both males more suited for short-term relationships and those more suited for longer relationships.  Empirical Support  The strategic pluralism theory developed by Gangestad and Simpson has been empirically supported; however, there are still gaps of uncertainty which need to be filled. For example, the theory lacks information pertaining to the developmental processes which have influenced strategic variation in male and female mammals. Therefore, the biological reasoning behind the female evaluation of male partners remains unclear. Instead, research has only offered suggestions for why strategic selection occurs.

It includes buildings on Main Street, roughly between C and D Streets, along with a few buildings on C and D Streets between Front and East First Streets. The village was established in 1916 as a regional construction headquarters of the Alaska Railroad, and became a home to area miners after the railroad's completion. The district includes three buildings that date to the time of the railroad construction, and another ten that were built before 1940. Most of the buildings in the district are one or two stories in height, and are either of wood frame or log construction. Notable among them are the Fairview Inn, the town's first schoolhouse, now the Talkeetna Museum, and the Talkeetna Roadhouse, which was built as a residential log house in 1917 and expanded in the 1940s to serve as a roadhouse.

Biography Graduated in philosophy at the University of Milan in 1983, he received his Ph.D. in 1988 at Saarland University and Habilitation in 1995 at University of Trier. In 1996 he went to the U.S. to teach Kant and Hegel at the School of Philosophy of the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. In 2003 he came back to Italy to take up the chair of the History of Philosophy at University of Verona. From 2009 to 2012 he succeeded to Tullio Gregory at the direction of the Institute for the European Intellectual Lexicon and History of Ideas at the National Research Council of Italy. From 2012 to 2017 he directed the Department of Social Sciences and Humanities, Cultural Heritage of the National Research Council of Italy. In 2012 he was elected a member of the Institut International de Philosophie, of which he is currently vice-president. In 2019 he was appointed to the chair of the History of Philosophy at University of Rome Tor Vergata. Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany on ribbon, he has served as expert of the Horizon 2020 Program Committee Configuration Research Infrastructures, member of the Scientific Review Group for the Humanities of the European Science Foundation, and chairman of the 24th World Congress of Philosophy Program Committee, organized by the F√©d√©ration Internationale des Soci√©t√©s de Philosophie in Bejing 2018; he is currently a member of the 25th World Congress of Philosophy Program Committee Melbourne 2023. Research Historian of philosophy and author of monographs on Aristotelianism, the history of logic (from the Renaissance to Kant and Hegel), the history of ideas and the history of universities, Pozzo has pushed forward the creation of research infrastructures for an enhanced comprehension of philosophical and scientific texts that have shaped the cultural heritage of mankind. Specific characteristic of Pozzo‚Äôs approach to lexicography during his tenure at the Institute for the European Intellectual Lexicon and History of Ideas is the use of IT for linguistic and textual data documentation and elaboration in Ancient Greek, English, French, German, Latin, and Italian. History of Philosophy and the Reflective Society Like many other disciplines, today also the history of philosophy is taking a global perspective. Pozzo offers new definitions and stocktaking of best practices focused on European-Chinese cultural interactions, which can be taken as the start for extending the model to other cultures. Pozzo's research is about innovation, reflection and inclusion. Cultural innovation is something real that tops up social and technological innovation by providing the reflective society with spaces of exchange in which citizens engage in the process of sharing their experiences while appropriating common goods content. We are talking of public spaces such as universities, academies, libraries, museums, science-centres, but also of any place in which co-creation activities may occur, e.g. research infrastructures such as DARIAH-Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and the Humanities(http://dariah.eu). At this level, social innovation becomes reflective and generates cultural innovation. Social and Cultural Innovation The focus is on the introduction of the notion of cultural innovation, which requires adapting the process of co- creation, as it is pivotal for the theoretical framework. Here, the dimension of cultural innovation is contrasted against other forms of innovation. Pozzo has made an unprecedented attempt in pointing out processes and outcomes of cultural innovation while showing their operationalisation in some empirical case studies. Policy implications and verification strategies result from the final proposed definition. Humanities-led Cross-disciplinary Migration Issues Pozzo reflects on the methodological, conceptual and epistemological challenges of engaging in humanities-led cross-disciplinary research on migration. He elaborates on concrete examples as regards tackling migration as a domain that ignites a dialogue between very different disciplines such as sociology, narratology, media-studies, ICT, political science, social psychology, religious studies, economics, human rights, cultural heritage, museum studies, civil society organisations while using data available through research infrastructures, computational social science and digital humanities. Migration accompanies the whole history of civilisations, involving continuous relations and exchanges among cultures, hence translations through different linguistic, economic, political and cultural contexts. Migration offers compelling examples for the impact of cultural innovation because it implies transfers of cultures, knowledge and competencies. The epistemological challenges related to humanities-led cross-disciplinary migration issues are based on the aim of contributing to a change in the mindset as regards a culture of inclusion and reflection in target groups active in social infrastructures such as education, life-long learning, healthcare, urban development and regeneration.

Built in 2017, it follows several other Roanoke passenger stations that operated from the 1850s to 1979. History Early history By the time of its 1852 incorporation, the town of Big Lick was already established as a transportation hub for western Virginia thanks to its position on the Great Wagon Road and the Wilderness Trail. The Virginia and Tennessee Railroad was completed from Lynchburg to Big Lick that same year, and on to Bristol in 1856. The Virginia and Tennessee became part of the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad in 1870, which itself emerged from bankruptcy and was renamed as the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;) in 1882. The Shenandoah Valley Railroad was completed to the town (newly renamed Roanoke) from Hagerstown, Maryland in 1882, and acquired by the N&W; in 1890. Its unbuilt southern section was eventually completed as the Roanoke and Southern Railroad (the 'Punkin Vine') in 1892 and immediately leased to the N&W.; In 1905, the N&W; constructed a station to replace the half-century-old depot. The Virginian Railway was completed in 1909; a competitor to the N&W;, it ran along a separate route along the Roanoke River. The Virginian constructed its own Roanoke station to the south of the N&W; station; it served the Virginian until the end of passenger service in 1956. End of service The last train from Roanoke south to Winston-Salem on the 'Punkin Vine' was on February 18, 1961. Through sleepers were then still operated between Roanoke and New York (via Hagerstown and Harrisburg) on the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and the N&W.; The PRR discontinued service between Harrisburg and Hagerstown on February 25, 1962, and the N&W; between Hagerstown and Waynesboro on June 10; the sleepers were rerouted via the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. The last sleeper between Roanoke and Waynesboro ran on October 27, 1962, although local service continued until February 1963. This left Roanoke with only east-west passenger service for the first time since 1882. The N&W; continued to run trains, including the crack Norfolk- Cincinnati Pocahontas and the local station counterpart on the same route, the Powhatan Arrow. The N&W; also operated the north-south Birmingham-Washington Birmingham Special (unnamed after February 1970 and cut back to Bristol in August 1970) and the Pelican (discontinued, 1970) until April 30, 1971. When Amtrak took over most intercity passenger service on May 1, neither train was included in its basic system, and Roanoke ceased to have passenger rail service. 1970s Amtrak service The Mountaineer at Roanoke in May 1977 Service was restored on March 24, 1975, with the introduction of the Mountaineer service between Norfolk and Chicago. Unlike most stations on the route, Amtrak did not reuse the former N&W; station. Instead, an asphalt platform was built off Shenandoah Avenue near 4th Street, to the west. The Mountaineer was replaced by the Hilltopper on June 1, 1977. The Hilltopper was discontinued on October 1, 1979, ending rail service to Roanoke for the second time. For the next four decades, Roanoke's only link to the national railroad system was an Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach route that connected Roanoke to Lynchburg via the Crescent and later a Northeast Regional frequency. Current service An excursion train run by N&W; 611 passes the under- construction platform in May 2017 From 1996 to 2007, six studies examined the proposed Transdominion Express project, which would have created two intercity rail routes from Bristol to Richmond and Washington, both via Roanoke. The last of these predicted poor ridership and low farebox recovery, and the state government abandoned the idea. But the research also suggested that Amtrak should increase service along Virginia's busiest corridors. One daily Northeast Regional round trip was extended to Lynchburg in October 2009, supplementing the Crescent service. In 2008, Virginia's transportation regulator, the Commonwealth Transportation Board, outlined plans for expanded rail service in the state, including to Roanoke. Following the introduction of state-supported Northeast Regional trains to Lynchburg and Norfolk, the state reached an agreement with the Norfolk Southern Railway in January 2014 to spend about $93 million on infrastructure improvements that would allow passenger service to reach Roanoke. With the former N&W; station having been repurposed as the O. Winston Link Museum, a new station had to be built. Railroad construction was slated for 2015, improvements to the station and other facilities in Roanoke in 2016, and service would begin in 2017 with a single round trip departing Roanoke for Washington, D.C., in the morning and returning in the evening. Construction of the Roanoke facilities was delayed; a $4.9 million train storage facility was completed in early February 2017, and work on the $10.9 million station began later in the month, with completion scheduled for the end of the year. On October 31, 2017, after nearly 40 years, passenger service returned to Roanoke. The station consists of a single platform with a heated shelter. It is unstaffed, with no baggage service. All tickets must be purchased in advance; there is no Quik-Trak kiosk at the station.

Loyal friend and comrade of Rafael Carrera, was appointed army's Field Marshal after Carraera's victory against Salvadorian leader Gerardo Barrios in 1863. He was appointed Carrera's successor after the caudillo's death in 1865 even though Guatemalan leaders would have preferred Field Marshal Jos√© V√≠ctor Zavala. After the presidential elections of 1869, that Cerna won over liberal candidate Zavala, there were severe fraud accusations, and from then on Cerna's presidency was marred by constant uprising until he was eventually ousted by the liberal leaders Miguel Garcia Granados and Justo Rufino Barrios on 30 June 1871.  Biography  The facsimile of the act where Rafael Carrera is declared president for life of Guatemala; Cerna y Cerna was one of the signatories. Museo Nacional de Historia de Guatemala. Cerna y Cerna was from Ipala, Chiquimula where he later served as major and \\"Corregidor\\". He was a loyal friend and camarade of Rafael Carrera and was a distinguished officer of the caudillo's army. He was one of the Guatemalan officers in the Battle of La Arada as colonel, when he was Chiquimula in 1851. Later on, he was among those who signed the act that declared Carrera, \\"Guatemalan president for life\\" in 1854. His high army and government ranks allowed him to reach the presidency after Carrera's death in 1865.  Battle of La Arada  Salvadorian president Doroteo Vasconcelos granted asylum to many Guatemalan liberals, among which was Jos√© Francisco Barrundia who started a newspaper to attack Carrera's conservative regime. Vasconcelos also supplied money and weapons and supported for a whole year the rebels of \\"La Monta√±a\\" in the east of Guatemala. By the en of 1850, Vasconcelos grew tired of the slow war against Guatemala and decided to act openly. Then, he started a liberal crusade against the conservative regime of Guatemala and invited Honduras and Nicaragua to join; however, only Honduran president Juan Lindo accepted to join the invasion. Meanwhile, in Guatemala, where they well aware of Vasconcelos' plans, president Paredes made the necessary preparations for an invasion and archbishop Francisco de Paula Garc√≠a Pel√°ez asked his archdioceses to pray for peace. On 4 January 1851, in Ocotepeque met the presidents from Honduras and El Salvador, to seal the alliance against Guatemala. The Salvadorian forces were four thousand men well equipped and with artillery support, while the Honduras forces were two thousand men. The main force settled in Metap√°n, as this place was close to all three countries. The \\"Battle of La Arada\\", in which Cerna y Cerna had a brilliant role commanding one of the Guatemalan battalions, was fought on 2 February 1851 close to Chiquimula in Guatemala. The battle was the largest threat to Guatemala republican sovereignit; however, Guatemalan Commander in Chief Carrera's strategy resulted in a complete victory for his forces who only suffered 125 casualties between dead and wounded, while the enemy forces had more than 1500 casualties. After Battle of La Arada, on 22 October 1851 president Paredes resigned; the National Assembly then named Carrera his successor, being inaugurated on 6 de November 1851 after modifying the Constitution to suit his needs. Paredes went on to the army staff and was a loyal officer until his death in 1856.  Campaign against Gerado Barrios  In 1863 Honduran general Jos√© Mar√≠a Medina, along his Army Staff -which included Florencio Xatruch, and lieutenant colonel Juan Antonio Medina Orellana, were in talks with Rafael Carrera, who formed an army of Hondurans, Salvadorians and Guatemalans who, led by brigadier general Vicente Cerna y Cerna invaded Honduras. Cerna forces took Cucuyagua on 10 June 1863 and then \\"Los Llanos\\" de Santa Rosa on 15 June, eventually occupying Gracias a Dios and declaring Jos√© Mar√≠a Medina as President of Honduras;. Finally, Cerna and his men marched over capital Comayagua to overthrow interim president Jos√© Francisco Montes Fonseca. Government forces set Comayagua in flames before fleeing given the superiority of Cerna's army.  Gobierno  Several liberal authors, like Alfonso Enrique Barrientos describe Marshal Cerna's government as this: \\"A conservative and archaic government, badly organized and with worse intentions, was in charge of the country, centralizing all powers in Vicente Cerna, ambitious military man, who not happy with the general rank, had promoted himself to the Army Marshal rank, even though that rank did no exist and it does not exist in the Guatemalan military. The Marshal called himself President of the Republic, but in reality he was the foreman of oppressed and savaged people, cowardly enough that they had not dared to tell the dictator to leave threatening him with a revolution\\". It is necessary to make the following observations about the liberal comments: # By \\"conservative and archaic government, badly organized and with worse intentions\\", Barrientos means that State and Church were a single unit and that the conservative regime was strongly allied to the power of regular clergy of the Catholic Church, who then were among the largest landowners in Guatemala. The tight relationship between Church and State had been ratified by the Concordat of 1852, which was the law until Cerna was deposed in 1871. # Oppressed and savaged people: Barrientos refers here to the liberal criollos, who had not dare to rise against Rafael Carrera presidency (1840-1865). Even the liberal generals like Serapio Cruz had realized the undeniable Carrera's political and military presence who was practically invincible, and even fought under his command. Actually, the liberals waited for a long time until Carrera's death to begin their revolt against the more tamed Cerna. # The Army Marshal rank did exist in the Conservative Guatemalan Army: after the invasion to El Salvador, officers Serapio Cruz -Tata Lapo- and Jos√© V√≠ctor Zavala also were promoted to the Marshal rank, along Cerna. They all were of great importance to the military life of Guatemala during Carrera's presidency. During his presidency liberal party members were prosecuted and sent into exile; among them, those who started the Liberal Revolution of 1871. Around that time, Honduran liberal intellectual Ram√≥n Rosa lived in Guatemala and started publishing a newspaper called El Centroamericano (The Central American), a liberal pamphlet that strongly attacked the conservative regime. Finally, the Mexican president Benito Ju√°rez sent reinforcement to the troops in Chiapas, commanded by Miguel Garc√≠a Granados and Justo Rufino Barrios. After two devastating defeats on 23 June in Totonicap√°n and on 28 June in San Lucas Sacatepequez, Cerna resigned on 28 June 1871.

The film stars Patrick Wilson, Foley, Donald Faison, and James Carpinello, and features Amy Acker, Dagmara Domi≈Ñczyk, Marika Domi≈Ñczyk, Greg Grunberg, and Nicollette Sheridan in supporting roles. Foley, Wilson, and Carpinello produced the film, along with Joe Hardesty. The film follows three friends (Wilson, Foley, and Carpinello) who plan to kill their friend Ward's (Faison) abusive wife, Stacy (Dagmara Domi≈Ñczyk). The cast consists almost entirely of actors who are related to one another, with many being siblings or spouses. For example, Wilson is married to Dagmara Domi≈Ñczyk, who portrays the wife of Faison's character, and Carpinello is married to Acker, who portrays the wife of Foley's character. The film was released on video on demand on December 23, 2014 prior to its limited release on January 9, 2015. It has received generally negative reviews, with criticism aimed at its humor and portrayal of women. Cast * Patrick Wilson as David, an actor going through a divorce. He has a young child. * Scott Foley as Tom Bradford, a married man who works with Ward as a reporter. He also has an infant child. * Donald Faison as Ward * James Carpinello as Ronnie, an unmarried womanizer * Amy Acker as Geena Bradford, Tom's wife * Dagmara Domi≈Ñczyk as Stacy, Ward's abusive wife * Marika Domi≈Ñczyk as Amanda, David's ex-wife * Greg Grunberg as Bruce, a police officer * Nicollette Sheridan as Robin Peters  Production  Originally titled Ward's Wife, Let's Kill Ward's Wife was the first film directed by actor Scott Foley, though he had previously directed episodes of television series. Foley wrote the script in the early 2010s after having his first child. Realizing he was not keeping in close contact with some of his long- time friends, Foley concluded that spouses were the primary reason for friends growing apart in adulthood. He originally planned for the script to be \\"very heartwarming\\", but later conceived the idea to have several friends plan to kill one of their wives. After finishing the script, Foley sent it to James Carpinello and Patrick Wilson, his brother-in-law. Both agreed to appear in the film. Foley, who portrays Tom, had not originally intended to star in the film. However, the crew was unable to find someone they believed fit the part better than Foley, and he decided to play the part. The film's cast features a variety of Foley's close friends and family. His wife, Marika Domi≈Ñczyk, plays Amanda, the wife of Wilson's character, while Wilson's wife Dagmara Domi≈Ñczyk portrayed Stacy, the wife of Donald Faison's character Ward. Additionally, Amy Acker, Carpinello's wife, played Geena, the wife of Foley's character. Foley and Acker's characters have a sex scene in the film, and Carpinello helped to direct those scenes. Principal photography took place over 12 days. Due to the film's small budget, the crew was limited to \\"a camera and a tripod\\", with no access to camera dollies or cranes. As a result, the camera remains static throughout the film, causing Foley and cinematographer Eduardo Barraza to include enough movement in the shots to keep viewers from \\"getting bored\\". In order to keep the budget down, the actors were paid the Screen Actors Guild minimum of $100 a day, although several cast members invested their pay back into the film.  Release  In September 2014, Tribeca Film and Well Go USA Entertainment acquired the rights to distribute the film in North American theaters. The film was released to video on demand platforms and iTunes on December 23, 2014, and in a limited release on January 9, 2015. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on March 3, 2015. , it has earned $31,371 in home media sales.  Critical response  Let's Kill Ward's Wife received generally negative reviews. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 17% approval rating, with an average score of 3.5/10 based on six reviews. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 21/100, which is considered to be \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a negative review, opining that it is \\"torturously unfunny\\" and criticized Foley's writing and direction, stating that \\"Foley hasn't a clue how to make these bougie ciphers interesting, much less how to extract anything funny, tense, shocking, relatable or observant from his banal scenario.\\" Chris Packham of The Village Voice agreed, criticizing the film for being \\"as vacuous and undeserving of regard as any of its characters\\". Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine praised Foley's direction, but stated that \\"[a]ny pretense of satire collapses by the film's midpoint, however, leaving only the contempt\\". He further criticized the film's female characters. In a more positive review, Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times praised Wilson's performance, as well as the film's \\"casual charms and deft timing of its appealing cast\\". However, he similarly criticized the film's second half, stating that \\"the film's pacing and narrative structure take a hit ‚Äî and never quite recover\\".

The film stars Leighton Meester, Debra Messing, Billie Joe Armstrong, and is the debut of Julian Shatkin. The film follows a cello prodigy, Reggie, and his latest caretaker, Eleanor, as they develop a friendship over the course of a summer in New York City. Filming took place over 20 days in all five boroughs of New York City, New York. Following a world premiere at the Raindance Film Festival in September 2014, and a US premiere at the Mill Valley Film Festival in October 2014, the film was given a limited theatrical release in March 2015. Plot In Brooklyn, 23-year-old Eleanor (Leighton Meester) breaks up with her failing and disloyal musician boyfriend, Dennis (Billie Joe Armstrong). She has to move out of Dennis' apartment and crash at a friend's place. Unfortunately, Dennis refuses to let her go and confronts her at her work where Dennis' tirade costs Eleanor her job. Eleanor tries to seek family support, but her family is not willing to help, so she crashes at her friend's place one last time before seeking a temporary job. In the Upper West Side Reggie, a cellist and all-round genius who is bored and skeptical, lives a solitary life as his parents do not have time for him and relegate caretakers to watch after him. His most recent caretaker had to go back to Panama so Reggie's mother, Barbara, posts an ad for a temporary sitter; Eleanor answers the call. Despite being a genius, Reggie is treated like a child. He does his best to get around his mother's arrangements by bribing the people in his life to spread the idea that he is obedient. Upon meeting him, Eleanor is touched to hear Reggie's composition Like Sunday, Like Rain and the two strike an unlikely friendship. As summer camp approaches, Eleanor tries to get Reggie to go, but he blows it off to hang in the city for the next six weeks. In this time Dennis stalks Eleanor, wanting to talk and get back together, however, Eleanor makes it clear that they are broken up. Dennis promises to get back at her for breaking his guitar, but he never returns. Later, while hanging at the park, Reggie becomes fascinated with Eleanor. Eleanor's father is terminally ill and she has to go upstate to see him. Eleanor originally plans go away for a few days, but Reggie suggests he go with her and they travel to her hometown. Reggie gets to see Eleanor's life and her dysfunctional family. Eleanor's sister works at a seedy bar, while her mother and uncle are care-free about Eleanor's father. Looking after Reggie's interest and unable to stand the situation at home, Eleanor takes him to a hotel to have some peace and quiet. There Eleanor tells Reggie how she met Dennis, the messy relations with her family, and that she nearly went to Juilliard to study the cornet. Reggie is intrigued that Eleanor can play. She explains she wanted to play the trumpet, but chose the cornet instead; she never made it to Juilliard due to lack of funds. Before they go to sleep, Reggie promises to write a cornet piece to include Eleanor in his single. The following day, Eleanor visits her father and Reggie can only watch from a distance, seeing Eleanor become very emotional. Dropping off the car she borrowed from her uncle, she is enraged at how he could be so nonchalant about the illness of his brother. Her uncle and mother become defensive and Eleanor storms out, declaring she will never return and escorts Reggie back home. As the summer is nearly over, Reggie has formed a close bond with Eleanor, but her job is only temporary and another sitter has arrived to take over. He has trouble accepting Eleanor's departure and wants her to stay. Eleanor feels the need to regroup at home to get her life back in order and they promise to stay in touch with each other before emotionally embracing. Eleanor kisses Reggie lightly and bids him farewell. Reggie resumes his lonely, privileged life, with Eleanor on his mind. On the doorstep of Eleanor's family home, Reggie arranges a gift for her: a cornet with the revised notes to Like Sunday, Like Rain. Reggie resumes playing the cello and, at a distance, Eleanor plays her part. Cast Production Like Sunday, Like Rain is Frank Whaley's fourth feature film. Whaley was inspired to tell a good story, and interested in the subject of \\"childhood, and the loneliness and feelings of isolation and hopelessness that can sometimes accompany it\\". His main source of inspiration was New York City, saying > I lived in New York City for over 30 years and was always fascinated by the > lives of people there, how they drift in and out of each other's paths, > sometimes for only a short time. But these sort of encounters can have a > lasting impression. 'Like Sunday, Like Rain' is a story about two people > from opposite ends of the universe who just happen to meet one day.\\" Whaley says the biggest challenge with this film was to stay true to the story through the entire process and not change it based on investors' perspectives. The film was shot in New York City, New York in 20 days, including September 2013. Filming took place in all five boroughs of the city, Yonkers, and Long Island. English singer-songwriter, Ed Harcourt was the composer of the film's orchestral score. Release The film had its world premiere at the Raindance Film Festival in the United Kingdom on September 24, 2014. Its US premiere was held on October 6, 2014 at Mill Valley Film Festival.

On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, it has a score of 43 out of 100, based on six critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Neil Genzingler of The New York Times praised Meester and Shatkin, identifying the characters' relationship as a \\"well-played character study\\", while calling Messing's role \\"a grating caricature\\" and writing that the plot \\"thins out toward the end as it turns too obviously sentimental\\". Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times also praised Meester and Shatkin for \\"deftly navigating roles that could have become phony or clich√©d\\", and concluded: \\"A touching ending caps a quite wonderful journey, one that's greatly enhanced by Jimi Jones' fine camera work and a lovely score by Ed Harcourt\\". Jess Hassenger for The A.V. Club gave the film a C+ rating, writing that the film \\"morph[s] into a quieter, more reflective version of the Brittany Murphy/Dakota Fanning comedy Uptown Girls.\\" John Hartl of The Seattle Times gave the film 2.5/4 stars, writing of the ending, \\"The pace slows, the music swells and Whaley's script threatens to turn sentimental and evasive. Whaley has made a provocative, well-acted movie about infatuations that turn awkward, but he struggles\\". Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter thought the film \\"shows an initial glimmer of promise\\", but ultimately it's \\"playful tone and passable performances can't overcome an unremarkable premise and predictable plotting\\". Writing for The Village Voice, Nick Schager said the film \\"boasts what may be the most insufferably precocious protagonist in cinema history\\". Wes Greene of Slant gave the film 1 out of 4 stars, writing \\"Despite all the supposed goodwill Whaley wrings out of Eleanor and Reggie's mutually spirit-enriching friendship, the film evinces a perpetual streak of cynicism\\". The film won six awards at the 2014 Williamsburg Independent Film Festival, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress and Featured Actors - Leighton Meester, Billie Joe Armstrong and Debra Messing.

With a history of native Balinese kingship spanning from the early 10th to early 20th centuries, Balinese kingdoms demonstrated sophisticated Balinese court culture where native elements of spirit and ancestral reverence combined with Hindu influences ‚Äì adopted from India through ancient Java intermediary ‚Äì flourished, enriched and shaped the Balinese culture. Because of its proximity and close cultural relations with the neighbouring Java island during the Indonesian Hindu-Buddhist period, the history of Bali Kingdom was often intertwined and heavily influenced by its Javanese counterparts, from Medang c. 9th century to Majapahit empire in 13th to 15th centuries. The culture, language, arts and architecture of the island was influenced by Java. Javanese influences and presences grew even stronger prompted with the fall of Majapahit empire in the late 15th century. After the empire fell to its Muslim vassal of Demak Sultanate, a number of Hindu Majapahit courtiers, nobles, priests and artisans, found refuge on the island of Bali. As a result, Bali became what historian Ramesh Chandra Majumdar describes as the last stronghold of Indo-Javanese culture and civilisation. The Balinese Kingdom in subsequent centuries expanded their influence to neighbouring islands. The Balinese Kingdom of Gelgel for example extended their influences to Blambangan region in eastern end of Java, neighbouring island of Lombok, as far as western part of Sumbawa island, while Karangasem established their rule on western Lombok in later period. Since the mid-19th century, the colonial state of Dutch East Indies began its involvements in Bali, as they launched their campaign against Balinese minor kingdoms one by one. By the early 20th century, the Dutch has completed their conquest of Bali as these minor kingdoms fell under their control, either by force resulted in Puputan fighting followed by mass ritual suicide, or surrendered graciously to the Dutch. Either way, despite some of these Balinese royal houses still surviving, these events ended a millennium of the native Balinese independent kingdoms, as the local government changed to Dutch colonial administration, and later to provincial government of Bali within the Republic of Indonesia. History Prehistory Bali has been inhabited by humans since Paleolithic times (1 my BCE to 200,000 BCE), testified by the finding of ancient tools such as hand axes in Sembiran and Trunyan villages in Bali.Bali Museum noticeArchaeology: Indonesian perspective Truman Simanjuntak p. 163 Followed by Mesolithic period (200.000‚Äì3,000 BCE); however the ancestors of current Balinese inhabitants reached the island around 3000 to 600 BCE during Neolithic period, characterised by rice-growing technology and speaking Austronesian languages. The Bronze Age period followed, from around 600 BCE to 800 CE. Early kingdom Stupika which contains Buddhist votive tablets, 8th-century Bali. The bell-shaped stupas similar to Central Javanese Buddhist art. The historical period in Bali started c. 8th century, marked by the discovery of inscribed Buddhist votive clay tablets. These Buddhist votive tablets, found in small clay stupa figurines called \\"stupikas\\", are the first known written inscriptions in Bali and date from around the 8th century CE. Such stupikas have been found in the regency of Gianyar, in the villages of Pejeng, Tatiapi and Blahbatuh. The bell-shaped stupikas bears resemblances to the style of the 8th-century stupas of Central Javanese Buddhist art found in Borobudur and other Buddhist temples dated from that period, which suggested the Sailendra link to the Buddhist pilgrims or inhabitant of early Bali's history. The Belanjong pillar in Sanur (914), one of the earliest inscription in Bali In the early 10th century, a king called Sri Kesari Warmadewa issued the Belanjong pillar inscription found near the southern strip of Sanur beach. It is the oldest inscription found in Bali that names the ruler who issued it. The pillar is dated 914 CE according to the Indian Saka calendar. Three other inscriptions by Kesari are known in central Bali, which suggest conflict in the mountainous interior of the island. Sri Kesari is first known ruler to bear the Warmadewa title, which was used by rulers for several generations prior to Javanese expansion. It is not known precisely where the capital of the kingdom was during the 10th and 11th centuries, but the political, religious and cultural centre of the kingdom may have been in the present-day Gianyar Regency, inferred from the concentration of archaeological finds in this area.A.J. Bernet Kempers (1991) Monumental Bali: Introduction to Balinese Archaeology & Guide to the Monuments. Berkeley, Singapore: Periplus Editions. p. 35-36 The stone cave temple and bathing place of Goa Gajah, near Ubud in Gianyar, was made around the same period. It shows a combination of Buddhist and Hindu Shivaite iconography. Several carvings of stupas, stupikas (small stupas), and image of Boddhisattvas suggested that Warmadewa dynasty was the patron of Mahayana Buddhism. Nevertheless, Hinduism is also practised in Bali during this period.  Javanese ties  Gunung Kawi rock-cut candi shrines demonstrate similar temple style of Java during the late Medang period. In the second half of the 10th century, Bali was ruled by king Udayana Warmadewa and his queen, Mahendradatta, a princess of Isyana dynasty from East Java. Mahendradatta was the daughter of king Sri Makutawangsawarddhana, and sister of king Dharmawangsa of Medang Kingdom. The presence of a Javanese queen in the Balinese court suggests that either Bali had formed an alliance with East Java, or Bali was Java's vassal; their marriage was a political arrangement to seal Bali as part of East Javanese Medang realm. The royal Balinese couple was the parents of the famous king of Java, Airlangga (1001‚Äìlate 1040s). Airlangga's younger brothers Marakata and later Anak Wung√ßu rose to the Balinese throne. The rock-cut candi shrine of Gunung Kawi in Tampaksiring was made around the same period. It demonstrates similar temple style of Java during the late Medang period. The Warmadewa dynasty continued to rule Bali well until the 12th century with the reigns of Jayasakti (1146‚Äì50) and Jayapangus (1178‚Äì81). Contacts with imperial China were also important during this period. Chinese coins called kepeng were widely in use in the Balinese economy. In the 12th century, king Jayapangus of northern Bali is known to have married a Chinese princess, and has been immortalised through the Barong Landung artform as the effigy of the king and his Chinese consort. After the Warmadewa dynasty, their descendant and their link to Javanese court, there is no continuous further detailed information found about the rulers of Bali. It seems that Bali had developed a new native dynasty quite independent from Java. In the late 13th century, Bali once again appeared in Javanese sources. In 1284, the Javanese king Kertanegara launched a military offensive expedition against the Balinese ruler. According to the Javanese chronicle De≈õavar·πáana: \\"In ≈öaka 'bodies-sky-suns' (1206, AD 1284) he then sent emissaries to Bali to crush it, and before long its queen was overcome and duly brought as captive before the King\\" (42.1).Stuart Robson (transl.) (1995) De≈õawar·πáana (N√£garak·πõtag√£ma) by Mpu Prapanca. (Leiden: KITLV Press), p. 55 This expedition seems to have integrated Bali into Singhasari‚Äôs realm. However, after the Jayakatwang rebellion of Gelang-gelang in 1292 that led to the death of Kertanegara and the fall of Singhasari, Java was unable to assert their rule upon Bali, and once again Balinese rulers enjoyed their independence from Java. The Javanese contacts led to a deep impact on the language of Bali which was impacted by the Kawi language, a style of Old Javanese. The language is still used in Bali though is rare. Majapahit period Pura Maospahit (\\"Majapahit Temple\\") in Denpasar, Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture. In East Java, Majapahit under the reign of queen regnant Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi and her able and ambitious Prime Minister Gajah Mada, saw the expansion of Majapahit armada into neighbouring islands in Indonesian archipelago including nearby Bali. According to Babad Arya Tabanan manuscript, in 1342 Majapahit troops led by Gajah Mada assisted by his general Arya Damar, the regent of Palembang, landed in Bali. After seven months of battles, Majapahit forces defeated the Balinese king in Bedulu (Bedahulu) in 1343. After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers; Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit banner, he would become the ancestor of Balinese kings of Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Canto 14 of the Nagarakretagama, composed during the reign of Hayam Wuruk in 1365, mentioned several places in Bali; Bedahulu and Lwa Gajah (identified as Goa Gajah) as places under Majapahit dominion. The Majapahit capital in Bali was established at Samprangan and later Gelgel. Following Hayam Wuruk's death in 1389, Majapahit entered a steady period of decline with conflict over succession, among other was Paregreg war (1405 to 1406). In 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against King Singhawikramawardhana and captured Trowulan. The usurped king moved the capital further inland to Daha (the former capital of Kadiri), effectively split Majapahit into two centres of powers; Trowulan and Daha. Singhawikramawardhana was succeeded by his son Ranawijaya in 1474, that ruled from Daha. To keep Majapahit influence and economic interest, Kertabhumi awarded Muslim merchant trading rights on the north coast of Java, an action which led to the prominence of Demak Sultanate in following decades. This policy increased Majapahit economy and influence, but weaken Hindu - Buddha's position as the main religion, as Islam began to spread faster and freely in Java. Hindu - Buddha followers' grievance later urged Ranawijaya to defeat Kertabumi. In 1478, Ranawijaya's army under general Udara breached Trowulan defences and killed Kertabumi in his palace,Pararaton, p. 40, \\" .... bhre Kertabhumi ..... bhre prabhu sang mokta ring kadaton i saka sunyanora- yuganing-wong, 1400\\".See also: Hasan Djafar, Girindrawardhana, 1978, p. 50. Demak sent reinforcements under Sunan Ngudung, who later died in battle and was replaced by Sunan Kudus, but they came too late to save Kertabumi although they managed to repel the Ranawijaya's army. This event is mentioned in Jiwu and Petak inscription, where Ranawijaya claimed that he already defeated Kertabhumi and reunited Majapahit as one Kingdom.Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), pp. 448‚Äì451. Ranawijaya ruled from 1474 to 1498 with the formal name Girindrawardhana, with Udara as his vice-regent. This event led to the war between Sultanate of Demak and Daha, since Demak ruler, Raden Patah, were the descendant of Kertabhumi. In 1498, vice regent Udara usurped Girindrawardhana and the war between Demak and Daha recede. But this delicate balance end when Udara ask help to Portugal in Malacca and led Adipati Yunus of Demak to attack both Malacca and Daha.MB. Rahimsyah. Legenda dan Sejarah Lengkap Walisongo. (Amanah, Surabaya, tth) Another theory suggested that the reasons for the Demak's attacks against Majapahit was a revenge against Girindrawardhana, who had defeated Adipati Yunus' grandfather Prabu Bhre Kertabumi (Prabu Brawijaya V).Marwati Djoenoed Poesponegoro dan Nugroho Notosusanto. Sejarah Nasional Indonesia. Jilid II. Cetakan V. (PN. Balai Pustaka, Jakarta, 1984) The defeat of Daha under Demak marked the end of Hindu Majapahit era in Java. After the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests took refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java, Blambangan in eastern end of Java, or across the narrow strait to Bali. The refugees probably fled to avoid Demak's retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. The Javanese Majapahit empire influenced Bali both culturally and politically. The whole court of Majapahit fled to Bali following the conquest by the Muslim rulers in 1478, in effect resulting in the transfer of the whole culture. Bali was looked on as the continuation of the Hindu Javanese culture and is the major source of knowledge about it in the modern times. The incoming Javanese nobles and priests established Majapahit-style courts in Bali. The influx led to several important developments. The marriage of prominent Balinese families along with Majapahit royalty led to the foundation of upper caste lineages of Bali. Javanese ideas especially the Majapahit tradition influenced the religion and arts of the island. The Javanese language also affected the spoken Balinese language. The modern Bali architecture and temples share much in common with aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in East Javanese temples from the Majapahit golden age. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as Nagarakretagama, Sutasoma, Pararaton and Tantu Pagelaran, were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. As a result of the influx of the Javanese element, historian Ramesh Chandra Majumdar states that Bali \\"soon became the last stronghold of Indo-Javanese culture and civilisation.\\" Kingdom of Gelgel The gate in Gelgel, the old royal capital of Bali. According to the Babad Dalem manuscript (composed in 18th century), the conquest of Bali by the Hindu Javanese kingdom of Majapahit was followed by the installation of a vassal dynasty in Samprangan in the present-day Gianyar regency, close to the old royal centre Bedulu. This event took place in the mid-14th century. The first Samprangan ruler Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan sired three sons. Of these the eldest, Dalem Samprangan, succeeded to the rulership but turned out to be an incompetent ruler. His youngest brother Dalem Ketut founded a new royal seat in Gelgel while Samprangan lapsed in obscurity.I Wayan Warna et al. (1986), Babad Dalem; Teks dan terjemahan. Denpasar: Dinas Pendidkan dan Kebudayaan Propinsi Daerah Tingkat I Bali. The first European contact with Bali was made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio Abreu and Francisco Serr√£o sailed from Portuguese Malacca and reached northern coast of Bali. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues. \\"...passing the island of 'Balle', on whose heights the nau Sabaia, of Francisco Serr√£o, was lost. ..\\" - from Antonio de Abreu, and in Jo√£o de Barros and Antonio Galv√£o (D√©cadas da √Åsia). In Majapahit, East Java, the fall of Daha to Demak Sultanate in 1517 has prompted the refuge of Hindu nobles, priests and artisans to Bali. In 1585, the Portuguese government in Malacca sent a ship to establish a fort and a trading post in Bali, but the mission failed as ship foundered on the reef of the Bukit peninsula. By the 16th century, the Puri (Balinese court) of Gelgel become a powerful polity in the region. The successor of Dewa Ketut, Dalem Baturenggong, reigned in the mid-16th century. He received a Javanese Brahmin sage called Nirartha who fled from the decline of Hinduism in Java. The King become the patron of Nirartha, who carried out an extensive literary works that formed the spiritualism of Balinese Hinduism. Gelgel reached its apogee during the reign of Dalem Baturenggong, as Lombok, western Sumbawa and Blambangan on easternmost Java, were united under Gelgel's suzerainty. Gelgel's influence over the still Hindu Blambangan seems to caught the attention the Sultan of Mataram that aspired to unite the whole of Java and also to spread Islamic faith. In 1639 Mataram launched an invasion to Blambangan. Kingdom of Gelgel immediately supported Blambangan as a buffer against the Islamic expansion of Muslim Mataram. Blambangan surrendered in 1639, but quickly regained their independence and rejoined Bali soon after the Mataram troops withdrew. Mataram Sultanate itself, after the death of Sultan Agung, seems to preoccupied in their internal problems, and lost interest to continue their campaign and pursue hostilities against Blambangan and Gelgel. The nine kingdoms of Bali Map of Balinese nine kingdoms, circa 1900 After 1651 the Gelgel kingdom began to break up due to internal conflicts. In 1686 a new royal seat was established in Klungkung, four kilometres north of Gelgel. The rulers of Klungkung, known by the title Dewa Agung, were however unable to maintain power over Bali. The island was in fact split into nine minor kingdoms; Klungkung, Buleleng, Karangasem, Mengwi, Badung, Tabanan, Gianyar, Bangli and Jembrana. These minor kingdoms developed their own dynasty, built their own Puri (Balinese palace compound) and established their own government. Nevertheless, these nine kingdoms of Bali admitted Klungkung leadership, that the Dewa Agung kings of Klungkung are their primus inter pares among Balinese kings, and deserved the honourable titular as the king of Bali. Most of these kingdoms today formed the base and boundaries of Kabupaten (regencies) of Bali. In following centuries, the various kingdoms would fought a succession of incessant wars among themselves, although they accorded the Dewa Agung a symbolic paramount status of Bali. This led to complicated relations amongst Balinese rulers, as there are many kings in Bali. This situation lasted until the coming of the Dutch in the 19th century. Foreign intervention The Raja of Buleleng killing himself with 400 followers, in an 1849 puputan against the Dutch. Although European contact had been made since 1512 and later in 1585 by the Portuguese fleet, no real presence of European power was felt in Bali as the Balinese kingdoms continued their way of life preserved since the Hindu Majapahit era. In 1597, Dutch ships with Cornelis de Houtman arrived in Bali. A second Dutch expedition appeared in 1601, that of Jacob van Heemskerck. On this occasion, the Dalem of Gelgel sent a letter to Prince Maurits, a translation of which was sent by Cornells van Eemskerck. The letter granted the Dutch permission to trade in Bali as well as stating Bali's request to freely trade with the Dutch. This diplomatic letter of friendship and trade agreement was mistranslated as Balinese recognition of Dutch overlordship and was subsequently used by the Dutch to lay their claims to the island. Although the VOC ‚Äî centred in Batavia (now Jakarta) ‚Äî was very active in the Maluku Islands, Java and Sumatra, it took little interest in Bali, as the VOC was more interested in the spice trade, a produce scarce in Bali which was mainly a rice agriculture kingdom. The opening of a trading post was attempted in 1620 but failed due to local hostility. The VOC left the Bali trade to private traders, mainly Chinese, Arab, Bugis and occasionally Dutch, who mainly dealt with opium and slave trade. Dewa Agung of Klungkung in 1908. However, the Dutch indifference to Bali totally changed in the 19th century, as Dutch colonial control expanded across the Indonesian archipelago and they began to covet the island. The Dutch used the pretext of eradicating opium smuggling, arms running, Balinese tawan karang tradition (plunder of shipwrecks), and slavery to impose their control on Balinese kingdoms. The Dutch East Indies army invaded northern Bali in 1846, 1848, and finally in 1849 the Dutch were able to take control of the northern Bali kingdoms of Buleleng and Jembrana.Barski, p.48 In 1894, the Dutch used the Sasak rebellion against Balinese ruler of western Lombok, as a pretext to interfere and conquer Lombok. The Dutch supported the Sasak rebellion, and launched a military expedition against Balinese court in Mataram, Lombok. By the end of November 1894, the Dutch had annihilated the Balinese positions, with thousands dead, and the Balinese surrendered or committed puputan ritual suicide. Lombok and Karangasem became part of the Dutch East Indies.The rough guide to Bali & Lombok by Lesley Reader, Lucy Ridout p.298 Soon the court of Bangli and Gianyar also accepted Dutch suzerainty, but southern Bali kept resisting. In 1906 the Dutch launched a military expedition against the southern Bali kingdom of Badung and Tabanan, and weakened the kingdom of Klungkung, again under the pretext of Balinese tawan karang tradition (plunder of shipwrecks). Finally in 1908, the Dutch launched an invasion against the court of Klungkung, under the pretext of securing their opium monopoly. This event concluded the Dutch conquest over Bali, and by then it had become a Dutch protectorate.Bali and Lombok Lesley Reader, Lucy Ridout p.496 Although some members of Balinese royalties still survived, the Dutch had completely dismantled the royal institutions of Bali, destroyed the power and authority of Balinese kings and thus ended centuries of Balinese kingdoms' rule. During the Dutch East Indies period, the colonial capital of Bali and Lesser Sunda Islands was located in Singaraja on the northern coast.

On September 8, 2017, Japan Tobacco acquired Mighty Corporation's cigarette business in the amount of P46.8 billion ($936 million), paving the way for the full payment of P30 billion to the Philippine government as part of the agreement for Mighty Corporation to settle its unpaid tax liabilities. History In 1945, the company was established as La Campana Fabrica de Tabacos, Inc. by Wong Chu King with a small cigarette factory in Manila producing a type of native cigarette known as \\"matamis\\" (sweet blend). In 1948, a second factory was built in Barangay Olympia, Makati. In 1963, a facility for tobacco threshing and redrying was constructed in Malolos, Bulacan where the company's processing plant was later established. In 1985, the company changed its name to Mighty Corporation and acquired the trademarks of rival Alhambra Industries, Inc. in 1993. In 2001, the company entered into a cigarette manufacturing agreement with rival Sterling Tobacco Corporation to produce the latter‚Äôs brands. In 2004, the company entered into a cigarette manufacturing agreement with the Philip Morris Philippines as the latter had acquired the trademarks of Sterling Tobacco Corporation. The company increased its market share from 3 percent in 2012 to nearly 20 percent in 2013 as a result of consumer down-trading from premium (Marlboro, Lucky Strike, Winston) to low-end brands (Mighty, Fortune). The company endured accusations by rival PMFTC since the implementation of Republic Act 10351, more commonly known as the \\"Sin Tax Law\\", in 2012. In 2014, the company was engaged in talks with British American Tobacco (BAT), the smallest player in the Philippine tobacco market, to explore partnership options. In 2017, Mighty Corporation completed the sale of its cigarette business to Japan Tobacco in the amount of P46.8 billion. The transaction included the company's trademarks, intellectual properties, sales and distribution network, manufacturing equipment and inventories. It also resulted to the domestic manufacturer's tax payment amounting to P40-billion pesos - the largest amount paid in Philippine history by any corporation. The proceeds were to be used to boost the Duterte administration's infrastructure program. Tobacco trade war Since the implementation of Republic Act 10351 (Sin Tax Law), Philip Morris International (PMI) and PMFTC Inc. accused Mighty Corporation of various issues yet no formal charges or complaint have been filed while the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has clarified to maintain a neutral position in the ongoing tobacco trade war. BIR Commissioner Kim Jacinto-Henares officially stated that \\"the burden of proof rests on PMI and PMFTC, they should prove that Mighty Corporation has evaded the government. If they cannot prove their allegation, then they may be liable for libel or slander.\\" She said PMI‚Äôs current hurdles in the Philippine market could have been avoided if PMFTC agreed to the government‚Äôs original proposal of adopting a unitary tax system, which aimed to remove the tax rate gap between low- and high-priced cigarette brands. The BIR chief explained a unitary rate system on cigarette could have been prevented smokers from down-shifting from high-priced brands, such as Marlboro, Winston and Lucky Strike, to low-priced brands, like Mighty.{{dead link In 2014, a Bureau of Customs (BOC) administrative order suspended the firm‚Äôs customs bonded warehouse operations to assess and audit raw materials originally intended for export but were subsequently used for domestic production. After the assessment, the company paid a total of P978 million pesos. In March 2014, the BIR investigated Mighty Corporation for purported underpayment and unpaid tax levies. The BIR opted for the first time in its history, to field its personnel on a 24/7 basis to closely monitor Mighty Corp's operations. However, the tax agency reported no irregularities. In October 2014, acting Senate Minority Leader Vicente Sotto III pointed out during a hearing of the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee on the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program, citing apparent tax leakages, particularly in the tobacco industry. According to Sotto, Mighty Corporation appeared to have questionable figures in the importation of tobacco leaves, and that the company have not declared importation of acetate tow, the material used to make cigarette filters which could not be locally sourced, for domestic consumption until 2013. However, BIR Commissioner Kim Henares, who was in the hearing, opposed the Senate Tax Study Research Office (STSRO) data, which included the discredited information on alleged illicit tobacco trade furnished by multinational research firms AC Nielsen, the International Tax and Investment Center (ITIC) and Oxford Economics, as inaccurate, incomplete and not validated. She also added that the data used as basis for the STSRO report were biased and paid for by Philip Morris International (PMI) and that cannot be a basis against Mighty Corporation. Based on ITIC‚Äôs website, one of its directors is also a ranking official of Philip Morris. In early 2015, PMFTC declared it had to restructure its manufacturing operations in the country, cutting close to 700 permanent positions and has blamed it on a \\"market disturbance\\" said to be generated by Mighty Corporation over the last two years. However, BIR Commissioner Kim Jacinto-Henares had already exposed a flaw in PMFTC's arguments regarding their labor problems the year prior that it would not have happened had the tobacco giant agreed from the start to keep the government's original intent of implementing a unitary tax system for the industry. A unitary tax system means that all brands and price points would have a single rate and thus downshifting by consumers would, in theory, be mitigated. The non-government organization and anti-tobacco advocate group South East Asian Tobacco Control Alliance (SEATCA) has contradicted PMFTC‚Äôs claims of cooperation with governments worldwide need to be qualified. \\"For example, Philip Morris' collaboration with the European Union (EU) is the result of a 2004 legally binding out-of-court settlement by Philip Morris International (PMI) after it was sued by the EU for its involvement in tobacco smuggling,\\" SEATCA pointed out. \\"As part of this settlement, PMI agreed to pay $1.25 billion over 12 years to the EU to fight illicit tobacco trade. It is unlikely that a corporation would resolve a lawsuit for over US$ 1 billion unless they felt the case against them was strong.\\" SEATCA had also scored a Philip Morris-funded International Tax and Investment Centre and Oxford Economics joint report for using a flawed methodology and coming up with skewed findings that support the tobacco industry. PMFTC had also resorted to the use of \\"paid advertisements\\" to attack Mighty Corporation which violates Section 22 of the Republic Act No. 9211 (or the Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003). Allegations of using fake excise tax stamps Mighty Corporation allegedly used fake tax stamps on cigarette packs, after Bureau of Customs conducted raids on its warehouses. Using taggant readers, they scanned and confiscated cigarette packs with alleged fake excise tax stamps on in San Simon, Pampanga last March 2017but the company denied the allegations, stating that the confiscated cigarettes used officially issued tax stamps. Social involvement Mighty Corporation is engaged in corporate-social responsibility (CSR) work through the Wong Chu King Foundation, Inc. (WCKFI). As devout Catholics, the Wong Chu King family has been active in various educational and apostolic programs together with local churches in helping communities all over the Philippines since its inception. In 2014, WCKFI also launched a two- pronged community outreach program geared towards tobacco farmers and their families as an effort to save the local tobacco industry. The first one is the allocation of a P10-million peso budget to help modernize tobacco farmers that have no access to modern farming and irrigation equipment as well as a college scholarship program to aide 200 sons and daughters of tobacco farmers across two regions.

The 1965 British film The Heroes of Telemark, starring Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, was another version of the story. Ray Mears presented a documentary called The Real Heroes of Telemark in 2003. Despite mainly sticking to the factual evidence, some scenes in the documentary were partly dramatised, focusing on the survival skills involved in the operation.

He fought in both World Wars and was decorated with numerous national honours. Early life Klap√°lek was born in Nov√© Mƒõsto nad Metuj√≠ in north-eastern Bohemia, then part of Austria- Hungary. His father, a railwayman, died when Karel was eight. His mother was widowed with five children and the family was very poor. Karel went to primary school in the town of Kralupy nad Vltavou and high school in Prague, graduating in 1911 and taking a job as an accountant in a small factory that made automatic pumps. First World War In 1915 Klap√°lek joined the 8th Regiment of the Imperial-Royal Landwehr and was posted to Halicz in Galicia. He fought on the Russian front and was captured by Russian forces on 23 September 1915. Klap√°lek enlisted in the Czechoslovak Legion in Tashkent in 1916, and on 6 August 1916 he joined the 1st Artillery Regiment as a soldier. After the successful Battle of Zborov he was promoted to warrant officer. He served in the 3rd Czechoslovak Infantry Regiment, fighting in most of the battles of the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia before contracting tuberculosis. Klap√°lek returned to Czechoslovakia with the Legion in 1920. 1920‚Äì39 After World War I, Klap√°lek became a commissioned officer and helped to establish the army of the newly-founded First Czechoslovak Republic. He served in Plze≈à, Prague, Michalovce, and Uzgorod, where he met his future wife Olga Kosutova (born 8 March 1901). He then served in Milovice and at the Military Academy in Hranice. In the interwar period, Klap√°lek married Olga, and their daughter Olga was born on 24 March 1926. Olga Klap√°lkov√° kept a diary, which later provided the basis for a book in which she described life in a Nazi concentration camp in Svatobo≈ôice near Kyjov, where she was held in the Second World War. Later in life Olga also published her husband's memoirs, Voj√°k vypravuje. Second World War After Nazi Germany imposed the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939, Klap√°lek joined a Czech military anti-Nazi resistance organization Obrana n√°roda (Protection of the Nation) in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. After the organization was destroyed in 1940 he fled the country and reached Mandatory Palestine, where he joined the 4th Czechoslovak Infantry Regiment, later reorganised as the Czechoslovak 11th Infantry Battalion (East), with Klap√°lek as its commander. The battalion fought in the Allied invasion of Syria and Lebanon in June and July 1941, and was then stationed on the Turkish border in August. From October to December 1941 the battalion fought in the defence of Tobruk under the command of the Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade. After its success at Tobruk the battalion was withdrawn to the rear. In May 1942 it was reorganised as the 200th Czechoslovak Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, with Klap√°lek remaining as its commander. The regiment returned to the Levant, where it defended Haifa, Beirut and Az-Zeeb. Early in 1943 returned to Tobruk, which it defended until June. In July 1943 the regiment was transferred by sea to Great Britain, where it became part of the Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade. Klap√°lek reached Britain in August and was made second-in-command of the brigade. From March 1944 Klap√°lek was stationed in London as head of Department I of the Ministry of Defence of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. In August 1944 he transferred to the Soviet Union, where he commanded the 3rd Czechoslovak Independent Brigade. In September and October he led the brigade in the Battle of the Dukla Pass. In April 1945 Ludv√≠k Svoboda promoted Klap√°lek to commander of the Czechoslovak 1st Army Corps. Klap√°lek successfully led the army in the Battle for B≈ôest. On 17 May 1945 Klap√°lek returned to Prague on a white horse, leading the Czechoslovak soldiers who had fought abroad. 1945‚Äì56 Between 1945 and 1950 Klap√°lek served as an army officer in Prague. Along with Svoboda he supported the Communist coup d'√©tat of February 1948, by establishing the Central office of the National Front (). He joined the Communist party in June 1948. In the political trials of Czechoslovak soldiers who had served with Western forces, Klap√°lek tried to protect his former colleagues. In 1949 he received a threatening letter encouraging him to leave the country. Klap√°lek did not take it seriously, but in 1951 he was sent into retirement. After the huge political trial of Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω in 1952, the Communists confiscated all of Klap√°lek's property and arrested him in Valdice prison. He was disgraced, expelled from the Communist party, and deprived of his civil rights. In 1954 he was convicted of sabotage. Klap√°lek was released from prison in 1956 after the Soviet marshals Georgy Zhukov and Ivan Konev spoke in his defence, but he was not rehabilitated until 1968. Memoirs and national honours Headstone of Karel Klap√°lek and Olga Klap√°lkov√° in Ol≈°any Cemetery in Prague Klap√°lek published his memoirs in a book called Ozvƒõny boj≈Ø in 1968. Ludvik Svoboda, the president of Czechoslovakia, awarded him with the title Hero of the ƒåSR after having already received the Order of the Red Star and the Order of the 25th February (cs). Klap√°lek was designated an \\"honorable citizen\\" of his hometown, Nov√© Mƒõsto nad Metuj√≠. In 1984 he was awarded his last National Honour, the Order of the Red Flag. General Klap√°lek died 18 November 1984 at the age of 91. He is buried in Ol≈°any Cemetery in Prague. In 2009 Klap√°lek was nominated for the Order of the White Lion in memoriam. A public debate followed over whether he deserved the Order or not, given his actions in 1948. Czech President V√°clav Klaus eventually declined to give him the Honour.

The plant was fully decommissioned in 2002. The land occupied by the facility is planned to be auctioned by the government to private bidders in late 2015 or early 2016 on conditions that the property will be kept as a power-generation site. Rehabilitation of the facility was previously considered but such plans were dropped after it was deemed too costly to recommission the plant compared to constructing a new one in its place and the facility is already flooded. History Known formerly as the Gardner Snyder Thermal Plant, the Sucat Thermal Power Plant was commissioned on August 1, 1968 upon the completion of Unit 1 of the facility. Additional units were built on January 15, 1970, July 1, 1971 and July 31, 1972. In November 1978, the National Power Corporation acquired the facility from Meralco. In January 2000, Unit 1 and 4 was decommissioned but was preserved. Unit 2 and 3 were later decommissioned at a later time in January 2002. The Sucat Thermal Power Plant was decommissioned due to its emissions exceeding the limits set by the Clean Air Act.

Early life  Brandon Wardell was born in the Seattle area before moving to Northern Virginia when he was a child. He grew up in Fairfax, Virginia and attended Robinson Secondary School. Wardell was a frequent contributor on the ToonZone forum in his youth. After attending Robinson, Wardell briefly attended Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia, but ultimately dropped out to pursue a career in comedy.  Career  Wardell's career began at the age of 17 in early 2010 doing open mics, before being invited to comedy hours in the Washington, D.C. region. Garnering local success, Wardell was scouted to perform at SXSW in Austin, Texas and the Bridgetown Comedy Festival in Portland, Oregon in the Spring 2012, eventually leading him to be featured in The Washington Post in October 2012. In mid-2013, an agent in Los Angeles noticed Wardell through the Washington Post article, and scouted Wardell to be part of his organization. After spending two weeks at VCU, Wardell accepted the terms, dropped out of VCU, and moved to Los Angeles to further pursue comedy. After Wardell appeared on several podcasts, his work was noticed by Bob Odenkirk, who featured Wardell on his late 2014 live comedy album, Amateur Hour, in which Wardell is featured on the opening four tracks. While the album was well received, Wardell's performance received negative reviews, with many fans and critics questioning Wardell's presence on the album. One critic panned his performance, saying that Wardell starts the album off with a \\"thud\\" and \\"unmemorable bits\\". A writer for The A.V. Club found it \\"strange\\" that Wardell was included on the album. In 2015, he toured with Bo Burnham. He then became the host of Comedy Central's Snapchat series \\"Hot Takes.\\" On January 27, 2016 he made his TV debut appearing on the Comedy Central show @midnight. In addition to stand-up, Wardell has written articles for Vice, The Washington Post, and Four Pins. In November 2017, Wardell began recording a podcast entitled Yeah, But Still with co-host Jack Wagner. As of January 2020, the podcast ranked in the top 50 most popular podcasts on Patreon, with supporters pledging over $15,000 per month.

In 2013, Porter was included in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Young Cricketers squad ‚Äì he was already a member of the Essex Second XI. At the time, he was a part-time cricketer, and also worked as a recruitment consultant. He played club cricket for Fives & Heronians club in Chigwell, before moving to Chingford cricket club, taking 33 wickets at an average of 13 in the 2014 season, as Chingford took their maiden Essex Premier League title. He made his senior Essex debut in September 2014, taking the wicket of Darren Stevens with his fifth delivery in first-class cricket.

Measuring attendance is a significant concern for many organizations, which can use such information to gauge the effectiveness of their efforts and to plan for future efforts. In education and work In both classroom settings and workplaces, attendance may be mandatory. Poor attendance by a student in a class may affect their grades or other evaluations. Poor attendance may also reflect problems in a student's personal situation, and is an indicator that \\"students are not developing the knowledge and skills needed for later success\\".Cynthia Franklin, Mary Beth Harris, Paula Allen-Meares, The School Practitioner's Concise Companion to Preventing Dropout and Attendance Problems (2008), p. 3. For students in elementary school and high school, laws may require compulsory attendance, while students at higher levels of education may be penalized by professors or the institution for lack of attendance. In entertainment and social settings In entertainment and commercial settings, attendance is often measured to determine the success of an event as a form of entertainment. Attendance at sporting events is particularly well examined, as sports teams with attendance too low to generate revenue may be shut down or relocated. \\"Attendance figures, average attendance, and percentage of stadium capacity filled are important indicators of fan support and how much advertisers and partners are willing to invest in a team\\".Daniel McLean, Amy Hurd, Kraus' Recreation and Leisure in Modern Society (2011), p. 336. Attendance of other events, such as films, plays, and other performances, may similarly determine whether the production was a commercial success, and may influence the determination to make sequels or similar works. The expectation of certain levels of attendance at a particular kind of event is a significant factor in determining the seating capacity to be built into venues constructed for such events, and the distribution of events or performances.Ian Appleton, Buildings for the Performing Arts (2012), p. 138. If an event repeats, as with a series of games in a sports season or performances of a concert or show, \\"the aim though should be to spread attendance across less popular days, or extend performances over a longer period of time\\". Attendance is also measured and reported for a wide variety of other social events ranging from political rallies to religious services.William R.

Facts Anic Partecipazioni SpA and several other corporations (including Montedison SpA, Hoechst AG, Imperial Chemical Industries plc and Shell International Chemical Company Ltd) manufactured polypropylene, a substance used in packaging and labelling, some textiles, loudspeakers and polymer banknotes. Between 1977 and 1983 they had a system of target prices, and aimed to limit output to share the market according to quotas. Anic had a market share between 2.7 and 4.2 per cent. The Commission found that Anic was in the cartel and fined it 750,000 ecu. The Court of First Instance reduced the Commission‚Äôs fine, saying the Commission failed to establish correctly how long Anic was involved in the cartel. Anic cross appealed, seeking further fine reduction or full annulment of the Commission‚Äôs Decision, arguing the Commission failed to specify whether its alleged infringement was an agreement or a concerted practice. Judgment The Court of Justice upheld the General Court‚Äôs judgment. It was not necessary to distinguish agreements, decisions and concerted practices, as a long course of conduct could cover any of them. A concerted practice meant knowingly substituting competition with practical cooperation, and an agreement meant an expression of joint intention. But the two were not mutually incompatible.

For the last three decades of his life he lived and worked in Altlangsow (administratively part of Seelow) in the marshy Oderbruch region of Brandenburg. Life After a training as a Ceramics modeller at the Vocational Arts Academy in Sonneberg, St√∂tzer moved on to study between 1949 and 1951 at the Grand Ducal Arts Academy in Weimar, where his teachers included Heinrich Domke, Hans van Breek and Siegfried Tschiersky.

He later said he looked back on his years as a gardener as the happiest days of his life.Jones, p. 90. He never held a regular job nor had a Social Security number. His long-term lover (though with interruptions) was Joseph Yanoska, who appears in his movies under the name \\"Joe Yale\\"; they were called \\"sadomasochism's heaviest couple\\".Jones, p. 73.

Halsted was a good friend of Kenneth Anger, and he loved Scorpio Rising.Jones, p. 86. He said that \\"I consider myself a pervert first and a homosexual second.\\"Quoted in Siebenand, The Beginnings of Gay Cinema in Los Angeles, Dissertation, University of Southern California, 1975, p. 213, quoted by Jeffrey Escoffier, \\"Beefcake to Hardcore: Gay Pornography and the Sexual Revolution\\", in Sex Scene: Media and the Sexual Revolution, ed. Eric Schaefer, Duke University Press, 2014, . Also, he considered \\"sadism... more basic to my personality than homosexuality\\".Siebenand, p. 218, quoted in Jeffrey Escoffier, Bigger than Life: The History of Gay Porn Cinema from Beefcake to Hardcore, Philadelphia, Running Press, 2009, , p. 77. L.A. Plays Itself (1972) The movie begins with a shot of a sign at the city limits of Los Angeles, giving its population at the time (2,535,700). An overheard conversation contains the words \\"Los Angeles stinks.\\" Mists over the canyons of Malibu are seen. Halsted, taking a walk in the forest, sees a naked blond, who offers to give him head. Their sexual encounter is interrupted by shots of approaching bulldozers. (Halsted was concerned about development destroying the wild areas of the Santa Monica Mountains.) In the second part of the movie, an older man (Halsted) tortures a young innocent (Halsted's lover Joseph Yale). A voiceover states that the youth is a cowboy hustler just arrived from Texas. The youth is bound, beaten, and kicked. At the climax, he is fisted, with a closeup of a can of Crisco, usual lubricant for fisting at that time. (Yale refused to be fisted and a double was used.Jones, p. 83.) According to Halsted, this was the first time fisting was shown on screen. At the end, he is bound and left helpless in a closet. The action is not one continuous scene; it is punctuated by Halsted driving through Griffith Park, a gay cruising spot also featured in John Rechy's City of Night. In the park unidentified men appear, the camera focusing on their dirty pants, especially crotches (\\"baskets,\\" in gay slang) and asses. There are also interspersed newspaper headlines about weird cults and the Manson murders, ads pushing \\"101 varieties of meat\\", shots of hustlers, bums, vagrants, porn theaters. The film ends on shots of newspapers saying that a young man was found dead after being tortured. According to the film's cinematographer \\"Tom\\", there was no screenplay. Random footage was shot, which Halsted was capable of sorting out and putting in a sequence. Halsted described it thus: \\"It was okay to be openly gay, but to get into S&M; was another trip. One of the purposes of L.A. Plays Itself was to get S&M; and allied perversions out on the screen where people could look at them, think about them, analyze them, let it affect them, whatever they wanted, but not have it hidden anymore, and leave it open where people can deal with it easily.\\" He has been quoted as saying that the film was highly autobiographical. L.A. Plays Itself was a huge sensation when it opened in New York.Jeffrey Escoffier, Bigger than Life, p. 77. The movie was praised by Fernando Arrabal, William Burroughs, and Al Goldstein, but was misunderstood by most homosexuals and film critics.Review, \\"Brothers Under the Skinflick\\", The Village Voice, July 20, 1972 (reproduced in Jones pp. 119-123). After seeing it, Burroughs sought out Halsted to discuss a collaboration (Terry Southern was also involved) to film Burroughs' The Wild Boys as a hard-core porn film. The project was abandoned as financially unviable.Jones, pp. 84-85. A 2003 documentary, Los Angeles Plays Itself, takes its title from Halsted's movie. Sex Garage (1972) Sex Garage was a 35-minute black-and-white short. It was produced after L.A. Plays Itself was completed, but before its release; it was intended to accompany the longer movie. It takes place in an auto repair facility (garage). As it begins a woman takes her car to the garage for service, and performs fellatio on her long-haired mechanic boyfriend. A male arrives with a car for service, scaring off the woman, who has just reached her climax. He starts servicing the mechanic, and is forced to put on the woman's discarded panties. A long- haired, bearded biker arrives, wearing a dirty jockstrap. He fucks the man wearing the panties; the mechanic thrusts his head into a toilet. The biker ejaculates onto the motorcycle seat. Bach's Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring, performed on a piano, is background music, as is \\"When Tomorrow Comes\\" by The Emotions. There are many atmosphere shots of vehicles, of the Hollywood Freeway, and of billboards on Sunset Strip.Jones, pp. 31-32. Erotikus: A History of the Gay Movie (1974) Erotikus is a history of the gay pornographic movie, directed by Tom DeSimone. It is narrated by Halsted, seated in a director's chair, at first fully clothed, then naked, then masturbating. A double was used in the latter part, not out of modesty but to have a bigger penis and a more impressive ejaculation. He reaches a climax during a montage of cum shots set to Ravel's Bol√©ro.Jones, p. 34. According to the box cover of the Bijou Video release, Halsted, \\"dick in hand, narrates this survey of gay pornography, starting with the Apollo Physique magazines, which eventually evolved into 8mm loops and eventually into hard-core full- length movies.\\" It contains excerpts from Boys in the Sand, Dust unto Dust, L.A. Plays Itself, Confessions of a Male Groupie, Tarzan the Fearless, Classified Capers, The Collection, Assault, One (the first orgasm shown in a gay movie), and Yes (1969, the first explicit sex shown in theatres)., retrieved 12/5/2014.The comments on One and Yes are taken for an advertisement for excerpts from the film, reproduced by Jones, p. 191. The climactic fisting scene from L.A. Plays Itself was first included but deleted in later versions.Jones, p. 39. Halsted never forgave DeSimone for reducing his compensation because a \\"double penis\\" had been used. Also, DeSimone reused the shot of the Los Angeles Times headline \\"New Weird Cult, Link to Tate Murder\\" from L.A. Plays Itself but suggests, as L.A. Plays Itself did not, that there was a link between gay BDSM and the Manson murders. This was offensive to Halsted, who denounced the film in conversation and in print.Jones, p. 39 According to Al Goldstein, publisher of the pornographic tabloid SCREW, \\"frame for frame, it contains more sex than any gay film ever released\\".Quoted in an advertisement for the movie, reproduced by Jones, p. 35. Sextool (1975) Halsted's next feature, Sextool, was intended to be a crossover success. Like L.A. Plays Itself and Sex Garage, it was produced, written, directed, edited, photographed, and starred in by Halsted.William Moritz, \\"Sextool: Fist Fucking the Mind?\\", Entertainment West, March 28, 1975, reproduced in Jones, pp. 121-128, this information on p. 126. It is centered around a party where a relatively innocent-married young man discovers the diverse sex practices of a dozen people. Sextool explores a fantasy Los Angeles populated by policemen, boxers, leathermen, a sailor, and one questionably straight man squiring his American transgender paramour.Jones, p. 40. Whites are chauffeurs for the blacks, and two cops rape someone in the police station. The topic of the movie, according to Halsted, was \\"sexual politics.\\"Mike Itkin, \\"America's First Gay Family of S/M: Fred Halsted and Joey Yale,\\" Coast to Coast Times, August 22, 1978, pp. 20-21, 44, and September 12, 1978, pp. 14, 40-41. All reproduced by Jones, pp. 148-159. It has been described as an \\"art work\\" and not immediately appealing to those who watch gay porn for sexual purposes.Moritz, p. 127 Halsted chose to use 35 mm film, hoping the movie would get shown in art houses, but the film only puzzled or offended the theater managers. Few of the theaters that did show gay pornographic movies had 35mm projectors. As a result, the film received very limited distribution. The use of the more expensive film meant Halsted was not able to shoot much transitional material, leading to a choppy effect.Jones, p. 53. The Museum of Modern Art, as a result of the success of the showing of L.A. Plays Itself and Sex Garage, acquired a copy of Sextool for its collection.Jones, p. 56. Package (magazine) In 1976 and 1977 Halsted edited and published a magazine, Package, \\"A Journal of Men, Fact & Opinion,\\" according to its cover,The cover of No. 6 is reproduced in Jones, p. 170. containing sex news, contact ads, and stories of Halsted's erotic life. It is known to have published six issues.Jones, pp. 170-200 reproduces Halsted's columns from five of the issues. An editorial from No. 1 is reproduced by Jones, p. 106. El Paso Wrecking Corp. (1977) Halsted had an important role in El Paso Wrecking Corp., the second of the Working Man Trilogy directed by Joe Gage. After some drinking triggers a fight, Gene (played by Halsted) and Hank are fired from their job at the Kansas City Trucking Co.. Determined to land some other kind of blue-collar work, the two gay men begin looking and drive to El Paso but are often distracted by sex and water sports with the men they meet on their job search., consulted 1/5/2015. Some of the scenes of the original movie are missing in recent video releases., consulted 1/5/2015., consulted 1/5/2015. \\"When El Paso Wrecking Corp. first opened it caused big shock waves all across gay America, but since then it's picked up as easily as fashion, wear your jackets and chains.

Straight play and movie Halsted played a hustler in the play News for Tennessee by Joseph S. Caruso, produced at the Pilot Theater in Los Angeles in 1978. His lover Joseph Yanoska also had a part. Halsted had a cameo role in the 1979 movie Dribble (later released as Scoring)., consulted 1/3/2015., consulted 1/5/2015. Halsted's (sex club) Halsted's, located at 2453 Glendale Blvd., Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California,Flyers/ads for the club, reproducted in Jones, pp. 68 and 209. was, as he himself described it, a naked industrial space transformed into \\"a stand-up fuck club\\". Founded by Halsted, his lover Joseph Yale, and David Webb, the club had booths with glory holes, bunk beds, and a sling. Its most distinguishing characteristic was four truck trailers that were parked in the back inside a walled yard. (At the time, empty truck trailers were a popular venue for gay sex in the meatpacking district of New York City.Alex Garner, Positive Frontiers, September 11, 2012, \\"Artist Ben Cuevas Brings Westside Highway To Install: WeHo\\", retrieved 12/5/2014.Discussed in the documentary Gay Sex in the 70s.Escoffier, Bigger than Life, p. 91.) The club only lasted about a year; Halsted admitted that \\"Los Angeles did not have enough perverts\\" to support the club.Jones p. 68. Before it closed, he filmed there A Night at Halsted's. A Night at Halsted's (1982) A Night at Halsted's does not have a plot; it consists of a series of sex scenes at the club of the same name, preceded by a brief introduction and followed by a similarly brief conclusion. Except for these two parts, the sound of the movie is all in voiceover. The box cover of the movie states: \\"Only Fred Halsted could create a fantasyland where anything and everything goes, a place where you can meet the video stars of your dreams - and make them cum true! Glory holes, mirrors, slings, and other toys become a living playground for this orgy of tight, glistening flesh. Fred Halsted's crowning achievement.\\", consulted 12/26/2014. Later years Halsted was never to make another hit movie. \\"By the late 1970s, Fred was falling apart\\". He used drugs and drank. His lover, Joseph Yanoska, died of AIDS in 1986,Jones, pp. 70-74. after having said to Fred \\"You did this to me.\\"Jones, p. 103. Fred was despondent after Joseph's death.Jones, p. 74. He briefly advertised his services as an escort. He died in 1989 of an intentional overdose of sleeping pills. His suicide note said: \\"I had a good life...

History The church is believed to be dated to 12th century. During the 1400s, the church was burned. During repair, the present choir and sacristy were added. In 1568, the church was plundered by Danish troops under the leadership of Daniel Rantzau (1529‚Äì1569) during the Northern Seven Years' War and the church was restored. In 1729, the tower was added to the west side and replaced a former bell tower. The baptismal font in red sandstone is from the 12th century and is considered to have been made by the workshop of an anonymous stone master referred to as Bestiarius. The triumphal cross is from the 15th century. The pulpit was manufactured in 1649 by m√§ster P√§der Knutzsson. The current organ dates to 1885 and was made by √Ökerman & Lund Orgelbyggeri of Sundbyberg. Prior organs were made by Georg Hum in 1680 and by Jonas Wistenius (1700-1777) in 1774.

Early life Stalks was born on September 28, 1925 in Newark, New Jersey. Her brother is Calvin D. West, who in 1966 became the first African American to win a seat on the Newark City Council. She attended Rutgers University and New York University. Political career She began her political career in the early 1940s as Executive Secretary to Congressman Hugh Joseph Addonizio, working in the Newark congressional office. After Addonizio was elected Mayor of Newark in 1962, she became the Executive Secretary of the Newark Planning Board. In 1967, Addonizio appointed her to serve in his cabinet as Director of the Newark Department of Health and Welfare, the first African American to serve as a Department head in the city. A New Jersey Superior Court Judge later ruled that Stalks was not qualified for the post, which was later reconstituted to allow her to remain in office. She served as the Newark-Central Ward Democratic Municipal Chairperson, and as Co-Chairman of the Newark campaign of Governor Robert B. Meyner. In 1974, Stalks was elected Essex County Register of Deeds and Mortgages, defeating Republican William L. Stubbs. As a candidate for re-election in 1979, Stalks was nearly defeated after her Republican predecessor, Hymen B. Mintz, mounted a largely quixotic campaign to eliminate the office entirely. Stalks was running with Democratic Sheriff John B. Cryan, who was under criminal indictment, and 1979 was a Republican year with President Jimmy Carter with low approval ratings. Stalks won, but by only about 800 votes in New Jersey's largest and most Democratic county. She was re-elected in 1984 and 1989 by wide margins. She was elected President of the County Officers of the State of New Jersey 1984, and became a member of the National Association of County Officer‚Äôs (NACO) Human Services Steering Committee. Stalks served on the NACO Board of Directors. Stalks also served as Vice Chairwoman of the Essex County Democratic Committee. Criminal indictment and conviction Stalks was indicted on July 19, 1994 on federal bribery, extortion and theft charges relating to a public housing project where she served on the Board of Directors. Stalks was accused of giving businessman Anthony Zecchino, an alleged associate of the Lucchese crime family, a $1.5 million security contract in exchange for the kickbacks. She was also accused of using her position to give her husband, Frederick W. Stalks (December 7, 1922 - August 7, 2002), no-show jobs at Hill Towers, a 420-unit federally-subsidized low income housing project. At the time of her indictment, Stalks had already announced that she would not seek re-election to a fifth term as County Register, and had resigned her post as the Essex County Democratic Vice Chairwoman. On September 27, 1995, Stalks appeared in federal court to plead guilty. She had received as much as $200,000 in kickbacks. \\"This is an example of how corruption directly impacts on people who are disadvantaged, minorities who live in housing projects, which are supposed to improve the quality of life for poor people,\\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Larry Stephen. \\"Under her corrupt management, Larrie Stalks ran the place into the ground and it became a blight on the Newark landscape.\\" Later life In 2008, Stalks was among those who wrote letters to U.S. District Court Judge William J. Martini urging leniency for former Newark Mayor Sharpe James, who had been convicted on federal corruption charges. As part of Essex County's celebration of Black History Month in 2013, Essex County Executive Joseph N. DiVincenzo, Jr. presented Stalks with the Coretta Scott King Leadership Award. Stalks collects an annual pension of $32,119 from the State of New Jersey. Stalks' husband, Frederick W. Stalks, died in 2002. Her only child, Stephen F. Stalks, died on January 6, 2011 at age 59.

Chess was not well known and rarely played in the country prior to the early 1970s. After the organization's formation, the initial venue for matches was commonly Mulago Hospital or Makarere University, both located in Uganda's capital city of Kampala. The name change to Uganda Chess Federation took place after FIDE's involvement in 1976. In the late 1970s the UCF began publishing Checkmate, a pamphlet that helped foster wider interest in the sport. As of 2014, the UCF's president was Vianney Luggya.

Built in 1893 and expanded in 1897, the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria was razed in 1929 to make way for construction of the Empire State Building. Its successor, the current Waldorf Astoria New York, was built on Park Avenue in 1931. The original Waldorf Hotel opened on March 13, 1893, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had previously built his mansion. Constructed in the German Renaissance style by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, it stood high, with 15 public rooms and 450 guest rooms, and a further 100 rooms allocated to servants, with laundry facilities on the upper floors. It was heavily furnished with European antiques brought back by founding proprietor George Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe. The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening, it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling Delmonico's and Sherry's. Engraved vignettes of the original hotels c1915The Astoria Hotel opened in 1897 on the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street, next door to the Waldorf. It was also designed in the German Renaissance style by Hardenbergh, at a height of about , with 16 stories, 25 public rooms and 550 guest rooms. The ballroom, in the Louis XIV style, has been described as the \\"pi√®ce de r√©sistance\\" of the hotel, with a capacity to seat 700 at banquets and 1,200 at concerts. The Astor Dining Room was faithfully reproduced from the original dining room of the mansion which once stood on the site. Connected by the long corridor, known as \\"Peacock Alley\\" after the merger in 1897, the hotel had 1,300 bedrooms, making it the largest hotel in the world at the time. It was designed specifically to cater to the needs of socially prominent \\"wealthy upper crust\\" of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city. It was the first hotel to offer electricity and private bathrooms throughout. The Waldorf gained world renown for its fundraising dinners and balls, as did its celebrity ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel, Oscar Tschirky, known as \\"Oscar of the Waldorf\\". Tschirky authored The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the recipes of the day, including his own, such as Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict and Thousand Island dressing, which remain popular worldwide today. Background Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street (1885). On the right hand side are the residences of John Jacob and William B. Astor. The homes were later razed to build the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Hotel. Opening and early years of the Waldorf In 1799, John Thompson bought a tract of land roughly bounded by Madison Avenue, 36th Street, Sixth Avenue, and 33rd Street, immediately north of the Caspar Samler farm, for (US$2400) ¬£482 10s. In 1826, John Jacob Astor purchased Thompson's parcel, as well as one from Mary and John Murray who owned a farm on Murray Hill, in the area which is now Madison Avenue to Lexington Avenue, between 34th and 38th streets. In 1827, William B. Astor, Sr. bought a half interest, including Fifth Avenue from 32nd to 35th streets, for $20,500. He built an unpretentious square red brick house on the southwest corner of 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, while John Jacob Astor erected a home at the northwest corner of 33rd Street. William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street. His father was the millionaire developer, William Waldorf Astor. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt, who owned and operated the Bellevue- Stratford Hotel, an elite boutique hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife Louisa Augusta Kehrer Boldt (1860-1904). The original plans for the Waldorf were for a hotel with 11 stories. Boldt's wife, Louise, believed that 13 was a lucky number. She persuaded her husband to add two floors to the construction. William Astor's construction of a hotel next to his aunt's house worsened his feud with her, but, with Boldt's assistance, John Astor persuaded his mother to move uptown. The Waldorf Hotel, named after the little town of Walldorf, in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, the Astors‚Äô ancestral home, was opened for business March 13, 1893. Floor plan of the Waldorf Early on, the Waldorf was a laughing stock with its large number of bathrooms and was known briefly as \\"Boldt's Folly\\" after Boldt, or \\"Astor's Folly\\", with the general perception of the palatial hotel being that it had no place in New York City. It appeared destined for failure. Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood. Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. In the face of all of this, Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary's Hospital for Children the day after the Waldorf opened. The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register. Despite rain the night of the ball, the ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid $5.00 ($141 in 2017) for the concert and dinner. Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt donated the services of the New York Symphony Orchestra led by Walter Damrosch to provide the music for the event. Even with proper escort, women of the times generally did not venture into hotels, but those attending also toured the facilities. While Boldt made news by insisting the Waldorf's waiters be clean-shaven even though he wore a beard, his decision to hire young Oscar Tschirky was one of the key factors in the hotel's success. Oscar was personable, humble and very willing to tend to patrons' needs on an individual basis. More than thirty years later, Tschirky was able to recall the Waldorf's opening day and the names of many of the Social Register guests who made the hotel successful when it hosted the charity concert and dinner. Business soon picked up and the hotel earned $4.5 million ($126 million in 2017) in its first year, exorbitant for that period. By 1895, the Waldorf added a five-story addition. This brought the hotel's ballroom down to the main floor; the move brought many parties and dinners which were formerly held in private homes, into the Waldorf. Adjacent to the new ballroom was the Oak Room, where one could sit by large fireplaces where there were always logs on the hearth. In winter, waiters would offer patrons complimentary baked potatoes with butter. The hotel after the addition of the much larger Astoria wing (1915) Opening of the Astoria and consolidation When a decision was made to build a second hotel next to the Waldorf, truce provisions were developed between the Astors which reserved some proprietary rights. The plan design used corridors to join the two buildings and there was even a bond provision for bricking up the corridors should the need arise. On November 1, 1897, Waldorf's cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, opened the 16 story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site. The Astoria, named after Astoria, Oregon which was founded by John Jacob Astor in 1811, stood on the site of William B. Astor's house, and was leased to Boldt. The two hotels, under one management, were renamed the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria. Situated on Fifth Avenue in what is now Midtown Manhattan, it was surrounded by streets on all sides. The Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria had a frontage of on Fifth Avenue, on 33rd Street, on 34th Street, and on Astor Court, with 13 entrances opening directly from these thoroughfares. Below, extending to a depth beneath the sidewalk, and occupying an additional area of running toward Broadway, were the basements, which contained the engine room, laundries, and kitchens. From the sidewalk to the observatory roof was a height of . It was the largest hotel in the world at the time. The cost of the two buildings, exclusive of the furnishings but including the land, was about $15 million ($422 million in 2017). The assessed value in 1897 was $12.125 million ($341 million in 2017) making it the next most valuable parcel on Fifth Avenue, after the B. Altman and Company Building site. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, \\"a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family\\". The hotel faced stiff competition from the early 20th century, with a range of new hotels springing up in New York City such the Hotel Astor (1904), perceived as a successor to the Waldorf- Astoria; The St. Regis (1904), built by John Jacob Astor IV as a companion to the Waldorf-Astoria; The Knickerbocker (1906), and the Savoy-Plaza Hotel (1927). By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929; it was demolished soon afterwards. The Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Hotel records of 1893‚Äì1929 are held by the New York Public Library's Archives & Manuscripts division. Society From its inception, the Waldorf was always a \\"must stay\\" hotel for foreign dignitaries. The viceroy of China, Li Hung-Chang stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on 100-year-old eggs which he brought with him. Mr. Li also brought his own stoves, chefs and servants with him to prepare and serve his meals. Upon his departure from the Waldorf, he ordered a basket of roses to be sent to every female guest at the hotel, and was very generous in the gifts and gratuities he provided for the hotel's staff. In 1902, a lavish dinner was organized for Prince Henry of Prussia; in addition, the hotel built a private door on its 33rd Street side and installed a private elevator. The staff was also called upon to form a \\"bucket brigade\\" for the prince's bath when there was a problem with the plumbing in the royal suite. One early wealthy resident was Chicago businessman J. W. Gates who would gamble on stocks on Wall Street and play poker at the hotel. He paid up to $50,000 a year to hire suites at the hotel, where he had his own private entrance and elevator. Grand Duchess Viktoria Feodorovna of Russia was invited by Waldorf president Lucius Bloomer to stay at the hotel in the 1920s. The Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria gained significant renown for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as Andrew Carnegie who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. On February 11, 1899, Oscar of the Waldorf hosted a lavish dinner reception which the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some $250 ($7,620.00 in 2017) was spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green turtle soup, lobster, ruddy duck and blue raspberries. Two months later, 120 sailors of the cruiser Raleigh were given a banquet, during which the gallery was decorated with silk banners and flags. One article that year claimed that at any one time the hotel had $7 million ($213 million in 2017) worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests. In 1909, banquets, attended by hundreds, were organized for Arctic explorer Frederick Cook in September and Elbert Henry Gary, a founder of US Steel, the following month. The hotel was also influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. Boldt's wife, Louise, was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events, or just to be seen in the Peacock Alley. The combined hotel was the first to do away with a ladies-only parlor and provided women with a place to play billiards and ping- pong. It was the first New York hotel to allocate an entire room for afternoon tea. The teas began in the Waldorf Garden with attendance eventually being so large, both the Empire Room and at times, the Rose Room, had to be opened during the hours of four and six pm to accommodate the number of guests. Men were admitted to the teas only if they were in the company of a woman. The United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic was opened at the hotel on April 19, 1912 and continued there for some time in the Myrtle Room, before moving on to Washington, D.C. John Jacob Astor IV was one of the people who perished on its ill-fated journey. The Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Orchestra included several conductors over the years. In the early 1900's, it was under the direction of Carlo Curti, who spent his career between the United States and Mexico. Later he was replaced by Joseph Knecht, who was formerly assistant concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera House. Consisting of fifty musicians, it was maintained by Boldt at an annual expense of $100,000. The orchestra performed regular Sunday night concerts in the grand ballroom. The Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Bar was a favorite haunt of many of the financial elite of the city from the hotel's inception in 1893, and colorful characters who adopted the venue such as Diamond Jim Brady, Buffalo Bill Cody and Bat Masterson. A number of cocktails were invented at the bar, including the Rob Roy (1894) and the Bobbie Burns. Architecture On the exterior, the two and three lower stories in the respective buildings were of red sandstone, while the balance of the work to the roof-line was red brick and red terracotta. The building rested on solid rock and contained a fireproof steel frame. The first and second floors contained public spaces. The combined hotel, after merging in 1897, had 1,300 bedrooms and 178 bathrooms, making it the largest hotel in the world at the time. With a telephone in every room and first-class room service, the hotel featured numerous Turkish and Russian baths for the gentlemen of the day to relax in. Many of the floors were arranged as separate hotels to further the comfort of the guests. Each of these floors had its own team of assistants‚Äîclerks, maids, page boys, waiters‚Äîas well as telephone and dumbwaiter service, and refrigerators. The bedrooms and corridors were heated by direct radiation. The family included a stained glass picture of Walldorf in the design of the hotel; it was located on the 33rd Street side over the main entrance to the South Palm Garden. Waldorf Hotel The Waldorf Hotel, built at a reported cost of about $5 million ($141 million in 2017), opened on March 13, 1893 at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had previously built his mansion. The hotel stood high, about lower than the Astoria, with a frontage of about on Fifth Avenue, and a total area of . It was a German Renaissance structure, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, with 15 public rooms and 450 guest rooms, and a further 100 rooms allocated to servants, with laundry facilities on the upper floors. The New York Times proclaimed the hotel a palace after it opened in 1893. The exterior featured loggias, balconies, gables, groups of chimneys, and tiled roofs. One of the chief features was the interior garden court, with fountains and flowers, walls of white terracotta, frescoes and stained glass. The main entrance to the hotel was \\"sheltered by an elaborate frosted-glass-and-wrought-iron marquee\\", and the entrance hall was built in Sienna marble, with a mosaic title floor and a coffered ceiling. The original reception desk of the Waldorf Hotel became a registration desk when it merged with the Astoria Hotel in 1897. Beyond the lobby was the main corridor leading to the Empire Room, with an alcove containing elevators and a grand staircase. Near this was the Marie Antoinette parlor, which was used as a reception room for women. It contained 18th century antiques brought back by Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe, including a bust of Marie Antoinette, and an antique clock which was once owned by the queen. The ceiling featured frescoes by Will Hicok Low, the central of which was called The Birth of Venus. The Gentleman's Cafe was furnished with \\"robust black oak paneling, hunting murals, and stag-horn chandaliers\\". The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling Delmonico's and Sherry's. It was modelled after the grand salon in King Ludwig's palace at Munich, with satin hangings, upholstery and marble pillars, all of pale green, and Crowninshield's frescoes. Empire in style, the Waldorf's restaurant featured feathered columns of dark-green marble, and the pilasters that were opposite were of mahogany, with ormolu work in the panels. The caps and bases of both columns and pilasters were gilded. This treatment occupied most of the wall space. The ceiling was divided by heavy beams running from column to column, and between these the flat space was divided into oval and other shaped panels with light mouldings. The color scheme was in tints of pale- green and cream. The panels of the ceiling were frescoed with figures in pinkish-red on a blue sky or field. The walls were principally mahogany and gold, with a little color in the comparatively small wall-spaces left between openings. Among the other rooms were the Turkish smoking room, with low divans and ancient Moorish armor, and the ballroom, in white and gold, with Louis XIV decorations. The Waldorf State Apartments, consisting of nine suites, were located on the second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, featured 16th and 17th century French and Italian antiques which Boldt and his wife had brought back from Europe. Francois V Bedroom was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau, and over the years was occupied by the likes of Li Hung-Chang of China, Chowfa Maha Rajiravuth, Prince of Siam, and Albert of Saxe-Coburg. The apartments had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres plates with European portraits. There were about 6,000 lights in the hotel, with as many as 1,000 small candelabra lamps mounted in specially designed fixtures. The electric fixtures were all furnished by the Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company, of New York, while the contract for the general installation work was carried out by the Edison Electric Illuminating Company, of New York, the actual work of wiring being done by the Eastern District of the General Electric Company. The building was wired throughout on the system of the Interior Conduit and Insulation Company. Astoria Hotel The Astoria Hotel, opened in 1897, was situated on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. Like the Waldorf, it was designed in the German Renaissance style by Henry J. Hardenbergh, the same architect who designed the Waldorf. With dimensions of , its height, from the floor of the sub-basement, which was below the street level, to the roof-line, was about , or about above the street-level. It was 16 stories in height, including the four stories in the roof. The building was constructed of stone, marble and brick, with a steel skeleton frame and modern fireproof interior construction, and was embellished with \\"French Second Empire Mansard-roofed towers with iron-work cresting as well as Austrian Baroque onion-domes over corners turrets\\". There were 25 public rooms and 550 guest rooms, with miles of corridors, vestibules and balls. The entrance featured a double set of plate glass doors to give protection in cold weather, and a U-shaped driveway for horse and carriages. The main corridor was nicknamed \\"Peacock Alley\\" by the New York press. The corridor and foyer were treated with pilasters and columns of Sienna marble and a color scheme on the walls and ceilings of salmon-pink, with cream-color and pale-green. The capitals of the columns and pilasters were gilded of solid brass or lacquered. The main corridor ran the entire length of the building from east to west. To the left of it was the Astor Dining Room, fronting on Fifth Avenue, which measured . Great care was taken with it to faithfully reproduce the original dining room of the mansion, three floors above where the original dining room had stood, including all of the original dining room's paneling, carpeting, drapery and fireplace mantel; Italian Renaissance pilasters and columns, carved of marble from northern Russia. The panels of silk hangings were of rose pompadour, and a series of Charles Yardley Turner mural paintings filled arches and panels at the south end of the room. On the right of the main corridor was the Garden Court of Palms, , rising three stories to a dome-like roof of amber glass above the floor. This, too, was used as a dining room. It was decorated in the Italian style, finished in gray, terracotta and Pavonazzo marble. On the 34th Street side of the corridor was the cafe, , finished in English oak in the style of the German Renaissance, with Flemish decoration. The bar formed another room . On the first floor, at the head-of the east main staircase, was the Astor Gallery, , looking out on 34th Street. The gallery, with seven French windows reaching from floor to ceiling, opened onto a terrace over the entrance to the hotel. The interior was finished in the style of the H√¥tel de Soubise, with a blue, gray and gold color scheme. There was a parquet floor, and on the south side, opposite the street windows, were other windows which opened into the main corridor on the second floor. The musicians' balcony, upheld by two caryatids, was at the east end. All the balcony railings were of gilded metal work. The mural paintings were notable: four panels, two at either end of the room, and twelve pendentive panels, six on either side and painted by Edward Simmons depicted the four seasons and the twelve months of the year. The \\"Colonial Room\\" was decorated in red, contrasting with white woodwork. The second floor contained a private suite of apartments at the northeast corner, with large drawing rooms, dining room, butler's pantry, hallway, three bedrooms, three maids' bedrooms and five bathrooms, all finished in old English oak. All the floors above the third were given up to suites and bedrooms up to the 14th floor. There was a bath for nearly every room, and every bathroom had windows opening to the air, not into shafts. In every room, there was a large trunk closet. The ballroom, in the Louis XIV style, has been described as the \\"pi√®ce de r√©sistance\\" of the hotel, measuring by and (three stories) in height. It had a capacity to seat 700 at banquets and 1,200 at concerts, and featured tints of ivory-gray and cream in its design. Noted vocalists such as Enrico Caruso and Nellie Melba performed in the ballroom, with conductor Anton Seidl leading a series of concerts there in the year the combined hotels opened for business. It was possible to buy season tickets for the musical offerings; a box for a season was US$350 and a seat for a season on the ballroom floor was priced at US$60. On the hotel's top floor was the roof-garden, enclosed on all sides by glass, with a glass roof over. It was furnished with rattan chairs and lounges in pale-green and pink, hung across with gauzy fabric. On the roof on the 34th Street side was the grand promenade, , on solid footing high in the air, with a band stand, fountains, and trellises of columns. The roof garden restaurant occupied a space , and was roofed in. The ceiling was high. At the northeast and northwest corners of the roof garden were towers, with spiral stairways within, leading up to the copper covered roofs of the pavilions, which were above the sidewalk. The palm gardens, used as cafes, rose to a height of two and three stories respectively and were roofed-over with domes of tinted glass. Balconies at the various floor levels opened on to these courts to overlook them. The materials used were cream-colored brick and terracotta, and were Italian Renaissance in style. In the sub-basement were the Sprague screw machines for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, and the six Babcock & Wilcox water tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere. Notable people William Waldorf Astor William Waldorf Astor (1848‚Äì1919) was a wealthy American attorney, politician, businessman, and newspaper publisher of the Astor family. He was the only child of financier/philanthropist John Jacob Astor III (1822‚Äì1890) and Charlotte Augusta Gibbes (1825‚Äì1887). Described as being a \\"very prickly sort of person\\", he had a background in Europe and earned wealth buying and selling country estates in England including Cliveden and Hever Castle. In his early adult years, Astor returned to the United States and began studies at Columbia Law School. He was called to the United States Bar in 1875. He worked for a short time in law practice and in the management of his father's estate of financial and real estate holdings. On his death in 1919, he was reputed to have been worth ¬£200 million, which he left in trust for his two sons Waldorf and John Jacob. His half share of the Waldorf Astoria and the Astor Hotel at the time were reported to have been worth ¬£10 million. George Boldt George Boldt (1851‚Äì1916), the founding proprietor, was a Prussian-born American hotelier and self-made millionaire who influenced the development of the urban hotel as a civic social center and luxury destination. His motto was \\"the guest is always right\\", and he became a wealthy and prominent figure internationally. The hotel was built to his specifications. He served as president and director of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel Company, as well as the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Segar Company and the Waldorf Importation Company. He also owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, an elite boutique hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, with his wife, Louise. Boldt was described as \\"Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming\\", resembling \\"a typical German professor with his close-cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his pince-nez glasses on a black silk cord\\". Boldt retained his contacts with the European elite and he and his wife made frequent trips to Europe, bringing back with them many antiques, a characteristic of the Waldorf Astoria. Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed. Lucius M. Boomer Lucius M. Boomer (1878‚Äì1947) was an American hotelier and businessman, responsible for the general management of the hotel for many years. Physically impressive and brassy, he displayed total dedication to his job and great discipline and care towards his staff, becoming one of the most famous hoteliers of his time. Boomer became interested in the hotel after the death of Boldt in 1916 and purchased it, before buying the Bellevue-Stratford two years later. Following the retirement of Louis Sherry in 1920, he became directing head of the Louis Sherry Ice Cream and Chocolate Company, and was later president of restaurant chain Savarin, Inc. Boomer was primarily responsible for the decision to demolish the hotel and build the new one on Park Avenue in 1931. He continued to manage the hotel until his death in Norway in July 1947. Henry Janeway Hardenbergh Henry J. Hardenbergh (1847‚Äì1918) was an American architect who designed both hotels in the German Renaissance style. Apprenticed in New York from 1865 to 1870 under Detlef Lienau, in 1870, opened his own practice there. He obtained his first contracts for three buildings at Rutgers College in New Brunswick, New Jersey‚Äîthe expansion of Alexander Johnston Hall (1871), designing and building Geology Hall (1872) and the Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873)‚Äîthrough family connections. Hardenbergh designed the Dakota Apartments in 1884, and after building the Waldorf he went on to have an illustrious career as \\"America's premiere architect of grand hotels\\", designing the Manhattan Hotel (1896), the Plaza Hotel (1907), the Martinique Hotel (1911) and numerous other hotels in cities such as Boston and Washington, D.C. Louis Sherry Louis Sherry (1855‚Äì1926) was an American restaurateur, caterer, confectioner and hotelier during the Gilded Age and early 20th century, who was of considerable renown in the business. His name is typically associated with an upscale brand of candy and ice cream, and The Sherry-Netherland hotel in New York City. In 1919, Sherry announced an \\"alliance\\" with the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria that involved both his candies and catering services. Although it was not disclosed at that time, at some point ownership of Louis Sherry Inc. was significantly vested in \\"Boomer-duPont interests\\", a reference to Lucius M. Boomer, then chairman of the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria, and T. Coleman du Pont. Oscar Tschirky Oscar Tschirky (1866‚Äì1950), known as \\"Oscar of the Waldorf\\", was a Swiss chef, ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel from the hotel's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland ten years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf and over the years grew to possess an encyclopedic-like knowledge of cuisine and the special trimmings and preferences that the regular diners desired. He authored The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the recipes of the day, including his own, such as Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict and Thousand Island dressing, which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book Peacock Alley that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who \\"composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees\\". In 1902 Tschirky published Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria, a booklet which explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite. Tschirky continued to work for the Waldorf Astoria after the original hotel was demolished until his retirement in 1943.

Location The building stands on the eastern side of Gdanska Street at N¬∞34, between Krasi≈Ñski and S≈Çowackiego streets. History The house was built in 1906 for a master painter, Walther Minge on the site of an earlier building. The address at that time was \\"Danzigerstrasse 151/152\\". In the house standing on the premises lived from 1893 to 1895 Anton Hoffmann, a Bydgoszcz architect, stepfather of the famous local builder J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki. The architect was Fritz Weidner, a German builder who came to Bydgoszcz at the end of the 19th century and had a frantic building activity in the city between 1896 and 1914. He lived in this tenement he built from 1912 onwards. In this building has been located the first movie theater in Bydgoszcz, opened on October 10, 1908, by a 30-year-old Pole, Waclaw Szkaradkiewicz. In the same area, Fritz Weidner built houses at the following addresses: * Mix Ernst tenement and movie theatre at Gdanska Street 10 in 1905; * Thomas Frankowski Tenement at Gdanska Street 28 in 1897; * George Sikorski Tenement at Gda≈Ñska Street 31, in 1906; * Max Rosental Tenement at Gdanska Street 42 in 1905; * Ernst Bartsch tenement at Gda≈Ñska Street79, in 1898; * Tenement at Plac Wolno≈õci (Freedom Square) 3, in 1903. He also took part in the design of: * first reinforced concrete building in Bydgoszcz, designed by Berlin architect Otto Walther at Gda≈Ñska 15; * Department Store Brandt (now Bank PKO SA) at Theatre square N¬∞4. Before WWI, the building housed the seat of Windschild and Langelott, a construction company which re-built in 1912-1913 the Queen Jadwiga bridge, allowing the Kr√≥lowej Jadwigi Street to cross the Brda river. In the 1920s, a photographic workshop was located there, run by Emil Wehram. During interwar period, the address was Ulica Gda≈Ñska 152, a car dealership company \\"Zagorski & Ska\\" was housed there. Architecture The building presents the form of German Historicism, characteristic for projects Fritz Weidner. This style also became popular as \\"Landhaus Stil\\", and quickly appeared in the streets of Bydgoszcz. The first implementation of this architecture was realized in 1906 with the present building.Daria Brƒôczewska- Kulesza Wp≈Çyw architektury i architekt√≥w berli≈Ñskich na bydgoskie budownictwo mieszkaniowe na prze≈Çomie XIX i XX stulecia. The edifice has an asymmetrical fa√ßade, with vertical loggias, bay windows and tall, triangular gables with wattle and daub structure. The architectural style of the building refers to the early modernism, where the stucco decoration is reduced to a minimum, while the most important measure is the artistic arrangement of architectural elements that make up the facade.

The Treaty provisions * Art 101(1): The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market: all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market. * Art 101(3): Any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to this section shall be automatically void. * Art 101(3): This subsection gives a list of derogations (or exceptions).The relevant articles were originally numbered 85 & 86, then 81 & 82, and finally 101 & 102. Facts Grundig GmbH contracted to distribute its electronic goods in France, appointing appointed Consten SaRL as its exclusive distributor. Grundig guaranteed that no other wholesaler would be allowed to distribute in France, and that, for the purposes of the distribution of Grundig products, Consten was given sole authorisation to use the Grundig name and emblems which are registered in Germany and in other Member States A third-party company, UNEF, bought Grundig products in Germany and began distributing \\"grey imports\\" into France, whereupon Consten and Grundig sought to prevent UNEF from doing so, claiming, inter alia, that UNEF was abusing Grundig's copyright in its own trade name and logos. The Commission viewed Consten's and Grundig's action against UNEF as an unlawful breach of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome (now Art 101 of the TFEU), as it was important to ensure that competing parallel imports from one state to another were unhindered. The case was referred for a Preliminary Ruling to the European Court of Justice under Article 177. Judgment Agreeing with the Commission, the ECJ held that the agreement was unlawful. It rejected the argument that allowing exclusive distributorships protected a distributor's legitimate interest, by hypothetically preventing competitors (once the costs for initial market penetration had been spent) from free riding on the investment of advertising and marketing initially by the distributor, and then undercutting prices.

Three seasons were broadcast. Background Following Milomir Mariƒá's interview with Boris Malagurski for the \\"Cyrillic\\" show on Happy TV, Malagurski pitched Mariƒá his idea for a TV show called Revolution of Awareness. Mariƒá suggested to Malagurski that he should shorten the title to just Revolution and that he should film a pilot episode. The owner of Happy TV liked the pilot episode and Revolucija started in 2013.Boris Malagurski otkriva kako i za≈°to je zabranjena emisija ‚ÄúRevolucija‚Äù Teleprompter Conception The show, in which the host, Boris Malagurski, interviewed state officials, foreign and local experts in a television studio, also featured documentary segments in which Malagurski talked with ordinary citizens in Serbia and dealt with problems in Serbian society.The Revolution of Boris Malagurski on Happy TV Story.rs According to the author, the purpose of the show was not to just talk about problems in Serbian society, but to take action to change them. He noted that the \\"show itself will only initiate the actions, but then it's up to the citizens to move things forward\\". At the end of every show, Malagurski called citizens to contact him and notify his team about the problems they're facing so that they may try to deal with them together. The author stressed that the goal was not for him to fix other people's problems, but to give them ideas and present ways in which they can solve issues themselves.Revolucija Borisa Malagurskog GradSubotica.co.rs Notable episodes The Presumption of Justice broadcast In April 2013, The Presumption of Justice, a documentary film directed by Boris Malagurski and Ivana Rajoviƒá, dealing with the 2009 death of a French football fan and alleged inconsistencies in the subsequent court case in Serbia. After the premiere, Malagurski discussed the film with guests in the studio, who included co-director Ivana Rajoviƒá, lawyers Branislav Tapu≈°koviƒá and Zora Dobriƒçanin, and Dragan Crepulja, an alleged witness who had not been called to testify at subsequent court case. In the interview, Crepulja claimed that he \\"saw it when the now deceased Taton fell, there was nobody next to him, not on the stairs, not by his side... I was two meters close to Taton when he fell, I immediately looked around, up and down, there was no one there, I can confirm that. I told this to the police officers who came.\\"Drugaƒçija istina o stradanju Brisa Tatona PressOnline.rs The film also sparked a threats controversy. \\"Anemija\\" situation In April 2014, Malagurski attempted to interview Radovanka Predragoviƒá Stevaniƒá, the Director of the Institute for Specialized Rehabilitation \\"Ivanjica\\", (known as \\"Anemija\\") regarding complaints against her by colleagues and former employees at \\"Anemija\\". When Malagurski knocked on the door of her office, she refused to open it and the police showed up to escort Malagurski and his TV crew off the premises. Following the broadcast, the Vice President of the Board of Director of \\"Anemija\\", Milo≈° Joviƒáeviƒá, resigned, noting that the fact that the Director and her Legal Adviser called the police on the TV crew was \\"scandalous\\". The Director, Radovanka Predragoviƒá Stevaniƒá, announced a lawsuit against Happy TV because its TV crew was allegedly \\"trying to enter forcibly\\", which Malagurski denied, saying \\"the footage clearly shows that we were calmly standing and knocking on the door of a public institution as representatives of a media outlet.\\"–†–µ–≤–æ–ª—É—Ü–∏—ò–∞ —É ‚Äû–ê–Ω–µ–º–∏—ò–∏‚Äú, –Ω–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∞—Ä–∏ –∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–Ω–∏ —É–∑ –ø–æ–º–æ—õ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ü–∏—ò–µ –ì–ª–∞—Å –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–µ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–µ Prokupac break-in In June 2014, Malagurski and his TV crew went to the Prokupac factory in the Vo≈ædovac municipality of Belgrade to support the workers who had been laid off and protesting in front of the factory. Malagurski asked the security officer to open the gate, which he refused, so Malagurski jumped over the gate, while the workers forcefully opened it and streamed into the factory grounds, together with the TV crew. The police quickly showed up, as well as the bankruptcy trustee, who refused to talk in front of cameras, and after several tense moments, the situation deescalated and the workers got a chance to talk to the bankruptcy trustee.Na ƒçijoj strani je dr≈æava? Danas newspaper Workers' rights at Yura In July 2014, Malagurski interviewed two workers at the South Korean-owned Yura Corporation operating in the Serbian city of Ni≈°, Nemanja Vasiljeviƒá and Marijan Jeftoviƒá, about alleged workers' rights infringements at the company. Vasiljeviƒá told Malagurski that he has seen \\"women on the production line fainting\\" and that \\"workers have to sign out whenever they want to go to the toilet\\". They both complained that Yura wasn't allowing them to form a union, which is a constitutional right of every worker in Serbia. Malagurski then proceeded to approach the Yura Corporation Ni≈° headquarters gate with a copy of the Constitution of Serbia, translated to Korean, in an attempt to give the Constitution to the owners of the company. Though Malagurski was able to pass through the gate and enter the building, security asked Malagurski to exit the premises and members of Serbia's gendarmery didn't allow Malagurski to enter again. Nobody from the company was willing to take the copy of the constitution.Dictatorship at Yura Teleprompter.rs Controversies Kostiƒá allegations In January 2013, Malagurski interviewed Vesna Kostiƒá of the World Bank office in Belgrade for his show Revolution on Serbia's Happy TV. After the interview was broadcast, Kostiƒá wrote a letter of complaint to the Association of Journalists of Serbia, claiming that Malagurski had \\"forged\\" a conversation. According to Kostiƒá, Malagurski \\"pasted\\" the answer to one question, into the response to a different question, which Kostiƒá said was a violation of the code of journalistic ethics. Malagurski reacted by claiming on his Facebook page, that he \\"didn't forge anything\\", but that Ms. Kostic either \\"forgot how she answered the questions\\" or had \\"bad intentions\\". On his Facebook page, he offered to show Vesna Kostiƒá the unedited interview. Censorship allegations In December 2013, an episode of Revolution was, according to the author, not allowed to air on Happy TV. \\"I was told by Happy TV representatives that the Chief of Staff of Mlaƒëan Dinkiƒá called the TV station and was very angry,\\" said Malagurski and added \\"Happy TV asked me to edit out parts of the show, which I refused.\\"Dinkic's Chief of Staff censored Revolution The episode in question concerned money moved from Serbia to Cyprus in the 1990s, how Mobtel was privatized and why bank interest rates were so high in Serbia. Croatian journalist Domagoj Matgetiƒá and Branko Draga≈° were due to be guests in the programme. Cancellation In January 2015, the show was cancelled, Malagurski claims to have received no official reason for the cancellation, when asked by reporters about the issue, he replied \\"maybe you should ask Happy TV\\".

The Foundation supports programs at several institutions to encourage research, particularly the work of young researchers who might not be eligible for other sources of funding. People from a variety of different programs at different institutions may therefore be referred to as Beckman Fellows. Though most often designating postdoctoral awards in science, the exact significance of the term will vary depending on the institution involved and the type(s) of Beckman Fellowship awarded at that institution.  Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation   Arnold O. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellowships  The Arnold O. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellowship program was sponsored by the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation to support research at US institutions in the biological and chemical sciences. A total of sixty Fellowships were awarded from 2015 ‚Äì 2017. After an evaluation in 2018, the Foundation then relaunched the program for 2019 as the Arnold O. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemical Sciences or Chemical Instrumentation. The purpose of the program is to support advanced research by postdoctoral scholars in fundamental chemistry research or the development of chemical instrumentation.  University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign   Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology  The Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign offers a variety of fellowship programs. Beckman Graduate Fellowships Beckman Graduate Fellowships are awarded to students at the University of Illinois who are working at the master's or doctorate level. Students propose interdisciplinary research projects involving at least two University of Illinois faculty members, at least one of whom is associated with the Beckman Institute. The award provides funding at the level of a 50% Graduate Research Assistantship for eleven months. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellows Beckman Postdoctoral Fellowships are awarded to recent Ph.D.'s who receive 3-year appointments at the Beckman Institute, including both a stipend and a research budget. They must be doing interdisciplinary research in an area of research relevant to the Beckman Institute. The first Beckman postdoctoral fellows were Efrat Shimshoni (condensed matter physics) and Andrew Nobel (information theory and statistics) in 1992. Since the founding of the original Beckman Institute Postdoctoral Fellows Program, two similar programs have been initiated: the Carle Foundation Hospital-Beckman Institute Postdoctoral Fellows Program (begun in 2008 and jointly funded by the Carle Foundation Hospital of Urbana, Illinois) and the Beckman-Brown Interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Fellowship (begun in 2015 by an endowment from the Arnold O. and Mabel M. Beckman Foundation made in honor of Theodore L. Brown, founding director of the Beckman Institute). The following researchers are or have been Beckman Postdoctoral Fellows. The institution listed is the one from which the person had received a Ph.D. Fellowships were awarded as of the year listed. Beckman Senior Fellows Beckman Senior Fellowships are awarded to senior faculty from other institutions, who come to the University of Illinois to collaborate with researchers there, usually for a short period of three to six months. Beckman Senior Fellows include: * Nelson Cowan (University of Missouri, 2017) * Frini Karayanidis (University of Newcastle, Australia, 2016) * Christophe Chipot (CNRS, France, 2015) * Daniel A. King (Eastern Mennonite University, 2014) * Kirk Erickson (University of Pittsburgh, 2013‚Äì2014) * Lisa Frank (University of Wisconsin at Madison, 2012‚Äì2013) * Jong Chul Ye (KAIST, 2012‚Äì2013) * Nadja Schott (Justus-Liebig- University in Giessen, Germany, 2007) * Dimitris C.

The CAS awards a series of Beckman Fellowships and Beckman Research Awards which support faculty at Urbana-Champaign in their research activities. These awards were funded through an endowment from Arnold and Mabel Beckman, given in the late 1970s, prior to the establishment of the Beckman Institute. They are administered separately and are awarded in departments throughout the university, not just within the sciences. The Center for Advanced Study (CAS) has awarded Beckman Fellowships to the following University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign faculty members, with their home department and Fellowship award year shown.  Stanford University  Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine  The Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine in the Stanford School of Medicine was funded in part by $12 million from the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation, approximately one-fifth of the costs for the new center. It opened in May 1989. The Beckman Fellows program was established in 1999 to support young researchers. Recipients include: * Susanna Mlynarczyk- Evans (2008‚Äì2011) * Sheila Jaswal (2003‚Äì2006) * Zach Serber (2003‚Äì2006) * Frederic Charron (2002‚Äì2005) * Kevin Travers (2002‚Äì2005) * Michael Galko (2001‚Äì2004)  California Institute of Technology (Caltech)   Beckman Institute at Caltech  In 2000, the Beckman Institute at Caltech in Pasadena received a grant from the Beckman Foundation to support Beckman Postgraduate Fellowships for five years.

The River's Edge Arts Alliance is a local, non-profit 501(c)(3) charitable organization which has been dedicated to promoting community arts, arts education and cultural enrichment for the past two decades. The organization provides arts activities that appeal to a broad range of interests, age groups and backgrounds, the River's Edge Arts Alliance has positively impacted the region's cultural development by offering a wide spectrum of visual and performing art, while bringing people together to enjoy a variety of dynamic arts activities. The River's Edge Arts Alliance presents musical performances, theater performances, art exhibits as well as offering education classes for children and adults in art, music and theater. It promotes the growth of the arts in cities and towns in MetroWest Boston as well as Central Massachusetts.  Location  The River's Edge Arts Alliance Office is located in the Hudson Public Schools Administration Building at 155 Apsley Street in Hudson, Massachusetts.  History  The concept of the River's Arts Alliance was developed in 1988 when local parents and teachers created an informal organization to increase cultural activities for school children and their families. The Community Arts Series was created in 1988, followed by the Drama Workshop summer program in 1989. The River's Edge Arts Alliance was formed the following year to manage the Arts Series and Drama Workshop. Visual art exhibits as well as a newsletter and arts calendar were developed. Jan Patterson, a founding member of the River's Edge Arts Alliance, was hired as full-time executive director in 1993 through a grant from the Massachusetts Cultural Council. After school classes, area arts meetings and other programs were added, and the River's Edge Arts Alliance became increasingly known at the regional level. A program director was hired in 1998 with additional staff added in subsequent years. The After School Band Lesson Program was developed in 1997 and the Focus on Kids! Series in Marlborough in 1999. The following year the agency took over management of the Pro Musica Youth Chorus, now called the River's Edge Youth Chorus, and in 2002 the River's Edge Community Band was formed. Art in the Hall, a series of individual artist exhibits at Hudson Town Hall, was developed in December 2003. The River's Edge Chorale was formed in 2005, followed by the River's Edge Players in 2006. The River's Edge Arts Alliance fosters appreciation of the arts through education, performance, exhibition, promotion, and by serving as a resource for arts education, cultural groups, and artists in the area. It serves children, parents, elders, artists, arts organizations, schools, and the population at large as it seeks to inspire deeper interest in all aspects of the arts, foster understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity, and integrate the arts more fully into individual and community life. The organization effectively brings artists into the community while developing the artistic potential of those who live here. Managed by a small staff, an active board of directors and many other enthusiastic volunteers, the Arts Alliance currently has 150 donors/sponsors and about 350 members from 35 area communities who are individuals, families, artists, organizations and businesses. There are many other ways that individuals, businesses, organizations, municipalities and foundations support the River's Edge Arts Alliance. Making the arts flourish locally, this support demonstrates the value placed on the creative arts for the many ways they inspire and enrich our communities. The River's Edge Arts Alliance offers a broad array of arts activities in which thousands of adults and children participate, often as families. The River's Edge Arts Alliance is responsible for creating and sustaining many cultural activities and organizations including: Art in the Hall, Arts After School, Arts in the Park, Community Arts Series, Focus on the Arts, Hudson Band Lesson Program, Hudson Pathways, River's Edge Youth Chorus, River's Edge Chorale, River's Edge Community Band, River's Edge Players, Saturday Morning Discovery Series, Summer Arts, Summer Drama Workshop (now in its 25th year) and many visual arts exhibits. These quality, yet affordable, events, exhibits and classes are held in Hudson and surrounding towns. In addition to its regular programming in performing arts, visual arts and arts education, the agency has participated in many collaborative and partnership initiatives. Marlborough residents have participated in Arts Alliance programs since the beginning, and during the past thirteen years, the Arts Alliance has offered an increasing number of programs in the City. Many community-minded people value creativity and the way it inspires our lives and improves the area's quality of life. Thanks to the support of area individuals, organizations, businesses, municipalities and foundations that value the arts which so enrich our lives, many community members participate in these free or moderately-priced programs. The organization believes in integrating the arts into everyday community life, as well as helping arts education thrive. It creates and sustains participant and performance opportunities. The Arts Alliance collaborates with schools, arts organizations, businesses and artists, all the while bringing diverse people together. The most critical factor in sustaining area arts programming is the active involvement of the community, people interested in making a difference in their community through the arts. The Commonwealth Award is the state's highest honor in the arts, humanities and interpretive sciences. These awards are presented every two years by the Massachusetts Cultural Council to honor individuals and organizations that have made extraordinary contributions to the quality of life, education, and economy in Massachusetts through arts and culture. This prestigious honor was awarded to the River's Edge Arts Alliance at the State House in 1997. In 1995 Aerosmith received the Catalyst award, an earlier version of the MCC's Creative Economy Award. Other winners have included Doris Kearns Goodwin, David McCullough, Henry Hampton, Bradford Washburn, Dr. Stephen Jay Gould, DeCordova Museum & Sculpture Park, Wheelock Family Theater, Greater Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras, North Bennet Street School, Massachusetts College of Art, Stanley Kunitz (10th US Poet Laureate,) Richard Yarde, Yo Yo Ma, Robert Brustein (American Repertory Theatre), Edmund Barry Gaither, Gunther Schuller, City of Pittsfield, Worcester Cultural Coalition and Peabody Essex Museum. Each year the River's Edge Arts Alliance sponsors dozens of exciting, enriching and entertaining events, exhibits and educational workshops in Marlborough and Hudson, providing the public with numerous opportunities to experience quality arts programs that boost the cultural ambiance of the area. It brought over thirteen years of bringing to Marlborough the quality cultural programming the Focus on the Arts Series (formerly named Focus on Kids) and Children's Theater Workshop performances. For ten years, the popular Family Fun Festivals (formerly called The Saturday Morning Discovery Series), a program managed by the River's Edge Arts Alliance for the City of Marlborough, has offered some of the region's top performers presenting free performances on Union Common in the summer and at the Walker Building or Marlborough Senior Center in the winter. The River's Arts Alliance's 20th anniversary was celebrated on January 16, 2010 with the \\"Taste of the Arts\\" Gala at the Hudson Public Library. The Hudson Selectmen's proclamation was read by Sonny Parente, and Senator Jamie Eldridge and Representative Kate Hogan offered recognition from the State House. Also on hand were a variety of musicians and visual artists who shared their work with the attendees as well as board members, staff and many community leaders and arts supporters.

Facts Bayer AG, the parent of one of the largest European chemical and pharmaceutical groups, manufactured Adalat, used to treat cardio- vascular disease. It was sold by wholly owned subsidiaries in different member states. National health authorities fix prices for medicines, and the Spanish and French prices were fixed at a rate 40 per cent lower than UK prices. Wholesalers were buying Adalat in Spain and France and importing it to the UK, meaning that Bayer UK was at a loss. Bayer changed its delivery policy, so that it did not fulfil all large orders placed by Spain and France. The Commission found that Bayer France and Bayer Spain had made an agreement with wholesalers, which amounted to an unlawful export ban. Bayer argued that it was restricting sales from Spain and France to the UK, but it denied that the policy was implemented through any agreement. Judgment The ECJ held that Bayer had not acted unlawfully, because it had simply made a unilateral decision. To say that this was the same as an agreement would be to confuse (what is now) TFEU article 101 on collusion, with article 102 on abuse of monopoly power.

It is classified as a Shaiva Upanishad, and survives into the modern times in two versions, one attached to the Krishna Yajurveda and other attached to the Atharvaveda. It is, as an Upanishad, a part of the corpus of Vedanta literature collection that present the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Upanishad extols Shiva, aloneness and renunciation, describes the inner state of man in his personal spiritual journey detached from the world. The text is notable for presenting Shaivism in Vedanta, discussing Atman (Soul, Self) and its relation to Brahman, and Self-knowledge as the path to kaivalya (liberation). The text, states Paul Deussen ‚Äì a German Indologist and professor of Philosophy, is particularly beautiful in the way it describes the self-realized man who \\"feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all\\", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with God (Shiva, highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, in the depths of his heart. Etymology The Sanskrit word Kaivalya means \\"aloneness, isolation\\", and refers to someone who has renounced and isolated himself from all attachments to worldly desires. It also refers to \\"the absoluteness\\", states Deussen, the inner conviction of man on a spiritual journey to liberation. The term Upanishad means it is knowledge or \\"hidden doctrine\\" text that belongs to the corpus of Vedanta literature collection presenting the philosophical concepts of Hinduism and considered the highest purpose of its scripture, the Vedas.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 1, Oxford University Press, page LXXXVI footnote 1, 22, verse 13.4 Chronology and anthology The Kaivalya Upanishad, remarks Deussen, is from the group of five Upanishads which extol and assert god Shiva as a symbolism for Atman (soul). These five Upanishads ‚Äì Atharvashiras, Atharvashikha, Nilarudra, Kalagnirudra and Kaivalya ‚Äì are ancient, with Nilarudra likely the oldest and Kaivalya the relatively later era 1st millennium BCE Upanishad, composed closer to Shvetashvatara Upanishad, Mundaka Upanishad, and Mahanarayana Upanishad. The manuscripts of this minor Upanishad is sometimes attached to the Krishna Yajurveda, or alternatively attached to the Atharvaveda. In the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, this ShaivaAM Sastri, The ≈öaiva-Upanishads with the commentary of Sri Upanishad-Brahma- Yogin, Adyar Library, Upanishad is listed 12th in the anthology of 108 Upanishads. The text is also titled as the Kaivalyopanishad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 349-352 Structure The Kaivalya Upanishad manuscripts vary, depending on which Veda it is attached to. The one attached to Krishna Yajurveda has 26 verses, while the edition attached to the Atharvaveda has 24 verses with an epilogue. Both convey the same message, but the former is structured as a single chapter, and the latter into two chapters (19 verses in first, 5 verses in second). The text is structured as verses, set to a poetic Vedic meter (exactly same number of syllables per verse of the song). The Upanishad is presented as a discourse between the Vedic sage Ashvalayana and the god Brahma, wherein the Ashvalayana asks Brahma for Brahma-vidya, that is the knowledge of ultimate reality Brahman. The Upanishad's structure is notable as it embeds key parts of verses from early Principal Upanishads, thus referencing them and yet building its own message. The fragments of earlier major Upanishads it thus integrates within it, include Mundaka Upanishad and Shvetashvatara Upanishad. The text is also notable for presenting Shaivism with Vedanta terminology, discussing the relationship of Atman (Soul, Self) and Brahman (ultimate Reality), and Self- knowledge as the means to Kaivalya (liberation). The text describes the self- realized man as one who \\"feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all\\", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with Shiva (the highest soul), who has found this highest soul within, in the depths of his heart.Chester G Starr (1991), A History of the Ancient World, 4th Edition, Oxford University Press, , page 168 Content The setting: Ashvalayana and Brahma (verses 1-2) The Upanishad opens with sage Ashvalayana meeting Brahma, the creator god in Hindu trimurti. Ashvalayana is a revered Vedic sage, mentioned in the Rigveda, student of the ancient grammarian Shaunaka, and belonging to the Hindu tradition of forest hermits who wander.Ashvalayana (Vedic teacher), Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2015) Ashvalayana, states the text, asks Paramesthi (synonym for Brahma) for Brahmavidya, which Ashvalyana calls \\"the highest knowledge, always cultivated by the good\\", one that enables to reach the person who is greater than the great. This verse references a fragment from section 3.2 of the Mundaka Upanishad. Brahma answers, asserts verse 2 of the Upanishad, \\"Seek knowledge with Sraddha-bhakti-dhyana-yogadavehi (faith, devotion, meditation in yoga), not ritual works, not wealth, not offsprings\\". Aloneness and renunciation, states the text, is the path to the life of eternity. Brahma's answer: Grasp Vedanta doctrine (verses 3-5) Beyond heaven, in the heart, that which shines within, states Brahma in verse 3 of the Upanishad, is the destination of those who have understood the meaning of Vedanta doctrine. There, states the text, all the sannyasis (renunciates) who have reached that wisdom reside, in the state of pure being. The Upanishad says, seclusion is their place, enthroned is their joy, calm is their Yoga. These are the ones, asserts the Upanishad, who revere their teachers (Guru), who live a life of virtuous self- restraint, in their Ashrama (stage) of life. These are the ones who meditate, states the text, their focus on their heart, wherein resides the pure one, the griefless, the bliss. The verse 4 references a fragment each from section 3.2 of Mundaka Upanishad, and section 2.8 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad. Meditate on Shiva: He, Brahman, Indra, Vishnu are same (verses 6-9) The text then iconographically paints god Shiva, as the one who is the companion of Uma, with three eyes, blue neck, the calm wonderful lord imbued with intelligence and bliss, the source of everything. It is this supreme lord, states the text, one must meditate on, asserts verse 7. This supreme, states Kaivalya Upanishad, is the eternal, the all-pervading, formless, unmanifest, infinite, inconceivable, one without beginning or middle or end, one which is chidananda (\\"consciousness-bliss\\"). He is, states the Upanishad, Brahman, Shiva, Indra, Vishnu, Prana (life force, breath), fire and moon (time, lunar calendar). Eternity is him, states the text, all that originated is him, all that originates is him. Know him, find liberation, there is no other way, states verse 9. Meditate on Om: the three states of consciousness (verses 10-15) The Kaivalya Upanishad asserts that one must see \\"his Atman (soul) in all beings, and all beings in his Atman\\" to attain salvation, there is no other way. In verse 11, the text makes a reference to a fragment from section 1.14 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, to metaphorically describe how to gain this knowledge. Making his own soul as the lower fire stick and Om the upper fire stick, states the Kaivalya Upanishad, one must rub these together, light up the fire of knowledge, and burn the ties to ignorance. A Jiva (being) immersed in Maya (changing reality, illusive world) craves for worldly greed, performs karoti (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã‡§§‡§ø, ritual works), enjoys bodily pleasures like women, food, drink and pleasures. This, states the text, gives him satisfaction in his wakeful state, in dream as he sleeps his soul fashions a dream world of joys and nightmares, but this is all deception. True bliss, states the text, comes in the third state of consciousness. It is, states the text, the third state, everything comes to rest, in whole, in peace, in bliss. Shiva, Brahman is within you (verses 16-17) According to Chester Starr, a professor of History, the next two verses of the Upanishad crystallize the ancient Hindu thought. Man has an Atman (spirit) identical with the great spirit of the world, repeated in its great Upanishadic saying, \\"That art thou,\\" or God is within man. The verse 17 of the text repeats, that all three states, experienced when one is awake, when one dreams, when one is in deep dreamless sleep, is illuminated therein. \\"Know yourself to be that Brahman\\", translates Deussen, and experience liberation. The state of liberation (verses 18-24) The text, in verses 18 to 24 describes the state of liberated renouncer. The Upanishad states he is blissful, content in all three states of consciousness, feels everything was born in him and abides in him and dissolves in him, that he is Brahman that is in everyone, he is Sadashiva, ancient, diverse, spiritual, with the gift to know eternity. The liberated renouncer, feels he is the knower, the perceiver, the one to learn the Vedas, the one to perfect the Vedas, states verse 22 of the text. He feels his essence is beyond good and bad, beyond body and mind, beyond merit and demerits, beyond what perishes, asserts the text.Peter Heehs (2002), Indian Religions: A Historical Reader of Spiritual Expression and Experience, New York University Press, , pages 85-86 The liberated man, states the Upanishad, has found the highest Atman in his heart. Epilogue In the end, the glories of reciting the Kaivalya Upanishad are told. Recitation of this Upanishad, asserts the epilogue, frees one of various sins, end the cycle of samsara (birth-death-rebirth), gains Supreme Knowledge and kaivalya. The style of the text's epilogue, that is the concluding verses, is odd and different from the rest of the text. This structural anomaly, as well as the very different message therein, states Deussen, suggests that the passage on the \\"study of Satarudriyam and all sorts of promises\\" may be a later insertion or an accident of extraction from the Vedic text in which this Upanishad was embedded. Commentaries Commentaries on the Kaivalya Upanishad are written by Brahmayogin (c. 1800 CE) and Osho (1931 ‚Äì 1990). An incomplete commentary, which includes only the first verse, by Aurobindo was written in 1912 and first published in 1971. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan translated this text in 1953.

Open year-round, it is in area. Much of the state park was created from land originally preserved by William Poole Bancroft in the early 1900s to be used as open space parkland by the city of Wilmington as it expanded. The park also includes the Blue Ball Barn, a dairy barn built by Alfred I. du Pont as part of his Nemours estate in 1914. In addition to walking trails, athletic fields, and playgrounds for children, one of the park's primary features is a rock climbing wall. The rock climbing wall is part of an old quarry across from historic Bancroft Mills on the Brandywine, and the quarry is also used for school educational programs centered on earth sciences. Park history Footbridge to Bancroft Mills Brandywine River and Alapocas Woods Alapocas Run was originally created as a 123 acre city park named Alapocas Woods. In 1910 when Alfred I. du Pont was building his Nemours estate from DuPont Company lands, fellow industrialist William Poole Bancroft convinced him to have the company transfer a portion of the land between Nemours and the Brandywine to the city of Wilmington. Bancroft then donated a portion of his own lands along the Brandywine to the city. In addition to being a businessman, Bancroft was also a philanthropist and conservationist and had played a key role, including donating land, in establishing other city parks due to his desire to preserve the scenic beauty of the Brandywine. Directly across the river was the mill complex owned by him and his brother, Samuel. At the time of the creation of Alapocas Woods, he was serving as President of the Wilmington Park Commission. Bancroft and du Pont then jointly paid for the paving of Alapocas Road, which separated the park from the Nemours estate. The park grew to 145 acres over the years, much of which consisted of mature woodland. It also contained the remains of an granite quarry which had operated from 1870 to 1938. Stone from the quarry had been used to create local landmarks such as the Brandywine Park walls, Rockford Park's tower, and the National Harbor of Refuge. In 1998, Alapocas Run was made part of a state park when it was combined with several other city parks to form Wilmington State Parks. Trail through Alapocas Woods In 1999, as part of its efforts to convince pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to relocate its headquarters to the Wilmington suburbs, the state launched the $127 million Blue Ball Project to redo the area's network of roads in addition to creating additional parkland by purchasing open space, developing recreational facilities, and preserving local historic structures. The project included the purchase of roughly 152 acres of land from the nearby Nemours Foundation to be used as open space parkland. At the time of the purchase, the Nemours Foundation also donated a conservation easement on 70 acres of mature woods behind the Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children. The new Alapocas Run State Park was officially dedicated in 2002, with the existing parkland near the Brandywine combined with the additional open space purchased as part of the Blue Ball Project. Development of various park amenities, including the restoration of the historic Blue Ball Barn, was slated to take place over the next three years. In November 2015, it was announced that the Nemours Foundation donated 46 acres (of the 70 under conservation easement) for an expansion of the park. Blue Ball Barn Blue Ball Dairy Barn The Blue Ball Barn serves as the park visitor's center and headquarters. The Delaware Folk Art Collection is on permanent exhibit within the barn, and it houses over 120 works by 50 local artists meant to highlight the state's diverse artistic heritage. The first floor contains exhibits about the area's agricultural history and the development of dairy technology. The barn contains conference and meeting rooms that can be rented out. The barn was developed into part of the park as part of the state's efforts to reuse historic structures. The building was built in 1914 by Alfred I. du Pont as a state-of-the-art dairy barn. The dairy barn and surrounding farm complex were used to provide food for the Nemours estate from 1914 until 1943. From 1943 through 1977, the barn and farmland was leased out to a family of independent operators who sold the dairy produce externally. After 1977, most of the surrounding farm buildings were demolished. The barn was one of the few remaining structures. The Blue Ball Barn had been named after a tavern that dated back to the late 18th century which had been located near the barn. In front of the tavern was a pole with a large blue ball that could be raised or lowered. If the ball was on top of the pole, that served as a signal to illiterate stagecoach drivers that there were passengers which needed to be picked up. If the ball was lowered, the stagecoach would pass by. Recreation Can-Do Playground The rock climbing wall U.S. Route 202 divides roughly a quarter of the park from the rest. This section, referred to as the east park, is primarily reserved for active recreational uses while the bulk of the park to the west of US 202 is designed for passive recreation and preservation of the natural environment. The eastern section of the park includes three athletic fields which are available for permitted use of team sports such as lacrosse, soccer, field hockey, rugby, and kickball. It includes the 26,000 square foot Can-Do Playground, a boundless playground designed and funded by local Rotary Clubs to be fully accessible to children with disabilities. The playground opened in 2007. Nearby the playground is a pavilion and picnic area with outdoor grills. The eastern section of the park is also connected through trails and underpasses to the adjacent Rock Manor Golf Course. The public golf course, owned by the city of Wilmington, was first opened in 1921 and was named after the Rock Manor estate where Alfred du Pont stayed while Nemours was being built. The course was closed in 2005 and then extensively redesigned by Lester George as part of the Blue Ball Project. After it reopened in 2008, it was recognized as part of the American Society of Golf Course Architects' Design Excellence Recognition Program. The western portion has the bulk of the park's hiking and biking trails, including over 2 miles of the Northern Delaware Greenway Trail (part of the East Coast Greenway), a 10.5 mile trail linking Alapocas Run to other northern Delaware sites including Bellevue State Park, Fox Point State Park, Rockwood Museum and Park, and Wilmington State Parks. The .7 mile Alapocas Woods Trail, with the .3 mile PawPaw loop extension, is another trail through the natural areas of the park's western section and is a good place to see the park's mature pawpaw trees. The rock walls remaining from an old granite quarry have been set up to allow rock climbing and rappelling.

It operated as a fraternity, with chapters established in parts of Canada throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. The first registered provincial chapter was registered in Toronto in 1925 by two Americans and a Torontonian. The organization was most successful in Saskatchewan, where it briefly influenced political activity and whose membership included a member of Parliament, Walter Davy Cowan.  Background  The conclusion of the American Civil War in 1865 resulted in the termination of the secessionist movement of the Confederate States of America and the abolition of slavery. The United States entered a period of Reconstruction, during which the infrastructure destroyed during the civil war would be rebuilt, national unity would be restored, and freed slaves were guaranteed their civil rights with the passage of the Reconstruction Amendments. In December 1865, six veterans of the Confederate Army established the Ku Klux Klan in Pulaski, Tennessee. The silent film The Birth of a Nation, glorifying the original Ku Klux Klan, sparked the founding of the second Ku Klux Klan in the United States in 1915. This organization eventually led to the establishment of the Ku Klux Klan in Canada in the 1920s. Presidents Abraham Lincoln (1861‚Äì1865) and Andrew Johnson (1865‚Äì1869) undertook a moderate approach to Reconstruction, but after the 1866 election resulted in the Radical Republicans controlling the policy of the 40th United States Congress, a harsher approach was adopted in which former Confederates were removed from power and freedmen were enfranchised. In July 1868, Congress passed the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, addressing citizenship rights and granting equal protection under the law. The 1868 presidential election victory by Ulysses S. Grant, who supported Radical Republicans, further entrenched this approach. Under his presidency, the Fifteenth Amendment to the constitution was passed, prohibiting federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's \\"race, color, or previous condition of servitude\\". This was followed by three Enforcement Acts, criminal codes protecting African Americans and primarily targeting the Ku Klux Klan. It was the third act, also known as the \\"Ku Klux Klan Act\\", which resulted in the termination of the Ku Klux Klan by 1872 and prosecution of hundreds of Klan members. The release of the film The Birth of a Nation by D. W. Griffith in 1915, glorifying the original Ku Klux Klan using historical revisionism, stoked resentment among some citizens and riots in cities where it screened. The day before Thanksgiving in 1915, William Joseph Simmons and 15 of his friends established the second Ku Klux Klan atop Stone Mountain in Georgia, ceremonially burning a cross to mark the occasion.  Expansion into Canada  J.H. Hawkins, one of the original founders of the Ku Klux Klan of Canada In March 1922, an African American man named Matthew Bullock fled North Carolina after the Ku Klux Klan had stated he was a wanted man, accusing him of inciting riots. His brother had been killed by Klansmen, who the Toronto Star reported at the time had \\"threatened to send robed riders to fetch Bullock and whisk him back to the American south\\". On 1 December 1924, C. Lewis Fowler of New York City, John H. Hawkins of Newport, Virginia, and Richard L. Cowan of Toronto signed an agreement to establish the Knights of Ku Klux Klan of Canada. Funding responsibilities for the provincial organization were split equally among them, and each was a founding Imperial Officer of the Provincial Kloncillum, the governing body of the organization. Fowler travelled to Canada on 1 January 1925 to officially establish the organization. Cowan was the Imperial Wizard (president), Hawkins the Imperial Klaliff (vice-president) and Chief of Staff, and Fowler the Imperial Kligrapp (secretary). They also split the organization's income equally. Fowler left Canada in 1926. During the mid 1920s, Ku Klux Klan branches were established throughout Canada. According to historian James Pitsula, these groups observed the same racial ideology but had a narrower focus than those in the United States, primarily to preserve the \\"Britishness\\" of Canada with respect to ethnicity and religious affiliation. The Ku Klux Klan of Canada made efforts to distinguish itself from the American organization, which used a \\"spectacular level of violent criminality\\" against black Americans and the white Americans who supported them. Hawkins stated at a rally in London that the Canadian Ku Klux Klan was not lawless, that it abided by the laws of the nation, but that it would promote changing those laws it didn't support or did \\"not meet the needs of the country\\". A 1925 photograph of garbed Canadian Klansmen published by the London Advertiser demonstrated that the Klan robes in Canada differed from those in the United States by including a maple leaf opposite the cross insignia. Manitoba Free Press on 25 October 1928. Attempts by the Ku Klux Klan to expand into Manitoba were not successful. One of the most prominent groups was the Ku Klux Klan of Kanada, whose main principles of white supremacy and nationalism required members to pledge that they were white, gentile, and Protestant. Organizers stated that the Ku Klux Klan was a Christian organization with \\"first allegiance to Canada and the Union Jack\\", disqualifying Jews from membership because they are not Christian, and Roman Catholics because their first allegiance is to the Pope in Rome. Although the KKK operated throughout Canada, it was most successful in Saskatchewan, where by the late 1920s its membership was over 25,000. Historian Allan Bartley states that this success was a result of opposition to liberal Government of Saskatchewan policy established by the entrenched Saskatchewan Liberal Party, which had held power in the province since its inception in 1905. In 1991, Carney Nerland, a professed white supremacist, member of the Ku Klux Klan and leader of the Saskatchewan branch of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian Aryan Nation killed a Cree man, Leo LaChance, with an assault rifle. LaChance had entered Nerland's Prince Albert, Saskatchewan pawn shop to sell furs he had trapped.  Operations  Ku Klux Klan members, on foot and horseback, by a cross erected in a field near Kingston, Ontario in 1927 Although distancing itself from the violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan in the United States, the Ku Klux Klan in Canada was engaged in various campaigns threatening those who didn't conform to the Klan's beliefs. It resulted in significant property damage throughout Canada, including the razing of Saint-Boniface College in Saint Boniface, Winnipeg, which resulted in 10 deaths, destruction of the building, and loss of all of its records and its library. Before the official establishment of the Ku Klux Klan in Canada, Catholic churches and property throughout Canada were targets of arson, notably the Cathedral-Basilica of Notre-Dame de Qu√©bec in Quebec City in 1922. These were attributed to the Ku Klux Klan. St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Barrie, Ontario Other violent acts associated with the Klan include the 1926 detonation of dynamite at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Barrie. The man who placed the dynamite in the church's furnace room was later caught, and admitted that he did so on orders from the Ku Klux Klan. The Ontario media, politicians and other civic authorities, and religious leaders spoke out against such violence and against the Klan. By the winter of 1926, Klan membership in Ontario was declining.  Westward expansion  In 1926, American Ku Klux Klan organizers Hugh Finlay Emmons and Lewis A. Scott from Indiana established a Klan organization in Saskatchewan. They spent most of early 1927 travelling throughout the province, establishing local Klan branches and selling memberships for per individual. They also spread Klan propaganda and burned crosses, and in July and August 1927 they made another tour of the province. Soon after, they fled Saskatchewan with the funds they had raised, leaving the Ku Klux Klan floundering. Hawkins and John James Maloney, a seminarian from Hamilton who denounced Romanism, moved to Saskatchewan to revive the organization. Under his leadership, the organization raised over in membership fees and claimed to have registered over 70,000 members. Fees were set at $15 per member annually. Many of its members were supporters of the Conservative Party of Saskatchewan frustrated with the success of the Liberal Party as a result of strong support from Catholics. Under the leadership of Hawkins and Maloney, the Klan became increasingly anti-Catholic and anti-French, and campaigned against the separate school system with the slogan \\"one nation, one flag, one language, one school\\". They opposed \\"crucifixes on public school walls, nuns teaching in public schools, and the teaching of French in public schools\\", blaming these issues on Quebec. (The Constitution Act, 1867 guaranteed provincial rights to education and language, protecting minority rights, including those of Catholics and French-speaking citizens.) At a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan on 10 January 1929 at the Regent Hall in Saskatoon, reverend S.P. Rondeau stated that Quebec was attempting to establish Saskatchewan as a second French- speaking province. Newly founded local chapters would announce their presence to the community with a ritual cross burning. The Imperial Palace of the Kanadian Knights of Ku Klux Klan in British Columbia This became an issue in the 1929 provincial election, ultimately resulting in a coalition government led by James Thomas Milton Anderson of the Conservatives after the Liberals failed to form a minority government. The Ku Klux Klan would appear at many election rallies for James Garfield Gardiner, burning crosses. Gardiner accused Anderson and the Conservatives of being associated with the Ku Klux Klan or seeking its support, but never provided proof. Klan membership included Conservatives, Liberals, and Progressives, and the provincial treasurer (\\"Klabee\\") was Walter Davy Cowan, Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament for Long Lake during the 17th Canadian Parliament from 1930 to 1935. Once they formed the government, the Conservatives condemned the Ku Klux Klan, but their opponents persisted in linking them to the organization until the 1934 provincial election. The Conservative government amended the School Act to ban the display of religious insignia in educational settings, and also amended the provincial immigration policy. The government also terminated recognition of teaching certificates granted by Quebec, effectively halting the recruitment of teachers from that province.  Alberta  Maloney married Leorna Miller, the daughter of William Willoughby Miller who was a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Biggar during the 7th Saskatchewan Legislature led by Anderson. In his book Rome in Canada he states that the Anderson government forgot him, and \\"in their pride and conceit\\" took credit for much of his effort. Bitter at the rejection, he made visits to Ontario then moved to Alberta in 1930, and spoke at 20 engagements that spring at the request of Orange Lodge Grand Master A.E. Williams. Finding competition against William Aberhart (\\"Bible Bill\\") in Calgary difficult, he moved to Edmonton, which he stated was the \\"Rome of the West\\" because of its many Roman Catholic properties. He restored the Alberta Ku Klux Klan, which had been established in 1923 but was poorly organized and managed. He declared himself the Imperial Wizard, and sent for experienced Klan organizers from British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Travelling to as many as five engagements a day in rural areas to establish Klaverns and collect membership fees, the Klan sometimes encountered strong opposition, requiring police protection at Gibbons and Stony Plain, facing a volley of thrown rocks at Chauvin, and prevented from disembarking a train at Wainwright. The Klan celebrated the 1931 election of Edmonton mayor Dan Knott by burning a cross. On two occasions, Knott granted the Klan permission to hold gatherings and erect burning crosses on the Edmonton Exhibition grounds, now known as Northlands. The Klan published a newspaper The Liberator in downtown Edmonton during the early 1930s. Klan meetings were held in the Memorial Hall of the Royal Canadian Legion in Edmonton. The Ku Klux Klan received its charter in September 1932, but questions about the organization's funds led to disputes about Maloney's leadership. On 25 January 1933, he was convicted of stealing legal documents from the office of a lawyer who had opposed incorporation of the Ku Klux Klan, and on 3 February he was convicted of insurance fraud. The downfall of Maloney was chiefly responsible for the discontinuation of the Ku Klux Klan in Alberta.  Policy and propaganda  Cover of the July 1930 edition of The Klansman published in Saskatchewan by the provincial Knights of the Ku Klux Klan In a letter to the Manitoba Free Press on 8 May 1928, J. W. E. Rosborough, the Imperial Wizard for Saskatchewan, stated that the creed of the Saskatchewan Ku Klux Klan was a belief in Protestantism, separation of church and state, one public school system, just laws and liberty, law and order, freedom from mob violence, freedom of speech and press, higher moral standards, gentile economic freedom, racial purity, restrictive and selective immigration, and pure patriotism. T.J. Hind, the reverend of First Baptist Church in Moose Jaw, stated that one of the purposes of the establishment of the Ku Klux Klan was for the protection of the physical purity of current and future generations. Klansmen believed that Canada's immigration policy made it the dumping ground of the world. They falsely stated that of Regina's 8,000 recent immigrants, only 7 were Protestants. They promoted a \\"100 percent Canadian\\" policy to deter the declining influence of Protestant Anglo-Saxon Canadians as a result of increasing immigration from Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, which was primarily Roman Catholic and Jewish. The 5 April 1928 issue of Western Freedman, a publication directed by J.J. Maloney, who was affiliated with the Knights of Ku Klux Klan In October 1927 at a Ku Klux Klan meeting held at Regina City Hall, Maloney said he had received a letter from Plutarco El√≠as Calles, the President of Mexico, in which Calles stated that Mexico had an illiteracy rate of 80% as a result of the Roman Catholic Church's control of the educational system over the previous 400 years. (Calles was staunchly anti-clerical, and during his presidency hostility to Catholics and the enactment of the Calles Law resulted in the Cristero War.) Maloney described the Roman Catholic Church as \\"that dark system which has wrecked every country it got hold of\\", and campaigned to radically change Canada's immigration laws to restrict entry to Catholics. Klan organizers stated that the organization was pro-Protestant and did not discriminate based on political or religious affiliation, but was established to save Canada. Klansmen stated that the organization did not receive fair treatment from the media, and that they were willing to establish their own news presses to disseminate facts about the organization.  Membership  Klanswomen's uniform as shown in a catalogue distributed in Saskatchewan during the 1920s and 1930s In July 1927, a Klan organizer claimed that there were 46,500 members in Saskatchewan. By late 1927, there were 2,300 members of the Ku Klux Klan in Moose Jaw.

It was dedicated on 30 September 1895 by Lillian Russell, one of the most well known actress of the time, who was there to perform in Tzigane. Reginald De Koven, composer of the opera, led the orchestra at Russell's request. In 1905 it was purchased by the Shuberts and David Belasco and was renamed the Belasco Theatre. The theatre was acquired by the US federal government and used as a warehouse until World War II, when it was operated by the American Theatre Wing as a Stage Door Canteen. During the Korean War, it was used by the United Services Organization to entertain troops. The theater was razed in 1964. History The Lafayette Square Opera House as built by John W. Albaugh, on behalf of the Lafayette Square Opera House Company. It was completed in September 1895 at a cost of 250,000 dollars ($ in present day terms). Located on Madison Place NW, just north of Pennsylvania Avenue, the theater faced Lafayette Square and the White House. The site, originally the home of Commodore John Rodgers, was noted for a history of tragic events and believed to be haunted. It was there that Congressman, later Civil War General, Daniel Sickles killed the district attorney for the District of Columbia, Philip Barton Key II, son of Francis Scott Key. Following the Civil War, John Wilkes Booth's co-conspirator, Lewis Powell, attempted to take the life of Secretary of State William H. Seward, who was living there at the time. The property was later purchased by former Secretary of State James G. Blaine, and it was there that he and two of his children, Walker and Alice, died. Program for the Belasco Theater, April 8, 1912 The structure was built of polished gray granite in the classic Grecian order style. Its frontage was 76 feet wide and 176 feet deep. The steel frame building, equipped with the latest fireproof rigging of the time and using an asbestos stage curtain, was advertised is being absolutely fireproof. The main entrance was thirty-six feet wide, and opened directly to the sidewalk on Madison Place. The lobby was finished in mahogany with mosaic tile flooring. Broad marble staircases on either side led to the upper floors. The main floor rose five tiers, constructed on the cantilever, with two Ionic columns on the main floor and three in the balconies. The mezzanine was divided into 31 stalls, one for each President of the United States at that time, each seating four to eight people. The theater had 1,800 seats, \\"not one from which actors can not be seen.\\" The wrought steel front railings of the boxes and balconies were designed by Trost & Trost Architects. The interior was finished in the Italian renaissance style. On the asbestos stage curtain was a copy of Fernand Cormon's painting, Les Vainqueurs de Salamine. The stage itself was 68 feet wide and 45 feet deep. The roof was constructed for use as a theater in the summer months, with seating up to 1,500. The basement was used primarily for a Turkish bath, but did include a barber shop and restrooms. The Belasco Theatre in 1910 The Belasco Theatre (right), c. 1916 In September 1905 it was purchased by the S. S. Shubert Amusement Company and David Belasco for 225,000 dollars ($ in present day terms). It reopened in October as the Belasco Theater. In the 1930s, it was converted to a movie house. In 1940 the Belasco Theatre and its neighboring properties were acquired by the federal government. The theater, with its seats removed, was used as a warehouse until World War II, when parts of it were used by the American Theatre Wing as a Stage Door Canteen. During the Korean War, it was used by the United Services Organization to entertain troops. The theater was razed in 1964 and the site is now home to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims Building.

He was born near the Colorado River in present- day Arizona. Irataba was a renowned orator and one of the first Mohave to speak English, a skill he used to develop relations with the United States. Irataba first encountered European Americans in 1851, when he assisted the Sitgreaves Expedition. In 1854, he met Amiel Whipple, then leading an expedition crossing the Colorado. Several Mohave aided the group, and Irataba agreed to escort them through the territory of the Paiute to the Old Spanish Trail, which would take them to southern California. Noted for his large physical size and gentle demeanor, he later helped and protected other expeditions, earning him a reputation among whites as the most important native leader in the region. Against Irataba's advice, in 1858 Mohave warriors attacked the first emigrant wagon train to use Beale's Wagon Road through Mohave country. As a result, the U.S. War Department sent a detachment under Colonel William Hoffman to pacify the tribe. Following a series of confrontations known as the Mohave War, Hoffman succeeded in dominating the natives, and demanded that they allow the passage of settlers through their territory. To ensure compliance, Fort Mohave was constructed near the site of the battle in April 1859. Hoffman also imprisoned several Mohave leaders. Having been an advocate for friendly relations with the whites, Irataba became the nation's Aha macave yaltanack, an elected, as opposed to hereditary, leader. As a result of his many interactions with U.S. officials and settlers, Irataba was invited to Washington, D.C., in 1864, for an official meeting with members of the U.S. military and its government, including President Abraham Lincoln. In doing so, he became the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president. He received considerable attention during his tours of the U.S. capital, and of New York City and Philadelphia, where he was given gifts, including a silver-headed cane from Lincoln. Upon his return he negotiated the creation of the Colorado River Indian Reservation, which caused a split in the Mohave Nation when he led several hundred of his supporters to the Colorado River valley. The majority of the Mohave preferred to remain in their ancestral homelands near Fort Mohave and under the leadership of their hereditary leader, Homoseh quahote, who was less enthusiastic about direct collaboration with whites. As leader of the Colorado River band of Mohave, Irataba encouraged peaceful relations with whites, served as a mediator between the warring tribes in the area, and during his later years continued to lead the Mohave in their ongoing conflicts with the Paiute and Chemehuevi. Some consider Irataba a great leader who championed peace, but others feel he should have done more to defend the Mohave way of life. The Irataba Society, a non-profit charity run by the Colorado River Indian Tribes, was established in 1970 in Parker, Arizona, where a sports venue, Irataba Hall, is also named after him. In 2002, the US Bureau of Land Management designated in the Eldorado Mountains as Ireteba Peaks Wilderness. In March 2015, Mohave Tribal chairman Dennis Patch credited Irataba with ensuring that \\"the Mohaves stayed on land they had lived on since time immemorial.\\" Background Irataba in 1857 Irataba's name, also rendered as Ireteba, Yara tav, Arateve, Yarate:va, and Yiratewa, derives from the Mohave language phrase eecheeyara tav, which means \\"beautiful bird\\".: Yarate:va, : origin and variations of Irataba's name. He was born into the Neolge, or Sun Fire clan of the Mohave Nation . He lived near a rock formation that gave its name to Needles, south of where the Grand Canyon empties into the Mohave Canyon in present-day Arizona, near the Nevada and California border. The Mohave lived in houses along the riverbank in the Mohave Valley, during winter in half-buried dwellings built with cottonwood logs and arrowweed covered in earth, and in the summer in open-air flat-roofed houses called ramadas. In the mid-19th century, the Mohave were composed of three geographical groups; Irataba was the hereditary leader of the Huttoh Pah group, who lived near the east bank of the Colorado River and occupied the central portion of the Mohave Valley. Mohave government consisted of a loose system of hereditary clan leaders with a head of the entire nation. They were often involved in conflicts with the Chemehuevi, Paiute, and Maricopa peoples. Irataba was a member of the Mohave warrior society called kwanami, who led groups of warriors in battle and were dedicated to defending their lands and people.: the kwanami were a Mohave warrior society; : Irataba was a kwanami, which means brave or fearless; : the role of kwanami in Mohave warfare. Little is known of Irataba's family relations, except for the name of his son Tekse thume, and his nephews Qolho qorau (Irataba's sister's son who succeeded him as leader) and Aspamekelyeho. Olive Oatman, who lived with the Mohave for five years, later stated that Irataba was the brother of the former chief, presumably Cairook, with whom Irataba clearly had a close relation. One anecdotal description states that Irataba had several wives, among them a Hualapai woman who had been taken as a captive and who is also described as having a young son. He also had at least one daughter, the mother of his granddaughter Tcatc who was interviewed in the 1950s. She stated that Irataba had wanted to leave his land deeds and medals to his brother's sons, but that they were eventually lost. In contemporary accounts Irataba was described as an eloquent speaker, and linguist Leanne Hinton suggests that he was among the first Mohave people to become fluent in English, which he learned through his many interactions with Anglo-Americans. Like many Mohave men, Irataba was very tall, particularly by 19th-century standards; the United States Army estimated his height at in 1861. American author Albert S. Evans, writing in The Overland Monthly, referred to him as \\"the old desert giant\\". Edward Carlson, a soldier based at Fort Mohave who knew Irataba well in the 1860s, described him as having a powerful frame, but also a \\"very gentle\\" and \\"kind ... demeanor\\". Irataba lived through a tumultuous period of Mohave history where the people went from being a politically independent nation to coming under the political control of the United States, and the events surrounding his role in these encounters are well documented. Most historical sources for the life of Irataba come from descriptions by white explorers or government agents with whom he interacted, or from contemporary newspapers that reported on his visits to the East Coast and California, and on the conflicts in Arizona territory. Some Mohave versions of the events also exist: in the early 20th century anthropologist A. L. Kroeber interviewed Jo Nelson (Mohave: Chooksa homar), a Mohave man who participated in many of the events and knew Irataba personally; another version was told to ethnographer George Devereux by Irataba's granddaughter Tcatc, and versions recounted by members of the Fort Mohave band of Mohave, the descendants of Homoseh quahote, were recorded by ethnographer Lorraine Sherer during the 1950s and 1960s. Contact with emigrants and explorers Irataba assisted Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves during his 1851 exploration of the Colorado. On March 19, 1851, a family of Brewsterite settlers, the Oatmans, who were traveling by wagon train in what is now Arizona, were attacked by a band of Western Yavapai, probably the Tolkepaya. They captured two survivors of the attack: the 14-year-old Olive Oatman and her 7-year-old sister, Mary Ann. After a year with the Yavapai, the girls were sold to the Mohave, and adopted into the Oach clan where they lived with the family of a Mohave man called Tokwatha (Musk Melon) a friend of Irataba. Olive remained with the Mohave until February 22, 1856, when Tokwatha, having been warned that having a white girl among them might be seen as an offense by whites, brought her to Fort Yuma carpenter Henry Grinnell, releasing her in return for two horses and some blankets and beads.: Olive was released to Henry Grinnell; : Olive and Mary Ann taken captive. Irataba may have learned about Anglo-Americans and their society from Oatman, and knowing her may have contributed to his generally favourable disposition towards Whites. Whipple Expedition On February 23, 1854, Irataba, Cairook, and other Mohave people encountered an expedition led by military officers Amiel Whipple and J.C. Ives, as the group approached the Colorado en route to California. Whipple and his men counted six hundred Mohave gathered near their camp, trading corn, beans, squash (plant), and wheat for beads and calico. By the end of their commerce, the party had purchased six bushels of corn and two hundred pounds of flour. The Mohave played a traditional game played with a hoop and pole, and the two groups entertained themselves with target practice, the Mohave using bows and arrows and the whites firing pistols and rifles. When the expedition had difficulty crossing the Colorado on February 27, several Mohave jumped into the water and helped salvage the supplies. Irataba and Cairook agreed to escort the group across the territory of the Paiute to the Old Spanish Trail that would take them to southern California. German artist Balduin M√∂llhausen accompanied the Whipple expedition, and made drawings of several Mohave, including Irataba. M√∂llhausen's drawings were featured in Ives' 1861 congressional report, making Irataba \\"among the first named likenesses of California Indians ever published\\". Ives Expedition In February 1858, Ives returned to the area in a paddle steamer named Explorer. He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them. The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river, and Cairook, Irataba, and a 16-year-old Mohave boy named Nahvahroopa joined them. M√∂llhausen again accompanied the expedition, and was impressed with the Mohave guides, later noting Irataba's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language. He also noted that Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition, and showed great interest in smoking tobacco. Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook, Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions, a change that he attributed to their contact with Mormons, who were in conflict with the US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave. Irataba guided the party into the Mohave Canyon, indicating the location of rapids and advising the Explorer pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for the night. When they reached the entrance to the Black Canyon of the Colorado, the ship crashed against a submerged rock, throwing several men overboard, dislodging the boiler, and damaging the wheelhouse. Using their skiff, the crew towed the Explorer to the shore, where they camped for three days while repairing the vessel. The expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by the Mohave during the previous weeks; as their supplies dwindled they grew increasingly anxious about the arrival of a resupply pack train from Fort Yuma. Irataba volunteered to hike towards the Mohave Valley to try to locate the supplies that had been requested several days earlier. He also warned that the expedition was being watched by Paiutes. When Irataba returned he informed Ives that he would not venture any deeper into the territory of the Hualapais, but agreed to help them locate friendly guides in the region before parting company. Irataba was reluctant to venture into the canyon because he feared the party would be ambushed by Paiutes aligned with Mormons. After enlisting three Hualapai guides, Irataba prepared to take his leave from the expedition and return to the Mohave community. On April 4, the Mohave received payment for their services; M√∂llhausen described the exchange: \\"Lieutenant Ives informed Irataba that he had been authorized by the 'Great Grandfather in Washington' to give him two mules ... for his loyalty and his trustworthiness so that he could take his possessions and those of his companions more conveniently to his home valley.\\" The next morning, as they were preparing to leave: \\"Irataba was visibly moved ... and in his sincere eyes expressed so much honesty and loyalty as can only be found in an unspoiled nature ... I maintain that there was not one in our expedition who did not feel a certain sadness to see this huge man with ... a harmless soul leave.\\" Mohave War and aftermath Following their experiences with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions, and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma, the Mohave were aware that whites were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers. It was difficult for the Mohave to predict the behavior of the arriving whites, some of whom, like Whipple, were amiably disposed towards them, whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile. The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached; some advocated an aggressive posture, denying whites all passage through their territory, but others, including Irataba, preferred a peaceful approach, or even an alliance with them that could put the Mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies the Paiute, Chemehuevi, and Walapai. On September 1, 1857, a joint force of Mohave and Quechan warriors launched a major attack with hundreds of warriors on a Maricopa village close to Maricopa Wells, Arizona, on the Gila river. The Battle of Pima Butte was described by a group of white mail carriers who witnessed it. They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs, as well as bows and arrows, and that probably more than 100 warriors died, most of them from the attacking party. It is unknown whether Irataba participated in the attack, but given his status as kwanami, it is likely that he did. The battle has been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations. This defeat put the Mohave on the defensive, wary of the possibility that whites would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands. Rose‚ÄìBaley Party attack In October 1857, an expedition led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Los Angeles, California. From Fort Smith, his journey continued through Fort Defiance, Arizona, before crossing the Colorado near Needles, California. This route became known as Beale's Wagon Road, and the location where Beale crossed the river as Beale's Crossing. Beale's journal and subsequent report to the United States Secretary of War did not mention any problems with Irataba and the Mohave, but an assistant named Humphrey Stacy recorded that the Mohave had prevented Beale from traveling downriver. In 1858, the Rose‚ÄìBaley Party comprising at least a hundred settlers with wagons and a large herd of cattle, was the first emigrant train to venture onto Beale's Wagon Road. Upon entering Mohave territory the settlers started cutting down cottonwood trees, which were an important resource for the Mohave. The most warlike of the kwanamis organized an attack on the party, and drove away and slaughtered many of the party's cattle. On August 30, three hundred Mohave warriors attacked the emigrants but were repelled, with one member of the party killed in battle and eleven wounded. Another family who were not with the main party during the attack were killed in an event that has often been blamed on the Mohave, but which in Colonel William Hoffman's opinion was more likely carried out by a band of Walapai, along with seven renegade Mohave. The emigrants killed seventeen Mohave warriors.: emigrant train and attack; : seventeen Mohave warriors. The incident was widely publicized in the media and labeled \\"a massacre\\", scaring many white Californians who feared being cut off from the eastern US by hostile natives, and it motivated the War Department to quickly subjugate the tribe. Irataba was away at Fort Yuma during the attack on the settlers, and upon hearing of it he scolded the Mohave. Chooksa homar participated in the events and reported that Irataba told the warriors, \\"I hear you fought, though I told you not to. And you will have war again: I know it. You used to fight the Maricopa. I want to go [to Phoenix] to see the Maricopa and tell them: 'The Mohave will not come any more to attack you'.\\" Irataba, weary of the constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from the US soldiers, organized a peace expedition to the Maricopa, settling the ancient disputes between the two peoples. Conflict with the US army A sketch of Fort Mohave in the late 19th century When news of the attack reached California, the US War Department decided to establish a military fort at Beale's Crossing to keep the Mohave under control and secure white travelers safe passage through Mohave lands. On December 26, 1858, Hoffman and fifty dragoons from Fort Tejon were dispatched to cross the desert and confront the Mohave. Irataba attempted to arrange a peaceful meeting, but Hoffman ordered his troops to fire on the warriors, who counterattacked and repelled the force.: Irataba attempted to arrange a peaceful meeting; : the Mohave attacked and repelled the force. He returned in April 1859, by way of Fort Yuma, with four companies of the 6th Infantry Regiment. When they arrived at Beale's Crossing, the Mohave decided against attacking the army of five hundred soldiers. On April 23, at Hoffman's request, he and his officers met with several hundred Mohave warriors and their leaders. The indigenous leaders included Cairook, Irataba, Homoseh quahote (also called Seck-a-hoot and Asika hota), and Pascual, leader of the Quechan.: Homoseh quahote attended the meeting; : Irataba and Cairook. During the meeting the Mohave were surrounded by armed soldiers who prevented them from leaving. Hoffman gave the Mohave a choice between war and peace, and he demanded that they agree to never again harm white settlers along the wagon trail. He also declared that, as punishment, the Mohave were required to surrender as hostages a member of each clan and three warriors who had taken part in the attack. Hoffman demanded that the chief who had ordered the attack on the settlers offer himself up as a hostage. According to Chooksa homar, the chief who had ordered the attack was Homoseh quahote, who was reluctant to give himself up. Cairook offered himself in his place, along with eight others, including Tokwatha, Irataba's son Tekse thume, and Irataba's nephews Qolho qorau, and Aspamekelyeho. Other hostages were named Itsere-'itse, Ilyhanapau, and Tinyam-isalye. They were transported in the river steamer General Jessup to Fort Yuma. Many soldiers remained to begin construction on the Beale's Crossing fort, which was named Fort Mohave.: soldiers remained to build a fort; : the fort was initially called Fort Colorado. Although Irataba visited the garrison several times and argued for their release, the hostages were held for more than a year. On June 21, 1859, Cairook and one other captive were killed by soldiers while attempting to escape their incarceration. Most of the other Mohave captives escaped. In July 1861, the commander of Fort Mohave, Major Lewis Armistead, ordered soldiers to fire into a group of Mohave who he suspected of having attacked a mail carrier and slaughtered his mule. The Mohave did not respond violently to the attack, but Armistead decided to punish them for harassing the mail party. He arrived at Irataba's ranch where a group of Mohave boys were planting beans, and from a hidden position he shot one of the planters, killing him. This attack prompted an assault on Armistead's detachment, who from an advantageous position on the high ground were able to repel the Mohave, killing many of them in a battle that lasted most of the day. Armistead's report of the assault of Irataba's ranch reported 23 dead Mohave warriors, but the Mohave remember a much higher number of casualties, including women and children killed by the soldiers. Sherer speculated that, given that 50 soldiers fired around 10 shots each, the casualty count could have been much higher than reported. The attack on Irataba's ranch is remembered by the Mohave as \\"the first and last battle with the Federal Troops.\\" As Aha macave yaltanack Artist's impression of Irataba, February 1864 After Cairook's death, whites living near the Colorado River began to view Irataba as the main leader of the Mohave. He had become Aha macave yaltanack (leader of the Mohave Nation) or hochoch (leader elected by the people); \\"yaltanack\\" is Mohave for \\"leader\\", and \\"hochach\\" means \\"head of a group\\".: becoming leader; : attaining Aha macave yaltanack. Homoseh quahote was a hereditary leader of the Malika clan (\\"the understanding people\\"), and the position of head of the Mohave was traditionally inherited only by someone from that clan. Because Irataba was of the Huttoh pah, in order for him to become the leader of the Mohave Nation, Homoseh quahote had to step down so Irataba, as an elected leader, could take his place. Despite the accepted English translations, the words yaltanack and huchach do not mean a \\"ruler\\" or \\"boss\\". Devereux describes Mohave government as \\"one of the least understood segments of Mohave culture\\", and notes that while white officials \\"tended to act on the assumption that Indian chiefs exercised absolute authority\\", as an elected leader Irataba was \\"primarily a servant of the tribe\\". By the mid-1860s a deep rift had developed between Irataba, who was proactive in cooperating with white settlers, and Homoseh quahote, who passively tolerated but did not approve of white encroachment on Mohave lands. Irataba was Aha macave yaltanack of the Mohave from 1861 to 1866, but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ, and by 1870 US government correspondence suggests that Homoseh quahote had succeeded him as leader of the Fort Mohave group. Mining ventures Probably first to bring national attention to the potential gold in the region was F. X. Aubry, who in 1853 reported finding gold at a crossing of the Colorado and that he traded for legendary gold bullets further east with Tonto Apache. Newspapers across the country copied the gold strike story. Over the next decade mining discoveries up and down the lower Colorado River valley brought miners into newly formed mining districts. In the spring of 1861, Mohave, possibly including Irataba, aided a group of prospectors discover gold in Eldorado Canyon north east of Ft. Mohave, site of first mining rush to the immediate area. This was followed by the discovery of the San Francisco district (now Oatman district), where Irataba led John Moss to the rich Moss lode. Earlier, concern for protecting incoming miners brought together tribal leaders to Ft. Yuma in April 1863, including Irataba, where they pledged to allow prospectors into their country. On his return home, the Mohave joined a prospecting party led by mountain man Joseph R. Walker who had prospected among them on the river in 1860. In 1863, Irataba acted as a guide for the Walker Party, gold prospectors led by Walker and including Jack Swilling, who later founded Phoenix, Arizona. Irataba brought them to a river that he called Hasyamp, later named the Hassayampa River, where they found plentiful gold. Central Arizona's first mining district was established there the following year, which led to the founding of Prescott, Arizona soon afterward. Relations between settlers and the Mohave were positive during this period, but as emigration increased, gold seekers founded towns, largest on the river being named La Paz, stirring fear among settlers of a native uprising against further encroachment on Mohave land. The following year a group of soldiers from Fort Mohave discovered an area between Needles, Fort Mohave, and the Colorado River that was abundant in copper ore. The parcel was named Irataba Mining District, and within the year a mining company had been formed to work it. A small mining town named Irataba City was established on a bluff two miles below Fort Mohave. High copper market prices during the Civil War brought into operation the Bill Williams Fork copper mines as well, which shipped copper ore from the new Colorado River landing of Aubry. Though there would be down turns, mining in the Mohave lands was now well established. Travels Washington, D.C., April 1865 As related above, during the early 1860s, Irataba befriended prospectors as a guide. One of them was John Moss, whom Irataba had shown the location of a gold mine in the Mojave desert, which Moss later sold. Moss suggested Irataba be invited to Washington so that he could see firsthand the United States' military might. In November 1863, Irataba traveled with Moss to San Pedro, Los Angeles, where they boarded the steamship Senator, bound for San Francisco. In San Francisco, he stayed at the Occidental Hotel and created a storm as he walked down Jackson Street, dressed in clothing typical of European Americans, which Irataba soon preferred to traditional Mohave clothing. The press documented his every movement and wrote extensively about his physical size and strong features. On December 2, 1863, the Daily Evening Bulletin described Irataba as a large man, \\"granitic in appearance as one of the Lower Coast mountains, with ... a lower jaw massive enough to crush nuts or crush quartz.\\" Olive Oatman, a former resident of the Mohave In January 1864 they sailed for the Isthmus of Panama on board the Orizaba, then traveled onwards to New York City. Upon Irataba's arrival in New York, Harper's Weekly described him as \\"the finest specimen of unadulterated aboriginal on this continent\\". Here Irataba exchanged his suit and sombrero for the uniform and regalia of a major general, including a bright yellow sash, a gold badge encrusted with precious stones, and a medal with the inscription, \\"Irataba, Chief of the Mohaves, Arizona Territory\\". In February, when The New York Times asked him to explain the nature of his visit, he replied: \\"to see where so many pale faces come from\\". In New York he met with the former Mohave resident Olive Oatman, and the two conversed in Mohave. Irataba told Oatman that her Mohave adoptive sister Topeka, to whom she had grown very close, still missed her and hoped she would return. Oatman described the encounter as a meeting between friends. Irataba moved on to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., where he earned great acclaim; government officials and military officers lavished him with gifts of medals, swords, and photographs. In Washington he met with President Abraham Lincoln, who gave him a silver-headed cane. He was the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president. The tour ended in April, when he and Moss sailed to California, again by way of Panama, and made their way back to Beale's Crossing from Los Angeles by wagon. Upon Irataba's return from Washington D.C., he met with the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about all the things he had seen. He tried to convince them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief. Colorado River Indian Reservation The Colorado River Indian Reservation The completion of Fort Mohave began the process of military subjugation of the Mohave, and the next step was the establishment of reservations. In 1863, Charles Debrille Poston, the first Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Arizona Territory, called a conference between the Chemehuevi and Irataba's faction of the Mohave, in which he convinced them to form an alliance with the US against the Apache. The treaty was never ratified by the US Congress but formed an important step in establishing friendly relations between the Mohave and the US government following the military campaigns and the establishment of Fort Mohave. Poston promoted the idea of establishing a reservation in the southern portion of Mohave country. Many Mohave opposed the proposed location and instead argued for a smaller parcel further north in the Mohave Valley, which had more fertile land. With Irataba and an engineer, Poston traveled down the Colorado River to survey a location. In August 1864 the post commander at Fort Mohave, Captain Charles Atchisson, stated that Irataba was against the proposed location. In September 1864, Poston gave the impression that Irataba was in favor of it. In a letter to General Richard C. Drum, Atchisson reported that Irataba and four Mohave leaders were unhappy with how Poston was handling the situation: alt=A black and white photograph showing a group of approximately 150 Native Americans in European clothing standing at the slope of a ditch with an arid desert landscape in the background Faced with Irataba's disagreement, Poston promised that the US government would assist the Mohave with installing an irrigation system at the Colorado that would make most of the reservation arable. This apparently convinced Irataba, who traveled to the Colorado River Valley with about 800 people, almost a fifth of the entire Mohave Nation.: relocating to the Colorado River Valley; : a fifth of the entire Mohave Nation; : 800 Mohave. General James Henry Carleton thought a reservation was unnecessary, and engineer Herman Ehrenberg disagreed with Poston's proposed location on the basis that the soil was too alkaline for farming, the need for irrigation too great, and the task of raising the river too insurmountable. Nonetheless, on March 3, 1865, Congress established the Colorado River Indian Reservation at Poston's proposed location.: soil was too alkaline Ehrenberg's concerns proved valid, and neither Poston nor any subsequent US authority was willing to dedicate the considerable resources required to make the location suitable for farming. The reservation was established without a treaty having been established between the Mohave and the US government. The boundaries were expanded and clarified by executive orders issued by President Grant in 1873, 1874 and 1867. Most of the Mohave refused to leave their ancestral homelands for the reservation, but Irataba's conviction that the reservation was their best option marked the beginning of a rift between his group and those who stayed behind to follow Homoseh quahote, the nation's hereditary leader. According to an eyewitness account by Chooksa homar, Irataba explained his decision to move: As the promised irrigation assistance was not immediately forthcoming, the first year at the reservation brought a drought that made it necessary for the Mohave to request food assistance. In 1867, Irataba and the Mohave began to build an irrigation canal, digging by hand a ditch that ran for . A report by a US official visiting the reservation in 1870 recorded that attempts by the Mohave at agricultural cultivation on the site were restricted to an area of not more than . Later years Irataba (right) with Yavapai leader Ohatchecama, photographed at the trial following the Wickenburg Massacre (Library of Congress photograph collection) Irataba continued to lead the Colorado River band of Mohave during the 1860s. He pursued peaceful relations with the surrounding tribes and cooperated actively with US authorities. He also helped the Yavapai and Walapai in ongoing conflicts with Paiutes and Chemehuevi. In March 1865, Irataba and the Mohave defeated the Chemehuevi after their allies, the Paiutes, killed two Mohave women. The Mohave pushed the Chemehuevi off their traditional territory and into the California desert, but they soon returned. To avoid fighting a two-front war, Irataba attacked the Chemehuevi first, then turned his attention to the Paiutes, who were planning an attack on the Mohave farm and granary on the Colorado's Cottonwood Island. During a subsequent battle with the Chemehuevi in October 1865, Irataba was taken prisoner while wearing his major general's uniform. According to a contemporary news report based on second hand accounts from white travelers, the captors feared that killing him would invite repercussions from the soldiers stationed at Fort Mohave, so they instead stripped him naked and sent him home badly beaten. In the Mohave account of the events as told by Chooksa homar, Irataba surrendered in an effort to make peace with the Chemehuevi, and offered his uniform to their chief as a gesture of peace. In 1867, a treaty signed by Irataba and the Chemehuevi leader Pan Coyer restored peaceful relations between the two nations. Irataba also welcomed bands of Yavapai onto the reservation after they had been subject to massacres by US troops, or suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands. The meager resources of the reservation proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave. Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army, and participated in peace parlays. In 1871‚Äì72, General George Crook came to the Mohave reservation looking for a group of Yavapai thought to be responsible for the Wickenburg Massacre, and Irataba had no choice but to turn the war party over to the army. He traveled to the trial proceedings at Fort Date Creek, where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible, as a way for him to testify against them without their realizing it. As soldiers attempted to arrest the men that Irataba identified, fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders, Ohatchecama, and his brother were shot. Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet, Ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize the Tolkepaya Yavapai in resistance against the US army. The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba, and plotted to kill him in revenge, but were eventually persuaded that he was not the one who had turned them over to Crook. The Colorado River band of Mohave never replaced Irataba; he was their leader when he died at their reservation on May 3 or 4, 1874. His cause of death is unknown, but smallpox and natural causes are both cited. The Mohave grieved deeply; Irataba's cremation and the rituals of mourning were reported in newspapers as far away as Omaha, Nebraska. Irataba was succeeded as leader on the Colorado Reservation by his nephew, Qolho qorau of the Vemacka clan, who upheld his uncle's policies. Legacy and influence Ireteba Peaks Wilderness Bluewater Resort and Casino, with image of Irataba In 1966, Sherer commented regarding Irataba's legacy amongst the Mohave: \\"Estimation of his position in Mojave history from the Mojave viewpoint differs. To some he is an heroic figure, to others he was a white collaborator who did not stand up for Mojave rights. From the standpoint of white men who were conquering a wilderness, he was indeed the Mojave who worked unswervingly for peace.\\" Irataba's influence as a leader may even have left its mark on the Mohave language. A list of Mohave words that he dictated to an anthropologist during his visit in Washington shows that he was among the first Mohave speakers to shift the sounds [s] and (similar to sh as in \\"shack\\") to (th as in \\"thick\\") and [s], respectively. By the late 19th century all Mohave speakers had adopted this change. Linguist Leanne Hinton has suggested that this may be due in part to Irataba's influence, both because he was a prestigious leader whose ways of speaking may have been emulated by other Mohave, and also because when he led the Mohave onto the reservation the old distinctions between dialect groups were erased through dialect leveling, making new changes spread quickly through the community. The Irataba Society, a non-profit charity run by the Colorado River Indian Tribes, was established in Parker, Arizona, in 1970. The charity holds an annual pow wow or National Indian Days celebration. Irataba Hall, a sports venue in Parker, is also named after him. In 2002, the US Bureau of Land Management designated of the Eldorado Mountains, contained largely within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, as Ireteba Peaks Wilderness. In March 2015, the Colorado River Indian Tribes celebrated the sesquicentennial history of their reservation with a weekend-long event that included cultural activities and a parade. Speakers at the event stressed the important role that Irataba's strong leadership played in establishing and preserving the reservation, and the continuing need for Native leaders to protect native language and culture. Tribal chairman Dennis Patch commented: \\"Some people would think we're lucky, as we have this river and 220,000 acre feet of water ... But we have had great leaders, like Chief Irataba. He made sure the Mohaves stayed on land they had lived on since time immemorial.\\" Former CRIT Museum Director Dr. Michael Tsosie stated, \\"Irataba understood the Mohave people would need to keep fighting to keep what they had.\\" He noted that the Colorado River Indian Reservation \\"is unique in American history in that they have not lost any land\\".

Biography  Rene Lopez II was born August 6, 1969 in the Bronx, the son of an Italian mother and Puerto Rican salsa musician, Rene Lopez Sr., who played trumpet during the heyday of Fania Records with the Ray Barretto Orchestra and T√≠pica 73, bands beloved by New York's Latin community. When a kid, Rene Lopez was heavily into Led Zeppelin and Prince. Especially Prince influenced his music style, to bring different types of music together. Rene Lopez's earliest memories are of standing in the wings of so many stages, while watching his father‚Äîrenowned salsa musician Rene Lopez Sr.‚Äîperform. Sr. played on all kinds of them ‚Äì from small cramped club stages in the Bronx, to Radio City Music Hall, Carnegie Hall, and Madison Square Garden. Rene can still recall the club circuit's heady mix of cigarettes, sweat, and perfume enveloping his senses, and how the music connected the musicians to the audience, and he can still recall wanting to also be onstage. Rene inherited a rich modern Latin music tradition from his father, but over the past 20 years he has built a legacy on his own terms, blurring lines between funk, hip-hop, rock, jazz, EDM, and pop while, along the way, working with a diverse roster of icons. Today, he embraces a new era of his creativity with his Jam Of The Month Club song series. ‚ÄúI went back to the studio, locked the door, and got back to what I loved,‚Äù the New York-based singer, songwriter, producer, multi-instrumentalist recalls. ‚ÄúI still feel like a kid, new ideas keep pouring out and I feel like I have an open palette to work with.‚Äù Throughout his career Rene has worked with Joseph Arthur as well as with members of Wilco, Blind Melon, The Meters, and Spin Doctors, and so many more. He's garnered acclaim from such publications as NPR, Vibe, Magnetic Mag, Joy Of Movement, Earmilk, Pop Shifter, Relix, Pancakes and Whiskey, Paste, Seen It Heard It, Mix Tape Maestro, The Aquarian, and The Washington Post, among countless others. Rene's groundbreaking band in the 1990s, The Authority, blazed through the boundaries of hip-hop, Latin, and funk, playing gigs alongside P-Funk, The Meters, and Fishbone, earning accolades from jam band fanatics and hip-hop heads, who used to pack like sardines into The Wetlands and Nightingales to see them. Later, Rene started the band Wasabi with the legendary John Popper of Blues Traveler. As a solo artist, he's released four albums and EPs that defy category, traversing intimate singer songwriter, traditional Latin, soul, funk, and pop rock. He began his career as a gifted drummer, and was part of the first wave students at the New School jazz program that also included John Popper, Eric Schenkman (Spin Doctors), along with modern jazz innovators Jesse Davis and Brad Mehldau. During this formative time, he studied with legendary drummer Bernard Purdie (The Beatles, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, The Rolling Stones) who gave Rene his first opportunity to step forward from behind the kit as a singer and songwriter. At the most basic level, what struck Rene as a kid standing stage side at his father's shows was how those slinky salsa rhythms made people's body's move. That musician to audience relationship was about rhythm. Throughout his musical journey, first through exploring metal drumming, then funk, jazz, and a myriad of Latin styles, that rhythm connection would be central. Rene's artistry has matured into an aesthetic he's come to refer to as E.L.S. (Electric Latin Soul). ‚ÄúNew York is a melting pot of cultures and musical sensibilities‚ÄîBrazilian music, Latin clave rhythms, 1980s electro-funk, and classic soul‚Äîand they all meld together in my head. I don‚Äôt label it, and I have no fear exploring these as an artist.‚Äù Other disciples of groove compose vamps, but Rene has always been attentive to songcraft, putting that discipline on equal footing with his rhythms. While at the New School, Bernard Purdie conducted a songwriting contest. The winner would have his songs recorded at the famed New York studio The Record Plant. Rene submitted the first songs he ever wrote, and soon found himself making his debut with Bernard Purdie producing. That fateful turn of events changed his life as a musician, shifting his focus to composition and singing, and sending him on a profoundly winding and rewarding musical journey. All roads led to the Jam of the Month Club. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so gratifying the creativity is so wide open, and every month I get to put a smiles on faces with free music. This is what music should be about,‚Äù Rene shares. The first track debuted in September with ‚ÄúHeavy Baby Heavy‚Äù an invigorating homage to intelligent women bursting with sleek stanky funk that recalls the electro grooves of 1980s Prince and The Time. Rene has consistently offered a broad array of funky gems since. A recent highlight has been the deep swampy-soul of ‚ÄúWatch Me Turn It Up‚Äù recorded in New Orleans and featuring some of the Crescent City's finest, including George Porter Jr. from The Meters on bass and Ivan Neville on Hammond B-3 organ and piano. Watching those masters perform Rene's music was a career highlight. ‚ÄúIt was so special, it made me feel like my funk was true.‚Äù Other spotlight jams are the psych-funk freak out ‚ÄúU Can Bet On Me,‚Äù featuring iconic bluesy vocalist Irving Louis Lattin, and a true 1980s feel. Rene's father put down his horn many years ago in favor of a steadier living, and to this day Rene remains inspired by his father's legacy. ‚ÄúMy father is so proud of me that I‚Äôve stuck to it. He always says he‚Äôs blown away by my creativity. It means so much to me. I‚Äôm so excited to share my latest jams with him.‚Äù NPR's Alt.Latino referred to Rene Lopez's music as one of Alt.Latino's favorites of 2014.

It will be funded by the Canada Job Fund, a fund transfer from the federal government to provincial and territorial governments, which will be responsible for implementing the program. It will enable individuals to receive up to in training services, funded by the federal government and the individual's employer. Establishment Passage of the 2013 federal budget resulted in the establishment of the Canada Job Grant in 2014, a training fund stipulating that the federal government would provide for an individual's training in trades and skills, but requiring matching funds from provincial governments and the individual's employer. The program is part of the federal government's strategy to develop skills for jobs that were not being filled, or were being filled by temporary foreign workers. The federal government expected to fund the annual million program by renegotiating the Labour Market Agreement it had with the provinces, which expired in 2014. The Labour Market Agreements were federal transfers of $500 million to the provinces used to assist vulnerable workers. Objections The fund's announcement during the 2013 federal budget speech was criticized by provincial representatives. Brad Duguid, Ontario's Minister of Training, Colleges, and Universities, stated that the program would shift million from programs \\"that target our most vulnerable and have the greatest barriers to entering the workforce\\". Quebec's Minister of Finance, Nicolas Marceau, stated that the federal government was \\"undoing and sabotaging what Quebec has long been doing\\". On 22 March 2013, Labour Minister Agnes Maltais of the Government of Quebec formally requested exclusion from the program. It prefers to operate its own program, instead of participating in a joint federal-provincial program. Objections were also raised by First Nations about a five-year million skills training program available only to reserves that make it \\"mandatory for those receiving income assistance payments to be retrained\\". Provincial government officials also stated that it removed full control of spending of the funds by the provinces. Marceau described it as \\"economic sabotage\\". At the July 2013 Council of the Federation at Niagara-on-the-Lake, premiers unanimously opposed the Canada Job Grant. Kathleen Wynne, the Premier of Ontario, stated that the proposed fund was \\"not going to work the way it is\\". Brad Wall, the Premier of Saskatchewan, stated that businesses in Saskatchewan may not benefit from the program because the province was at full employment and that the province needed basic skills training programs for vulnerable individuals. Provincial governments did not want federal funding for the program to be taken from the labour market agreements it had with each province since 2007. The million program, representing a reallocation of 60% of federal labour market agreement contributions to the provinces, would necessitate the provinces funding programs operated via the labour market agreement by other means. These programs, which are considered successful, ensured continued employment for 86% of participants two years after training. The 2014 federal budget specified that Service Canada would operate the Canada Job Grant in jurisdictions with which the federal government failed to secure agreements. Wes Sheridan, the Minister of Finance, Energy and Municipal Affairs for Prince Edward Island, described it as a \\"take it or leave it Canada Job Grant program\\". Marceau stated that this was a \\"thinly veiled threat to Quebec and the other provinces\\". Negotiations Jason Kenney, the Minister of Employment and Social Development, negotiated terms of the funding program with provincial and territorial ministers in February 2014. The deal required provinces to allocate 10% of the Labour Market Agreement to the training fund, and required an additional 10% of funding each subsequent year from any source of federal government transfers to the provinces (for example, the Labour Market Agreement or Labour Market Development Agreement). The deal also removed the requirement that the provincial and territorial governments provide matching funds. Instead, the federal government assumed two-thirds of the cost to train each individual, with the other portion funded by the individual's employer. An exception for small businesses was also introduced, reducing their required contribution to 15% of the cost (from 33%). The federal government also agreed to perform a review by December 2015 to evaluate the effectiveness of the training program. With the deal in place, the federal government negotiated implementation deals with each provincial representative. Adoption The program is expected to fund training for 130,000 individuals annually when it is fully operational. Training must be provided by an eligible third-party training operator for employees of private and not-for-profit companies. About one-third of the funding for each employee trained will be provided by the employer, and the remainder by the federal government. The program is for short duration training of at least 25 hours completed within one year. It may be provided in a classroom, online, or on- site, and will pay for tuition, examination fees, texts, and other training material. Applications must be submitted by employers on behalf of individuals being sponsored, or by self-employed individuals, and the trainee must be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or subject to the Protected Persons Entitled to Work in Canada. Six provincial governments signed agreements for funding training via the Canada Job Grant. These were the Government of Alberta, Government of British Columbia, Government of Manitoba, Government of New Brunswick, Government of Ontario, and the Government of Quebec. These will be funded by Canada Job Fund agreements, which will replace the Labour Market Agreement the federal government had with each province. Alberta Alberta Works administers the program in Alberta. British Columbia On 24 October 2014, the government of British Columbia and the federal government announced the Canada-British Columbia Job Fund Agreement to replace the Labour Market Agreement previously in place between the two governments. The $65 million annual fund includes $38 million for the Canada Job Grant. The provincial government began accepting applications from employers the same day. It is expected to provide training for 900 individuals in its first year of operation, about 3,500 individuals annually once fully implemented in 2017, and 16,000 individuals overall. Manitoba Manitoba was the first province to implement the program, and began accepting applications in July 2014. New Brunswick The government of New Brunswick signed an agreement in principle with the federal government in March 2014, by which the program would provide for $11 million annually for six years in funding for training. Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland and Labrador began accepting applications in August 2014. Ontario The Government of Ontario signed the Canada-Ontario Job Fund Agreement with the federal government on 28 March 2014, providing two pilot programs operated by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities.

The Commission found that GSK‚Äôs agreement had the object of restricting competition, given that the agreement served to partition the internal market. GSK appealed against the finding.

Along with the remnants of the adjoining Saint Luke's Bell Tower (Zvonik svetog Luke/–ó–≤–æ–Ω–∏–∫ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≥ –õ—É–∫–µ), it is a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The buildings are located in the historic centre of the city of Jajce, at the foot of the citadel.  Origin and description  The building has undergone a series of redesigns, which makes difficult establishing its age and the original appearance with certainty. It is assumed that the church was first built as a simple Romanesque-style basilica in the 12th century. It had deteriorated significantly by the end of the 14th century, when it was restored and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is not clear who commissioned the restoration of the building; circumstantial evidence points to either the Franciscans who had settled in the area or, somewhat less likely, to Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá, the Kingdom of Bosnia's leading magnate and founder of the city of Jajce. The church was re-adapted to the more popular Gothic style in the early 15th century, after the kings of Bosnia acquired Jajce in connection to King Ostoja's marriage to Hrvoje's widow, Jelena Nelipiƒá. The surviving frescos, dating from the first half of the 15th century, are typical of the Late Gothic art; the most significant composition depicted the Last Judgment, a common theme in contemporary Europe.  Royal church  Following his loss of Serbia to the Ottomans in 1459, King Thomas's son, Stephen, returned to Bosnia with his wife Maria, and her family. Maria brought along the relics of Luke the Evangelist, and a bell tower, bearing the saint's name, was erected next to the church. On 17 November 1461, the church served as the place of coronation of King Stephen; it was the last coronation in Bosnia. The Ottoman conquest of Bosnia took place two years later, commencing the centuries-long Ottoman rule over Bosnia. King Stephen was executed in the process, while Queen Maria took the relics and sold them to the Republic of Venice.  Mosque  In 1582, Saint Mary's Church was converted into a mosque and named after the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. The building burned on several occasions. The most devastating fire occurred in 1658. The last fire, in 1832, left behind nothing but walls, and the building has not been used since.

He was then admitted to the seminary in Kassa and, as one of the best students there, was sent to study at the P√°zm√°neum in Vienna.M≈±v√©szet: Biography and critical appreciation by K√°roly Lyka (1909) In 1890, he returned to L≈ëcs√© and experienced a sort of epiphany while spending time in the nearby pine forests. He decided to take up drawing but, unable to achieve the desired effects with a pencil, turned to using a pen instead. In 1891, he enrolled at the University of Budapest where he continued his linguistic and literary studies, but persevered with his drawing and sent one of sketch books to , who encouraged him to pursue his interest in art. After a visit to T√∂lgyessy's studio in Margitta, and with the support of his brother Bertalan, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna and studied landscape painting with Eduard Peithner von Lichtenfels. He also took classes in etching from William Unger (1837-1932), which had a decisive influence on his work. He left the Academy in 1893 and began spending the winters with his family in Bacsk√≥. In 1902, he became a lithographer and went to Beszterceb√°nya, where he helped to create a literary and art magazine called \\"Havi Szemle\\" (Monthly Review), which he edited. His brother was a major contributor. It was published for only three years. In 1906, he was invited to become head of the graphics department at the Hungarian University of Fine Arts. He remained in that position until his death and was active in the organization and administration of several professional art societies.Brief biography @ Magyar Elektronikus K≈ënyvt√°r.

As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players, with results announced on January 6, 2016; Ken Griffey Jr. and Mike Piazza were elected to the Hall of Fame. The Pre- Integration Committee, the last of three new voting committees established during an earlier rules change in 2010 to replace the more broadly defined Veterans Committee, convened in December 2015 to select from a ballot of players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport prior to 1947 - called the \\"Pre-Integration Era\\" by the Hall of Fame - but failed to select any inductees. The Hall of Fame induction ceremonies was held on July 24, 2016, at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, with commissioner Rob Manfred presiding. On the day before the actual induction ceremony, the annual Hall of Fame Awards Presentation took place. At that event, two awards for media excellence were presented - the Hall's Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters and the BBWAA's J. G. Taylor Spink Award for writers. The other major Hall of Fame award, the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award, was not scheduled to be presented again until 2017. BBWAA election On July 26, 2014, the Hall announced changes to the rules for election for recently retired players, reducing the number of years a player will be eligible to be on the ballot from fifteen years to ten. Two candidates presently on the BBWAA ballot (Lee Smith and Alan Trammell) in years 10-15 were grandfathered into this system and retained their previous 15 years of eligibility. In addition, BBWAA members who were otherwise eligible to cast ballots were required to complete a registration form and sign a code of conduct before receiving their ballots, and the Hall will make public the names of all members who cast ballots (but not their individual votes) when it announces the election results. The code of conduct specifically states that the ballot is non-transferable, a direct reaction to Dan Le Batard turning his 2014 Hall of Fame ballot over to the sports website Deadspin and allowing the site's readers to make his Hall votes (an act that drew him a lifetime ban from future Hall voting). Violation of the code of conduct will result in a lifetime ban from BBWAA voting. The most recent rules change, announced on July 28, 2015, tightened the qualifications for the BBWAA electorate. Beginning with the 2016 election, eligible voters must not only have 10 years of continuous BBWAA membership, but also be currently active members, or have held active status within the 10 years prior to the election. A BBWAA member who has not been active for more than 10 years can regain voting status by covering MLB in the year preceding the election. As a result of the new rule, the vote total in 2016 decreased by 109 from the previous year, to 440.\\"Ken Griffey Jr. (99 percent of vote), Mike Piazza head to Cooperstown\\". espn.go.com. January 6, 2016. Retrieved January 6, 2016. The BBWAA ballot was announced on November 9, 2015; ballots were submitted by December 21, and results were announced on January 6, 2016. The ballot included two categories of players: * Candidates from the 2015 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, as long as they first appeared on the BBWAA ballot no earlier than 2002. * Selected individuals, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2010. All BBWAA members with at least 10 years of continuous membership and active membership status at any time in the preceding 10 years were eligible to vote. There were 440 total ballots cast with 3496 individual votes for players, an average of 7.95 players named per ballot. As in most recent elections, the controversy over use of performance- enhancing drugs (PEDs) is likely to dominate the election. ESPN.com columnist Jim Caple noted in the days before the announcement of the 2012 results that the PED issue and the BBWAA's limit of 10 votes per ballot was likely to result in a major backlog in upcoming elections: Caple's predictions about the players on the 2015 ballot, as well as the players he expected to be elected before then, mostly proved accurate. Larkin was indeed elected in 2012, and Maddux, Glavine and Thomas were elected on their first ballot appearance in 2014. The main exceptions were Palmeiro and Williams, who got less than 5% of the vote in prior elections and failed to stay on, and Biggio, who fell short of election in both of his first two years on the ballot, missing out in 2014 by two votes. Biggio was finally elected in 2015. Another ESPN.com writer, Tim Kurkjian, noted that the 2013 ballot would include several new candidates who either tested positive or were strongly linked to PEDs: In his first year on the ballot, Ken Griffey Jr. received 99.3% of the vote, a BBWAA election record. Mike Piazza finished second at 83.0% and was the only other player elected. Alan Trammell and Mark McGwire were on the ballot for their final time. Neither were elected, meaning they will not be eligible for further consideration by the BBWAA. Following a July 2016 rule change, they will be considered eligible for consideration by the Veterans Committees, which has now been split into four eras. In , McGwire appeared on the post-1988 (Today's Game) committee ballot, authorised to consider all MLB figures whose greatest contributions occurred after 1987, with the restriction that the only players that can be considered are those whose BBWAA eligibility has been exhausted. McGwire received fewer than 5 votes. In , Trammell appeared on the Modern Baseball committees ballot, authorised to consider all MLB figures whose greatest contributions occurred from 1970 to 1987, with the restriction that the only players that can be considered are those whose BBWAA eligibility has been exhausted. Trammell was elected, receiving 81.3% of the vote. Other committees include pre-1949 (meeting decennially), 1950-69 (quintennially), and the two biennial committees that will skip when the quintennial and decennial committees vote, the 1980‚Äì87 and the aforementioned post-1988.

Pre-Integration Era Committee In keeping with the voting procedure by eras, the BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee, made up of 11 BBWAA members, identified ten Pre- Integration candidates who were judged to have made their greatest contributions from the origins of the sport to the end of baseball's color line in 1947. This era was previously under consideration in the 2013 election, when three candidates were elected; Bill Dahlen was the only other candidate to receive more than three votes. Along with the era, these rules defined the consideration set: * Players who played in at least 10 major league seasons, who are not on Major League Baseball's ineligible list (e.g., Shoeless Joe Jackson), and have been retired for 21 or more seasons. * Managers and umpires with 10 or more years in baseball and retired for at least five years. Candidates who are 65 years or older are eligible six months after their retirement. * Executives retired for at least five years. Active executives 65 years or older are eligible for consideration. However, due to the passage of time, the only listed criteria that materially restricted the field from which the candidates were selected were years of service and presence on baseball's ineligible list. The eleven BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee members were Dave Van Dyck (Chicago Tribune); Bob Elliott (Toronto Sun); Jim Henneman (formerly Baltimore Sun); Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau); Rick Hummel (St. Louis Post-Dispatch); Bill Madden (formerly New York Daily News); Jack O'Connell (BBWAA secretary/treasurer); Jim Reeves (formerly Fort Worth Star-Telegram); Tracy Ringolsby (MLB.com); Glenn Schwarz (formerly San Francisco Chronicle); and Mark Whicker (Los Angeles News Group). All except Henneman and Reeves were members of the committee that selected the 2013 candidates. The Pre-Integration ballot for election was released on October 5, 2015; final voting was conducted by the Pre-Integration Committee, a 16-member body which met at baseball's winter meetings in Nashville on December 6, with 75% (12 of 16 votes) required for election; results were announced the following morning. The committee's members, appointed by the Hall of Fame's board of directors, were announced later in fall 2015 and included members of the Hall, baseball executives, members of the media and historians: *Hall of Famers: Bert Blyleven, Bobby Cox, Pat Gillick and Phil Niekro *Executives: Chuck Armstrong, Bill DeWitt, Gary Hughes and Tal Smith *Media/Historians: Steve Hirdt, Peter Morris, Jack O'Connell, Claire Smith, Tim Sullivan, T.R. Sullivan, Gary Thorne and Tim Wendel Blyleven, Gillick, Niekro, DeWitt, Hughes, Hirdt, Morris, Smith and T.R. Sullivan previously served on the committee which selected the 2013 inductees. For the second consecutive year, none of the candidates received enough votes for election; it marked the third consecutive year - and the fifth time in seven years - in which no former players were chosen by the Hall's special committees. Speaking on MLB Network's Hot Stove immediately after it broadcast the announcement, Major League Baseball's official historian John Thorn expressed surprise and disappointment at the results, noting that he had felt there were three particularly strong candidates (prior to the announcement, he had commented favorably on the candidacies of Doc Adams and Harry Stovey); he speculated that the number of good candidates may have deadlocked the voting once again, and suggested that the Hall may need to amend the voting process in the future. At the time of the election, figures from this era were scheduled to be considered prior to the 2019 inductions. However, in July 2016, the Hall announced changes to its era-based committee system, replacing the three then- current committees with four new voting bodies. The Pre-Integration Era body was replaced by the newly created Early Baseball committee. The new committee will consider figures whose greatest contributions occurred before 1950 (a slightly broader time frame from its predecessor), but will not hold its first meeting until 2020 as part of the 2021 election process. Most significantly, this committee will meet only once a decade, specifically in years ending in 0. The candidates for election were: {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" !scope=\\"col\\"|Candidate !scope=\\"col\\"|Category !scope=\\"col\\"|Votes !scope=\\"col\\"|Percent |-   Pioneer 10 62.5% |-   Player 8 50% |-   Player 8 50% |-   Executive < 4 < 25% |-   Player < 4 < 25% |-   Executive < 4 < 25% |-   Player < 4 < 25% |-   Player < 4 < 25% |-   Executive < 4 < 25% |-   Player < 4 < 25% |} Breadon, Dahlen, Ferrell, Marion and Walters were previously candidates on the 2013 ballot. J. G. Taylor Spink Award The J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now given the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter \\"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum. On December 8, 2015, Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy received 185 out of 417 of the votes cast, making him the 2016 recipient of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award. Ford C. Frick Award The Ford C. Frick Award, honoring excellence in baseball broadcasting, has been presented at the induction ceremonies since 1978. Through 2010, it had been presented at the main induction ceremony, but is now awarded at the Awards Presentation. Recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the museum. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two. The honor is based on four criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans. This was the third and final Frick Award selection under a process similar to that instituted for Veterans Committee balloting in 2010. Under this process, candidates were considered every third year, based on the era in which they made their most significant contributions: * \\"Broadcasting Dawn Era\\" ‚Äî 1920s to early 1950s, including the early radio broadcasters. Individuals from this era were considered for the 2016 award. * \\"High Tide Era\\" ‚Äî Mid-1980s to present, including the rise of regional cable networks. Individuals from this era were last considered for the 2014 award. * \\"Living Room Era\\" ‚Äî Mid-1950s to early 1980s, including the rise of television. Individuals from this era were last considered for the 2015 award. As part of the rules changes announced in July 2016, the Hall also announced changes to the Frick Award selection process, effective with the 2017 award. While the process will continue to involve three annually rotating voting bodies, the groups of candidates to be considered by each committee have changed. The newly established committees will rotate in the following order: \\"Current Major League Markets\\" (team-specific broadcasters), \\"National Voices\\" (national broadcasters), and \\"Broadcasting Beginnings\\" (early broadcasters). In addition, the number of finalists will be reduced from 10 to 8, and the three ballot slots that had been filled by fan voting on the Hall's Facebook page will now be chosen by a committee of baseball historians. Ten finalists from the \\"Broadcasting Dawn Era\\" were announced on October 6, 2015. In accord with the current guidelines, seven were chosen by a Hall of Fame research committee, while the other three were selected (for the final time) from a list of candidates by fan voting at the Hall's Facebook page from September 14 to October 2. * Jack Graney * Harry Heilmann * Al Helfer * France Laux * Tom Manning * Graham McNamee * Rosey Rowswell * Hal Totten * Ty Tyson * Bert Wilson All of the candidates were deceased, with the most recently living among them being Laux, who died in November 1978. Heilmann is a Hall of Fame member as a player. On December 9, McNamee was announced as the recipient. The Hall's official announcement called him \\"quite possibly the first celebrity sportscaster... renowned as the most recognized personality during radio‚Äôs formative years.\\" He began his broadcasting career in 1923 with WEAF (now known as WNBC) in New York City, and called 12 World Series, countless other baseball games, and 10 other sports until his death in 1942.

Plot As described in a film magazine, when the American Civil War veterans staying at an old soldiers' home in a small town hear that young men are not volunteering for military service, they attempt to enlist but are rejected, much to the amusement of some idle young rich men. This includes Randall Lee (Dearholt), whose father Thomas Lee (Burton) owns large mining interests such as the local Top Copper mine. Davy Glidden (Pickford), a boy scout whose father Adjutant Glidden (Geldart) is in charge of the old soldiers' home, wants to serve but is too young to join the army. While on a secret investigation, Davy overhears two German spies, Carl Bender (Farley) and Frank Schmale (Hastings), planning to cripple the Lee mine and take a large amount of its product back to their native land. With the assistance of men from the old soldiers' home, the spies are rounded up and brought before the laboring men of the mine before they can do any damage and the Edwards family, who had been visiting the Lee's, are saved. Davy believes that he is in love with the Edwards' daughter Flora (MacDonald), although she is several years older than him. Randall sees the bravery of Davy and the veterans of the old soldiers' home and, ashamed of himself, enlists.  Cast  Reception Like many American films of the time, The Spirit of '17 was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors required a cut of a scene with the cutting of telephone wires.

It is a design of magnetic compass that facilitates steering a steady course without the risk of parallax error. The grid compass is the simplest steering compass from the pilot's or helmsman's point of view, because he doesn't need to watch the number (or the division mark) of the wanted course. He has only to steer the craft so that the N/S compass needle lies parallel between the lines of the overlay disc. The principle is similar to the compass-controlled autopilot. Although sophisticated electronics have taken over for commercial navigation, light aircraft, gliders and yachtsmen still use the grid compass because of its simplicity and ease of use. Description The compass card is in the form of a bold parallel sided arrow which indicates magnetic north. Some models have an east/west cross bar as well. Overalying this but in the same gimbal or suspension is a transparent plate which can be rotated around the same axis as the compass card but has sufficient friction (or a mechanical clamp) to stay fixed relative to the gimbal system once set to a course. Across this disk are engraved a series of parallel lines. The outer edge of this disk is marked in clockwise in degrees, the radial line meeting 0¬∫ being parallel to the engraved lines, so that a course can be laid for any bearing from 0¬∫ to 359¬∫. By keeping the arrow on the card and the lines on the overlay parallel, the pilot or helmsman can keep the course set. The frequency of the degree markings depend upon the size of the compass. To set a course the rotating ring is (unlocked and) turned so that the heading in degrees on the ring alines with the centre line of the craft. The craft comes on to the required course when the arrow on the compass card is parallel with the lines on the ring. The grid steering compasses (Type P8 to Type P11) were fitted in World War II Spitfire aeroplanes, replacing the old P4 series of instruments. They were used for course setting and reading, and as a check compass on aircraft fitted with a remote indicating compass.Grid compass description See also *Astrocompass *Compass *Silva Compass *Solar compass *Marine sandglass  References   Bibliography  *Aircraft Instruments *  External links  * A Compass for ‚ÄòSandpiper‚Äô * \\"A Job Thought Impossible\\", the story of Chrysler Corporation's mass-production of previously hand-made compasses for World War II naval requirements.

Haiku applications are usually available as HPKGs; however, unpackaged applications can be installed by using Haiku PackageInstaller for legacy BeOS apps or manually unzipping the install files into one of the non- packaged installation folders. Haiku comes with a set of mostly small yet essential applications. Core applications are an essential part of Haiku, as they serve many different purposes. Haiku also has some 3rd party applications to supplement the core applications. The applications are usually executed by double clicking on the icon.  Core Applications   ActivityMonitor  ActivityMonitor is a system monitor, making it possible for users to analyse the performance and function of their hardware. They can view components such as the memory being used, cached memory, and CPU usage. ActivityMonitor presents the information in graph form, which makes it easy for the users to understand their computer performance.  CharacterMap  Haiku CharacterMap is a Character Map utility that shows the UTF-8 Code of every character a font supports. The font size can be changed and the user can drag any character into the StyledEdit application or the character can be copied and pasted where needed.  CodyCam  CodyCam is a photo and video capture program that makes it possible for the user to take pictures at a specified interval from a connected webcam or any other video-in device and upload it via FTP. Users can specify the file's name; the image and video format; the capture interval and the network details for uploading to a FTP server.  DeskCalc  DeskCalc is a simple Calculator that can perform different tasks related to mathematics. It has a simple interface and on the front screen it has some functions or buttons which can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division but it is not restricted to these only. DeskCalc can also perform tasks related to trigonometry. The type of the calculator can also be changed into scientific, radical or any other type to use it for different purposes.  DiskProbe  DiskProbe is a Hex editor to view and alter data of a file or on a device on a byte-level. It is a very low-level tool which means that only the ones who are familiar with such language can use them and one wrong command can change the whole nature of the program so developers have to be careful when using this. At the start, a file has to be chosen by the user to edit it further in the application. The main view shows a block of data and its size can be changed and offset can be set as well.  DiskUsage  DiskUsage is a Disk space analyser application that provides graphical information to the user showing the disk space being consumed. 'Scan' button has to be clicked once the user executes the application in order to start the scanning process. The application provides a pie chart showing the volume of space being used. Users can understand the graph and can utilise that data in many different ways. Every segment of the circle represents a folder and when the cursor is taken above one of them, its information comes on the status bar. The user can choose to re-scan the folder if they want to. They can also open it with another application or can fetch further information about the memory consumed.  DriveSetup  DriveSetup is a harddisk partitioning tool that allows the user to create, delete and initialise partitions. It gives a graphical representation of all partitions on devices which are chosen in the device list below the graph. The maximum number of primary partitions which may be extended or can be logical partitions is limited to four. Partitions can be mounted or unmounted by using some commands after choosing a partition from the list.  Expander  Expander is the default file archive handler for Haiku and is used to quickly unpack the most common archives, among them zip, gzip, bzip2, rar and tar.gz, provided the appropriate command-line utility is installed (zip and gzip are natively supported by the distribution). When a compressed archive file is chosen by the user that they wish to expand and uncompress, they can then choose the destination folder for the expansion; which is where the expanded files will be stored.  HaikuDepot  HaikuDepot is the native package manager for the Haiku operating system which was integrated into Haiku after its R1A4 release. Most applications on Haiku now run from their packages but are virtualised as virtual directories on the Be File System.  Installer  Installer is a System Installer tool that is used to install Haiku to a partition. It makes it possible for the user to copy Haiku onto another volume. The installer needs a prepared partition. Haiku can also be added manually but using Installer is preferred over that because adding it manually is harder than using the installer. The user has to choose the source of the software which may be any CD or USB and has to choose the target destination. 'Begin' has to be clicked in order to start the installation process.  Magnify  Magnify is a Screen magnifier application that allows the user to magnify particular content or the whole display. Magnify lets the user to zoom in and magnify the content near the cursor. Tasks such as saving the image, increasing the pixels, copying the image and many other tasks can be done by the user.  MidiPlayer  MIdiPlayer is an application that plays back MIDI audio files.  PackageInstaller  PackageInstaller is a software installer for BeOS packages in PKG format. It provides a GUI that helps in package installation in Haiku. Installation type or the destination may be chosen here by the user. The application shows the progress of the installation while the installation takes place.  PoorMan  PoorMan is a simple personal web server bundled with the Haiku operating system.  Screenshot  Screenshot is an application for capturing screenshots of the screen. Although this can be done manually by pressing (the Print Screen key), by using the screenshot application the user can take advantage of other features that are unavailable when only using the key method. With the application the user may choose to capture only the active window or windows, to exclude the yellow tab bar and border or to choose to include the mouse pointer as well. With the application the user can also rename the files, can set up a delay or interval, can change the save destination etc.  SoundRecorder  SoundRecorder is a tool used to record audio from some input device such as the microphone. The user may start, pause or stop the recording at any time he wants with the buttons assigned to these tasks. Volume can be increased or decreased too.  StyledEdit  StyledEdit is a basic text editor. However, it is able to use Haiku's extended attributes to create elementary word processor functions such as the use of different typefaces, and styles such as bold and italic. The resulting file, when loaded into a text editor that is unaware of extended attributes, is presented b y the other editor as a simple text file.  Terminal  Haiku Terminal is a Terminal emulator that is Haiku's interface to bash, the Bourne Again Shell. Bash is a Unix shell written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. The user can open as many terminals as the user wants to on different tabs or windows. There are different commands which can be used while using Terminal and they can be used to change the settings, to customize the bash or the profile etc.  TextSearch  TextSearch makes it possible for the user to search for some characters, letters, words or even sentences in any text file. They can choose the type of files in the settings menu as well. It looks for a string in text files, which can be copied, deleted, edited by the user or they may perform some other tasks related to the text. They can also view the history of their searches and can view encoding menu to choose different characters.  Tracker  Tracker is a graphical user interface based file manager for managing fileswith Haiku. It is somewhat similar to Finder on Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X. The Haiku version of Tracker is based on OpenTracker which in turn is an open sourced version of the Tracker found in the BeOS.  TV  TV is a viewer for Analog TV. It is used to view different channels on Haiku. It is not a web-streaming app and requires a TV Card to start using it. Once the setup is completed, the user may set different frequencies or view different channels. Vision An IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client for Haiku.  WebPositive  WebPositive (also called Web+) is the graphical web browser included with Haiku since version R1A2.  3rd Party  The following 3rd party programs are bundled with Haiku. Many more can, however, be installed using the HaikuDepot application.  BePDF  BePDF is a PDF viewer.  Pe  Pe is an advanced text editor, intended mainly for programming and development purposes.

It is named after Alice Zirkle, a co- founder of the company. The Lady Alice apple has a dense and crispy texture and a rich heirloom-like complex flavor, sweet with hints of tart. It is typically stored after harvest and sold to the retail customer at the flavor's peak. It is suitable for fresh eating as a snack, as well as for cooking and baking. Among its specialty characteristics is that it does not brown quickly even if cut open, and keeps shape and texture at high temperature baking. Lady Alice is distinguished from other cultivars with its pink blush over creamy- yellow background; the background color darkens after harvest. The fruit is harvested in the fall, and can be available between February and May, especially in March when it is at its best.

It is Grade II listed. 180px A three-arch stone road bridge crosses the river nearby, also Grade II listed and possibly dating back to the late 18th- century (one of its arches is over the mill leat). There is also a Baptist chapel, originating in the 18th-century, though the existing building dates from 1833. A commercial woollen mill is in operation in buildings behind the water mill, producing woven goods but currently specialising in making stair carpets. It made a carpet for the Carmarthenshire residence of Charles, Prince of Wales.

He played college football at Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania and later coached college football at North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now North Carolina State University (1916), Waynesburg University (1924), and Manhattan College (1927). Playing career Patterson played college football at the tackle position for the Washington & Jefferson Presidents in 1913 and 1914. He was selected as a first-team member of the 1914 College Football All-America Team by the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin; the Pittsburgh Sun (as selected by sporting editor James J. Long); the Philadelphia Evening Telegraph, (as selected by sporting editor Louis M. Toughill); the Philadelphia Public Ledger (as selected by Robert W. Maxwell); the Boston Post (as selected by Charles H. Parker), and Tom Thorp in the 'New York Evening Journal.Spalding's Official Football Guide 1915 The 1914 Washington & Jefferson team compiled a 10‚Äì0‚Äì1 record, defeated Yale, and fell one point short of a national championship after losing to Harvard by a score of 10‚Äì9. Patterson was a bulwark of the team's line, and his ejection from the Harvard game in 1914 was credited with allowing Harvard to overcome an early deficit and win the game. One newspaper noted: > \\"Had Patterson remained in the game Harvard never would have been able to > make those great gains through tackle -- and Harvard never would have won . > . . Patterson's football record is clean. He never before was chased from a > game for roughness. No man that ever played against him justly can accuse > him of 'dirty' playing. Patterson always played the game to the fullest > limit of his great power. He opened holes when he was called upon to do it, > and he held back his enemies when such action was necessary. But he always > did it fairly, honorably, and in keeping with the rules of the game. And so > Patterson's action, even though it lost the game for W. & J., even though it > robbed W. & J. of a wonderful honor, is an excusable action and one which > should not reflect upon his football record, which has been as bright and as > clean as that of any man who ever played the game.\\" Patterson sustained an injury to his knee cap during a game against Georgetown during the 1914 season. In February 1915, a newspaper account reported that he had been \\"crippled probably for life\\" as a result of the injury, was required to walk with a crutch and had dropped from 225 to 175 pounds.

The park, which is around 360 acres, preserves the former home and estate of the Marshall family as well as portions of the family's former mills alongside the Red Clay Creek and additional land purchased by the state. The preserve contains several miles of trails open to walking, biking, and antique cars, and the state owns conservation easements on 160 acres of privately owned land adjacent to the park to help maintain the park's rural character. The park also features what the state bills as the largest collection of operational steam cars in the world, and a miniature coal-powered train that runs on tracks encircling the estate. The mansion, mills, and steam museum were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as the Auburn Mills Historic District. Park history Interest in preserving land near the Red Clay Creek was first expressed to the state by local residents and conservation groups in 2000. With the nearby National Vulcanized Fiber company looking to downsize, there was a general agreement among advocates that an opportunity for conservation had presented itself. Tom Marshall, the owner of a local estate, began donating portions of his land to the Delaware Nature Society for conservation purposes. The state began acquiring land for a preserve in 2002, with a purchase of 104 acres of NVF land for $3 million and a purchase of 65 acres of Marshall's old land from the Delaware Nature Society for $2.3 million. Additional purchases of 19 acres were made in 2005, bringing the preserve's total size to almost 200 acres. It was made a state park in 2008. After NVF declared bankruptcy, the state purchased 42 of the company's 119 acres of land, bringing the main portion of the preserve to a total of 234 acres. The state also acquired conservation easements on much of the remaining NVF land and began working with its purchasing developer to establish a plan which would maintain open space, build a network of trails through the valley, and help revitalize the mill town by adaptive reuse of historic structures. On November 9, 2018, Auburn Heights Preserve was renamed and dedicated as Auburn Valley State Park, with Governor John Carney, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, DNREC Secretary Shawn M. Garvin, and other state and local officials in attendance at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Auburn Heights Mansion The Auburn Heights Mansion was built in 1897 by Israel Marshall, the descendant of a family of local farmers that immigrated to the United States in the seventeenth century. In 1890, Israel and his brother, T. Elwood Marshall, purchased the nearby mill. The home was built in a Victorian style, and is situated on a large hill so that it overlooks the mill complex, and the town of Yorklyn, below. The fully furnished home and 4 acres of surrounding land were donated to the state in 2008 by Tom Marshall, the grandson of Israel Marshall. The park provides tours in which visitors can learn about the family as well as the industrial history of the region. Oversee Farm The Oversee Farm is a separate unit of the park that is nearby, but not connected to the main portion of Auburn Heights Preserve. The farm is the former estate of Eleanor Marshall Reynolds, Tom Marshall's cousin. Reynolds purchased the farm in 1945, intending to see it preserved for future generations. Contained within the farm property are stretches of forest, freshwater marshes, open fields, and scenic views of Red Clay Creek. Following her death in 2003, Reynolds' son Warren sold the 125 acre farm to The Nature Conservancy in order to see it preserved, and the conservancy worked with the state to transition the farm to the ownership of the state's parks department. Plans call for the farm to be connected to the main unit of the preserve through the park's network of trails by passing through privately owned land on which the state owns conservation easements. Marshall Steam Museum Marshall Steam Museum T. Clarence Marshall, the youngest son of Israel Marshall and the father of Thomas Marshall, was fascinated by the steam power that operated the family's mills. He became a licensed dealer for Stanley Motor Carriage Company and began acquiring a personal collection of steam automobiles. The collection was first opened to the public in the 1970s. Following its donation in 2008 by Tom Marshall, the collection is owned by the nonprofit Friends of Auburn Heights Preserve which operates the park in partnership with the state. The collection is housed in the Auburn Heights carriage house, where a team of volunteers maintains the vehicles so that they remain fully operational. Included in the collection are 15 Stanley cars and several steam and electric cars from other manufacturers. The Museum's collection also includes a 1/8-size steam locomotive that runs on tracks around the estate called the Auburn Valley Railroad. Visitors are able to view the collection, and on certain days rides on the cars and trains are offered to the general public. The park has a field trip program in which visiting students can learn about the history of transportation technology and steam power.

It was built simultaneously with the construction of Z√ºrich's new quays between 1881 and 1887.  Geography  Quaibr√ºcke is situated at the outflow of Lake Z√ºrich and connects the B√ºrkliplatz with the Bellevueplatz, and hence the lake's left (or western) shore with the right (or eastern) shore. It is a nodal point of the Tram lines 2, 5, 8, 9 and 11, as well of the road traffic between General-Guisan-Quai, and Utoquai.  History  1880-1884 Quaibr√ºcke around 1890 The Quaibr√ºcke was erected between 1880 and 1884 under the management of Arnold B√ºrkli (1833‚Äì1894), the city engineer appointed in Zurich in 1860. A modern land connection was urgently needed after an intense political campaign, as in 1893 Zurich was to be expanded by including 11 neighboring municipalities (\\"Vorortgemeinden\\"). On May 18, 1873, the municipal council (the legislature) approved the construction of the Quay Bridge with a strong majority vote. In a vote on September 4, 1881, the municipalities of Enge (left, west shore), Riesbach (right, east shore), and Zurich approved the financing loan. In the outcome of the conducted tender procedure for project planning works, four submitted offers were opened on September 5, 1881. As the probes of the Zurich lake bed on the designated area revealed that it was covered by layers of mud above sandy clay loam deposits, the proposed pile foundation of the bridge was the decisive factor. Arnold Br√ºckli's proposal was inspired by solution implemented for the building of \\"Neue B√∂rse\\" in Basel (later known as Basler Handelsbank and ultimately the predecessor of UBS AG). On March 18, 1882, the contract was awarded to Zurich architect Emil Schmid- Kerez, in collaboration with Philipp Holzmann & Cie. from Frankfurt and Gebr√ºder Benckiser from Pforzheim. The project group undertook to complete the construction works of a 20 meters wide bridge (12 meters of roadway lanes, and 4 meters of pedestrian walks on each side) on or before July 15, 1883 against a payment of CHF 860'000.00. The Quaibr√ºcke was built simultaneously with the Utoquai and General-Guisan-Quai on the two shores of Lake Zurich, but the bridge was finished half a year earlier. Since the bridge disabled the traffic on the Limmat, the landing gate of the ZSG Z√ºrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft had to be moved from the Bausch√§nzli island to the present B√ºrkliterrasse. 1930s-1940s In 1932, the road surface was renewed. In view of the Swiss National Exhibition 1939 and expected increase in traffic, the city council envisaged to further develop the Bellevueplatz and the Quaibr√ºcke, and the width of the bridge was increased to 28.5 meters in 1939. Upon German invasion of Poland in the WWII and as part of the Z√ºrich lakefront, two machine-gun bunkers were built in the 1940s, which are still preserved at their original sites at Limmatquai and B√ºrkliterrasse. The construction at B√ºrkliplatz was designed by the Stadtkommando Z√ºrich (Zurich City Commando) as a concrete machine gun stand in the wall of Quaybr√ºcke and was erected during May and June 1940 in form of a gallery with a sequence of five battle rooms (\\"Kampfr√§ume\\") lined up next to each other. Due to its layout of five Kampfr√§ume and the central location in the very heart of Zurich, the bunker was nick-named as \\"5-Zimmer-Villa\\" (five bedrooms villa). In March 2004, the site was declassified. 1983-1984 Commemorative panel at the Quaibr√ºcke Due to rapidly increasing maintenance costs, the original construction had to be replaced in 1984, and a new bridge was built parallel to the old bridge between 1983 and 1984, on steel girders. The weekend of March 16/17, 1984, traffic was blocked and the old construction was moved on steel beams and columns in the lake which took 15 hours in total to move the old construction and replace it with a concrete slab. The construction costs totaled to 18 million CHF, and the width of the bridge measured from then on 30.5 meters. Initiatives to redesign the old bridge as a pedestrian zone were rejected. 2015 Between April and November 2015 further refurbishment works were completed with 50 cm wide steel structures added on both sides of the bridge to move the existing combination masts (lighting poles and guy masts) and free up space to be used for pedestrian and bicycle paths.

It was designed by Reyburn Jameson and built in 1931 and extended in 1939 and 1948. It is also known as the Pink Palace, after a nightclub which operated out of the building in the late 1970s and 1980s. The building now serves as offices for the Mental Illness Fellowship of Queensland. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 December 1999.  History  The Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse was constructed in two stages, 1931 and 1939, as the clubhouse for Brisbane's first municipal golf links, established in Victoria Park in 1930-31. The modern game of golf originated in Scotland in the 18th century. By the late 19th century it was popular throughout Britain, and in the 1880s and 1890s, British immigrants established golf clubs throughout the British Empire. Golf was introduced to Queensland in the 1880s by two Scots, Francis Ivory and his brother Alexander, who laid out a six-hole course on their Eidsvold cattle station, near Gayndah. Golf courses at Ravenshoe and Townsville (1893) are the first recorded Queensland courses. The Brisbane Golf Club, formed in 1890, was the first organised golf club in Queensland. It established a course at Chelmer in 1896 and subsequently relocated to Yeerongpilly in 1904. It was a private club, attracted the patronage of Lord Lamington (Governor of Queensland 1896-1901), and until 1920 was the only golf club in Brisbane. The City Golf Club Toowoomba was formed in 1896 with a nine- hole course on Drayton Road and the Ipswich Golf Club was established in 1897. However, golfing was not widespread in Queensland by the turn of the century. The game was the preserve of the affluent, with founders and club members mostly from professional and business sectors. High membership fees and the cost of golfing equipment often excluded the less well-to-do from the sport. Queensland entered a period of prosperity in the 1920s, which engendered a new enthusiasm for public sport and recreation. Bowling and golfing in particularly became very popular. Many new players were women, who had gained a greater social freedom during World War I, although generally in golf clubs they were admitted as associates rather than as full members. Several new private golf clubs were established in Brisbane in the 1920s: the Royal Queensland Golf Club at Hamilton in 1920, followed by clubs at Sandgate (1921), Wynnum (1923), Goodna (now Gailes) (1924), Indooroopilly (1926), Oxley (1928) and Nudgee (1929). A round of golf was considered to be eighteen holes but by 1929 there were only three eighteen-hole courses in Brisbane: Brisbane, Royal Queensland and Indooroopilly. The other Brisbane courses were nine-hole courses played twice to achieve the stipulated round. In the 1920s, municipal golf courses were established throughout Australia, enabling broader social access to the game. Successful municipal courses established in Sydney (1920) and Adelaide (1922), which provided the public with affordable facilities and at the same time generated municipal revenue, stimulated moves for the creation of Queensland municipal courses. The Queensland Golfing Association, eager to foster golf in Queensland, first approached the Mayor of Brisbane in 1922 with a proposal for a nine-hole municipal course at Victoria Park. In 1924 the Toowong Town Council investigated the possibility of establishing a municipal course on One Tree Hill (Mt Coot-tha) and Taringa Shire Council also investigated developing a course, but both proposals were abandoned. In 1923 the Ipswich City Council took over the Ipswich Golf Club and established the first municipal course in Queensland, with public play commencing in 1924. Following the formation of Greater Brisbane in 1925, the Brisbane City Council prioritised the provision of parks and public reserves, and the establishment of sport and recreation facilities within these areas. A large section of Victoria Park - established in York's Hollow in 1865 - had been reserved as the site for a new University of Queensland since , and had lain largely undeveloped. When the University announced in 1926 its decision to build at St Lucia instead, the Queensland Golf Association again raised the issue of establishing municipal golf links at Victoria Park. This time the proposal was greeted with enthusiasm by the Council. Both the first Lord Mayor of Greater Brisbane, Alderman William Jolly, and the Town Clerk, Stanley Eldred Travill, were tireless supporters for the establishment and development of the municipal golf course at Victoria Park. Jolly became the inaugural president of the Victoria Park Golf Club and remained in this office until 1934. He was made a life member in 1935 in recognition of his services to the Club. The proposal was supported also by Parks Superintendent Harry Moore, who estimated that the cost of developing the land as a park would be ¬£50,000 to ¬£60,000 - far in excess of the cost of establishing a golf links. Some delay in implementation was experienced due to the slow process of transferring much of Victoria Park back to the City Council. A course was designed by Stan Francis, who laid plans before the Council in February 1930 and who supervised the laying out. Much of the work on the course was completed under the Intermittent Relief Scheme, and was well in hand by September 1930 when the council put out tenders for the construction of the clubhouse. This building was situated at the northeast corner of the course because it allowed players to return in an easterly direction, as advised by Francis. It was also close to the tram along Bowen Bridge Road, which was convenient for players. The clubhouse was designed in the office of the City Architect, Alfred Herbert Foster, with plans drawn by Assistant Architect Reyburn Jameson. The building was in the Spanish Mission style, popular for recreational interwar buildings such as bathing pavilions and picture theatres, and which had been used in the design of the Council's Moora Park Kiosk at Sandgate (erected 1928). The 1931 clubhouse Work on the clubhouse commenced early in 1931, and it was ready for occupation in September. The links were completed a couple of months later, and the Victoria Park Golf Course was opened officially on 20 November 1931. Final construction cost for the course and clubhouse was ¬£13,919 (course ¬£9,794; clubhouse ¬£4,125). To ensure the successful functioning of the new course, the Victoria Park Golf Club was formed at a public meeting on 20 March 1931, at which it was confirmed that the Council provided the course, clubhouse, the salaries of a Club Secretary and Club Professional, and assumed responsibility for the upkeep of the course, while the Club members were responsible for the operations of the Club. Any casual player was entitled to play the course without joining the Club, on payment of the appropriate green fees. The Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse boasted every modern facility, but no bar, as many members of the Council were not in favour of making alcohol available. There were protests about this lack, both as a facility to members and as a revenue-earner. The Council eventually gave permission for a bar, which was opened on New Year's Day, 1935. Constructing the 1939 extensions Associates (women members) playing cards, 1940 During the depression years of the 1930s many private golf clubs lost membership, but that of the Victoria Park Golf Club doubled between 1933 and 1937. In response to this expansion and to be able to continue to attract membership, the clubhouse was extended and remodelled in 1939 by City Architect, Harold Erwood. Wings were added to either side of the existing building, with the additions and alterations focussing on improved member and associate services and facilities, including new lounge and dining room areas with a timber dance floor upstairs; a doubling of locker space, toilet and shower facilities; private rooms; modern kitchen; independent access for women; and new exterior lighting. The upper floor also provided new living accommodation for the club secretary, in the eastern wing. The layout, incorporating facilities for women in the west wing and those for men in the east wing, reflected a marked social separation between the sexes. The extended building opened on 26 October 1939 and continued in use throughout the Second World War, despite the original 17th and 18th fairways being occupied as a military encampment. The lounge area of the clubhouse was extended in 1948 and the ground floor was refurbished in 1963. The Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse was one of the larger public buildings erected by the Greater Brisbane Council, and the golf links remained the only municipal course in Brisbane until the establishment of the St Lucia Golf Course in 1985. Other civic work produced by the Brisbane City Architect's office during the interwar period included bandstand rotundas, kiosks, dressing sheds and toilet blocks. This work ranged across a number of styles and generally care was given to their design. Tramway substations and the New Farm Powerhouse were designed by engineers in the Council's Tramways Department. The course was considered to be one of the finest municipal golf courses in Australia and has been described as the cradle of golf in Brisbane. Under the tutelage of Arthur Everett Gazzard, foundation professional 1931-72, some players went on to become professional golfers in the Queensland and Australian arenas. In the mid-1970s a new clubhouse was constructed on the brow of the hill between Herston Road and Gilchrist Avenue, and was opened on 14 December 1975. The links were altered so that the ninth and eighteenth holes were near the new clubhouse, changing Francis' orientation of the course. The 1930s clubhouse was vacated at this time. It was tenanted from 1978 by the Lone Parent Club of Queensland, and through the 1980s operated as a disco venue for single parents known as \\"The Pink Palace\\", named for its then brightly-painted facade. It was then abandoned for many years, during which time it was vandalised and inhabited by squatters. In 2009-10, it was restored by its owners, the Brisbane City Council, in order to serve as office space for the Mental Illness Fellowship of Queensland.  Description  The former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse is a large, freestanding, two-storeyed brick building rendered with a rough cast finish, located in the north-east corner of the Victoria Park Golf Course bounded by Gilchrist Avenue and Herston Road, Herston. The main entrance towards Gilchrist Avenue overlooks Victoria Park below and a bitumen carpark occupies the former putting green terrace between the building and the road. The main elevation is symmetrical about a centrally projecting gabled entry porch which was the core of the 1931 building. The 1939 alterations and additions are in the non-identical wings flanking the central bay and the terminating pavilions to the east and west. The building conveys the impression of a Spanish-Mission or Mediterranean character established in the 1931 design but the overall impact is of thoughtful classicism within a restrained use of Spanish references. The three bays of the main entrance porch, now glazed to form an enclosed entry vestibule, are punctuated by square columns with rounded concrete brackets. The balcony above the entrance porch has three round arched openings with decorative concrete balustrade panels. The glazing to these openings was a later addition. A gable vent of curved tiles sits below the low pitched gable roof clad with Marseilles tiles. Within the west loggia, a stairtower sits between the formal entrance and the minor entry porch which has a decorative roof edge capping of round tiles. The upper loggia has two sets of paired open round arches screened with timber blinds. At ground level in each of the end pavilions, a projecting central bay capped with round roof tiles is flanked by pairs of casement windows decorated with wrought-iron window grilles. Slender half columns in a stylised Corinthian order define the corners of the bay and casement windows with a scalloped fringed sill are recessed within the bay. At the upper level of each pavilion a continuous sill wraps around the corners below three generous window bays which in the west wing are filled with sets of casement windows and in the east with louvres. The wings have Marseilles- tiled hipped roofs with bracketed eaves. From Herston Road the tiled roof and upper level of the building peep through the vegetation around the perimeter of the property. This elevation is asymmetrical about a central gabled bay. Three separate pedestrian bridges cross from Herston Road to the upper level connecting with the latticed porch entrance to the living quarters and the dining room. The south-west and south-east corners continue as wrap-arounds from the main elevation. A plain pilaster with a round tile decorative coping above the capital is located one-third the way along each side elevation and finishes the corner. To the west four bays of metal framed casement windows at the upper level afford views across the Golf Course. The building plan accommodates access and vertical circulation within the loggias to the front of the building and services and storage along the rear. At ground level the pavilions contain the locker/changing areas. The upper level contains the large dining room, ancillary service areas, meeting spaces and the living quarters in the east pavilion. From the reception vestibule a metal staircase to the right arrives at the upper level loggia. The reception vestibule opens into the main bar area. Evidence suggests that later openings have been made in the wall between the main bar area and the west pavilion. The stair from here arrives at the upper loggia which connects to the dining area. At ground level, the east wing houses a billiard room and toilet/shower facilities. An acoustic tile ceiling has been inserted in the new reception and main bar areas. Plain plaster ceilings are found elsewhere throughout the ground floor. The toilets in the west wing retain original finishes and the former women's shower area has been altered to accommodate male toilets. The men's shower, change and toilet facilities in the east wing remain. The upper floor contains a spacious lounge and dining area, kitchen, bar, storage, meeting room and living quarters. Windows to the west offer an extended view across the Golf Course. The low-ceiling of the dining space is punctuated by plain plaster rendered ceiling beams finished with decorative corbels at the wall junctions. An extensive hardwood dance floor survives. The dining area and the meeting room open to the front balcony and east loggia which offer a fine prospect to the old Exhibition Building, the RNA showgrounds and lower Victoria Park. The living quarters of the east pavilion are accessed from the east loggia and include a bathroom, kitchen, living room, bedroom, storage area, balcony and rear verandah entrance to Herston Road. In contrast to the restrained decoration of the public areas the living quarters has a number of decorative cornices in an Art Deco style. Some mature trees from the original landscaped setting remain around the former Clubhouse. A chain wire fence on a tuff base sits on the retaining wall to the rear. Housings in the tuff base suggest that this was formally a timber fence. Concrete steps and a buggy ramp from the tram/bus stop in Herston Road provide smooth access for golfers and buggies from the roadway to the Course. Access from Course to Clubhouse is provided by a similar set of concrete steps and buggy ramp adjacent to the former first tee. A low painted stone wall with two sets of steps to the old Clubhouse forms an edge to the carpark. Approximately half way along the former first fairway a substantial set of stairs arrives on the Course from Gilchrist Avenue. The stairs are of concrete and hammered tuff with a concrete plaque bearing the date 1936.  Heritage listing  The former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 December 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse, erected in the 1930s, is important for its association with the development of golf as a popular recreational sport in Queensland. The establishment of the Victoria Park Golf Course in 1930-31 as Brisbane's first municipal golf links, along with the formation of the Victoria Park Golf Club and the construction of a purpose-designed clubhouse, illustrates the Greater Brisbane City Council's strong commitment to the development of public recreational facilities during the interwar period. The former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse is an integral element within an historic precinct situated around York's Hollow and along Bowen Bridge Road between Gregory Terrace and Breakfast Creek, which has been important in the evolution of Brisbane's and Queensland's history. This area includes the residential, ecclesiastic and educational structures along Gregory Terrace overlooking Victoria Park, Bowen Park, an early tram shelter shed adjacent to Bowen Park along Bowen Bridge Road, the RNA Grounds, the former Exhibition Building (Old Museum Building) at the northeast corner of Gregory Terrace and Bowen Bridge Road, the Exhibition Railway, Victoria Park, Centenary Pool Complex, the Electricity Sub-station at the northwest corner of Bowen Bridge Road and Gregory Terrace, Victoria Park Golf Course, the former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse, Royal Brisbane Hospital, and the University of Queensland Mayne Medical School. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is both a good example of Brisbane City Council civic architecture of the period, and a rare interwar recreational building designed and constructed by the Brisbane City Council. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse is a substantial interwar civic building in Brisbane. It is both a good example of Brisbane City Council civic architecture of the period, and a rare interwar recreational building designed and constructed by the Brisbane City Council. In its Spanish Mission references, the building embodies the then popular association of this style - often employed in designs for picture theatres and bathing pavilions - with recreational activity. The more formal neo-Georgian 1939 extensions are mindful of its civic presence, reflecting the success of the municipal golf links as a Council venture in the 1930s. The former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an interwar clubhouse, accommodating the principal elements necessary to the successful functioning of a golf clubhouse of this era, including locker and associated ablutions areas for members and associates, segregated by gender; a separate entrance and lounge area for female players; an administrative station; living quarters for the Club Secretary; and clear physical and visual links with the golf course proper. The building retains clear evidence of the 1939 gender segregation in the arrangement of internal spaces and circulation patterns. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Despite having lost much of its park setting, the building retains an aesthetic value: the exotic suggestion of the Spanish Mission references, tempered by the neo-Georgian restraint, combine to create a robust, elegant sports pavilion. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has social significance for its close association with the popularisation of golfing in Brisbane and in Queensland for over four decades. It also has one of the last large timber dance floors in Brisbane, and has been associated with Brisbane social functions such as balls, dinners, and receptions for many decades.

Early life Griffitts was born into a Quaker family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and lived in that city for the entirety of her long life. Her parents were Thomas and Mary Norris Griffitts, and she had a sister, Mary, and a brother, Isaac. As a granddaughter of the merchant Isaac Norris, Griffitts was a member of a prominent Pennsylvania Quaker family. One of Griffitts' second cousins was Mary Norris, who would marry Founding Father John Dickinson, and another cousin was Hannah Harrison, who later married leading Patriot Charles Thomson. Griffitts knew early on that she wanted to be a poet, and when she was just 10 years old she made a promise to God that her poetry would include \\"no trifling themes\\". In 1751, with both her parents dead and her brother Isaac in disgrace because of financial misdeeds and alcoholism, she went to live with some of her Norris cousins at an estate known as Fairhill. She stayed at Fairhill for over a decade, becoming especially close to Mary Norris, and the two corresponded regularly as adults. Griffitts never married, at one point writing, \\"everyone is not fitted for the single Life, nor was I ever moulded for the wed[d]ed one.\\" From the 1770s to the 1790s she took in and cared for several elderly relatives, among them her sister Mary. Poetry Griffitts is best known for a series of scathing satires that celebrate the American colonists' opposition to Britain in the decades before the American Revolution. For example, she wrote several proto-feminist poems about the Daughters of Liberty, a group of women active in protesting British policies in the Thirteen Colonies. \\"The Female Patriots\\" (1768) contains references that are implicitly critical of the Sugar Act of 1765 and the Townsend Duties of 1767, which were measures intended to raise revenues in the colonies by taxing and controlling goods such as molasses and tea. In the poem, Griffitts also castigates male colonists who fail to stand up to the British: > Since the Men from a Party, on fear of a Frown, Are kept by a Sugar-Plumb, > quietly down. Supinely asleep, & deprived of their Sight Are stripped of > their Freedom, and robbed of their Right. If the Sons (so degenerate) the > Blessing despise, Let the Daughters of Liberty, nobly arise, And tho' we've > no Voice, but a negative here. The use of the Taxables, let us forebear. > ‚Äîfrom Hannah Griffitts, \\"The Female Patriot\\" Despite her stirring rhetoric, Griffitts, like many other Quakers of the period, was uneasy at the prospect of violence and supported a negotiated solution to overtaxation rather than outright revolution. After war broke out, she raged against radicals like Thomas Paine (calling him a \\"Snake beneath the Grass\\" in one of her poems) whose views had prevailed over those of the moderates. She refused to leave Philadelphia even after it was seized by the British, and she continued to maintain her antiwar stance. Although the neutralist American Quakers were sometimes seen as de facto Loyalists during the war, Griffitts was as quick to criticize the British as the Americans. For instance, she perceived the Mischianza‚Äîan elaborate f√™te that the British arranged in 1778 to honor General George Howe on his departure for England‚Äîas an example of the degeneracy of British culture. Griffitts' writing throughout her life reflected empathy with people's suffering, and she wrote many elegies for parents who had lost their children, as well as for fellow Quakers and friends like the poet Susanna Wright. In this period, the British and American literary establishments were largely hostile to the work of women poets. Perhaps in reaction to this situation, Griffitts did not attempt to publish her poems, instead circulating them among her largely female network of friends and acquaintances. A few found their way into print, probably without her authorization, in such publications as the Pennsylvania Chronicle, and the Pennsylvania Evening Post. Recent scholarship has shown how women of the period used commonplace books as a method of creating a private, informal historical record of their own era. Some 60 of Griffitts' poems are included in her second cousin Milcah Martha Moore's commonplace book, a compilation of poetry and prose that was first published in 1997 under the title Milcah Martha Moore's Book. Under the pen name 'Fidelia' (derived from the Latin fidelitas meaning 'faithfulness' or 'loyalty'), Griffitts is one of the three dominant contributors to Moore's commonplace book, along with Susanna Wright and Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson, whose salon at Graeme Park was one of the literary centers of Philadelphia. Apparently, Griffitts used this pseudonym only when sending out clean copies of her poems; she signed her letters with her real name, and her own rough drafts often carry her initials. A small paperback volume of draft poems and working notes is still extant. Griffitts died in 1817, and her manuscripts (including several hundred poems and a large number of letters) are now held by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

Shiloh Baptist Church, c.1902 Location The Shiloh Baptist Church, also known as the Shiloh Negro Baptist Church, located at the corner of 7th Avenue and 19th Street, was at the time the largest black church in Birmingham. The church was crowded with approximately 3,000 people to hear Booker T. Washington address the National Convention of Negro Baptists. Event According to contemporary accounts published in the New York Times, the disaster occurred after Washington concluded his remarks. A convention delegate from Baltimore engaged in a dispute with the choir leader concerning an unoccupied seat. Someone in the choir yelled, \\"A fight!\\" Mistaking the word \\"fight\\" for \\"fire,\\" the congregation rose en masse and started for the door. One of the ministers quickly mounted the rostrum and urged the people to keep quiet. He repeated the word \\"quiet\\" several times, and motioned to his hearers to be seated. The excited congregation mistook the word \\"quiet\\" for a second alarm of fire and again rushed for the door. Men and women crawled over benches and fought their way into the aisles, and those who had fallen were trampled upon. The screams of the women and children added to the horror of the scene. Through mere fright many persons fainted and as they fell to the floor were crushed to death. The level of the floor of the church is about from the ground, and long steps lead to the sidewalk from the lobby, just outside the main auditorium. Brick walls extend on each side of these steps for , and this proved a veritable death trap. Those who had reached the top of the steps were pushed violently forward and many fell. Before they could move others fell upon them, and in a few moments persons were piled upon each other to a height of , where they struggled vainly to extricate themselves. This wall of struggling humanity blocked the entrance, and the weight of 1,500 persons in the body of the church was pushed against it. More than twenty persons lying on the steps underneath the heap of bodies died from suffocation. Two men who were in the rear of the church when the rush began realized the seriousness of the situation and turned in a fire alarm after escaping. The Fire Department answered quickly and the arrival of the wagons served to scatter the crowd which had gathered around the front of the church. A squad of police was also hastened to the church, and with the firemen, finally succeeded in releasing the victims from their positions in the entrance. The dead bodies were quickly removed and the crowd inside finding an outlet poured out. Scores of them lost their footing in their haste and rolled down the long steps to the pavement suffering broken limbs and internal injuries.  Aftermath  In an hour, the church had been practically cleared. Down the aisles and along the outside of the pews there were dead bodies of men and women, and there were still many injured people among the bodies. The work of removing the bodies was begun at once. The church in which the convention was held is located just on the edge of the South Highlands, a then-fashionable residential section of Birmingham, and physicians living in that part of the town went to the aid of the injured. At least fifteen of those brought out injured died before they could be moved from the ground. Most of the dead were women, and the physicians said in many cases they fainted and died from suffocation. Little or no blood was seen on any of the victims. They were either crushed or were suffocated to death. Booker T. Washington was quoted after the disaster as saying, \\"I had just finished delivering my lecture on 'Industry' and the singing had commenced when some woman back of me was heard to scream. A member of the choir yelled, 'Quiet!' which the gallery understood to be 'Fire.' This was repeated and started the stampede. I found on investigation that a Birmingham man had stepped on the toes of a delegate from Baltimore named BALLOU. BALLOU resented it and made a motion as if to draw a gun. This caused the woman to scream.\\" Local relief efforts were led by banker William R.

LO conducted an analysis of the Occitan situation. They opposed the separatist views of the Occitan Nationalist Party. Instead, their core beliefs were: * The existence of an Occitan identity that was culturally and linguistically different from that of the French identity. The group was resistant to French cultural hegemony and acculturation. * Capitalist and colonial exploitation was present in Occitania, pursuing the liquidation of the Occitan national minority. * The French state increasingly oppresses the Occitan lower classes. * The class struggle in Occitania reflects greater aspirations than those of the rest of the French hexagon.

Azuike also joined Radio Netherlands Worldwide in 2008 as a trainee, part-time radio journalist, cutting his teeth on a daily news programme and subsequently a weekly magazine programme called Bridges With Africa. Frustrated by what he felt was the unbalanced and often ‚Äúinaccurate portrayal of Africa in Western media‚Äù, Azuike persuaded RNW to let him create a satirical video blog about African news, views and people, a concept inspired by US satirical news shows such as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. What‚Äôs Up Africa was the result - a YouTube video blog launched by Azuike in conjunction with RNW in March 2011 covering African news and political satire. In 2013, Azuike was invited to speak at a variety of TEDx events, the first was TEDxLuanda, based in Angola. Another TEDx events, include TEDxEuston, where he spoke on the same stage as the Nigerian Finance Minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. In 2014, Azuike was also invited to host the live TEDxHague Academy event at the Peace Palace in The Hague. In January 2012, Azuike was recognised by TheRoot.com as one of the top 25 bloggers to watch. And he was also cited as one of the 100 Most Influential Africans 2014 by New African magazine From January 2015, What‚Äôs Up Africa will be incorporated as a weekly segment within the BBC World News television show, Focus on Africa. In July 2019, his Dutch programme ‚ÄúPlaneet Nigeria‚Äù started on the Dutch public broadcaster, in which he tries to understand his country of birth.https://pers.bnnvara.nl/comedian-en-youtuber-ikenna-azuike-laat-een- ander-afrika-zien-in-planeet-nigeria/ References Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Nigerian lawyers Category:British lawyers Category:People from Lagos Category:British broadcasters Category:Nigerian broadcasters Category:British satirists Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Alumni of the University of Nottingham Category:People associated with Shearman & Sterling ","title":"Ikenna Azuike"},{"id":"44963607","text":"James Farley, (January 8, 1882 ‚Äì October 12, 1947) was an American character actor of the silent and sound film eras.

The elected individual serves on a regional council and a constituent municipal government within that region. It differs from indirect election in that in a double direct election an individual is automatically elected to two political positions, whereas in an indirect election, candidates in a municipal election must state the intention to also serve on regional council before that election. The double direct election protocol is slightly different in the case of Bowen Isand, an Island Municipality within the Islands Trust in BC. There are two ballots, one for municipal council, the other for Islands Trust. Candidates that choose to run for both offices declare that intent. The two candidates receiving the highest number of votes for Islands Trust are elected to that body, but only if they are also successful as candidates for the municipal council. Ontario In Ontario, municipalities have legislative authority to define the number of councillors representing its council. The council of a regional municipality, a geopolitical planning body consisting of multiple municipalities, determines the number of councillors that will represent the regional municipality, and the number of councillors from each of its constituent municipalities. For many multi-tier Ontario municipalities, individuals are elected as representatives for two tiers of government in one election. In other upper tier councils, a mixed system is used by which some representatives are directly elected, and others become councillors by virtue of having been elected to a lower-tier municipal council as a mayor, reeve, or other council position. In the past, this was the most common system used for electing representatives to upper-tier councils in Ontario. It was in use for the election of councillors to the Metropolitan Toronto city council until 1985, when the city switched to using direct election of councillors. In the Regional Municipality of York, members of York Regional Council consist of a subset of individuals from those elected to office in each of the nine constituent municipalities (Aurora, East Gwillimbury, Georgina, King, Newmarket, Markham, Richmond Hill, Vaughan, and Whitchurch-Stouffville). These include the mayor of each municipality, and an additional eleven regional councillors from the more populous municipalities‚Äîfour from Markham, three from Vaughan, two from Richmond Hill and one each from Georgina and Newmarket, who are elected via double direct election. In 1997, the Government of Ontario passed the \\"Regional Municipality of Waterloo Amendment Act, 1997\\", enabling the seven municipalities in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo to elect individuals to both municipal council and Waterloo Regional Council for the 1997 municipal elections. (The city of Kitchener implemented the change for the 2000 municipal election.) In 2013, the city of St. Catharines considered a change in governance to a double-direct model, in which councillors elected to St. Catharines City Council would also automatically become councillors on Niagara Regional Council, the council for the Regional Municipality of Niagara. It deferred the decision until 2015. The Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce states that this will create a \\"more coordinated, efficient and representative public administration\\". Among councils fully or partially elected by double direct election are Durham Regional Council, Peel Regional Council, York Regional Council, and the councils for the Regional Municipality of Halton and the District Municipality of Muskoka. British Columbia In British Columbia, the electorate of Saanich and Victoria elect councillors who serve municipal council and a regional district council (both for the Capital Regional District). The municipality of Bowen Island elects two councillors to both municipal council and the Islands Trust council during municipal elections. One of those double-direct elected Islands Trustees could be the mayor of the municipality. Review In the paper Regional Peculiarities of the Municipal Reform in the Period of Transition, the authors state that double direct election results in a parochial council less interested in regional matters, as most \\"try to extract as much as they can for their lower tier municipality\\", and that the upper tier council is less accountable to the electorate. If the electorate is discontented with a representative's performance at the local or municipal level, but happy with performance at other level, it cannot retain that councillor at one level but not the other. The authors also state that councils elected by direct election tend to be more progressive, and that they provide for stronger communication between municipal councils and regional councils, as representatives of the latter are also members of the former. The authors of Representation on Municipal Councils in Ontario from Brock University state that double direct election presents legal and ethical issues because members must act in the best interest of the regional council for regional matters, but must also address local matters relevant to the lower-tier municipal council.

Early life Wish-Ken-O was born 14 October 1888 at Mayetta, Kansas to John (1859 - 1901) and Mary Ann (Mnis-no-quah) (14 October 1868 - 1927-1937) Wish-ke-no and was raised with her siblings [Mabel Wishkeno Negohnsoht(aka Negonsett) (Pe-yaht-wat-moquah) (1884), N-wah-gah-quah Wishkeno (1887 ‚Äì 1892/93), female Wishkeno (January, 1890 \\\\- 1891-1892) Arthur Wishkeno (Sa-sa-wash-kuck or Kah-sah-wash-kuck) (March, 1892 ‚Äì 13 May 1978), Non-ish-quah Wishkeno (born 1893 - 1895/96), Wab-sai Wishkeno (1896 - 1903) and William \\"Willie\\" Wishkeno (Chock-tuck) (May 1899 - 23 April 1988) in the Mayetta community. She attended the Haskell Institute in Lawrence, Kansas, where she learned to speak English and write. At the time period, Haskell was an industrial boarding school, where students learned domestic skills and were punished if they spoke their native tongue. The allotment of the Prairie Potawatomi began in 1887 and was not completed until around 1905 due to fierce opposition by the tribe. Minnie and her siblings were all original allottees and heirs of their father's allotment, as he died during the time period when allotments were being settled. Life on the reservation was fairly typical of a rural farming environment, as was described by John Henry Hauberg, Sr. an attorney, businessman and noted local historian from Rock Island, Illinois. Hauberg had a relationship with Jesse KaKaQue for a number of years, taking photographs and exchanging correspondence from 1914-1918, which is housed in the Special Collections Department at Augustana College. In 1916, he visited Minnie and Jesse at her allotment, because according to custom, men lived with the wife's family after marriage and his allotment was in Oklahoma. Hauberg described a tidy farm, with all buildings in use, a typical painted farmhouse with a sitting room, bed room, kitchen, photographs on the wall and a piano. He also noted that Minnie was raising about 200 chickens and that the farm \\"was exactly like any white man's farm\\". As the years after World War I came to a close, the seeming prosperity which had existed, evaporated in the Great Depression. A false sense of Native American prosperity based on glowing reports and images of fancily costumed Indians, caused many to reject the dire need that developed for aid. In addition to the economic issues, Kansas was in the midst of a severe drought, known as the Dust Bowl. Temperatures topped 100 ¬∞F throughout the summer months of the mid-1930s, and in 1936 Kansas experienced the second hottest year on record. The reservation wells dried up, livestock had to be sold or given away as there was no way to hydrate them, gardens, which had been the main food source, withered. Kansas officials refused to provide welfare assistance to Native people, claiming inadequate funds, and federal programs to provide assistance to Indians were consistently delayed or blocked. To survive, the Prairie Potawatomi hunted, trapped and traded goods and services with each other. The occasional surplus skins or chicks or produce might be sold in Topeka for more ammunition, but most everything that was produced was used for survival. Out of these troubled times, Minnie emerged as a leader of the conservative, traditional faction. She advocated maintaining their ancient customs, rejected Christianity and forced citizenship of tribal people. She was known for being outspoken and without fear, but had the respect of many who did not agree with her because of her earnest belief in the principals for which she fought. Tribal politics By 1900 the Tribal Council had stopped regular meetings and the BIA disbanded the local agency in 1903, stopping tribal annuities in 1909. Tribal leadership was reduced to an advisory council for the Bureau of Indian Affairs though attempts were made to reinstate a traditional council. In 1917, Superintendent A. R. Snyder acknowledged that the Agency had reopened in a new location in 1913 and that headmen wished to reform a traditional council with their leader Mich-no, but Snyder discouraged them. It may be that Minnie's father served on an advisory council, but accounts that indicate he was the headman and she inherited the position from him are inaccurate. Census records confirm Snyder's statements that Shough-nas-see (Shough-nes-see) was followed by Mich-no (Mish-no). Further, Minnie was not the oldest child and Minnie' father died nearly 35 years before she came to prominence in tribal politics. Throughout the early decades of the 20th century, the Tribal Advisory Board was dominated by progressive, Christianized farmers, who validated agency decisions and were often not representative of the much larger conservative elements on the reservation. In the early part of the 1930s the conservative faction organized as a reform movement, adopted a constitution, and reorganized the Tribal Advisory Council to an elected Business Committee. Minnie first served as an appointed adviser beginning in 1933 but was elected to a lifetime position on the board of conciliators, a group composed of elder statesmen who had earned tribal respect.Stories of the Potawatomi People, p 29 When the Indian Reorganization Act was introduced in 1934, the Prairie Potawatomi rejected it. Though they desired an end of allotment and a return of some 50,000 acres of their land, they did not want an imposed self- government styled on the model of the US constitution to be forced upon them. One of the issues objected to by the Potawatomi was the rigidity of written law. Once something was written down, with a specific violation and penalty defined, it eliminated the ability for flexibility and consensus. The Potawatomi had never had a ruling body and creation of one was strongly objected to. Even worse, from the native perspective, was the oversight granted to the Secretary of the Interior or Commissioner of Indian Affairs regarding tribal governance. Bureau approval had to be obtained for all decisions regarding the tribe. Their experience with their local superintendent, who had called off-reservation meetings with progressive factions on two occasions to oust the elected conservative Business Committee, did little to inspire confidence in the New Deal Program.Clifton, pp 113-114 During the period from the 1940s to the 1960s, in which the Indian termination policy was enforced the Potawatomi continued to struggle for their own autonomy, and their own ability to deal with their affairs. One of the first pieces of legislation enacted during this period was the Kansas Act of 1940 which transferred all jurisdiction for crimes committed on or against Indians from federal jurisdiction to the State of Kansas. It did not preclude the federal government from trying native people, but it allowed the state into an area of law in which had historically belonged only to the federal government. On January 5, 1939, when House Resolution 3048 and Senate Bill 372 were introduced, lawmakers were advised that the proposal was supported by the Indian tribes. This may not have been the case with all of the tribes as both telegrams and letters indicate that correspondence between Potawatomi Business Council Chairman WahbnosahKansas Law Review, Vol 59 (2011), p. 964 and Representative W. Rogers shows the Potawatomi were objecting. The correspondence is not part of the legislative record, but instead housed in the National Archives and may or may not have been brought to the attention of the rest of the Congress. However, it is significant, as one of the letters points out, that \\"The Business Committee of the Prairie Band Potawatomi tribe of Indians represents eleven-hundred of the sixteen-hundred Indians of Kansas,\\" which means that the majority of native people were not in favor of passage.Kansas Law Review, Vol 59 (2011), p. 965 Termination attempts On 1 August 1953, the US Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 108 which called for the immediate termination of the Flathead, Klamath, Menominee, Potawatomi, and Turtle Mountain Chippewa, as well as all tribes in the states of California, New York, Florida, and Texas. Termination of a tribe meant the immediate withdrawal of all federal aid, services, and protection, as well as the end of reservations.US Statutes at Large 67:B132 A memo issued by the Department of the Interior on 21 January 1954 clarified that the reference to \\"Potawatomi\\" in the Resolution meant the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation, the Kickapoo, the Sac and Fox and the Iowa tribes in Kansas. Because jurisdiction over criminal matters had already been transferred to the State of Kansas by the passage of the Kansas Act of 1940 the government targeted the four tribes in Kansas for immediate termination. Evans spearheaded the battle against termination, calling meetings at her home and building strategies for consensus. They planned ways to raise funds taking up donations, selling livestock and other goods to get their leadership to Congressional hearings.Stories of the Potawatomi People, p 34 Tribal members sent petitions of protest to the government and multiple delegations went to testify at congressional meetings in Washington, DC. In February 1954, tribal chair Minnie Evans, along with James Wahbnosah and John Wahwassuck, testified before a joint hearing of the house and Senate Subcommittees on Indian Affairs in Washington, DC in conjunction with the neighboring Kansas Kickapoo, enabling the Kansas tribes to escape termination. Claims Commission On 13 August 1946 the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-726, ch. 959, passed. Its purpose was to settle for all time any outstanding grievances or claims the tribes might have against the U.S. for treaty breaches, unauthorized taking of land, dishonorable or unfair dealings, or inadequate compensation. Claims had to be filed within a five-year period, and most of the 370 complaints that were submitted were filed at the approach of the 5-year deadline in August, 1951. In 1946, the Potawatomi established a Tribal Council Claims Committee and Evans served as tribal chair of that committee. Ironically, the claims commission created a resurgence of \\"Indian identity.\\" Up until that time, many more progressive tribal members had moved off the reservation and increasingly worked to assimilate into the larger society, but with the potential for sharing in damages, those elements began reclaiming their Potawatomi roots.Clifton, p 112 On 16 September 1947, Evans was elected by a general council of the tribe as the tribal chairwoman.Stories of the Potawatomi People, p 29 Evans recommended that the Potawatomi hire Stone McClure Webb Johnson Oman firm from Topeka, Kansas to assist in preparing their claim. There were ten treaties in which the tribe felt terms had not been met, which required meticulous review of both title and evaluation of damages. Ultimately, there were 19 cases filed for treaty breaches and under/improper-valuations, and 2 cases filed for reclaiming attorney fees. Some of the claims involved only the Prairie Band and others involved multiple bands of Potawatomi people. For example, in one case, at issue was the amount paid to the Potawatomi for lands ceded west of the Mississippi in the removal first to Iowa and later to Kansas. In 1956, the Prairie Band of Potawatomi and its co-claimant the Citizen Band of Potawatomi Indians were awarded $3.2 million by the claims commission. An appeal was launched by a group of Potawatomi who had not relocated west claiming that they deserved part of the settlement. 16 July 1958 the appellate court ruled that the eastern group could not intervene, as the treaty for which damages were sought required the tribe to move west. A second case was heard in 1962 and an award entered for land ceded in northern Illinois and southwestern Wisconsin. It was appealed in 1965, and again in 1967, as the tribes felt that the government had not only unfairly valued the property at the time of the initial settlement, but in assessing the damages, for the undervaluation, the government had failed to take into consideration lead mines located on the tract. The appellate court agreed in 1968 and required the claims commission to revalue the award. In 1972, a review of standing for the land claims in northern Illinois and southwestern Wisconsin was held and the claims court ruled that the Potawatomi tribes did have standing to make the claim and referred it to the valuation phase.http://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v28/iccv28p454.pdf In 1978 5 remaining claim caseshttp://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v41/iccv41p508.pdfhttp://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v43/iccv43p249.pdfhttp://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v43/iccv43p308.pdfhttp://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v43/iccv43p350.pdfhttp://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v43/iccv43p476.pdf and both attorney fee cases were finally settled,http://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v43/iccv43p608.pdfhttp://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v43/iccv43p617.pdf but at least one case, and any appeals on those cases, were transferred to the US Court of Claims on 29 September 1978.http://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v43/iccv43p681.pdfhttp://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v43/iccv43p685.pdf All in all, the claims fight took nearly 32 years and was only the beginning of the turmoil that followed. Once the awards had begun to be determined, the factionalism escalated with the progressives pushing for inclusion in tribal government. The claims committee had primarily traditionalist membership with life tenure. Because of the significance of the claims proceeding, the appointed claims committee at times took on an importance that superseded the elected council.Clifton, p. 115 But Minnie was tenacious. She believed that tribal unity was important and she worked hard to understand the complexities of the situation. She attended committee hearings, court sessions, and council meetings, called unofficial meetings in her home, and refused to give in on negotiations if she felt that it would jeopardize the potential benefit to the tribe.Stories of the Potawatomi People, pp 30-34 In 1961, with much support from the area BIA office, the progressives drafted a new constitution. For a brief while in the early 1960s there were two tribal business committees and two tribal rolls. Remembering the allotment period, when individuals with dubious claims were awarded land and tribal status, the conservatives believed that only members with at least 1/4 or more Prairie Band descent could be tribal members and were in favor of restricting voting rights and office holding to only those who lived on the reservation. The progressives, on the other hand, wanted all members who had received an allotment under the Dawes Act regardless of their degree of descent to be granted membership, voting rights and the right to hold office, regardless of whether they lived on the reservation.Clifton, pp 115-116 In part, Minnie's group was spurred by the award on the first Indian Claims case, which stated that the fund was to make reparations for \\"descendants of the Nation as it existed in the Treaty of 1846.\\" Congress stipulated that the appropriation could be used as authorized by the tribal governing body with the approval of the Interior Secretary. The tribal council, elected under the rules of the 1961 constitution, declared that those who should share in the judgment were those who were listed as members of the Prairie Band as of midnight 1 December 1960. The traditionalists strongly opposed this interpretation, believing instead that the only members entitled to share in the judgement were those who were identifiable as descendants of those Potawatomi who constituted the Nation in 1846. Minnie and other traditionalists filed suit in 1963 against the tribal council but the case, which went all the way to the 10th Circuit Court determined that the tribal council had the authority to specify who was to participate in the settlement. A second action filed in 1964 against the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs was also unsuccessful in limiting those who participated in the settlement to descendants of tribal members in 1846. With the loss of the second suit, and the US government backing the legitimacy of the new tribal business council, Minnie was nudged out of tribal politics. When the claims that she had fought so hard to win were finally distributed, she was no longer a part of tribal affairs. Personal life Minnie's first husband was a great-grandson of Black Hawk, a Sauk native, named Jesse S. Kakaque (Sac name: Shah-ke-toe) (1877-1929) whom she married around 1909. Jesse had previously been married to Katie Ken-ne-que (1880 - before 1903) with whom he had one daughter, Mary Maud Kakaque (March 1898 - ?) on the Sac and Fox Reservation in Oklahoma. In 1916, he was interviewed by John Henry Hauberg, Sr. at his home on the Potawatomie reservation and married to Minnie. Jesse and Minnie had divorced by 1918. On 17 January 1919, Minnie married William F. Evans (4 March 1884 ‚Äì 16 May 1971), who was a member of the Citizens Band of Potawatomi from Oklahoma. She had three children: Emory Roy Kakaque (June, 1910 \\\\- 1910-1911), Lyman Francis Evans (28 June 1920 - 1980) and Bernice Ann Laferniar Cartwright (13 November 1922 ‚Äì 31 March 2007). Minnie died 21 October 1971 near Mayetta, Kansas and was buried in the Wishkeno Cemetery.

History According to archaeological studies conducted in the 1980s, the building was a church, built around year 1300, and was named after St. Steven. The studies base the construction year on typical construction techniques of the era. The transformation into a mosque occurred in 1479 and the object was renamed after Mehmed the Conqueror, or Fatih Sultan Mehmet. The ruins of this church-mosque feature a Dikka, a Mihrab, and the remains of a large Minaret.

Thigpen (1926 - October 29, 2013) was an American Democratic Party politician who served as the Essex County Democratic Chairman and held county and local elected offices in New Jersey. He moved on from a political scandal and corruption conviction to become a powerful political leader and elected official admired by members of both parties. Early life Thigpen was born in 1926, the son of John David Thigpen, a laborer, and Fannie Thigpen. He grew up in Rahway, New Jersey. He was a graduate of Seton Hall Prep. He excelled in track as a high school student and was the two-time national champion in the 880 yard run. He received B.S. in Business Administration from Seton Hall University, and an M.A. from St. Louis University. He was an Urban Fellow at Rutgers University. He was the national champion in the half-mile and the three-time National AAU Champion in the 1000-yard run while at Seton Hall. He is a member of the Seton Hall Prep Athletic Hall of Fame and the Seton Hall University Athletic Hall of Fame. Thigpen was vice president of Urban Data Systems Inc., a Newark-based computer forms manufacturer, from 1980 to 1987. Thigpen's political ally and cousin, Donald M. Payne, also served as the firm's vice president before his election to Congress in 1988. Thigpen also served as executive vice president of Leon N. Weiner & Associates, Inc., a Wilmington-based real estate development firm. He managed a joint venture with Campbell Soup and RCA to develop low income housing projects. Public officeholder Thigpen was appointed to the Essex County Board of Freeholders to fill a vacancy in 1987, but was not a candidate for a full term that year. He later returned as a freeholder. He also served as an East Orange city councilman. He served as the director of the Essex County Department of Planning and Economic Development. In the summer of 2009, the Democratic nominee for Essex County Register of Deeds and Mortgages, Dwight C. Brown, died after the Democratic primary at age 62. Thigpen became the Democratic nominee and defeated Republican Terriann Moore-Abrams by a 69%-28% margin. He was appointed by the governor of New Jersey to the New Jersey Health Care Administration Board. Party leader From 2004 until his death in 2013, Thigpen served as the Essex County Democratic Chairman. He succeeded Payne, who was forced to step down after new congressional rules established by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) prohibited members of congress from leading county political organizations. Thigpen served on the New Jersey Congressional Redistricting Commission in 2012. For the 2012 presidential election, he served as president of the New Jersey Electoral College, allowing him to cast New Jersey's 14 electoral votes for Barack Obama. He was a member of the Electoral College in 1996. Corruption conviction Thigpen recovered from a political scandal that occurred early in his career, while employed by the Newark Housing Authority at a salary of $14,000 per year. In 1966, he pleaded guilty to state corruption charges. He admitted to creating phony timesheets for 16 individuals not employed by the authority, cashing the checks and pocketing the money ‚Äî nearly $14,000. The funds came from a U.S. Department of Labor program that was supposed to be used for manpower training and poverty relief. Thigpen was sentenced to two years in state prison (he received a suspended sentence), five years of probation, and ordered to make full restitution. \\"I would like to say that I fully realize the seriousness of what I have done. The full impact has hit me in many ways, as well as the violation of the trust placed in me. I'm not offering any excuse, I'm heartily sorry,\\" Thigpen told the judge at sentencing. Family Thigpen was married to Ernestine Thigpen, and had three sons and four grandchildren.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2007.  History and description  Victoria Park covers an area of 27 hectares of undulating land bordered by Gregory Terrace, Bowen Bridge Road, Herston Road, Queensland University of Technology (Kelvin Grove campus) and Victoria Park Road in the suburbs of Spring Hill and Herston. Named for the reigning British monarch at the time, Queen Victoria, the park was gazetted in 1875. Victoria Park provides recreational facilities such as cricket pitches, swimming pool and golf course (redesigned with a new clubhouse in 1974). It also provides much needed parking facilities during the annual Brisbane Exhibition (Ekka) held in the adjacent Brisbane Exhibition Ground. Founding Herston was first settled by Europeans in 1859 although the area was being utilised from as early as the 1820s for major industrial activities such as brick-making and timber getting. This resulted in the denuding of the land, the sullying of the water and dispossession of the local Aborigines. Victoria Park initially spanned an area of 130 hectares. The land set aside for the park was slowly encroached upon over the succeeding years. The suburbs such as Herston, Bowen Hills and Spring Hill grew into the park, as housing development, schools, hospitals, golf courses and show grounds were permitted to be built on the park land. The site was originally utilised by the Indigenous 'Turrbal' or 'Duke of York clan' as a campground. They called this area \\"Barrambin\\". During the early colonial period, the British named it \\"York's Hollow\\".Tom Petrie's Reminiscences of Early Queensland. St Lucia, Queensland: University of Queensland Press. 1992. p. 35. . During the 1840s up to 400 Turrbal people would reside around the waterholes at York's Hollow. In 1846 police constables dispersed this major campsite killing at least 3 people, while in 1849 British soldiers of the 11th Regiment conducted another dispersal wounding several. York's Hollow was also utilised as a site for brick manufacture and by 1860 it appears that Aboriginals were no longer able to reside in the area. During the mid 1800s, Brisbane was faced with an influx of immigrants due to the New South Wales Government's immigration schemes. As a result, areas of York's Hollow (the name prior to Victoria Park) provided a settling point for various immigrant camps. The arrival of John Dunmore Lang's pioneering emigrant ship Fortitude in Brisbane in early 1849 is recognised as one of the landmark events of Queensland's history, and York's Hollow on the edge of the new township was put to good use for their accommodation. According to the Moreton Bay Courier, 253 immigrants were permitted \\"to form a temporary village on some of the slopes running parallel to the chains and waterholes in the neighbourhood of York's Hollow\\". During this time 'York's Hollow' included the area to the east of the park that is now the Brisbane Showgrounds in Bowen Hills. Many recent immigrants to Queensland in the mid-1800s stayed in these temporary camps. As Herston and the surrounding area became a popular urban development, these camps were deemed unhealthy and its residents \\"moved along\\". Several beautification projects of Victoria Park were undertaken during the late nineteenth century. This included planting avenues of trees. When Queensland separated from New South Wales in 1859, the Queensland Government made a concerted effort to provide recreational lands for the people of Brisbane, then and for the future. It was believed that the fledgling society would benefit from having open spaces included in the infrastructure. At a time when industry was choking many of the large cities in Britain and Europe, the Queensland Government did not want the same fate to befall Brisbane. Terms such as \\"lungs of the city\\" and \\"breathing space\\" were used to describe established parks in Brisbane. A Board of Trustees was created at this time to manage Victoria Park; they \\"expeditiously drew up a code of by-laws which provided, not only for the protection and good government of the park, but also laid down the rules for raising revenue for the improvement of the park\\". This revenue raising included leasing arrangements for the park. Late 1800s Victoria Park borders Spring Hill on the Gregory Terrace side at the south end of the park. This area is one of the oldest suburbs in Brisbane, and Victoria Park was seen as part of this suburb. Spring Hill was home to a cross section of Brisbane society, from the very poorest living in small cottages in the lower slopes of the hill, to the prestigious and wealthy homes overlooking Victoria Park on Gregory Terrace. By the end of the nineteenth century Spring Hill was the most populated suburb in Brisbane. Victoria Park provided an open space for residents of Spring Hill, some of whom lived in crowded and poor conditions at the bottom of the hill. In the period 1870 to 1900, Victoria Park was the largest open reserve within the immediate city area. In 1877 the Queensland Rifle Association constructed a rifle range in the north-east corner of Victoria Park. This was used both recreationally and for military and police training purposes; the range was used until 1883, when it was closed. The military, however, maintained a presence in Victoria Park, even though it was designated a \\"public park for recreation, convenience, health and amusement of the inhabitants of the City of Brisbane\\". The importance of an extensive railway system throughout Brisbane and the surrounding areas contributed to Queensland's successful development. Victoria Park played a part in this development with a line from Roma Street railway station to Sandgate being constructed through the park in 1882. The line was routed around the outskirts of the inner-city and through Victoria Park to minimise costs. This divided the park into two sections. After the railway was run through the middle of the park (1882), the park was further reduced with the building of The Hospital for Sick Children in 1883. The children's hospital was built on the Herston side of the park as the hill rose to the north. The park's land was reduced over time by the provision of sporting facilities at the south west of the park for Brisbane Grammar School, Brisbane Girls' Grammar School and St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace. At the start of the 1900s a site in the north-west of the park was considered for a new Government House; however Fernberg in Rosalie was leased for that purpose and later purchased in 1910. Early 1900s In 1913 Victoria Park played host to a globally significant scientific experiment carried out by the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The purpose of the experiment was to study the earth's magnetism, and the magnetic variation from \\"true\\" north and \\"magnetic\\" north so as to eventually gain accurate bearings. The Institute placed small stations in various locations over the earth. The Victoria Park station (a small tent) was placed on the slope below the former Children's Hospital and on the northern side of the existing busway corridor. A sandstone block denoting the exact place where the station was placed was recovered in an archaeological dig carried out in 2001. It was inscribed C.I.W. 1913. The Brisbane City Council (BCC) Substation No. 4 to the Bowen Bridge end of Victoria Park was designed in 1928 during a period of expansion in Brisbane. The building was designed by City Architect, Alfred Herbert Foster, and may be the earliest surviving unaltered substation designed by him. BCC substations were supplied with bulk energy from BCC power stations and converted it for use by consumers. The introduction of electricity to Brisbane was a slow and complex process. The first public supply of electricity was from the Barton and White generator in Edison Lane to the General Post Office in 1888. The situation was confused by the fact that within the Brisbane metropolitan area there were fourteen separate local authorities and numerous suppliers. Between 1904 and 1925 a number of rationalisations helped reduce this complexity and with the establishment in 1925 of the Brisbane City Council a single public authority was created which could plan for the provision of electrical services throughout the entire city. From 1925 there was a rapid expansion in the provision of infrastructure by the BCC for the delivery of electricity throughout Brisbane. The park was again reduced by the construction of Victoria Park Golf Club. In the 1920s, municipal golf courses were being established throughout Australia and in 1922 the Queensland Golf Association proposed to the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, William Alfred Jolly, that a municipal golf course be established in Victoria Park. In 1926 the proposal was accepted. The opportunity came after the section of Victoria Park, reserved as the intended site for the University of Queensland, was no longer required after the university acquired their St Lucia site from a generous donation of ¬£63,000 to resume over 200 acres (81 ha) by James and Emelia Mayne. The eighteen hole golf course was laid out by the surveyor Stan Francis, who was an ardent golfer. It was constructed during the Depression by men employed in the Intermittent Relief Scheme . The Victoria Park Golf Course was opened in 1931. The first Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse was designed in the Spanish Mission style by Alfred Herbert Foster and was built in 1931; it is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. View from Herston to Brisbane CBD across Victoria Park, looking south, circa 1936 Other work was undertaken during the Depression for unemployed persons including landscaping and reclamation, notably Gilchrist Avenue constructed in 1931. The Avenue caused some adjustment of the site of the golf course. It was lined with Silky Oak and Poinciana trees as part of the beautification of the park at this time. Drainage in the lower part of the park was improved to control flooding and an existing lake developed as an ornamental feature of the park. In 1936, the entrance at the corner of Bowen Bridge Road and Gregory Terrace was improved with stone piers constructed of Brisbane Tuff. World War II and afterwards During the Second World War, a number of fibrolite military buildings were constructed at various points in Victoria Park by the forces of the United States of America. Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific in late 1941, Brisbane was transformed into a locale of intense military activity with thousands of American troops stationed there before being shipped off to fight the Japanese forces in the Pacific. While most of the accommodation was canvas tents, a number of huts of fibrolite on timber stumps were constructed south of Herston Road and Gregory Terrace. After the war until 1947 many of these huts were used to house Australian war brides (Australian women who had married American servicemen). After these women married an American they became stateless, losing their Australian citizenship but unable to acquire U. S. citizenship or legal rights as several years of residence in the U.S.A was required. This left many women in a very difficult position. Housing Commission Estate, Victoria Park, October 1953 The post-war reconstruction process heralded an era of rapid population growth in Queensland, leading to an acute shortage in housing. Temporary housing became a necessity. The Queensland State Housing Commission made use of the military facilities in Victoria Park; it became the second largest temporary housing settlement in Brisbane. Each hut would house several families. By 1950 Victoria Park was the impermanent home for 460 families (usually for not more than three years). It is believed that up to 100,000 Queenslanders lived in temporary housing between 1946 and 1960; this demonstrates the importance of this period in Victoria Park's history, as well as to Queensland's social history. The temporary housing camps in Victoria Park were closed in 1960. The University of Queensland purchased several of the fibrolite military buildings immediately after the war. These were then used by the School of Medicine to house the anatomy and physiotherapy departments prior to their permanent move to St. Lucia in 1961 and 1972. The Queensland Institute of Medical Research also purchased a military building. These buildings were all vacated by 1977, and subsequently demolished. In the 1950s an extensive flowering tree planting program was initiated for the slopes and gullies of the golf course; poincianas, oleanders, jacarandas and flame trees were planted to line the fair ways. Harry Oakman, the Superintendent of Parks and Gardens was the prominent landscape architect on this project. Harry Oakman was one of the pioneers of landscape architecture in Australia. In 1945 he began a seventeen- year appointment with the Brisbane City Council as Superintendent of Parks and Gardens and became the Director of Separate Parks Branch. He was in charge of transforming many of Brisbane's parks that had been damaged by the military use during the Second World War, including Victoria Park. Oakman was recognised as a Fellow of the British and Australian Institutes of Landscale Architects and the Royal Australian Institute of Parks and Recreation. Centenary In 1959 Queensland celebrated its Centenary (100 years since Queensland was declared a separate colony (State) from New South Wales with its own local government). Victoria Park played a large role in these celebrations in Brisbane. The Centenary Pool Complex was constructed in this year by the Brisbane City Council as its principal contribution. The pool was placed at the south-west corner of Victoria Park bordering Gregory Terrrace. The complex was designed to fit into the slope of the hill over looking Victoria Park and was designed by Brisbane City Architect James Birrell. The initial design of the complex included a landscaped entrance road designed by Oakman. Another commemorative gesture was made within Victoria Park with the planting of 1000 eucalypt trees in the south east of the park. Named \\"The Gundoo Memorial Grove\\", this large area of planting was accomplished by the students of The Brisbane Girls' Grammar School as their contribution to the celebrations. The trees were provided by the Forestry Department and were nine varieties of eucalypt trees. This area of Victoria Park was in need of beautification as it had previously been the site of some of the Housing Commission buildings, recently demolished. In a memorandum from Harry Oakman he stated \\"that tree planting along forest lines in this parkland would give a unique feature to the city of Brisbane, particularly if the trees chosen are Eucalypts\\". He believed that the grove of eucalypts would have advantages such as low cost and little maintenance whilst still being attractive and shade giving. Recent history In 1968 the Department of Electricity acquired land in the south east of the park and built an office building behind the Substation. They also purchased a large stores building previously used by the Queensland Railway Department in the same corner of the park. In 1988 the lake area in Victoria Park was officially named 'York's Hollow'. The Inner City Bypass was completed in 2003. It provides a direct link from Kingsford-Smith Drive at Hamilton through to Hale Street in Paddington and from there onto the South East Freeway. The bypass sits parallel to the railway that runs through Victoria Park. It is another example of the encroachment of Victoria Park's land. The bypass was undertaken to reduce traffic congestion in the Brisbane central business district and Fortitude Valley.  Description  Victoria Park occupies undulating land which generally falls steeply from the ridge at Gregory Terrace down to the railway line, across the railway line, north to Gilchrist Avenue. The ridge offers expansive views across to the Old Museum, RNA Showgrounds (Brisbane Exhibition Ground), Royal Brisbane Hospital, University of Queensland Mayne Medical School, Victoria Park Golf Course, Red Hill, Mt Coot-tha and across to the Brisbane CBD and beyond. A pair of Brisbane Tuff entrance gate piers stand to Bowen Bridge Road. The tall stepped and tapered Brisbane Tuff piers have dressed stone bases and dado panels with quarry-faced stone corners. Decorative metal lamp holders crown the piers. The Park has large open grassed areas and is planted with mature figs, eucalypts, shade trees, ornamental trees, palms and planted beds. The Gundoo Memorial Grove of eucalypts stands to the south east end of the park. A freestanding, single-storey red face and rendered brick pavilion, former BCC Substation No. 4 stands to the corner of Gregory Terrace and Bowen Bridge Road opposite the Old Museum. The Substation addresses the corner at an angle to Bowen Bridge Road complementing that of the more prominent Old Museum to the northeast across Bowen Bridge Road. Substation, 2019 The Substation building is rectangular in plan with a timber-framed tiled hip roof behind a rendered brick parapet with a moulded cornice. The elevations are characterised by arch openings, accented keystones and rendered lintels. The front elevation is symmetrical about a projecting central entrance porch in which a decorative crest bearing the lettering BCC sits within an arched doorway. The front elevation end bays are capped by gable fronts to the parapet. The side elevations have parapets with a central gable front. A number of small metal plaques are embedded in the lower part of the front elevation, to the riser of the front concrete stair and to the front stone fence. A random course quarry- face ashlar wall of Brisbane Tuff runs to the front of the Substation from the Gregory Terrace corner and around into Bowen Bridge Road terminating in a tall capped pier. A small flight of stone stairs flanked by low piers within the wall defines an entrance from Bowen Bridge Road. The railway and inner-city bypass run directly through the park from the south west to the north east and divide the two sections of the park. This division is approximately in width throughout the park. The northern section of the park contains several sheltered barbeque and picnic areas amid large expanses of lawn and playing fields. Gilchrist Avenue has been made a cul-de-sac. A wooden and steel footbridge has been constructed over the lake from the end of Gilchrist Avenue over the lakes. The lake contains water-lilies and high grasses. At the east end of the lake is a bronze statue.  Heritage listing  Victoria Park was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2007 having satisfied the following criteria: *The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.Victoria Park is representative of important phases of Queensland's history. It was the site of an immigration camp in the mid nineteenth century. It was important during the Depression years as the setting for many government work relief schemes. It was the site of accommodation for war brides after the Second World War and also provided temporary accommodation for returned servicemen and their families.Victoria Park was the site of an important, scientific experiment in 1913. The Terrestrial Magnetism experiment was carried out worldwide by the prestigious Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington to measure the earth's magnetism. *The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.Victoria Park contains Brisbane City Council Substation No. 4, possibly the earliest surviving unaltered substation designed by architect A.H. Foster in 1928. This Substation demonstrates the way in which architectural contributions to urban design in this period were building sturdy, practical and attractive structures on a domestic scale. It is representative of the period when electricity was introduced to Brisbane and is a good example of its type. *The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.The park is an example of the works of Harry Oakman, Director of Parks for the Brisbane City Council (1948-1963) who was the first purpose-trained landscape architect to be employed by a government in Queensland. *The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.Victoria Park is significant for its aesthetic values. It is an area of landscaped parkland falling from a ridge offering expansive views in all directions. The park has large open grassed areas and is planted with mature figs, shade trees, palms and garden beds. The Gundoo Memorial Grove of eucalypts stands to the south-east end of the park. *The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.The park is a popular recreational reserve for organised sport and informal recreation. It contains many sporting facilities such as cricket pitches, tennis courts, golf course, bikeway and swimming pool.

Prior to becoming Chief Justice, he was an associate justice of the court, having been elected to the bench in 1870 after the enaction of the new state constitution. He had previously served one term in the Tennessee Senate (1851-1853), and campaigned as an elector for presidential candidate John Bell in 1860. Early life Deaderick was born in Jonesborough, Tennessee, the youngest son of David Deaderick and Margaret (Anderson) Deaderick.William S. Speer, \\"Hon. James W. Deaderick,\\" Sketches of Prominent Tennesseans (Genealogical Publishing Company, 2010; originally published in 1884), pp. 5-7. His father was a Revolutionary War veteran who had arrived in Jonesborough in 1783,Paul Fink, Jonesborough: The First Century of Tennessee's First Town (Overmountain Press, 1989), pp. 43-45. and was working as president of the local Bank of Tennessee branch when James was born. James attended East Tennessee College in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, but did not graduate from either.George W. Pickle, \\"A Tribute to the Memory of Hon. James W. Deaderick,\\" Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court of Tennessee (Marshall and Bruce, 1891), pp. 759-765. Deaderick and his wife, Adeline, moved to Cheek's Crossroads in Jefferson County, Tennessee (now part of Hamblen County) in 1833. He established a farm and opened a general store. Due in part to the Panic of 1837, his business had failed by the end of the decade.John Trotwood Moore, \\"James W. Deaderick,\\" Tennessee: The Volunteer State, 1769-1923 (S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1923), pp. 109-110. In 1841, he was appointed by President John Tyler agent to the Potawatomi tribe in Iowa. He served in this post for just a few months, however. Upon returning to Jonesborough, Deaderick studied law under Judge Seth J.W. Lucky, a local abolitionist.Walter T. Durham, \\"The Underground Railroad in Tennessee to 1865\\" (The State of State History in Tennessee series), 1 November 2008, p. 35. Accessed at the Tennessee State Library and Archives website, 19 March 2015. At one point early in his studies, he considered quitting, but continued after receiving encouragement from rising young attorney T.A.R. Nelson. He was admitted to the bar in 1844. When he showed up for his examination, Judge Lucky told him, \\"you need no examination.\\" He would practice law in Jonesborough until the Civil War. In 1851, Deaderick, an \\"ardent Henry Clay Whig,\\"\\"Communicated,\\" Jonesborough Herald and Tribune, 28 April 1887, p. 2. was elected to the Tennessee Senate seat for the district consisting of Washington, Carter, Sullivan, and Johnson counties. As chairman of the senate's Internal Improvement committee, he vigorously supported state funding for railroad construction. He served only one term. Deaderick ran for judge of Tennessee's first judicial circuit in 1854, but was defeated by David T. Patterson, 3,173 votes to 1,986.\\"Vote of the State,\\" Athens Post, 16 June 1854, p. 2.

During the sectional crisis of the late 1850s, Deaderick opposed secession. In the 1860 presidential race, he campaigned as an elector for Constitutional Union candidate John Bell, who opposed both secession and the abolition of slavery. Deaderick was a successful candidate on the Union ticket for the proposed state secession convention in February 1861, though voters rejected holding the convention.Oliver Perry Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (R.

Tennessee Supreme Court While the enaction of the 1870 state constitution restored former Confederates' right to vote, Conservatives-- a faction of moderate former Unionists and Confederate sympathizers-- were concerned that Radicals would use the Fourteenth Amendment (which barred Confederate politicians from holding office) to negate any Conservative election victories. Candidates in the August 1870 judicial elections were thus selected by Conservatives for their ability to survive Fourteenth Amendment challenges. The Conservative ticket, which consisted of Deaderick and T.A.R. Nelson for East Tennessee, Peter Turney and Alfred O. P. Nicholson from Middle Tennessee, and John L.T. Sneed and Thomas J. Freeman from West Tennessee, swept the elections.Sam Elliott, \\"The Quo Warranto Cases of 1870: When the United States Attorney Sued to Remove Half the Tennessee Supreme Court,\\" Tennessee Bar Association Journal, 31 July 2013. Retrieved: 4 January 2015. Following the death of Nicholson in 1876, Deaderick was elevated to chief justice. He ran for reelection in 1878, this time as a candidate for one of the state's two at-large seats on the bench.\\"Democratic Judicial Ticket,\\" Morristown Gazette, 24 July 1878, p. 2. While he ran on the Democratic ticket, he consistently stated his only goal was the interpretation of the law, not promoting one political view over another. He was easily reelected. Deaderick's opinions were relatively short, and generally did not cite authority. He frequently relied on his sense of justice rather than what written laws demanded. The court dealt with a wide range of issues during his tenure, including the state debt, legal issues arising from the war, family and moral issues, and issues regarding race and equality.R. Ben Brown, James W. Ely (ed.), \\"The Tennessee Supreme Court During Reconstruction and Redemption,\\" A History of the Tennessee Supreme Court (University of Tennessee Press, 2002), pp. 99-151. Arguably the biggest case of Deaderick's tenure was Lynn v. Polk (1882), which arose from a long-standing debate over how to handle the state's out-of-control debt. Republicans wanted to pay the debt in full, while Democrats were divided over the issue, with one faction arguing for a partial payment, and another arguing for full payment. With Democrats split, a Republican, Alvin Hawkins, was elected governor, and a law providing for full payment of the debt was passed. Supporters of the partial payment sued to block the law. In Lynn v. Polk, the state supreme court ruled 3-2 that the law violated the state constitution by hampering the legislature's ability to budget effectively. Deaderick was one of the two dissenters. Later life and family At the end of his second term in 1886, Deaderick retired to his home in Jonesborough. He died in 1890, and was interred in the Jonesborough City Cemetery. Deaderick and his wife, Adeline, had ten children: Arthur, Shelby, Anna, James, Frank, Wallace, Alfred, Louis, Charles, and Adeline. Deaderick's uncle, Joseph Anderson, was one of Tennessee's inaugural U.S. senators in 1796. Deaderick's wife, Adeline, was a daughter of famed Kentucky physician Ephraim McDowell, and a granddaughter of Isaac Shelby. Deaderick Street in Nashville was named for Deaderick's older brother, Michael, who worked as a banker in the city in the early 1800s. Another brother, David, was married to Eliza Crozier, the sister of Congressman John Hervey Crozier.Mary Rothrock, The French Broad-Holston County: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), pp. 409-410. Deaderick's daughter, Adeline, was married to Georgia Congressman John A. Moon.Zella Armstrong, \\"John Austin Moon,\\" The History of Hamilton County and Chattanooga, Tennessee (Overmountain Press, 1992), p. 440.

The film was released on February 1, 1918, by Paramount Pictures. The film has been preserved and it is available in various viewing formats. Plot Cast *William S. Hart as Blue Blazes Rawden *Maude George as Babette DuFresne *Robert McKim as 'Ladyfingers' Hilgard *Gertrude Claire as Mother Hilgard *Robert Gordon as Eric Hilgard *Jack Hoxie as Joe La Barge Background William S. Hart letter Hart published a letter in the Motion Picture News (March 30, 1918), titled A straight-from-the shoulder letter, advising exhibitors that he was not connected with a company called \\"W.H. Productions Co.\\". Hart claimed that the company was changing titles of his films and showing previously made features of him without his permission. The letter states that \\"the old titles under which they were previously exhibited have been changed and new titles substituted...they are old pictures with new labels\\". Hart went on to say that, \\"if your patrons...are misled by new titles into a belief that these pictures are my latest productions, it will not only injure my reputation but also seriously affect the reputation of your theatre\\". Blue Blazes Rawden is listed at the bottom of the letter, along with his other films that bear the \\"Artcraft\\" trademark. Reviews and reception A reviewer in Photoplay (1918) said that \\"Hart gives the best exhibition of his acting ability that I have ever yet seen\\". They also noted that the story \\"has no actual ending\\", but rather \\"is something of a slice of life...its interest lies in the struggle that goes on in the heart of the naturally ferocious, brutal Rawden, turned gentle by sheer determination\\". A review in Variety (1918) praised Hart saying, \\"[he] was a good actor long before he thought of going into pictures... he now reveals one more artistic accomplishment - that of an intelligent, careful, painstaking director. The detail in the preparation of the feature goes a long way toward enhancing its value\\". The Motion Picture Magazine (1918), said that \\"one celluloidic thing is as inevitable as fates and taxes-that William S. Hart starts each new picture career as a bad man and ends it by being completely reformed... like the excess tax, it is an excess reformation\\".
