Known for his \\"haunting\\" baritone voice,Mehdi Hassan profile on Encyclopedia Britannica Retrieved 31 March 2018 Mehdi Hassan is credited with bringing ghazal singing to a worldwide audience. He is unique for his melodic patterns and maintaining integrity of the ragas in an innovative way.

Retrieved 11 November 2019.  Early life  Mehdi Hassan was born on 18 July 1927 in a village called Luna (Shekhawati) (Near Mandawa) in Jhunjhunu district in British India into a family of traditional musicians. He claims to be the 16th generation of hereditary musicians hailing from the Kalawant clan of musicians. Mehdi Hassan had his musical grooming from his father Ustad Azeem Khan and uncle Ustad Ismail Khan who were both traditional Dhrupad singers. Hassan started to perform at a young age and the first concert of dhrupad and kheyal with his elder brother is reported to have been held in Fazilka Bungla, near present DC House (1935) of Undivided Punjab. His elder brother Pandit Ghulam Qadir also was very encouraging in sharpening his skills. In 1947, India became independent and its partition took place, creating a new, Muslim-majority country, Pakistan. The 20-year-old Hassan and his family migrated to Pakistan, carrying little with them by way of material goods. The family proceeded to his paternal aunt's house who lived in a village, Chak No 111/7R, near Chichawatni. They suffered severe financial hardships in their new country. Mehdi initially started working in nearby Chichawatni, in a bicycle shop Mughal Cycle House. He later became a car and diesel tractor mechanic. Despite the financial hardships, he kept up the routine of his singing practice on a daily basis and kept of practicing difficult Raags.  Singing career  In 1957, Mehdi Hassan was again given the opportunity to sing on Radio Pakistan, primarily as a thumri singer, which earned him recognition within the musical fraternity. He had a passion for Urdu poetry, and therefore, he began to experiment by singing ghazals on a part-time basis. He cites radio officers Z.A. Bukhari and Rafiq Anwar as additional influences in his progression as a ghazal singer. He first sang on Radio Pakistan in 1952. His first film song was \\"Nazar Milte Hi Dil Ki Bat Ka Charcha Na Ho Jaye\\" film Shikar in 1956. This song was written by poet Yazdani Jalandhari and its music was composed by Asghar Ali M. Husain. In 1964, his ghazal for a film Farangi, \\"Gulon mein rang bharay, baad-e-naubahar chale\\" written by renowned Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz and composed by Rasheed Attre, gave him a major breakthrough into the Pakistani film industry and he never looked back after that. Even the original ghazal poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz stopped reciting it in his 'mushairas' (poetry reciting events) and, instead, recommended that the audience ask Mehdi Hassan to sing it for them because the poet jokingly used to say that the ghazal belonged to Mehdi Hassan after its popularity. Following a severe illness in the late 1980s, Mehdi Hassan stepped down from playback singing. Later due to severity of his illness he completely departed from music. Tributes In 1977, Lata Mangeshkar was so moved by his dulcet vocals during a New Delhi concert that she‚Äôs reported to have said, ‚ÄúAisa lagta hai ke unke gale mein bhagwan boltein hain,‚Äù (It feels like God is singing through his voice). In October 2010, HMV Label released \\"Sarhadein\\" in which probably the first and last duet song Tera Milana featuring Mehdi Hassan and Lata Mangeshkar was released. This song was composed by Mehdi Hassan himself, written by Farhat Shahzad. Mehdi Hassan recorded it in Pakistan in 2009, and Lata Mangeshkar later heard the track and recorded her part in India in 2010, and the song was later mixed together for a duet. The same duet, \\"Tera Milna,\\" was also sung by Mehdi Hassan and Noor Jehan. Mehdi Hassan is regarded as one of the best singers in the sub-continent. On 18 July 2018, the day of his 91st birthday, Google featured Mehdi Hassan on its homepage doodle.Mehdi Hassan's 91st Birthday Google Homepage Doodle, Published 18 July 2018, Retrieved 11 February 2019 Death He had been suffering from a serious lung condition for a few years before his death. Mehdi Hassan died at around noon on 13 June 2012 at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi after suffering a 12-year-long tenure of lung, chest and urinary tract diseases. Towards the end of 2000, he suffered his first stroke. In 2005, he was taken to India for ayurvedic treatment where he was welcomed by A.B. Vajpayee, Dilip Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and many other of his Indian fans.

It was first screened on the weekend of Friday, 17 April 1987. With Soul Train and Video Hits no longer being produced, it is the oldest music television program currently still in production as of 2020. On Friday and Saturday nights, Rage typically starts between 11pm and 1am. The program is classified 'MA 15+' until 5am, and finishes at 12pm on Saturdays and at 7am on Sundays. Format Rage has a reputation among viewers for its minimalist format which has remained largely unchanged since the program's inception. The program was originally created by executive producer Mark FitzGerald in early 1987 under the working title \\"rage til you puke\\". This was later shortened to rage, as this was deemed more likely to be acceptable to the ABC board. It debuted in April 1987 ‚Äì the same month as MTV Australia debuted as a late night program on the Nine Network and two months after Video Hits debuted on the Ten Network. Rage was given an idiosyncratic and alternative flavour by music programmers and producers Stephanie Lewis (1988 to 1995) and Narelle Gee (1995 to 2008). Prior to 1989, Rage frequently dedicated large chunks of airtime to individual artists and musical styles, often playing an artist's entire catalogue of videos. In 1989, Saturday night specials were introduced, with Rage showing every video from a nominated artist each Saturday night in chronological order. The first artist featured was Madonna, on 6 May 1989. Other early specials included Midnight Oil, The Cult, The The, Public Image Ltd., Tears for Fears, Scrap Metal, Mental As Anything, Crowded House, Paul Kelly, The Beatles, Hoodoo Gurus, Eurythmics, INXS and Split Enz, plus heavy metal and country music specials. Guest programmers, who choose the videos aired for an episode, were introduced in January 1990 (Mark Fitzgerald and then-programmer Stephanie Lewis came up with the idea along with musician Damien Lovelock),Gee, Narelle 1998 'Rage; the songs most chosen by guest programmers', CD liner notes https://www.discogs.com/Various-Rage-The-Songs- Most-Chosen-By-Rage-Guest-Programmers/release/742435 Retrieved 2016-12-04 with ABC presenter Andrew Denton being the first guest programmer. With Saturday nights being dedicated to specials and guest programmers, Friday nights became increasingly devoted to new releases. Friday night Rage has been almost exclusively dedicated to current releases since 1995, featuring a range of music genres. The only time a host is seen on Rage delivering dialogue to the camera is when guest programmers appear on the Saturday night edition. Otherwise, the videos are run end-to-end with the occasional quick branding clip or the Rage logo accompanied by a voice that simply says \\"Rage!\\" to break them up. A \\"crawl\\" is also used at times during the program, with details of upcoming Specials and Guest Programmers printed in text at the bottom of the screen during a short snippet of a selected clip. The titling on the videos is also very simple, with the artist and song name displayed briefly after the Rage logo near the beginning of each video (originally only the artist was identified). Historically, no other logos or watermarks appear over the clip as it played, but as of 25 June 2010, Kath Earle, Executive Producer with ABC Arts & Entertainment, stated that the Director of Television and Head of Marketing have decided to watermark Rage to \\"maintain consistency across the network\\" as all other programs are watermarked. On Friday, new and recent releases are played, often including little-heard-of new names in the very early hours of Saturday morning. During his John Safran's Music Jamboree series, John Safran successfully demonstrated \\"...even a dog can get a video on Rage\\", by attaching a video camera to a dog, and editing the resulting footage together with simply produced looping music. On Saturday nights, Rage features specials and often has guest programmers, including local and international personalities from the music industry. From 1988, Rage aired the Australian Top 50 music chart on Saturday and Sunday mornings, however in mid-2006 this practice ceased and it now shows selected hits, new release video clips and a one-hour guest programming/special programming slot on Saturday morning, with new release and classic videos on Sunday morning. Between July 1993 and early 1995, Rage aired a separate \\"new releases\\" program weekly from 2am until 4am on a Friday morning. The Saturday night editions are themed. Often it's a simple dedication to an established artist by showing a large amount of their work. As an example of the other types of themes, in early 2004 edited highlights from Countdown (from the 1970s and '80s), Rock Arena (from the '80s) and Recovery (from the '90s) were shown over many weeks. The tradition continues, with January each year being \\"Retro Month\\", and now including material from other ABC shows including GTK (1970s), Flashez (1970s) and Beatbox (1980s). The first two music videos shown on Rage were \\"Weirdo Libido\\" by the Lime Spiders and \\"(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party)\\" by The Beastie Boys. From late 2015, 'vault' episodes of Rage air on Monday nights on ABC, where older music videos are shown. These episodes are focused around a theme, such as a particular artist or record label, or playing music videos from a specific year or genre. Because the show usually starts on one day and ends on the next, it is often unclear which day the show belongs to. The producers have decided that even if it begins after midnight, its identity belongs to the earlier day (Friday or Saturday) even though the majority of the show (if not all) will be on the later day. This is most likely because television guides in Australia start and end each day at 6am. Top Fifty / Broadcasts on other ABC TV channels Prior to 2006, from around 5am or 6am to 9am on Saturday mornings and 4am to the end of show on Sundays, Rage would switch to the weekly Top Fifty from the ARIA singles chart. Rage aired the Top 60 chart from 1 September 1990 to 9 March 1991, and from 8 June 1991 to 6 March 1994. If a video from the Top Fifty was unavailable, unsuitable or non- existent, it would be replaced by a splash screen of the Rage logo with the position attained in the charts for the week, the artist's name and the track's title. Also, the videos shown until 6am were uncensored (after this, the rating was set back to G-rated material). However, some clips were unavailable in that form, particularly due to heavier restrictions on clips which originated in the United States. Sometimes, two different video clips for the same song were shown in the one session. When this happens, it was often a live (or sometimes remixed) version that was shown earlier in the night/morning, while the \\"mainstream\\" censored version shown after 6am was shown in the Top Fifty due to classification laws in Australia which prevented adult-oriented material being shown in the after-6am time-slot. Since 2005, Rage is classified PG when it carries over after 6am. Rage has previously had to censor and remove videos which have breached advertorial and editorial guidelines for ABC TV. For example, in 1991, Adidas logos were blurred out in a music video by New Kids on the Block and in 2005 a music video by the Bratz Rock Angelz was removed due to its advertorial content. Post-2000, Rage is more liberal and lenient with censorship compared to how it was in the 1990s. For example, Rage, by their own discretion, opted to broadcast the Crazy Frog music video \\"Axel F\\" uncensored, showing the exposed penis of the frog, deeming it to be non-offensive. From 2005, the Top Fifty was added to the then-new digital channel ABC2's programming schedule as well from 8am to 11am. The Top Fifty is also broadcast to Asia on Australia Plus and its predecessors Australia Network and Australia Plus since the 2000s and has a large cult audience in Asian countries due to the prevalence of pop music there. It shows new release pop music videos. The weekend of 22 and 23 July 2006 was Rages last broadcast of the Top Fifty countdown. In its place at 10am to 11am on Saturday mornings is a preview of the upcoming guest programmer or special. Rage programming on Sunday mornings includes a mix of new and hit songs. The decision to remove the Top Fifty countdown was made by ABC management, not Rage production staff, and was soundly criticised by Rage's viewing audience, which flooded the program's official message boards with complaints. The cessation of the Top Fifty countdown was due to ARIA initiating a commercial association with a telecommunications company; as the commercialism breached ABC guidelines, the Top Fifty could therefore not continue to be shown by Rage. In 2008 and 2009, Rage broadcast an assortment of clips on ABC2 on Saturday afternoons. In 2011, rage on 3 is top video clips of the week as voted by the ABC ME audience to complement Stay Tuned. Since 2012, shorter broadcasts have aired transiently overnight during the week. Regular nightly airings of Rage for an hour on ABC ME started in July 2014, airing as the last program of the day. Since Saturday 21 March 2015 new segment \\"The Chart\\" counts down 20 of the most popular videos from the ARIA Singles Chart. The segment also include chart predictions and appearances from some of the most popular acts of today. The Chart airs weekly on Rage from 6‚Äì8am Saturdays on ABC, and is repeated on Sundays at 9.30pm on ABC ME. Guest programmers Rage have had many bands and artists host the show on Saturday nights. They select and introduce their favourite music videos of all time. This gives an insight into the bands' and artists' influences which are highly regarded by fans. Tapings of Rage guest programmers are not only valuable but highly sought after. Tex Perkins and Bernard Fanning are the most frequent guest programmers with five appearances on the Rage couch apiece. The most frequently chosen videos by guest programmers include Joy Division's Love Will Tear Us Apart, The Saints' (I'm) Stranded, Peter Gabriel's Sledgehammer and Aphex Twin's Windowlicker. Simulcast From New Year's Eve 1992, Triple J had simulcast Rage from 1am until 6am. This ended in 2003 when Triple J introduced their new dance show The Club in the same timeslot. Considering televisions are increasingly stereo as opposed to older mono sets, the simulcast's advantage is now moot. Digital television was also becoming popular, and digital television broadcasts can not be precisely synchronised with FM radio transmissions. Theme song The theme song used to open the show is sampled from Iggy Pop's extended version of \\"Real Wild Child\\", with Pop's vocals and the word Rage manipulated backwards throughout. Visual images for the theme include footage from Iggy Pop's \\"Real Wild Child\\" and Johnny O'Keefe's \\"Shout\\" video clips. The song used during the closing credits of the show is an extended remix of \\"Speed Your Love to Me\\" by Simple Minds, with visual image footage borrowed from \\"Speed Your Love To Me\\", \\"Sanctify Yourself\\" and \\"Waterfront\\". \\"Sleepless\\" by King Crimson has also been used as the theme song. Several years ago, a third theme was produced (also based on Iggy Pop's \\"Real Wild Child\\") to break up the guest programmer or specials clips on Saturday nights (except on Saturday mornings with hits and new releases). In the last few years, the show has been using another theme specifically for the Top Fifty, sampled from the song \\"She Said\\" by now- defunct Brisbane band Lavish. It is now used instead of the opening theme to begin the Top Fifty and replace any missing clips. During TISM's appearance on the show, they described the traditional theme song as \\"...new and exciting...\\" and its repetition as \\"always stimulating ... Why see different songs when you can see this one four or five times?\\" Yearly specials Up until 2009 for the last weekend of each year, Rage had two specials. On the Friday night, a selection of the preceding year's Best Of videos was played. On the Saturday night, they have a selection of the year's Guest Programmers. This show started with a series of Guest Programmers introductions that were shown at the beginning of each of their shows and included them introducing a few of the videos they selected during their program, followed by one or two of their videos. In 2009, Rage launched the rage 50; a count down of the top 50 clips of the year, as voted by Rage viewers. On New Year's Eve 1999, ABC celebrated the Millennium by broadcasting the 28-hour one-off television program 2000 Today. Due to this, Rage had a rare night off air. When the program finished at midnight on New Years Day, Rage was the first program on air. On Sunday 31 December 2006, Rage had a New Year's Eve special starting from midnight and going until 4:30am. It played all the greatest party songs, to bring in the new year. For the first weekend of each year, the Top 50 timeslot on Rage is used for the Top 50 songs of the previous year. This will no longer be the case from 2007 (for the Top 50 songs of 2006). Rage usually broadcasts music videos of songs from the Triple J Hottest 100 over two nights, several weeks after the Hottest 100 broadcast in late January each year (usually sometime during March). At the end of 2007, the ABC's satirical comedy group The Chaser hosted a New Year's Eve edition of Rage, the event being dubbed \\"The Chaser's War on Rage\\". Rage New Year's Eve Special is shown on the ABC main channel following the ABC's New Year's Eve programming. In 2012, Rage's Silver Jubilee, guest host Tex Perkins played featured videos of bands and artists that had been on past Rage programs. Anniversary specials =Tenth Anniversary special= On 19 April 1997, a special episode was aired to celebrate Rages tenth anniversary. It included a selection, by year, of some of the clips that had aired on Rage in the past ten years. It also included some footage of Guest Programmers from over the years. It was repeated later that year on 20 December. =Twentieth Anniversary special= Rages 20th anniversary occurred during April 2007. Each Saturday night, they played videos from an era in Rages history as well as immortals (clips that were not around during the particular years but which were important and influential videos) some of which were introduced by Guest programmers. Each week was introduced by some special footage and ended with a Star Wars-style crawl saying which years would be featured the next week (except obviously the last week in which the crawl thanked everyone), and then an exploding birthday cake. It also featured stock footage of each year featured, summarising that year. It also featured a special theme song. The following is a breakdown of what was shown week by week: ‚Äì * Week 1 (7 April) ** Tex Perkins, the only man to Guest Program Rage four times introduces the special ** clips from 1987 to 1991 * Week 2 (14 April) ** The \\"Godfather\\" of Rage (its original Executive Producer Mark Fitzgerald) explains how the show got started and explains the theme song. Stephanie Lewis who began the Rage Saturday night specials and the Rage guest programmers when she produced Rage, is also interviewed about the early days of the program ** Clips from 1992 to 1996 * Week 3 (21 April) ** Current Series Producer and Head Programmer Narelle Gee explains \\"a week at Rage\\" ** clips from 1997 to 2001 * Week 4 (28 April) ** The new Rage website is shown (as of 7 October 2007 is up and running) and the original one, which uses Shockwave is explained ** clips from 2002 to 2006 ** this week also featured celebrities and festival goers throughout endorsing Rage and wishing it a happy birthday. =Thirtieth Anniversary special= Rages 30th anniversary occurred during April 2017. The nation celebrated with a week of programming including two specially produced documentaries which explored the Australian experience of watching the show. The first celebrated the history of Rage and explored its influence on Australian music and culture. The program featured a plethora of musical talent and songs from across the decades, musicians whose work has been a mainstay of Rage but who were also viewers themselves. The second, Songs from the Red Couch: 30 Years of Guests Rage Programmers, delved into the archives to relive some classic moments from the studio. Out of the thousands of songs programmed by their guests over the years a few have been chosen multiple times. Real Wild Child book A Rage book was released in October 2010 by ABC Books/HarperCollins Australia. The author is Narelle Gee and the book is titled Real Wild Child: An Insider's Tales from the Rage Couch. The book gives an insight behind the scenes of Rage and tells the stories of the Rage guest programmers. The back cover description poses the question, What happens when the world's biggest musical acts sit down on Australia's most famous couch? Australian Rolling Stone magazine reviewed Real Wild Child with this description: Rage's long-time producer recounts the humorous, often slapstick events of a rage taping. She's a close observer of her subjects and she conveys almost a hundred sketches of what rock stars are like when their guard drops. CD and DVD releases Rage has released two double compilation albums, composed of songs that are popular with the programmers. A series of Rage music video DVDs have been released, including \\"The Chosen Ones\\", \\"Rage Gets Animated\\", \\"Most Chosen\\", \\"Rage In Love\\", \\"Retro Rage\\", \\"The Epic 90s\\", \\"Rage Adults Only\\", and \\"Rage Let's Dance\\". Some of these have been combined CD/DVD sets. A 3-disc 30th anniversary compilation was released in 2017. Critical reception In 2016, Junkee listed Rage at #35 in its list of the 60 greatest Australian television shows of all time. The website described Rage as an icon for Australian music fans and commended the ABC's decision to not alter the program from its original format despite it being on air for several decades.Welsh, Caitlin (11 July 2016) #35: Rage, The 60 Greatest Australian TV Shows of all time, Junkee, Junkee Media. Retrieved 6 August 2019. In 2019, TV Week listed Rage at #97 in its list of the 101 greatest Australian television shows of all time, which appeared in its monthly TV Week Close Up publication. The magazine said the show has been the \\"go-to\\" for any music lover since its inception, and that while rival programs have run their course, Rage is still going strong.Burfitt, John; Cullen, Tamara; Hadley, Amy; Hockey, Maddison; Mitchell, Thomas; Recchi, Karina; Vnuk, Helen; Wang, Cynthia; Zubeidi, Zara (July 2019), 101 Greatest Aussie TV Shows of All Time, TV Week Close Up, Bauer Media Group.

In 2006 it was restored and re-released on DVD in the United States by AnimEigo. Shogun Assassin was edited and compiled from the first two films in the Lone Wolf and Cub series, using 12 minutes of the first film, Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance (Kozure ≈åkami: Kowokashi udekashi tsukamatsuru or Wolf with Child in Tow: Child and Expertise for Rent), and most of Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart at the River Styx (Kozure ≈åkami: Sanzu no kawa no ubaguruma or Wolf with Child in Tow: Perambulator of the River of Sanzu). Both were originally released in 1972. There were six films in all in the series. These, in turn, were based on the long-running 1970s manga series Lone Wolf and Cub created by the writer Kazuo Koike and the artist Goseki Kojima. The project was directed by Robert Houston and his partner David Weisman, a prot√©g√© of Andy Warhol and director of Ciao! Manhattan (1972). A fan of the original Kozure ≈åkami films, Weisman had obtained the rights for $50,000 from the American office of Toho Studios. The film was distributed by Roger Corman's New World Pictures to the grindhouse movie circuit in the United States, and then later as a video cassette from MCA/Universal Home Video. When released in the United Kingdom by the Vipco video tape label in 1983, Shogun Assassin's extreme violence almost caused it to be banned in the UK by the Home Office. Vipco played this for publicity in the cover art of their 2000 release on DVD, which was stamped \\"Banned since 1983!‚Äù The poster and title treatment was created by artist Jim Evans. Jim‚Äôs son Gibran Evans voiced the narrative as Daigor≈ç. The title character, Ogami Itt≈ç, is played by Tomisaburo Wakayama, brother of the producer, Shintaro Katsu, who is known for playing Zatoichi in a series of 26 films starting in the 1960s. As a result, it has garnered a cult following. Plot As the opening credits roll, an abbreviated version of Ogami Itt≈ç's (Tomisabur√¥ Wakayama) past as Shogunate Decapitator and his wife's murder by ninja are seen, with Daigor≈ç (Akihiro Tomikawa) providing the narration. Two hooded samurai attack Ogami while he is pushing a cart with Daigor≈ç inside. Ogami fends off the attack of the first, breaking the samurai's sword and splitting his head. The second attacker jumps over the first, with the first still clasping Ogami's blade. Ogami pulls off a handrail from the cart and a blade shoots out, transforming it into a spear that impale the second attackers. As the first is dying, he reminds Ogami that he is marked for death. As Ogami and Daigor≈ç sit by a roadside fire and eat their evening meal, Ogami remembers how he offered the infant Daigor≈ç the life‚Äìdeath choice: either Ogami's sword (which would mean that Daigor≈ç would join him on his mission of vengeance against the Shogun) or Daigor≈ç's ball (which would mean that Daigor≈ç would be killed so that he could be with his mother in heaven). Daigor≈ç chooses the sword. The next day, the Shogun's officials bring Ogami the Shogun's orders: either swear eternal loyalty or commit seppuku with Daigor≈ç. Ogami chooses to fight his way to freedom with Daigor≈ç, only to have his path blocked by the Shogun and his men. The Shogun challenges Ogami to fight his son Kurando in a duel; if Ogami wins, he wins his freedom. Ogami accepts. Despite Kurando's having the strategic advantage of having the sun behind him and Daigor≈ç riding on Ogami's back, a mirror bound on Daigor≈ç's forehead reflects the sun into Kurando's eyes, blinding him long enough for Ogami to slice off Kurando's head. Ogami and Daigor≈ç journey on, never stopping in one place for very long as the Shogun's ninjas are always following them. As they wander, Daigor≈ç recalls how the Shogun's other son Lord Bizen (Taketoshi Nait√¥) and his men were given orders to kill him. Even though Bizen's men are wearing chain mail beneath their robes, Ogami's skill and blade are too powerful. Ogami lures Lord Bizen into the middle of a stream and uses an underwater sword-slash technique to kill him. Ogami sees the Shogun watching from a distance and he swears to the Shogun that he will destroy him and all of his ninjas. The Supreme Ninja (Kayo Matsuo) receives orders from the Shogun to kill Ogami and Daigor≈ç. Lord Kurogawa (Akiji Kobayashi) doesn't believe the Supreme Ninja's women are up to the task, so she proves otherwise by having her ninjas to kill Kurogawa's strongest ninja Junai. Ogami and Daigor≈ç meet secretly with a client to discuss an assassination request. Ogami is asked to kill Lord Kiru (the Shogun's brother), and in return he will receive a thousand pieces of gold. Ogami accepts the mission and is told that Lord Kiru is being escorted by a three- brother team known as the 'Masters of Death.' During Ogami and Daigor≈ç's journey, they are attacked several times by The Supreme Ninja's women, but Ogami kills them each time. Ogami finally faces the Supreme Ninja herself. She attacks Ogami with a weighted net that contains fishhooks, but Ogami cuts himself free and the Supreme Ninja flees by running away backward. Ogami and Daigor≈ç keep on traveling, but they now come face-to-face with Lord Kurogawa's entire ninja force. Pushing Daigor≈ç in his cart to safety, Ogami uses the spear blades in the cart's handrails to attack. All but two of the ninja are cut down, but Ogami is left wounded. He manages to push Daigor≈ç to the safety of a deserted hut before collapsing from loss of blood. Daigor≈ç goes in search of water for his father, finally bringing it back in his mouth, then takes some food offerings from a roadside shrine, leaving his jacket in honorable exchange. The Supreme Ninja meets with Lord Kurogawa to report her failure, but Lord Kurogawa has another plan: to strike at Ogami through Daigor≈ç. Later that night, Daigor≈ç is lured outside the hut by the sound of a woman singing. Waking up to find Daigor≈ç gone, Ogami searches for his son. He finds Daigor≈ç is a prisoner of Lord Kurogawa and the Supreme Ninja. Daigor≈ç is tied up and suspended over a deep well; Kurogawa demands that Ogami surrender or he will drop Daigor≈ç down the well. Ogami refuses, so Kurogawa and his men attack. Kurogawa lets go of the rope suspending Daigor≈ç over the well, but Ogami manages to stamp his foot down on the rope and kill Kurogawa (and his two ninjas) at the same time. Ignoring the Supreme Ninja, who has not moved throughout the fight, Ogami carefully pulls Daigor≈ç, who has survived, up to safety. Instead of killing the Supreme Ninja, Ogami walks away with Daigor≈ç. Ogami and Daigor≈ç board a ship which is carrying the 'Masters of Death' to their rendezvous with Lord Kiru. Also on board is the Supreme Ninja. Rebels attack the 'Masters of Death', but are easily dispatched. During the night, the remaining rebel starts a fire on board the ship. In the ensuing inferno, the 'Masters of Death' tell Ogami that they recognize him but that they will not attack him as long as he makes no move against them, and they leave him. The companionway is blocked by flames, so he cuts through the deck planking. Ogami then puts Daigor≈ç in his cart and throws them both overboard to safety before pole-vaulting himself into the sea. The Supreme Ninja attacks Ogami from underwater but he overpowers her. Getting Daigor≈ç, himself and the Supreme Ninja to shore and to the shelter of a fisherman's hut, he strips all three of them naked and gathers them close together, telling the Supreme Ninja that they must share their body heat or die. The Supreme Ninja doesn't understand why he would save her and realizes she cannot kill Ogami or his son. The next day, Ogami and Daigor≈ç leave her there, knowing that she will have to return to the Shogun, report her failure and commit suicide. The 'Masters of Death' escort Lord Kiru and his entourage through a desert of sand dunes, where they are attacked by a rebel force concealed under the sand. The 'Masters of Death' then fight off and kill all of the rebels, and Lord Kiru is taken to safety. However, they haven't gone far before they see Daigor≈ç standing in their way. He points to Ogami, who is waiting. The 'Masters of Death' finally face off against Ogami, but one by one they are cut down and killed. Ogami then chases after Lord Kiru's procession, killing and driving off the guards. Lord Kiru protests that he is the Shogun's brother, but Ogami tells Kiru that the \\"Shogun means nothing\\" to him. Ogami then cuts Lord Kiru down. As he and his father walk away from the carnage, Daigor≈ç looks back one last time and says via voice-over, \\"I guess I wish it was different ... but a wish is only a wish\\". The final shot is a freeze-frame close-up of Daigor≈ç's face looking back. Cast * Tomisabur√¥ Wakayama as Lone Wolf: The Shogun's disgraced, former executioner.

Release Shogun Assassin was released theatrically in the United States 11 November 1980 where it was distributed by New World Pictures. Shogun Assassin was released to home video by AnimEigo in 2006. Reception From contemporary reviews, Vincent Canby of The New York Times, wrote Shogun Assassin \\"is as furiously mixed up as What's Up, Tiger Lily?\\" and that outside \\"the little-boy's narration, the movie's not much fun once you've gotten the picture, which is that of a tubby, outcast samurai wandering the length and breadth of Japan, pushing an antique baby carriage that contains his tiny, remarkably observant son.\\" John Pym (Monthly Film Bulletin) found that \\"the impetus of the original director's intention seems somehow to have been turned round by having the story related from the point of view of the uncomprehending Daigor≈ç\\", whose narration he compared to that of Linda Manz's Days of Heaven). \\"What has evidently animated this American version is the packaging of ample bloodshed with the minimum of explanation. Thus, we never really learn why the samurai's wife is murdered; and such scenes as the one in which the headsman compels his son to make a fateful choice between a sword and a pretty raffia ball go for nothing.\\" The review concluded that \\"the swordplay is of a high, non-exploitative order, and what narrative elements remain-the fire of the ship, for example-are handled with admirable vigour\\". From retrospective reviews, Stuart Galbraith IV of DVD Talk said, \\"A radical reworking of not one but two Japanese movies combined into a single action- filled extravaganza, Shogun Assassin floored audiences with its dream-like, poetic action and pressure-cooker bloodletting.\\" Tim Lucas (Sight & Sound) described Houston's version as an \\"ingenious and deeply imagined reinterpretation also turns out to be a conspicuous example of a beloved grindhouse experience that was in fact rewritten, restored (by Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere and the Raiders) and disembowelled in the cutting room\\" In popular culture * Several dialogue excerpts from the film are sampled in the GZA album Liquid Swords * In Kill Bill: Volume 2, Beatrix Kiddo and her four year old daughter watch the film as a bedtime story See also * Jidaigeki * Exploitation film  References  =Footnotes= =Sources= * External links  \\"The Shogun Assassin Movies\\" 1980 films Films directed by Robert Houston Japanese films Jidaigeki films Live-action films based on manga Lone Wolf and Cub films New World Pictures films Samurai films Splatter films Films set in the Edo period ","title":"Shogun Assassin"},{"id":"992829","text":"A microcell is a cell in a mobile phone network served by a low power cellular base station (tower), covering a limited area such as a mall, a hotel, or a transportation hub. A microcell is usually larger than a picocell, though the distinction is not always clear. A microcell uses power control to limit the radius of its coverage area. Typically the range of a microcell is less than two kilometers wide, whereas standard base stations may have ranges of up to 35 kilometres (22 mi). A picocell, on the other hand, is 200 meters or less, and a femtocell is on the order of 10 meters, although AT&T; calls its femtocell that has a range of , a \\"microcell\\". AT&T; uses \\"AT&T; 3G MicroCell\\" as a trade mark and not necessarily the \\"microcell\\" technology, however. A microcellular network is a radio network composed of microcells.  Rationale  Like picocells, microcells are usually used to add network capacity in areas with very dense phone usage, such as train stations. Microcells are often deployed temporarily during sporting events and other occasions in which extra capacity is known to be needed at a specific location in advance. Cell size flexibility is a feature of 2G (and later) networks and is a significant part of how such networks have been able to improve capacity. Power controls implemented on digital networks make it easier to prevent interference from nearby cells using the same frequencies. By subdividing cells, and creating more cells to help serve high density areas, a cellular network operator can optimize the use of spectrum and ensure capacity can grow. By comparison, older analog systems have fixed limits beyond which attempts to subdivide cells simply would result in an unacceptable level of interference.  Microcell/picocell-only networks  Certain mobile phone systems, notably PHS and DECT, only provide microcellular (and Pico cellular) coverage. Microcellular systems are typically used to provide low cost mobile phone systems in high-density environments such as large cities. PHS is deployed throughout major cities in Japan as an alternative to ordinary cellular service. DECT is used by many businesses to deploy private license-free microcellular networks within large campuses where wireline phone service is less useful. DECT is also used as a private, non-networked, cordless phone system where its low power profile ensures that nearby DECT systems do not interfere with each other. A forerunner of these types of network was the CT2 cordless phone system, which provided access to a looser network (without handover), again with base stations deployed in areas where large numbers of people might need to make calls. CT2's limitations ensured the concept never took off. CT2's successor, DECT, was provided with an interworking profile, GIP so that GSM networks could make use of it for microcellular access, but in practice the success of GSM within Europe, and the ability of GSM to support microcells without using alternative technologies, meant GIP was rarely used, and DECT's use in general was limited to non-GSM private networks, including use as cordless phone systems.

DOI: 10.1075/eww.38.3.04lam The term \\"Runglish\\" was popularized in 2000 as a name for one of the languages aboard the International Space Station. Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalyov said: \\"We say jokingly that we communicate in 'Runglish,' a mixture of Russian and English languages, so that when we are short of words in one language we can use the other, because all the crew members speak both languages well.\\" NASA has since begun listing Runglish as one of the on-board languages. Although less widespread than other pidgins and creoles, such as Tok Pisin, Runglish is spoken in a number of English-Russian communities, such as in Southern Australia and most notably the Russian-speaking community of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, New York. In literature Some notable novels have foreshadowed the development of Runglish. A small subplot in Arthur C. Clarke's novel 2010: Odyssey Two concerned the crew of a Russo-American spaceship, who attempted to break down boredom with a Stamp Out Russlish!! campaign. As the story went, both crews were fully fluent in each other's languages, to the point that they found themselves crossing over languages in mid-conversation, or even simply speaking the other language even when there was no-one who had it as their native tongue present.

It has been claimed that this was in part to give support to what is seen as proper Russian against such influences as the spread of English and Runglish. Yuri Prokhorov, the head of the Russian State Institute of Foreign Languages, stated that \\"Young people always develop fashionable ways of communicating. (But) it is Russian words used incorrectly that damages the purity of the language, not the introduction of foreign words.\\" Examples = Basic borrowing of words= Whenever Russian speakers borrow an English word, they would adapt it to 33-letter Russian alphabet, sometimes altering some sounds. Therefore, whenever a word with diphthong in Russian, its diphthong gets replaced with a Russian vowel. = Borrowing English words over existing Russian ones = The following examples of the Runglish \\"lish\\" are related to Brighton Beach speak, rather than the array of borrowed words used in Russia. # Driving: –î—Ä–∞–π–≤–∏—Ç—å, Draivit (Proper Russian: –≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ –º–∞—à–∏–Ω—É/–µ—Ö–∞—Ç—å) # Case: –∫–µ–π—Å, Keis (Proper Russian: —Å–ª—É—á–∞–π) # Donuts: –î–æ–Ω–∞—Ç—ã, Donaty (Proper Russian: –ø–æ–Ω—á–∏–∫–∏) # Appointments: –ê–ø–ø–æ–π–Ω—Ç–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã, Appoyntmenty (Proper Russian: –ù–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è [–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º]) # Sliced Cheese: –ù–∞—Å–ª–∞–π—Å–∞–Ω—ã–π —á–∏–∑, Naslaysaniy chiz (Proper Russian: –ù–∞—Ä–µ–∑–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Å—ã—Ä) # To merge branches: –°–º–µ—Ä–∂–∏—Ç—å –±—Ä–∞–Ω—á–∏, Smerzhit' branchi (Proper Russian: –°–æ–≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å –≤–µ—Ç–∫–∏) # To manage: –°–º–µ–Ω–µ–¥–∂–∏—Ç—å, Smenedzhit' (Proper Russian: –°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å—Å—è) # I sent you message with attached request: –Ø –∑–∞—Å–µ–Ω–¥–∏–ª —Ç–µ–±–µ –º–µ—Å—Å–µ–¥–∂ —Å –ø—Ä–∏–∞—Ç—Ç–∞—á–µ–Ω—ã–º —Ä–µ–∫–≤–µ—Å—Ç–æ–º (Ya zasendil tebe messedzh s priattachenym rekvestom) (Proper Russian: –Ø –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª —Ç–µ–±–µ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ/—Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å –ø—Ä–∏–∫—Ä–µ–ø–ª—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–º –∑–∞–ø—Ä–æ—Å–æ–º) = Borrowing of basic words due to some specific reason = Sometimes, however, words get borrowed to indicate the specific type of the item, to avoid lengthy adjectives. In fact, sometimes, even word \\"–∫–µ–π—Å\\" or \\"–¥–æ–Ω–∞—Ç\\" can refer to something different than \\"case\\" or \\"doughnut\\": # –ö–µ–π—Å (borrowed \\"Case\\" as in \\"Briefcase\\"): refers \\"protective briefcase\\" made of aluminum (a trope in XX century); (proper Russian: \\"–ó–∞—â–∏—Ç–Ω—ã–π —á–µ–º–æ–¥–∞–Ω\\"). Reason to borrow the word: \\"Zashitnyj\\" would be mistaken for another \\"–∑–∞—â–∏—Ç–Ω—ã–π\\", the certain shade of green color. # –î–æ–Ω–∞—Ç—ã, Donaty (borrowed and shortened \\"Donations\\")(used in MMORPG slang for pay-to-win system or paid, purchaseable items). Normal Russian word \\"–≤–∑–Ω–æ—Å\\", Vznos may also mean \\"payment\\" as in pay-to-play subscription. # –¢–∞–π–º-–º–µ–Ω–µ–¥–∂–º–µ–Ω—Ç (borrowed \\"Time Management\\"): literal Russian \\"[—É–º–µ–Ω–∏–µ] —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—Ç—å –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–µ–º\\" would sound like \\"sci-fi\\"-ish \\"time manipulation\\" rather than \\"time management\\"; and \\"[—É–º–µ–Ω–∏–µ] —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ—Ä—è–∂–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–µ–º\\" would lose the implication of abilities to manage personal time. # –ï-–º—ç–π–ª (borrowed \\"E-mail\\", but as a noun for any message/address); also, \\"–º—ã–ª–æ\\" (miilo, Russian for \\"soap\\") is used as informal for \\"e-mail\\". Proper Russian would be lengthy \\"–≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ\\" or cryptic \\"–≠-–ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ\\". # –ö–∞—Ä—à–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–≥ (borrowed \\"Car Sharing [service]\\") - in Russian, direct phrase \\"–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–æ–±–∏–ª–µ–π\\" would be desinformative, since it would refer to \\"breaking apart\\" cars/\\"breaking down\\" cars/\\"sharing\\" cars/\\"dividing\\" cars/\\"time sharing\\" car use and even \\"splitting\\" cars (as if a car would be \\"shared\\" in parts between parties). # –ë—Ä–µ–∫–µ—Ç—ã (Borrowed \\"brackets\\"): refers to dental brackets for teeth correction, not brackets in general (proper Russian would be –°—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–∫–æ–±—ã). Runglish as a name for \\"Russian's flawed English\\" Another practice, misnomered as \\"Runglish\\", implies use of Russian way for constructing sentences, omitting words and employing literal translations of Russian idioms, as well as using more \\"official-sounding\\" style while speaking/writing in English. \\"Synthetic language\\" structure of Russian language may make learning English norms more difficult: while English language requires a certain order of words in a sentence, \\"synthetic\\" Russian just doesn't have such a requirememt; instead, it relies on a certain system of suffixes and endings for almost all words used instead. = Overly \\"official\\" vocabulary = Such a lish may fail to feel neutral and clear to western English speakers, since many words, widely used in Russian in day-to- day chat, can be perceived as official-styled, and may sound like a show-off attempt. * Say, alongside with \\"–ë–µ—Ä–µ—á—å –µ–¥—É\\" (\\"to save food\\") phrase, Russians would use \\"–≠–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—Ç—å –µ–¥—É\\" (to \\"economy\\" food) in same exact meaning. Such day- to-day use of \\"officially sounding\\" borrowed words instead of words native for Russian language is often called by Russians as \\"–∫–∞–Ω—Ü–µ–ª—è—Ä–∏—Ç\\" Examples of use, provided by Posmotre.li(kan-tsee-lya-rit), basically, language people from offices would \\"get infected with\\". ** Phrase \\"ration food\\", implying strict saving of food, however, won't directly translate into Russian; similar- sounding word \\"—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω\\" (rah-tsee-on) normally means \\"animal's diet\\" instead. Mixup of such words (due to influence of Continental European languages) can also be called out as \\"runglish\\". The very word \\"–∫–∞–Ω—Ü–µ–ª—è—Ä–∏—è\\" refers to accounting and office clerks who make internal reports, rather than chancellors. Therefore, \\"–∫–∞–Ω—Ü–µ–ª—è—Ä–∏—Ç\\" may be loosely translated as \\"clerk's soreness\\" or \\"clerk-itis\\" and refer to constant use of words people not working in offices (say, farmers/village dwellers wouldn't be required to ever face, but factory workers would face such words in news and slogans). = Simple tense overuse = This \\"Runglish\\" style\\" may include improper use of \\"simple\\" tenses (X did Y), rather than \\"perfect\\" one (X have done Y). * A possible difficulty to grasp the concepts of \\"perfect\\" tense is, the idea of \\"perfect\\" form of a verb is used in Russian language on occasions \\"simple\\" tenses in English cover (I did X = –Ø —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª –•); all while \\"imperfect\\" verb would be often used in situations English speaker would use \\"continuous\\" form (I was doing X = –Ø –¥–µ–ª–∞–ª –•) = Accidental misuse of idioms, different connotations = Many common words and idioms may be lost in translation in between Russian and English. A rather known anecdote of accidental, unintended idiom use is \\"Let('s) me speak from my heart in English, –õ–µ—Ü –º–∏ —Å–ø–∏–∫ —Ñ—Ä–æ–º –º–∞–π —Ö–∞—Ä—Ç –∏–Ω –∏–Ω–≥–ª–∏—à\\" phrase:see YouTube video # \\"From my heart\\" phrase may be misinterpreted as \\"by heart\\" idiom, reference to memorisation of some text \\"as is\\" to quote it; while it was supposed to refer to \\"speaking from own heart\\" idea. # \\"Let's\\" is short for \\"let us\\"; however, \\"–¥–∞–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ\\", which normally means the same in Russian, is also used as a synonym for \\"Let me\\", without 1st person plural \\"us\\". Another case of words with a similar meaning, yet different connotation is \\"–ß—Ç–æ –Ω–∞—Å—á—ë—Ç\\" beginning of a sentence, the equivalent of \\"What about\\": \\"–ß—Ç–æ –Ω–∞—Å—á—ë—Ç\\"/\\"–ö–∞–∫ –Ω–∞—Å—á—ë—Ç\\" is often used in \\"what do you think about\\" neutral sense; or \\"how about\\"'s synonym; but the \\"what about you\\" connotation, is rare for \\"–ß—Ç–æ –Ω–∞—Å—á—ë—Ç\\". Instead of \\"what about you\\", for explicit tu quoque/whataboutery connotation of \\"reverting the blame\\", Russian language utilizes \\"–°–∞–º —Ç—ã!\\" –∏–ª–∏ \\"–°–∞–º —Ç–∞–∫–æ–π!\\" phrases, which literally can be translated \\"[One]self, you\\" or \\"[One]self, such\\". * \\"–ù–∞—Å—á—ë—Ç\\", however, isn't an exact equivalent of \\"about\\", and is supposed to mean \\"on the (ac)count\\" (of something). * To be exact, a single-letter word \\"–û\\" is used for \\"about\\" in Russian; but \\"–ß—Ç–æ –æ\\"/–ß—Ç–æ –æ–±\\" beginning of a sentence is rare in Russian. * Also, for example, any software's \\"About\\" section has to be translated as \\"–û –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–µ\\" (About the program). = Common speech-related issues = Since anything similar to the diphthongs, or the silent \\"e\\" in words like \\"dice\\" or \\"prone\\" ar the are exceptionally rare in Russian words (with the exception of –¨ (soft sign) and –™ (hard sign), with the latter acting as a kind of separator inside a word); it may be challenging to learn proper pronunciation since the very idea of silencing \\"usual\\" letters may feel foreign to a person from Russia. The sounds of A/E letters and D/T letters (in such English words as \\"bat\\"/\\"bad\\"/\\"bet\\"/\\"bed\\" especially) can be confusing for a Russian not just for accent reasons, but due to bad transliteration of English words into Russian (hence causing a situation when \\"lish\\"-speaking person may get English speech unintentionally flawed): * The \\"ae\\" (the diphthong, the sound indicated with [... √Ü ...] in IPA transcriptions) can be an issue: despite there is a letter for sound, similar to √Ü (which is, as if it were \\"ae\\" in Russian accent\\", the letter –Ø); Russians tend to transliterate \\"A\\" letter, once it stands for an \\"√Ü\\"(as in \\"and\\", \\"apple\\", \\"rap\\", \\"bat\\", \\"bad\\") not as \\"–Ø\\", the said letter with sound close to the √Ü sound, not even as Russian \\"A\\" (with \\"open \\"ah\\" sound only) for the similar look, but as \\"–≠\\" letter, a letter with \\"eh\\"-like sound, despite the abundance of \\"e\\" letters with \\"eh\\", \\"—ç\\"-like sounds (\\"—ç–Ω–¥\\", \\"—ç–ø–ø–ª\\", \\"—Ä—ç–ø\\", \\"–±—ç—Ç\\", \\"–±—ç–¥\\" are the commons of transliteration) ** There is no strict \\"A with [√Ü] sound in original word ---> –≠ in the resulting word\\" rule: in words like \\"fact\\", Russian transliteration uses \\"open \\"Ah\\" (which, however, a false friend; if \\"fact\\" is used in English \\"as known\\" by a Russian, it may be misinterpreted by native English speaker as f***ed profanity). ** At least one case of transliterating \\"A\\" as \\"–Ø\\" does exist: word, which stands for \\"Singularity\\"which does have the \\"√Ü\\" sound, is spelled as \\"–°–∏–Ω–≥—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å\\". * The \\"T\\" sound in English sounds soft, compared to Russian way to say \\"T\\" (as in examples \\"Bed\\" vs \\"Bet\\" listed, letter \\"t\\" not always would be recognized). The pronunciation of the letter R varies between many languages, and Russian is no exception: in Russian it is pronounced closer to the \\"Japanese \\"R\\" sound, or \\"burst-like\\" (to English ears, with a hint of \\"D\\") as in \\"Brrr\\" onomaethopea, or \\"drilling\\" noises. Conversely, English \\"R\\" may be hard to interpret for a Russian as \\"r\\" and not a \\"v/w\\" sound.

It is the highest river in terms of elevation. Koshi river system The Kosi River, or Sapt Koshi, drains eastern up. It is known as Sapta Koshi because of the seven rivers which join together in east-central Nepal to form this river. The main rivers forming the Sapta Koshi River system are ‚Äì the Sun Koshi (‡§∏‡•Å‡§® ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∂‡•Ä)], the Indravati River (‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§§‡•Ä), the tama Koshi (‡§§‡§æ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∂‡•Ä), the Dudh Koshi (‡§¶‡•Å‡§ß ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∂‡•Ä), the Arun River (‡§Ö‡§∞‡•Å‡§£), Tamor River (‡§§‡§Æ‡•ã‡§∞) and Likhu River. The Dudh Kosi river originates from the high-altitude areas of Mount Everest (8848 metres) and the snow and glacier melt contributes significant portion of streamflow, especially during the dry season. The combined river flows through the Chatra Gorge in a southerly direction to emerge from the hills. Course The river drains the Mount Everest massif, the highest peak in the world. It begins just east of Gokyo Lakes and flows south to Namche Bazaar. Continuing south, the Dudh Koshi exits Sagarmatha National Park and passes to the west of Lukla. The Lamding Khola joins the Dudh Koshi to the southwest of Surkya and continues its southerly course to Harkapur, where it joins the Sun Kosi.  Paddling  The river is characteristic of extreme white water and normally cannot be used for watersports. The descent is over 5% and there are rapids that reach WW VI difficulty (not yet rated by AWA) and places that need to be portaged even with the best equipment. In addition, the river often changes ‚Äî big stones getting moved around by natural forces etc. Flowing down from Mount Everest, the river is believed to be the highest navigable whitewater. As such, it came to attention of teams participating in the world cup since Austrian paddlers made a world record descending from 3200 m altitude in France. Czechoslovak sportsmen then agreed to take up the challenge. A team of sixteen men, fourteen Czechs and two Slovaks, had been gathered and on January 4, 1973 they set on the journey from Dƒõhylov by cars (notably using customized Tatra 138 that had to survive over 30,000 km forth and back). For the last part from Lukla to Pheriche, 110 porters were hired to carry the boats and other equipment. The actual river trip began on April 1 near Pheriche at 4243 mamsl and ran for 126 km down to Sun Kosi. The paddlers used both covered tandem canoes (C2) of Vertex brand and solo kayaks (K1), all made of fiberglass. The expedition returned home safely in August the same year.Zapomenut√© v√Ωpravy: Expedice Dudh-Kosi Three years later, in 1976, there was a British expedition of seven kayakers under the leadership of Mike Jones. They used 4 metres long fiberglass slalom-style kayaks specially designed by Pyranha Canoes with extra buyonancy and reinforcement. The expedition is notable for taking place in September to avoid ice and when the water was high to set new altitude record. They paddled at approximately 5300 mamsl on one of the lakes at the Khumbu Glacier. But the high water flow had its downside ‚Äî many parts were too dangerous and had to be omitted; the result was that just two boats out of eleven survived to the end at the confluence with Sun Kosi. It is unclear which parts of the river were skipped, but the descent is generally considered incomplete. The next year, HTV documentary movie \\"Dudh Kosi: Relentless River of Everest\\" has been released which is a source of common misconception that this was the first trip on the river. Note that both expeditions didn't embark on Dudh Kosi but rather on Lobuche which is the river formed by the Khumbu Glacier and which runs around Pheriche. Just below Pheriche it merges with Imja Khola which then runs for about ten kilometres before it joins Dudh Kosi under Tengboche. Since then, there were many expeditions using wide variety of boat constructions allowing to run some rapids that had to be portaged previously. However the access to upper parts above Lukla is now limited due to stricter regulations in and around national parks.

The number of notions officially in use declines each year, with around 200 notions currently included in the official Notions book sent to New Men. Some of the same words are used at other schools, in particular Eton and Charterhouse (e.g. both schools use \\"div\\", though with extended meanings), though there they are not referred to as \\"notions\\". A Wykehamist may however speak (e.g.) of \\"an Eton notion\\" or \\"an Oxford notion\\" in describing the vocabulary or traditions of another institution. An example of a custom which is a notion is Morning Hills, when the whole school gets up early in the morning to meet on the top of St. Catherine's Hill, a nearby hill belonging to the college.Lawson, 1901. pp. 55‚Äì57 A personal notion is a personal right or privilege. For example, it is a \\"notion\\" of the Prefect of Hall (head boy) to be carried into class in bed. An academic notion is one with no significance except as a question to be asked at notions examinƒÅ. A bad notion is a solecism: either a non-notional mode of speech or action where a notion is expected, or an attempt at a notion that misfires. A purported notion not accepted as historically authentic may be described as spurious. Style  Some notions are created by shortening phrases ‚Äì for example, the Dons' Common Room Notice Board became Do Co Ro No Bo; other notions derive from Latin ‚Äì for example, foricas (Latin for 'lavatory') was shortened to fo. Thus a pupil might comment, \\"It's fortunate that the Do Co Ro has its own fo.\\" Abbreviations are often indicated by a colon, as in 18th-century handwriting, for example \\"Sen: Co: Prae:\\" (Senior Commoner Prefect); some end with a long vowel, indicated with a macron, for example \\"mathmƒÅ\\" and \\"examinƒÅ\\". There are slight differences of vocabulary between College (the mediaeval school \\"house\\" occupied by boys with scholarships)Lawson, 1901. pp. 24‚Äì26 and Commoners (boys not in College).Lawson, 1901. p. 27 Examples Notions include: * Bogle (sometimes spelled bogwheelFound in this form in Eric Partridge's Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English as \\"Cambridge undergraduate slang 1924-40\\".): bicycle * Div: class or formLawson, 1901. p. 121 * Don: teacher * Do Co Ro: Don's Common RoomLawson, 1901. p. 37 * Fo[ricas]: (Latin) lavatoryLawson, 1901. p. 46 * Lob: to cry (short for lobster)Lawson, 1901. p. 70 * Man: pupil (of any age)Lawson, 1901. p. 73 * Mug: to work.

That Prefects are to understand that they have no power to compel juniors to copy 'Notion- Books'. 2. That any Prefect infringing the above rule will be punished by the loss of his power.\\") A page from Winchester College Notions, by Three Beetleites, 1901 Old examples, now in Wiccamica Room, include: *R. Gordon, Winchester College Notions Book (1842), *F. Fane, Winchester College Commoner Word Book (1843) *Thomson, Winchester College Commoner Word Book (c 1855) *J. A. Fort, Winchester College Commoner Word Book (1874) *A. L. Royds, Winchester College Commoner Word Book (1867) *Cripps, Winchester College Commoner Word Book (1868‚Äì72) Printed versions are Wrench's Word Book and Three Beetleites: see Sources. The latter of these was long considered authoritative in Commoners. The fullest College notions book is that by Stevens (Sources). This book is unusual in that it reflects the usages of the 1920s, when the author was at school, but appears to have been continually revised by the author from a scholarly point of view and typed out in the 1960s. It was edited by Christopher Stray and printed in 1998. Other manuscript books are those of Steadman (1955), Foster (c. 1969), Tabbush (1973‚Äì4) and Gay (1974). These were generally kept by whatever senior man was most interested in notions, and circulated shortly before Notions ExaminƒÅ in each year. In the late 1980s this was formalized, and the custodian was known as \\"Keeper of the Notions and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sutton Scotney\\". A slim brochure, containing only the most basic notions in common use, is printed by P & G Wells and distributed to new men. In earlier times these were available for sale, but were confined to Commoner notions (as recorded in Three Beetleites) and never seen in College. Notions tests Notions examinƒÅ, or latterly just Notions (always plural), used to be an annual event in College, the scholars' house. It dates from the second half of the 19th century, when it appears to have been a formal and intimidating affair held in VIIth Chamber for College as a whole; similar events were held in Commoner houses. In 1872 there was a major scandal, known as the Tunding Row, when someone was beaten by the prefects for refusing to attend. The Warden imposed restrictions on the prefects' power to beat, and laid down that \\"What are called 'notions-exams' must exist no longer; that they were merely a disgraceful innovation of late years\\". The custom crept back on a more informal basis, being held by each chamber individually: in 1942 the Prefect of Hall's Book refers to \\"the difficulty of providing food at notions examinƒÅ\\". Traditionally it was held after the first two weeks of Short Half (the autumn term), and was designed to test new boys' familiarity with the manners and customs of the school. In the 1970s it was held on the Saturday evening when the clocks went back; latterly it was moved nearer the end of term. It marked the point at which the New Men (new entrants to College) traditionally became known as juniors or Jun: Men. During the evening, the scholars would gather by chamber for a meal, cooked by its members. The earlier tradition (1970s) was that this was held in an upstairs chamber (dormitory), and that the younger boys wore pyjamas and dressing gowns, while the rest remained in normal daytime costume. From the late 1980s or early 1990s, fancy dress was introduced. Each chamber would have a costume theme and, a few weeks in advance, the prefect in charge of each chamber would allocate fictional characters to each member of the chamber, who was then expected to dress up as that character. Examples of themes include 'Harry Potter', 'James Bond', and 'The Greek Gods'. After the meal, there would be a notions test. This test consisted of a series of esoteric questions, the answers to which the first years were expected to have learnt earlier that afternoon. Most questions were humorous in nature and many referred to people and activities from the beginning of the 20th century. In the last few years of the custom, if a first year got a question wrong he would be liable to have the remnants of the meal thrown at him. After the test (which no-one could actually fail), all seventy Collegemen would gather in Chamber Court to sing songs peculiar to College. The following questions are some of the more memorable: * Can you sing? All people that on earth do dwell (spoken). * Who is Jupiter? A notorious rascal of St. Cross, long since defunct, who has been a notion since time immemorial/immemorable. (Whichever form is used, all present loudly correct it to the other one.) * How many feathers are there in a clump? 7; 77; 777; 7777 &c.; [until told to stop] * Which one is Moses? The one that's not Aaron. * What was found by the Coalhole in the Coalhole? 5000 tons of processed peas. * Who put the apple in the teapot? Somebody else. If the Jun Man did not know the answer, the first three times he could answer \\"My pater told me but I forgot\\"; the fourth, fifth, and sixth times \\"My pater meant to tell me, but he forgot\\"; and three further times \\"My pater forgot to tell me\\". His pater (his mentor from the year above) would then be asked instead. It is said that, in the earlier and more serious (pre-war) form of notions examina, if the candidate failed to answer ten questions his pater was liable to be beaten. Notions tests ceased being held annually in 2001. The Pempe The Pempe was formerly a practical joke perpetrated in Commoners. A junior boy was asked to obtain a book called \\"Pempe ton moron proteron\\" (send the fool further); each person he asked for it would refer him to someone else, often in a different house, until someone took pity on him. A similar joke, involving an \\"important letter\\" with the words \\"send the fool further\\", was practised in Ireland on April Fools' Day. In College this was formalized as Pempe Sunday, held on the third Sunday of Short Half. Each new man was told to find a person with a given notional name and ask him for a Pempe. That person gave him a \\"half vessel\\" (piece of paper of prescribed dimensions), and sent him to someone else, also by his notional name, and so on. The penultimate person in the series (the College Matriarch) would write on the piece of paper the Greek sentence \\"œÄ·ºêŒºœÄŒµ œÄ·ºêŒºœÄŒµ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œº·Ω•œÅŒøŒΩ œÄœÅ·ΩÄœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ\\", and the last person (the College Patriarch) would add the accents: the new man is expected to keep his Pempe throughout his school career. The College man Frank Buckland described his own Pempe experience of 1839: By tradition, a notions book may not define a \\"Pempe\\" except for calling it \\"A necessity for all new men\\".As for example Lawson, 1901. p. 90 Epideixis Epideixis is an event held only for Collegemen (i.e. not for Commoners) in VIIth chamber on the night before the first game of X's, the original purpose being as an exercise in cheer-leading for the game. It involves the Captain of X's asking a list of questions of the form \\"Who is the...\\" or \\"Who does...\\" (identifying people or groups of people by their notional names, or activities that they may have perpetrated). The relevant people then run into the centre of the chamber shouting \\"Co-o-o-llege!\\", prolonging the first syllable as much as possible. The last group to be called up is invariably \\"The Hot\\" (the scrum in the College X's team). It is still very much as it was, though the questions are now subject to a mild degree of censorship.

Virtual Light is a science- fiction novel set in a postmodern, dystopian, cyberpunk future. The term 'Virtual Light' was coined by scientist Stephen Beck to describe a form of instrumentation that produces optical sensations directly in the eye without the use of photons.The William Gibson FAQ The novel was a finalist nominee for a Hugo Award, and shortlisted for the Locus Award in 1994. Plot summary The plot centers around Chevette Washington, a young bicycle messenger who lives in the ad hoc, off-the-grid community that has grown on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. Chevette, on a whim, steals a pair of dark-rimmed glasses from a man at a party because she is offended by his demeanor. Soon after, she realizes that the glasses have unlikely importance, as security company henchmen begin tracking and following her. Among the pursuers are Svobodov and Orlovsky, two Russian immigrants who reside in San Francisco and are employed as cops,Davis, Mike, \\"Virtual Light.\\" Artforum, 1993. as well as Loveless, a ruthless corporate hitman with gold incisors. The glasses contain plans by a powerful corporation to rebuild San Francisco entirely using nanotechnology, and for that reason, they are highly coveted and present a danger to the person who possesses them. Meanwhile, Berry Rydell, a former cop turned private security agent, is contracted to recover the pair of glasses for Lucius Warbaby, an intimidating and presumably successful \\"skip-tracer\\", a sort of bondsman/bounty hunter. When Rydell is given the mission, he is not informed of the significance of the glasses and the information they contain. Eventually, the plot climaxes when Rydell, Loveless, Warbaby, Orlovsky, and Svobodov all catch up with Chevette. The cops want the glasses, as does Rydell. Realizing the inherent danger of the situation, Rydell is forced to decide whom to side with. He decides to fight off Orlovsky and Svobodov and shirk his agreement with Warbaby. Instead, Rydell runs off with Chevette, and they embark upon a wild and treacherous journey in which they must remain one step ahead of their enemies, who have all the advantages of wealth and technology on their side. A subplot also focuses on a romantic relationship between Chevette and Rydell, which is initially restricted because of the nature of their circumstances, but is eventually allowed to flourish. Another subplot focuses on a Japanese sociologist named Shinya Yamazaki, who is currently studying the bridge dwellers and the history of their settlement. The subplot largely focuses on his interactions with Skinner, an old man who lives in a shack high atop one of the bridge's support pylons, who happens to share his home with Chevette. Setting The setting is California in 2006,Book Expo America Luncheon Talk, William Gibson's blog, May 31, 2010 . part of a dystopian world where the middle class has essentially evaporated leaving only multinational corporations and their exorbitantly rich elite and the poor who are mostly security officers, couriers, or otherwise work in minor service positions. Many of the poor live illegally and entirely outside the normal economy in places like The Bridge engaged in dubious enterprises such as theft, drugs, weapons, gambling, prostitution, and operation of unlicensed restaurants and doctor's offices. Others pursue livelihood in innocuous yet unregulated commerce such as by running antique shops and barbershops. Themes A major theme of Virtual Light is class conflict; Warbaby and the elite are placed against Rydell and Chevette. The elite see themselves as inherently superior, and view the underclass as amoral, ruthless, and dispensable. Another important element, which is common to cyberpunk, is the idea of the power structure withholding information from the general population. The information, in this case, are the plans to rebuild an entire city completely, regardless of what its inhabitants think, reminiscent of Haussmann's renovation of Paris. Main characters *Chevette Washington, a bike messenger with a rough past and uncertain future; she was abused as a child by her mother's boyfriend. At one point she was imprisoned, but escaped and was able to find a job as a courier. *Berry Rydell, a private security officer who has drifted from one job to another ever since his killing of a suspect and subsequent lawsuit by the man's family cost him his job as a police officer. *Lucius Warbaby, a bounty hunter hired to retrieve the stolen glasses by the corporation that made them. He in turn hires Rydell to assist him in finding the person who stole them. Due to a recent rollerblading injury, he requires a cane to walk. *Freddie, Warbaby's assistant. He has a fondness for loud, bright-colored print shirts, and carries a laptop with him wherever he goes. *Loveless, an agent sent by the company that made the glasses to retrieve them and kill whoever stole them. His most distinguishing features are his four gold canine teeth, visible at the corners of his mouth whenever he smiles. *Sublett, one of Rydell's fellow security guards. He is an albino with severe chemical allergies, and is a member of a Christian religious sect that views certain movies and television shows as a new form of gospel. *Sammy Sal Dupree, Chevette's friend who set her up with her courier job at Allied and tries to convince her to get rid of the glasses. He is presumed to be killed by Loveless halfway through the story, but it is revealed near the end that he survived. *Skinner, an old man that Chevette lives with. She helps him around the house, and together they also sell odds and ends to people for extra money. *Lowell, Chevette's old boyfriend who has ties to the Republic of Desire hacking ring. *Shinya Yamazaki, a Japanese national who describes himself as an \\"existential sociologist\\", currently studying the inhabitants of The Bridge. *Svobodov and Orlovsky, corrupt San Francisco cops who pursue Chevette in an attempt to obtain the glasses.

Idoru is a science-fiction novel set in a postmodern, dystopian, cyberpunk future. One of the main characters, Colin Laney, has a talent for identifying nodal points, analogous to Gibson's own: Plot summary In the post Tokyo/San Francisco earthquake world of the early 21st century, Colin Laney is referred to agents of mega-rock star Rez (of the musical group Lo/Rez) for a job using his peculiar talent of sifting through vast amounts of mundane data to find \\"nodal points\\" of particular relevance. Rez has claimed to want to marry a synthetic personality named Rei Toei, the Idoru (Japanese Idol) of the title, a claim stranger than usual and therefore questioned by his loyal staff, particularly by his head of security, Keith Blackwell. Blackwell believes that someone is manipulating Rez, and wants Laney to find out who. Simultaneously, the Seattle chapter of the Lo/Rez fan club is discussing exactly the same topic of the unbelievable marriage of human and AI construct. Fourteen-year-old Chia Pet McKenzie is chosen by the group to go to Tokyo and meet with the Tokyo chapter to find out what is really happening. On the flight she meets a woman named Maryalice, who dupes her into unwittingly carrying a contraband item through customs in Tokyo. Laney accepts his new position warily, but is conflicted throughout much of the novel by his past involvement with a powerful infotainment organization, \\"SlitScan\\", which thrives on destroying media personalities by exposing their secrets. In the course of this earlier job he feels responsible for the death of an innocent party. His talent had allowed him a foreshadowing of a probable suicide but SlitScan had tried to limit Laney's role to passive observer. However, Laney's conscience snapped and he attempted at the last moment to stop the suicide, but instead became mired in a scandal. Yet another organization claiming to be a media watchdog steps in and tries to pull Laney away from SlitScan to use his story to expose SlitScan‚Äôs involvement in illegal spying. This goes awry and Laney is left high and dry and alone. Further complicating Laney‚Äôs life is that Kathy Torrance, his controller from SlitScan, is attempting to blackmail him with false evidence into betraying his current employers, Lo/Rez, by exposing whatever secret she thinks they are hiding. Chia, after being brought to the club run by Maryalice‚Äôs boyfriend Eddie, is helped to escape by one of the club‚Äôs employees who perceives that she is in danger. She takes with her the contraband which was slipped into her luggage. When she meets with the local Tokyo chapter of the Lo/Rez fan club she is disappointed by their seeming indifference to the impending \\"wedding\\" and they inform her this is merely an unfounded rumor. Disbelieving, Chia decides to investigate on her own and seeks the help of her host Mitsuko‚Äôs brother Masahiko, an otaku who is a member of the hacker community the \\"Walled City\\" (a virtual community based on Kowloon Walled City). Masahiko and Chia embark on a search for the truth to the marriage of Rez and Rei by going to the club where Rez announced the event, though the club no longer exists in the rapidly changing Tokyo scene. Masahiko is informed by other denizens of Walled City that he is being watched, both on the net and physically at his (and his sister‚Äôs) home. Chia admits to Masahiko that she has found something in her luggage and that might be what the unknown men are seeking. The contraband turns out to be a highly illegal nanotech assembler, a device used for high-speed material fabrication, which Eddie smuggled in on behalf of the Kombinat. Chia and Masahiko go to a love hotel to try to hide from the searchers. It is here that all the parties converge. When Chia and Masahiko link into the net, the Idoru (Rei) manifests herself in Chia's Venice simulation after she realizes that Chia is playing a part in her evolution. Maryalice finds the hotel through their taxi record, letting herself into their room. Lamenting her recent breakup with Eddie over the botched smuggling operation, she tells them that giving back the device won‚Äôt stop them from being killed as witnesses. Masahiko and Chia go onto the Net to get the help of Chia‚Äôs friend Zona Rosa, who claims to be the leader of a Mexico City \\"girl gang\\" and from the denizens of the distributed system, Walled City. In short order, Maryalice‚Äôs boyfriend Eddie shows up with a member of the Kombinat to reclaim the nanotech device. This prompts Zona Rosa (who has been viewing events over the net) into making a terrible personal sacrifice to save Chia. Events rapidly come to a head when Rez and Blackwell arrive. Laney sees events occurring (and about to occur) in the datastreams and rushes with Lo/Rez‚Äôs support crew to the love hotel. A deal is struck and most of the parties are accommodated. The ultimate resolution is left open as to whether the Rez/Rei union is made possible with the nanotechnology that they have obtained.

It is a tolled motorway that is owned and operated by NorthWestern Roads Group (NWR) and connects three motorways: M5 South Western Motorway at Prestons, M4 Western Motorway at Eastern Creek and M2 Hills Motorway at Baulkham Hills. It opened on 16 December 2005, eight months ahead of schedule. The M7 cycleway runs parallel to Westlink M7.  History  Western Sydney is the fastest growing part of the Sydney metropolitan area. The Ring Road 5 and State Route 55 ‚Äì and later State Route 77 ‚Äì originally meant to bypass Sydney, had instead become primary arteries for the western suburbs. By the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century Western Sydney had become the third biggest producer of Australia's GDP, after the Sydney CBD and Melbourne. The growth of industrial and residential areas brought about a massive increase in traffic on its local roads. This led to the planning of the Western Sydney Orbital which, among its original purposes, was to serve the stillborn second international airport at Badgerys Creek. In January 2001 the federal government made a commitment to progressively contribute A$356 million to the M7 project, with the remaining A$1.5 billion required for the design and construction provided by the private sector. The NSW Minister for Planning authorised the undertaking in February 2002. The M7 Motorway was privately funded through an innovative construction contract method known as a \\"deed\\" to facilitate the expedition of the tendering phase; several deeds were drawn up based on the contractors proposals. The deed was for the full design, construction, operation and maintenance of the motorway including more than of continuously reinforced concrete (CRCP) and asphalt roads, upgrading of local roads, the longest free-flowing (no toll booths) toll road in the world at the time. More than 90 bridges (of four different types) and the largest shared path network in the southern hemisphere. The design, construct, operate and maintain contract worth at least A$2.0 billion was awarded to WSO (Western Sydney Orbital Pty Ltd) by the Roads & Traffic Authority. The design and construct portion of the contract valued at A$1.8 billion was awarded to a joint venture between Abigroup and Leighton Contractors (ALJV) with design work undertaken by a further joint venture by Maunsell AECOM and SMEC (Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation) with further subcontracting to other designers (Arup) and independent verification by Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM). The motorway was opened to traffic in 2005. WSO (commonly known as Westlink) operate the motorway with maintenance subcontracted to Westlink Services and tolling to ROAM. With its opening, Metroad 7 between Liverpool and Beecroft was transferred from Cumberland Highway to Westlink M7. Westlink M7 was the first Sydney motorway to be marked with an alphanumeric shield rather than the hexagonal Metroad shield. On 25 December 2005, just 9 days after opening, the M7 suffered its first fatality: a 12-year-old boy died at Cecil Park when the four-wheel drive he was travelling in rolled down an embankment and onto Elizabeth Drive, almost crushing another car.  Route  Light Horse Interchange The M7 originates at the Roden Cutler Interchange, a Y-junction with the M31 Hume Motorway and M5 South Western Motorway at Prestons, and weaves to the west of Liverpool to the junction of Elizabeth Road and Wallgrove Road in Abbotsbury. From then on it runs parallel to Wallgrove Road north towards the Great Western Highway and the Light Horse interchange, a stack junction with the M4. Continuing north, it leads to Minchinbury and follows alongside Rooty Hill Road up to Dean Park at an exit with Rooty Hill Road North and Richmond Road. From this junction the M7 turns eastward along the preserved Castlereagh Freeway corridor through Quakers Hill and Kings Langley up to the interchange with Old Windsor Road to Norwest Business Park and continues southeast to reconcile with the existing M2 Hills Motorway in Baulkham Hills. It is 4 lanes (2 lanes each way) for its entire length. =Light Horse Interchange= The Light Horse Interchange is the junction of the M4 and M7 motorways. The stack interchange is the largest of its type in the southern hemisphere. It was named in honour of an Australian World War One formation, the Australian Light Horse.Light Horse Interchange at Westlink  Tolls  The Westlink was built as a fully tolled, gateless motorway employing electronic payment, with an initial toll-free period that ended on 15 January 2006. The toll was originally 29.91 cents per kilometre, capped after at $5.98. On 1 April 2006, this increased to 30.07 cents per kilometre, capped after at $6.01. , the toll was 38.31 cents per kilometre, capped at $7.66, and adjusted quarterly according to the CPI.

The trilogy comprises the novels Virtual Light (1993), Idoru, (1996) and All Tomorrow's Parties (1999). A short story, \\"Skinner's Room\\", was originally composed for Visionary San Francisco, a 1990 museum exhibition exploring the future of San Francisco. Setting Bridge, pre-quake The first book of the Bridge trilogy is set in an imaginary 2006, with the subsequent books set a few years later.Book Expo America Luncheon Talk, William Gibson's blog, May 31, 2010 . The books deal with the race to control the beginnings of cyberspace technology and are set on the United States' West coast in a post-earthquake California (divided into the separate states of NoCal and SoCal), as well as a post-earthquake Tokyo, Japan, that had been rebuilt using nanotechnology. The trilogy derives its name from the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, which was abandoned in an earthquake and has become a massive shantytown and a site of improvised shelter. The bridge becomes a pivotal location in Virtual Light and All Tomorrow's Parties. The 'bridge' may also be interpreted as a metaphor for the nascent technologies bridging contemporaneous life and the highly advanced future depicted in the Sprawl trilogy, where cyberspace and nanotechnology are fully developed and commonplace. Characters in each novel interact in a cyberspace construct of Kowloon Walled City, which is initially described as an inverted kill file. The walled city shares a number of features with the bridge itself, including an emphasis on self-governance and efficiency in user-construction. Characters The novels of the Bridge trilogy loosely share a common cast of characters. Former police officer Berry Rydell and bicycle courier Chevette Washington occupy central roles in the first and third novels. Researcher Colin Laney, who has a mysterious ability to identify patterns in vast tracts of information, appears in Idoru and All Tomorrow's Parties. Other recurring characters include Rei Toei, an AI pop star, and Shinya Yamazaki, an existential sociologist. Critical reception and influence Canadian Poet Douglas Barbour said of the trilogy that it \\"has all the stylistic verve of his earlier work, but it asks some tougher questions, explores character more deeply, and savagely interrogates our star-obsessed society.\\" Virtual Light, the first novel in the series, was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1994.

Bronner has published over 25 books and 200 journal articles. Early life and education Born in New York City, New York, United States on 19 August 1949, Bronner earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) at City College of New York, spent a year at the Universit√§t T√ºbingen in Germany on a Fulbright-Hays Fellowship in 1973, and completed his Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1976. Career Bronner has been employed at Rutgers University since 1976, and has held visiting professor positions at the New School for Social Research (1989) the Universit√§t Leipzig (1998). Bronner is Director of Global Relations at the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University, and the Executive Chair of US Academics for Peace and an advisor to Conscience International. His activities in civic diplomacy led him to audiences with presidents and high ranking political dignitaries in Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Sudan, Darfur, Ukraine, and Russia. Some of these experiences are discussed in his books dealing with the internal politics of these nations in Blood in the Sand (2005), Peace out of Reach (2007), and The Bitter Taste of Hope (2017). Invitations to speak at universities and conferences all over the United States, Japan, China and South Africa have been numerous. Bronner is a contributing editor at Logos and on the editorial board of other journals. His various works include studies of contemporary political theory, political history, and cultural politics.  Sexual assault allegations  Bronner has been accused of sexual assault by students and colleagues. After Rutgers University reversed their decision not to investigate, they put Bronner on a paid research sabbatical until their investigation is over. Bronner claims that none of the alleged assaults happened. Campus officials \\"found no proof he violated any school policies.\\" Theoretical contributions Influenced by critical theory, existentialism, and liberal socialism, Bronner is best known for his reinterpretation of tradition and a host of concepts like the class ideal and the cosmopolitan sensibility. He is perhaps the foremost contemporary proponent of developing the linkage of political theory with practical and progressive political concerns. His work is discussed in Rational Radicalism and Political Theory: Essays in Honor of Stephen Eric Bronner, ed. by Michael J. Thompson (Lanham: Lexington Books, 2010).

He has three consecutive degrees including a PhD from Harvard University. He currently resides in Charlottesville. He attracted attention when he published research into alleged vampire folklore in the 1970s that was easily sensationalized in the press and has a vogue among vampire fans. Perkowski wrote about a Kashubian idiolect and was employed by the National Museum of Man in Canada in 1968-9 to conduct research for the Canadian Centre for Folk Culture Studies in the area of Wilno, Ontario, to study Kashubian Polish folklore and traditions. His 1972 report, \\"Vampires, Dwarves, And Witches Among The Ontario Kashubs\\"How to Kill a Vampire: An excerpt (and guide) from Liisa Ladouceur's book of the same name inspired sensational articles in Psychology Today, The Canadian Magazine, and The National Enquirer which got it denounced on the floor of the Canadian House of Commons. Kashubians in Wilno, Ontario allegedly believe that \\"the only remedy against this kind of future vampirism was to extract the teeth from the infants.

Perkowski was previously employed at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the University of Texas, Austin, and the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA. He taught classes on Slavic languages, diachronic linguistics, the occult and vampires, and courses such as \\"How to be a Spy.\\" He is now retired. In 1989, he published The Darkling: A Treatise on Slavic Vampirism which contains original vampire accounts translated into English from over twenty languages, many for the first time, including a vampire trial in Dubrovnik in 1737. The book is currently being added as a chapter in his forthcoming work Vampire Lore. However, he was best known for teaching an undergraduate class called \\"Dracula\\", covering vampire mythology in western culture from ancient times to the present. Perkowski himself approaches the vampire as an outgrowth of the culture in which its legend arose - often more a morality tale than anything else. After his retirement, the course was taken on by his former student Stanley Stepanic, a known noise musician and demonologist.

It seemed as if it had everything going for it: Investors with very deep pockets, relationships with top media brands of the world, contracts with large operators, an extensive worldwide gaming network, a very dynamic public image and worldwide presence.

Hay, a trained pianist since the age of five, replaced founding member Johnny Suede in 1981. Some of Hay's musical influences were Stevie Wonder, The Isley Brothers and Led Zeppelin. Before his involvement with Culture Club, Hay was a hairdresser in his native Essex. It was during Culture Club's beginnings that Hay met Alison Green. The two married in 1982 and had a child, Sunny, in 1986. They divorced in 2005, although the two had been separated since 1995. According to the \\"Culture Club\\" episode the VH-1 series Behind the Music, Hay assisted Boy George in giving up heroin. The singer suffered the painful withdrawal symptoms closely attended by Hay in his Essex home. Following Culture Club, Hay formed another band, called This Way Up, with singer Robinson Reid. In 1987, they released three singles: \\"Tell Me Why\\", \\"If I Can't Have You\\" and \\"Louise\\". An album, Feeling Good About It, was released in some European countries and in Japan in 1987. All those records flopped, \\"Tell Me Why\\" being the only one that charted, for one week at number 72 in the UK Singles Chart. Hay moved to Los Angeles, U.S. in 1989 and from there wrote for and produced young artists and bands for Sony Music. He branched into commercial composing and sound design with his own company Haywired Music. Hay found later success as a composer in Hollywood, California, working with fellow composer Hans Zimmer and composing the music for a series directed by Robert Altman, as well as the music for Cracker and for Stephen King's The Dead Zone. Hay reunited with the three original members of Culture Club in 1998 to record a new album. In a Rolling Stone interview, Hay described the years apart as a healing process. \\"There was obviously a bit of a healing process that needed to happen between Jon [Moss] and George. They hadn't really spoken to each other in quite a while\\". The description of the tour was \\"Older and wiser...We've all been through some good and bad times since the band.

Saint-Jean-de-Luz is part of the Basque province of Labourd (Lapurdi). Geography Saint-Jean-de-Luz bay is a natural harbour in the south-east of the Bay of Biscay. It is the only sheltered bay between Arcachon and Spain. Thanks to its strong sea walls or dykes that protect the town from the full savagery of the Atlantic Ocean, it has become a favorite for bathers across the Basque Coast. Although the seaside resort is relatively recent, the port itself is centuries old, with the most prominent point in its history being the marriage in 1660 of Louis XIV and the Spanish princess Maria Teresa. Fishermen from St Jean de Luz Water from the area flows into the town from the Nivelle and its smaller tributaries, the Etxeberri, Isaka and Xantako streams. There is also the Basarun, and its smaller tributary the Mendi, which passes directly through Saint-Jean-de-Luz. The river has been made accessible to boats and it joins the sea by the Erromardia beach. A branch of the Uhabia, an emblematic river in the neighbouring Bidart district, and its smaller Amisola tributary, also pass to the sea through St Jean de Luz. Etymology Saint-Jean-de-Luz is French for Labourdin√© Basque. For starters, the common mistake of understanding 'Luz' as the Spanish word for light is very extended. In this case 'Luz' is a mutation of the word 'Lohitz'(Loiz,Luz) Donibane Lohizune: first element: done 'saint' (from Latin d√≥minus 'lord, master') and ibane John, thus Donibane is Saint John; lohi 'mud; suffix z 'manner, according to; with, made of'; and suffix une 'place of': 'mud place, swamp'. The name of the town comes in accord to all the times the town has been flooded over the centuries and has subsequently building the dikes and lifted a wall by the beach.With help from G. Aulestia and L. White: Basque-English English-Basque dictionary, Reno, NV, 1992, Univ. of Nevada Press. Transportation Saint-Jean-de-Luz straddles Route d√©partementale D810, the old Route nationale 10. The town can be reached from the A63 motorway, Exit 3 (Saint-Jean-de-Luz Nord) and Exit 2 (Saint-Jean-de-Luz Sud). The Saint-Jean- de-Luz-Ciboure railway station is served by the SNCF Bordeaux‚ÄìIrun railway. Biarritz Airport is the closest airport to Saint-Jean-de-Luz. History Saint-Jean-de-Luz is located on the Atlantic coast of France, just a few kilometres from the border with Spain. Its wealth stems from its port and its past, with the town being associated with both fishing, and with the capture of vessels by its own Basque corsaires, or pirates (English sailors used to call Saint-Jean-de-Luz the \\"Viper's Nest\\").http://aquitaine.wikidot.com/st- jean-de-luz This prosperity reached its height during the 17th Century, which is still considered as the town's \\"Golden Age.\\" During this period, Saint- Jean-De-Luz became the second largest town in the Labourd region with a population or around 12,000, just behind Bayonne. =Marriage of Louis XIV= Saint-Jean-de-Luz is known for its royal wedding connection. In 1659, Cardinal Mazarin spent several months in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, from where he would embark on almost daily trips to Pheasant Island in the River Bidassoa (near modern- day Hendaye) for Franco-Spanish meetings that resulted in the Treaty of the Pyrenees, one clause of which was the marriage of Louis XIV to Maria Theresa, the Infanta of Spain. Saint-Jean-de-Luz and its church were chosen to host the royal wedding on 9 June 1660. The marriage is one of the most important political marriages in history that brought an end to a bitter war. Today, visitors of the cathedral can see that the main door is bricked off. Two legends circulate this oddity: First, it has been said that the door the couple passed through was later closed to represent the closing of the troubles between France and Spain. A more popular theory among the locals is that the king, Louis XIV, ordered the door to be closed off, so no other couple could walk into the church to be married in his footsteps. =Peninsular War= The Duke of Wellington set up his winter headquarters in the town during the Peninsular War, 1813‚Äì14. =End of the nineteenth century= View over the town, and Ciboure (Ziburu) in the foreground, 1895 Infanta of Spain's House St-Jean-de Luz Town Hall To the end of the nineteenth century, Saint-Jean-de-Luz became a popular beachside resort town for the surrounding high-society. Like Biarritz (called \\"The queen of the beaches, the beach of kings\\"), Saint-Jean-de-Luz was particularly appreciated by the French and Spanish aristocracy. By the early 1900s, it turned into the scene of Carlist conspiratorial activities. The composer Maurice Ravel, a native of the nearby town of Ciboure, frequently vacationed at Saint-Jean-de-Luz from Paris, where he was centered for almost his entire life. Following Marshal P√©tain's call for an armistice on the outset of World War II, a coastal fringe of the Basque Country fell in the German occupation area. Before the agreement was enforced, a retreating Polish Army was evacuated from the town in mid June 1940. =Postwar= After 1945, some of the traditional fishing-based industries of the Fargeot district gradually disappeared, mainly by overfishing and competition from elsewhere. The change strengthened the transformation of the town towards more luxury and tourism industries. In Saint-Jean-de-Luz over 40% of dwellings of the town are second homes. Saint- Jean-de-Luz In the 1960s, the town expanded northwards (Avenue de l‚ÄôOcean) and also southwards in the direction of (the Urdazuri district). Since the 1970s, St Jean de Luz has been connected to Bordeaux to the north and Spain to the south by the motorway, and more recently by the TGV railway. St-Jean-de-Luz boasts extensive and attractive land and scenery, as well as a well-preserved coastline which has so far escaped urbanisation. Indeed, some of the Basque coast has seen a degree of development, but the area between Fort Socoa and the Abbadia nature reserve and castle remains well protected. Housing beach. Saint-Jean-de-Luz is a fishing port on the Basque coast and now a famous resort, known for its architecture, sandy bay, the quality of the light and the cuisine. The town is located south of Biarritz, on the right bank of the river Nivelle (French for Urdazuri) opposite to Ciboure. The port lies on the estuary just before the river joins the ocean. The summit of Larrun is about south-east of the town. The summit can be reached by the Petit train de la Rhune, which starts from the Col de Saint-Ignace, east of the town on the D4 road to Sare. It is in the traditional province of Lapurdi of the Basque Country. Cultural heritage The town features a large number of residences built in the 17th and 18th centuries along the Quai de L'Infante, Rue Mazarin, Rue Gambetta and at the Place Louis XIV. In some respects this is testament to the families, shipowners and Basque merchants from this period. One of these, built alongside the Quai de L'Infante around 1640, is called the \\"Maison Joanoenea,\\" and it is here that the Queen Mother, Anne of Austria, stayed before the marriage of Louis XIV to Maria Theresa, the Infanta of Spain on 8 May 1660. The Infanta stayed there on 7 June. Locally this house is referred to as the \\"Maison de l'Infante\\", and it has become a popular tourist attraction and museum. A monument in the Verdun Square honours the memory of the fallen soldiers from World War I and World War II, and another monument on the Quai L‚ÄôInfante is dedicated to the resistance movement Orion. This second plaque commemorates the importance of the work of French escape networks which helped people evade capture in Occupied France during World War II. Finally, there are some bunkers still visible along the coast. These formed part of the infamous Atlantic Wall, German defences against the anticipated Allied invasion of Westen France. Some remains are still visible on the Santa-Barbe promenade. Tourism Nowadays, St-Jean-de-Luz depends strongly on tourism with safe clean beaches, notable high quality hotels and a seawater spa, swimming pools, a casino, golf courses and a conference centre that is under construction. The town also benefits from regional tourism, with many attracted by the pedestrian area full of shops open all year round. It also attracts a large number of visitors from Basque Country, Spain, or Gipuzkoa along with many from nearby Bayonne and the rest of southwestern France. The city is particularly attractive to retired people, many of whom come to settle there from other areas across France. Church of St. John the Baptist Many cultural and sporting events are held throughout the year. There are internships and public concerts of classical music organized by the Acad√©mie Ravel, usually in the auditorium of the same name. There is a film festival dedicated to young filmmakers, a surfing film festival and Basque Pelota championships. The tradition of the Basque ‚ÄòTrials of Strength‚Äô The origin of Basque Trials of Strength is found in the daily tasks carried out across the region. For centuries, young Basque farmers pitted themselves against each other in physical challenges. Labouring in the forests of the Basque country gave rise to the challenge known as aizkolariak (based on lumberjacks working with an ax or arpanariak), as well as athletic sawing of tree stumps and wood. The construction of buildings, often based on large stones for the cathedrals and monasteries led to the development of the challenge known as arrijasotzaileak ‚Äì literally those who lift stones. Several events originate from working in the fields, the best known of which is lastoaltxatzea, the lifting of straw bales. This is done either using a pitchfork or a pulley, and is often organized in tandem with joko (cart-lifting), zakulasterka (individual relay or sack races), and untziketariak, a race involving pitchers of milk. Also well-known is soka-shot, or tug-of-war, which is an internationally recognised discipline celebrated in fourteen countries.

At the start of the 2002 season, the club was dissolved. A new club, York City Knights was established to take the Wasps' place for the 2003 season. History =Early years= The club was first formed as \\"York Football Club\\" in 1868 and played both association and rugby football, for the first few seasons they had portable goal posts as they did not have their own ground and would play wherever they could find a pitch. Eventually a permanent pitch was secured on Knavesmire. Other early grounds included Clifton Ings and Poad's Field. It took three years for the club to record their first victory, and that was in an association football match against York Training College. Results picked up in the mid-1870s as the club attracted a higher standard of player. In 1877, York were among several leading Yorkshire clubs who inaugurated the Yorkshire Challenge Cup. In the first season 16 teams battled it out for the T'owd Tin Pot, with York eventually losing out to Halifax in the final. In 1883 the club moved to the Wigginton Road Cricket Ground of the Yorkshire Gentlemen and also amalgamated with York Melbourne Club. In 1884, they were asked to leave the ground due to financial problems and spoiling the playing surface. The club moved to Grange St (Fishergate). In 1885, the club leased a plot of land from the York Lunatic (Bootham) Asylum at the end of the Clarence Street in 1885. The first game at the new site was between a York XV and 20 players from the city on 19 September 1885. The club made great strides with the team of 1895, which won virtually all their home matches. Off the field the club paid ¬£85 for the Waterman's Mission Hut in Fishergate and converted it into their first grandstand, incorporating dressing rooms. Previously players had changed, first at the Adelphi Hotel (later The Railway King) on George Hudson St and later at Shorts Baths (Clarence St).York Wasps RLFC match programme. 26 March 1989. p. 8. =Northern Union= Northern rugby teams broke away from the Rugby Football Union to form their own Northern Union in 1895. York initially stayed with the Rugby Football Union but as more and more clubs began to join the new order, it became a financial necessity to follow suit. The decision to join the Northern Union was taken at a meeting at the Bar Hotel, Micklegate, on Monday, 25 April 1898 and five days later they played their first Northern Union match against Hull Kingston Rovers losing 29‚Äì2. Team of 1900‚Äì01 season The York club was first admitted to the Rugby Football League in 1901. In 1902/03 the Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues were combined to form a second division. They defeated the touring All Golds team in 1908.The All Golds York was one of the new teams to join the second division. After the First World War, they became known as \\"the Dreadnoughts\\". They beat the visiting Australasian team of the 1921‚Äì22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain 9‚Äì3. York played touring teams on a number of occasions between 1908 and 1978. There were 8 games against Australia (one win and one draw) and 6 games against New Zealand (3 wins).York Wasps RLFC match programme. 26 March 1989. P 23. York's best moment came in 1931 when they reached the Challenge Cup Final for the first time, only to be beaten 22‚Äì8 by Halifax. York had finished as the top Yorkshire club in 1932‚Äì33 for the first time and fourth in the league to qualify for the Championship play-offs but were beaten by Swinton. In the 1922/3 season, York beat Batley 5‚Äì0 in the Yorkshire Cup final held at Headingley. In 1933, York beat Hull Kingston Rovers 10‚Äì4 in the Yorkshire Cup final held at Headingley. 10 February 1934, York's record attendance was set when 14,689 turned up to watch a Challenge Cup match against Swinton, which ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw. York again made the final of the Yorkshire Cup in 1935 but were beaten by Leeds 3‚Äì0 at Thrum Hall, Halifax but were back the next year this time beating Wakefield Trinity 9‚Äì2 in a final held at Headingley. They also lost the 1978 final to Bradford Northern by 18‚Äì8. Bill Kirkbride became coach in 1980. York team lifted the Division Two title in 1980‚Äì81, beating Hunslet 53‚Äì7 to guarantee themselves the title with two games to spare, finishing above big-guns Wigan and big-spending Fulham. Kirkbride left in 1982. Immediate relegation was followed by promotion in 1985. Financial problems forced the club to sell their training pitch (behind The Popular Stand) for ¬£200,000 in 1986. Three years later faced with a large bill for safety work, the rest of the stadium was sold to a housing developer for ¬£705,000, less than half what the ground was worth. On 26 March 1989 York's last match at Clarence Street produced a 26‚Äì17 victory over Hunslet in front of a crowd of 2,904 spectators. =Ryedale-York= Gary Stephens became coach in 1988. When plans to ground share with York City F.C. broke down, York moved to the newly constructed Ryedale Stadium two miles to the north of the city at Huntington in Ryedale district. As the stadium was financed by Ryedale District Council the club became known as Ryedale-York. The first league game at the new stadium was on 8 October 1989 against Keighley. Ryedale Stadium's record attendance for a rugby league match was set on 5 January 1990 when 4,977 turned up to watch a division two match against Halifax. In 1991, Ryedale-York and Fulham toured Russia, an act that caused many Russian rugby union clubs to switch to rugby league. Stephens left as coach. Ryedale-York were demoted to the Third Division in 1992 having finished seventh in the Second Division. The next year, they were back in the Second Division as the league returned to a two division structure with the bulk of Third Division sides joining the new Second Division. Stuart Horton took over the coaching reins from Roger Millward in January 1995. Ryedale-York conceived a 'Super League plan' with Gateshead Council in 1995 with the intention intention of moving to Gateshead. The club's last game as Ryedale-York took place in April, an away game against Carlisle that was played in Gateshead. The relocation never came to pass and owing to a change in local council boundaries, Huntingdon, was now a civil parish in the newly formed unitary authority of the City of York. The newly renamed York Wasps playing at the Huntingdon stadium were confirmed as being in the Second Division which was now the third tier of rugby league, on 30 April. =York Wasps= York were beaten by amateur side West Hull 10‚Äì6 in the Challenge Cup on Humberside on a frozen pitch, in the 1996 Challenge Cup. They became the first professional side to lose to an amateur club in the fourth round, and it was only the third time a minnow had triumphed against a giant in the event since the Second World War. Horton was sacked at the end of 1996 for alleged gross misconduct after the postponement of a friendly fixture at Hull. Dean Robinson was appointed Coach for the 1997 Season with York Wasps in Division 2. In Season 1998 York won promotion under Robinson into Division 1. However in 1999 both divisions were brought together as the Northern Ford Premiership, with York finishing 7th in the newly formatted division. York won one game in the Northern Ford Premiership in 2000 and finished the campaign with a team of amateurs after almost folding. Due to financial difficulties and problems with training facilities coach Dean Robinson resigned in the early part of the season in March 2000. Caretaker coach Garry Atkins took over for three months and tried to manage the team with the club in grave difficulties. Lee Crooks took over as coach in August 2000. They attracted sponsorship from the New York Economic Development Council for the 2001 season. This promised, but did not deliver, a bright future. Lee Crooks resigned and academy coach Martin Flynn took charge for the final Northern Ford Premiership home game. York made an approach to Virgin to buy the London Broncos in August 2001 and form a merged club under a new name, York Wasps Ltd, to play in Super League. Australian Leo Epifania came over to England to be head coach of York Wasps in September. On 19 March 2002, after completing 11 games, York Wasps announced that they had folded. After a last-ditch take-over deal to save the Wasps collapses, the RFL accept the club's resignation on 26 March 2002. Ironically the plug was pulled less than a fortnight after the club's first win in 13 months. Head coach, Leo Epifania quit England but York players continued to train with the idea of playing later in the season under unpaid caretaker-boss Stuart Horton. A supporters' trust working party was formed on 27 March 2002 and applied to the RFL to continue the 2002 Northern Ford Premiership fixtures. After hearing it would be impossible to meet requirements to return that season, on 5 May 2002 fans backed new proposals for a new club to apply for admittance to the league for 2003, and a new club, York City Knights, was subsequently established. *Yorkshire County Cup: 3 **1922‚Äì23, 1933‚Äì34, 1936‚Äì37 Coaching register * Bill Kirkbride 1980‚Äì81 * Alan Hardisty 1982 * Phil Lowe 1983‚Äì7York City RL ‚Äì Geoff Pryce Testimonial Brochure. 1990. p. 19. * Danny Sheehan 1987‚Äì8York City RL ‚Äì Geoff Pryce Testimonial Brochure. 1990. p. 19. * Gary Stephens 1988‚Äì91 * Derek Foster 1992 * Steve Crooks 1993 * Roger Millward * Stuart Horton 1995‚Äì6 * Dean Robinson 1997‚Äì2000 * Gary Atkins 2000 * Lee Crooks 2000‚Äì1 * Martin Flynn 2001 * Leo Epifania 2001‚Äì2002 * Stuart Horton =Players earning international caps while at York= * Barry Banks won caps for England while at York in 1979 France (sub) * Craig Booth won caps for Scotland while at York in 1998 I(i)reland, F(f)rance * Edgar Dawson won caps for Great Britain while at York in 1956 1-cap * Norman Fender (No.11/No.12) won caps for Wales (RU) while at Cardiff RFC in 1930 against Ireland and France, and in 1931 against England, Scotland, France and Ireland, represented Great Britain (RL) while at York on the 1932/33 tour to Australasia playing in 14 tour (non-Test matches), scoring 11-tries, and won caps for Wales (RL) while at York 1932...1938 9-caps.[2] * Harry Field won caps for Great Britain while at York in 1936 Australia, New Zealand (2 matches) * Lee Hanlan won caps for Ireland while at York in 1996 S(s)cotland, in 1997 F(f)rance * Arthur Lloyd won a cap for Wales while at York in 1931 1-cap * Neil Lowe won caps for Scotland while at Featherstone Rovers, Doncaster, York and Keighley 1999...present 3-caps + 4-caps (sub) * F.

Stitching the Standard by Edmund Leighton (1911), oil on canvas In military organizations, the practice of carrying colours, standards or guidons, both to act as a rallying point for troops and to mark the location of the commander, is thought to have originated in Ancient Egypt some 5,000 years ago. The Roman Empire also made battle standards a part of their vast armies. It was formalized in the armies of Europe in the High Middle Ages, with standards being emblazoned with the commander's coat of arms. General use Napoleon I awarding the Legion d'Honneur to a dragoon for the capture of an Imperial regimental flag. As armies became trained and adopted set formations, each regiment's ability to keep its formation was potentially critical to its, and therefore its army's, success. In the chaos of battle, not least due to the amount of dust and smoke on a battlefield, soldiers needed to be able to determine where their regiment was. Regimental flags are generally awarded to a regiment by a head of state during a ceremony. They were therefore treated with reverence as they represented the honour and traditions of the regiment. Colours may be inscribed with the names of battles or other symbols representing former achievements (see battle honours). Regiments tended to adopt \\"colour guards\\", composed of experienced or √©lite soldiers, to protect their colours. As a result, the capture of an enemy's standard was considered as a great feat of arms. They are never capriciously destroyed ‚Äì when too old to use they are replaced and then laid-up in museums, religious buildings and other places of significance to their regiment. However, in most modern armies, standing orders now call for the Colours to be intentionally destroyed if they are ever in jeopardy of being captured by the enemy. Due to the advent of modern weapons, and subsequent changes in tactics, Colours are no longer carried into battle, but continue to be used at events of formal character. Colours =Americas= Argentina Each unit of the Argentine Armed Forces, the Argentine National Gendarmerie, the Argentine Federal Police and the Argentine Naval Prefecture bears the national colours, called National War Flag, which are the national flag with the unit's name embroidered on it in gold thread. The colours are carried by the unit's most junior officer, escorted by two NCOs, except in academies and schools, where it is carried by the top-ranked student of the senior course, and escorted by his or her second- and third-ranked classmates. If a decoration has been awarded to the unit, it's attached to the national colours' cravat. The national colours are never dipped in salute, except to salute another national colours which pass by or are being the subject of a special honour. Besides the national colours, each unit has its unique regimental colours, normally in the arm or service's color background, with the unit's coat of arms on it. Units which were made part of the Army of the Andes during Argentina's independence war also carry the Flag of the Army of the Andes. Brazil Units of the Brazilian Armed Forces carry a stand of two Colours, differing per service. The standard of the Army measures 80 √ó 120 cm, white with the Army coat of arms in the centre, trimmed with gold fringe. The name of the service is inscribed in gold letters on a green scroll beneath the shield. Above the shield is a knight's helmet with red and sky blue mantling. The staff is topped by a nickel-plated lance-head finial, 32 cm high. Below the lance-head, there is a cravat (la√ßo militar) divided lengthwise, sky blue and red, with a gold fringe at the end, tied in a bow and fastened with a cockade of blue with the Southern Cross in white stars, red, and blue. Ten red streamers with campaign honours inscribed in sky blue letters are also attached below the lance-head. The staff is 212 cm long, not including the lance-head, and 3.5 cm in diameter. It is covered in sky blue velvet with a red spiral strip. The colour belt is 10 cm in width, covered with sky blue velvet with red velvet stripes. The Navy's flag uses dark blue colours, the Air Force flag ultramarine blue. Brazilian military units also carry the national flag as a National Colour. This is in the dimensions 90 √ó 128 cm. It is mounted on the same size staff and with the same finial as the Army standard, but the cravat is divided lengthwise yellow and green, with a gold fringe at the end, tied in a bow and fastened with a cockade of blue with the Cruzeiro do Sul in white stars, yellow, and green. The staff is covered in green velvet with a yellow spiral strip. The colour belt is 10 cm in width, covered with green velvet with yellow velvet stripes of width and number varying with the rank of the organization's commander. Unit colors differ per service branch and speciality. Chile Units of the Chilean Army carry one main Colour, known as the estandarte de combate (combat standard). This is the same as the national flag, but with an embroidered star and with the unit designation, honorific title, founding date and place, and, depending on the unit, other historic information and honours embroidered diagonally across the fly in gold. The flag is also trimmed with gold fringe. It is mounted on a staff with a gilt condor finial; below the finial is a cravat in the national colours with decorations attached. In addition to the military Colour, particularly distinguished units, and long serving units may carry a second Colour known as a bandera coronela (colonel's colour). This is a red field with a large white five-pointed star. In the angles of the star are the names and dates of battle honours surrounded by laurel wreaths, all in gold, while in an arc above the star is the designation of the unit, also in gold. The flag is also surrounded by gold fringe. Since 2017, the 16th Infantry Regiment Talca became the first to sport a blue coloured bandera coronela in honor of its origins as a city guard battalion formed during the War of the Pacific. The Chilean Air Force, the Chilean Navy, the Carabineros de Chile and the Chilean Gendarmerie all use the estandarte de combate as their main colour, and do not use the bandera coronela at all. The design is the same as in the Army's. Colombia The main state colours of the Military Forces of Colombia and the National Police of Colombia is the Flag of Colombia with the Coat of arms of Colombia in the centre inside a circle with a red border, used by all the services. These flags also carry medals and decorations attached to the flag. The MFC and the NPC also uses unit regimental colours and battle colors, that differ accordingly per service. All of them are gold fringed.  Cuba  Cuba's military colours under the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces tend to follow a mix of the Soviet and US practice, as the Cuban flag is treated as a National Colour. * Regiments/Wings: bicolor vertical flag with a white field in the center with the Coat of Arms of Cuba and the service or branch color at the sides * Infantry Divisions of the Revolutionary Army, Territorial Troops Militias, Youth Labor Army and Camilio Cienfuegos Military Schools System: Red with coat of arms with title on gold or white surrounding * Armored Divisions: Black with coat of arms with title on white * Air Force Brigades: Blue with coat of arms with title on white surrounding * Antonio Maceo Military College and Jose Maceo Military College: Red and Black with coat of arms * Naval Academy: White with two blue stripes  El Salvador  El Salvador's military colours under the Salvadoran Armed Forces are heavily following US models, as the Salvadoran flag is treated as a National Colour. Mexico The Mexican Armed Forces use the Flag of Mexico as the National Color, with the unit inscription below the Coat of arms of Mexico and the official name of the country (Estados Unidos Mexicanos, United Mexican States) above it.  Nicaragua  Nicaragua's military colours under the Nicaraguan Armed Forces tend to follow a mix of the East German and US practice, as the Nicaraguan flag is treated as a National Colour. The unit colours are in red, with a gold outline of Nicaragua with the service, unit or branch insignia in the center. United States National, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. In the United States military, each branch has its own flag, an organizational color, sometimes also called a ceremonial flag. Each of these is 4 ft 4 in √ó 5 ft 6 in, some using 2.5-inch gold fringe during specific instances. The ceremonial flag is paraded with a National Color of equal dimensions in a color guard, with gold fringe as necessary. The National Color is never dipped in salute, but remains vertical at all times, while the organizational colors and any guidons are dipped as necessary. When the National Color is not cased, all persons salute the Colors. The finial is a nickel or chrome-plated spearhead, though the Navy uses different finials on occasion. Each service attaches campaign/battle streamers, sometimes known as battle honors, for actions in which the service as a whole has taken part. These can either be war service streamers, which are in the colors of the appropriate campaign medal and have the name of the campaign embroidered; or unit citation streamers, which have the name of the action embroidered and signify that the unit's performance in a specific action has been worthy of special mention. Units are also permitted to wear streamers of overseas awards they may have been presented with. These streamers are in the colors of the appropriate medal ribbon. The streamers are 3 ft √ó 2.75 in. The Army, for instance, currently has 178 service streamers,U.S. Army Press Release, Army to award campaign participation credit and streamers for global war on terror . Retrieved 16 August 2006. embroidering the name of each battle on each, as does the Air Force. The Marine Corps and Navy instead embroider award devices onto streamers to consolidate them, having 62 and 34, respectively. = United States Army = The 130th Engineer Brigade, its subordinate units and their colors. In the Army, most regiments, battalions of regiments, and separate battalions also have a stand of colors. The first is the National Color, which is a 36 in √ó 48 in version of the national flag trimmed with a 2.5 in wide gold fringe, and is the equivalent of the Queen's Colour in the British Army. The second is the Organizational Color, which is the equivalent of the Regimental Color; this is the same dimensions as the National Color, but is of a single color representing the branch of the service that the unit is from; each branch also has its own fringe color, which the Organizational Color is trimmed with. In the centre of the Color is the eagle from the Great Seal of the United States, but with the regimental coat of arms in the shield. The eagle has in its beak a scroll bearing the regimental motto, with the crest of the regiment's coat of arms above it and the regiment's name below. Attached to the Organizational Color will be the campaign and unit citation streamers awarded to the individual unit ‚Äì these are equivalent to the battle honors embroidered directly onto the colors of British and Commonwealth units. The Organizational Color was carried in lieu of a National Color until shortly before the Civil War, when the Stars and Stripes became the National Color.. Retrieved 16 August 2006. Civil War era units sometimes carried alternative Organizational Colors based on their home state flags or of other designs. = United States Marine Corps = A Marine color guard dips the Marine Flag for the national anthem. U.S.Naval Infantry Battalion Flag In the Marine Corps, each battalion-sized unit or larger maintains a set of colors. The organizational color identical to the Marine Corps battle color, excepting that the scroll will have the unit's name instead of \\"United States Marine Corps\\". It will also bear the streamers authorized to the unit, or scarlet and gold tassels if none are authorized. Fringe is generally not seen on the National Colors when carried by Marine Corps unit (the exception being indoor parades). Instead, a red, white, and blue tassel is used to decorate. = United States Navy = Prior to Executive Order 10812 of 24 April 1959, the United States Navy used the U.S. Naval Infantry Battalion Flag as its unofficial colors. While the Navy uses a number of maritime flags, such as the Ensign and Jack of the United States, the Flag of the United States Navy is normally seen only at ceremonies and parades. The display of streamers and fringe is consistent with that of the Marine Corps. = United States Naval Construction Force = When Naval Construction Battalions (Seabees) were first formed in 1942 the Naval Infantry Battalion Flag was mandated by Naval Regulation as the colors of the Naval Construction Force.FLAGS, PENNANTS & CUSTOMS,NTP 13 (B), NAVAL COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMAND, 4401 MASSACHUSETTS AVE., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20394-5460, section 17.11, p. 17‚Äì5 Each battalion-sized unit or larger maintains a set of colors. The organizational colors of each unit is identical, excepting that each will have the unit's name and number in white on the flag. The display of streamers authorized to the unit is consistent with that of the Marine Corps. = United States Air Force = U.S. Air Force (USAF) groups have the same National Color as the Army; the Organizational Color is ultramarine blue, with the group's coat of arms beneath the USAF crest, which is an eagle on a cloud background. The fringe is in gold. Uruguay Aside from the three state colours (the Flag of Uruguay, the Flag of Artigas and the Flag of the Treinta y Tres), the Uruguayan military also has regimental colours that differ per service and unit. The national colours have armed colour guards while the regimental colour has none at all. Venezuela In the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela, aside from the Flag of Venezuela as the National Colour, there are also Organizational Colours for each of the 6 service branches and the Ministerial Colour of the Ministry of Defence and Unit Colours, which differ per service branch and arm. Every military unit from the Ministry of Defense down to all individual units have a stand of colours like in the United Kingdom, but differ from the battalion to the service and the national level. The national flag, until the 1940s, served also as the unit state colour in the same manner as the National Colour of the United States Army and the State/Sovereign's Colour in the Commonwealth of Nations, and was based on the national flag but with the unit inscription replacing the stars in the centre in white lettering. The Venezuelan National Militia is the only service branch that uses a battle colour, similar to the flag of the Cuban July 26 Movement: the colour is red and black with the service name on it in white, and a separate colour is used for the service headquarters at the Montana Barracks in Caracas. Starting from July 2013 onward it was granted permission to use a 4th colour for its battalions: red with the eyes of the late President Hugo Ch√°vez and the inscription Chavez Vive (Chavez Lives On) below, topped with a scarlet star. Since 2014 the National Armed Forces uses two additional colours (the National Militia its 5th and 6th): that of the Supreme Commander's Colour, which is red bearing the portrait of the late President Ch√°vez surrounded by a wreath and the Armed Forces Motto (Independence and Socialist Fatherland, we will live on and triumph!) below and the inscription Supreme Commander of the Bolivarian Revolution (Comandante Supremo de la Revolucion Bolivariana) and the eight golden stars from the National Flag above it, plus the Memorial Colour of the Liberator and Father of the Nation (introduced in the summer of 2016), which is of the same colour facing but with the wreath containing the portrait of Simon Bolivar, the eight gold stars and his title above and the words Freedom, Sovereignty, Independence (Libertad, Soberania e Independencia) below the title, all in gold. The colors used on the Unit Colours are as follows: * Red: Ministry of Defence (formerly gray), Service units, Marine Corps, National Militia, Military Technical Academy, Presidential Honour Guard Brigade, Caracas HQ Battalion of the Ministry of Defence * Dark blue and red: Venezuelan Army HQ and units directing to Army HQ, Division and Brigade Colours * Yellow: Infantry, Jungle Infantry, Airborne Units * Orange: Rangers * Green: Army Engineers * Dark blue: Venezuelan Army Special Forces * Black: Armor * Burgundy red: Artillery and Air Defence Artillery * Gray: Logistics, National Armed Forces Communications and Electronics School * Navy blue: Navy * Ultramarine blue: Air Force (formerly light green) * Maroon: National Guard * Dark blue and white: Bolivarian Military University of Venezuela, Military Academy of the Bolivarian Army and Armed Forces Health Sciences Academy * Light blue and white: Venezuelan Naval Academy * White: Venezuelan Army military high schools =Asia= Cambodia In Cambodia, the Colours of the Military and other uniformed institutions follow Chinese (Taiwanese) and French practice. It is basically a large version of the Flag of Cambodia with the unit name below in white in the bottom blue stripe. People's Republic of China Army flag of the People's Republic of China The People's Liberation Army is the overall body for the entire armed forces of the People's Republic of China, and is represented by a single flag, which serves as a ceremonial colour for all regiments and larger formations. This is based on the national flag, but has instead of the four smaller gold stars the Chinese characters for the numerals '8' and '1', which stands for the 1 August, which was the date in 1927 that the PLA was founded. When paraded, the flag is fringed with gold, and is mounted on a red and gold pole. However, each branch of the PLA has its own flag, based on the Army Flag, but are not taken out on public parades except with the same gold fringe as the latter: *Ground forces: This is the Army Flag with the lower 40% coloured green. *Navy: This is the Army flag except that the lower 40% has three blue and two white horizontal stripes of equal width. *Air Force: This is the Army Flag with the lower 40% coloured air force blue. *Rocket Forces: This is the Army Flag with the lower 40% being a gold stripe. *Banners of the PLA Individual unit colours based on the PLA service colour would only come in a test basis beginning 2018, when mobile contingents of units of the Northern Theater Command who took part in the joint military exercise \\"Vostok 2018\\" with the Russian Armed Forces carried red colours with the unit name on the white fringe nearest the flagpole. Test battle colours were formerly given out to the People's Armed Police in recent years before the practice was adopted by the PLA Ground Forces on an experimental period. During the 1 October 2019 civil military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, a mobile colour guard unit debuted after many years the garrison colours awarded to every PLA formation and agency, which are red with the formation or agency name in Mandarin Chinese in white or gold lettering (but without the white fringe), with some colours bearing additional inscriptions bearing either battle honours or decorations awarded to the formation or agency concerned. Republic of China Army flag of the Republic of China The army of the Republic of China (Taiwan) also has a single flag that it uses, which is red, with a banner of the Blue Sky with a White Sun in the centre. It has a red flagpole with silver spearhead finial and red tassels immediately underneath. Individual units use a variation of the Army Flag as their own identifying Colour; this features a white strip next to the hoist, which has the unit's name in black characters, as well as a golden fringe (as is the case since 1961 for all units of the Republic of China Armed Forces, but since 1947 were limited only to Army units above the regimental level). The Army Honor Guard color is in gold with the unit coat of arms in the center. The Republic of China Navy's colors were red but with the seal of the Navy in a dark blue canton in the center until the 1980s, the honor guard company's colours only use both dark blue and the Navy seal, which are the same colours used today in other ROCN units. For the Republic of China Marine Corps, its unit battle colors, since 1960, mirrors that of the USMC but since the 1980s the unit name is on the white stripe near the hoist (just as the rest of the armed forces, formerly it was on a scroll similar to the USMC's). The colors used by the Republic of China Air Force are in sky blue with the air force seal in the center (formerly it was red with the sky blue canton featuring the coat of arms, the old design only used today by the honor guard). Units of the Republic of China Military Police, formerly using a blue color, now use a brown color with the ROCMP arms. Units reporting to the Ministry of National Defense sport an orange colour with the coast arms of the Ministry in the center. Garrison colors are in blue with the Kuomintang emblem, a wheat wreath and 3 interlocked circles in yellow, red and blue respectively. Reserve units carry a red color while the Taiwan Reserve uses a green one. Only the following military academies sport their colors as the ROCAF color is used by the Republic of China Air Force Academy: * Republic of China Military Academy * Republic of China Naval Academy In all events whenever the ROCAF is involved, the ROC flag is used as the National Color. Indonesia In Indonesia, the Colours of the Military, Police and other uniformed institutions are known as ''''', which its practice follow US models. The Panji-panji is carried and escorted by a Colour guard known as \\"Pataka\\", an abbreviation from Pasukan Tanda Kehormatan in Indonesian. = National Colour and Service Colours = The Indonesian Navy flag During graduation and passing out parades, whenever the enlistment or commissioning pledge is taken, the flag of Indonesia is used as a national colour. Mostly seen in parades are the service colours of the Indonesian National Armed Forces or TNI, the Indonesian National Police and the Municipal Police Units (known as the ). Within the TNI, service colours exist for all three service branches. means the military/service colours in Indonesian. * Indonesian National Armed Forces Tri-Service Colour: Red with coat of arms on the observe and the national emblem on the reverse * Indonesian National Police Colour: Black * Municipal Police Colour: Dark blue * Indonesian Army Colour: Green with coat of arms on the obverse * Indonesian Navy Colour: Dark blue with coat of arms on the obverse * Indonesian Air Force Colour: Sky blue with coat of arms on the obverse = Colours of commands and below = An Indonesian Army battalion colour guard and are terms used to identify colours below the command or service specialty level within the Armed Forces, National Police and Municipal Police. The former are for battalion/squadron level units and military territorial commands or equivalents, the latter for brigades/regiments, divisions/regional commands and service specialty and operational commands. They share a common design: the unit heraldic arms is featured in the observe while the emblem of its reporting formation is featured in the reverse side. Within the TNI, Police and Municipal Police, the specialty colors are: * Green: Infantry, Army Corps of Engineers, Regional Military Commands, Operational and Administrative Commands, Agencies and Departments * Red: Army Strategic Reserve Command, Army Special Force battalions and brigades * Black: Armor and Cavalry, Air Force Infantry, Raider Infantry (Airborne and Mechanized units inclusive), Municipal Police, Police * Brown: Artillery and Air Defense Artillery * Gray: Logistics, Military Police, Army Services * Navy blue: Navy * Ultramarine blue: Air Force * Maroon: Mobile Brigade Corps (Police) * Magenta: Marine Corps * Violet: Army Aviation Command  Democratic People's Republic of Korea  The KPA's first flag, used in 1948. The KPA's flag from 1992 to 1993. Since this flag's retirement in 1993, the KPA has not had its own dedicated flag, but the 1992 design has been reinstated only as a ceremonial colour for guards units but retaining the arms and motto from the earlier flag of 1948 The Korean People's Army is the overall body for the entire armed forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Until 1993 the KPA was, following the example of the PLA in China, represented by a single flag, which served as a ceremonial colour for all regiments, educational institutions and larger formations. The colour is on the basis of the national flag but with the national emblem replacing the star and on parades the colours were surrounded by gold fringe. The gold lettering in Hangul was until 1992 \\"For the unification and independence of the motherland and the people\\" (), replaced by the current motto \\"For the unification and independence of the motherland, and the freedom and happiness of the people\\" (). In 1993, as part of the 40th anniversary of the conclusion of the Korean War and the 45th since the founding of the DPRK, the old color was replaced by the designs currently seen today in major holiday parades. All the colours share the same reverse with the emblem of the Worker's Party of Korea in gold and, save for the Worker-Peasant Red Guards, have identical gold letting in Hangul which states \\"Revolutionary armed forces of the Workers' Party of Korea, Korean People's Army [unit name] / No.425 unit (in ceremonies)\\" (), the 425 number honoring the date (25 April) of the 1932 foundation of the People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Army, whose lineage is continued by the current service, but with the same colours as in the observe, which also shows the 4.25 mark in gold numbering. The Guards units also have its badge beneath the 4.25 mark. These colours are in gold fringe when brought out in public parades in Pyongyang, the national capital, and during state visits by the honor guards of the Supreme Guard Command, which is an inter- service formation unlike the rest of the command whose personnel are drawn from the Ground Forces. The 1948 and 1992 design colours, since the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the conclusion of the Korean War in 2013, have been brought out only by guards units and KPA battalions sporting historical dress uniforms of the 1940s and early 1950s, the 1992 colors have a gold Guards Badge outline in the reverse to denote Guards status of the unit's colour while the colours only use the 1948 arms and motto instead of the current one. * Ground Forces 1993‚Äì97 and 2012‚Äìpresent (also used as unofficial flag of the entire KPA): Colour in national flag colors but with KPA emblem in gold (sheaves of wheat and a stylized dam with a red star surrounded by a gold circle with wreath below) and gold Hangul motto in the obverse ** Ground Forces 1997‚Äì2011 (also used as unofficial flag of the entire KPA): Colour in national flag colors but with KPA emblem in gold and gold Hangul motto on the top and bottom blue stripes reading \\"Let us defend the headquarters of the revolution headed by the great Comrade Kim Jong Il with our lives!\\" () with the name of Kim Jong Il slightly enlarged, gold motto also used in the flags of the other branches * Air Force 1993‚Äìpresent: Emblem of KPA with wings (emblem updated in 2012), top large half in air force blue and small bottom half dark blue, with 6 alternating stripes (3 dark blue, 3 air force blue) below the emblem, formerly gold wings and a gold star above the emblem * Navy 1993‚Äìpresent: Emblem of KPA with gold four anchor above, bicolor of white and navy blue with 5 alternating stripes between the large stripes (3 dark blue, 2 white) * Strategic Forces (present colour): Green with emblem of the KPA and a larger wreath above a stylized top of a globe, with light yellow stripes below the globe * Special Operations Forces: Dark Blue with emblem of the KPA and a larger wreath, with the Big Dipper below the 4.25 mark * Revolutionary military schools: Red with KPA emblem and Hangul motto in gold lettering above and below * Worker-Peasant Red Guards: Red with service emblem (red star and gold wreath) in the center and the Hangul motto in gold above and below the emblem in the observe, and name of the service in Hangul below the WPK emblem in the reverse, from 1997 to 2011 the gold Hangul motto read \\"Let's us defend the leadership of the revolution led by Comrade Kim Jong Il with our lives!\\"  Republic of Korea  The traditions of military unit and branch colours of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces are mostly derived from the United States practice with the Flag of South Korea treated as a National Colour, with latter traditions infused from the other armed forces of the United Nations Command that fought in the Korean War of 1950-53. Today each of the ROKAF's service branches have branch regimental colours, which are carried by colour guards following a mix of Western traditions. The colours are as follows: * Army: Blue and white with service emblem * Navy: Blue with white canton (yin-yang with crossed anchors) ** Marine Corps: Scarlet with service emblem * Air Force: Air force/sky blue with gold service emblem In major holiday parades two additional colours are paraded as part of the national colour guard. * Honorary Colour of the Armed Forces and Ministry of National Defense: Red with armed forces emblem * Colour of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the MND and ROKAF: Purple Unit and specialty colours follow a mix of the Western models with influences from the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, sharing since the 1990s a common design with the unit name in Hangul below the emblem (in the Navy, the unit/command name is on a white scroll below). * Colours of units under the ROK Army ** Regimental, brigade, division and corps colours: Army Colour with unit DUI/emblem replacing the service arms ** Infantry: Blue ** Armour: Yellow ** Artillery and Missile Command: Burgundy red ** Air defense artillery: Green ** Engineers: Light blue ** Special operations: Black ** Logistics and service support: White/Orange ** Reserve units: Dark blue ** Army aviation: Blue * Colours of units under the ROK Navy ** Fleet forces and other commands: Navy blue ** Marine Corps: Scarlet ** Service support: White ** Educational and training institutions: White/Navy blue * All ROK Air Force formations: Sky blue In addition, the traditional guard unit under the 3rd Infantry Division of the ROKA carries replica colours similar to those used during the Imperial era, which are in the Chinese manner and are mounted on lance poles. They are only brought out during state visits to the republic and on major holidays. Philippines Philippine military colours are the Flag of the Philippines as the National Colour, the Organizational Colours, and the Unit Regimental Colour. The Flag of the Philippines is the National Colour of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, but unlike the US colour has no markings on the flag. The Organizational Colours are the flags of the AFP's four Major Service Commands while the Unit Regimental Colour differs per service arm and unit. Like the US, it also has 2nd order guidons for companies and troops, but these are also based on the Spanish military guidons and banners, not on the American ones, reflecting the long history of the military establishment here. These guidons are therefore not swallow tailed save for the PMA, the Philippine Army's Escort and Security Btn and some other units under the Philippine Army. Thailand The Unit Colour of the 1st Engineer Bataillion, King's Guard of the Royal Thai Army during the funeral procession of Princess Galyani Vadhana in 2008. Each unit of the Royal Thai Armed Forces is given a colour called the \\"Thong Chai Chalermphol\\" () or Victory Colours. These are presented to each unit personally by the King of Thailand. The flags are divided into four different designs, for: Royal Thai Army, Royal Thai Navy, Royal Thai Air Force and King's Guard units. Before their presentation the colours are ceremonially blessed in a religious ceremony attended by Buddhist monks and other high ranking dignitaries inside the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok. During the ceremony amidst the chanting of the monks, the King will personally hammer the brass nails into the staff of each colour using a silver hammer. Each colour contains about 32‚Äì35 nails, in which the cloth is attached to the wooden staff. Within the same ceremony, the King will also take a strand of his own hair and conceal it within a compartment at the top of the staff, which is closed by a round silver screw top. The King will also attach each colour with its own ceremonial Buddha image, and bless each colour with holy water. The ceremony is steeped in Buddhist and Brahmic heritage, it symbolizes and cements the King's role as Chief Kshatriya (‡∏Å‡∏©‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏¢‡πå) or Warrior ruler of his realm. It also emphasizes his constitutional role as Head and Chief of the Thai Armed Forces (‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏û‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢: Chomthap Thai). These colours are similar to the Flag of Thailand and therefore are treated like the State Colours of the Commonwealth, but are not lowered to the ground but above it to the tune of Sansoen Phra Barami (the Royal Anthem) when salutes are rendered by these Colours to the Thai Royal Family (most especially the King and Queen) in all military events that they attend.  Vietnam  Similar to Chinese practice, the Flag of Vietnam is used as a National Colour by all formations of battalion level above within the People's Army of Vietnam. It is fringed in gold and when used in ceremonies often has the gold motto (\\"determination to win\\") at the top right corner of the colour near the hoist, and with any decorations and/or medals attached to it. =Commonwealth of Nations= The Colours of the Infantry and Standards of the Cavalry are a set of large flags, unique to each regiment, that the ordinary soldier would be able to identify straight away. United Kingdom =Line infantry and foot guards= Queen's Colour of the 1st Battalion, the Grenadier Guards. In contrast with those of the line infantry regiments, the Queen's Colours of Foot Guards regiments are crimson, and it is their Regimental Colours that are based on the Union Flag. Foot Guards regiments also emblazon the same honours (from all conflicts, including both World Wars) on both colours. In regiments of infantry of the British Army and the armies of other Commonwealth countries, each battalion carries two colours, which collectively are called a stand. These are large flags, usually , and mounted on a half pike which is long; the King's/Queen's Colour is usually a version of the country's national flag, often trimmed with gold fabric, and with the regiment's insignia placed in the centre. The Regimental Colour is a flag of a single colour, usually the colour of the uniform facings (collar/lapels and cuffs) of the regiment, again often trimmed and with the insignia in the centre. Most regiments that are designated as 'royal' regiments (that is either have the word 'Royal' or the sponsorship of a royal personage in their name) have a navy blue Regimental Colour. Irish regiments, today the Royal Irish Regiment, have a dark green Regimental Colour. The colours of the five regiments of Foot Guards have the pattern of the line infantry reversed, with the Queen's Colour of each of the 1st Battalions being crimson with the regimental insignia, a royal crown and honours and the Regimental Colour a variation of the Union Flag with the battle honours embroidered. The Queens' Colours of any additional battalions from these regiments (currently held by the 3 incremental companies from the 3 senior regiments) feature a Union Flag canton at the top corner. =Additional Colours= Additional Colours of the 3rd Battalion Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of Wellington's). *The Grenadier, Coldstream and Scots Guards each have at least one State Colour; this is usually crimson with various regimental devices and honours, and the Royal Cypher at the corners of it. They are only used by Guards of Honour from any unit from these regiments, not found by the Queen's Guard, mounted on State occasions when The Queen is present. They are only lowered to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and on State occasions only when the Queen is present, even if the Guard of Honour is mounted in honour of some other personage. The colour design is larger than the normal colours of the Guards Division used in ceremonies. *The 1st Battalion, Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, as the linear descendant, bears the Third Colour initially born by the 2nd Regiment of Foot, later renamed the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) which, for one reason or another, was never taken away from the regiment in the 18th century when new regulations on colours were implemented. *The 1st Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers bears the Drummer's Colour awarded after the Battle of Wilhelmsthal to the 5th Regiment of Foot, (later The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) of which it is the direct descendant. *The 3rd Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of Wellington's), as the linear descendant, carries the honorary Queen's and Regimental Colours that were given to the 76th Regiment of Foot by the Honourable East India Company following their actions at Delhi and Allyghur. *The Royal Highland Fusiliers 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland carries the Assaye Colour awarded as an honorary colour to the 74th Regiment of Foot following the Battle of Assaye, which is paraded every year on Assaye Day. * The Honourable Artillery Company has both a stand of Colours (Queen's and Regimental) and Guns. The latter are also regarded as colours and accorded the same compliments just as the Royal Artillery regard their guns as their Colours. =Rifle regiments= By tradition, rifle regiments do not carry colours; this goes back to their formation, when they were used as skirmishers and sharpshooters. While individual units may have had banners or pennants to distinguish themselves from other units, regiments as a whole never needed a full stand of Colours. Today, the two rifle regiments in the British Army, The Rifles and the Royal Gurkha Rifles carry their battle honours on their drums, while the Royal Green Jackets also had theirs inscribed on their cap badge; this tradition is maintained by The Rifles, who wear the Maltese Cross badge of the Royal Green Jackets, inscribed with the regimental honours, as the belt badge. In place of a Regimental Colour, the Gurkhas carry the Queen's Truncheon. The Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment was the first non-British regiment to receive Truncheons when they were awarded to that unit in 2017. In India, Colours or Banners are given instead of Truncheons, following Russian practice, to all the rifle and scout infantry regiments by the President of India. =Colours in the cavalry regiments= In the British Army's cavalry units, the Queen's Cavalry Standard and the Regimental Standard (for the heavy cavalry) and the Queen's Cavalry Guidons and Regimental Guidons (for the light cavalry) are the equivalents to the line infantry colours. The Queen's Standard is crimson with the Royal coat of arms and cypher, plus the regimental honours, while the Regimental (Squadron/Union) Standard has an adaptable background colour per unit (the colour is sometimes scarlet) and includes sometimes the Union Badge below the crown and the Royal Cypher at the sides of the badge, with the unit honours below. The light cavalry Guidon is swallow-tailed and includes the regimental coat of arms and honours. Before the 1950s, however, Timpani in the drumhorses (and later snare, bass and tenor drums in the dismounted bands) carried the regimental honours and insignia of the light cavalry regiments. For dragoon guards regiments, the sequence is mixed, since these regiments have a Queen's Cavalry Standard and Regimental Guidons. The Household Cavalry has the following unique colours: * The Life Guards: Queen's Cavalry Standard only * The Blues and Royals: Queen's Cavalry Standard, Regimental Guidon =Embellishments= Woven onto the colours are battle honours; the Queen's Colour has honours from the First World War and Second World War, while the Regimental Colour has honours from other campaigns. The Regimental Colour will also have other distinctions, including antecedent emblems and unique honours; one significant example is the Sphinx emblem carried by regiments who took part in the Egypt campaign of 1801. If the regiment has more than a single battalion, then there will be identifying marks on the colours to show which battalion they belong to. There are various other embellishments that can be added to the colours on various occasions: *On anniversaries of various battle honours, and certain other events, a laurel wreath is added to the top of the pike. *Battle honour equivalents awarded by foreign countries may be added to the colours, subject to permission being given by the head of state. In the Commonwealth, three infantry battalions are permitted to display the four-foot-long blue streamer that signifies the Presidential Unit Citation/Distinguished Unit Citation, which is the highest collective award given by the United States of America: **2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry **3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment **6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment In the UK, 41 Commando, Royal Marines and the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment were also awarded the PUC and permitted to display the streamer of their regimental colours. Because of their importance to the regiment, prior to a new stand of colours being presented, they are consecrated. =Royal Hospital, Chelsea= The Royal Hospital, Chelsea had neither colours nor other distinctive device during its entire history, until 2002 when The Queen presented the Hospital with the Sovereign's Mace. This is now paraded by a party of In-Pensioners at all of the Royal Hospital's ceremonial events. =Royal Marines= The Corps of Royal Marines has a single pattern Queen's Colour, which is the Union Flag with the foul anchor and the reigning sovereign's cypher interlaced in the centre. Above is a scroll with the single battle honour Gibraltar surmounted by St Edward's Crown. Below is the globe (which represents the many Battle Honours the Royal Marines had earned) surrounded by a laurel wreath (which represents the Battle of Belle Isle) and below this is a scroll with the Corps' motto. Each of the four commandos (the battalion-sized formations that make up the bulk of the corps) has a Queen's Colour, with the only difference being the colour of the cords and tassels. Each commando also has its own Regimental Colour. The Regimental Colour is a dark blue flag (because the Corps is classed as a 'royal regiment') with a small Union Flag at the pike head. The Colour carries similar central embellishments as the Queen's Colour, with the exception that the cypher of George IV replaces that of the reigning monarch and the unit numeral is below. The Royal Cypher is at the other corners. The Regimental Colours also have the coloured cords and tassels, which are gold combined with the following colours: *40 Commando: Light blue *42 Commando: White *43 Commando: Old gold and scarlet *45 Commando: Red The former 41 Commando was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for its service in the Korean War, and was thus permitted to carry the streamer on its Regimental Colour. *Colours of the Royal Marines =The Royal Navy= Queen's Colour of the Royal Navy The Colours of Her Majesty's ships in the Royal Navy consist of: * a White Ensign (worn at the stern, or from the gaff or main yardarm when at sea); * a Union Jack (worn at the ship's jackstaff at the bow when not underway or when the ship is dressed); * a Masthead pennant (worn at the masthead, except when displaced by an admiral's flag or commodore's broad pennant). In addition, each principal command in the Royal Navy also has its own Queen's Colour which is a variation of the White Ensign, with its dimensions altered to mirror those of the Colours of infantry regiments. In the centre is the Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch within the Garter, surmounted by the crown. Unlike the Colours of regiments in the Army, every Queen's Colour of the Royal Navy is identical. The following units hold a Queen's Colour of the Royal Navy: * Naval Aviation Command (ACOS(AV), HMS Heron) * Submarine Command (CAPTFASFLOT, HMS Neptune) * Fleet (CINCFLEET HQ) * Britannia Royal Naval College * Surface Flotilla (MWS, ) * Royal Naval Reserve (COMMARRES, ) The Royal Fleet Auxiliary also holds a Queens Colour, unique for a civilian organisation. It is a variation of the RFA's Blue Ensign, with the dimensions altered to mirror the Royal Navy Queen's Colour. It has the same Royal Cypher in the centre. =The Royal Air Force= Queen's Colour of the Royal Air Force RAF Colours are made of sky blue silk and measure approximately 36\\" √ó 36\\". The following colours have been awarded: *RAF College, Cranwell, approved 27 December 1947, presented 6 July 1948. *The RAF in the UK, approved 27 December 1947, presented, 16 May 1951. *No. 1 School of Technical Training RAF, approved 27 December 1947, presented 25 July 1952. *RAF Regiment, presented 17 March 1953. *Near East Air Force, presented 14 October 1960, laid up 31 May 1976. *Far East Air Force, presented 13 July 1961, laid up 30 January 1972. *Central Flying School, presented 26 June 1969. *RAF Germany, presented 16 September 1970, laid up 27 June 1993. *Royal Auxiliary Air Force, presented 12 June 1989. *RAF Halton, presented 31 October 1997. *Royal Air Force Regiment, presented July 2017. The Queen's Colour for the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom is a variation of the RAF Ensign with its dimensions altered. The RAF Roundel is moved to the lower fly, with its place in the centre again taken by the Royal Cypher surmounted by the crown. Other colours feature the unit's badge in the centre with the Royal Cypher and crown in the first quarter. The RAF's Squadron Standards are its counterpart to the Regimental Colours. They are in air force blue with a gold fringe surrounding it, with the Squadron insignia and honours. Australia, Canada and New Zealand George VI presents the King's Colours to the Royal Canadian Navy at a ceremony in Beacon Hill Park, Victoria, in 1939 The Australian National Flag (top) was the basis of the Australian White Ensign (bottom). Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, presents new Colours to the Royal Regiment of Canada and Toronto Scottish Regiment at Varsity Stadium in Toronto, 5 November 2009 The naval and air forces of all three of these countries also have similar Colours based on their own ensigns. Rules stipulated by the Canadian Department of Defence state that the First, or Senior Colours symbolizes the unit's loyalty to the Crown; authorization to possess a Queen's Colour may only be granted, and the Colour presented by the Queen or her vice-regal representative. The design based on the flag of Canada reflects the custom established for infantry line regiments in the mid-18th century, when the Sovereign's Colour was based on the national flag, as was the practice in British and French units in Canada.Department of National Defence; Cadet Instructors Cadre; pg. 33 =Navy= *Royal Australian Navy: The Queen's Colour of the RAN is the Australian White Ensign ‚Äì it is a reverse of the Australian national flag (white with blue stars), with the Royal Cypher and Garter band positioned between the Commonwealth Star and the stars representing the Southern Cross. (See former Colours at Naval Chapel, Garden Island NSW.) The RAN possesses two Colours, the first is the Fleet Colour held on behalf of the fleet units by Fleet Headquarters, . The second, known as the Establishment Colour, is held by on behalf of the shore establishments. *Royal Canadian Navy: The Queen's Naval Colour is a variation of the Canadian Naval Ensign (which used to be the Canadian Forces naval jack) ‚Äì it is white, with the Canadian flag in the canton, the cypher from the Queen's personal flag for the Commonwealth (a crowned \\"E\\" surrounded by a wreath of roses) in the centre, and the symbol of the navy in the lower fly. The edge of the Colour is trimmed in gold. Until 1979 the RCN possessed two identical colours: one for the Atlantic fleet and one for the Pacific fleet. Since then, a single Colour has been held at Naval Service Headquarters. *Royal New Zealand Navy: Since 1968 the RNZN Queen's Colour is a variant of the Naval Ensign of New Zealand ‚Äì itself the Flag of New Zealand but in white, with the Royal Cypher and Garter band situated near the Southern Cross. =Army= * Australian infantry battalions formed just prior to or during World War 1 had a pair (a stand) of colours, being a King's Colour based on the Union Flag and a separate Regimental Colour emblazoned with the battalion number and its colour patch (shoulder badge). Battle Honours were also emblazoned on the Regimental Colour. These customs followed the British tradition. Some of those World War 1 battalions were amalgamated prior to or during World War 2. For example, the 57th Battalion amalgamated with the 60th Battalion in 1930, forming the 57th/60th Battalion which saw action in the South West Pacific campaigns during World War 2. The 57th/60th Battalion did not have its own colours, but by dint of history inherited both sets of colours (both stands) from the 57th and the 60th. In accordance with the order of battle the 57th/60th wore the colour patch of the 57th on its uniforms, but they still paraded and presented the colours of both the 57th and the 60th. The Queen gave permission in 1960 for the battle honours from World War 2 (South-West Pacific 1943‚Äì45, Liberation of Australian New Guinea, Commando Road, etc.) to be emblazoned on (what were by then and remain) the Queen's Colours, rather than on the Regimental Colours which were already emblazoned with honours from World War 1 (The Somme, Passchendaele, Villers-Bretonneux, Amiens, etc.). A similar situation occurred with the amalgamation in 1942 of the 58th Battalion and the 59th Battalion to form the 58th/59th Battalion, which wore the colour patch of the 58th Battalion on its uniforms but inherited and paraded both stands of colours from the 58th Battalion and 59th Battalion. The 57th/60th Battalion and the 58th/59th Battalion were disbanded soon after World War 2 and the colours were laid up in the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne where they are on display in the Crypt. The Shrine and other war memorials and churches around Australia display many other stands of battalion colours that have been laid up in their care, such as St Stephens Church, Sydney. * While the colours of the Australian Army infantry regiments follow the British tradition, starting in the 1960s colours based on the Australian national flag are now used as the Queen's Colour. Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons ‚Äì flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by cavalry, lancer, light horse and mounted infantry units. The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units. Guidons are also carried by aviation units. Only the Royal Australian Artillery uses guns rather than flags as the colours. Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, but have Standards or Banners instead. The Royal Military College, Duntroon also has an additional colour, the Sovereign's Banner, carried yearly by the RMC's Champion Company from the Corps of Staff Cadets formed from the best cadet company for the year, which on parades takes precedence over the other companies as the Sovereign's Company. The Army itself since 2001 has a banner known as the Army Banner, carried on all events of the service (as the Army is the protector of the traditions of the Flag of Australia, and thus does not have its own service colour). It is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial. The Army Banner bears the Australian Coat of Arms on the obverse, with the dates \\"1901‚Äì2001\\" in gold in the upper hoist. The reverse bears the \\"rising sun\\" badge of the Australian Army, flanked by seven campaign honours on small gold-edged scrolls: South Africa, World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya- Borneo, South Vietnam, Peacekeeping and East Timor. It was presented to the Army in celebration of its 2001 centennial year. * In the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Armoured Corps (RCAC) regiments designated horse guards and dragoon guards, along with the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, have regimental standards. RCAC standards have a crimson field and the CSOR standard has a tan field. RCAC regiments other than horse guards and dragoon guards have crimson regimental guidons. Each battalion of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, except those of rifle regiments, has a stand of two colours: a queen's colour and a regimental colour. For foot guards, the queen's colours have a crimson field, and the regimental colours are based on the Canadian national flag. For other infantry regiments, the queen's colours are based on the national flag, and the regimental colours are of the regimental facing colour. Only the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery uses guns for its colours. The rifle regiments share the traditions of the former British rifle regiments of having their battle honours carried on their drums. The Royal Canadian Engineers, which serves all three services and the Special Forces, do not have colours but have the motto \\"Ubique\\", Latin for Everywhere, on their hat badges and other insignia to represent their service everywhere. *Only the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, the sole infantry regiment of the New Zealand Army, has a stand of Colours, with the Queen's Colour now based on the Flag of New Zealand, with the Union Flag canton carrying the regimental insignia, and the Regimental Colour being royal blue due to its status as a royal regiment. Stands of Colours are present in the regiment's two regular and three reserve battalions. Until 1964, when the New Zealand infantry was reorganized into a single regiment, all the reserve infantry regiments also carried their own colours. The sole armoured regiment, Queen Alexandra's Mounted Rifles, carries a guidon in the traditions of cavalry units raised in New Zealand since the 19th century. =Air Force= *Royal Australian Air Force: The Queen's Colour of the RAAF is the Royal Australian Air Force Ensign. It is similar to that of the RAF ‚Äì however, in addition to the RAAF roundel, which is in the lower fly, it has the Commonwealth Star in the lower hoist and the stars of the Southern Cross in the upper fly, with the Royal Cypher in the centre. The flag has a border of golden wattle as well as golden fringe. *Royal Canadian Air Force: The Queen's colour of the RCAF is different from that of other Commonwealth air forces in that it is not based on the ensign but instead is similar to the Queen's colours of infantry regiments: it is a silk national flag of Canada with a red circlet on the maple leaf inscribed with the name of the command, surrounding the royal cipher, and ensigned with the royal crown. Uniquely among Commonwealth air forces, the Canadian air force also has a Command Colour, analogous to an infantry regimental colour. This is light blue with the command badge in the centre and a maple leaf in each corner, stems inward. Also like army units, squadrons with 25 years or more of active service receive unit colours with battle honours surrounding the unit badge on the same light blue background edged with flowers. Sri Lanka President's Colour of Sri Lanka When Sri Lanka declared itself a republic in 1972 the units that had a Queen's Colour retired them. These were replaced by the new President's Colour, which was first awarded in 1972. The following colours have been awarded: *Sri Lanka Army **Regiments ***Sri Lanka Light Infantry ‚Äì 1978 ***Gemunu Watch ‚Äì 1980 ***Gajaba Regiment ‚Äì 2007 ***Sri Lanka Armoured Corps ***Sri Lanka Artillery **Establishments ***Army Training Centre ‚Äì 1972, laid up 20 August 1992 ***Sri Lanka Military Academy ‚Äì 1997 *Sri Lanka Air Force **Sri Lanka Air Force ‚Äì 1976 **SLAF Regiment ‚Äì 2009 **Squadrons ***No. 1 Flying Training Wing ‚Äì 2001 ***No. 2 Heavy Transport Squadron ‚Äì 2009 ***No. 4 (VIP) Helicopter Squadron ‚Äì 2009 ***No. 9 Attack Helicopter Squadron ‚Äì 2009 ***No. 10 Fighter Squadron ‚Äì 2009 **Stations ***SLAF Katunayake ‚Äì 2001 *Sri Lanka Navy **Commanders ***Admiral of the fleet Wasantha Karannagoda **Establishments ***Naval and Maritime Academy ‚Äì 2000 Regimental colours follow the British model, and the two light infantry regiments (Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment and Sri Lanka Rifle Corps) do not carry colours at all. Unlike the British Royal Artillery, the Sri Lanka Artillery carries a set of President's and Regimental Colours, the same case for the Sri Lanka Engineers. Unlike the Air Force which uses a single colour design similar to the RAF, the Navy sports unit and command colours in the same fashion as the Army.  India  Given its Commonwealth heritage as a former British possession, the Indian Armed Forces sports colors which are equivalent to those used in the British military. = Presidential Colours to service branches of the armed forces = Only the Navy and Air Force sport President's Service Colours which are their respective naval ensign and air force flag with an elephant at the bottom left end. = President's Colours/Standards/Guidons/Banners of military units = President's Colours (Standard and Guidon for mounted units of the Army and Air Force flying units and Banners for service arms and the light infantry) are awarded to distinguished units of the Armed Forces by the President of India, who is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, these are the equivalents to British regimental colours. In the Army, these colours carry the regimental/battalion insignia and any battle honours won by the unit. * Army ** Cavalry Standards ‚Äì per colour facing ** Cavalry Guidons ‚Äì same as standards ** Artillery and Air Defence Artillery Banners - burgundy red and blue ** Infantry Colours ‚Äì per respective colour facing ** Light Infantry and Rifle Banners ‚Äì same as regular infantry ** Service Corps Banners ‚Äì per respective colours * Navy ‚Äì dark blue * Air Force ‚Äì sky blue Malaysia The same format of Sovereign's and Regimental Colours also apply in Malaysia. The King's Colours and Regimental Colours of the Malaysian Armed Forces are the flags given by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in his responsibilities as Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and by the 8 other state monarchs, to units recognized as Royal units and to flags of large formations (the King's Colour) and to units now receiving their new regimental colours (the Unit Regimental Colour). The King's Colour is yellow with the national arms surrounded by paddy on the centre, thus Malaysia is one of only two Commonwealth countries, the other being Brunei, that does not use its national flag for use as a senior Colour (the flag is the senior colour of the entire Armed Forces establishment). The sides are emblazoned with the battle honours of the unit. On the canton the service emblem of either service of the Armed Forces (Army, Navy and Air Force) can be seen. The Regimental Colour, however, differs by service arm or branch (the latter case being used in the Army) and unit. Both flags have gold fringes surrounding them. These colours are only present in formal parades. During the Merdeka Parade and on Armed Forces Day on 21 September, as the armed services on parade do not wear their dress uniforms, only the 1st Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment, which wears dress uniforms, is present with its King's and Regimental Colours, but for the rest of the services on public parade the following order then applies: * Service Colour/Regimental Camp Flag * Flag of Malaysia (National Colour) * Colour of the Malaysian Armed Forces Singapore Singaporean military colours of the Singapore Armed Forces are divided today into Service State Colours and Unit Regimental Colours. Until 1997 there were also Service Regimental Colours and Unit State Colours. The Service State Colours are similar to the Flag of Singapore but differ per service, with the service emblem in the red field. But Regimental Colours are different, and they differ per unit or service arm (save for the flags of the Air Force and Navy that show their respective service colours instead and some SAF service-wide commands like the Military Police). Their common design is that of the regimental or command arms at the centre of the colour, which is in the colour of the unit uniform facings or service branch which it belongs. Both are gold fringed and are brought out on major occasions only. The former Unit State Colours carried the unit emblem or badge in the red field of the national flag. =Europe=  Belgium  Infantry units have a drapeau / vaandel, a square vertical tricolour of black, yellow, and red within a 15 mm wide gold border, the whole being 90 cm square. The names of battle honours for which the unit was cited are embroidered in gold in French on the obverse and in Dutch on the reverse, in straight lines.  Denmark  Guard Hussar Regiment's Colours Danish Navy, Army and Air Force units carry a unit colour () and for the Life Guards a battalion colour (), which measures 105 √ó 140 cm, former horse units a slightly smaller guidon.http://forsvaret.dk/ghr/om%20ghr/kendetegn/fane_estandart/Pages/default.aspx The flag is a variation of the Dannebrog, with a curvilinear white Dannebrog cross, called the Mantova cross, set with its centre about one-half the width of the hoist from the hoist edge. The royal cypher is embroidered in gold over the centre of the cross, the unit badge in gold in the upper hoist, and the unit number, name or both in gold in the lower hoist. Some regiments have additional marks in the upper fly. The Jyske Dragonregiment, for instance, has Prince Henrik's cipher in the upper fly. The finial is an ornate gold openwork spearhead with the royal cypher in the centre. Attached below the spearhead can be one or more campaign streamers (). The colour is decorated with a gold cord with two tassels and bordered with a thin strip of gold cord. The sleeve holding the colour to the pike is attached with ornamental nails, the first three of which represent the sovereign, the Fatherland, and the Union. Finland Units of Finnish Defence Forces have a single Colour. The Colours are either active or traditional. An active Colour belongs to a brigade or an equivalent unit in the FDF. A traditional Colour belongs to a battalion or a regiment that has formerly been separate but is now part of a brigade. The difference between an active and traditional Colour is the way of presenting them. The active Colour has always a guard of two officers, while a traditional Colour is borne without one. The military oath is always given in the presence of the active Colour of the unit. The Finnish military vexillology is a mixture of Scandinavian and Russian tradition. The Colours are usually modelled after Swedish regimental flags of the 17th century, but some units carry flags modelled after Russian or German colour traditions. The Colour often bears the emblem of the province where the unit is located with an appropriate symbol of the service branch. No battle honours were awarded for units during the Second World War but some units have battle honours from the Finnish Civil War. Units and institutions of the Finnish Defence Force which have not been awarded a colour of their own use the unadorned swallow- tailed Flag of Finland as their State Colour, and the oath of service for NCOs and volunteer enlisted personnel assigned to these are given in its presence.

File:PorPr-lippu.jpg|Colour of Pori Brigade has the blue and yellow colours of Satakunta, and the coats of arms of Satakunta and Finland Proper on its two sides.

The Kymi Jaeger Battalion follows the traditions of the 3rd Bicycle Battalion and carries that number on its colour, and the Order of the Cross of Liberty both as a streamer and as the point of the staff. File:I-SVP_flag.jpg|The traditional colour of It√§-Suomen Viestipataljoona (Eastern Finland Signals Battalion), part of Karelia Brigade, has the branch colours of signals corps: purple and gold. The device featuring Western Capercaillie is a throwback to the earlier designation as Central Finland Signals Battalion. The main device, the three lightning bolts, is symbolic of communication. File:7_Ohjuslaivue_lippu.jpg|The traditional Colour of the 7. Pintatorjuntalaivue (7th Surface Combat Flotilla) of the Coastal Navy features a blue Lion of Finland with a fish tail, striking with a trident. File:PvKvK- lippu.jpg|The Colour of the Finnish Defence Forces International Centre features a Lion of Finland holding a herald's staff in addition to the sword. The shade of blue of the colour is the same as in the flag of United Nations. File:Karjalan Lennoston lippu.svg|The Colour of the Karelian Air Command features, like all Finnish Air Force Colours, a swastika within a winged circle. The identifying device is a small coat of arms of Karelia France In January 1188, in a meeting between Henry II of England and Philip II of France, it was agreed that both would go on a crusade, and that Henry II would use a white cross and Philip II would use a red cross.\\"In January 1188 there was a meeting between Henry II and Phillip II under an old tree at Gisors on the border between France and Normandy. The meeting was attended also by Phillip of Alsace, the Count of Flanders. The two rivals agreed to stop the wars between them and swear to 'take the cross' (i.e. to go in a crusade). They also agreed to establish symbols to the different corps: white cross for the Plantagenet corps of Henry II, a red cross for the Capetian corps of Phillip II, and a green cross for the Flemish.\\" Joshua Prawer, A history of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (Hebrew, 3rd edition, vol. II, pp. 17‚Äì18) Later on, this usage was inverted, and the English took to using a red cross on white, and the French a white cross on red. =Background= As the use of regimental colours spread in Europe, the habit developed of using a symmetric white cross as the basis of the design of the French regimental flags, and by the 18th century almost every regiment had a white cross. The regiments were distinguished by the colours of the cantons. After the French Revolution and the appearance of the new Tricolore, crosses disappear in 1794 and various arrangements of the tricolour come into use. Napoleon standardizes first in 1804 to a white field chape-chausse of red and blue, and in 1812 to the modern French flag. Atop of the staff of colours of the Napoleonic army the Imperial Eagle (modelled after the Ancient Roman Aquila) was placed, which actually rose to be more important symbol of the regiment than colours itself.

This unit has inherited the flag and battle honours of the 1st Moroccan Spahis of the Army of Africa. The modern French Armed Forces are not officially considered to be the successors of the Royal Army and Navy, although many of their individual units trace their histories to before the foundation of the First Republic. Accordingly, battles fought and won by the Royal Army and Navy before the French Revolution (such as Patay, Fontenoy, Chesapeake, Porto Praya and so on) do not appear as battle honours on regimental colours. The names of battles of the old times, however, which are rightly still considered as most glorious by the modern French Army, are honoured by being given to ships or armoured vehicles, and remembered by anniversaries. As an example, the 1st Infantry Regiment, founded in 1479 during the reign of Louis XI, has fought a number of battles since the 15th century, but its battle honours are only recorded from 1792 onwards: *Valmy 1792 *Fleurus 1794 *Moeskirch 1800 *Biberach 1800 *Miliana 1842 *Guise 1914 *Verdun ‚Äì L'Yser 1916‚Äì1917 *La Somme 1916 *L'Ourcq 1918 *R√©sistance Berry 1944 *AFN 1952‚Äì1962. =Latest official regulations= The following official documents relate to the colours of the Land Army (arm√©e de Terre) : * recommendation (circulaire) 808 EMM/CAB of 5 December 1985 rules what sorts of units can be given colours, abiding to previous regulations of joint services; * decision 12350/SGA/DPMA/SHD/DAT of 14 September 2007 deals with the inscriptions of battle honours upon the flags and standards of the units of the Army, the Defence Health service and the Military Fuel Service;Bulletin officiel des arm√©es, 27, 9 novembre 2007 * government order of 19 November 2004 relates to the award of the AFN 1952‚Äì1962 battle honour to flags and standards of Army and Services units.(A) NORDEF0452926A, by Minister of Defence Mme Mich√®le Alliot-Marie. =Land Army in general= * Regimental colours of units which are traditionally on foot, such as Infantry regiments of the line, Marine Infantry, Foreign Legion Infantry, Paratroops Infantry, Engineers, Signal Corps and Military Colleges are called drapeaux (flags). *Regimental colours of the (traditionally) mounted units of the Armoured Cavalry Branch and other cavalry units such as Dragoon Paratroopers, Hussar Paratroopers, Legion Cavalry, Artillery (including Marine Artillery, Legion Artillery, etc.), Transportation, Army Aviation, and Materiel, are called √©tendards (standards). Flag of the 22nd Marine Infantry Regiment Regimental colours are 90 cm √ó 90 cm Tricolore silk square flags ‚Äì standards are smaller: 64 cm √ó 64 cm ‚Äì surrounded by a golden fringe. Both are set on a stave (2.11 m long and 32 mm diameter ‚Äì staves for standards are slightly shorter) ended by a 38 cm pike-shaped finial with a cartouche bearing the initials \\"RF\\" for R√©publique fran√ßaise on one side, and the name or number of the unit on the other side. The cravate hanging from the pike is made of two tricolour silk ribbons, 90 cm long and 24 cm wide, ended by an 8 cm gold fringe on which the unit number or monogram is embroidered in gold, encircled by an oak and laurel wreath. French decorations and fourrag√®res awarded to the unit are pinned or tied to the cravate; foreign awards and decorations are borne on a red velvet cushion. All writings on the colour are embroidered in gold, as well the unit number (or monogram) encircled in antique oak and laurel wreath in each corner of the flag. Obverse of a colour: * R√âPUBLIQUE FRAN√áAISE * (NAME OF THE UNIT) Reverse of a colour: * HONNEUR (Honour) * ET (and) * PATRIE (Fatherland) * (BATTLE HONOURS) =Rifle battalions (chasseurs √† pied)= The Drapeau des chasseurs By tradition, all the Army's rifle battalions (the bataillons de chasseurs √† pied together with the chasseurs alpins) share a single collective colour. Individual battalions have pennants (fanions) and the flag of the Rifles (Drapeau des chasseurs) is given to be held each year in turn to a different rifle battalion. As a result, the single flag displays all the battle honours earned by every rifle battalion. =Other specific colours= 2nd Foreign Infantry Rgt bearing the motto \\"Honneur et Fid√©lit√©\\" * Since 1844, the obverse of Foreign Legion regimental colours do not carry the motto \\"Honneur et Patrie\\" but \\"Honneur et Fid√©lit√©\\" (Honour and Fidelity). This motto was originally written on the flags of the Swiss regiments in French service, such as the R√©giment de Diesbach (85th Infantry of the line). * The √âcole polytechnique, as a military college, also has a colour which does not carry \\"Honneur et Patrie\\" but instead \\"Pour la Patrie, les Sciences et la Gloire\\" (For the Fatherland, Sciences and Glory). The reverse of √âcole polytechnique's colour has one battle honour written under the motto: D√©fense de Paris 1814, awarded in 1901 by President √âmile Loubet. * Since 1880, the motto of the Paris Fire Brigade (which is a military unit belonging to the Engineering Arm), \\"D√©vouement et Discipline\\" (Devotion and Discipline), is written under \\"Honneur et Patrie\\". *The reverse of the Saint-Cyr Military College's colour has seven lines: Honneur / et / patrie / Ils s'instruisent pour vaincre / Premier / bataillon / de France (Honour / and / Fatherland / They study for victory / First / battalion / of France). =The National Navy= Regimental flag of the 1st Naval Fusiliers at the Bastille Day Military Parade The Colours worn by the ships of the National Navy (Marine nationale) consist of the National Ensign and the jack: * the National Ensign is flown at the stern and at the bowsprit if not replaced there by the FNFL jack or a military award jack; * the FNFL jack is flown at the ship's jackstaff if the ship has fought with the Free French Naval Forces, or is named after such a ship; * military award jacks may also be flown at the ship's jackstaff if the ship has received mention in dispatches (in which case crew members wear the corresponding fourrag√®re). Currently, only eight individual National Navy units do have coloursLes drapeaux de la Marine on the French Ministry of Defence and Veterans Affairs website (pdf download) other than the National Ensign or the FNFL jack. Under recommendation 808 EMM/CAB of 5 December 1985, naval units to which colours can be bestowed must be those with manpower equivalent to that of a regiment, which are specialised in combat or services on land (or corps which have inherited their traditions from such units), and naval instruction centres or colleges. The flags are quite similar to those of Land Army units, the difference being the wreaths in corners which encircle anchors instead of name of unit, except for the Naval Gunners (initials CM) and the Fleet Engineering Cadets College (initials EAMF). As of today, these units are (between brackets is where the colours are currently kept): *the 1er R√©giment de fusiliers marins (√âcole des fusiliers marins) ‚Äì the 1st Naval Fusiliers Regiment (Naval Fusiliers College); *the Demi-brigade de fusiliers marins (Compagnie de fusiliers marins de Cherbourg) ‚Äì the Naval Fusiliers Half-Brigade (Cherbourg Naval Fusiliers Company); *the Canonniers marins (Centre d' instruction naval de Saint-Mandrier) ‚Äì the Naval Gunners (Saint- Mandrier Naval Instruction Centre); *the √âcole navale (Groupe des √©coles du Poulmic) ‚Äì the Naval College (Poulmic Schools Group); *the √âcole militaire de la flotte (Groupe des √©coles du Poulmic) ‚Äì the Fleet Military College (Poulmic Schools Group); *the √âcole des mousses (Centre d'instruction naval de Brest) ‚Äì the Cabin Boys College (Brest Naval Instruction Centre); *the √âcole des apprentis m√©caniciens de la flotte (Centre d' instruction naval de Saint- Mandrier) ‚Äì the Fleet Engineering Cadets College (Saint-Mandrier Naval Instruction Centre); *the Bataillon de marins pompiers de Marseille (Bataillon de marins pompiers de Marseille) ‚Äì the Marseille Marine Fire Battalion (The Marseille Marine Fire Battalion). =The Air Force= Sqn 1/30 Normandie- Ni√©men kept at BA112 Reims-Champagne The colours of Air Force (arm√©e de l'Air) units are by all means similar to those of the Army from which it separated as an independent military arm in 1933. Colours are generally not bestowed to Air Army units smaller than escadres (wings), land combat regiments, air force bases, instruction centres or air colleges. =The National Gendarmerie= The units of the National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale) have colours which are very similar to those of the Land Army. Each region (formerly legion), instruction centre, college or Republican Guard Regiment has its flag or standard, altogether 56 flags and 2 standards. The reverse of colours of the Departmental Gendarmerie units and Gendarmerie instruction centres have the same motto as the Land Army units (Honneur et Patrie) but the colours of the Mobile Gendarmerie have their own particular motto: Valeur et Discipline (Valour and Discipline). Most subordinate or smaller units use 50 cm large √ó 40 cm high pennants. The National Gendarmerie also has a common flag, under the guard of the Director-general, on which five battle honours are registered: *Hondschoote 1793 *Villodrigo 1812 *Taguin 1843 *S√©bastopol 1855 *Indochine 1945‚Äì1954 =French influence= Nations of the former French Empire Many of today's armed forces of independent countries that once were part of the French Empire share customs and traditions closely similar if not identical to those of the French military regarding organisation of military arms, army and navy rank structures and uniform styles. Indeed, in countries where the decolonisation process had been conducted through peaceful political negotiations (chiefly French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa), French colonial units were sometimes directly inherited by the former colonies where they had been raised to form the basis of the new national armies. This legacy not only included colour etiquette (the way colours are respected, taken care of and paraded), but also design, adapted to new national flag designs. On the contrary, in countries where independence came as the aftermath of bloody wars of liberation, such as in Vietnam and Algeria, due to the Cold War context, French military culture was strongly rejected often only to be replaced by communist Soviet or Chinese style military culture (colours, ranks, uniforms, parade pace, etc.). Other nations As one of the World's great powers together with Great Britain, France did not only exercise its influence by conquest but also by the prestige of its military. At the height of European colonial expansion in the 19th century, France's army and Britain's navy were each regarded as the most powerful forces ever on land and at sea. This lead many a military to copy both powers' military and naval cultures. As most navies in the World adopted the British naval looks (double-breasted navy blue jacket and peaked cap for officer, blue jean collar for ratings, etc.), numerous land armies adopted French-inspired uniforms during the 1860s and 1870s (both Union and Confederate armies during the American Civil War, the Chilean Army of the War of the Pacific, the Russian Imperial Army, etc.) and even sometimes imported types of French units (e.g. Zouave regiments). France's influence on military fashion dimmed for the time being after the most unexpected French defeat ending the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871 and many armies then changed to adopt Prussian military style (as a perfect example of this trend, Chilean soldiers traded their kepis for pickelhauben). As far as regimental colours are concerned, French influence was mainly to be seen in armies of smaller European powers with strong cultural, economical or political ties to France, notably in such countries whose national flag itself was patterned after the French national flag, such as Belgium or Romania.

Germany German Truppenfahne Units of the Bundeswehr have only a single Colour. The Truppenfahne is a square version of the national flag with the Bundesadler (national shield) overall in the centre. The flag is surrounded by a black, red, and gold lacework border and edged on three sides by gold fringe. The finial is a gilt bronze openwork spearhead surrounding a black and silver Iron Cross. Below the finial, a streamer is attached with the unit badge at the top and its designation embroidered in gold at the end. These streamers are red for army (Heer) units, blue for the navy (Marine), and white for the air force (Luftwaffe). The streamer is the same length as the hoist of the flag. The tradition was also observed by the National People's Army of East Germany, whose unit colours mirrored the national flag. Until the Second World War German military units maintained colours of the Prussian pattern regardless of service branch, while the Waffen-SS followed the national flag pattern. Greece Hellenic Army War Flag Traditionally, Army infantry and tank/cavalry regiments have a single colour/standard or war flag (). This is blue, with a white cross and features St George and the Dragon in the centre.Presidential Decree 348 /17-4-1980, On the war flags of the Armed Forces and the Gendarmerie Corps, Gazette issue A-98/1980, pp. 1486. The flag has no distinguishing features for individual regiments, although battle honours are sometimes added to the flag; the regiment's identity is inscribed on the flagstaff. The pattern has been in use since the 1830s, with no changes between the periods of monarchy or republic. The Hellenic Army Academy has also been awarded a war flag, its cadets having participated in the Battle of Crete in 1941. Similar flags exist also for the Air Force, featuring the archangel Michael. Recently war flags were assigned to the Army NCO Academy and the Police Academy. Unlike the Army, Police and Air Force, the Hellenic Navy uses the Flag of Greece as both the naval ensign and national colour. Holy See Banner of the Swiss Guard with the coat- of arms of commander Daniel Anrig, Pope Francis and Pope Julius II. The flag of the Swiss Guard, the army of the Vatican City, consists of four-quarters. The Coat of Arms of the current pope is in the first quarter, while the arms of Pope Julius II are in the fourth quarter. In the second and third quarters are horizontal stripes of red, yellow and blue, the colours of the unit's uniforms. The flag also has the coat of arms of the commander within a wreath, on a background of the colour of his canton. The design of the flag changes with the election of a new pope and the appointment of a new commander. Hungary Unit colour of the Hungarian Defence Force The 120 cm √ó 140 cm Unit colour of the Hungarian Defence Force is the current regulation colour of all Hungarian Defence Forces units since 15 March 1991. The flag is made of white fibres-satin. The height of the coat of arms with the crown is 57, and the width is 58 cm along with the crown. The coat of arms is made of silk with gold and silver embroidery. The edges of the flagship are surrounded by 11‚Äì11, and 9‚Äì9, 10 cm, red and green flames on the longer sides, extending 15 centimeters. The flames of the flames start and end on each side with a red color, with the flaming tongues separated by a green circle in the four corners of the flag. The flagpole has a 5 mmm national-color silk ribbon on its 3 free edges that do not fit the rod, with 10‚Äì10 centimeters national color silk ribs on two free tips. The white part of the flagpole outside the party is twisted once on the pole, fixed with 3 equally spaced brass nails - 25-25-25 mm equally spaced. The flagpole is a 21-centimeter long, stylized leaf-shaped sandblasted brass, on both sides with a baroque, bronze Coat of arms of Hungary, without shield holders. The rod is 238 centimeters long, cylindrical, scarlet-lacquered, bottom-foldable in the lower third. Brass rings at the pole separation lines and a brass cap at the bottom end.https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=99600003.HM Italy The Colour (bandiera di guerra) for army units (other than cavalry) is a square version of the national tricolour in silk, 99 cm √ó 99 cm. It is mounted on a pike 2.2 m long, made of wood covered with green velvet and decorated with ornate brass nails arranged in a spiral. The pike is topped by a 35 cm high finial consisting of an ornate gilt brass spearhead chased with a five pointed star and the monogram RI (for Repubblica Italiana), which is in turn mounted atop a gilt brass ball on which is the name and date of establishment of the unit. The pike is adorned with two silver cords 67 cm long, each with a 10 cm long silver tassel and a blue silk cravat 8 cm √ó 66 cm with an 8 cm silver fringe at each end, to which the unit's decorations are pinned, the ribbons of the decorations overlapping so that the medals hang down the cravat.  Lithuania  Lithuania's military colours under the Lithuanian Armed Forces tend to follow a mix of the Soviet and British practice, as well as of US tradition, with the national flag being designated as a National Colour, but only flown by guards of honour in ceremonies. Unit colours of the Land Forces follow the Imperial Russian pattern, with the fringe in gold and the unit emblem in the center. Netherlands In the Dutch armed forces, the Colour (or standard in case of the mounted (i.e. cavalry and field and horse artillery) regiments) is orange (except for the colour of the midshipsmans' corps, which is red). On the obverse is the royal cypher of the monarch that gave the regiment its (original) colour, with the unit's name underneath (sometimes including the year of establishment of the unit), both in gold; around the four edges is a laurel branch. On the reverse is the arms of the Kingdom of the Netherlands without the mantle. The shield is blue and is strewn with small upright rectangles; the main device is a crowned rampant lion, holding a sword in its upper paw and a bundle of seven arrows in its lower paw. The lion and rectangles are gold, whilst the blade of the sword is silver. Supporting the shield on either side is a gold rampant lion, facing outwards towards the viewer. There is a gold crown above the shield; whilst below it is a blue scroll with the motto Je Maintiendrai in gold. The shield and lions are surrounded by a wreath of green palm and oak leaves tied together with an orange and blue ribbon, and there is another wavy gold laurel wreath around the four edges. Battle honours are added in the corners of the obverse and sometimes also on the left and right of the Royal cypher; if additional honours are awarded, they are placed on streamers that are attached to the pike until the presentation of a new Colour. The Military Order of William or other decorations are attached to the pike when awarded. The pike has a finial of a lion on a block holding a sword and a bunch of seven arrows. Traditionally a colour is 87 cm √ó 87 cm (with a pike of 2.50 m in length), armoured infantry regiments carry colours that measure 60 cm √ó 60 cm (with a pike of 2.20 m in length). Guards regiments carry the same colour, with some differing details. The same counts for the colours carried by the Royal Military Academy and the Royal Military School. Standards measure 50 cm √ó 50 cm with a pike of 2 m in length. Norway Norwegian infantry units have a stand of colours ‚Äì the first (King's Colour) is the national flag, while the second (Regimental Colour) is unique to each unit: *Infantry: Norwegian line infantry units carry regimental colours, either of a solid colour or divided vertically into two or three stripes, with the Norwegian lion in the centre, the name of the unit, and battle honours embroidered on the field. The colours vary by regiment and derive either from historic associations with predecessor regiments or from the colours of the regiment's oldest known uniform. *Guards: The Royal Norwegian Guards regiment has a regimental colour that is all white, again with the lion in the centre, and with the Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch in each corner. Poland Military colours of the Representative Honor Guard Regiment of the Polish Armed Forces The standard military colours of the Polish Armed Forces are in red and white, with the design tracing back to the Polish Second Republic, a standardized form based on earlier colours. The motto of the Armed Forces, \\"God, Honour, Fatherland\\" () are at the reverse while the Polish military eagle (which differs per service) surrounded by a gold wreath is at the centre of the obverse. The unit's name is inscribed on the obverse. Portugal National colour of Portugal Each of the commands, units, forces and establishments of the Portuguese Armed Forces has a national colour, which is considered the parade version of the Flag of Portugal. The National Republican Guard, the Public Security Police and some fire departments also have national colours. The traditional distinction between colours (, literally \\"flags\\") - carried by foot units - and standards (estandartes) - carried by mounted units - was abolished in the 1960s, with all of them being uniformly reclassified as \\"national standards\\" (estandartes nacionais). At the same time, another type of standard was introduced, this being the heraldic standard, each of which reflects the particular heraldic symbology of the corresponding unit. The official model for the military colours was established in 1911 and states that they should measure 120 cm in the hoist by 130 cm in the fly, the field being vertically divided in green and red, with the National coat of arms in the center, surrounded by two golden olive branches tied by a white scroll containing the motto Esta √© a Ditosa P√°tria Minha Amada (This is my Beloved Blissful Motherland). Despite the existence of this official model, the various branches of the Armed Forces adopted different models of colours over the years, with various designs and dimensions. In March 2020, a uniform model of national colours was adopted for all the branches. This is based in the 1911 official model, but measuring 120 cm both in the hoist and in the fly. The name of the unit, its heraldic symbol and their battle honours are embroidered in a gravat attached to the base of the finial, the colour of the gravate varying accordingly with the branch of service. Naval units were allowed to keep the traditional Order of Christ Cross embroidered in the canton of the cloth of their national colours. The several commands, units, forces and establishments of the Armed Forces will have to replace their old national colours by the new model within 10 years. The national colours of the National Republican Guard and of the Public Security Police follow the 1911 model and continue to keep the traditional practice of having the names of the units inside white scrolls which are inserted on the field of the flag itself. Romania According to the Romanian General Staff, \\"The military colors (drapel de luptƒÉ) are the symbol of military honor, bravery and glory. They evoke the past struggle of the Romanian people for national liberty and the traditions of unity, reminding each soldier of his sacred duty to serve the Fatherland with trust, and to defend at all costs the unity, sovereignty and independence of Romania\\". The military colours are granted to military units by presidential decree, on the advice of the Minister of National Defence, the Minister of Internal Affairs or the director of the Romanian Intelligence Service. According to the Ministry of National Defence, the complete description of this military insignia is as follows: Romanian Military colours. Air Force design The military colours of Romania are made of double silk cloth and have dimensions of 100 √ó 66 cm (2:3 ratio). The canvas has the colours of the Romanian flag and its obverse is identical with the reverse. The national coat of arms, measuring 29 √ó 21.5 cm, is applied in the middle of the yellow stripe, 18 cm above its base. In each corner, 5 cm from the edge of the canvas, is sewed a wreath of oak leaves, which surrounds the weapon signs, all of golden thread: * two crossed swords for land forces * a helicopter blade juxtaposed over a pair of wings in downward flight, a radar and a crossed rocket and telescope for aerial forces * an anchor for naval forces. * the letter J in a rhombus over two crossed swords for gendarmerie units * the emblem of the Romanian Intelligence Service for its units The three sides of the flag not attached to the pole are decorated with fringes of golden thread (5‚Äì7 cm long) and tassels of the same material (10‚Äì12 cm long) hang from the corners of the fly. The flag is attached to the pole by an antioxidant metal rod 70 cm long. The pole, of brown wood, is 240 cm high and 3.5 cm in diameter. A brass cylinder is at the base, 4 cm long and closed on the bottom. The rod is attached to the pole by a brass ring, gilt on its lower part, and a 6 cm high cylindrical protective tube of the same material and gilt on its upper part. The ring (3.2 cm high) is inscribed with the name of the unit. Another brass cylinder is placed on the tip of the pole, 6 cm long and of brass. The eagle, of gilt copper, sheet, 15 cm high and 11.5 cm wide, is placed over this. Looking rightward, the eagle's wings are pointed downward and it holds the thunderbolts of Jupiter in its talons. It is placed on a parallelepipedic support of the same metal (10 √ó 3.5 √ó 2 cm), which has a 3.4 cm high ornament on its lower part. The support is screwed onto the brass cylinder and has inscribed into the front the motto \\"Onoare ≈üi Patrie\\" (\\"Honor and Fatherland\\"). The name of the respective unit is engraved into the reverse. Other features of the military colours are a tie for attaching decorations, six sashes for the troops in the flag's guard and a protective cover of impermeable fabric. The military colours of navy vessels are identical to their ensign. The ensign is in turn identical to the national flag, being made of ordinary canvas in various dimensions, according to the ship's rank, size and place of hoisting.  Russia and Soviet Union  Until Peter the Great assumed the office and throne of Tsar in 1685, various flag designs were used by land and naval units of Imperial Russia. In the 18th century the Imperial Russian Army started to have colours of its own. Starting from the 1730s, Cross style flags in the colours of the various military units appeared in various units: large flags for the infantry and the other arms and small flags for the cavalry and horse artillery. These flags mirrored the Commonwealth military colours of today, with one colour set as the state colour and the rest as the regimental and battalion or squadron colours. 1797 regulations introduced new designs for the infantry‚Äîfor regular units, the state color being white with the state emblem and the company, battalion and/or regimental colors using the assigned colors of their units, for the Imperial Guard a different emblem was used, and the design was identical. New colors were issued in 1800, but only Guards units used them. Regulations set in 1813 unified infantry unit colors into one. Guards units used the orange and black of the Order of Saint George with the facing colors and unit emblem at the center. All these years, the cavalry colors were different. Naval flags, until 1861‚Äì62 (with a brief break in the late 1790s) whilst using the St. Andrew's cross in blue on white, mirrored the British Royal Navy. Russian Armed Forces (top); Russian Army (middle); Russian Aerospace Force (bottom). From 1942 onwards, each regiment in the armed forces of the Soviet Union (especially the Army and Air Force) had its own colour, which was produced to a standard design: *Obverse: red field, a red star yellow bordered and the full name and number of a military unit/school below. Each unit has its own inscription. *Reverse: red field, a gold hammer and sickle and the motto \\"For our Soviet Motherland!\\" (–ó–∞ –Ω–∞—à—É —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫—É—é —Ä–æ–¥–∏–Ω—É!, Za nashu sovyetskuyu rodinu) The colour was gold fringed. The former designs had a red star on the reverse with the name of the Central Executive Committee and later, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR surrounding it, and the obverse had the unit inscription below the coat of arms of the Soviet Union, which had the Soviet Union state motto (\\"Workers of the world, unite!\\") and the red star with the hammer and sickle inside (both were on the flag of the Soviet Union) above it (the latter was near the hoist). Naval flags until 1935 sported different designs. (Distinguished units would be given a second color, the Revolutionary Red Banner of Honor, by the all-Union CEC (before 1924 by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee).) The Soviet Navy colours had the 1935 official design with them (it was later revised in 1950), with additions for units honoured with the Order of the Red Banner, but in 1964 the Supreme Commander's and Defence Minister's own naval colour and the colours of the Navy Commander-in- Chief (formerly the Minister for the Navy) and Chief of Naval Operations were issued with different designs used, with the addition of the Armed Forces General Staff's own naval colour. The first colour was red with the USSR state arms, the next two had the arms with blue stripes indicating office rank, and the final two were adaptations of the naval ensign (with a different ensign with the rank) plus the stripes. The 1935 design (that of a white field with a blue lower stripe and the red star plus the hammer and sickle above the blue stripe) replaced a much earlier, post-revolutionary naval colours design adopted in 1925. In 1944 a different flag was issued to the Navy for its land based units ‚Äì the same design used by the Army with a different obverse having the unit name below the naval ensign. Early flags even had the RKKA and RKKF insignia (the Army General Staff, represented by crossed blue rifles and later became the General Staff's naval colour until 1964, the Naval General Staff and the Army Naval Operations Staff, later the flag of the People's Comissariat for the Navy on its 1938 creation and was issued with two new colours for the Navy Commissar and Deputy Comissar) beside the hammer and sickle, even the flags of the People's Commissar for National Defence and that of the Navy General Staff and the various flags of naval officers which had the ensign on a canton surrounded by a red field, derived from the Navy Commissar's. The cruiser Aurora since 1968 has had a different version of the ensign, flanked by the Order of the Red Banner and of the Order of the October Revolution on the top sides of the star, as the Aurora was the only naval recipient of the latter order in 1967 while in 1918, the Order of the Red Banner was conferred to the ship. =Regimental colours of the Guards units= The colours of those regiments that were classed as \\"Guards\\" was slightly different as per 1942 regulations. These had the portrait of Lenin, the Za nashu motto and the abbreviation \\"USSR\\" (–°–°–°–†, SSSR) on the obverse and the small star with hammer and sickle in its centre, unit's name and a motto on the reverse of the colour. The mottoes were different for every regiment (for example, those regiments made Guards in the Great Patriotic War bore the motto \\"Death to the German invaders\\", –°–º–µ—Ä—Ç—å –ù–µ–º–µ—Ü–∫–∏–º –∑–∞—Ö–≤–∞—Ç—á–∏–∫–∞–º, Smyert' Nyemyetskim zahvatchikam). In some Guards Armies and Corps, different designs on the obverse and reverse were used. Even the Lenin portrait was different in these colours. All of them were gold fringed. The Navy's Guards units still had the 1935 design, with the addition of the Guards ribbon below, except for units which were honoured with the Order of the Red Banner and became Guard units later. The difference is in the red five-pointed star, in which Red Banner Guard unit flags had applied the Guards ribbon below aside from the Order of the Red Banner on the star for units that had the order bestowed on their colours earlier. Units which used the 1944 regimental colour design but adapted for the navy's guards units included air and marine units which still had the obverse of Army and Air Force guards units standards. =Colours of the present-day Russian Armed Forces= Since the birth of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the old Soviet unit colours were retained. Starting in 1998, the traditional Imperial Russian Armed Forces flag designs were reinstated; however, the new designs began to appear in the early years of the 21st century in the Army and Air Force. But the Russian Navy's old naval colour (St. Andrew's cross in blue on a white field) began to be used again in 1992. It has several variations, and the old jack colour of the Soviet Navy (pre-1935) soon became its jack colour, with the red star with the hammer and sickle removed. The unit colours (especially those of the Navy honour guards) have the same design with the unit insignia at the centre of it while Guards units and bemerited and decorated units apply a different version of the colour. The new Army and Air Force unit colours are square shaped, have St. Andrew's cross in the colors of the Ribbon of Saint George, and with the unit insignia in the middle of the observe and the national arms at the reverse, with the service branch emblem on the corners. These colours are the basis for similar ones used today in the various Russian uniformed services. Spain Standard Spanish Army Colour * Standard colours: Units of the Spanish Armed Forces have a single colour based on the national flag. This has the coat of arms in the centre of the flag, surrounded by the regiment's name in black lettering. Red and yellow tassels are attached to the finial which have the battle honours embroidered on them. Formerly a white regimental colour with the unit insignia on the middle of a red Cross of Burgundy or at the sides was used by these units until the adoption of the present colours design in 1843. * Coronelas: Up until the early years of the 20th century, some Spanish regiments had a coronela, or King's Colour in addition to their Regimental Colour based on the national flag. Although officially the only colour is the standard one, some older regiments continue to carry a copy of their old coronela which are used on some occasions to maintain regimental traditions. However, the coronelas no longer have any official standing and are not used on official occasions. The design of such colours are white with the royal arms at the centre and the unit insignia and honours at the sides. * Second order colours ‚Äì regimental/wing guidons and banners: In the Spanish Armed Forces, guidons and banners are second order colours, but are more smaller (guidons are medium square shaped while banners are small square shaped). Guidons are used by battalions, squadrons and groups (even vessels) in the Armed Forces while the banners are used by companies, troops, flights and batteries. All have different and unique designs with some of these having the old Burgundy cross on them. These have also the unit insignia at the centre. Like the Regimental Colour the finials of these colours have the attached unit battle honours and decorations. Sweden Guards colour of the Svea Life Guards (I 1). The design of the colours of the Swedish Armed Forces of today dates back to several separate regulations from early 19th century up to the first united regulations of the three fighting services in 1972. The majority of the army colours are dated back to the summarized regulations of 1950. The colours of the Swedish Amphibious Corps (former Swedish Coastal Artillery) were decided in model 1944. The colours of the Swedish Air Force were modelled in 1938. Most older colours are embroidered by hand while younger ones can be both machine and handmade. When a military unit, as regards traditions, is amalgamated with another, both colours will be carried together. In principle this will go on as long as both colours are usable. When one of the two (or more) no longer can be repaired, the unit will be granted a new colour. This new colour will reflect the traditions of both units without altering the prescribed model. Exceptions from this rule are: * The Life Guards (LG) which maintains its privillege to present both the colour of the former Svea Life Guards (I 1) and the standard of the former Life Guard Dragoons (K 1) * The South Scanian Regiment (P 7) which maintains its privillege to present both the colour of the South Scanian Regiment (P 7) and the standard of the former Scanian Dragoon Brigade (Sk√•nska dragonbrigaden, MekB 8) * The Artillery Regiment (A 9) which maintains its privillege to present both the standard of the Artillery Regiment (A 9) and the honorary standard of the former Wendes Artillery Regiment (A 3) * The Uppland Regiment (S 1) which maintains its privillege to present both the colour of the former Royal Signal Regiment (S 1) and the colour of the former Royal Uppland Regiment (I 8) A colour is normally granted to the following by the King, by the Prime Minister or the Commander of the Armed Forces: * an army unit belonging to the Infantry Branch, the Armoured Troops, the Engineer Troops, the Signal Troops and the Service Troops * the regiments of the Amphibious Corps * the wings of the Swedish Air Force  Turkey  The Flag of Turkey is used by the Turkish Armed Forces as a National Colour, and thus has distinguishing featurers: * the golden TC (Turkish monogram for Republic of Turkey) on the top left corner, surrounded by golden rays * the regimental name, abbreviated, below the crescent and star in white  Ukraine  President Petro Poroshenko presents the colour to the Ukrainian Air Force at the 2017 Independence Day Parade, Kiev Maroon and gold are the colors used in the military colors used in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with origins in the Imperial Russian Army's Cossacks and Ukrainian units. In the observe the Coat of arms of Ukraine, surrounded by a gold wreath, is at the center of an Orthodox Cross ‚Äì both symbols form the emblem of the Armed Forces ‚Äì with a St. Andrew's Cross under it with the same emblem in the sides, with the Armed Forces Motto (For Ukraine, For its glory) surrounding the emblem and crosses. The unit's name is in the reverse. The same design is used in the National Guard of Ukraine but in blue and with the 2015 grenade badge. Active duty NG units sport dark blue colors with the Orthodox Cross, grenade and the coat of arms at the corners. Only the 93rd Mechanized Brigade (Ground Forces), the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces and the Ukrainian Naval Infantry have been granted additional colours so far in addition to the official maroon unit colours. The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine shares a similar colour design to the Armed Forces but with the green colour added to distinguish its units. Yugoslavia and post-Yugoslav nations The first Yugoslav military colours came about when the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was established in 1918. These were the square versions of the Flag of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia with the state coat of arms and the motto of the Yugoslav Royal Army. The unit names were attached to a ribbon at the pole. The colours were inspired by the military colours of Serbia and of the Croat, Slovene and Bosnian military units of resistance against Austria-Hungary during the First World War. With the birth of the communist Partisans in 1941 in time for the Second World War, their flags showed the same Pan-Slavic colours on them (arranged according to nationality) but this time a red star was added in the middle. The naval units had a different ensign used and these flags became the basis for the military colours of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia at the time of its 1943 proclamation. By the time, these flags had the unit name on the pole pennants and were gold fringed. The Partisan General Staff had their own version of it. Postwar colours (from 1947, when the nation became a Federal People's Republic) used various flag design with the Yugoslav People's Army motto in Serbo-Croatian (For the freedom and independence of the socialist fatherland) both in Cyrillic and Latin and differed per unit or service arm of the YPA, but was longer and were gold fringed. Just as before, the unit name stayed on the attached ribbon. Both the Flag of Yugoslavia and the flag of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia were used as National Colours in parades. Unique colours were issued to the Navy, to YPA reserve units and the Territorial Defense Forces of the republics. Today all the nations comprising the former Yugoslavia have separate colour traditions per armed forces, but keep their unique appearance. Guidons and standards =Commonwealth of Nations= The standard is the colours-equivalent for the heavy cavalry (e.g., horse guards and dragoon guards). At 27 in √ó 30 in, on an 8 ft 6 in long pole, it is much smaller than infantry colours, so that it can be carried by a soldier on horseback. The guidon is the equivalent for the light cavalry (e.g., dragoons, light dragoons, hussars and lancers). It is swallow-tailed, 27 in √ó 41 in, with an 8 ft 6 in long pole. The word guidon is a corruption of the French guyde homme ‚Äì 'the guide man'. Originally each troop had its own, but this was quickly reduced to a single, regimental one. With the increased dispersion of troops required in the light cavalry role, their operational function had ceased by the 1830s and they were discontinued. The regiment's kettledrums, with the battle honours woven onto the drum banners (with the exception of 3rd The King's Own Hussars and its successors, where they are uncovered, with the battle honours engraved onto the kettledrums themselves) became the focal point of the regiment's loyalty. In 1952 King George VI reintroduced the guidons of the light cavalry for ceremonial purposes. Both the standard and the guidon are usually of crimson trimmed in gold and with the regiment's insignia in the centre. The regiment's battle honours are emblazoned on both the obverse and reverse, up to a maximum of 22 on each side. =Denmark= Guard Hussar Regiment Cavalry (armour) units carry a standard (), of similar design to the infantry colour, but smaller and square, with the cross centred on the field. The royal cypher is in the upper hoist and the initials of the regiment in the lower hoist. The Guard Hussar Regiment's standard is unique, as it has two monograms ‚Äì with King Frederick VI's monogram in top right corner. =France= In the French Army, mounted units carry √©tendards (standards). Mounted units include Armoured corps and Cavalry, Artillery, Transportation, Army Aviation, and Supplies. The √©tendard is a 64 √ó 64 cm square flag similar to the drapeaux carried by the units of foot, with the same design: the regimental name at the observe and the battle honours at the reserve. =Italy= In the Italian Army, cavalry units carry a stendardo (standard) of the same pattern as the bandiera di guerra, but which measures 60 cm √ó 60 cm. =The Netherlands= The four Hussar regiments of the Royal Netherlands Army carry a standaard (standard), of similar design to the infantry colour, but smaller (50 cm √ó 50 cm). =Portugal= Guidon of a unit of the former Portuguese Fiscal Guard. Until the 1960s, the Portuguese Military followed the traditions of its foot units having colours (, literally \\"flags\\"), while mounted units had standards (estandartes), the latter being smaller versions of the colours. Standards were also carried by naval and aviation units. In the 1960s, the traditional separation between colours and standards was abolished, with all being reclassified as \\"national standards\\" (estandartes nacionais). At the same time, a new type of standard, the heraldic standard, was introduced. Presently, the military units, commands, forces and establishments have both a national standard and an heraldic standard. While the design of the national standards reflects the National Flag, the designs of the heraldic standards reflect the individual heraldic symbology of each of the units. In the Portuguese military parlance, a guidon (gui√£o) is a small square flag of a battalion sized unit. Guidons of a very simple design were introduced in the 19th century, as the tactical field signs of the foot units that didn't carry colours, namely the second battalions of the infantry regiments and the independent ca√ßadores (light infantry) battalions. In the early 20th century, the tactical role of the guidons was discontinued. The guidons assumed then a ceremonial role, coming to have a more elaborate design which incorporated the symbology of their respective units. Guidelines for the design of guidons accordingly with heraldic rules were introduced in the 1950s, these becoming mandatory and standardized in the 1960s. The present guidon design - similar in all branches of the Military - consists in the quadrature of the coat of arms of the corresponding unit or of its parent unit, framed by a bordure. The colors of the bordure can be used to identify a sub-unit inside its parent unit. Besides heraldic standards and guidons, the Portuguese military units also use heraldic pennants (fl√¢mulas). These are small swallow-tailed or triangular flags used to identify company sized units. Some of the Portuguese uniformed security forces and civil emergency organizations also make use of heraldic standards, guidons and pennants, usually modeled after the military ones. =United States= In the United States armed forces, guidons are much more prevalent, with units below battalion size being authorized to use them. In the US Army, these are swallow tailed flags that are 20 in √ó 27 in, and are in the color of the branch of the service the unit is from, with the branch's insignia the most prominent device. Also on the guidon is included the unit's identifying letter, and the number(s) of its parent unit. War service and campaign streamers are not attached to these guidons, but unit citation streamers can be. Guns War Trophy Committee in 1921. In regiments of the (British) Royal Artillery, and artillery regiments of other Commonwealth countries, the guns are afforded the status of colours. This is due to the difficulty of artillery regiments being able to carry flags onto the battlefield, and the fact that the guns themselves were the rallying points for the soldiers manning them. As a consequence, whenever artillery regiments parade, the etiquette that would normally be applied to the colours is applied to the guns. During the Battle of Balaclava gunners abandoned their guns, in effect abandoning their colours, causing disgrace. Because the guns have the status of colours, gunners of commonwealth countries will attempt to prevent their guns falling intact into enemy hands both for practical reasons (so that the guns can not be turned and used against their own side) and for the honour of the regiment. For example, the last action of gunners of the Royal Artillery during the fall of Singapore was to destroy their guns. The Honourable Artillery Company, the oldest regiment in the British Army, and not part of the Royal Artillery, is the only artillery regiment to have both colours and guns, which are treated with equal respect. In Singapore, however, since its independence the Singapore Army's artillery arm (the Singapore Artillery) uses colours instead of guns; this is also the case for the Malaysian Army, Pakistan Army, Royal Cambodian Army and the Royal Thai Army, whose artillery units use colours and not guns on parade. This has been the same case for the Indian Regiment of Artillery, which presents colours in dismounted parades, and the Sri Lanka Artillery, which has a strand of colours similar to the HAC. Etiquette *The Regimental Colour (or Standard or Guidon) is always paraded whenever the regiment is on a formal parade. However, the Sovereign's (King's or Queen's)/Presidential Colour is only paraded on certain occasions. *Compliments (for example saluting and presenting arms) are always paid to the (uncased) Colours. *When the Colours are being paraded, they are carried either by a subaltern or warrant officer, dependent on the regiment. On parade, the Colours always have an armed escort, the Colour Party, who would normally be non-commissioned officers. In the infantry this role usually falls to Colour Sergeants. *When the Colours are not being paraded, most regiments house them in their Officers' Mess. They are cased and secured every night. *When a regiment is presented with new Colours, the old Colours, which will now never again be paraded, are laid up (i.e.: put on permanent display) in a place sacred to the Regiment (for example the Regimental Chapel). Ceremonies of colours =Royal Navy= The British Royal Navy and other navies of the Commonwealth of Nations call the flag- raising ceremony that happens every morning when a ship is in harbour colours. In British home waters, colours is conducted at 0800 (eight bells in the morning watch) from 15 February to 31 October inclusive, and at 0900 (two bells in the forenoon watch) during the winter. When sunset is at or before 2100, flags are lowered at sunset at the ceremony of sunset. When sunset is after 2100, the evening flag lowering ceremony is called evening colours and carried out at 2100. =United States Navy= The United States Navy performs the same ceremonies, called \\"Morning Colors\\" and \\"Evening Colors\\", at 0800 and sunset each day. When Colors is played aboard Navy and Marine Corps bases, those outdoors must stop to render proper courtesies by saluting if in uniform or, if out of uniform, by standing at attention, until \\"Carry On\\" is sounded. Marines and sailors driving on base during this time are expected to stop their vehicles and stand at attention until the ceremony is over. =Yacht clubs= Many traditional yacht clubs worldwide also conduct morning and evening colour ceremonies. At 0800 each morning and at sunset during the club's active sailing season the ceremony is performed by the launchmen or harbourmaster. * First, a bell is sounded as an alert for all members and guests present to stand at attention. * A cannon is then fired and the national ensign hoisted (or lowered if sunset). * At the conclusion of the ceremony the most senior officer present says: \\"As you were\\" and members and guests may carry on.

Teasdale was born in Sheffield to a family of cutlers. He performed several times as the clown in pantomimes and harlequinades before cultivating a reputation for playing the ‚Äòman-monkey‚Äô. Teasdale toured the United Kingdom with this act with much success. His most famous stunt was his attempt to sail down the River Don, Sheffield, in a barrel pulled by ducks. As well as performing, Teasdale managed several theatres. In 1862, Teasdale's wife, Sarah, separated from him, taking their two daughters with her. Teasdale discovered Sarah's whereabouts and attacked her with an empty pistol before a neighbour intervened. He was convicted of attempted murder and served two years in Wakefield Prison (1862-1864). Teasdale came out of prison a ‚Äòconverted clown‚Äô, having become a devout Christian. He gave up the theatre and joined the Hallelujah Band in Sheffield. In 1878 he published his autobiography, The Life and Adventures of Harvey Teasdale, the Converted Clown and Man Monkey, with his remarkable conversion in Wakefield Prison, and by 1881 he purported to have sold over 40,000 copies. During his later life Teasdale preached Methodism in and around Sheffield. He was reunited with Sarah and lived with her until she died in 1883. He remarried in 1886. Teasdale died in 1904 in Firvale Workhouse Asylum and is buried in the General Cemetery, Sheffield.Teasdale, Harvey, The Life and Adventures of Harvey Teasdale, the Converted Clown and Man Monkey, with his remarkable conversion in Wakefield Prison, 1881 Early life Teasdale was born in Sheffield Park, and during his childhood he moved around Sheffield with his family. He attended several different schools, but he ‚Äòseldom went‚Äô unless accompanied by his sister, preferring to play truant. He began his education at the Carver Street National School, but instead of attending classes preferred to make trips to the Wicker Bridge and swim in the water fully dressed to amuse the blacksmiths. He then moved to Netherthorpe Academy where, when he attended school, he showed early signs of having a theatrical personality: ‚ÄòI used to amuse the scholars by leaping through hoops and over chairs like a monkey‚Äô. He was later sent to Fox's School where his mischievous reign continued. He alludes to being very popular in the school after playing numerous pranks on his school master, such as knocking a needle through his chair. Once more he was taken out of school, this time being relocated to a boarding school in the nearby town of Dronfield. Teasdale was a sprightly child who was ‚Äòvery fond of running up spouts and getting on to roofs of buildings and running on the slates like a cat‚Äô. As a result, he was often involved in accidents and scrapes. Furthermore, he got into frequent fights with other boys in the town: ‚ÄòI do not think at that time there was a lad in Sheffield‚Ä¶ could stand any chance with me at fighting‚Äô. After another failed attempt at settling his son in to a school, Teasdale's father, Benjamin, decided to keep him at home to with the intention of training him for the cutlery trade. However, on several occasions he claims to have shirked his errands. His family moved from Sheffield to Walkley Hall and it was here that Teasdale declared ‚Äòit was prophesied by one of the Walkley Belles that Harvey would become an actor!‚Äô He began attending plays at Sheffield's Theatre Royal and his interest in acting was ignited. However, he still made time for mischief, like stealing fish at Crookes Moor Dam: ‚ÄòThe fish that I had caught were in my hat on my head. When asked what I had done with the fish I said that I had caught none. The fish‚Ä¶ at that moment jumped on my head and appeared to my guilty conscience to say ‚ÄúHarvey, what a liar you are‚Äù‚Äô.‚Äô In 1832 the Cholera epidemic swept Sheffield and Teasdale was one of its victims. He claimed he was very ill, but nevertheless managed to survive. Soon after his recovery Teasdale and a friend named Charles Black decided they wanted to leave Sheffield and head to London, but with no transport they had barely reached Chesterfield before they chose to give up.Harvey Teasdale, The Life and Adventures of Harvey Teasdale, the Converted Clown and Man Monkey, with his remarkable conversion in Wakefield Prison, 1881 Performing Life Harvey began performing in Sheffield public houses and theatres in the early 1830s. He moved around the city taking rooms at different pubs, often playing the clown in performances. He alludes continuously to the vice and danger associated with the life of an actor: ‚ÄòI shall not record the wicked scenes that were enacted in this room. I shall not lift the curtain‚Äô. Teasdale's most famous stunt was his attempt to sail down the River Don in a barrel drawn by ducks. He advertised his performance on flaming placards throughout Sheffield and on the day approximately 70,000 people lined the streets to watch. As he sailed along the force of the crowd became so great part of the wall collapsed sending many spectators in to the water. Teasdale maintained that the cries of the people who had fallen ‚Äòmight have appalled a stouter heart than mine‚Äô. Nobody was hurt, but many people ‚Äòcursed old Harvey and his ducks‚Äô. His attempt was a failure. The Sheffield Iris described the stunt as foolish novelty: ‚ÄòThe clown (Teasdale) made a start with his tub and ducks‚Ä¶ but they were completely unmanageable, and he rolled and rocked about with his short paddles until he got a good dousing‚Äô. Teasdale first played the 'man-monkey', his signature act, at Grantham Theatre in the mid 1840s. He drew in the crowds by jumping from balcony to stage dressed as a monkey. Teasdale was following in a tradition of Skin Performance: actors who impersonated and dressed like animals. His monkey performance was a huge success and it was from here that he began touring the country, meeting with excited audiences. Many local newspapers praised his performance, one referring to him as ‚Äòthe Yorkshire Phenomenon!‚Äô However, despite his many successes round the country, Teasdale never managed to make a name for himself in London, performing in the capital once to negative reviews: ‚ÄòMr Harvey Teasdale was very slow. He has much to learn before he can take his stand as clown in a leading London theatre‚Äô. He allegedly fought with the manager of Astley's Amphitheatre, London, and left, never to return to perform in the capital again. Yet in his memoir Teasdale speaks highly of his own talent and success: ‚ÄòIt was acknowledged, by undisputed authority, that mine was the best representation of the monkey that had ever appeared on stage‚Äô. Attempted murder and trial In 1862 Teasdale's wife, Sarah, separated from him, taking their two daughters with her. Teasdale struggled to track them down and when he did begged them to return to him. After much chasing, Teasdale finally confronted Sarah, accusing her of earning a living as a prostitute and encouraging their daughters to do the same. He broke into her lodgings and fired a blank at her before attempting to cut her throat and his own. A neighbour intervened and alerted the authorities. Sarah survived the attack and was taken to hospital and Teasdale was arrested and taken to court. Most newspapers documenting the trial mention Teasdale's over- dramatic performance on the stand, reporting that there was laughter in the court room when Teasdale said ‚ÄòI determined to fire it off and cut my throat in the smoke‚Äô. In his own defense he made the following claims: ‚ÄòFour months ago we were staying at Leeds. I have been married to her 26 years. I loved the ground she walked on and she hated me. While we were in Leeds she left home one Saturday morning. I went in search of her and for the first time I found she was getting her living on the streets, and she boasted that I had not found her out‚Äô. He was sentenced to two years hard labour in Wakefield Prison. Conversion and controversy Teasdale was interned at Wakefield between 1862 and 1864. He claimed that whilst in prison he underwent a conversion and decided to leave behind his life of vice in the performing industry and preach the doctrines of Methodism. Once released from prison Teasdale moved back to Sheffield and joined the Hallelujah Band to spread the message of Methodism. However, his sincerity is questionable: in an attempt to rid himself of his former persona and the monkey that had become his alter-ego, Teasdale advertised that he would burn his effects, including his monkey costume, in Sheffield's Temperance Hall. The Sheffield Daily Telegraph reported that ‚Äòplacards have been circulated within the town, stating that Harvey Teasdale, the well-known man monkey and clown, would relate his experiences and destroy his dresses and theatrical effects‚Äô. Yet a different newspaper documents him burning his effects in Leeds and the Era suggests they were for sale: ‚ÄòThe whole of Harvey Teasdale‚Äôs pantomimes, monkey pieces, manuscripts‚Ä¶ to be sold for ¬£2 10s‚Äô. In spite of his self-proclaimed conversion, there is evidence to suggest that Teasdale's former life-style did not allude him. Teasdale claims he then went to Totley and bought a donkey named Charley, with whom he would travel around the moors searching for work and food. He suggests it was his faith which got him through this lean period. Yet, it is questionable whether he was sincerely struggling or painting himself as a martyr. He was later reunited with Sarah, whom he converted to Methodism. Death Teasdale died in 1904, aged 86. His obituary doesn't give a definite cause of death instead stating that ‚Äòfor some time his brain had been affected‚Äô. He died in Firvale Workhouse Asylum, where he had been living for a fortnight. He is buried in the General Cemetery, Sheffield. Autobiography and legacy Teasdale published the first edition of his autobiography in 1878. It went through several editions and by 1881 it had sold over 40,000 copies. Teasdale continued to sell his autobiography, alongside signed photographs of himself. The Life and Adventures of Harvey Teasdale, the Converted Clown and Man Monkey, with his remarkable conversion in Wakefield Prison is an unusual example of Victorian life-writing, detailing the extraordinary life of a working class performer who described himself as ‚ÄòHarvey Teasdale, the converted clown, and once the greatest impersonator of the man monkey in the world, now a sinner saved by grace, fighting the battle of the cross!‚Äô The autobiography has been noted for its highly dramatic tone, heavy use of Shakespearean and biblical quotations and the author's questionable sincerity. Over the past few years a renewed local interest in Teasdale has developed. Efforts are being made towards the reprinting of his memoir within the University of Sheffield. In September 2014, Point Blank Theatre Company premiered their production, Harvey Teasdale: the Sheffield Man Monkey, based on Teasdale's life as part of Sheffield's Festival of the Mind. The production featured Vern Griffiths as Harvey Teadale, Jack Windle as the Chorus and Dr Butler's Hatstand Medicine Band as the Hallelujah Band.

He also provided the voice of his half-brother, President Bill Clinton, in an episode of The Blues Brothers Animated Series. Music career Clinton developed his singing career under the direction of Arkansas music impresario and manager Butch Stone. He gained professional experience by singing warm-ups for the studio audiences at tapings of the sitcom Designing Women, as well as by working as a lounge singer. As a result of a deal struck by Stone and music-industry attorney Stann Findelle, Clinton was initially contracted to Atlantic Records in 1992. His first album, Nothing Good Comes Easy, was released in September 1993 on the Pyramid/Atlantic/Rhino label. In December 1999, Clinton and his band paid a visit to Pyongyang, performing alongside North and South Korean musical acts. Conviction and pardon During his brother's presidential campaign and subsequent administration, Clinton was given the codename \\"Headache\\" by the Secret Service due to his controversial behavior.Watson, Robert. \\"Life in the White House: A Social History of the First Family and The President's House\\". State University of New York Press, 2004, p. 125. In January 2001, before his brother left office, Clinton was granted a controversial presidential pardon for a 1985 cocaine possession and drug-trafficking conviction. Roger Clinton Jr. had served time in federal prison after being convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in a sting operation. The pardon allowed for the conviction to be expunged from his criminal record. Driving-under-the-influence arrests Roger Clinton pleaded guilty in August 2001 to a misdemeanor count of reckless driving after Hermosa Beach, California, city prosecutors agreed to drop two driving-under-the-influence (DUI) charges and one count of disturbing the peace against him. He was sentenced then to two years' probation, ordered not to drive with any alcohol or drugs in his system and to pay about $1,350 in fines and costs. On June 5, 2016, Roger Clinton was arrested for DUI in the seaside city of Redondo Beach, about south of downtown Los Angeles, California. Since it had been more than ten years since his first DUI, according to California state law, this arrest was also treated as a first-time DUI. Clinton pleaded no contest to the charge of driving while impaired. The charge of driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.08% or higher was dismissed. As part of his plea agreement, he was sentenced to three years' probation for the DUI, and two days in jail for refusing a chemical test. He was ordered to pay a $390 fine (which increases to nearly $2,000 when penalty assessments, court fees, and other fines are added) and was also ordered to attend a nine-month alcohol program‚Äîthe most a first-time offender can get‚Äîbecause his blood alcohol content measured 0.230% and 0.237% in a preliminary alcohol screening. In addition, because his arrest occurred in Los Angeles County, under the terms of Assembly Bill 91, the Department of Motor Vehicles also required that he install an ignition interlock device in all vehicles he owned for a minimum of 5 months.

According to the , it has a population of people. Gapan is nicknamed the \\"Footwear Capital of the North\\" due to the thriving footwear making industry in the city. History Old records called the town Ibon. Gapan was founded by the Spanish curates and officials who, in their early occupation, exercised great influence over the people and the things they were doing. History places Gapan as one of the first towns of Pampanga founded sometime in the middle part of the sixteenth century. Records of the first Catholic mission to the far east indicated that in 1595, Fathers Contres Tendilla, Caballo and Salazar were responsible for clearing the forest which later became a pueblo. In this pueblo, a church, presedencia and residential houses made of bricks and lime were constructed, now the age-old landmarks of the city. Its foundation in 1595 makes Gapan the oldest town in Nueva Ecija and one of the oldest in the Philippines. It was likewise a big pueblo embracing an area as far as Cabanatuan City in the north, which was its barrio with the name Cabanatuan before it separated in 1750: the Sierra Madres in the East, San Miguel, Bulacan in the south and Candaba, Pampanga in the West. Gradually as the Spanish power waned and economic progress caught up in the area, the pueblo disintegrated into many pueblos until it remained to comprise only the towns of Pe√±aranda, General Tinio and San Leonardo (formerly called Manikling) all of Nueva Ecija province. In fact the Patron Saint Divina Pastora had its origin or residence in Barrio Callos, Pe√±aranda. =Contemporary= By virtue of Republic Act No. 9022 and its ratification in a plebiscite subsequently held on August 25, 2001, Gapan was converted into a component city of Nueva Ecija. Ernesto L. Natividad became the first city mayor of Gapan. Geography Gapan is located in the southern part of the province. It is bounded to the north by Pe√±aranda and San Leonardo, to the east by the Gen. Tinio, to the south by San Miguel in neighboring Bulacan province, and to the west by San Isidro. =Climate= =Barangays= Gapan is politically subdivided into 23 barangays. Demographics Economy Current major sources of income include farming, slipper making, fishponds, poultry and piggery, and commercial establishments. The city of Gapan held tremendous promise not only in its natural resources but also in its potentials in agri base industries and in footwear industries which help sustain its virtual role in agricultural and industrial production. Commercial and trade activities in the city are further accelerated by the influx of financing lending institution and new businesses.

It tells the story of two Russian boys whose father suddenly returns home after a 12-year absence. He takes the boys on a holiday to a remote island on a lake that turns into a test of manhood of almost mythic proportions. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival (as well as the award for the best first film). It received generally positive reviews from critics. In a 2016 BBC critics' poll, The Return was ranked the 80th-greatest film of the 21st century. Plot In contemporary Russia, Ivan and his older brother Andrei have grown a deep attachment to each other to make up for their fatherless childhood. Both their mother and grandmother live with them. After running home after a fight with each other, the boys are shocked to discover their father has returned after a 12-year absence. With their mother's uneasy blessing, Ivan and Andrei set out on what they believe will be a simple fishing vacation with him. Andrei is delighted to be reunited with their father and Ivan is apprehensive towards the man whom they know only from a faded photograph. At first, both brothers are pleased with the prospect of an exciting adventure, but they soon strain under the weight of their father's awkward and increasingly brutal efforts to make up for the missing decade. Ivan and Andrei find themselves alternately tested, rescued, scolded, mentored, scrutinized, and ignored by the man. Andrei seems to look up to his father while Ivan remains stubbornly defensive. As the truck stops and caf√©s give way to rain-swept, primeval wilderness coastline, Ivan's doubts give way to open defiance. Andrei's powerful need to bond with a father he's never known begins, in turn, to distance him from Ivan. Ivan and his father's test of will escalates into bitter hostility and sudden violence after the trio arrives at their mysterious island destination. Ivan has an outburst of anger after witnessing his father strike Andrei. He shouts at his father, runs into the forest, and climbs to the top of the observatory tower. Andrei and their father run after him. The father tries to reason with Ivan, but this only stresses Ivan further. He then threatens to jump down from the top of the tower. The father tries to reach out to him, but falls to his death. Ivan and Andrei take the body across the forest, bring him on board the boat, and sail back to where they came. While the boys are putting their gear in the car, the boat starts to drift away. Andrei screams, \\"Father!\\" and starts running towards the shore, followed by Ivan, but it is too late. The boat and the body are sinking. Ivan screams \\"Father!\\" for the first and the last time from the bottom of his heart. They get into the car and drive away. The film ends with still images from their journey.

It is approximately long, running from its source near the village of Gie√üelrade in Ostholstein to Travem√ºnde, where it flows into the Baltic Sea. It passes through Bad Segeberg, Bad Oldesloe, and L√ºbeck, where it is linked to the Elbe‚ÄìL√ºbeck Canal. It is navigable for sea-going vessels from the Baltic to the L√ºbeck ports. The Herren Tunnel crosses the Trave, as do numerous bridges, and a ferry connects Travem√ºnde with Priwall. Tributaries of the Trave include the Wakenitz and the Stepenitz. Course =Source and upper Trave= The Trave rises in Gie√üelrade (a village in Ostholstein), whence it flows first southwesterly through the Wardersee to Bad Segeberg and then further south to Bad Oldesloe. There it bends eastward to just south of Reinfeld, flowing past Hamberge and (a district of L√ºbeck) to reach L√ºbeck. =In L√ºbeck= The Trave in L√ºbeck, by Walter Moras The Elbe‚ÄìL√ºbeck Canal joins the Trave from the south shortly before the river reaches L√ºbeck. In medieval L√ºbeck the river was transformed according to the needs of shipping and the town's defense, making the Old Town into an island. South of the L√ºbeck Cathedral the channel forks in several directions, with the original channel known as the Town Trave. The L√ºbeck town moat branches off to the west, and the Canal Trave separates eastward from the Town Trave's course and runs in the former bed of the Wakenitz to the northeast side of the Old Town. The modern Wakenitz joins the Canal Trave from the east, and the three channels recombine at the north end of the Old Town island. =Lower Trave= North of L√ºbeck the seaports begin. Between the Old Town and is L√ºbeck's commercial port. The Schwartau enters the river from the north here. On the peninsula between the Schwartau and the Trave is the Slavic castle of Liubice. The river passes the nature preserve and flows around . Here the city of Travem√ºnde sits on the western shore. The Trave widens into the Travef√∂rde estuary between Herreninsel and the mouth in the Bay of L√ºbeck, including the P√∂tenitzer Wiek and the Dassower See (fed by the Stepenitz). The river then flows out between Travem√ºnde and the Priwall Peninsula into the Baltic Sea. Geopolitical significance In the early Middle Ages, the upper reaches of the Trave (together with the Schwentine) formed part of the Limes Saxoniae and the western boundary of Wagria. In the Old Town of L√ºbeck the river forms part of the medieval town fortifications. The lower reaches today form the border between Schleswig- Holstein and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Geology The course of the lower Trave arose in the last ice age (the Weichselian glaciation), when glacier flows carved deep fjords into what is now the Baltic Sea coast. Since the end of the ice age the groove communicates with the sea; its lower end is called the Travef√∂rde (Trave Fjord). Recreation and conservation The area surrounding the course of the Trave is designated as a preserved \\"flora and fauna habitat\\" by the European Union Habitats Directive. The river runs through or beside a series of nature preserves and undeveloped lands, and its basin is home to a variety of rare and endangered animal species. The area is a popular destination for hiking, cycling, canoeing and fishing. The German Friends of Nature organization declared the Trave its German Riverscape of the Year for 2016/17.

She drank, smoked cigarettes on the sly, and immersed herself in reading and music in search of escape.

Her musical choices included classical canon, traditional church compositions, and folk music offset by David Bowie and other glam rockers. During that time a visit to relatives in Glasgow, Scotland‚Äîin particular a behind-the-scenes tour of a power station, with its efficient water recycling system‚Äîleft Griffith feeling \\"terribly alert.\\" She paid more attention thereafter to the occasional school course that interested her‚Äîchemistry, physics, and biology especially‚Äîand at age fourteen broadened her artistic tastes to encompass the works of William S. Burroughs, Led Zeppelin, and early Pink Floyd. When Griffith was fifteen, she recognised her love for a female friend, Una Fitzgerald. Once the two girls were of age, they started a romance. After almost two years, they realised their differences, and Fitzgerald left Griffith. At this point Griffith began an extended tour of Leeds' after-hours underbelly, even as her sister Helena developed a drug habit. During this phase Griffith met Carol Taylor,Reply to Holly , \\"Ask Nicola\\". \\"Carol Taylor on percussion\\" and the two became longtime partners. Griffith moved out of her parents' household in Leeds and relocated to Hull, where she and Taylor initially lived a marginal existence. Recreational drugs became Griffith's default setting. Nonetheless she states that in Hull, \\"My real education began.\\" Griffith got to know \\"feminists and intellectuals ‚Ä¶ bikers and drug dealers, and dykes pimping out their girlfriends.\\" She found her first women's community there, and she read \\"earnest feminist fiction\\" as part of her regular use of Hull's central library. After the 1981 founding of the band Janes Plane, Griffith began to write her own words as its lead singer and lyricist. The group, a five-woman ensemble, played its first gig at an International Women's Day celebration in 1982. Janes Plane achieved some local notoriety and performed in several North England cities and on national TV.\\"Ammonite and Janes Plane\\". Retrieved 1 April 2014. Griffith attempted her first fiction after the group disbanded. In 1983 Griffith wrote a diary entry detailing her dreams of becoming a \\"best- seller.\\" She was writing her first (unpublished) novel, Greenstorm. Griffith began studying the physical art of self-defense the next year, and in August 1984 she smoked her last cigarette. The following month she gave up hashish and amphetamines. She received rejections of her manuscript from two publishers. Elements later to appear in Ammonite arose in a second unpublished (this one also unsubmitted) novel, \\"We Are Paradise\\" (ca. 1985). Griffith suffered some personal setbacks that had roots in 1985. By that time Helena had gone from addiction to also dealing heroin and amphetamines. As the year ended, Griffith (already sick with influenza) was hurt and briefly hospitalised after helping another women in a bar assault. Delayed reaction to the attack contributed to what she later characterised as PTSD in June 1986.\\"Tetris + Ecstasy = no PTSD\\", \\"Ask Nicola\\" Her writing and a women's self-defense course that she was teaching sustained her amid these difficulties, and Helena's counterexample helped persuade Griffith that the time to abandon all recreational drug use‚Äîincluding magic mushrooms, which she had relied on extensively‚Äîhad come. By late 1987 Griffith had made her first professional fiction sale, of a short story, \\"Mirrors and Burnstone,\\" to Interzone. She was also experiencing symptoms of multiple sclerosis, though her illness remained unrecognised. Before her starting a job at the Unemployed Advice Centre, Griffith travelled with Taylor to Whitby. But traditional life made Griffith restless. To escape, she applied for two different international courses: one at a women‚Äôs martial arts camp in the Netherlands, one at the Clarion Workshop at Michigan State University. Clarion accepted her with a scholarship. Griffith crossed the Atlantic to attend Clarion in 1988. There, while she was studying with such authors as Kim Stanley Robinson, Kate Wilhelm, Tim Powers, and Samuel R. Delany,1992 interview by Dave Slusher Griffith met and fell in love with writer Kelley Eskridge. A quarter-million- word correspondence between the two women ensued.  Personal life  Griffith was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in March 1993. She lives with her wife, author Kelley Eskridge, in Seattle.  Career  Nicola Griffith published her first novel Ammonite in 1993. It won both the James Tiptree, Jr. Award and the Lambda Award, and was short-listed for the Arthur C. Clarke Award, BSFA Award, and Locus Award. Her second novel, Slow River (1994), won the Nebula Award, for best novel1997 Nebula Awards and another Lambda. Together with Stephen Pagel, Griffith has edited a series of three anthologies, Bending the Landscape: Fantasy (1997), Bending the Landscape: Science Fiction (1998) and Bending the Landscape: Horror (2001). The Blue Place (1998), Stay (2002), and Always (2007) are linked novels about the character Aud Torvingen. Griffith's collection of stories, With Her Body (2004), comprises three short works.

The Tupinamb√° are one of the various Tupi ethnic groups that inhabit present- day Brazil since before the conquest of the region by Portuguese colonial settlers. In the first years of contact with the Portuguese, the Tupinamb√°s lived in the whole Eastern coast of Brazil, and the name was also applied to other Tupi-speaking groups such as the Tupiniquim, Potiguara, Tupinamb√°, Temimin√≥, Caet√©, Tabajara, Tamoio, Tupina√© among others. In an exclusive sense, it can be applied to the Tupinamb√° peoples who once inhabited the right shore of the S√£o Francisco river in the Rec√¥ncavo Baiano and from the Cabo de S√£o Tom√© in Rio de Janeiro to the town of S√£o Sebasti√£o in S√£o Paulo. Their language survives today in the form of Nheengatu. There are two remaining regions inhabited by the Tupinamb√°. The Tupinamb√° of Oliven√ßa live in the Atlantic Forest region of southern Bahia. Its area is 10 kilometers north of the city of Ilh√©us and extends from the sea coast of the village of Oliven√ßa to the Serra das Trempes and Serra do Padeiro.

Biography  √Ålvarez Thomas was born in Arequipa, Peru, and his family lived for some time in Lima. When his father, who was in Spanish service, was called back to Madrid in 1797, they travelled via Buenos Aires. The family stayed there while his father continued the voyage alone, and √Ålvarez joined the army in 1799. Subsequently, he got heavily involved in the independence war in Argentina. In the war against the British in 1806/07, he was wounded and captured, and released only after the withdrawal of the British troops. Under Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, he fought as a colonel at Montevideo, where he was awarded a medal. However, soon after he openly opposed the politics of de Alvear's government, and his insurrection caused the resignation of the latter and resulted in a new election of a Supreme Director in the Constituting General Assembly, where he was designated interim Supreme Director from April 20, 1815, to April 16, 1816, in place of the elected Jos√© Rondeau, who was absent on a military campaign in Peru. √Ålvarez was sworn in on May 6 but had to resign a year later after some military failures. When the Constituting General Assembly was dissolved in 1820, he was, as a still-influential member of the former leadership, sent to prison, but released after 19 days. Subsequently, his political influence was greatly diminished. In 1825, he was named ambassador in Peru, and in October also named ambassador to Chile. After his return to Buenos Aires, he was exiled and also spent some time in prison for his opposition against the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. He emigrated to Rio de Janeiro, from where he tried to mount an insurrection against Rosas in 1840. In 1846, he fled first the Chile and then Peru, before returning to Buenos Aires after the fall of Rosas government in 1852. He died likely of tuberculosis on July 20, 1857, in Buenos Aires in Argentina at the age of 70.

The original text appears to have been written earlier than the manuscript itself; the text refers to both a volcanic eruption and an earthquake in 1211 as contemporary events, and Orkney is stated to be under Norwegian rule.

Besides that text, there is the Ynglinga saga in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla. The text also contains ethnographic details, including a description of a shamanic s√©ance among the Sami people. It is the earliest preserved written source for many of its historical details.  Dates  Along with √Ågrip af N√≥regskonungas√∂gum and the work of Theodoricus monachus, Historia Norwegi√¶ is considered one of the Norwegian synoptic histories, and is thought to have been written, at the earliest, sometime between 1160 and 1175AD. This dating, however, is under debate and 1220AD may be more accurate. The text may have been composed somewhere in eastern Norway. The manuscript was published by Peter Andreas Munch in 1850 as Symbol√¶ ad Historiam Antiquiorem Rerum Norwegicarum.

The D.B.A. is a terminal degree in business administration. Along with the Ph.D. or D.Phil., it represents the highest academic qualification in business administration, and is typically required to gain employment as a full-time, tenure-track university professor or postdoctoral researcher in the field. As with other earned doctorates, individuals with the degree are awarded the academic title doctor, which is often represented via the English honorific \\"Dr.\\" or the post-nominal letters \\"DBA\\" or \\"PhD.\\" D.B.A. candidates submit a significant project, typically referred to as a thesis or dissertation, consisting of a body of original academic research that is in principle worthy of publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Candidates must defend this work before a panel of expert examiners called a thesis, dissertation, or doctoral committee.FAQs AACSB In the United States, the Doctor of Business Administration is recognized by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as a research degree. The D.B.A. is also considered by both the United States Department of Education and the National Science Foundation to be equivalent to the more commonly awarded Ph.D. Structure and format Doctor of Business Administration programs have a dual purpose: contribute to business theory and further develop the professional practice (e.g. contribute to professional knowledge in business). Universities generally require candidates to have significant experience in business, particularly in roles with leadership or other strategic responsibilities. D.B.A. candidates specialize in areas such as management science, information technology management, organizational behavior, economics, finance and the like. As with other doctorate programs, curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. According to the European higher education standards set by the Bologna Process, the normal duration of research doctorate programs like the D.B.A. and Ph.D. is usually 3-4 years of full-time study. The responsibility for the structure of doctoral programs resides within the graduate research committees or their equivalent within the university. As such, D.B.A programs have a specific set of university regulations and are subject to quality approval processes. Regulations include references to protocols for treating ethical issues in research. These regulations are widely used in Australian Universities. For instance, a D.B.A student cannot embark on the research phase before passing all his or her coursework. Furthermore, upon passing the proposal stage, he or she must clear ethics-related issues with an Ethics Committee. The D.B.A candidate must go through numerous internal moderations of the dissertation before submitting to external examinations (usually at least two). Successful candidates usually revise their dissertations numerous times before final approval is granted from the doctoral committee. Relationship between D.B.A. and Ph.D. The Doctor of Business Administration and the Ph.D. in Business Administration are equivalent degrees in the United States. Also, both doctorates are viewed as research doctorates representing the highest academic qualification in business in the United States. As such, both D.B.A. and Ph.D. programs require students to develop original research leading to a dissertation defense. Furthermore, both doctorates enable holders to become faculty members at academic institutions. The D.B.A. and Ph.D. in Business Administration are terminal degrees, allowing the recipient to obtain a tenure-track position in the United States; other countries' requirements may differ. In some cases, as in that of Harvard University, the distinction is solely administrative (Harvard Business School is not authorized to issue Ph.D.s; only the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may do so).Admissions FAQs Harvard http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/faqs/Pages/default.aspx In other cases, the distinction is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Ph.D. is highly focused on developing original academic knowledge, while the D.B.A. emphasizes applied research.http://www.mba.athabascau.ca/titanweb/au/webcms.nsf/AllDoc/B432DD075D38015987257076007C6B25?Opendocument Athabasca University: DBA vs PhD Upon completion, graduates of Ph.D programs generally migrate to full-time faculty positions in academia, while those of D.B.A. programs re-emerge in industry as applied researchers or executives. If working full-time in industry, graduates of D.B.A. and Ph.D. programs often become adjunct professors in top undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Geographic distribution D.B.A. programs are offered worldwide. The majority, however, are offered in Europe (42 percent), followed by North America (28 percent) and the Asia-Pacific region (22 percent). 6 percent of the programs are offered in Africa and 2 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Life and career Naglee was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 15, 1815. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1835 as 23rd in a class of 56 cadets. Posted in the 5th U.S. Infantry he resigned shortly after his graduation and worked as a civil engineer. Naglee came to California in 1846 during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War as captain of Company D of the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers. Leading a detachment of volunteers to La Paz in Baja California he fought in the Skirmish of Todos Santos where he led 45 mounted soldiers into the Mexican rear, which led to the collapse of their resistance. In the following pursuit he ordered the killing of two captured Mexicans without orders, for which the military governor of Alta California, Colonel Richard B. Mason, ordered Naglee arrested. When President Polk granted a pardon to military and naval offenders acting in wartime, Naglee escaped punishment for this crime. Richard W. Amero, The Journal of San Diego History, The Mexican-American War in Baja California, SAN DIEGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY, Winter 1984, Volume 30, Number 1, note 37. Ryan, pp. 210-211. After his discharge from the army, in 1849, Captain Naglee became the first commanding officer of the 1st California Guards, a California Militia unit in San Francisco, the beginning of what would become the California National Guard. He also entered into a career in banking. In 1858 Naglee left San Francisco to study viticulture in Europe. Later that year, he bought 140 acres (0.570 km2) just east of downtown San Jose, California, where he built an estate and planted vineyards of Riesling and Charbono grapes, from which he distilled brandy. His high-quality brandy and his great viticultural knowledge made him famous as the \\"Father of California's brandy industry\\". In May 1861 Naglee reentered the United States Army as lieutenant colonel of the 16th U.S. Infantry. As the regiment's recruitment took longer and longer Naglee's want for active service made him resign in January 1862. Naglee was made a brigadier general of Volunteers the next month and given command of a brigade in the IV Corps of the Army of the Potomac. on May 31 and June 1. The division, under command of Gen. Silas Casey, was made up of the greenest troops in the army. During the Peninsula Campaign he fought in the Battle of Fair Oaks on May 31. His brigade and the whole division distinguished themselves when they were attacked, but had to fall back in the end. Naglee himself had his horse killed under him and received four wounds from musket- balls. While both praise and blame were given to the division, and Naglee, he wrote a number of reports and letters, increasing his role in the battle, that sparked great criticism and animosity. Later that year he commanded a brigade and a division in North Carolina, participating in the relief of Washington. In 1863 he commanded the VII Corps and the District of Virginia. In 1864 he was mustered out of the army and returned to San Jose to resume banking and brandy making. He also actively campaigned in the election of General McClellan for the Democratic Party. In 1865 he married 24 years old Marie Antoinette Ringgold, the daughter of his friend George Hays Ringgold and descendant to President James Monroe. From this marriage were born two daughters, Marie, in 1866, and Antoinette, in 1869. Mrs. Naglee died in 1869 and Naglee never remarried. In California General Naglee was involved in two very public scandals. In 1865, Mary Schell, whom Naglee had met in 1858 and corresponded with while at war, published his love letters in a book entitled The Love Life of Brigadier General Henry M. Naglee, Consisting of a correspondence on Love, War and Politics, after he broke off their relationship. In 1877 his nanny Emily Hanks filed a lawsuit against Naglee, claiming he proposed marriage to her and then seduced her. This led to two trials and three years of headlines in the local newspapers. The court ruled in Hanks's favor in the first trial, but in Naglee's in the second. Henry Naglee died on illness in San Francisco on March 5, 1886, and is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. His estate was developed into the residential Naglee Park neighborhood in 1902 by his daughters. They erected a stone and brass memorial to Naglee in San Jose's St. James Park, and Naglee Avenue in San Jose was named after him.

In the history of the theatre in Great Britain and Ireland, the designation \\"Theatre Royal\\", or \\"Royal Theatre\\", once meant that a theatre had been granted a royal patent, without which \\"serious drama\\" theatrical performances were not permitted by law. Many such theatres had other names. The first Theatre Royal The first Theatre Royal was opened by John Ogilby in 1662 in Smock Alley. Ogilby, who was the first Irish Master of the Revels, had previously run the New Theatre in Werburgh Street. This was the first custom-built theatre in the city. It opened in 1637 but was closed by the Puritans in 1641. The Restoration of the monarchy in Ireland in 1661 enabled Ogilby to resume his position as Master of the Revels and open his new venture. This Theatre Royal was essentially under the control of the administration in Dublin Castle and staged mainly pro-Stuart works and Shakespearean classics. In 1662 Katherine Philips went to Dublin to pursue her husband's claim to certain Irish estates; there she completed a translation of Pierre Corneille's Pomp√©e, produced with great success in 1663 in the Smock Alley Theatre, and printed in the same year both in Dublin and London. Although other women had translated or written dramas, her translation of Pompey broke new ground as the first rhymed version of a French tragedy in English and the first English play written by a woman to be performed on the professional stage. In the 18th century, the theatre was managed for a time by the actor-manager Thomas Sheridan, father of playwright and politician Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Thomas Sheridan managed to attract major stars of the London stage, including David Garrick and the Dublin-born Peg Woffington. Charlotte Melmoth, later to become 'The Grande Dame of Tragedy on the American Stage' began her acting career at Smock Alley.A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians (Vol 10) The theatre was demolished and rebuilt in 1735 and closed in 1787, falling into dereliction and used as a warehouse for almost 30 years. In 1811 part of the 18th century structure demolished, and what survived was incorporated into the new Church of St. Michael and St. Johns, which remained as one of the most popular Catholic churches in the city centre until 1989. In 2012, after 6 years of building work, the 19th century church building was converted for use as a theatre. The new theatre is home to the Gaiety School of Acting, The National Theatre School of Ireland.See http://smockalley.com/ The second Theatre Royal Crow Street Theatre was opened by Spranger Barry in 1758. The lovers Mary Bulkley and James William Dodd played here in 1774.Saunders's News-Letter, Monday 30 May 1774 p1 col3: Dublin, June 1st, New garden In 1782 the actor Richard Daly became its owner, and in 1786, having obtained a patent from the Crown, he opened the theatre in 1788 as the Theatre Royal. ¬£12,000 had been spent on rebuilding and decoration. It was profitable for a while, but later suffered from the opening of Astley's Amphitheatre Frederick Edward Jones leased the theatre from Daly, and spent ¬£1200 on renovating the house, which was decorated by Marinari and Zaffarini. It was opened in 1796, but closed when martial law was declared, relating to the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Jones obtained a new royal patent in 1798, and spent a further ¬£5000 on the theatre, but in the political climate it had to close in 1803. The theatre was wrecked in a riot of 1814; and there were further riots in 1819. Jones attributed his unpopularity to his being active in politics; in 1807 he had supported the election of an anti- ministerial member of parliament for Dublin. His application in 1818 for renewal of the patent was refused, being granted instead to Henry Harris, a proprietor of Covent Garden Theatre. The third Theatre Royal In 1820, Henry Harris bought a site in Hawkins Street and built the 2,000-seater Albany New Theatre on it at a cost of ¬£50,000, designed by architect Samuel Beazley.Earl, John & Sell, Michael: Guide to British Theatres 1750‚Äì1950 (Theatres Trust, 2000), pp. 268; . This theatre opened in January of the following year. In August, George IV attended a performance at the Albany and, as a consequence, a patent was granted. The name of the theatre was changed to the \\"Theatre Royal\\" to reflect its status as a patent theatre. The building work was not completed at the time of opening and early audience figures were so low that a number of side seating boxes were boarded up. On 14 December 1822, the \\"Bottle Riot\\" occurred during a performance of She Stoops to Conquer attended by the Lord Lieutenant, Marquess Wellesley: Orangemen angered by Wellesley's conciliation of Catholics jeered him during the national anthem, and a riot ensued after a bottle was thrown at him. Wellesley's overreaction, including charging three rioters with attempted murder, undermined his own credibility. In 1830, Harris retired from the theatre and a Mr Calcraft took on the lease. This theatre attracted a number of famous performers, including Paganini, Jenny Lind, Tyrone Power and Barry Sullivan. By 1851, the theatre was experiencing financial problems and closed briefly. It reopened in December under John Harris, who had been manager of the rival Queen's Theatre. The first production under Harris was a play by Dion Boucicault. Boucicault and his wife were to make their first Dublin personal appearances in the Royal in 1861 in his The Colleen Bawn. The first performance of Boucicault's play Arrah-na-Pogue was held at the theatre in 1864, with Boucicault, Samuel Johnson, John Brougham and Samuel Anderson Emery in the cast. This theatre was also noted for its musical performances, which included orchestral overtures and interludes to spoken drama and operatic stagings. The orchestra was conducted by Richard Michael Levey (1811‚Äì1899) between 1834 and the burning of the theatre on 9 February 1880.Beausang, Ita: \\"Levey family\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. Harry White & Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), pp. 588. In March 1874 John and Michael Gunn took ownership of the Theatre Royal from John Harris, who had run it for nearly 25 years. John and Michael Gunn remained joint owners of the Gaiety Theatre, but John managed the Gaiety while Michael managed the Theatre Royal. The fourth Theatre Royal Theatre Royal, Hawkins Street The fourth Theatre Royal opened on 13 December 1897 by the actor-manager Frederick Mouillot with the assistance of a group of Dublin businessmen. The theatre was designed by Frank Matcham and built on the site of the Leinster Hall theatre, which in turn had been built on the site of the third Theatre Royal. It had seating for an audience of 2,011 people. This new theatre found itself in competition with the Gaiety Theatre, which prompted Mouillot to try to attract as many big name stars and companies as possible. At first, the theatre was noted for its opera and musical comedy productions. On 28 April 1904, Edward VII attended a state performance at the theatre. Mouillot died in 1911 and one of his partners, David Tellford took over the running of the theatre. As musical comedy went out of fashion in the early years of the 20th century, the Royal started to stage music hall shows on a regular basis. In one such show in 1906, a young Charlie Chaplin performed as part of an act called The Eight Lancashire Lads. In its final years, the Theatre was also used as a cinema. It closed on 3 March 1934 and demolished soon after. Theatre poster from 1916 The fifth Theatre Royal 1960s image of the Theatre Royal, Hawkins Street The fifth Theatre Royal opened on 23 September 1935 in Hawkins Street. It was a large art deco building designed for an audience of 3,700 people seated and 300 standing, and was intended for use as both theatre and cinema. It also housed the Regal Rooms Restaurant (converted into the Regal Rooms Cinema in 1938). The theatre had a resident 25-piece orchestra under the direction of Jimmy Campbell and a troupe of singer-dancers, the Royalettes. From the beginning, the sheer size of the building made it difficult for the Royal to remain economically viable. The policy adopted at first to confront this problem was to book big-name stars from overseas to fill the building. These included Gracie Fields, George Formby, Max Wall, Max Miller and Jimmy Durante. However these shows rarely made a profit. In 1936, the Royal was acquired by Patrick Wall and Louis Elliman, who also owned the Gaiety. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Wall and Elliman were forced to keep the two theatres going with native talent only. This led to the emergence of a raft of Irish acts who were to provide the mainstay of the Royal's output for the remainder of its existence. These included such Irish household names as Jimmy O'Dea, Harry O'Donovan, Maureen Potter, Danny Cummins, Mike Nolan, Alice Dalgarno, Noel Purcell, Miche√°l Mac Liamm√≥ir, Cecil Sheridan, Jack Cruise, Paddy Crosbie and Patricia Cahill. In July 1951 Judy Garland appeared for a series of sold out performances and was received with tremendous ovations. The legendary singer sang from her dressing room window to hundreds of people who were unable to get tickets and critics dubbed her \\"America's Colleen\\". She drew the largest crowds up until that time and was only surpassed by the visits to Ireland of United States President John F. Kennedy in 1963 and Pope John Paul II in 1979. Popular Irish American entertainer Carmel Quinn also made her singing debut here during the early 1950s. Under pressure from rising overheads and the increasing popularity of the cinema and the introduction of television, the fifth Theatre Royal, Dublin closed its doors on 30 June 1962. The building was subsequently demolished and replaced by a twelve-storey office block, Hawkins House, which was the headquarters of Ireland's Department of Health until 2019. In 1972 The New Metropole, opened on the corner of Hawkins Street and Townsend Street on the site of The Regal Rooms. It operated as the Screen Cinema from 1984 until 2016.https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/screen-cinema- in-dublin-to-close-after-35-years-1.2540348 The building was demolished in 2019.

Olten's railway station is within 30 minutes of Z√ºrich, Basel, Bern, and Lucerne by train, and is a rail hub of Switzerland. History Peasant woman from Olten in traditional costume (c. 1800). Aerial view from 400 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1919) Significant amounts of artefacts of the Magdalenian (c. 16'000 to 14'000 years ago) have been excavated near Olten. There are also finds dated to the Mesolithic and Neolithic, but there is no trace of a settlement, and no ceramic finds; finds dating to the Bronze and Iron Ages are also rather limited. There was a vicus at the site during the Roman era. The name of the settlement is not known, but it seems to have been of a certain importance, presumably reflecting the presence of a bridge across the Aar River. The Roman settlement was probably destroyed in the later 3rd century. At the end of the 3rd century, a fortification was built at the bridge-head, on the south-eastern corner of the earlier vicus. This fortress was abandoned in the 4th century, and later replaced by a larger castle, comparable to late Roman fortresses protecting crossings of the Aar at Solothurn and Brugg. The medieval settlement was built on the foundations of the Roman castle. It is first mentioned in 1201, as Oltun (conjectured as continuing an *Olodunum, with the Gaulish suffix dunum \\"fort\\", and a prefix olo-, possibly from a hydronym, thus \\"river-fort\\").Der Geschichtsfreund: Mitteilungen des Historischen Vereins der f√ºnf Orte Luzern, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden und Zug, vols. 126-130 (1974), p. 257. It was in possession of the counts of Frohburg in the 13th century, passing to Kyburg in 1377 and to Habsburg in 1384. Olten passed under the administration of Basel in 1407, which invested in infrastructure, which was however destroyed in fires in 1411 and 1422. Basel lost interest in rebuilding the town again after the 1422 fire, and sold the settlement to Solothurn in 1426. Throughout the medieval period, Olten was little more than a fortified bridge-head with some services (blacksmiths, taverns); its total population is estimated to about 500 people for the year 1600. Olten lost its city rights in 1653 as punishment for its support of the rebels in the Swiss Peasant War. This resulted in a lasting tradition of resistance against authority in Olten, and the town welcomed as liberators the French troops in the 1798 invasion. In 1814, Solothurn suppressed another rebellion of Olten patriots against the Swiss Restauration. Olten first reached a population of 1,000 in the later 18th century. More rapid growth set in after the introduction of the railway in 1856, and the town became an industrial and infrastructural center, reaching 7,000 by 1900. By the 1880s, Olten had developed into a second urban center in the canton, and attracted more infrastructure such as the cantonal hospital (1880), a business school (1912), a cantonal gymnasium (1938). Population tripled again during the 20th century, reaching 21,000 in 1970, but has slightly decreased since. Geography Aare river at the old city of Olten Olten has an area, , of .

The old city of the capital of the Olten district is located in a bend of the river between the Aare and D√ºnnern rivers. In the 19th Century housing estates were built in the valley on both sides of the Aare river between slopes of the Jura Mountains to the north and the Born, S√§li und Engelberg mountains to the south.

Davies spent a significant part of his life as a tramp or hobo, in the United Kingdom and United States, but still became one of the most popular poets of his time. The principal themes in his work are observations about life's hardships, the ways in which the human condition is reflected in nature, his tramping adventures, and the various characters he met. Davies is usually classed as one of the Georgian Poets, although much of his work is not typical of the group in either style or theme.Normand, L. (2003), W. H. Davies, Bridgend: Poetry Wales Press Ltd. Life and career = Early life= Plaque commemorating Davies' supposed place of birth, at \\"The Church House Inn\\", in Pillgwenlly, Newport, Wales. The son of an iron moulder, Davies was born at 6, Portland Street in the Pillgwenlly district of Newport, Monmouthshire, a busy port. He had an older brother, Francis Gomer Boase (who was considered \\"slow\\") and in 1874 his younger sister Matilda was born. In November 1874, when William was aged three, his father died. The following year his mother Mary Anne Davies remarried and became Mrs Joseph Hill. She agreed that care of the three children should pass to their paternal grandparents, Francis and Lydia Davies, who ran the nearby Church House Inn at 14, Portland Street. His grandfather Francis Boase Davies, originally from Cornwall, had been a sea captain. Davies was related to the famous British actor Sir Henry Irving (referred to as cousin Brodribb by the family); he later recalled that his grandmother referred to Irving as \\" the cousin who brought disgrace on us\\". Davies' grandmother was described, by a neighbour who remembered her, as wearing \\".. pretty little caps, with bebe ribbon, tiny roses and puce trimmings\\".F. J. Hando, The Pleasant Land of Gwent, 1944, R. H. Johns, Newport. Writing in his Introduction to the 1943 Collected Poems of W. H. Davies, Osbert Sitwell recalled Davies telling him that, in addition to his grandparents and himself, his home consisted of \\"an imbecile brother, a sister;... a maidservant, a dog, a cat, a parrot, a dove and a canary bird.\\" Sitwell also recounts that Davies' grandmother, a Baptist by denomination, was \\"of a more austere and religious turn of mind than her husband.\\"Collected Poems of W. H. Davies, London: Jonathan Cape (3rd impression 1943), pp. xxi‚Äìxxviii, \\"Introduction\\" by Osbert Sitwell. In 1879 the family moved to Raglan Street, then to Upper Lewis Street, from where William attended Temple School. In 1883 he moved to Alexandra Road School and the following year was arrested, as one of a gang of five schoolmates, and charged with stealing handbags. He was given twelve strokes of the birch. In 1885 Davies wrote his first poem entitled \\"Death\\". In his Poet's Pilgrimage (1918) Davies recounts the time when, at the age of 14, he was left with orders to sit with his dying grandfather. He missed the final moments of his grandfather's death as he was too engrossed in reading \\"a very interesting book of wild adventure\\".Davies, W. H. (1918), A Poet's Pilgrimage, London: Melrose, pp. 42‚Äì44. =Delinquent to \\"supertramp\\"= After school, he worked as an ironmonger. In November 1886, his grandmother signed the papers for Davies to begin a five-year apprenticeship to a local picture-frame maker. Davies never enjoyed the craft. He left Newport, took casual work, and began his travels. The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp, published in 1908, covers his life in the United States between 1893 and 1899, including many adventures and characters from his travels as a drifter. During this period, he crossed the Atlantic at least seven times on cattle ships. He travelled through many of the states doing seasonal work. He took advantage of the corrupt system of \\"boodle\\", to pass the winter in Michigan, by agreeing to be locked in a series of jails. Here, with his fellow tramps, Davies enjoyed the relative comfort of \\"card-playing, singing, smoking, reading, relating experiences, and occasionally taking exercise or going out for a walk.\\"Hockey, L. (1971), W. H. Davies, University of Wales Press (on behalf of the Welsh Arts Council), p. 16. At one point on his way to Memphis, Tennessee, he lay alone in a swamp for three days and nights suffering from malaria. The turning point in Davies' life came after a week of rambling in London. He spotted a newspaper story about the riches to be made in the Klondike, and immediately set off to make his fortune in Canada. Attempting to jump a freight train at Renfrew, Ontario, on 20 March 1899, with fellow tramp Three-fingered Jack, he lost his footing and his right foot was crushed under the wheels of the train. The leg was amputated below the knee, and he wore a peg-leg thereafter. Davies' biographers agreed the significance of the accident was significant, although Davies played down the story. Moult begins his biography with the incident,Moult, T. (1934), W. H. Davies, London: Thornton Butterworth. and Stonesifer suggested that this event, more than any other, led Davies to become a professional poet.Stonesifer, R. J. (1963), W. H. Davies ‚Äì A Critical Biography, London: Jonathan Cape, ISBN B0000CLPA3 (first full biography of Davies). Davies writes of the accident: \\"I bore this accident with an outward fortitude that was far from the true state of my feelings. Thinking of my present helplessness caused me many a bitter moment, but I managed to impress all comers with a false indifference.... I was soon home again, away less than four months; but all the wildness was taken out of me, and my adventures after this were not of my seeking, but the result of circumstances.\\" Davies, W. H. (1908), The Autobiography of a Super Tramp, London: Fifield, Chapter XX: \\"Hospitality\\". Davies's view of his disability was ambivalent. In his poem \\"The Fog\\", published in the 1913 Foliage, a blind man leads the poet through the fog, showing the reader one who is handicapped in one domain may well have a considerable advantage in another. =Poet= He returned to Britain, living a rough life, particularly in London shelters and doss-houses, including the Salvation Army hostel in Southwark known as \\"The Ark\\" which he grew to despise. Fearing the contempt of his fellow tramps, he often feigned slumber in the corner of his doss-house, mentally composing his poems, then later committing them to paper in private. At one point, he borrowed money to print his poems he sold door-to-door through the streets of residential London. After this enterprise failed, he returned to his lodgings, and burned all of the printed sheets. Davies self-published his first book of poetry, The Soul's Destroyer, in 1905, again by means of his savings. It proved to be the beginning of success and a growing reputation. To publish the slim volume, Davies forwent his allowance to live as a tramp for six months (with the first draft of the book hidden in his pocket), just to secure a loan of funds from his inheritance. After it was published, the volume was ignored. He resorted to posting individual copies by hand to prospective wealthy customers chosen from the pages of Who's Who, asking them to send the price of the book, a half crown, in return. He sold 60 of the 200 copies printed. One of the copies was sent to Arthur Adcock, then a journalist with the Daily Mail. On reading the book, as he later wrote in his essay \\"Gods of Modern Grub Street\\", Adcock said he \\"recognised there were crudities and doggerel in it, there was also in it some of the freshest and most magical poetry to be found in modern books.\\" He sent the price of the book, then asked Davies to meet him. Adcock is regarded as \\"the man who discovered Davies.\\" The first trade edition of The Soul's Destroyer was published by Alston Rivers in 1907. A second edition followed in 1908 and a third in 1910. A 1906 edition, by Fifield, was advertised but has not been verified.(Harlow, 1993). =Rural life in Kent= On 12 October 1905 Davies met Edward Thomas, then literary critic for the Daily Chronicle in London, who was to do more to help him than anyone else. Thomas rented for Davies the tiny two-roomed \\"Stidulph's Cottage\\", in Egg Pie Lane, not far from his own home at Elses Farm near Sevenoaks in Kent. Davies moved to the cottage from 6 Llanwern Street, Newport, via London, in the second week of February 1907. The cottage was \\"only two meadows off\\" from Thomas's own house.Davies, W. H. (1914), Nature, London: Batsford, Chapter I. Thomas adopted the role of protective guardian for Davies, on one occasion even arranging for the manufacture, by a local wheelwright, of a makeshift replacement wooden leg, which was invoiced to Davies as \\"a novelty cricket bat\\". In 1907, the manuscript of The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp drew the attention of George Bernard Shaw, who agreed to write a preface (largely through the efforts of his wife Charlotte). It was only because of Shaw that Davies' contract with the publishers was rewritten to allow the author to retain the serial rights, all rights after three years, royalties of 15 per cent of selling price, and a non-returnable advance of ¬£25. Davies was also to be given a say on the style of all illustrations, advertisement layouts and cover designs. The original publisher, Duckworth and Sons, rejected these terms, and so the book was placed instead with the London publisher Fifield. A number of anecdotes of Davies's time with the Thomas family in Kent are recounted in the brief account later published by Thomas's widow Helen.Thomas, Helen. (1973), A Memory of W. H. Davies, Edinburgh, Tragara Press, . In 1911, Davies was awarded a Civil List Pension of ¬£50, later increased to ¬£100 and then again to ¬£150. Davies started to spend more time in London and made many literary friends and acquaintances. Though averse to giving autographs himself, Davies began to make a collection of his own and was particularly keen to obtain that of D. H. Lawrence. Georgian poetry publisher Edward Marsh was able to secure an autograph and also invited Lawrence and wife-to-be Frieda to meet Davies on 28 July 1913. Lawrence was immediately captivated by Davies and later invited him to join them in Germany. Despite his early enthusiasm for Davies' work, however, Lawrence's opinion changed after reading Foliage and he commented after reading Nature Poems in Italy that the verses seemed \\"so thin, one can hardly feel them.\\" By this time Davies had a library of about fifty books in his cottage, most of them 16th and 17th-century poets, and including Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Byron, Burns, Shelley, Keats, Coleridge, Blake and Herrick. In December 1908 his essay \\"How It Feels To Be Out of Work\\", described by Stonesifer as \\"a rather pedestrian performance\\", appeared in the pages of The English Review. He continued to send other periodical articles out to editors, but without success. =Social life in London= After lodging at a number of temporary addresses in Sevenoaks, Davies moved back to London early in 1914, settling eventually at 14 Great Russell Street in the Bloomsbury district, previously the residence of Charles Dickens. Here in a tiny two-room apartment, initially infested with mice and rats, and next door to rooms occupied by a noisy Belgian prostitute, he lived from early 1916 until 1921. It was during this time in London that Davies embarked on a series of public readings of his work, alongside such others as Hilaire Belloc and W. B. Yeats, impressing fellow poet Ezra Pound. He soon found that he was able to socialise with leading society figures of the day, including Arthur Balfour and Lady Randolph Churchill. While in London Davies also became friendly with a number of artists, including Jacob Epstein, Harold and Laura Knight, Nina Hamnett, Augustus John, Harold Gilman, William Rothenstein, Walter Sickert, Sir William Nicholson and Osbert and Edith Sitwell. He enjoyed the society of literary men and their conversation, particularly in the rarefied downstairs at the Caf√© Royal. He would also meet regularly with W. H. Hudson, Edward Garrett and others at The Mont Blanc in Soho. For his poetry Davies drew extensively on his experiences with the seamier side of life, but also on his love of nature. By the time of his prominent place in the Edward Marsh Georgian Poetry series, he was an established figure. He is generally best known for the opening two lines of the poem \\"Leisure\\", first published in Songs of Joy and Others in 1911: \\"What is this life if, full of care / We have no time to stand and stare....\\" In October 1917 his work was included in the anthology Welsh Poets: A Representative English selection from Contemporary Writers collated by A. G. Prys-Jones and published by Erskine Macdonald of London. In the last months of 1921, Davies moved to more comfortable quarters at 13 Avery Row, Brook Street, where he rented rooms from the Quaker poet Olaf Baker. He began to find prolonged work difficult, however, suffering from increased bouts of rheumatism and other ailments. Harlow (1993) lists a total of 14 BBC broadcasts of Davies reading his own work made between 1924 and 1940 (now held in the BBC broadcast archive)Harlow, S. (1993), W. H. Davies ‚Äì A Bibliography, Winchester, Oak Knoll Books, St.Paul's Bibliographies. although none included his most famous work, \\"Leisure\\". Later Days, the 1925 sequel to The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp, describes the beginnings of Davies's career as a writer and his acquaintance with Belloc, Shaw, de la Mare and many others. He became \\"the most painted literary man of his day\\", thanks to Augustus John, Sir William Nicholson, Dame Laura Knight and Sir William Rothenstein. His head in bronze was the most successful of Epstein's smaller works. =Marriage and later life= Davies' last home \\"Glendower\\", Watledge Road, Nailsworth, Gloucestershire On 5 February 1923, Davies married 23-year- old Helen Matilda Payne, at the Registry Office in East Grinstead, Sussex, and the couple set up home in the town at \\"Tor Leven\\", Cantelupe Road. According to one of the witnesses, Conrad Aiken, the ceremony proceeded with Davies \\"in a near panic\\".The marriage certificate gives Davies' occupation as \\"An Author\\", that of his father (sic) as \\"Able Seaman\\" and that of Helen's father as \\"Farmer\\". His book Young Emma was a frank and often disturbing account of his life before and after picking Helen up at a bus-stop in the Edgware Road near Marble Arch. He had caught sight of her just getting off the bus and describes her wearing a \\"saucy-looking little velvet cap with tassels\\". Still unmarried, Helen was pregnant at the time.Stonesifier describes Helen as \\"a twenty-two-year-old Sussex girl, a nurse in a hospital to which he was sent for treatment\\" when Davies was very ill in the spring of 1922. While Dame Veronica Wedgwood, in her preface to the book, describes Helen as \\"a country girl who had come to London, become pregnant by a man whom she could not marry, was without resources and afraid to go back to her people.\\" While living with Davies in London, before the couple were married, Helen suffered a dramatic and almost fatal miscarriage. Although Davies eagerly sent the manuscript for Young Emma to Jonathan Cape in August 1924, he later changed his mind and asked for the manuscript to be returned and the copies destroyed. Only Davies' lack of direct instruction prompted Cape to secretly keep the copies in a locked safe. Later, after Davies' death, when asked by Cape for his advice, George Bernard Shaw advised against publication, and the book was eventually published only after Helen's death in 1979.Davies, W. H. (1980), Young Emma, Sevenoaks: Hodder and Stoughton Ltd, . The couple lived quietly and happily, moving from East Grinstead, first to Sevenoaks, then to \\"Malpas House\\", Oxted in Surrey and finally to a series of five different residences at Nailsworth in Gloucestershire. The first of these was the comfortable detached 19th-century stone-built house \\"Axpills\\" (later known as \\"Shenstone\\"), with a garden of some character. In the last seven years of his life he lived in four different houses, all within a mile and the first three all within of one another. His last home was the small roadside cottage \\"Glendower\\" in the hamlet of Watledge. The couple had no children. In 1930 Davies edited the poetry anthology Jewels of Song for Cape, choosing works by more than 120 different poets, and including William Blake, Thomas Campion, William Shakespeare, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and W. B. Yeats. Of his own poems he selected only \\"The Kingfisher\\" and \\"Leisure\\". The collection was re- published as An Anthology of Short Poems in 1938. =Decline and death= Davies returned to Newport, in September 1938, for the unveiling of a plaque in his honour at the Church House Inn, and with an address given by the Poet Laureate John Masefield. He was still unwell, however, and this proved to be his last public appearance. Before his marriage to Helen, Davies would regularly visit London and stay with Osbert Sitwell and his brother Sacheverell. He particularly enjoyed walking with them along the river from the Houses of Parliament to the Physic Garden, near to their house, in Chelsea. During his visits Davies would often call, on a Sunday afternoon, to hear recitals on the harpsichord and clavichord given by Violet Gordon Woodhouse. Having moved to Watledge the Davieses continued to visit Gordon Woodhouse, at her house in Nether Lypiatt, near Stroud, to dine with the Sitwells. About three months before he died, Davies was visited at Glendower by Gordon Woodhouse and the Sitwells, Davies being too ill to travel to dinner at Nether Lypiatt. Osbert Sitwell noted that Davies looked \\"very ill\\" but that \\"his head, so typical of him in its rustic and nautical boldness, with the black hair now greying a little, but as stiff as ever, surrounding his high bony forehead, seemed to have acquired an even more sculptural quality.\\" Helen privately explained to Sitwell that Davies' heart showed \\"alarming symptoms of weakness\\" caused, according to his doctors, by the continuous dragging weight of his wooden leg. Helen had been careful to keep the true extent of the medical diagnosis from her husband. Davies himself confided in Sitwell: > I've never been ill before, really, except when I had that accident and lost > my leg.... And, d'you know, I grow so irritable when I've got that pain, I > can't bear the sound of people's voices.... Sometimes I feel I should like > to turn over on my side and die. Davies' health continued to deteriorate and he died, in September 1940, at the age of 69. Never a church-goer in his adult life, Davies was cremated at Cheltenham and his remains interred there. =Glendower= From 1949, \\"Glendower\\" was the home of the poet's great nephew Norman Phillips. In 2003, Phillips suffered a heart attack and was forced to move into council accommodation. He subsequently spent ¬£34,000 on the house, hoping to move back, but faced a further five figure sum for essential maintenance. Local residents, including Anthony Burton and biographer Barbara Hooper, formed \\"The Friends of Glendower\\" to help save the property and promote the poet's work. Stroud District Council, however, had already voted to embark on the process of obtaining a Compulsory Purchase Order. In 2010, \\"The Friends of Glendower\\" arranged a series of lectures, exhibitions, walks and other events, in Nailsworth and Stroud, between 13 and 26 September to mark the 70th anniversary of the poet's death. In December 2012 a number of Davies' books, signed by the author, were found during restoration of the cottage which had been instigated by the Friends of Glendower. The first phase of restoration was due to be completed in 2013, making part of the house habitable once more. Five signed books were found, in a wardrobe in one of the bedrooms, together with letters from Davies to family members. The Friends hoped that the books would remain in Nailsworth and that the cottage might become a Davies study- centre, using the collection of books, manuscripts and belongings that had remained in the family. The plans would include use of the cottage as a home by Phillips, who was one of the last remaining direct descendants of the Davies family. Literary style Davies' principal biographer Stonesifer likens the quality of Davies' prose, with its often childlike realism, directness and simplicity, to that of Defoe and George Borrow. Davies' style was described by Shaw as that of \\"a genuine innocent\\", while Hockey says: > \\"It is as a poet of nature that Davies has become most famous; and it is not > surprising that he should have taken nature as his main subject. He had > lived close to the earth and in the open air, and had grown to love the > countryside with its fields, woods and streams, its hedges and flowers, its > birds and beasts, bees and butterflies, its sunny and cloudy skies and > capricious moods: in short its infinite variety. Though a man of limited > education, here he was at no disadvantage with an intellectual; for > appreciation of nature is based not on intellect but on love and Davies > loved nature deeply. His nature poetry is founded on his delight in nature, > and he exulted in revealing the loveliness of heaven and earth and his > interest in the creatures of the countryside. As does a child, a pagan or a > mystic, he glorified nature and never ceased to regard it with eyes of > wonder\\".Hockey, L. (1971), W. H. Davies, University of Wales Press (on > behalf of the Welsh Arts Council), p. 89. For his honorary degree in 1926, Davies was introduced to the assembly at the University of Wales by Professor W. D. Thomas with a citation that may still serve as a summary of Davies' themes, style and tone: > \\"A Welshman, a poet of distinction, and a man in whose work much of the > peculiarly Welsh attitude to life is expressed with singular grace and > sincerity. He combines a vivid sense of beauty with affection for the > homely, keen zest for life and adventure with a rare appreciation of the > common, universal pleasures, and finds in those simple things of daily life > a precious quality, a dignity and a wonder that consecrate them. Natural, > simple and unaffected, he is free from sham in feeling and artifice in > expression. He has re-discovered for those who have forgotten them, the joys > of simple nature. He has found romance in that which has become commonplace; > and of the native impulses of an unspoilt heart, and the responses of a > sensitive spirit, he has made a new world of experience and delight. He is a > lover of life, accepting it and glorying in it. He affirms values that were > falling into neglect, and in an age that is mercenary reminds us that we > have the capacity for spiritual enjoyment.\\" Somewhat surprisingly, his great friend and mentor, Edward Thomas, likened Davies to Wordsworth, writing: \\"He can write commonplace or inaccurate English, but it is also natural to him to write, such as Wordsworth wrote, with the clearness, compactness and felicity which make a man think with shame how unworthily, through natural stupidity or uncertainty, he manages his native tongue. In subtlety he abounds, and where else today shall we find simplicity like this?\\"quoted in Howarth, P., (2003) English Literature in Transition 1880‚Äì1920, Vol. 46. Daniel George, who reviewed the 1943 Collected Poems for Tribune, describes Davies' work, in his Foreword to the 1963 edition as \\"new yet old, recalling now Herrick, now Blake ‚Äì of whom it was said, as of Goldsmith, that he wrote like angel but (according to those who had met him) talked like poor Poll, except that he was no parrot of other people's opinions.\\"The Complete Poems of W. H. Davies (ed. Daniel George), London: Jonathan Cape, 1963, pp. xxv‚Äìxxvi, \\"Foreword\\". Appearance and character Osbert Sitwell, who was a close friend of Davies, thought that he bore an \\"unmistakable likeness\\" to his distant actor cousin Henry Irving. Sitwell provides a vivid description of the poet's physical appearance: > His cast of face was rather long and aquiline, but with broad high cheek > bones, and all of it, chin, mouth, long upper lip, nose, and high forehead, > was finely sculptured and full of character. Features and hair both > exhibited a naturally proud, backward slant or tilt, though there was no > arrogance in him. His eyes were dark and gleaming, like those of a > blackbird, and his skin possessed an almost nautical tinge. He was broad- > shouldered and vigorous looking, but of less than middle height. Having lost > a leg, he wore ‚Äì for he could not afford the expense of a new metal limb ‚Äì a > heavy wooden stump, which made a wooden sound as he walked, and gave him a > slow and very personal gait, making him raise and dip his shoulders as he > moved. Writing in the Introduction to his 1951 The Essential W. H. Davies, Brian Waters said of Davies that \\"character and personality rather than good looks were the keynote to his expressive face,\\" continuing: > Most people who never knew him have come to look on Davies as a Welshman. He > was neither Welsh nor English, but an ancient Briton in whom the tribal > character of the Silurian stock has persisted into the present century ‚Äì a > type frequently recognisable in Monmouthshire. He knew no word of Welsh, he > was not carried away by the sentiments of others and the mass emotionalism > was foreign to his nature. His emotions and sympathies were his own and he > translated then into his poetry.Waters, B. (ed) (1951), The Essential W. H. > Davies, London: Jonathan Cape, (Introduction: W. H. Davies, Man and Poet, > pp. 9‚Äì20) Honours, memorials and legacy In 1926 Davies was honoured with the degree of Doctor Litteris, honoris causa from the University of Wales. Davies returned to his native Newport in 1930, where a luncheon was held in his honour at the Westgate Hotel. His return, in September 1938, for the unveiling of the plaque in his honour, proved to be his last public appearance. A large collection of Davies manuscripts, including a copy of \\"Leisure\\", dated 8 May 1914, is held by the National Library of Wales. The collection includes a copy of \\"A Boy's Sorrow\\", an apparently unpublished poem of two eight-line stanzas relating to the death of a neighbour. Also included is a volume (c. 1916) containing autograph fair copies of 15 Davies poems, some of them apparently unpublished, submitted to James Guthrie (1874‚Äì1952) for publication by the Pear Tree Press as a collection entitled Quiet Streams, to which annotations have been added by Lord Kenyon. British writer Gerald Brenan (1894‚Äì1987) and his generation were influenced by Davies' Autobiography of a Super-Tramp. In 1951 Jonathan Cape published The Essential W. H. Davies, selected and with an introduction by Brian Waters, a young Gloucestershire poet and writer whose work Davies admired, who described him as \\"about the last of England's professional poets\\". The collection included The Autobiography of a Super- tramp, and extracts from Beggars, A Poet's Pilgrimage, Later Days, My Birds and My Garden, as well as over 100 poems arranged by publication period. Many of Davies' poems have been given a musical setting. \\"Money, O!\\" was set to music for piano, in G minor, by Michael Head ‚Äì his 1929 Boosey & Hawkes collection also included settings for \\"The Likeness\\", \\"The Temper of a Maid\\", \\"Natures' Friend\\", \\"Robin Redbreast\\" and \\"A Great Time\\". \\"A Great Time\\" has also been set by Otto Freudenthal (b.1934), Wynn Hunt (b.1910) and Newell Wallbank (b.1914). There are also three songs by Sir Arthur Bliss ‚Äì \\"Thunderstorms\\", \\"This Night\\", and \\"Leisure\\" ‚Äì as well as \\"The Rain\\" for voice and piano, by Margaret Campbell Bruce, published in 1951 by J. Curwen and Sons. Experimental Irish folk group Dr. Strangely Strange also sang and quoted from \\"Leisure\\" on their 1970 album Heavy Petting, with harmonium accompaniment. A musical adaptation of the same poem, with John Karvelas (vocals) and Nick Pitloglou (piano) and an animated film by Pipaluk Polanksi, may be found on YouTube. Also in 1970, Fleetwood Mac recorded \\"Dragonfly\\", a song with lyrics taken from Davies' 1927 poem, \\"The Dragonfly\\". The song was also recorded by English singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Blake, for his 2011 album The First Snow. On 1 July 1971 a First Day Cover, with a matching commemorative post-mark was issued by the UK Post Office to mark Davies' centenary. A controversial statue by Paul Bothwell-Kincaid, inspired by the poem \\"Leisure\\", was unveiled in Commercial Street, Newport in December 1990, to commemorate Davies' work, on the 50th anniversary of his death. The bronze head of Davies by Epstein, from January 1917, regarded by many as the most accurate artistic impression of Davies and a copy of which Davies owned himself, may be found at Newport Museum and Art Gallery (donated by Viscount Tredegar). In August 2010 the play Supertramp, Sickert and Jack the Ripper by Lewis Davies, concerning an imagined sitting by Davies for a portrait by Walter Sickert, received its premi√®re at the Edinburgh Festival.

During the Cold War era, Turkey saw political violence (1976‚Äì1980) between far-left and far-right and islamist militant groups and the state.: Colonel Talat Turhan accused the United States for having fuelled the brutality from which Turkey suffered in the 1970s by setting up the Special Warfare Department, the Counter-Guerrilla secret army and the MIT and training them according to FM 30‚Äì31 The violence saw a sharp downturn for a period after the coup, which was welcomed by some for restoring order by quickly executing 50 people and arresting 500,000, hundreds of whom would die in prison. For the next three years the Turkish Armed Forces ruled the country through the National Security Council, before democracy was restored with the 1983 Turkish general election.Amnesty International, Turkey: Human Rights Denied, London, November 1988, AI Index: EUR/44/65/88, , pg. 1. This period saw an intensification of the Turkish nationalism of the state, including banning the Kurdish language.https://carnegieendowment.org/2017/07/10/turkey-s-kurdish-conflict- and-retreat-from-democracy- pub-71453https://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/10/pkk.profile/index.htmlhttps://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/turkey- s-dtp-says-1980-coup-waged-cultural-genocide-on-kurds-10172187 Prelude In 1975 S√ºleyman Demirel, president of the conservative Justice Party (, AP) succeeded B√ºlent Ecevit, president of the social-democratic Republican People's Party (, CHP) as Prime Minister. He formed a coalition with the Nationalist Front (), Necmettin Erbakan's Islamist National Salvation Party (, MSP), and Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü' far-right Nationalist Movement Party (, MHP). The MHP used the opportunity to infiltrate state security services, seriously aggravating the low-intensity war that was waging between rival factions.Gil, Ata. \\"La Turquie √† marche forc√©e,\\" Le Monde diplomatique, February 1981. The elections of 1977 had no winner. At first, Demirel continued the coalition with the Nationalist Front. But in 1978, Ecevit was able to come to power again with the help of some deputies who had moved from one party to another. In 1979, Demirel once again became Prime Minister. At the end of the 1970s, Turkey was in an unstable situation with unsolved economic and social problems facing strike actions and the partial paralysis of parliamentary politics (the Grand National Assembly of Turkey was unable to elect a president during the six months preceding the coup). Since 1968‚Äì69, a proportional representation system had made it difficult for any one party to achieve a parliamentary majority. The interests of the industrial bourgeoisie, which held the largest holdings of the country, were opposed by other social classes such as smaller industrialists, traders, rural notables, and landlords, whose interests did not always coincide among themselves. Numerous agricultural and industrial reforms sought by parts of the middle upper classes were blocked by others. The politicians seemed unable to stem the growing violence in the country. Unprecedented political violence had erupted in Turkey in the late 1970s. The overall death toll of the 1970s is estimated at 5,000, with nearly ten assassinations per day. Most were members of left-wing and right-wing political organizations, then engaged in bitter fighting. The ultra- nationalist Grey Wolves, the youth organisation of the MHP, claimed they were supporting the security forces. According to the anti-fascist Searchlight magazine, in 1978 there were 3,319 fascist attacks, in which 831 were killed and 3,121 wounded. In the central trial against the left-wing organization Devrimci Yol (Revolutionary Path) at Ankara Military Court, the defendants listed 5,388 political killings before the military coup. Among the victims were 1,296 right-wingers and 2,109 left-wingers. Other killings couldn't be definitely connected, but were most likely politically inspired.Devrimci Yol Savunmasƒ± (Defense of the Revolutionary Path). Ankara, January 1989, p. 118-119. The 1977 Taksim Square massacre, the 1978 Bah√ßelievler massacre, and the 1978 Mara≈ü massacre stood out. Following the Mara≈ü massacre, martial law was announced in 14 of (then) 67 provinces in December 1978. By the time of the coup, it had been extended to 20 provinces. Ecevit was warned about the coming coup in June 1979 by Nuri G√ºnde≈ü of the National Intelligence Organization (Mƒ∞T). Ecevit then told his interior minister, ƒ∞rfan √ñzaydƒ±nlƒ±, who then told Sedat Celasun‚Äîone of the five generals who would lead the coup. The deputy undersecretary of the Mƒ∞T, Nihat Yƒ±ldƒ±z, was demoted to the London consulate and replaced by a lieutenant general as a result. Coup On 11 September 1979, General Kenan Evren ordered a hand-written report from full general Haydar Saltƒ±k on whether a coup was in order or the government merely needed a stern warning. The report, which recommended preparing for a coup, was delivered in six months. Evren kept the report in his office safe. Evren says the only other person beside Saltƒ±k who was aware of the details was Nurettin Ersin. It has been argued that this was a ploy on Evren's part to encompass the political spectrum as Saltƒ±k was close to the left, while Ersin took care of the right. Backlash from political organizations after the coup would therefore be prevented. On 21 December, the War Academy generals convened to decide the course of action. The pretext for the coup was to put an end to the social conflicts of the 1970s, as well as the parliamentary instability. They resolved to issue the party leaders (S√ºleyman Demirel and B√ºlent Ecevit) a memorandum by way of the president, Fahri Korut√ºrk, which was done on 27 December. The leaders received the letter a week later. A second report, submitted in March 1980, recommended undertaking the coup without further delay, otherwise apprehensive lower-ranked officers might be tempted to \\"take the matter into their own hands\\". Evren made only minor amendments to Saltƒ±k's plan, titled \\"Operation Flag\\" (). The coup was planned to take place on 11 July 1980, but was postponed after a motion to put Demirel's government to a vote of confidence was rejected on 2 July. At the Supreme Military Council meeting () on 26 August, a second date was proposed: 12 September. On 7 September 1980, Evren and the four service commanders decided that they would overthrow the civilian government. On 12 September, the National Security Council (, MGK), headed by Evren declared coup d'√©tat on the national channel. The MGK then extended martial law throughout the country, abolished the Parliament and the government, suspended the Constitution and banned all political parties and trade unions. They invoked the Kemalist tradition of state secularism and in the unity of the nation, which had already justified the precedent coups, and presented themselves as opposed to communism, fascism, separatism and religious sectarianism. =Economy= One of the coup's most visible effects was on the economy. On the day of the coup, it was on the verge of collapse, with three digit inflation. There was large-scale unemployment, and a chronic foreign trade deficit. The economic changes between 1980 and 1983 were credited to Turgut √ñzal, who was the main person responsible for the economic policy by the Demirel Destined administration since 24 January 1980. √ñzal supported the IMF, and to this end he forced the resignation of the director of the Central Bank, ƒ∞smail Aydƒ±noƒülu, who opposed it. The strategic aim was to unite Turkey with the \\"global economy,\\" which big business supported, and gave Turkish companies the ability to market products and services globally. One month after the coup, London's International Banking Review wrote \\"A feeling of hope is evident among international bankers that Turkey's military coup may have opened the way to greater political stability as an essential prerequisite for the revitalization of the Turkish economy\\". During 1980‚Äì1983, the foreign exchange rate was allowed to float freely. Foreign investment was encouraged. The national establishments, initiated by Atat√ºrk's Reforms, were promoted to involve joint enterprises with foreign establishments. The 85% pre-coup level government involvement in the economy forced a reduction in the relative importance of the state sector. Just after the coup, Turkey revitalized the Atat√ºrk Dam and the Southeastern Anatolia Project, which was a land reform project promoted as a solution to the underdeveloped Southeastern Anatolia. It was transformed into a multi- sector social and economic development program, a sustainable development program, for the 9 million people of the region. The closed economy, produced for only Turkey's need, was subsidized for a vigorous export drive. The drastic expansion of the economy during this period was relative to the previous level. The GDP remained well below those of most Middle Eastern and European countries. The government froze wages while the economy experienced a significant decrease of the public sector, a deflationist policy, and several successive mini-devaluations. =Tribunals= The coup rounded up members of both the left and right for trial with military tribunals. Within a very short time, there were 250,000 to 650,000 people detained. Among the detainees, 230,000 were tried, 14,000 were stripped of citizenship, and 50 were executed. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people were tortured, and thousands disappeared. A total of 1,683,000 people were blacklisted. Apart from the militants killed during shootings, at least four prisoners were legally executed immediately after the coup; the first ones since 1972, while in February 1982 there were 108 prisoners condemned to capital punishment. Among the prosecuted were Ecevit, Demirel, T√ºrke≈ü, and Erbakan, who were incarcerated and temporarily suspended from politics. One notable victim of the hangings was a 17-year-old Erdal Eren, who said he looked forward to it in order to avoid thinking of the torture he had witnessed. After having taken advantage of the Grey Wolves' activism, General Kenan Evren imprisoned hundreds of them. At the time they were some 1700 Grey Wolves organizations in Turkey, with about 200,000 registered members and a million sympathizers. In its indictment of the MHP in May 1981, the Turkish military government charged 220 members of the MHP and its affiliates for 694 murders.Searchlight, No.47 (May 1979), pg. 6. Quoted by Evren and his cohorts realized that T√ºrke≈ü was a charismatic leader who could challenge their authority using the paramilitary Grey Wolves. Following the coup in Colonel T√ºrke≈ü's indictment, the Turkish press revealed the close links maintained by the MHP with security forces as well as organized crime involved in drug trade, which financed in return weapons and the activities of hired fascist commandos all over the country. =Constitution= Within three years the generals passed some 800 laws in order to form a militarily disciplined society.History of the Kurdish Uprising a paper of the International Council on Human Rights Policy . Retrieved 31 October 2009. The coup members were convinced of the unworkability of the existing constitution. They decided to adopt a new constitution that included mechanisms to prevent what they saw as impeding the functioning of democracy. On 29 June 1981 the military junta appointed 160 people as members of an advisory assembly to draft a new constitution. The new constitution brought clear limits and definitions, such as on the rules of election of the president, which was stated as a factor for the coup d'√©tat. On 7 November 1982 the new constitution was put to a referendum, which was accepted with 92% of the vote. On 9 November 1982 Kenan Evren was appointed President for the next seven years.

This democratization has been criticized by the Turkish scholar Ergun √ñzbudun as a \\"textbook case\\" of a junta's dictating the terms of its departure.√ñzbudun, Ergun. Contemporary Turkish Politics: Challenges to Democratic Consolidation, Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2000, pg. 117. \\"The 1983 Turkish transition is almost a textbook example of the degree to which a departing military regime can dictate the conditions of its departure (...).\\" The referendum and the elections did not take place in a free and competitive setting. Many political leaders of pre- coup era (including S√ºleyman Demirel, B√ºlent Ecevit, Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü and Necmettin Erbakan) had been banned from politics, and all new parties needed to get the approval of the National Security Council in order to participate in the elections. Only three parties, two of which were actually created by the junta, were permitted to contest. The secretary general of the National Security Council was general Haydar Saltƒ±k. Both he and Evren were the strong men of the regime, while the government was headed by a retired admiral, B√ºlend Ulusu, and included several retired military officers and a few civil servants. Some alleged in Turkey, after the coup, that General Saltuk had been preparing a more radical, rightist coup, which had been one of the reasons prompting the other generals to act, respecting the hierarchy, and then to include him in the MGK in order to neutralize him. Out of the 1983 elections came one-party governance under Turgut √ñzal's Motherland Party, which combined a neoliberal economic program with conservative social values. Yildirim Akbulut became the head of the Parliament. He was succeeded in 1991 by Mesut Yƒ±lmaz. Meanwhile, S√ºleyman Demirel founded the center-right True Path Party in 1983, and returned to active politics after the 1987 Turkish referendum. Yƒ±lmaz redoubled Turkey's economic profile, converting towns like Gaziantep from small provincial capitals into mid-sized economic boomtowns, and renewed its orientation toward Europe. But political instability followed as the host of banned politicians reentered politics, fracturing the vote, and the Motherland Party became increasingly corrupt. Ozal, who succeeded Evren as President of Turkey, died of a heart attack in 1993, and S√ºleyman Demirel was elected president. The √ñzal government empowered the police force with intelligence capabilities to counter the National Intelligence Organization, which at the time was run by the military. The police force even engaged in external intelligence collection. =Trial of coup leaders= After the 2010 referendum, an investigation was started regarding the coup, and in June 2011, the Specially Authorized Ankara Deputy Prosecutor's Office asked ex-prosecutor Sacit Kayasu to forward a copy of an indictment he had prepared for Kenan Evren. Kayasu had previously been fired for trying to indict Evren in 2003. In January 2012, a Turkish court accepted the indictments against General Kenan Evren and General Tahsin ≈ûahinkaya, the only coup leaders still alive at the time, for their role in the coup. Prosecutors sought life sentences against the two retired generals.BBC News Turkish ex-president Kenan Evren faces coup charge, 10 January 2012 According to the indictment, a total of 191 people died in custody during the aftermath of the coup, due to \\"inhumane\\" acts.Today's Zaman Fears of suicide prompt Evren family to remove coup leader's firearms , 19 January 2012 The trial began on 4 April 2012.Why does Evren still think so? , 22 March 2012 In 2012, a court case was launched against ≈ûahinkaya and Kenan Evren relating to the 1980 military coup. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 June 2014 by a court in Ankara. But neither of the two was sent to prison as both were in hospitals for medical treatment. ≈ûahinkaya died in the G√ºlhane Military Medical Academy Hospital (GATA) in Haydarpa≈üa, Istanbul on 9 July 2015. Evren died at a military hospital in Ankara on 9 May 2015, aged 97. His sentence was on appeal at the time of his death. Allegations of the US involvement The American involvement in this coup was alleged to have been acknowledged by the CIA Ankara station chief Paul Henze. In his book \\"12 Eyl√ºl: saat 04.00\\" Journalist Mehmet Ali Birand wrote that after the government was overthrown, Henze cabled Washington, saying, \\"our boys did it.\\" On June 2003 interview to Zaman Henze denied American involvement stating \\"I did not say to Carter \\"Our boys did it.\\" It is totally a tale, a myth, It is something Birand fabricated.

One standard way of defining epistemic certainty is that a belief is certain if and only if the person holding that belief could not be mistaken in holding that belief. Other common definitions of certainty involve the indubitable nature of such beliefs or define certainty as a property of those beliefs with the greatest possible justification. Certainty is closely related to knowledge, although contemporary philosophers tend to treat knowledge as having lower requirements than certainty. Importantly, epistemic certainty is not the same thing as psychological certainty (also known as subjective certainty), which describes the highest degree to which a person could be convinced that something is true. While a person may be completely convinced that a particular belief is true, and might even be psychologically incapable of entertaining its falsity, this does not entail that the belief is itself beyond rational doubt or incapable of being false.Baron Reed, \\"Certainty\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) While the word \\"certainty\\" is sometimes used to refer to a person's subjective certainty about the truth of a belief, philosophers are primarily interested in the question of whether any beliefs ever attain objective certainty. The philosophical question of whether one can ever be truly certain about anything has been widely debated for centuries. Many proponents of philosophical skepticism deny that certainty is possible, or claim that it is only possible in a priori domains such as logic or mathematics. Historically, many philosophers have held that knowledge requires epistemic certainty, and therefore that one must have infallible justification in order to count as knowing the truth of a proposition. However, many philosophers such as Ren√© Descartes were troubled by the resulting skeptical implications, since all of our experiences at least seem to be compatible with various skeptical scenarios. It is generally accepted today that most of our beliefs are compatible with their falsity and are therefore fallible, although the status of being certain is still often ascribed to a limited range of beliefs (such as \\"I exist\\"). The apparent fallibility of our beliefs has led many contemporary philosophers to deny that knowledge requires certainty. Nothing can be known for perfect certain; always a particle of doubt can remain. This is known as acatalepsy. History =Ancient Greece= Major elements of philosophical skepticism‚Äîthe idea that things cannot be known with certainty, which the ancient Greeks expressed by the word acatalepsia‚Äîare apparent in the writings of several ancient Greek philosophers, particularly Xenophanes and Democritus. The first Hellenistic school that embraced philosophical skepticism was Pyrrhonism, which was founded by Pyrrho of Elis. Pyrrho's skepticism quickly spread to Plato's Academy under Arcesilaus, who abandoned Platonic dogma and initiated Academic Skepticism, the second skeptical school of Hellenistic philosophy. The major difference between the two skeptical schools was that Pyrrhonism's aims were psychotherapeutic (i.e., to lead practitioners to the state of ataraxia - freedom from anxiety, whereas those of Academic Skepticism were about making judgments under uncertainty (i.e., to identify what arguments were most truth-like). =Descartes ‚Äì 17th century= In his Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes first discards all belief in things which are not absolutely certain, and then tries to establish what can be known for sure. Although the phrase \\"Cogito, ergo sum\\" is often attributed to Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy, it is actually put forward in his Discourse on Method. Due to the implications of inferring the conclusion within the predicate, however, he changed the argument to \\"I think, I exist\\"; this then became his first certainty. Descartes' conclusion being that, in order to doubt, that which is doing the doubting certainly has to exist - the act of doubting thus proving the existence of the doubter. =Ludwig Wittgenstein ‚Äì 20th century= On Certainty is a series of notes made by Ludwig Wittgenstein just prior to his death. The main theme of the work is that context plays a role in epistemology. Wittgenstein asserts an anti- foundationalist message throughout the work: that every claim can be doubted but certainty is possible in a framework. \\"The function [propositions] serve in language is to serve as a kind of framework within which empirical propositions can make sense\\". Degrees of certainty Physicist Lawrence M. Krauss suggests that the need for identifying degrees of certainty is under- appreciated in various domains, including policy-making and the understanding of science. This is because different goals require different degrees of certainty‚Äîand politicians are not always aware of (or do not make it clear) how much certainty we are working with. Rudolf Carnap viewed certainty as a matter of degree (\\"degrees of certainty\\") which could be objectively measured, with degree one being certainty. Bayesian analysis derives degrees of certainty which are interpreted as a measure of subjective psychological belief. Alternatively, one might use the legal degrees of certainty. These standards of evidence ascend as follows: no credible evidence, some credible evidence, a preponderance of evidence, clear and convincing evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, and beyond any shadow of a doubt (i.e. undoubtable‚Äîrecognized as an impossible standard to meet‚Äîwhich serves only to terminate the list). If knowledge requires absolute certainty, then knowledge is most likely impossible, as evidenced by the apparent fallibility of our beliefs. Foundational crisis of mathematics The foundational crisis of mathematics was the early 20th century's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics. After several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century, the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be stated within mathematics itself began to be heavily challenged. One attempt after another to provide unassailable foundations for mathematics was found to suffer from various paradoxes (such as Russell's paradox) and to be inconsistent. Various schools of thought were opposing each other. The leading school was that of the formalist approach, of which David Hilbert was the foremost proponent, culminating in what is known as Hilbert's program, which sought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a formal system proved sound by metamathematical finitistic means. The main opponent was the intuitionist school, led by L.E.J. Brouwer, which resolutely discarded formalism as a meaningless game with symbols. The fight was acrimonious. In 1920 Hilbert succeeded in having Brouwer, whom he considered a threat to mathematics, removed from the editorial board of Mathematische Annalen, the leading mathematical journal of the time. G√∂del's incompleteness theorems, proved in 1931, showed that essential aspects of Hilbert's program could not be attained. In G√∂del's first result he showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent finitely axiomatizable system‚Äîsuch as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetic‚Äîa statement that can be shown to be true, but that does not follow from the rules of the system. It thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in Hilbert's program. In a next result G√∂del showed that such a system was not powerful enough for proving its own consistency, let alone that a simpler system could do the job. This proves that there is no hope to prove the consistency of any system that contains an axiomatization of elementary arithmetic, and, in particular, to prove the consistency of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory (ZFC), the system which is generally used for building all mathematics. However, if ZFC would not be consistent, there would exist a proof of both a theorem and its negation, and this would imply a proof of all theorems and all their negations. As, despite the large number of mathematical areas that have been deeply studied, no such contradiction has ever been found, this provides an almost certainty of mathematical results. Moreover, if such a contradiction would eventually be found, most mathematicians are convinced that it will be possible to resolve it by a slight modification of the axioms of ZFC. Moreover, the method of forcing allows proving the consistency of a theory, provided that another theory is consistent. For example, if ZFC is consistent, adding to it the continuum hypothesis or a negation of it defines two theories that are both consistent (in other words, the continuum is independent from the axioms of ZFC). This existence of proofs of relative consistency implies that the consistency of modern mathematics depends weakly on a particular choice on the axioms on which mathematics are built. In this sense, the crisis has been resolved, as, although consistency of ZFC is not provable, it solves (or avoids) all logical paradoxes at the origin of the crisis, and there are many facts that provide a quasi-certainty of the consistency of modern mathematics.

See in Oxford Living Dictionaries. The Jacobean era succeeds the Elizabethan era and precedes the Caroline era. The term \\"Jacobean\\" is often used for the distinctive styles of Jacobean architecture, visual arts, decorative arts, and literature which characterized that period. James as King of England The practical if not formal unification of England and Scotland under one ruler was an important shift of order for both nations, and would shape their existence to the present day. Another development of crucial significance was the foundation of the first British colonies on the North American continent, at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, in Newfoundland in 1610, and at Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1620, which laid the foundation for future British settlement and the eventual formation of both Canada and the United States of America. In 1609 the Parliament of Scotland began the Plantation of Ulster. A notable event of James' reign occurred on 5 November 1605. On that date, a group of English Catholics (including Guy Fawkes) attempted to assassinate the King and destroy Parliament in the Palace of Westminster. However, the Gunpowder Plot was exposed and prevented, and the convicted plotters were hanged, drawn, and quartered. Historians have long debated the curious characteristics of the king's ruling style. Croft says: :The pragmatism of 'little by little' was coming to characterise his style of governance. At the same time, the curious combination of ability and complacency, idleness and shrewd judgement, warm emotions and lack of discretion so well described by Fontenay remained typical of James throughout his life.Pauline Croft, King James (2003) p. 20. =Royal finances= Political events and developments of the Jacobean era cannot be understood separately from the economic and financial situation. James was deeply in debt in Scotland,Julian Goodare, \\"The debts of James VI of Scotland.\\" Economic History Review 62.4 (2009): 926‚Äì952. and after 1603 he inherited an English debt of ¬£350,000 from Elizabeth. By 1608 the English debt had risen to ¬£1,400,000 and was increasing by ¬£140,000 annually. Through a crash program of selling off Royal demesnes, Lord Treasurer Robert Cecil reduced the debt to ¬£300,000 and the annual deficit to ¬£46,000 by 1610‚Äîbut could not follow the same method of relief much farther. The result was a series of tense and often failed negotiations with Parliament for financial supports, a situation that deteriorated over the reigns of James and his son and heir Charles I until the crisis of the English Civil War.Melissa D. Aaron, Global Economics, Newark, DE, University of Delaware Press, 2020; pp. 83‚Äì4. The Jacobean era ended with a severe economic depression in 1620‚Äì1626, complicated by a serious outbreak of bubonic plague in London in 1625. =Foreign-policy= King James I was sincerely devoted to peace, not just for his three kingdoms but for Europe as a whole. He called himself \\"Rex Pacificus\\" (\\"King of peace.\\")Malcolm Smuts, \\"The making of Rex Pacificus: James VI and I and the Problem of Peace in an Age of Religious War,\\" in Daniel Fischlin and Mark Fortier, eds., Royal Subjects: Essays on the Writings of James VI and I (2002) pp 371‚Äì87 He disliked Puritans and Jesuits alike because of their eagerness for warfare. Europe was deeply polarized, and on the verge of the massive Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), with the smaller established Protestant states facing the aggression of the larger Catholic empires. On assuming the throne, James made peace with Catholic Spain, and made it his policy to marry his daughter to the Spanish prince. The marriage of James' daughter Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine on 14 February 1613 was more than the social event of the era; the couple's union had important political and military implications. Across Europe, the German princes were banding together in the Union of German Protestant Princes, headquartered in Heidelberg, the capital of the Palatine. King James calculated that his daughter's marriage would give him diplomatic leverage among the Protestants.W. B. Patterson, \\"King James I and the Protestant cause in the crisis of 1618‚Äì22.\\" Studies in Church History 18 (1982): 319‚Äì334. He thus would have a foot in both camps and be able to broker peaceful settlements. In his na√Øvet√©, he did not realize that both sides were playing him as a tool for their own goal of achieving destruction of the other side. The Catholics in Spain, as well as the Emperor Ferdinand II, the Vienna-based leader of the Habsburgs who controlled the Holy Roman Empire were both heavily influenced by the Catholic counter-Reformation. They had the goal of expelling Protestantism from their domains. Lord Buckingham, who increasingly was the actual ruler of Britain, wanted an alliance with Spain. Buckingham took Charles with him to Spain to woo the Princess. However, Spain's terms were that James must drop Britain‚Äôs anti-Catholic intolerance or no marriage. Buckingham and Charles were humiliated and Buckingham became the leader of the widespread British demand for a war against Spain. Meanwhile, the Protestant princes looked to Britain, since it was the strongest of all the Protestant countries, to give military support for their cause. His son-in-law and daughter became king and queen of Bohemia, which outraged Vienna. The Thirty Years' War began, as the Habsburg Emperor ousted the new king and queen of Bohemia, and massacred their followers. Catholic Bavaria then invaded the Palatine, and James‚Äôs son-in-law begged for James‚Äôs military intervention. James finally realized his policies had backfired and refused these pleas. He successfully kept Britain out of the European-wide war that proved so heavily devastating for three decades. James's backup plan was to marry his son Charles to a French Catholic princess, who would bring a handsome dowry. Parliament and the British people were strongly opposed to any Catholic marriage, were demanding immediate war with Spain, and strongly favored with the Protestant cause in Europe. James had alienated both elite and popular opinion in Britain, and Parliament was cutting back its financing. Historians credit James for pulling back from a major war at the last minute, and keeping Britain in peace.Jonathan Scott, England's Troubles: 17th-century English Political Instability in European Context (Cambridge UP, 2000), pp 98‚Äì101Godfrey Davies, The Early Stuarts: 1603‚Äì1660 (1959), pp 47‚Äì67 Frederick and Elizabeth's election as King and Queen of Bohemia in 1619, and the conflict that resulted, marked the beginning of the disastrous Thirty Years' War. King James' determination to avoid involvement in the continental conflict, even during the \\"war fever\\" of 1623, appears in retrospect as one of the most significant, and most positive, aspects of his reign.G.M.D. Howat, Stuart and Cromwellian Foreign Policy (1974) pp 17‚Äì42. High culture =Literature= In literature, some of Shakespeare's most prominent plays, including King Lear (1605), Macbeth (1606), and The Tempest (1610), were written during the reign of James I. Patronage came not just from James, but from James' wife Anne of Denmark. Also during this period were powerful works by John Webster, Thomas Middleton, John Ford and Ben Jonson. Ben Jonson also contributed to some of the era's best poetry, together with the Cavalier poets and John Donne. In prose, the most representative works are found in those of Francis Bacon and the King James Bible. In 1617 George Chapman completed his monumental translation of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey into English verse, which were the first ever complete translations of either poem, both central to the Western Canon, into the English language. The wildly popular tale of the Trojan War had until then been available to readers of English only in medieval epic retellings such as Caxton's Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye. Jonson was also an important innovator in the specialised literary subgenre of the masque, which went through an intense development in the Jacobean era. His name is linked with that of Inigo Jones as co-developers of the literary and visual/technical aspects of this hybrid art. (For Jonson's masques, see: The Masque of Blackness, The Masque of Queens, etc.) The high costs of these spectacles, however, positioned the Stuarts far from the relative frugality of Elizabeth's reign, and alienated the middle classes and the Puritans with a prospect of waste and self-indulgent excess. =Science= Francis Bacon had a strong influence in the evolution of modern science, which was entering a key phase in this era, as the work of Johannes Kepler in Germany and Galileo Galilei in Italy brought the Copernican revolution to a new level of development. Bacon laid a foundation, and was a powerful and persuasive advocate, for objective inquiry about the natural world in place of the Medieval scholastic authoritarianism that still influenced the culture of British society in his lifetime. On practical rather than general levels, much work was being done in the areas of navigation, cartography, and surveying‚ÄîJohn Widdowes' A Description of the World (1621) being one significant volume in this area‚Äîas well as in continuing William Gilbert's work on magnetism from the previous reign. Scholarship and the sciences, or \\"natural philosophy\\", had important royal patrons in this era‚Äînot so much in the King but in his son, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and even his wife, Anne of Denmark (the Danish Court, from which she derived, had a strong patronage tradition in intellectual matters). =Arts and architecture= The fine arts were dominated by foreign talent in the Jacobean era, as was true of the Tudor and Stuart periods in general. Daniel Mytens was the most prominent portrait painter during the reign of James, as Anthony van Dyck would be under the coming reign of his son. Yet the slow development of a native school of painting, which had made progress in the previous reign, continued under James, producing figures like Robert Peake the Elder (died 1619), William Larkin (fl. 1609‚Äì19), and Sir Nathaniel Bacon (1585‚Äì1627). Some would also claim, as part of this trend, Cornelius Johnson, or Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen (1593‚Äì1661), born and trained in London and active through the first two Stuart reigns.Eliis Waterhouse, Painting in Britain 1530 to 1790', fourth edition, New York, Viking Penguin, 1978; pp. 42‚Äì66. The decorative arts ‚Äì furniture, for example ‚Äì became increasingly rich in color, detail, and design. Materials from other parts of the world, like mother-of-pearl, were now available by worldwide trade and were used as decoration. Even familiar materials, such as wood and silver, were worked more deeply in intricate and intensely three-dimensional designs. Architecture in the Jacobean era was a continuation of the Elizabethan style with increasing emphasis on classical elements like columns. European influences include France, Flanders, and Italy. Inigo Jones may be the most famous English architect of this period, with lasting contributions to classical public building style; some of his works include the Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall. St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral designed by Sir Christopher Wren in London. See also: Jacobean architecture.

James I published his A Counterblaste to Tobacco in 1604, but the book had no discernible effect; by 1612, London had 7,000 tobacconists and smoking houses. The Virginia colony survived because the English acquired the nicotine habit.

It is situated south of Chiemsee and southwest of Ruhpolding - home of the Biathlon World Cup - in the Bavarian Alps and facing towards Tyrol. The village lies next to the Austrian states Tyrol and Salzburg. K√∂ssen in Tyrol is the next village on the river Lofer, before it joins the confluence of the river Tiroler Achen. Reit im Winkl has a population of approximately 2,600. Reit im Winkl is well known as both a certified place of restorative and curative air (Luftkurort) and a ski resort, offering alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, both classical and skating, and snow-boarding, as well as mountain trekking and hiking. It achieved, in 2012, Germany's first-ever Premium Winter Trails Certification.http://www.reitimwinkl.de/winterwandern-premium-winterwanderwege Snowfall is always plentiful and predictable (even when surrounding areas are bare of snow, Reit im Winkl can be sure of sufficient snow to create premier skiing conditions - in 2012 Reit im Winkl had the deepest snow of 120 cm for a plateau area,http://www.wetterdienst.de/Deutschlandwetter/Thema_des_Tages/850/deutschlandwetter- im-jahr-2012 which occurred in February, long after snow had melted elsewhere in the region. Reit im Winkl has two alpine skiing areas: 1) Three lifts in the suburb of Blindau (Benzeck) as well as a snow-tubing lift, and the large plateau skiing area at Winklmoos Alm www.winklmoosalm.de which connects with Steinplatte in Austria and is reached by the recently completed, state-of-the- art gondola cableway (bubble lift) from Seegatterl. In summer, Reit im Winkl enjoys one of the highest counts of sunny days in Bavaria, and is popular with mountain bike and nordic walking enthusiasts. Visitors can enjoy swimming in either of the three alpine lakes (Weitsee, Mittersee and Loedensee) northeast of Seegatterl, or try their luck at fishing in the trout lake. Reit im Winkl is popularly known to locals and return visitors as Germany's own Tyrol, and boasts its own home-grown regional specialities such as Heumilch cheese (cheese made from cows fed exclusively hay pasture), heuschnapps (a liqueur in which mountain hay and herbs are soaked to produce a distinctive and sweet taste of hay) and Reiberdatschi (grated potatoes mixed with a little egg and flour and poured as a flat mass into a skillet and fried), popularly eaten with apple mousse. Suburbs Reit im Winkl is divided into the suburbs Birnbach, Blindau, Entfelden, Groissenbach, Oberbichl, Seegatterl, Unterbichl and Winklmoos Alm. History The first signs of settlement in Reit im Winkl are in the 12th century. The date of the foundation is 1160 when Otto de Rute was named in a document. The accuracy of the document is disputed and some historians put the beginning of the settlement to the middle of the 13th century. Since then it has been part of Bavaria. Reit im Winkl was part of the parish of Kirchdorf in Tirol which was itself part of the diocese of Chiemsee from 1275 until 1804. Historians have assumed the location of the manor of the Herren von Reit (Lords of Reit), on a small hill above the church. Coat of arms The coat of arms was created 1929 replacing the old coat of arms which showed a blue chapel on a green hill. The new coat of arms shows the eagle on yellow ground of the diocese of Chiemsee in a corner (Winkl derived from the German word Winkel for corner). The burning log and the sapie (axe like tool to trail logs) on the forest green ground are symbols for the clearing of the forest to create pasture and farm land in 11th and 12th century. Economy =History= Formerly, Reit im Winkl was mostly dependent on logging and forestry, because of the brevity of the growing season for agricultural production. Trees were logged in summer and transported to storage places with horses or by hand. Logs were transferred to neighbouring Tyrol for sale: in winter either via sleds with a man sitting in front using his feet to brake and control the sled, which resulted in severe accidents occurring regularly, or via dams which were constructed to hold the meltwater during spring in order to raft the timber down the valley - such a dam can be found on display at Winklmoss Alm. Because the orientation of the valley made it impossible to sell the rafted wood to the salt works of Bad Reichenhall or Traunstein - which had an enormous fuel consumption - logs were sent south. In one such contract the wood was sold to the silver works in the Inn valley in Tyrol and as an exchange Tyrol sold logs to the salt works in Bad Reichenhall. =Today= The first tourist to Reit im Winkl, in the year 1858, was King Maximilian II, as reported in the local press. The Strength Through Joy movement in the Third Reich and the closed borders after the war boosted tourism as the principal source of income in the region. Today, approximately 5000 beds for annual visitor numbers of 90 000 provides an indication of the importance of tourism for Reit im Winkl. Transport 280x280px Reit im Winkl is located along the Deutschen Alpenstra√üe (B 305) (German Alps Road). Coming from Munich by car it can be reached either from the Munich-Salzburg highway A8 at Bernau or Chiemsee and the Tiroler Achen valley; coming from Salzburg along the Munich-Salzburg A8 at Siegsdorf or Grabenstatt via Ruhpolding, or through Bad Reichenhall via Berchtesgarden. The Maserer pass (B305, direction Marquartstein) has been renovated and widened (most recently at the end of the 20th century) - during periods of heavy snowfall, snow chains are recommended. The B305 continues through the village, across the border into Austria and follows the river Lofer river to K√∂ssen straight into the Inn valley. Because of the need for transport capacities for the sawmills and logs from the surrounding forest a narrow gauge railway was built from Ruhpolding to Reit im Winkl in 1923. Following accidents and as a result of the high maintenance costs (winter conditions) the railway was demolished in the 1930s. The causeway is used as a bicycle trail in summer and for nordic skiing in the winter. Apart from private car, Reit im Winkl can be reached via public transport - the RVO (Regionalverkehr Oberbayern) runs the following bus services which also connect (in the case of Prien am Chiemsee, Salzburg and Traunstein) with the Deutsche Bahn (train services). 1\\\\. 9505 - Reit im Winkl - Prien am Chiemsee 2\\\\. 9506 - Reit im Winkl - Inzell 3\\\\. 9507 - Reit im Winkl - Winklmoos 4\\\\. 9509 - Reit im Winkl - Traunstein 5\\\\. 9531 - Oberw√∂ssen - √úbersee 6\\\\. 9535 - Reit im Winkl - Salzburg Reit im Winkl also has one taxi service, a rental car service, and a minibus rental/coach with driver service.

Melbourne : Commonwealth Railways. internal map titled Map shewing Connections between Capital Cities via Trans- Australian Railway History Cook was created in 1917 when the railway was built and is named after the sixth Prime Minister of Australia, Joseph Cook. The town depended on the Tea and Sugar Train for the delivery of supplies, and is on the longest stretch of straight railway in the world, at which stretches from Ooldea to beyond Loongana. When the town was active, water was pumped from an underground Artesian aquifer but now, all water is carried in by train. The 1964 black- and-white film Nullabor Hideout was set in and around Cook. Today In 2009, it was said to have a resident population of four, and is essentially a ghost town. The town was effectively closed in 1997 when the railways were privatised and the new owners did not need a support town there, although the diesel refuelling facilities remain, and there is overnight accommodation for train drivers. Cook is the only scheduled stop on the Nullarbor Plain for the Indian Pacific passenger train across Australia and has little other than curiosity value for the passengers. The bush hospital is closed, but the town maintains some medical supplies in the event of a train disaster. The hospital advertised itself at the station with the catch cry \\"If you're crook come to Cook\\". The shop is only opened while the Indian Pacific is in town. It has a few houses and fuel tanks for the locomotives. The crossing loop can cross trains up to long. The former airstrip is known as a place to spot inland dotterel. An interview with a resident revealed that they use both the Western Australian and South Australian time zones, for people from both states, so they do not have to adjust their watches. When the railway was sold, eight transportable houses were taken away and made into holiday houses on the coast.

Vescelius. (2004) Languages of the Pre-Columbian Antilles. The University of Alabama Press. p. 83 Between the years of 1500 and 1825, many documented treasure laden ships were destroyed on Inaguan reefs. The two most valuable wrecks lost off the Inaguas were treasure-laden Spanish galleons: the Santa Rosa in 1599; and the Infanta in 1788. Other ships of considerable value that were wrecked there include the French Le Count De Paix in 1713, citing \\"America and West Indies: July 1716,\\" Calendar of State Papers; \\"Journal, July 1716: Journal Book S,\\" Journals of the Board of Trade and Plantations, Volme 3; March 1715 - October 1718 (1924), pp. 159-173 the British HMS Lowestoffe in 1801, and the British HMS Statira in 1815.The Statira Shoal, just southeast of Great Inagua, is named after it and is where the ship wrecked. As early as the 1600s, salt was being produced and shipped to Spanish colonies, and its extraction was a going business by 1803. Henri Christophe, king of northern Haiti from 1811 to 1820, built a summer retreat at the Northeast Point of Great Inagua. Local legend has it that he also buried a cache of gold there., reprinted in 1984 in London by Robert Hale Ltd. By 1918, after the end of World War I, lower salt prices and competition had driven the small producers on Great Inagua out of business, and the salt works were abandoned except for incidental local use. In 1935, the Erickson brothers from Massachusetts founded West India Chemicals Ltd., purchasing the abandoned salt works from the British government. They drilled test holes, set up offices, and began restoration of the buildings, but the localsNotably George and Willis Duvalier who were sentenced to hang as a result of the riot. felt threatened, fearing changes to the power structure status quo. In August 1937, a riot broke out, an employee was killed, and the Ericksons were forced to flee. They soon returned, and full-scale development resumed. In the mid-1950s, Morton Salt bought the Great Inagua saltworks, which includes over 80 salt ponds, now the second largest such operation in North America. Morton is the major employer on the island.In 2008 Morton employed about 60% of the island's working population. Morton Salt‚Äôs Inagua facility damaged by Irma.

Islands =Great Inagua= Great Inagua is the second largest island in the Bahamas at 596 sq mi (1544 km2) and lies about from the eastern tip of Cuba. The island is about in extent and mostly flat with some sand hills, the highest points being East Hill at , Salt Pond Hill at , and James Hill at . It encloses several lakes, most notably the long Lake Windsor (also called Lake Rosa) which occupies nearly a quarter of the interior. The population of Great Inagua is 913 (2010 census). The island's capital and only harbour is Matthew Town, named after George Matthew, a 19th-century Governor of the Bahamas. This town houses the Morton Salt Company‚Äôs main facility, producing one million tonnes of sea salt a year ‚Äî the second largest solar saline operation in North America and Inagua's main industry. Great Inagua Airport (IATA: IGA, ICAO: MYIG) is located nearby. A large bird sanctuary in the centre of the island has a population of more than 80,000 West Indian flamingoes and many other bird species, including the Bahama parrot, Inagua woodstar, Bahama pintail, brown pelican, tricolored heron, snowy egret, reddish egret, stripe-headed tanager, double-crested cormorant, Neotropic cormorant, roseate spoonbill, American kestrel, and burrowing owl. The Union Creek National Reserve is specially set aside for the study of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas). =Little Inagua= The neighbouring Little Inagua, to the northeast, is uninhabited and occupied by a large Land and Sea Park. It has an area of , with herds of feral donkeys and goats (descendants of stock introduced by the French). Various species of endangered sea turtles breed on the island. Little Inagua has a large protective reef extending up to away from the island in all directions, which prevents boats from coming too close.

Eight years later he married Jane \\"Minnie\\" Jones. In 1900 he survived a shipwreck on the Newfoundland coast when he was an officer on the SS Lusitania (not the later Cunarder torpedoed in the First World War). Two years later he worked with Guglielmo Marconi to develop ship-to-shore radio before getting his first command in 1908. Two years after that he was appointed captain of the Canadian Pacific Line's , and within months had become famous following his role in the capture of Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen, the London cellar murderer, in what was the first use of radio to capture a criminal. Kendall's radio messages alerted Scotland Yard, and Inspector Walter Dew was dispatched to Canada on the faster ship, the White Star Line's , and arrived in Canada before Montrose. Disguised as a pilot, Dew boarded Montrose and arrested Crippen. =Shipwreck of RMS Empress of Ireland= In May 1914 Kendall was appointed captain of the . Almost a month later the ship sank in Canada's Saint Lawrence River after colliding with the , a Norwegian coal freighter with an ice-breaking bow. The accident occurred at night. The two ships were head to head when a fog bank rolled onto the river and Storstad changed position, believing Empress of Ireland to be on Storstads port side. This turned the freighter into the side of the larger ship, which was passing on the starboard side. The damage was catastrophic and Empress of Ireland sank in just 14 minutes with the loss of 1,012 people. Kendall was thrown from the bridge when the ship keeled over suddenly but survived; he was cleared of all charges in the disaster. =Action in the First World War= Soon afterwards he was posted to Antwerp, Belgium, where he was soon in the news again. As the Germans invaded Belgium, the British Consulate in Antwerp was besieged by around 600 refugees. Kendall worked with the consul Sir Cecil Hertslet to formulate a plan to rescue them by using the to tow the , which was out of commission, out of the port and on to England. Kendall then joined the crew of and served with the ship until 1918, during which time he was mentioned in despatches on several occasions. In March 1918 Calgarian was torpedoed off the Ulster coast by German submarine but Kendall survived again. He went on to serve as a King's Messenger before being appointed Commodore of Convoys. When the war ended he was appointed Marine Superintendent at Southampton by Canadian Pacific and remained there until he moved to a similar position in London in 1924. Death He died in an English nursing home in 1965 at the age of 91. His obituary in The Times made no mention of the sinking of the Empress of Ireland.

It consisted of three episodes with ten levels in each episode, with the first episode being released as shareware. The full release came on two 3¬Ω\\" floppy disks and was accompanied by a guide to the game's thirty levels. According to David P. Gray himself, the game is the first pixelated Windows game to use the WinG interface. The graphics were similar to those used in Wolfenstein 3D or Ken's Labyrinth, with perpendicular walls and no textures on the floors or ceilings. The music in Nitemare 3D was composed by David B. Schultz (also composed for Quiver). Plot Nitemare 3D follows the story of Hugo, from the Hugo trilogy, a series of graphic adventure PC games consisting of Hugo's House of Horrors, Hugo II, Whodunit?, and Hugo III, Jungle of Doom!. Penelope, Hugo's girlfriend, has been kidnapped by the evil Dr. Hammerstein for use in heinous experiments. Hugo must battle through Hammerstein's bizarre mansion, caverns complete with prisons and laboratories, and finally through a twisted alternate dimension of demons and aliens in an attempt to save her. Gameplay Rather than the fast-paced action of Wolfenstein 3D, Nitemare 3D has a slightly slower, more puzzle-oriented style of gameplay. The four weapons (plasma gun, magic wand, pistol, and auto-repeat plasma gun) have different usages‚Äîfor example, magic blasts are especially useful against magical creatures such as witches, whereas robots are practically immune to them. Meanwhile, vampires take heavy damage from silver bullets, while shrugging off the effects of the plasma gun. Each level in the game has numerous secret panels, some of which were purely for bonuses, but others are essential to completing the level. To make this task easier, the player can collect magic eyes, which enable the player to activate a mini-map in the game's HUD and give hints as to the locations of panels, and crystal balls for displaying the location of enemies. In a similar vein to id Software's Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, the player character's face is shown on the status bar and acts as a visual reflection of the player's health, although instead of becoming bloodier, the skin wears away, leaving a skull when near death, and a darkened skull when dead - alike to the early Catacomb 3-D game.

Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England, p. 184, New York Burt Franklin, 1963. It first appears in Europe around 1160 in \\"aristocratic\\" French. Roughly between the period 1200 and 1350 it was one of the most popular of all the romantic plots. The story of Floris and Blancheflour The following synopsis is from the original Old French \\"aristocratic\\" version (Floire et Blancheflor) of the late 12th century. The Middle English version of the poem derives from an Old French \\"aristocratic\\" version but differs somewhat in details. The opening section concerning how the two are born is missing from the English versions. Originally it dates to around 1250 and was called Floris and Blanchefleur. =Old French version= Felix, King of Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain), on one of his ventures into Galicia in northwestern Spain attacks a band of Christian pilgrims en route on the Way of St James to the famous medieval pilgrimage shrine of Santiago de Compostela. Among the pilgrims are a French knight and his recently widowed daughter, who has chosen to dedicate the rest of her life to the sanctuary. The knight is killed, and his daughter is taken prisoner to Naples, where she is made lady-in-waiting to Felix's wife. Both women are pregnant, and the children are born on the same day, Palm Sunday: Floris, a son, to the Muslim Queen, and Blanchefleur, a daughter, to her lady-in-waiting. Floris (\\"belonging to the flower\\") and Blanchefleur (\\"white flower\\") are raised together at the court and grow close. King Felix fears his son may desire to marry the \\"pagan\\" girl and decides that she must be killed. However, he cannot bring himself to do the act and instead sends Floris away to school, then sells Blanchefleur to merchants traveling on the way to Cairo (called Babylon in the story), where she is then sold to the emir. Felix constructs an elaborate tomb for Blanchefleur and tells Floris she has died. Floris's reaction is so severe that Felix tells him the truth. Distraught but encouraged she is still alive, Floris sets out to find her. Floris eventually arrives outside Cairo where he meets the bridge warden named Daire who tells him about the emir's tower of maidens. Each year the emir selects a new bride from his tower and kills his old wife. Rumour has it that Blanchefleur is soon to be his next chosen bride. To gain access to the tower, Daire advises Floris to play chess with the tower watchman, returning all winnings to him until the watchman is forced to return the favor by allowing him entrance to the tower. Floris outplays the watchmen at chess, and according to plan, Floris is smuggled in to the tower in a basket of flowers, but is mistakenly placed in the room of Blanchefleur's friend Claris. Claris arranges a reunion between the two, but they are discovered two weeks later by the emir. The emir holds off killing them on the spot until he holds a council of advisers. So impressed are the advisers at the willingness of the young lovers to die for one another that they persuade the emir to spare their lives. Floris is then knighted, he and Blanchefleur are married, and Claris marries the emir (who promises Claris she will be his last and only wife, forever). Soon after, news of Felix's death reaches Cairo and Floris and Blanchefleur depart for home where they inherit the kingdom, embrace Christianity, and convert their subjects as well. =Middle English version= The poem tells of the troubles of the two eponymous lovers. Blancheflour (\\"white flower\\") is a Christian princess abducted by Saracens and raised with the pagan prince Flores (\\"belonging to the flower\\"). The two fall in love and separate. Blancheflour gives Flores a ring that will reflect her state, so that it will tarnish if she is in danger. Blancheflour is in a different caliphate from Flores, and there she is accused falsely and sent as a slave to a Tower of Maidens. The Emir has within his garden a \\"Tree of Love\\" that determines a new wife for him every year. Its flower will fall on the destined maiden from the harem, and yet he can also magically manipulate the tree to cast its flower upon a favorite. He has decided to make it fall on Blancheflour, for she is the loveliest virgin in the harem. Flores, knowing that Blancheflour is about to be taken by the Emir as a wife, comes to rescue her from her peril. The reunited lovers are found in bed (though they were chastely together) by the Emir the next morning. When he hears their whole tale of chaste love and long promises to one another, he demands proof of her virginity by having her put her hands in a water that will stain if she has been with a man. She is proven pure, he pardons both lovers, and all is well. Analysis The story contains elements of both older heroic sagas and romance. Unlike the usually bloody and martial Romances earlier in the period (e.g. Havelok the Dane), this Romance is, indeed, romantic. The older original \\"aristocratic\\" version does not contain knightly combat but the \\"popular\\" French version that would come later does contain some elements. The story contains themes of conflict between paganism and Christianity. Additionally, unlike other Romances, each section of the story is dependent strictly upon the previous section, so this poem has a linear plot. The poem also emphasizes the power of romantic love (rather than courtly love or divine favor) over force of arms to preserve life and ensure a good end. The Middle English version of the poem derives from an Old French \\"aristocratic\\" version (Floire et Blancheflor) of the tale. The story has analogs in Indian literature, particularly the Jatakas of the early fifth century. Many of the details, such as the Tower of Maidens (i.e. harem), eunuch guards, and the odalisques derive from material carried to the west via The Arabian Nights. The tale could be originally French, or possibly of Oriental origins, or a synthesis of motifs. Boccaccio wrote a version of the same tale in his \\"Filocolo\\", in 1336, while he was in Naples. The tale has been a popular subject for later retellings, and it was treated by Swedish poet Oskar Levertin in the romantic ballad \\"Flores och Blanzeflor\\" in the collection Legender och visor (Legends and Songs) in 1891.

He was crowned by a papal archbishop in Dorohochyn 1253 as the first King of Ruthenia (1253‚Äì1264). Daniel of Galicia is mentioned as King Daniel of Rus' by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine in his History of Mongols whom we call Tatars (Ystoria Mongalorum quos nos Tartaros appellamus).  Biography  He was also known as Danylo Romanovych. In 1205, after the death of his father, Roman II Mstyslavich, the ruler of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia, the boyars of Galicia forced the four-year-old Daniel into exile with his mother Anna of Byzantium and brother Vasylko Romanovich. After the boyars proclaimed one of their own as prince in 1213, the Poles and Hungarians invaded the principality, ostensibly to support the claims of young Daniel and Vasylko, and divided it between themselves. In 1219 he renounced his claims to Galicia in favor of his father-in-law Mstislav the Bold. In 1221 Daniel re-established his rule over Volhynia, where the boyars and populace had remained loyal to his dynasty. In 1234 he defeated Alexander Vsevolodovich, taking the Duchy of Belz. By 1238, he had defeated the Dobrzy≈Ñ Knights, and regained most of Galicia, including the capital at Galicia. While the Prussians were under pressure from the Teutonic Order, Daniel attempted to conquer the related Yatvingians. =Mongol invasion= The following year, with the advancing Mongols, the Grand Prince of Kiev Michael who was married to the Daniel's sister ran out of Kiev and asked Daniel for help. Daniel dispatch his voivode Dmytro to defend the city. However, after a long siege its walls were breached and despite fierce fighting within the city, Kiev fell on 6 December 1240 and was largely destroyed. A year later, the Mongols passed through Galicia and Volhynia while campaigning against the Poles and Hungarians, destroying Galicia. On 17 August 1245, Daniel defeated a combined force of the Prince of Chernihiv, disaffected boyars, and Hungarian and Polish (see also Order of Dobrin) elements at Yaroslav and finally took the remainder of Galicia, thus reconstituting his father's holdings. He made his brother Vasylko ruler of Volhynia and retained the Galician title for himself, though he continued to exercise real powers in both places. Territorial boundaries of the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia (1245-1349). Daniel's domestic policies focused on stability and economic growth. During his rule, German, Polish, and Rus' merchants and artisans were invited into Galicia, and numbers of Armenians and Jews established themselves in the towns and cities. Daniel founded the towns of Lviv (1256) (naming the former for his son) and Kholm, and fortified many others. He appointed officials to protect the peasantry from aristocratic exploitation and formed peasant-based heavy infantry units. Yet Daniel's successes and his failed defense of Kiev attracted the further attention of the Mongols. In 1246, he was summoned to the capital of the Golden Horde at Sarai on the Volga River and was forced to accept Mongol overlordship. According to the Ukrainian historian Orest Subtelny, Daniel was handed a cup of fermented mare's milk by the Mongol khan Batu and told to get used to it, as \\"you are one of ours now.\\" They exchanged hostages whereby 100 families of Keraites were re-settled in Carpathian Galicia. According to James ChambersChambers, James. The Devil¬¥s Horsemen. The Mongol Invasion of Europe. New York 1979. page 120 the following dialogue took place between Batu and Daniel of Galicia: At a banquet Batu asked if he drank kumiz like the Mongols and Daniel answered: \\"Until now I did not, but now I do as you command and I drink it.\\" To which Batu replied: \\"You are now one of ours,\\" and since he was more used to it ordered that Daniel be given a goblet of wine. While formally accepting the Mongols as overlords, and supplying them with soldiers as required, Daniel built a foreign policy around opposition to the Golden Horde. He established cordial relations with the rulers of Kingdom of Poland and Kingdom of Hungary, and requested aid from Pope Innocent IV in the form of a crusade. In return for papal assistance, Daniel offered to place his lands under the ecclesiastical authority of Rome, a pledge never realized. Wooed by the prospect of extending his authority, the pope encouraged Daniel's resistance to the Mongols and his Western orientation, and in 1253, had a papal representative crown Daniel at Dorohochyn on the Bug River. Danylo wanted more than recognition, however, and commented bitterly that he expected an army when he received the crown.John Joseph Saunders. (2001). The history of the Mongol conquests. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, p. 101 The following year, Daniel repelled Mongol assaults led by Orda's son, Kuremsa, on Ponyzia and Volhynia and dispatched an expedition with the aim of taking Kiev. Despite initial successes, in 1259, a Mongol force under Burundai and Nogai Khan entered Galicia and Volhynia and offered an ultimatum: Daniel was to destroy his fortifications or Burundai would assault the towns. Daniel complied and pulled down the city walls. Monument of King Danylo in Lviv. In the last years of his reign, Daniel engaged in dynastic politics, marrying a son and a daughter to the offspring of Mindaugas of Grand Duchy of Lithuania and acquiring territorial concessions in Poland from the latter. Another daughter of his, Ustynia, was married to Prince Andrey Yaroslavich of Vladimir-Suzdal. He also arranged for the marriage of his son Roman to Gertrude, the Babenberg heiress, but was unsuccessful in his bid to have him placed on the ducal throne of Austria. By his death in 1264, Daniel had reconstructed and expanded the territories held by his father, held off the expansionist threats of Poland and Hungary, minimized Mongol influence on Western Ukraine, and raised the economic and social standards of his domains. He was succeeded in Galicia by his son Lev.  Honours  A monument to him was erected in 2001 in Lviv. Another one is in Halych. Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport is named after him.

Though the appellation covers the largest amount of land, it is second in actual size under vine to Crozes-Hermitage, an appellation with which it shares much regarding style and prestige. While St.-Joseph is primarily a red wine region based on the Syrah grape, there may be up to 10% Marsanne and Roussanne included per AOC regulations. History Originally known as Vin de Mauves, mentioned in Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables, the wine from St.-Joseph was a favourite in the French court of Louis XII (1498‚Äì1515) who owned a vineyard in St.-Joseph known as Clos de Tournon. The first official record of vineyards in St. Joseph occurs in 1668. St. Joseph is a saint, allegedly the protector of scorned husbands, and the appellation is named from a vineyard that was first named for that saint. This particular vineyard (called simply Saint Joseph) was originally owned by Jesuits and is now owned by the famous winemaker Guigal. The modern-day St.-Joseph begins its history around 1916, but did not gain its own AOC until 1956. Before 1969 it was a small appellation covering less than 100 hectares, but in 1971 it was decided to expand the appellation to it present size. In 1994 the potential size of the appellation was capped at 3000 hectares. Originally it was a wine based on pure Syrah, but since 1979 it has been permitted to include as much as 10% white grapes.Niels Lillelund: Rh√¥ne- Vinene JP B√∏ger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 97-98 Climate and geography St.-Joseph, along with the rest of Northern Rh√¥ne has a continental climate that differs from its southern neighbour, which has a more Mediterranean climate. Winters are wet and marked by the cold le mistral winds that can last into the Spring. The appellation is the second largest appellation in the Northern Rh√¥ne covering 920 hectares.Niels Lillelund: Rh√¥ne-Vinene JP B√∏ger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 104 The classic part of the appellation begins in the south around the villages Mauves and Tournon. This part of St.-Joseph lies fairly high and these fields are regarded as the best of the appellation. 50 km to the north, when the appellation approaches Cote-Rotie, the soil is more rich and the wines differ from the classic southern wines.Niels Lillelund: Rh√¥ne-Vinene JP B√∏ger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 98-99 Grapes and wine Similar to the Northern Rh√¥ne in general, Syrah is the only red grape allowed in St.-Joseph. AOC regulations allow for the addition of up to 10% Marsanne and/or Roussanne, both of which are white varietals. The white wines can be made from any amount of Marsanne and/or Roussanne grapes. Many of the red wines are meant to be consumed \\"while waiting for Hermitage and Cote-Rotie to mature.\\"Niels Lillelund: Rh√¥ne-Vinene JP B√∏ger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 99 The best wines are found in the south and the vines in this region can be upwards of 100 years old.Niels Lillelund: Rh√¥ne-Vinene JP B√∏ger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 98 Generally the wines are defined by the young fruit that makes them very drinkable while young.

The term, revenge tragedy, was first introduced in 1900 by A. H. Thorndike to label a class of plays written in the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras (circa 1580s to 1620s).Kerrigan, John. Revenge Tragedy: Aeschylus to Armageddon. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1996. Print. Origins Most scholars argue that the revenge tragedies of William Shakespeare and his contemporaries stemmed from Roman tragedy, in particular, Seneca's Thyestes.Bowers, Fredson Theyer. Elizabethan Revenge Tragedy: 1587‚Äì1642. Glaucester, MA: Peter Smith. 1959. Print. p. 41. Seneca's tragedies followed three main themes: the inconsistency of fortune (Troades), stories of crime and the evils of murder (Thyestes), and plays in which poverty, chastity and simplicity are celebrated (Hippolytus). In Thyestes, Seneca portrayed the evil repercussions of murder. In order to exact revenge on his brother Thyestes for adultery with his wife, Atreus lures him to Argos under the pretext of a shared rule, but instead tricks him into eating the cooked flesh of his own children.Kerrigan, John. Revenge Tragedy: Aeschylus to Armageddon. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1996. Print. p. 111. Seneca's criminals (in this case Thyestes) are always deserving of their punishment unless they repent, since he believed the will to do evil is entirely in the hands of the individual, who must therefore be appropriately punished.Bowers, Fredson Theyer. Elizabethan Revenge Tragedy: 1587‚Äì1642. Glaucester, MA: Peter Smith. 1959. Print. p. 42. This ethical logic becomes complicated, however, since the revenging murder is also a crime, transforming the revenger into a criminal, and thus prompting retribution on behalf of the punished. Conventions of revenge plays *The ghost of the murdered victim urges revenge (Hamlet, Spanish Tragedy), *Metatheatricality *Madness *Murder *Cannibalism History/Development The revenge tragedy was established on the Elizabethan stage with Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy in 1587. In this play, Hieronimo's discovery of his son Horatio's dead body leads him into a brief fit of madness, after which he discovers the identity of his son's murderers and plans his revenge through a play-within-a-play. It is during this play that he enacts his revenge, after which he kills himself.Kyd, Thomas. ‚ÄúSpanish Tragedy.‚Äù Five Revenge Tragedies. Ed. Emma Smith. New York: Penguin. Print. With Hieronimo's quest for justice in the face of a seemingly powerless state, Spanish Tragedy introduced the thematic issues of retributive justice that would be explored as the genre gained popularity and developed on the Elizabethan and Jacobean stage.Smith, Emma. \\"Introduction.\\" Five Revenge Tragedies. Ed. Emma Smith. New York: Penguin. Print. The distinction and cultural contention between public and private revenge has been considered by some to be the defining theme of not only early modern revenge tragedy but all early modern tragedy. The tension between public and private revenge, then, has also led to disputes between whether the protagonists enacting private revenge are heroes or villains: is Hieronimo, a character who seeks private revenge to gain retribution for the private murder of his son, a villain or a hero? Believed to have been staged shortly afterwards, Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus is another early piece of the genre in which the dangerous cycle of revenge through private justice is brought to the fore and the typical features of the genre can be found. In this play, Titus' murder of Tamora's eldest son in a ritual of war leads to the rape and mutilation of his daughter Lavinia. As his revenge, Titus murders Tamora's remaining sons, bakes them into pie, and serves them to her at a feast.Shakespeare, William. ‚ÄúTitus Andronicus.‚Äù Folger Shakespeare Library. Ed. Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine. New York: Washington Square Press. 2005. One of the great contentions of the revenge tragedy is the issue of private revenge vs. divine revenge or public (i.e. state sanctioned) revenge.Woodbridge, Linda. English Revenge Drama. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2010. Print. P. 41. In his essay, \\"Of Revenge,\\" Francis Bacon writes: \\"the first wrong, it doth but offend the law; but the revenge of that wrong, putteth the Law out of Office. Certainly, in taking revenge, a man is but even with his Enemy. But in passing it over, he is Superior: For it is a princes part to Pardon.\\"Bacon, Francis. \\"Of Revenge\\". http://www.folger.edu/eduPrimSrcDtl.cfm?psid=123 As the genre gained popularity, playwrights explored the issue of private vs. public or state justice through the introduction of a variety of revenge characters. In Antonio's Revenge, John Marston creates a character named Pandulpho who embodies an idea from the Spanish Tragedy of the Senecan stoic.Marston, John. \\"Antonio's Revenge\\". Five Revenge Tragedies. Ed. Emma Smith. New York: Penguin. Print. The Senecan stoic is not ruled by emotions but rather follows a balance of cosmic determinism and human freedom to avoid misfortune.Stoicism In Hamlet, Shakespeare explores the complexities of the very human desire for revenge in the face of stoic philosophy and ethics. Throughout the play, Hamlet struggles to avenge his father's murder (as has been demanded of him by his father's ghost), and only does so in the end by mischance.Shakespeare, William. \\"Hamlet\\".

The Atheist's Tragedy by Cyril Tourneur followed an anti-revenge plot by having Montferrer's ghost explicitly order his son Charlemont not to seek revenge in order to avoid the villainy of violence.Tourner, Cyril.

Reaction Scholars have examined the themes of the revenge tragedy in the context of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period as a way to understand its rapid growth in popularity.Woodbridge, Linda. English Revenge Drama. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2010. Print. For some, the fact that plays openly question the morality of revenge and taking justice into one's own hands is evidence that the public was morally opposed to the concept.Bowers, Fredson Theyer. Elizabethan Revenge Tragedy: 1587‚Äì1642. Glaucester, MA: Peter Smith. 1959. Print. For others, however, the popularity of the genre is evidence that the plays expressed the frustrations and desires for justice against oppressive governance of the public. Film Numerous adaptations have been made of revenge plays. Excluding films based on Hamlet, these include: *Julie Taymor's Titus *Alex Cox's Revengers Tragedy *Marcus Thompson's Middleton's Changeling *Peter Greenaway's The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover and Lars von Trier's Dogville are original works in the revenge-play style. *Todd Field's In the Bedroom *Park Chan-wook's Oldboy Music *Sound Horizon's M√§rchen is an original work which has revenge tragedies as its central theme.

Formally established by American educator Ashley H. Thorndike in his 1902 article \\"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,\\" a revenge tragedy documents the progress of the protagonist's revenge plot and often leads to the demise of both the murderers and the avenger himself.Thorndike, A. H. \\"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays.\\" Modern Language Association. 17.2 (1902): 125-220. Print. The genre first appeared in early modern Britain with the publication of Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy during the latter half of the 16th century. Earlier works, such as Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca (1560s) and Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville's play Gorbuduc (1561), are also considered revenge tragedies. Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's Hamlet (c.1599-1602), Titus Andronicus (c.1588-1593), and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy (c.1606). Revenge tragedy as a genre The genre of revenge tragedy is a modern invention, developed as a means of explaining early modern tragedies that maintain a theme or motif of revenge in varying degrees. Classification of the revenge tragedy is at times contentious, as with other early modern theatrical genres.Shakespeare's First Folio Lawrence Danson suggested that Shakespeare and his contemporaries had a \\"healthy ability to live comfortably with the unruliness of a theatre where the genre was not static but moving and mixing, always producing new possibilities.\\"Danson, Lawrence. Shakespeare's Dramatic Genres. Oxford University Press, Oxford: 2000. Print. p. 11. On the contrary, Shakespeare's 1623 First Folio famously depicts the printer-imposed (William Jaggard and Edward Blount) three genres of comedy, history, and tragedy, leading readers to falsely believe that plays are easily categorized and contained.The First Folio, printed after his death, was also prepared by Shakespeare's colleagues John Heminges and Henry Condell. While these three genres have remained staples in discussions of genre, other genres are often either invoked or created to accommodate the generic slipperiness of early modern drama. These include not only revenge tragedy, but also city comedy, romance, pastoral, and problem play, among others. It is common to consider any tragedy containing an element of revenge a revenge tragedy. Lily Campbell argues that revenge is the great thematic uniter of all early modern tragedy, and \\"all Elizabethan tragedy must appear as fundamentally a tragedy of revenge if the extent of the idea of revenge be but grasped.\\"Campbell, Lily. \\"Theories of Revenge in Renaissance England.\\" Modern Philology. 28.3 (1931) 281-296. Print. Fredson Bowers's work (1959) on the genre not only widened and complicated what revenge tragedy is, but also increased its function as a productive lens in the work of dramatic interpretation. For example, Titus Andronicus was originally marketed in the First Folio as The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus. Hamlet was similarly titled in the First Folio as The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark and The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark in the Second Quarto edition (1604). It's not unusual to find present- day editors classifying these plays as tragedies;Engle, Lars. Introduction to The Duchess of Malfi. The Duchess of Malfi. By John Webster. English Renaissance Drama. Eds. David Bevington, et al. Norton, New York: 2002. 1749-1754. Print. p. 1749.Weis, Rene. Introduction. John Webster: The Duchess of Malfi and Other Plays. By John Webster. Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1996. ix-xxviii. Print. p. xxiii however, it is becoming increasingly common to also read and interpret early modern drama with other genres in mind, such as revenge tragedy. Generic conventions While these conventions don't apply to all plays that can be considered revenge tragedies, the events listed are common within the genre: * The avenger is killed * Spectacle for the sake of spectacle * Villains and accomplices that assist the avenger are killed * The supernatural (often in the form of a ghost who urges the protagonist to seek vengeance) * A play within a play, or dumb show * Madness or feigned madness * Disguise * Violent murders, including decapitation and dismemberment * Soliloquies * A Machiavellian figure * Cannibalism (Thyestean banquets) * A fifth and final act where many characters are killed (multiple corpses on the stage) * Degeneration of a once-noble protagonist * In later Jacobean and Caroline revenge tragedies, the protagonist is more often a villain than a hero (though this is subjective) * In later revenge tragedies, there is often more than one character who seeks revenge  Significant revenge tragedy playwrights  =Lucius Seneca= Lucius Seneca was a prominent playwright of the first century, famous for helping shape the genre of revenge tragedy with his ten plays: Hercules Furens, Troades, Phoenissae, Medea, Phaedra, Oedipus, Agamemnon, Thyestes, Hercules Oetaeus, and Octavia.Alkhaleefah, Tarek A. \\"The Senecan Tragedy and its Adaptation for the Elizabethan Stage: A Study of Thomas Kyd‚Äôs The Spanish Tragedy.\\" International Journal of English and Literature 6.9 (Sept. 2015): 163-167. Print. The importance of his plays lies in the difficulty of the period. While the Elizabethan tragedy was considered more acceptable, revenge tragedy sought to unleash the carnal side of human nature on stage in a much more grotesque way. It was a transitional time in the literary world that would eventually lead to grueling pieces like these. Infamous scenes like the cannibalistic feast in Thyestes introduce the audience to another dimension of the human experience, challenging them to reflect on extreme emotions and dig deeper into the conventions of the genre. Seneca‚Äôs Thyestes, a tale of revenge and horror with prominent cannibalism, can be identified as one of the first \\"revenge pieces\\". In the power struggle between two brothers, Atreus and Thyestes, there is a clear theme of revenge. The underlying plot is Thyestes's affair with Atreus' wife. He stole his treasured golden fleece, and sneakily took the throne of Mycenae from him. After a long period of exile, Thyestes is allowed to return to Mycenae. However, the conflict escalates when Atreus executes his revenge by tricking Thyestes into eating his children. Although overtly grotesque, this piece of literature follows the conventions of the revenge tragedy genre. =William Shakespeare= William Shakespeare was an English poet and playwright from the 16th century. Through plays like Hamlet and Titus Andronicus, Shakespeare portrayed the basic characteristics of a revenge tragedy. He presented elements that are quite similar to those from Seneca's tragedies, establishing tragedy as a more well-known genre. Titus Andronicus depicts the madness of Titus, who wanted to take revenge on Tamora and her sons for what they did to Lavinia and Bassianus. This leads him to kill everybody that he faced in his search to satisfy himself and avenge them. The main plot focuses on Titus's revenge against Tamora and her sons, but also there are other people to whom he seeks vengeance. This is an element that can define a revenge tragedy. The appearance of cannibalism in the last scene at the banquet and grotesque elements during the play relate Titus Andronicus to Seneca's earlier revenge tragedies.

The independently produced film was co-produced and directed by Taylor Hackford, and written by James L. White from a story by Hackford and White. It stars Jamie Foxx in the title role, along with Kerry Washington, Clifton Powell, Harry Lennix, Terrence Dashon Howard, Larenz Tate, Richard Schiff and Regina King in supporting roles. Along with Hackford, the film was also produced by Stuart Benjamin, Howard Baldwin and Karen Baldwin. It was released on October 29, 2004 by Universal Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Foxx's performance. It was also a commercial success, grossing $124.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $40 million. Ray received many accolades and nominations and was nominated twice at the 77th Academy Awards. For his performance, Foxx won the Academy Award for Best Actor as well as the Golden Globe, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, and Critics' Choice, becoming the second actor to win all five major lead actor awards for the same performance, and the only one to win the Golden Globe in the Musical or Comedy, rather than in the Drama category. Charles was set to attend an opening of the completed film, but died of liver disease in June 2004, months prior to the premiere. Plot In 1948, young Ray Charles Robinson, the blind son of a sharecropper, boards a bus at a rest stop in northern Florida. Ray lies to the racist bus driver about losing his sight at Omaha Beach in 1944 during the war to get a free ride. He travels to Seattle, Washington where he uses his unexpected talent for the piano to get a job playing for a nightclub band. The club's owner (Denise Dowse) soon begins to exploit Ray, demanding sexual favors and controlling his money and career. After discovering that he is being lied to and stolen from, Ray leaves the band in disgust. In 1950, Ray joins a white country band who make him wear sunglasses to hide his damaged eyes from audiences. They go on tour, and Ray is introduced to heroin. He also suffers from traumatic flashbacks relating to his childhood in the 1930s. The elder of two brothers, Ray is raised by a fiercely independent single mother, Aretha Robinson. The family is poor, but young Ray finds solace in music. He learns to play the piano from a man at a local store. At age five, Ray is playing with his younger brother George in front of their house when George slips into their mother's full washbasin. Ray laughs at first, thinking George is goofing off, but becomes paralyzed with shock as his brother's limbs thrash violently in the soapy water, scrambling to escape. Aretha rushes to pull George from the water, but it is too late. Ray feels immense guilt over his brother's death, and begins to develop vision problems soon afterward. By age seven, he is completely blind. His mother teaches him to be independent despite his condition, and makes him swear that he will never let the world \\"turn him into a cripple.\\" Eventually, she sends Ray to a school for the deaf and blind, weeping as her only remaining son boards a bus and disappears. As Ray travels on the road, he demands to be paid in single dollar bills so no one can cheat him. We see another flashback of Ray playing with a country band and the man counting single $1 notes by implying they are $20 to pay Ray. Luckily another band member steps up and demands Ray be paid fairly. As Ray is becoming more and more popular with his music, a man from Atlantic Records discovers him. The man has written a song and offers to let Ray sing it. The song, \\"The Mess Around\\" becomes Ray's first hit. Ray ends up meeting Della Bea, a preacher's daughter. He falls in love with her, and the two get married. Della is not happy about Ray mixing gospel and soul music, but realizes he's got undeniable talent. Ray goes out on the road, and meets up with Mary Anne Fisher, a singer who teams up with Ray. On a trip home, Della Bea finds Ray's drugs in his shaving bag, and demands he stop using. Ray refuses, and walks out on a pregnant Della Bea. Ray begins an affair with Mary Anne. As Ray's popularity grows, Ray gets a girl trio to become \\"The Raylettes\\". Ray immediately falls for Margie's (Regina King), the lead singer's charms, and the two begin an affair. Another few years later, Ray is out on the road as a headliner, and one night while doing a set, the band finishes early. The owner of the club demands Ray fill the 20 minute slot he has left, and Ray makes up the hit \\"What I'd Say\\" on the spot. During the 1960s, Ray is becoming more and more popular. Ray is offered a better contract with another record label, and although he is loyal to Atlantic, Ray leaves them, but on amicable terms. Ray goes to Atlanta to play a concert, and encounters civil rights protests. Ray protests by saying that he will not play if the black concertgoers have to sit in the balcony. Ray ends up being barred from the state of Georgia. Another year or so later, Ray then wants to try and do different things with his music, and incorporates classical and country into his sound. Some of his biggest hits come from this mixture, such as \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" which Margie says will be Ray's downfall. Ray also records \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\", for which he receives a standing ovation at one concert. While sleeping in a hotel room, Ray's sleep is interrupted by the police who burst in and arrest him. They tell him that they are acting on an anonymous tip that he has drugs in the room and are there to arrest him. Although heroin is found and Ray is charged with possession, he gets off on a legal technicality because the police didn't have a search warrant. Later, while in a hotel room with Margie, Ray is tinkling on the piano while she gets sick. Margie is pregnant, and demands Ray leave Della and his three children with her. Ray refuses, and Margie is angry. Ray tells Margie to keep her anger, while he literally writes \\"Hit the Road Jack\\" complete with Margie's solo. Now that she's got her name out there, Margie leaves the Raylettes to try and make a solo career for herself. In the early 1970s, Ray and Della Bea move into a huge new house with their kids. Della is uncomfortable in the new house. Ray has to go to Canada for another concert. When he gets off the plane, he is arrested for possession of heroin, his concert is canceled, and the Canadian authorities deport Ray back to the USA. The record company has trouble getting him out of this trouble and a judge sentences Ray to go to a treatment clinic. Della and Ray fight about this and the phone rings. Picking up the phone, Ray learns from someone on the other line that Margie is dead... from a drug overdose. Ray swears to Della that he never turned her onto it and wouldn't let her use it when she was around him. Della says she will start sending money to Ray's child with Margie, but Ray tells Della he already sends him money. Ray goes to a rehab clinic where he suffers from withdrawal and nightmares. One night, Ray has a conversation with his dead mother, who chastises him for letting drugs cripple him. Ray tries to apologize, but his mother won't hear of it. Then his little brother George shows up and tells him that he doesn't blame him for his death. In 1979 Ray gets off drugs for good and receives his proudest accomplishment, the state of Georgia officially apologizes to Ray and makes \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" the official state song. Ray, Della, and their three grown sons receive applause after Ray performs the song before a live audience. Cast * Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles ** C. J.

Taylor Hackford said in a DVD bonus feature that it took 15 years to make the film; or more specifically, as he later clarified in the liner notes of the soundtrack album, this is how long it took him to secure the financing. It was made on a budget of $40 million. Charles was given a Braille copy of the film's original script; he objected only to a scene showing him taking up piano grudgingly, and a scene implying that Charles had shown mistress and lead \\"Raelette\\" Margie Hendricks how to shoot heroin. Ray debuted at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Soundtrack Reception =Box office= Ray was released in theaters on October 29, 2004. The film went on to become a box-office hit, earning $75 million in the U.S. with an additional $50 million internationally, bringing its worldwide gross to $125 million. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 206 reviews, with an average rating of 7.30/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"An engrossing and energetic portrait of a great musician's achievements and foibles, Ray is anchored by Jamie Foxx's stunning performance as Ray Charles.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 73% based on reviews from 40 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \\"A+\\" grade. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"The movie would be worth seeing simply for the sound of the music and the sight of Jamie Foxx performing it. That it looks deeper and gives us a sense of the man himself is what makes it special.\\" Ebert gave it a full 4 out of 4 stars. Richard Corliss of Time praised the cast, saying \\"If there were an Oscar for ensemble acting, Ray would win in a stroll.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"Jamie Foxx gets so far inside the man and his music that he and Ray Charles seem to breathe as one.\\" According to music critic Robert Christgau, \\"Foxx does the impossible‚Äîradiates something approaching the charisma of the artist he's portraying... that's the only time an actor has ever brought a pop icon fully to life on-screen.\\" =Awards= =Differences from noted events= The film's credits state that Ray is based on true events, but includes some characters, names, locations, and events which have been changed and others which have been \\"fictionalized for dramatization purposes.\\" Examples of the fictionalized scenes include: * The film's portrayal of Charles' brother George's death in 1935 shows him drowning in a metal tub after Ray doesn't attempt to rescue him because he assumes he is just playing; Ray's mother then discovers George drowning when calling the boys in for dinner. Though George did drown in a metal tub, Ray did try to pull him out, but was unable to do so due to George's large body weight; Ray then ran inside to tell his mother what happened. * Throughout the film, it is suggested that Ray's depression and heroin addiction were fueled by nervous breakdowns he had over the deaths of both George and his mother, as well as his blindness. In reality, the death of his mother did give him a nervous breakdown and was thought to be a leading cause of his depression, but the death of George and his blindness did not lead to nervous breakdowns. * It is true that Charles kicked his heroin addiction after undergoing treatment in a psychiatric hospital during 1965, as stated towards the end of the film, but it is not mentioned that he would often use gin and marijuana as substitutes for heroin throughout much of the remaining years of his life. * In the scene in which \\"What'd I Say\\" is being played, Charles is depicted as playing a Fender Rhodes electric piano, but in reality, he used a Wurlitzer electric piano on the original recording and began using it on tour in 1956, because he didn't trust the tuning and quality of the pianos provided to him at every venue.Evans, p. 109. * In the film, when his backing singer and mistress Margie Hendricks informs Ray she is pregnant with his child, Ray suggests she should have an abortion, out of loyalty to Della; Margie decides to keep the baby and soon leaves Ray to pursue a separate singing career after he refuses to abandon his family, move in with her and welcome the baby into his life. In reality, Hendricks did conceive a child with Charles and abandoned him after he refused to leave Della, but Charles never asked her to have an abortion, and welcomed any child he conceived, whether from Della or any mistress, into his personal life. * In the scene in which Charles is about to enter a segregated music hall in Augusta, Georgia, in 1962, a group of civil rights activists protesting just outside the hall successfully persuade him not to perform; Charles then declares that he will no longer perform in segregated public facilities and in response, the Georgia state legislature passes a resolution banning Charles from ever performing again in the state. In reality, a group of civil rights activists did successfully persuade Charles to reject this invitation, but the advice came in the form of a telegram rather than a street protest; Charles also did make up for the gig later, and was never banned from performing in Georgia and still accepted invitations to perform at segregated public facilities. * In the film, Margie Hendricks dies in 1964‚Äì5. In reality, she died in 1973 of a heroin overdose. * During the final scene in the film, when Charles' version of \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" becomes Georgia's state song, Charles is congratulated by his wife Della, and a resolution is also passed to lift the lifetime ban he had received in 1962 after he declared he would no longer perform at segregated public facilities. In reality, by the time \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" became Georgia's state song in 1979, Charles and Della had already divorced, so she wasn't present when Charles performed at the Georgia State Legislature; and since he had never been banned from performing in Georgia in the first place, no such resolution was ever passed.

The journal publishes original, peer-reviewed papers in the areas of experimental, theoretical, applied, and mathematical physics and related areas. The current editor-in-chief is Stefan Hildebrandt. Prior to 2008, its ISO 4 abbreviation was Ann. Phys. (Leipzig), and after 2008 Ann. Phys. (Berl.). The journal is the successor to Journal der Physik published from 1790 until 1794, and Neues Journal der Physik published from 1795 until 1797. The journal has been published under a variety of names (Annalen der Physik, Annalen der Physik und der physikalischen Chemie, Annalen der Physik und Chemie, Wiedemann's Annalen der Physik und Chemie) during its history. History Originally, Annalen der Physik was published in German, then a leading scientific language. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the journal published in both German and English. Initially, only foreign authors contributed articles in English but from the 1970s German-speaking authors increasingly wrote in English in order to reach an international audience. After the German reunification in 1990, English became the only language of the journal. The importance of Annalen der Physik unquestionably peaked in 1905 with Albert Einstein's Annus Mirabilis papers. In the 1920s, the journal lost ground to the concurrent Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik. With the 1933 emigration wave, German-language journals lost many of their best authors. During Nazi Germany, it was considered to represent \\"the more conservative elements within the German physics community\\", alongside Physikalische Zeitschrift. From 1944‚Äì1946 publication was interrupted because of World War II, but resumed in 1947 under Soviet occupation rule. While Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik moved to Western Germany, Annalen der Physik served physicists in East Germany. After the German reunification, the journal was acquired by Wiley-VCH. A relaunch of the journal with new editor and new contents was announced for 2012.Annalen der Physik (announcement). Wiley Online Library. (retrieved 17-aug-2011). As a result of the 2012 relaunch, Annalen der Physik now features a refocused scope, an updated editorial board, and new, more modern cover designs. =Editors= The early editors-in-chief were: * Friedrich Albrecht Carl Gren (1790‚Äì1797) (as Journal der Physik and Neues Journal der Physik) * Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert (1799‚Äì1824) (as Annalen der Physik and Annalen der Physik und der physikalischen Chemie) * Johann Christian Poggendorff (1824‚Äì1876) (as Annalen der Physik und Chemie) * Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann (1877‚Äì1899) (as Annalen der Physik und Chemie) * Paul Karl Ludwig Drude (1900‚Äì1906) (as Annalen der Physik) With each editor, the numbering of volumes restarted from 1 (co-existent with a continuous numbering, a perpetual source of confusion). The journal was often referred to by the editor's name: Gilberts Annalen, Poggendorfs Annalen, Wiedemann's Annalen and so on, or for short Pogg. Ann., Wied. Ann. After Drude, the work was divided between two editors: experimentalists Wilhelm Wien (1907‚Äì1928) and Eduard Gr√ºneisen (1929‚Äì1949) and theoretician Max Planck (1907‚Äì1943, had been associate editor from 1895). In these times, peer-review was not yet standard. Einstein, for example, just sent his manuscripts to Planck who then subsequently published them. =Notable published works= Some of the most famous papers published in Annalen der Physik were: * on stretched exponential relaxation by Rudolf Kohlrausch (1854) * on stretched exponential relaxation by Friedrich Kohlrausch (1863,1876), * on the photoelectric effect by Heinrich Hertz (1887), * on the theory of blackbody radiation by Max Planck (1901), * on capillarity by Albert Einstein (1901), * the Annus Mirabilis papers by Albert Einstein on photons, on Brownian motion, on mass‚Äìenergy equivalence, and on the special theory of relativity, (1905) * on the heat capacities of solids with quantized energy levels by Einstein (1907), * on molecular motion near absolute zero by Einstein and Otto Stern (1913), * on the general theory of relativity by Einstein (1916) Abstracting and indexing The journal is abstracted and indexed in: According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 3.443, ranking it 11th out of 79 journals in the category 'Physics Multidisciplinary'.

It was laid out in the first survey of Melbourne, the original 1837 Hoddle Grid, and soon became the most desired address in the city. Collins Street was named after Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania (then Van Diemen's Land) David Collins who led a group of settlers in establishing a short-lived settlement at Sorrento in 1803.Judith Buckrich: Collins ‚Äì The Story of Australia's Premier Street, 2005, The eastern end of Collins Street has been known colloquially as the 'Paris End' since the 1950s due to its numerous heritage buildings, old street trees, high-end shopping boutiques, and as the location for the first sidewalk cafes in the city. As with all main streets in the Melbourne city centre, the Hoddle Grid is exactly 99 feet wide which would allow for the installation of trams in the 1885. Blocks further west centred around Queen Street became the financial heart of Melbourne in the 19th century, the preferred home of major banks and insurance companies, a tradition which continues today with the most prestigious office blocks and skyscrapers found along its length. History = 19th century = Wurundjeri people at Collins Street, 1839 As laid out by the surveyor Robert Hoddle, it was exactly one mile in length and one and half chains () wide. The street was named for Lieutenant-Governor David Collins who led a group of settlers in establishing a short-lived settlement at Sorrento on the Mornington Peninsula, south of Melbourne, in the early 19th century. He subsequently became the first governor of the colony of Van Diemen's Land, later to become the state of Tasmania. At the western end of the street was Batman's Hill, named for the Tasmanian adventurer and grazier John Batman, who built a house at the base in April 1836, where he lived until his death in 1839. The first major street improvements were carried out in the mid-1850s, including bluestone curbs and gutters, and the introduction of gas lighting in 1855. The first street trees were elms, planted in 1875. A cable tram line was laid in 1886 and was operational until 1930 when it was electrified. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the top end of Collins Street, known as Collins Street East, was dominated by the rooms of medical professionals. The prestigious Melbourne Club was a dominant cultural presence after its founding in 1838. Collins Street was also the location of Grosvenor Chambers (9 Collins Street) which was Australia's first custom designed studio complex, and was used by many prominent Australian artists.see Alex Taylor, Perils of the Studio: Inside the Artistic Affairs of Bohemian Melbourne, Australian Scholarly Publishing & State Library of Victoria: North Melbourne, 2007 With the development of the suburbs, the doctors residences along Collins Street East (now known as the 'Paris End'), which were set back from the street by substantial gardens, the doctors offices were relocated and shopfronts were built in place. = 20th century = Collins Street, 1910 Around the turn of the 20th century \\"doing the Block,\\" or walking around in one's finest clothing to be seen, became a pastime for shoppers at the Block Arcade in the retail heart of Collins street, between Elizabeth and Swanston Streets. During the 1950s and 1960s, the street became subject to extensive redevelopment and many historic buildings were demolished by Whelan the Wrecker, despite the efforts of the National Trust and the \\"Save Collins Street\\" group. While some examples of boom style architecture survive, the grandest examples were lost to the wrecker's ball. Of the major losses, the most significant were the large Victorian buildings including the Federal Coffee Palace, Colonial Mutual Life building, Robb's buildings, Queen Victoria Buildings, City of Melbourne Bank, Scott's Hotel, Melbourne Mansions and APA building. Many of the buildings destroyed in this era were documented by architectural photographer Mark Strizic and can be found in the archives of the State Library of Victoria. One of the most popular public art statues in Melbourne, Larry La Trobe created by artist Pamela Irving, faces Collins Street from the northern end of Melbourne City Square. = 21st century = Between 2003‚Äì05, Collins Street was extended west beyond its previous termination at Spencer Street, starting with the opening of the bridge over Southern Cross station and Wurundjeri Way on 18 December 2002, with the street ending outside the new ANZ and Myer headquarters further in the Docklands development. It has since been extended further west to create an intersection between Bourke Street and Collins Streets, two of Melbourne's most important streets. Architecture Scots' Church dwarfed by 120 Collins Street As Melbourne's commercial and former shopping centre, Collins Street possesses some of Melbourne's best examples of Victorian architecture. Large churches include the Collins Street Baptist Church (1845), the St Michael's Uniting Church (1866) and the Scot's Presbyterian Church (1874). Significant commercial buildings include Alston's Corner (1914) by Nahum Barnet is an excellent surviving example of Edwardian architecture, while the Block Arcade by D.C Askew (1893) is an excellent example of high Victorian mannerist architecture. Towards the financial end are some great examples of high Victorian gothic architecture or \\"Cathedrals of Commerce\\". They include William Pitt's Venetian Gothic style Old Stock Exchange (1888), William Wardell's Gothic Bank (1883) which features some of Melbourne's finest interiors and A.C Goode House designed by Wright, Reed & Beaver (1891). The old Commercial Bank of Australia Limited domed Chamber exists within the post modern 333 Collins Street tower. It was designed by Lloyd Tayler and Alfred Dunn and built in 1891. Some of Australia's tallest buildings are along Collins Street, including the Rialto Towers, Collins Place towers 1 & 2, Nauru House, 120 Collins Street and 101 Collins Street and ANZ World Headquarters (at 380 Collins Street, which is integrated into the old Stock Exchange and Gothic Bank). The Bank of New South Wales Melbourne building, completed in 1857, earned architect Joseph Reed a first prize in architecture. When the building was demolished in 1935, the facade was transplanted to the University of Melbourne in Parkville to become the Commerce Building. It is now retained on the facade of the new building being constructed for the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning. Shopping and boutiques Block Arcade Interior of Strozzi, 333 Collins Street Collins Street is Melbourne's premier shopping street and retailers with flagship stores there include: Prada, Louis Vuitton, Emporio Armani, Tiffany & Co, BVLGARI, Giorgio Armani, Dior, Bottega Veneta, Celine, TAG Heuer, Paspaley, Cartier, Gucci, Ermenegildo Zegna, Burberry, Bally, Coach, Max Mara, Herm√®s, Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Louboutin, Fendi, Versace, Berluti, Chopard, Tom Ford, Hugo Boss, Van Cleef & Arpels, Omega, Georg Jensen, Paul Smith, Thomas Pink, Longchamp, Aesop, Wolford, Montblanc, Franck Muller, Harrolds.

Noteworthy businesses  Athenaeum Two theatres, the Athenaeum and Regent theatres, are both located on Collins Street. These theatres host Australian and international productions and live performances throughout the year. There are many hotels located on Collins Street, with major hotels including the Sofitel Melbourne on Collins, The Grand Hyatt Melbourne, The Westin Melbourne, Novotel Melbourne on Collins and the InterContinental Melbourne at Rialto. The Melbourne Club, a prestigious private social club established in the 19th century is located in renaissance revival style buildings designed by Leonard Terry and built in 1845. The Reserve Bank of Australia's Victorian branch is located on Collins Street. Its 1960 buildings were once the national office for the bank. Similarly, most global investment banks with a presence in Melbourne, such as Goldman Sachs and Lazard, have their headquarters located on Collins Street. The majority are located within the prestigious 101 Collins Street, contributing to the reputation that Collins Street enjoys to this day. Nauru House is notable for being the last offshore investment owned by the people of Nauru. It was sold in 2004.

History Born in Bronx, New York City, Gross was the son of Max and Sophie, who were Jewish immigrants to America. His mother was born in Ia»ôi, Romania and his father was born in Lithuania. His parents came to the United States as children around 1905. Gross' ability to draw came from his mother's artistic side of the family. His father was a CPA, which is why Gross is so well-organized. Gross attended DeWitt Clinton High School, which at the time was an all-boys school. After he graduated, Gross went to City College. He started as a business major, then he wanted to be an accounting major, and finally an advertising major. Gross ended up taking a lot of art and history courses. Sam Gross began cartooning in 1962 and has continued ever since. His cartoons have appeared in numerous magazines, including Cosmopolitan, Esquire, Good Housekeeping, Harvard Business Review and The New Yorker. He was cartoon editor for National Lampoon and Parents Magazine. Gross also became involved in electronic publishing ventures with cartoons playing an important role. Work habits Every Wednesday Gross sits down to draw and, what he calls, \\"trip\\". He claims that he does not draw for magazines or newspapers, he just draws. Gross averages 16‚Äì17 drawings a week, and numbers and dates every one.

The suite contains an agent portal, admin dashboard and customer portal. In the agent portal, teams process tickets and requests from customers (internal or external). There are various ways in which this information, as well as customer and related data can be viewed. As the name implies, the admin dashboard allows system administrators to manage the system: Options are many, but include roles and groups, process automation, channel integration, and CMDB/database options. The third component, the customer portal, is much like a customizable webpage where information can be shared with customers and requests can be tracked on the customer side.  History  In 2001, OTRS began as an open source help desk ticketing software. In 2003, OTRS GmbH was formed and a professional company entered the EMEA market. This was followed in 2006 by entry into the North American market. In 2007, the company was renamed to OTRS AG with the intention of going public, which it did in 2009. This is the same year in which OTRS was brought to Latin America with the Mexican subsidiary officially being founded in 2010. Entry into the APAC region occurred in 2011. In 2015, a new version of the software, known as OTRS Business Solution, was launched. This commercial version was designed for professional users who needed additional support, configuration and features. Also in 2015, STORM powered by OTRS was launched. In 2018, both OTRS-specific products were renamed: Names remain the same today. The open source solution became ((OTRS)) Community Edition. The commercial version is simply named OTRS and is available as managed solution. A third offering is called OTRS On- Premise: As the name implies, this is for professional customers who intend to host the platform in their own data centers.  OTRS Group  OTRS GmbH was originally founded in 2003 by Andr√© Mindermann (CEO) and Burchard Steinbild (Chairman of the Supervisory Board). In 2007, the company became OTRS Group, also known as OTRS AG. In addition to the two, today's management board includes Christopher Kuhn (COO), Sabine Riedel (Board Member, Marketing, HR), Gabriele Brauer (VP Finance) and Manuel Hecht (VP Global Software Development). OTRS AG is the source code owner of OTRS. The OTRS Group has its headquarters in Germany. There are six subsidiaries worldwide, including OTRS Inc. (USA), OTRS S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), OTRS ASIA Pte. Ltd. (Singapore), OTRS Asia Ltd. (Hong Kong), (Brazil), and OTRS Magyarorsz√°g Kft. (Hungary). OTRS AG is listed in the Basic Board of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.  Additional OTRS-related products  OTRS is very often used independently, but it is also the foundation of two other products. STORM powered by OTRS is a SOAR that is used by CERTS, SOCs and PSIRTS. It uses the OTRS service management suite as its backbone, but incorporates security-relevant processes and information. CONTROL powered by OTRS is an ISMS. It configures OTRS in such a way that it can track and document ISO 27001 controls for compliance teams.  Technical notes  Since its beginnings OTRS has been implemented in the programming language Perl. The web interface is made user-friendly by using JavaScript (which can be switched off for security reasons). The OTRS web interface uses the Template::Toolkit rendering engine to dynamically generate the HTML output of individual frontend modules. This approach allows the underlying logic of the OTRS frontend modules (written in Perl) to remain separate from the presentation of each module's user interface (served as HTML to the user). Originally, OTRS supported only the use of a MySQL RDBMS for use as the webserver database. Support has since been added for PostgreSQL, Oracle, DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, and MariaDB (a community-developed fork of MySQL). OTRS may be used on many UNIX or UNIX-like platforms (e.g. Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, etc.) as well as on Microsoft Windows. The scalability of OTRS systems may be increased by using mod_perl for the Apache Webserver or by separating the database and web server systems, allowing a large number of simultaneously working agents and high volumes of tickets. In UNIX and UNIX-like environments OTRS can make use of system programs such as the mail transfer agent Postfix to provide email functionality but this should only be considered in limited circumstances in which the possible pitfalls are clearly understood and deemed inconsequential such as cases where there exists limited or no internal corporate email infrastructure. If possible it is always advisable to integrate OTRS with an enterprise's existing email architecture which requires close coordination and planning with the responsible IT representatives. If for some reason implementation constraints make this impossible, you must at the very least request action taken by your organization's DNS provider to configure a DNS 'A' record for the target host which validates the host as an authoritative domain server. A less desirable option, (and more likely to cause issues) would be configuring a DMARC record that allows an exception in normal conformance standards for emails sent from your server, but any far-end (receiving) email server may still bounce the incoming traffic depending on the server configuration.

Another view of the street. Acland Street cake shop window. Acland Street is a street in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda, which enjoys great popularity as a recreational area, mainly due to its many restaurants and its proximity to the entertainment areas along St Kilda beach Acland Street runs on a north-west to south-east axis between Fitzroy and Barkly Streets. It was one of the first streets laid out when St Kilda was surveyed in 1842. The north-west end of the street is largely residential, and features many fine houses from the late 19th century, some of them converted to flats or other uses, such as the Linden Gallery, and earlier, Acland Street Gallery, which was at number 18, and closed in 1990. The south-east end of the street, between Carlisle and Barkly Streets, is a commercial strip. The section of Acland Street between Barkly Street and Carlisle Street is a tram zone where route 96 terminates. History Acland Street is named for Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, who owned the schooner Lady of St Kilda between 1834 and 1840. The street was named by James Ross Lawrence, who had been master of the vessel until 1842. Lawrence was the buyer of the first block at the first sale of Crown lands in St Kilda, which took place on 7 December 1842. The block was bounded by three unmade roads, one of which he named Acland Street after Thomas Acland, who had been his employer until 1840 but who had never been to Port Phillip District. The other two roads became Fitzroy Street and The Esplanade. (A plaque at the junction of Acland and Fitzroy Streets marks the site of the block.) By the 1880s, what is now the commercial end of the street was residential, with a string of large houses in large gardens, similar to the rest of the street. As St Kilda evolved into a playground for the masses in the early 20th century, with electric tram lines running to the front of Luna Park and down this end of Acland Street, the mansions and gardens were replaced with shops in the 1920s and 30s. By the 1930s these shops had become of the centres of Melbourne's Jewish community, which grew greatly in size with European refugees before and after World War II, and Acland Street featured a number of shops and restaurants catering to this community. In the 1968, the Balberyszski bookshop moved into Acland Street, staying on till the 1990s. The Scheherezade cafe, established in 1958,ST. KILDA: THE SHOW GOES ON: THE HISTORY OF ST. KILDA, VOL. III, 1930 TO JULY 1983, ANNE LONGMIRE was the most representative and popular part of this heritage, and served up borscht and latkes for decades. A number of cake shops specialising in Central and East European fare such as Kugelhopf and Black Forest Cake were also established in this period. By the 1980s, the centre of Jewish Melbourne had moved eastwards to more affluent Caulfield, and Acland street became less European and more for weekend tourists, until finally Scheherazade moved to Caulfield in 2008. The remaining cake shops of Acland Street are a reminder of this community, though most no longer run by Jewish owners.

Near the junction of Carlisle Street and Acland Street is Luna Park, one of Australia's best- known amusement parks, which attracts large crowds during the summer. Almost next door is one of Melbourne's grandest theatres, the Palais Theatre. Also on Acland Street is the St Kilda Army and Navy Club, built in 1923 with a hall on the first floor, a cinema to the rear, and flats for retired service personnel on top. Today Acland Street has many restaurants offering a variety of cuisines, including Vietnamese, Indian, Italian and Malaysian.

Records. The album consists mostly of songs written and arranged by Parks, with Wilson featured as lead and backing vocalist. Its title refers to the sun-drenched, idealized paintings that grace wooden fruit crates, and its theme is a nostalgic view of the history of California. Background In the thirty years following their collaboration on the ill-fated Beach Boys' Smile project, Wilson and Parks had each developed their own solo careers. Sometime in 1992, Parks approached a then-reclusive Wilson with the invitation to record an album together. Wilson was in the middle of a court-ordered removal and restraining order from his psychiatrist, which came as a result of years of over-medication and gross misconduct. According to Parks, \\"The reason why I asked him was to take care of this unfinished business, and to try to escape from the tyranny of the sense of history that's been placed on our own aborted effort. [Smile]\\" Later adding, \\"When I found him, he was alone in a room staring at a television. It was off.\\" It is reported that Wilson interrupted the first vocal session for the album by asking Parks, \\"Wait a minute. What am I even doing here?\\" Parks hit the talk button and responded, \\"You‚Äôre here because I can‚Äôt stand the sound of my own voice!\\" Wilson paused, nodded his head, and stepped up to the microphone proclaiming, \\"Well, that makes sense! Okay, take one!\\" Though billed and anticipated as a full collaboration, the album is devoted to Parks' compositions, and features his typical dense wordplay and orchestrations. Wilson for his part contributes only the vocals and vocal arrangements. Parks also reported that despite his invitation, Wilson had declined to contribute any music to the project. Despite this, he was impassioned to record the album for Parks, determined to make something that he \\"could live with\\" ten years from then.http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/audio-van-dyke-parks- part-3-1993 Barney Hoskyns, Rock's Backpages Audio, 16 June 1993 Reception Given the history of its artists, the album came with high expectations, but upon release it received mixed critical reviews and had lackluster sales, failing even to chart. Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic wrote, \\"Van Dyke Parks' approach is intellectual, not instinctual, which means his compositions are over-labored and overwrought. Instead of making his melodies catchy, Parks makes sure they are complex, which means they are rarely memorable. Similarly, his lyrics are dense and laden with poetic imagery and metaphors, yet they are entirely too cerebral for a pop album. Then again, Orange Crate Art isn't a pop album -- it's a self-conscious work of art.\\" Parks has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the album's reception, saying \\"It took three years and $350,000.

When taken within one to two days of developing symptoms, rimantadine can shorten the duration and moderate the severity of influenza. Both rimantadine and the similar drug amantadine are derivates of adamantane. Rimantadine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994. Rimantadine was approved for medical use in 1993. 100% of seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples tested have shown resistance to rimantadine and it is no longer recommended to prescribe for treatment of the flu.Antiviral Agents for the Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Medical use Rimantadine is believed to inhibit influenza's viral replication, possibly by preventing the uncoating of the virus's protective shells, which are the envelope and capsid. Genetic studies suggest that the virus M2 protein, an ion channel specified by virion M2 gene, plays an important role in the susceptibility of influenza A virus to inhibition by rimantadine. Resistance to rimantadine can occur as a result of amino acid substitutions at certain locations in the transmembrane region of M2. This prevents binding of the antiviral to the channel. Rimantadine, like its antiviral cousin amantadine, possesses some NMDA antagonistic properties and is used as an antiparkinsonic drug (i.e., in the treatment of Parkinson's disease). However, in general, neither rimantadine nor amantadine is a preferred agent for this therapy and would be reserved for cases of the disease that are less responsive to front-line treatments. Drug interactions Taking paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol) or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) while taking rimantadine is known to reduce the body's uptake of rimantadine by approximately 12%. Cimetidine also affects the body's uptake of rimantadine. Side effects Rimantadine can produce gastrointestinal and central nervous system adverse effects. Approximately 6% of patients (compared to 4% of patients taking a placebo) reported side-effects at a dosage of 200 mg/d. Common side effects include: *nausea *upset stomach *nervousness *tiredness *lightheadedness *trouble sleeping *difficulty concentrating  History  Rimantadine was discovered in 1963US patent 3352912 to W.

It is home to No. 645 Volunteer Gliding Squadron flying the Grob Viking T.1 glider. Since the British Army took over a large part of the site in 1974, the airfield is now a small enclave within what is now known as Alanbrooke Barracks. History Topcliffe opened in September 1940 as a bomber station in RAF Bomber Command and was home to No. 77 Squadron and No. 102 Squadron, both flying the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley heavy bomber. There was a decoy site at Raskelf. No. 419 Squadron and No. 424 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) moved in flying Vickers Wellington bombers and later, the Handley Page Halifax III. On 1 January 1943 the station was transferred to No. 6 Group RCAF and became a training station. The station, along with sub-stations at Wombleton, Dalton and Dishforth were designated as No. 61 (Training) Base in late 1943. No.1 Air Navigation School was located at Topcliffe between March 1957 & December 1961. The Air Electronics school came in January 1962 and from 1967 became the Air Electronics & Engineers School, flying Vickers Varsity T.1 aircraft. From October 1964 the Northern Communications Squadron flew Avro Anson C.19 aircraft, replacing them with Beagle Basset CC.1 in 1965. The squadron left Topcliffe in January 1969. The Airman Aircrew Initial Training School was located at Topcliffe from January 1967 until February 1970. No. 15 Aviation Flight AAC flew de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver AL.1 aircraft from the early 1970s and No. 666 Aviation Squadron AAC flew Westland Scout AH.1 helicopters between 1973 and 1978. In 1974 much of the station was transferred to the British Army and became Alanbrooke Barracks, now home of 4th Regiment Royal Artillery. However, all flying facilities remain intact. The wartime control tower, with modifications, is still used, and the station is referred to as RAF Topcliffe by the RAF. During the eighties, Topcliffe was home of the Royal Navy Elementary Flying School. In the nineties it was temporarily home to a Shorts Tucano squadron of the RAF Central Flying School. It was the home of the Tucano Air Navigation Squadron, teaching student navigators of both the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy until April 2002 when it moved to RAF Linton-on-Ouse. During the 1990s and until 2001, the airfield was utilised by Merlin Parachute Club, home to both the 4 Para parachute display team and the University of York Sport Parachute Club. No. 635 Volunteer Gliding Squadron operated from Topcliffe from 2009 when it moved from its former home at RAF Samlesbury. The unit disbanded in 2016 as part of the relaunch of air cadet aviation.

It is a pink mechanical toy rabbit wearing sunglasses and blue and black striped flip-flops that beats a bass drum bearing the Energizer logo. History The Energizer Bunny was first created as a parody of the Duracell Bunny, which first appeared in television advertising in 1973, in its \\"Drumming Bunny\\" commercial. Duracell had purportedly trademarked the drumming bunny character, but whether they had or not, said trademark had lapsed by 1988, providing Energizer an opening to create their own trademark. The first Energizer Bunny commercial was broadcast on United States television on . Produced by DDB Needham Worldwide, the spot began as a direct parody of Duracell's \\"Drumming Bunny\\" ad. In the original Duracell ads, a set of battery-powered drum-playing toy rabbits gradually slow to a halt until only the toy powered by a Duracell copper-top battery remains active. In Energizer's parody, the Energizer Bunny enters the screen midway through the ad, beating a huge bass drum and swinging a mallet over his head. The Energizer Bunny is promoted as being able to continue operating indefinitely, or at least much longer than similar toys (or other products) using rival brands' batteries. The criticism was that Duracell compared their batteries with carbon-zinc batteries, and not similar alkaline batteries like Energizer. The creative team at D.D.B. Chicago who conceived and designed the bunny chose All Effects special effects company to build the original Energizer Bunny, a remote-controlled prop. All Effects operated the Energizer Bunny in most of its first commercials. Commercials after the first started out with the Bunny leaving the studio it performed the \\"Drumming Bunny\\" ad in, then wandering into the sets of a couple of realistic-looking commercials for fictional products, interrupting them. As the campaign progressed, many of these ads were standalone (for fake products such as \\"Sitagin Hemorrhoid Remedy\\", \\"Nasotine Sinus Relief\\", \\"TresCafe Coffee\\", \\"Alarm\\" deodorant soap, etc.) and even a few featured celebrities (such as Lyle Alzado promoting a snack called \\"Pigskins\\", and Ted Nugent doing an ad for a Mexican food chain called \\"Cucaracha\\") only to have the Bunny march through, beating his drum, because he was \\"still going\\" (one infamous commercial was for a fake long-distance telephone company with a couple in the United Kingdom talking to their son, who was supposedly in New York and exclaimed that he \\"sounded like he's right next door\\", and when the Bunny came in, he knocked down the divider to show they really were next to each other). Eventually real-life products and icons would do a crossover with the Energizer Bunny (Michael J. Fox doing a Pepsi ad, and the opening of TV shows such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents and ABC's Wide World of Sports). The Energizer Bunny has appeared in more than 115 television commercials.History of the Energizer Bunny Energizer.com - Retrieved: July 5, 2007 In these commercials, a voice-over would announce one of various slogans used throughout the years; all of them would relate the stalwartness of the Energizer Bunny to the long-lasting power of their batteries. The original slogan boasted that \\"...[n]othing outlasts the Energizer...\\", but it was eventually changed after a lawsuit filed by Duracell disputing Energizer's claim.Pott, Carol (Ed.), (2005). The Blue Pages: A Directory of Companies Rated by Their Politics and Practices. Polipoint Press, (heading under Energizer Holdings, Inc.) Those commercials with the bunny interrupting all the action in a commercial were eventually spoofed in the 1993 film Hot Shots! Part Deux, featuring a blue animal drumming through instead of the pink bunny. The two people fighting then use their guns to shoot the animal, which explodes. =1990s= In the 1990s advertisements featuring the Energizer Bunny were made by a variety of companies, including Industrial Light & Magic, Cafe FX and Method Studios. Eric Allard's All Effects Company however did the bulk of the live action Energizer Bunny building, maintanance and puppeteering with ILM taking over for later commercials.https://web.archive.org/web/20100606045502/http://www.donbies.com/photogallery/enrg/energizer.htm From 1993 to 1995, Energizer ran a series of commercials featuring a fake rival battery called \\"Supervolt\\" including a Supervolt weasel mascot, which was an obvious lookalike of Duracell. As Supervolt's battery sales had fallen, the company's CEO (portrayed by Rip Torn) sought to neutralize the Energizer Bunny by targeting its battery. Supervolt's CEO sought out people who could help him. * The first ad starred a Blofeld-like evil genius who planned to use the Matter Disintegrator to destroy the battery. It shut down when the Supervolt batteries in it ran out. * The second ad starred King Kong where Supervolt's CEO gave him a reward card (for bananas). When cornering the Energizer Bunny on the Empire State Building, a woman who King Kong angered slammed the door on his foot, causing him to fall off the Empire State Building. In many of the associated commercials that followed, villains such as Darth Vader, the Wicked Witch of the West, Wile E. Coyote, and Boris and Natasha, as well as a robotic flea, would try to destroy or capture the Bunny only to see complications arise when their devices using Supervolt batteries ran out or other circumstances allowed for the bunny's escape. In addition, a flock of vultures and a foxhunt would get exhausted trying to catch the Energizer Bunny and the Grim Reaper gave up waiting for the Energizer Bunny to come with him. The \\"Blofeld\\" ad showed the quality of the product being advertised when it created complications for the villain - so as not to imply that Energizer was better than any other brand, as well as to encourage people to buy Energizer batteries for their smoke detectors. =2016= In September 2016, Energizer switched their advertising agency to Camp+King and introduced a new more expressive bunny who is slimmer and has more facial expression. The bunny will keep the signature drum, flip flops, and dark sunglasses, but the pink fur will be more realistic. Campaign success Despite the immense popularity of the campaign, sales of Energizer batteries actually went down during the years that the ads ran. Duracell claimed that 40 percent of its customers thought the campaign was promoting Duracell, not Energizer, but provided no evidence. Speculation has it that TV watchers still associated pink bunnies with Duracell, so the Energizer ads were actually helping their competitor's sales rather than their own.Those Creative Tv Ads Can Be A Commercial Failure http://articles.philly.com/1997-11-25/news/25542942_1_tv- ads-new-ad-agency-duracell In popular culture In North America the term \\"Energizer Bunny\\" has entered the vernacular as a term for anything that continues endlessly, or someone that has immense stamina. In Europe and Australia the term \\"Duracell Bunny\\" has a similar connotation. Several U.S. presidential candidates have compared themselves to the bunny, including President George H. W. Bush in 1992 and Howard Dean in 2004. In 1992, the company PC Dynamics created a Screen Saver for Windows 3.x featuring Energizer Bunny with audio clips from the commercials. During the ninth season of Roseanne (1996‚Äì97), the lyrics sung by Blues Traveler lead singer John Popper begin with: \\"If what doesn't kill us is making us stronger, we're gonna last longer/Than that greatest wall in China, or that rabbit with the drum.\\" Energizer was the corporate sponsor of Star Tours at Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios for several years; the bunny appeared in several ride-themed advertisements around the show's exit. In 2006, an Energizer Bunny balloonicle debuted in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and appeared until 2011. For several years, comedian and ventriloquist Jeff Dunham had a recurring joke about the Energizer Bunny. His \\"grumpy old man\\" puppet Walter would ask about commercials interrupting their broadcast, citing the Bunny as a particularly annoying example. The joke would often end with Walter saying, \\"I'd like to trap his furry little ass...hook him up to a Sears DieHard.\\" In the MAD sketch HOPS, E.B fooled the cop into catching the Energizer Bunny. Legal challenges = 1990 Duracell trademark dispute = When Energizer's 1988 parody became an advertising success and Energizer trademarked its bunny, Duracell decided to revive the Duracell Bunny campaign and filed for a new United States trademark of its own, citing the original use of the character more than a decade earlier. The resulting dispute resulted in a confidential out of court settlement, where Energizer (and its bunny) took exclusive trademark rights in the United States and Canada, and Duracell (and its bunny) took exclusive rights in all other places in the world. = 1991 Adolph Coors lawsuit = In 1991, Energizer Holdings unsuccessfully sued the Adolph Coors Company for copyright infringement for creating a parody of its Energizer bunny ads.Eveready Battery Co., Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., 765 F. Supp. 440 (N.D. Ill. 1991) The advertisement had comedian Leslie Nielsen banging a bass drum while wearing rabbit ears while the announcer said \\"It keeps growing and growing!\\" The court eventually sided with Coors noting the obvious facts that the content of the ad is substantially different considering Nielsen was not a toy and he did not run on batteries. = 2016 Duracell distribution lawsuit = In February 2016, Energizer filed a trademark infringement and contract violation lawsuit against Duracell. Energizer alleged that Duracell was using a pink bunny in its advertising in the United States, did not have any trademark rights in the United States in a pink bunny, and had violated an agreement between Energizer and Duracell governing the use of a pink bunny trademark in the U.S. Duracell replied that the cases Energizer cited came from overseas distributors importing packages from abroad, and that Duracell did not have the specific power to stop those distributors from doing so. In November 2017, a United States District court judge threw out most of Energizer's claims in a summary judgement, but leaving the breach of the 1992 territorial contract dispute active with respect to the two companies' bunny trademarks.

The border town is situated on a little promontory facing Hendaye (France) over the Txingudi bay. A service boat makes the trip between the two cities. The town holds an ancient old quarter with walls and a castle. In addition, Hondarribia features a beach across the Bidasoa from the touristy housing estate Sokoburu in Hendaye, alongside a mountain called Jaizkibel providing a hilly backdrop to the town. A road leads north-east from the beach area to the Cape Higuer, located in this municipality. The town harbours the San Sebastian Airport, which serves domestic flights. The population as of 2005 is 15,700 inhabitants. Battles The battles fought for possession of this fortified stronghold are generally known by the Spanish name for the place (Fuenterrab√≠a). *Battle of Fuenterrab√≠a (1521), in which Claude, Duke of Guise distinguished himself, was instigated by Guillaume Gouffier, seigneur de Bonnivet, in command of the army of Navarre; he occupied the stronghold after the renewal of hostilities. The city was finally reoccupied by Charles V's forces in 1524 after the first Siege of Fuenterrab√≠a. *Siege of Fuenterrab√≠a (1638) was the outcome of a siege by the invading forces of Louis XIII, led by Cond√©. 27,000 French soldiers besieged the city for two months, firing 16,000 shells into the walled city, leaving only 300 survivors, most of them women and children. The city was virtually destroyed, but nevertheless did not surrender.Tuwien.ac.at The Spanish soldiers were successful, and the raising of the siege is celebrated annually on 8 September in a parade, known as Alarde. *Battle of Fuenterrab√≠a (1719), during the War of the Quadruple Alliance. *Battle of Fuenterrab√≠a (1794), in which the French Revolutionary Army took the city by breaching the walls. After they took over the city, they blew up with the help of German engineers the section of wall facing France. The signing of the Peace of Basel took place before all the wall was destroyed. Sports The women's basketball team Hondarribia-Irun and the rowing club Hondarribia Arraun Elkartea are the two most prestigious sports clubs in the town. In the last decade, the judo club Ama Guadalupekoa has had a lot of national medals in this discipline. The Hondarribia-Irun plays in the Spanish women's basketball league since 2003, and it has competed against European teams several times. Hondarribia has a rowing team called Hondarribia Arraun Elkartea, and its boat is characterized by its green color and its name, ‚ÄúAma Guadalupekoa‚Äù. In 2005 it won ‚ÄúLa Bandera de la Concha‚Äù, one of the most prestigious competitions for Basque rowers. Furthermore, the Vilari√±o family, which is fully linked to the world of the engine, continues to achieve success at national and European levels. Hondarribia has its own golf course where Jose Maria Olazabal, one of the best golf players in the world, was raised, and marina, where the Olympic medalist Iker Martinez took his first boat roads. Leisure Center of interpretation of the walls of Hondarribia (Arma Plaza Fundazioa). * The construction of a jetty and other ancillary works by the engineer Iribarren, created the beach (hondartza) of Hondarribia that provides a place to enjoy the waters of the bay. In the late twentieth century the beach was partially modified, building on its surroundings a recreational port and a sports center. * Throughout the year, but especially in the summer months, Arma Plaza Fundazioa (municipal foundation) organizes guided visits to the old town, the port-quarter of the Marina and the Fort of Guadalupe. * The tourist office also managed by Arma Plaza Fundazioa, located in the Plaza de Armas, incorporates an interpretation center with spaces for audiovisual presentations / temporary exhibitions and souvenirs of the city.

Karl Anton Freiherr von Martini and Franz von Zeiller were the leading drafters at the earlier and later stages of the draft. Comparable to the Napoleonic code, it was based on the ideals of freedom and equality before the law. It was divided into three major segments, following the Roman law segregation methods.

A form of mead, it is made from the fermentation of honey in water. Chouchen normally contains 14% alcohol by volume. Traditionally, buckwheat honey is used, and this imparts chouchen's strong colour and pronounced flavour.Philippe Marchenay and Laurence B√©rard. L'homme, l'abeille et le miel, Editions de Bor√©e, 2007, , p.202 Tuesday, August 18, 2020 In Brittany, the fermentation process is begun by the addition of freshly pressed apple juice. Yeasts can also be used, as in the beer-making process. To reach the required alcoholic strength, for a litre of chouchen, approximately a third of a litre of honey is needed. Chouchen is drunk chilled (though without ice), and generally as an aperitif. It can also be added to melon, in a similar way to port wine, or as a hot wine in the winter. There are different kinds of chouchen in Brittany, some of which are prepared with a mixture of seawater as well as fresh water and honey. Originally chouchen was made of cider and honey. The historical reputation of chouchen as a powerful intoxicant arises partly from claims that its effects were boosted by the venom of bees that became mixed up in the brew. While this claim cannot be verified, bees and their venom are not ingredients of the modern product. But, since in ancient times, it was the entire honey comb that was dipped in the cider, it is very possible that a few bees or discarded stingers remained stuck in the mixture and, aided by the fermentation, would see the potency of their venom magnified . There is another drink similar to chouchen, called chufere, which is made of honey and cider. It is generally of a lower strength in alcohol than chouchen, typically eight to nine percent alcohol by volume, and has become less popular and less common than chouchen.

She was manned by a crew from sloop of war which had been laid up at Baltimore because of the British blockade of Chesapeake Bay. Comdr. Charles G. Ridgeley was her captain. Most of the guns for the new American ships had not reached Sackett's Harbor by 19 May when the British fleet arrived off the American base and began a strict blockade. Jefferson finally sailed with Chauncey's fleet on 31 July and arrived off Niagara on 5 August. With and she blockaded several English vessels inside the river while Chauncey with the rest of the fleet sailed on to Kingston to challenge the main English squadron. After remaining on blockade duty off Niagara for over a month, Jefferson sailed for Kingston to rejoin Chauncey. During the passage, on 12 September, a severe storm arose, which before abating three days later, almost swamped the brig. Ten of her guns were thrown overboard in the struggle to save the ship. Jefferson rejoined her fleet on 17 September and operated with it during the remainder of the navigation season attempting to draw Sir James Yeo's ships into a decisive contest. Toward the end of November she was laid up for the winter. Peace obviated Jefferson's planned return to commission in the spring. She apparently remained in ordinary until sold on 30 April 1825.

The village is situated at the intersection of the A19 and the A645, approximately east of Pontefract and south-west of Selby. It is also located close to the M62. Primary age children attend Whitley and Eggborough Primary School which lies in Learning Lane on the other side of the M62. History Eggborough (as well as High and Low Eggborough) is mentioned in the Domesday Book and was formerly in the Wapentake of Osgoldcross. The name derives from Ecga's Burh; a fortification which belonged to a person named Ecga. It was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. Eggborough Grain Mill There is a pub in the village; the Horse and Jockey. There is also a sports and leisure complex based in the grounds of the nearby Eggborough Power Station. The sports and leisure complex offers a nine-hole golf course, two miniature football pitches, two full size football pitches, a bowling green, a children's play area, a miniature railway, a licensed bar, snooker, pool, a green room and a concert hall. The Spar shop, which is located next to the Horse and Jockey, was previously owned by Claire Smith until it‚Äôs sale in 2019 to Mr B Kular; when it became a Londis.Companies house The centre of the village used to be the location of a Bowman's Flour Mill, but this ceased production in 2016. Close to Eggborough is the site of French-owned Saint-Gobain Glass, Europe's leading producer of float (flat) glass. The plant, which opened in 1998, employs over 170 people and produces of flat glass per year. The large village hall on Selby Road is well used by residents and it is a shared facility with the residents of Whitley Bridge who have no village hall of their own. Other activities take place at the Methodist Hall and the Westfield Centre. Although the village is situated within the boundaries of North Yorkshire, the postal address for Eggborough is \\"Eggborough, Near Goole, East Yorkshire\\". It has a DN (Doncaster, South Yorkshire) postcode and the STD telephone code is 01977 (Pontefract, West Yorkshire). Eggborough Eagles Football Club The village also has its own football team called Eggborough Eagles, which is based at the Eggborough Sports and Leisure Complex. The Eggborough Eagles was founded in 2011 by Chairman James Lancaster, Secretary Michael Corr and Manager Michael Shaughnessy. They came 4th in their first ever season recognised in the Selby and District Invitational League. =Power stations= Eggborough Power Station The village is the site of the coal-fired Eggborough Power Station, built in the 1960s and once owned by British Energy. Its 4 turbines could produce a total combined output of 1960 MWe. The power station was due to be closed in 2016, but won a reprieve as a back up generator of power until March 2017 and then again until March 2018, when it shut down for good. The current owners are applying for permission to convert the power station to a gas-fired power plant. There was also a short lived biomass power station, ARBRE Power Station, built by the Kelda Group, owners of Yorkshire Water, which cost ¬£30 million. The site was developed to burn willow wood grown by local farmers and turn it into gas, however, by August 2002 had gone into liquidation. The capacity of the station was rated at 8 MW. In 2015, DRENL (UK) gained approval to convert the old ARBRE site into an Energy from waste (EfW) plant that would process of waste per year to generate 10 MW of electricity. Transport The A19 and the A645 intersect in the village with the A19 being on a north/south axis and having a junction (number 34) on the M62 just south of the village. To the south of the village lies the Aire and Calder Navigation. Eggborough is served by railway station on the Pontefract line, but services are limited to just two trains a day to and only one through to . Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches north to West Haddlesey with a total population of 3,763. It has a parish council consisting of four members.

Biography Martin Conner was born in Forrest County, MS in August 1891. In 1900 his family moved to rural Seminary in Covington County in southern Mississippi, where Conner likely obtained his high school education at the Seminary Attendance Center (now Seminary High School). Conner began his education at the University of Mississippi in Oxford at the age of 14 yr, likely the youngest person to attend the university along with Enoch Starnes. He continued his education at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, after which he began a legal career in Seminary and served as a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1916 to 1924, including a stint as Speaker. His term as a governor corresponded with the Great Depression, but he maintained a state treasury surplus during his tenure. He was noted for going to the state penitentiary to preside over \\"mercy courts\\" that resulted in executive clemency for prisoners.. One of Conner's methods by which he orchestrated a positive $16 million swing in the state's finances (in only 4 years) was the introduction of a state sales tax. Conner was allied with Huey Pierce Long, Jr., the governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932 and the U.S. senator from 1932 to 1935. Long struck up an alliance with Conner to support \\"good roods\\" connecting the neighboring states. From the sidelines, Long helped Conner win the Mississippi governorship though Conner had twice lost previous bid for the office. Conner's runoff election opponent and gubernatorial successor, Hugh L. White, tried to make an issue of Long's involvement in an out-of-state race.Huey Pierce Long, Jr., Every Man a King: The Autobiography of Huey P. Long (New Orleans: National Book Club, Inc., 1933), pp. 275-276..

He won the Prix de Rome in 1883, one year before Claude Debussy. On 8 January 1886, in Rome, Vidal and Debussy performed Franz Liszt's Faust Symphony at two pianos for Liszt himself, an after-dinner performance that Liszt apparently slept through. The following day they played Emmanuel Chabrier's Trois valses romantiques for Liszt.

In collaboration with Andr√© Messager, he also orchestrated piano music of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin into a Suite de danses (1913). He is perhaps better known today through his keyboard harmony exercises, Basses et Chantes Donn√©es which was a favorite teaching tool of his pupil, the legendary pedagogue Nadia Boulanger, and subsequently many of her students including Narcis Bonet who has republished a selection of these exercises under the title Paul Vidal, Nadia Boulanger: A Collection of Given Basses and Melodies\\".

He was educated at Sherborne School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War Two. Joining the Royal Artillery, he was captured in the Battle of Crete and spent four years as a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany. Returning to university, he obtained an engineering degree, followed by a job with the glass manufacturers Pilkington Brothers. He was not related to the Pilkington family which then controlled the business. Business career In 1952 Pilkington invented the float glass process, in which molten glass was \\"floated\\" over a bath of molten tin and manipulated to achieve the required product thickness, and with his associate Kenneth Bickerstaff, ‚Äì Manufacture of float glass, issued 10 November 1959 spent seven years perfecting and patenting its commercially successful manufacture. American inventors had tried several times to achieve an improved and lower-cost process to replace the costly plate glass, but had not succeeded. His breakthrough enabled Pilkingtons to dominate the world market for high quality flat glass for many years. Starting in the early 1960s, all the world's leading flat glass manufacturers obtained licences to use the float glass process.

Structure & operation A TMO is created when residents (tenants and leaseholders) in a defined area of council or housing association homes create a corporate body and, typically, elect a management committee to run the body. This body then enters into a formal legal contract between the landlord of the home(s) and the council, known as the management agreement. This agreement outlines the services a TMO is responsible for and what services the council is responsible for. The services provided by TMOs are mainly funded by the management fees paid by the Council under the agreement. The management agreement details precisely which services are managed by the TMO on behalf of the landlord. The extent of the devolution in service can vary enormously, particularly between small and large TMOs, but may typically include day-to-day repairs, allocations and lettings, tenancy management, cleaning and care taking and rent collection/recovery. The TMO can take a number of legal forms. Registered TMOs may be a co-operative, or set up under corporate law. Some 'guide TMOs' provide support to community groups interested in the concept (Friday Hill TMO and Millbank Estate TMO are two examples in London).

It is not the same as the history of feminism, which outlines the origins and evolution of the feminist movement. It also differs from women's history, which focuses on the role of women in historical events. The goal of feminist history is to explore and illuminate the female viewpoint of history through rediscovery of female writers, artists, philosophers, etc., in order to recover and demonstrate the significance of women's voices and choices in the past.Cain, William E., ed.

History and Theory: Feminist Research, Debates, Contestations (University of Chicago Press, 1997)Lerner, Gerda, The Majority Finds Its Past: Placing Women in History (Oxford University Press, 1981) Feminist History seeks to change the nature of history to include gender into all aspects of historical analysis, while also looking through a critical feminist lens. Jill Matthews states ‚Äúthe purpose of that change is political: to challenge the practices of the historical discipline that have belittled and oppressed women, and to create practices that allow women an autonomy and space for self-definition‚Äù Two particular problems which feminist history attempts to address are the exclusion of women from the historical and philosophical tradition, and the negative characterization of women or the feminine therein; however, feminist history is not solely concerned with issues of gender per se, but rather with the reinterpretation of history in a more holistic and balanced manner. > \\"If we take feminism to be that cast of mind that insists that the > differences and inequalities between the sexes are the result of historical > processes and are not blindly \\"natural,\\" we can understand why feminist > history has always had a dual mission‚Äîon the one hand to recover the lives, > experiences, and mentalities of women from the condescension and obscurity > in which they have been so unnaturally placed, and on the other to reexamine > and rewrite the entire historical narrative to reveal the construction and > workings of gender.\\" ‚ÄîSusan Pedersen The \\"disappearing woman\\" has been a focus of attention of academic feminist scholarship.

Women of ideas - and what men have done to them from Aphra Behn to Adrienne Rich. Routledge & Kegan Paul. London 1982 Understanding feminist history Feminist history combines the search for past female scholars with a modern feminist perspective on how history is affected by them. While many mistake it as women's history, feminist history does not solely focus on the retelling of history from a woman's perspective. Rather, it is interpreting history with a feminist frame of mind. It is also not to be confused with the history of feminism, which recounts the history of the feminist movements. Feminist historians, instead, include ‚Äúcultural and social investigations‚Äù in the job description. Feminist history came into being as women began writing accounts of their own and other women's lives. A few of these, such as Susan B. Anthony and Audre Lorde, documented histories of their feminist movements. Feminist historians collect to analyze and analyze to connect. Rather than just recording women's history, they allow a connection to be made with ‚Äúpublic history.\\" However, problems remain in integrating this improved history into a curriculum appropriate for students. Finally, feminist historians must now be able to understand the digital humanities involved in creating an online database of their primary sources as well as published works done by notable feminist historians. Feminist digital humanists work with feminist historians to reveal an online integration of the two histories. Harvard's Women‚Äôs Studies Database contain sources, like the Gerritsen Collection, that allow scholarly papers by feminists to be written and publicly convey the fact that there is more than one history and the progress made in combining them. Relations to women's history Feminist historians use women's history to explore the different voices of past women. This gathering of information requires the help of experts who have dedicated their lives to this pursuit. It provides historians with primary sources that are vital to the integration of histories. Firsthand accounts, like Fiedler's And the Walls Come Tumbling Down? (A Feminist View from East Berlin) recounts the daily lives of past women. It documents how their lives were affected by the laws of their government. Women's historians go on to interpret how the laws changed these women's lives, but feminist historians rely on this information to observe the ‚Äòdisappearing woman‚Äô. Fieldler even mentioned that ‚Äú[t]hese feminists were disappointed when they meant ordinary eastern women who were good housewives too, while enjoying outside work.\\" Because these feminists only knew the public history of the German Democratic Republic, they projected themselves into the imaginary. Upon investigation of eastern women's lives, they found that though the GDR's socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, there had been no women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a public history in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler's, has allowed women's historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to compare them to scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period isn't too difficult, but the challenge is in knowing how to combine what they learned from the source with what they know from the works. Integrating histories Feminist historians see mainly two specific histories. The first is the public, singular history. It is composed of political events and newspapers. The second is made up of women's history and analyzed primary sources. The integration of these two histories helps historians to look at the past with a more feminist lens, the way feminist historians do. Professor Peter G. Filene of the University of North Carolina recounted in his paper Integrating Women's History and Regular History that ‚Äú[his] purpose is to help students understand the values and behavior of people who are unlike themselves. Through history we enter other lives, analyze the forces that shaped those lives, and ultimately understand patterns of culture.\\" In fact, when Filene was asked to teach a course on the history of American women, the revelations of past women allowed him to recognize that he wasn't learning heroine history, or herstory, but a compensatory history. However, this thought limited his studies. He found himself thinking of women's contributions to what men had already written down. Rather than having the histories of the ‚Äòpublic‚Äô and the ‚Äòdomestic‚Äô sphere, one should know that this line between the two is imaginary. Though not all women are politicians or war generals, boys are raised in the domestic sphere. Not only that, but men come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say ‚Äú[n]o man can be a good citizen who is not a good husband and a good father.‚Äù Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men's history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women's history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men's and women's history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.  Feminist historiography  Feminist historiography is another notable facet of feminist history. One important feminist historiography writer and researcher is Judith M. Bennett. In her book, History Matters: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism, Bennett writes on the importance of studying a ‚Äúpatriarchal equilibrium‚Äù. Cheryl Glenn also writes on the importance of feminist historiography ‚ÄúWriting women (or any other traditionally disenfranchised group) into the history of rhetoric, then, can be an ethically and intellectually responsible gesture that disrupts those frozen memories in order to address silences, challenge absences, and assert women's contributions to public life‚Äù This facet of feminist history inspect historical writings that are typically assumed to be canon, and reinvents them under a feminist lens.

The term \\"Rozvi\\" refers to their legacy as a warrior nation, taken from the Shona term Kurozva or to plunder. History In 1683, Portuguese militia tried to take control of the gold trade in the interior of Africa by invading the Rozvi empire. The Rozvi, armed with the traditional spears and shields, were able to successfully defeat these attacks and maintain their control of the gold mines until their empire collapsed. The Rozvi were led by Changamire Dombo, and his son Kambgun DomboIsichei, Elizabeth Allo, A History of African Societies to 1870 Cambridge University Press, 1997, page 435 whose power was based in Butua in the southwest of Africa. The Rozvi were formed from several Shona states that dominated the plateau of present-day Zimbabwe at the time. They drove the Portuguese off the central plateau, and the Europeans retained only a nominal presence at one of the fair-towns in the eastern highlands. Changamire brought the whole of present-day Zimbabwe under his control, forming a polity that became known as the Rozvi Empire. This powerful kingdom of warriors was to be known as the Rozvi or baLozwi people. They established their capital at Danangombe, also known as Dhlo-Dhlo (the Ndebele name). Many sources see the Rozvi not as a recovering segment of the Mutapa people, but in fact a people in its own right emerging under the wing of the Mutapa (compare the rise of the Khumalo from under the Zulu nation). The administrative power of the Mutapa began to fail in its control of the whole empire, and tributaries began to exert more independence. A leader of the people of Guruuswa, given the title Changamire and known as Dombo, became independent from the Mutapa. When the Portuguese tried to colonize them, Changamire Dombo led rebellions against their rule. The area of the Rozvi Empire fluctuated. Its influence extended over much of present-day Zimbabwe, westward into Botswana, and southward into northeastern South Africa. The Rozvi leader Changamire Dombo was originally a herdsmen in the Mutapa state, yet managed to drive away the Portuguese, earning himself support and followers, thereby enabling him to break away from the legendary Mutapa empire. Changamire Dombo, according to oral tradition, is believed to have possessed supernatural powers. He was said to be able to turn a white cow into a red one, and more. His magical ability made him feared by people and earned him respect and even more followers. The name Changamire became the honour name of all the kings who followed after him. The Rozvi's political system was hierarchical. Kingship followed a male line and the king was the highest political, religious, military, economic, judicial and social authority, as well as the main distributor of land. The King was helped to rule by an advisory council made up of state officials appointed by him; this consisted of his most senior wives, the crown prince, the tumbare (regent), religious leaders, military commanders and also vassal chiefs. The Rozvi Empire eventually became the most powerful empire in present-day Zimbabwe. Many tales identify Dombo ('Rock') as Chikura Wadyembeu. Modern scholars agree that this is confusion with another leader of a different people. Rulers of Rozvi State included Chirisa Mhuru and Chikuyo Chisamarenga. Technology and economy The Rozvi kings revived the tradition of building in stone and constructed impressive cities, now known as 'zimbabwes', throughout the southwest. Polychrome pottery was also emblematic of its culture. The Rozvi empire had many economic branches but agriculture was its backbone. They planted crops such as sorghum and millet and the state depended heavily on subsistence farming. Livestock was also another important agricultural branch. They kept animals such as sheep, goats, cattle and chickens; those with many livestock were considered rich and were accorded very high economic status within the society. Trade was another important economic activity and the Rozvi practiced both internal and external trade. From foreign traders they obtained imported goods such as guns, salt, beads and sea shells; in return they bartered ivory, copper and gold. Mining was another major branch and was done by males. The warriors were armed with spears, shields, bows and arrows when they raided others or defended their state. Its warriors were known to be violent; this earned them the name rozvi, meaning plunders or destroyers. They became the most powerful fighting force in the whole of Zimbabwe. The economic power of the Rozvi empire was based on cattle wealth and farming, with significant gold mining. They established connections with Arab traders, in which valuable items such as gold, copper, and ivory were exchanged for imported luxury goods. Records from the Portuguese show that the Rozvi were sophisticated military strategists. They were noted for using the cow-horn formation years before the great Zulu leader Shaka adopted it in the 19th century. Armed with spears, shields, bows and arrows, the aggressive Rozvi took over the Zimbabwe plateau. Invasion and demise The late 1700s and early 1800s saw the Rozvi Empire face a number of challenges. The Empire, like the Mwenemutapa Empire, was federal in nature and political tensions between allied kingdoms and the ruling dynasty resulted in some kingdoms (e.g. Manyika) and chieftainships breaking away from the Empire. Internal palace revolutions and constant attacks from the BaMangwato placed increased political pressure on the empire. Two major droughts, one in 1795 to 1800 and 1824 to 1829 contributed to the worsening political instability. As the demand for gold decreased as long term trading partners like the Portuguese shifted their attention to slaves, the Shona tradition of gold mining and trading which had lasted for almost a millennium declined and with it the power held by central governments like the Rozvi started to weaken. On top of all the challenges, the 1830s were a time of multiple invasions and wars that the Rozvi Empire never recovered completely from. In the area of modern day South Africa, a number of events resulted in a mass exodus. Drought, invading Dutch settlers and the catastrophic aftermath of the Mfecane resulted in waves of Nguni tribes moving north. Successive attacks on the Empire by the armies of Mpanga, Ngwana, Maseko and Zwangendaba were repelled driving off the attackers but a great deal of damage had been done. Without any time to recover, another wave of attacks by the group led by the Swazi Queen Nyamazanana resulted in the capture of the capital Manyanga and the murder of the Rozvi Mambo Chirisamhuru. Still, contrary to the established narrative, this was not the end of the Rozvi Empire. Chirisamhuru's son, Tohwechipi escaped and went into exile in the Buhera area. With the support of the Mutinhima and other Noble Rozvi Houses, Tohwechipi effectively became the Rozvi Mambo. Mzilikazi realized that even though some of the Rozvi nobility had accepted him as King, the majority of the Shona did not accept him, limiting the geographic area of his Kingdom. Taking a diplomatic approach, he sent word to Tohwechipi asking him to return home and submit to him, crowning him King of the Shona. Tohwechipi did not accept Mzilikazi's offer and instead, consolidated his power and spent the next 30 years in a series of back and forth raids and counter-raids with Mzilikazi and eventually Lobengula, earning the nickname Chibhamubhamu because of his army of raiders armed with rifles. Tohwechipi was defeated in battle and around 1869 and curiously, Mzilikazi let him go. He died around 1873 and is believed to be buried in Gutu The Revival of Mambo's Dynasty in 2019 The mambo Dynasty was revised on 7 September 2019 when King Mike Moyo was installed as the new Mambo or Changamire of the Rozvi Kingdom. The installation took place at Ngondoma homestead near Mawabeni (Matabeleland South province). The event was attended by Chiefs Makoni and Svosve, from Rusape and Marondera respectively. Among those present were chiefs Musarurwa, Chiduku, Muusha, Kareya, Ngezi, Mawarire, Bere, Mashayamombe, Murinye, Tangwena, Saunyama, Serima and Gutu, among several others.

With cliffs rising straight up from the water, it is the central feature of Mount Kineo State Park, a protected area of managed by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. History ; Native American Native Americans once traveled great distances to Mt. Kineo to acquire its rhyolite rock. The mountain is said to contain one of the largest formations of rhyolite in the world. This rhyolite is evidence of an igneous (volcanic) phase although the mountain formations also contain slate and sandstone demonstrating sedimentary and metaphoric history as well. The mechanical properties of the rhyolite on Mount Kineo exhibits the physical properties of flint and was used extensively by indigenous peoples to make arrowheads and implements and thus, has often been referred to as \\"Kineo flint\\" in literature; but this term misleads by implication that the rhyolite is a cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz derived from a sedimentary origin. The rhyolite is actually an igneous extrusive material implying a volcanic phase that created the unique properties of this highly sought after material. Being the country's largest known mass of this rock, once used by Indians to craft arrowheads, hatchets, chisels, etc., Indian implements made from the stone have been found in all parts of New England and even further south, it is evident that various tribes visited Mt. Kineo for centuries to obtain this material. ; Notable visitors In 1846, Henry David Thoreau visited the Moosehead Lake region, and the mountain's geological formation, Indian relics and traditions deeply interested him. ; Hotel resort The first Mt. Kineo House was built on the shores of Moosehead Lake in 1848, but burned in 1868. Rebuilt in 1870 and opened in 1871, the second Mt. Kineo House burned again in 1882. Designed by Arthur H. Vinal, the third Mt. Kineo House opened in 1884. In 1911, the Maine Central Railroad purchased the resort and engaged the Hiram Ricker Hotel Company to operate it. Then the largest inland waterfront hotel in America, it had accommodations for over 500 guests. In 1933, the railroad eliminated its Kineo branch, and in 1938 sold the hotel. It burned during demolition and today the old employee house still stands next to hole # 9 of the golf course. File:Steamer Arriving at Mt. Kineo.jpg|Steamer arriving at Mt. Kineo in 1906 File:Mt.

Originally a public relations term, the growth of the internet and social media, along with reputation management companies, have made search results a core part of an individual's or group's reputation. Online reputation management, sometimes abbreviated as ORM, focuses on the management of product and service search website results. Ethical grey areas include mug shot removal sites, astroturfing customer review sites, censoring negative complaints, and using search engine optimization tactics to influence results. With extensive developments in this field of public relations, in-sync with the growth of the internet and social media, along with the advent of reputation management companies, the overall outlook of search results has become an integral part of what defines \\"reputation\\" and subsequent to all these developments, reputation management now exists under two spheres: online and offline reputation management. Online reputation management focuses on the management of product and service search results within the digital space, that is why it is common to see the same suggested links in the first page of a Google search. A variety of electronic markets and online communities like e-Bay, Amazon and Alibaba have ORM systems built in, and using effective control nodes these can minimize the threat and protect systems from possible misuses and abuses by malicious nodes in decentralized overlay networks. Offline reputation management shapes public perception of a said entity outside the digital sphere using select clearly defined controls and measures towards a desired result ideally representing what stakeholders think and feel about that entity.Hall, R. 1992. The Strategic Analysis of Intangible Resources. Strateg. Manage. J. 13(2) 135 The most popular controls for off-line reputation management include social responsibility, media visibility, press releases in print media and sponsorship amongst related tools.(What's in a Name? Reputation Building and Corporate Strategy, Fombrun, Charles; Shanley, Mark, Academy of Management Journal; Jun 1990; 33, 2; ABI/INFORM Global, pp239 ‚Äì 240.) Within the last decade of active social media use, marketing a company and promoting their products online have become large components of businesses and their strategies. In terms of reputation management, companies must now be more aware of how they are perceived by their audiences both inside and outside of their target market. A problem which often arises from this is false advertising. In the past monetising internet posts and blogs would have been a foreign concept to most corporations and their consumers. However, due to the competitive market, it is far more difficult to get noticed and become popular within the realm of online business or among influencers because of how the algorithms work on social media. The more funds a company has, the more marketing they can produce and the more money can be put into restoring or furthering their reputations. History Reputation is a social construct based on the opinion other people hold about a person or thing. Before the internet was developed, consumers wanting to learn about a company had few options. They had access to resources such as the Yellow Pages, but mostly relied on word-of-mouth. A company's reputation depended on personal experience. A company grew and expanded based on the market's perception of the brand. Public relations was developed to manage the image and build the reputation of a company or individual. The concept was initially created to broaden public relations outside of media relations. Academic studies have identified it as a driving force behind Fortune 500 corporate public relations since the beginning of the 21st century. Originally, public relations included printed media, events and networking campaigns. In 1998, Google was founded. The popularity of the internet introduced new marketing and branding opportunities. Where once journalists were the main source of media content, blogs, review sites and social media gave a voice to consumers regardless of qualification. Public relations became part of online reputation management (ORM). ORM includes traditional reputation strategies of public relations but also focuses on building a long-term reputation strategy that is consistent across all web-based channels and platforms. ORM includes search engine reputation management which is designed to counter negative search results and elevate positive content. Some businesses have adopted unethical means to falsely improve their reputations. In 2007, a study by the University of California Berkeley found that some sellers on eBay were undertaking reputation management by selling products at a discount in exchange for positive feedback to game the system. Online reputation management Reputation management (sometimes referred to as rep management or ORM) is the practice of attempting to shape public perception of a person or organization by influencing information about that entity, primarily online. What necessitates this shaping of perceptions being the role of consumers in any organization and the cognizance of how much if ignored these perceptions may harm a company's performance at any time of the year, a risk no entrepreneur or company executive can afford. Specifically, reputation management involves the monitoring of the reputation of an individual or a brand on the internet, primarily focusing on the various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, etc. addressing content which is potentially damaging to it, and using customer feedback to try to solve problems before they damage the individual's or brand's reputation. A major part of reputation management involves suppressing negative search results, while highlighting positive ones. For businesses, reputation management usually involves an attempt to bridge the gap between how a company perceives itself and how others view it. In 2012, there had been an article released titled \\"Social Media Research in Advertising, Communication, Marketing and Public Relations\\" written by Hyoungkoo Khang et-al. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254120644_Social_Media_Research_in_Advertising_Communication_Marketing_and_Public_Relations_1997-2010 The references to Kaplan and Haenleins theory of social presence, highlights the \\"concept of self-presentation.\\" Due to the nature of social platforms such as ‚ÄòTwitter,‚Äô public opinion has never in history been allowed such vast allowances to voice whatever concerns or thoughts they may have. Managing online representations has become a part of the marketing department for companies as reviews and sometimes even allegations against a well-known organisation can tarnish the whole company, often due to cancel culture. Audiences are easily swayed drastically to change their opinions and entitled reviews, which hold a huge power against the businesses. As often when a scandal arises, many are quick to boycott, without having learned the evidence which thus can destroy someone else‚Äôs livelihood unjustly. Khang highlights that ‚Äúcompanies must monitor individual's comments regarding service 24/7.\\" This can imply that the reputation of a company does essentially rely on the consumer, as they are the ones that can make or break it. People of the internet no longer rely their trust on advertisements, rather it is the reviews of others that often sells a product. The question at hand is if it is ethical to follow influencers who are often portraying a clean slate lifestyle and promoting products or services they don't believe in. However, in recent times, the backlash of this is more apparent, an example being Instagram models who advertise ‚Äòfit-teas‚Äô to appear more slimmer, have been accused of being the stem of societal beauty pressures and seen as harmful to the youth. What Khang deliberates, is actually ironic. How a social influencer holds this power of essentially influencing their products and opinions on their audiences or even society, whereas on the other hand, the audiences have a ‚Äòpower‚Äô to sometimes even destroy a career because of backlash. Benefits A fast-growing discipline and corporate necessity, reputation management is widely acknowledged as a valuable intangible asset which can be one of the most important sources of competitive edge in a fiercely competitive market,Weigelt, K., and C. Camerer (1988). \\"Reputation and corporate strategy: A review of recent theory and applications.\\" Strategic Management Journal 9: 443-454. and with firms constantly under increased scrutiny from the business community, regulators, and corporate governance watchdogs good reputation management practices continue to help firms cope with this scrutiny.(Hymowitz, C. (2003). 'How to be a good director?', Wall Street Journal, 241, pp. R1‚ÄìR4). Other benefits of sound reputation management practices is how much they reinforce and aid a corporation's branding objectives which on their own along the way play a paramount role in helping a company meet its marketing and business communication objectives, a key driver towards how much any company can go towards increasing profits and its market share. Good reputation management practices are also important in helping any entity manage staff confidence as a control tool on public perceptions which if undermined and ignored can be costly, which in the long run may cripple employee confidence, a risk no employer would dare explore as staff morale is one of the most important drivers of company performance. Reputation management campaigns in popular media In 2011, controversy around the Taco Bell restaurant chain arose when public accusations were made that their \\"seasoned beef\\" product was only made up of only 35% real beef. A class action lawsuit was filed by the law firm Beasley Allen against Taco Bell. The suit was voluntarily withdrawn with Beasley Allen citing that \\"From the inception of this case, we stated that if Taco Bell would make certain changes regarding disclosure and marketing of its 'seasoned beef' product, the case could be dismissed.\\" Taco Bell responded to the case being withdrawn by launching a reputation management campaign titled \\"Would it kill you to say you're sorry?\\" that ran advertisements in various news outlets in print and online, which attempted to draw attention to the voluntary withdrawal of the case. Examples Companies often attempt to manage their reputations on websites that many people visit, such as eBay, Wikipedia, and Google. Some of the tactics used by reputation management firms include: * Improving the tagging and search engine optimization of company-published materials, such as white papers and positive customer testimonials in order to push down negative content. * Publishing original, positive websites and social media profiles, with the aim of outperforming negative results in a search. * Submitting online press releases to authoritative websites in order to promote brand presence and suppress negative content. * Submitting legal take-down requests if someone believes they have been libeled. * Getting mentions of the business or individual on third-party sites that rank highly on Google. * Creating fake, positive reviews of the individual or business to counteract negative ones. * Using spambots and denial-of-service attacks to force sites with damaging content off the web entirely. * Astroturfing third-party websites by creating anonymous accounts that create positive reviews or lash out against negative ones. * Proactively offering free products to prominent reviewers. * Removing online mug shots. * Proactively responding to public criticism stemming from recent changes. * Removing or suppressing images that are embarrassing or violate copyright. * Contacting Wikipedia editors to remove allegedly incorrect information from the Wikipedia pages of businesses they represent. Ethics The practice of reputation management raises many ethical questions. It is widely disagreed upon where the line for disclosure, astroturfing, and censorship should be drawn. Firms have been known to hire staff to pose as bloggers on third-party sites without disclosing they were paid, and some have been criticized for asking websites to remove negative posts. The exposure of unethical reputation management can itself be risky to the reputation of a firm that attempts it. Some firms practice ethical forms of reputation management. Google considers there to be nothing inherently wrong with reputation management, and even introduced a toolset in 2011 for users to monitor their online identity and request the removal of unwanted content. Many firms are selective about clients they accept. For example, they may avoid individuals who committed violent crimes who are looking to push information about their crimes lower on search results. In 2010 a study showed that Naymz, one of the first Web 2.0 services to provide utilities for Online Reputation Management (ORM), had developed a method to assess the online reputation of its members (RepScore) that was rather easy to deceive. The study found that the highest level of online reputation was easily achieved by engaging a small social group of nine persons who connect with each other and provide reciprocal positive feedbacks and endorsements. As of December 2017, Naymz was shut down. In 2015, the online retailer Amazon.com sued 1,114 people who were paid to publish fake five-star reviews for products. These reviews were created using a website for Macrotasking, Fiverr.com. Several other companies offer fake Yelp and Facebook reviews, and one journalist amassed five-star reviews for a business that doesn't exist, from social media accounts that have also given overwhelmingly positive reviews to \\"a chiropractor in Arizona, a hair salon in London, a limo company in North Carolina, a realtor in Texas, and a locksmith in Florida, among other far- flung businesses\\". In 2016, the Washington Post detailed 25 court cases, at least 15 of which had false addresses for the defendant. The court cases had similar language and the defendant agreed to the injunction by the plaintiff, which allowed the reputation management company to issue takedown notices to Google, Yelp, Leagle, Ripoff Report, various news sites, and other websites.

Hill is widely known for pioneering the \\"Bradford Hill\\" criteria for determining a causal association. Early life Hill was born in London, son of Sir Leonard Erskine Hill FRS, a distinguished physiologist, and Janet Alexander. He was the grandson of noted scholar George Birkbeck Hill. As a child he lived at the family home, Osborne House, Loughton, Essex; he was educated at Chigwell School, Essex. He served as a pilot in the First World War but was invalided out when he contracted tuberculosis. Two years in hospital and two years of convalescence put a medical qualification out of the question and he took a degree in economics by correspondence at London University. Career In 1922, Hill went to work for the Industry Fatigue Research Board. He was associated with the medical statistician Major Greenwood and, to improve his statistical knowledge, Hill attended lectures by Karl Pearson. When Greenwood accepted a chair at the newly formed London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Hill moved with him, becoming Reader in Epidemiology and Vital Statistics in 1933 and Professor of Medical Statistics in 1947. Hill had a distinguished career in research and teaching and as author of a very successful textbook, Principles of Medical Statistics, but he is famous for two landmark studies. He was the statistician on the Medical Research Council Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Committee and their study evaluating the use of streptomycin in treating tuberculosis, is generally accepted as the first randomised clinical trial. The use of randomisation in agricultural experiments had been pioneered by Ronald Aylmer Fisher. The second study was rather a series of studies with Richard Doll on smoking and lung cancer. The first paper, published in 1950, was a case-control study comparing lung cancer patients with matched controls. Doll and Hill also started a long-term prospective study of smoking and health. This was an investigation of the smoking habits and health of 40,701 British doctors for several years (British doctors study). Fisher was in profound disagreement with the conclusions and procedures of the smoking/cancer work and from 1957 he criticised the work in the press and in academic publications. In 1965, built upon the work of Hume and Popper, Hill suggested several aspects of causality in medicine and biology, which have remained in use by epidemiologists to date. On Hill's death in 1991, Peter Armitage wrote, \\"to anyone involved in medical statistics, epidemiology or public health, Bradford Hill was quite simply the world's leading medical statistician.\\" Honours In 1950‚Äì52, Hill was president of the Royal Statistical Society and was awarded its Guy Medal in Gold in 1953. Hill was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1954. Fisher was actually one of the proposers.

John Gower's \\"Tale of Constance\\" in Confessio Amantis tells the same story and may have been a source for Chaucer. Nicholas Trivet's Les chronicles was a source for both authors. Wurtele provides a detailed compilation of the differences between Trivet's Chronicle and the poems of Gower and Chaucer. Gower strove for vividness and shortened the tale in places. Chaucer expanded the tale and emphasizes the holiness of Constance and how she was favoured by heaven. Hagiographic motifs are most abundant in Chaucer's version, e.g. ‚Äúthe miracles God works though Custance and the way she is miraculously fed while at sea‚Äù.[22] Wurtele observes that Chaucer makes frequent use of the adjective \\"hooly\\" but Gower never uses this word. Synopsis (References here are to line numbers in both Man of Law's Tale (MLT) and Confessio Amantis(CA).) Constance (Custance in Chaucer) is the daughter of the emperor in Rome. Syrian merchants report her great beauty to the Sultan. A marriage contract is negotiated by her father which requires the Sultan and his subjects to convert to Christianity.MLT or CA (Middle English, based on Macaulay 1901) The Sultan's mother, enraged that her son would turn his back on Islam, connives to prevent this by massacring her son and the wedding party and having Constance set adrift on the sea. MLT or CA Her adventures and trials continue after she is shipwrecked on the Northumberland coast. The validity of her Christian faith is proved by two miracles. Her companion Hermengyld heals a blind man.MLT or CA A wicked knight who wishes to seduce Constance murders Hermengyld and attempts to frame Constance using the bloody dagger. He perjures himself and is mysteriously struck dead. MLT or CA Northumberland is a nominally pagan country where the King, Alla (based on Chaucer's understanding of the historical √Ülla of DeiraRossignol, Rosalyn. 2006. Critical companion to Chaucer: a literary reference to his life and work. New York: Facts on File, 169.) converted to Christianity after learning of the two miracles. Alla's evil mother intercepts and falsifies letters between the Alla and his constable, which results in Constance's being banished. MLT or CA Constance is forced to go to sea again and encounters one final antagonist. She runs aground in Spain; a would-be rapist (Thelous in CA) boards her ship but mysteriously falls overboard. MLT or CA She is found by a Senator of Rome. He is returning from a mission to Barberie (Syria) where he revenged the slaughter of Christians by the Sultan's mother. MLT or CA The Senator takes Constance (and her child) back to Italy to serve as a household servant. King Alla, still heartbroken over the loss of Constance, goes to Rome on a pilgrimage, and fortunately finds Constance. The couple returns to Northumberland. Alla dies a year later, Constance returns to Rome, and their son becomes the Emperor of Rome. MLT or CA Character of the Man of Law The Man of Law may have been based upon a real character. Two candidates are Thomas Pynchbek and Gower. Pynchbek \\"served as a justice of assize between 1376 and 1388 and was known for his acquisition of land, as well as for his learning; in 1388, as chief baron of the Exchequer, he signed a writ for GC's arrest in a case of debt\\". Accepting the latter requires accepting the debatable claim that Gower was practiced a lawyer. Yeager asserts that Gower had a \\"lawyerly habit of mind\\" but there is no evidence that he received formal training in the law. Chaucer himself is another candidate. Yet another view is taken by David who sees the Man of Law as \\"a representative of the self-appointed poetry critics with whom Chaucer disagreed. Man of Law as Narrator =Introduction= The Man of Law (referred to here as 'A Sergeant of the Lawe') is a judicious and dignified man, or, at least, he seems so because of his wise words. He is a judge in the court of assizes (civil procedures), by letter of appointment from the king, and has many goods and robes. He can draw up a legal document, the narrator tells us, and \\"no wight pinchen at his writing\\". The Man of Law rides in informal, silk-adorned clothes. GP The Host addresses the Man of Law with more respect than he does the Miller and the Reeve. The Man of Law's response to the host includes \\"behest [promise] is debt\\" which is a quotation from Justinian. Whatever the identity of the narrator, his knowledge of literature is erratic. Some of the Chaucerian works have not been 'published' which suggests he is part of Chaucer's literary circle. He confuses the Muses with the Pierides. Antiochus did not throw his daughter to the ground. The most debated passage in the Introduction is: ChaucerMS42131f16r :But certeinly no word ne writeth he :Of thilke wikke [wicked] ensample of Canacee, :That loved hir owene brother synfully ‚Äì :Of swiche cursed stories I sey fy! ‚Äì :Or ellis of Tyro Appollonius, :How that the cursed kyng Antiochus :Birafte his doghter of hir maydenhede, :That is so horrible a tale for to rede, :Whan he hir threw upon the pavement. Gower retold these two stories in Confessio. David observes that MLT is placed after somewhat immoral tales told by the Miller, the Reeve and the Cook. After Gower became aware of this passage, the Epilogue of Confessio was altered to remove praise of Chaucer. The three common interpretations are: * Gower was offended by this criticism and deliberately excised the praise of Chaucer which appears in the first recension of CA. * Macaulay argues the excision was an editing error, which was corrected in a subsequent recension of Confessio. * Fisher took the view that \\"moral Gower\\" was offended by the immoral tales found in the Canterbury Tales. =Tale= The narrator of the tale is less materialistic than the Sergeant of the Introduction (the description of the merchants' wealth is an exception ). \\"The tale, on the other hand, quite clearly reveals its narrator to be a devotee of justice in some ideal order, rather than a legal technician grown wealthy through sharp practices.\\" The events of the tale are the crimes discussed in Bracton's De legibus. \\"Simply from this point of view, and with respect to both style and substance, the received story as an aggregation of incidents is well suit for retelling by a Sergeant of the Law.\\" \\"Tortuous\\"MLT an astrological term may be confused with \\"tortious\\" which is a legal term. Apostrophe is used in several places. Another marked stylistic trait is his use of those rhetorical questions which punctuate with the regularity of a refrain the two passages (and ) emphasizing at some length the dangers that beset Constance when she is at the sultaness' feast, when she is drifting from Syria to Northumberland, and when the second miscreant assaults her. Some scholars disagree with the arguments given above. Spearing downplays the notion that the narration is the voice of a lawyer. Pearsall found nothing specific to a lawyer other than the response to the Host in the Introduction. Sources The tale is based on a story within the Chronicles of Nicholas Trivet but the major theme in the tale, of an exiled princess uncorrupted by her suffering, was common in the literature of the time.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England New York Burt Franklin,1963 Her tale is also told in John Gower's Confessio Amantis, and both are similar to the verse Romance Emar√©, and the cycle is generally known as the \\"Constance\\" cycle. The oldest known variant of this particular type is Vitae duorum Offarum. More distantly related forms of the persecuted heroine include Le Bone Florence of Rome, and Griselda.Carol Falvo Heffernan, Le Bone Florence of Rome, p 3 An incident where Constance is framed for murder by a bloody dagger appears to be a direct borrowing from Crescentia. GowerexMS42131f46v Sequence with other tales The Tale is the first in Fragment 2. Fragment 1 contains tales told by the Knight, Miller, Reeve and Cook. The various manuscripts of the Tales differ in the sequence of the Tales. 35 manuscripts contain the Man of Law's epilogue, while 22 others (including the Ellesmere Manuscript) do not. In the epilogue, the host invites the Parson to speak next, but the Parson is interrupted before he can begin and a different speaker tells the next tale. In the various manuscripts, the interrupter is Summoner, the Squire, or the Shipman, but it is the Shipman whose character best matches the rude remarks (although the mention of his \\"joly body\\" sounds closer to something the Wife of Bath might say). What this probably shows is that Chaucer had not fixed his overall plan. There are also hints, with his claim he will talk in prose despite rhyming throughout, that the Man of Law originally told the Tale of Melibee before he was assigned Custance's tale late in the composition of the tales.

Surrounded by low hills, it lies west of Masvingo, on the main Bulawayo-Masvingo road. Other roads lead from Zvishavane to Gweru, north, and Mberengwa, south-west. It is also on direct rail links to Gweru and Beit Bridge which then link up with Harare and Bulawayo in Zimbabwe and to Maputo in Mozambique, and Pretoria in South Africa. It has a private airport serving the city. Name Zvishavane was formerly called Shabanie (used by the mine) or Shabani (used for the town). The name \\"Shabanie\\" has been said to be derived from \\"shavani\\", a Ndebele word meaning \\"finger millet\\", or \\"trading together\\". Zvishavane is a Shona name, which is said to be derived from \\"zvikomo zvishava\\", which means \\"red hills\\". The name means \\"reddish or 'reddened' hills\\", referring to the many surrounding low hills that are characterised by red soil. History The town developed as a residential centre for Shabani Mine, which started operations in 1916 to supply asbestos during the First World War. Growth was slow due to poor communications until the railway reached the town in 1928. Although the asbestos mine is the biggest producer of the mineral in Zvishavane, platinum, gold, beryl, chromite, iron ore at Buchwa and huge deposits of diamond at Murowa are also mined in the area. The surrounding area is dominated by cattle ranching, while peasant agriculture is practiced in the nearby communal lands of Mberengwa and Buchwa. The administration of Zvishavane has developed over the years to keep pace with its growth. A Village Management Board was set up in 1921 and replaced with a Town Management Board in 1930. It was granted municipal status in 1968. Population The population of Zvishavane has grown substantially in recent decades due to a boom in mining activity. According to the 1982 Population Census, the town had a population of 26,758. By 1992 this had risen to 32,984. The population grew further to 35,128 in 2002 and 45,325 by 2012.

However, there have been several independent \\"successor\\" universities inheriting the name. The current consortium of French universities, grandes √©coles and other institutions of higher education and research in Toulouse and the surrounding region is known as Universit√© f√©d√©rale de Toulouse Midi-Pyr√©n√©es. History The formation of l'Universit√© de Toulouse was imposed on Count Raymond VII as a part of the Treaty of Paris in 1229 ending the crusade against the Albigensians. As he was suspected of sympathizing with the heretics, Raymond VII had to finance the teaching of theology. Bishop Foulques de Toulouse was among the founders of the University. Among its first lecturers were Jean de Garlande and Roland of Cremona. Other faculties (law, medicine) were added later. Initially, the University was located in the center of the city, together with the ancestors of student residences, the colleges. In 1969, l'Universit√© de Toulouse split into three separate universities and numerous specialised institutions of higher education. The present-day Universit√© de Toulouse was founded on 27 March 2007.

R. rickettsii is the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. R. rickettsii is one of the most pathogenic Rickettsia strains. It affects a large majority of the Western Hemisphere and small portions of the Eastern Hemisphere. History Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) first emerged in the Idaho Valley in 1896. At that time, not much information was known about the disease; it was originally called Black Measles because patients had a characteristic spotted rash appearance throughout their body. The first clinical description of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever was reported in 1899 by Edward E. Maxey. Howard Ricketts (1871‚Äì1910), an associate professor of pathology at the University of Chicago in 1902, was the first to identify and study R. rickettsii. At this time, the trademark rash now began to slowly emerge in the western Montana area, with an 80-90% mortality rate. His research entailed interviewing victims of the disease and collecting and studying infected animals. He was also known to inject himself with pathogens to measure their effects. Unfortunately, his research was cut short after his death, likely from an insect bite. S. Burt Wolbach is credited for the first detailed description of the pathogenic agent that causes R. rickettsii in 1919. He clearly recognized it as an intracellular bacterium which was seen most frequently in endothelial cells. Pathogen life cycle The most common hosts for the R. rickettsii bacteria are ticks. Ticks that carry R. rickettsia fall into the family of Ixodidae ticks, also known as \\"hard bodied\\" ticks. Ticks are vectors, reservoirs and amplifiers of this disease. There are currently three known tick specifics that commonly carry R. rickettsii. * American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis) * Rocky Mountain Wood Tick (Dermacentor andersoni) * Brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguine). Ticks can contract R. rickettsii by many means. First, an uninfected tick can become infected when feeding on the blood of an infected vertebrate host; such as a rabbit, during the larval or nymph stages, this mode of transmission called transstadial transmission. Once a tick becomes infected with this pathogen, they are infected for life. Both the American dog tick and the Rocky Mountain wood tick serve as long-term reservoirs for Rickettsia rickettsii, in which the organism resides in the tick posterior diverticulae of the midgut, the small intestine and the ovaries. In addition, an infected male tick can transmit the organism to an uninfected female during mating. Once infected, the female tick can transmit the infection to her offspring, in a process known as transovarian passage. =Transmission in mammals= Due to its confinement in the midgut and small intestine, Rickettsia rickettsii can be transmitted to mammals, including humans. Transmission to mammals can occur in multiple ways. One way of contraction is through the contact of infected host feces to an uninfected host. If infected host feces comes into contact with an open skin wound, it is possible for the disease to be transmitted. Additionally, an uninfected host can become infected with R. rickettsii when eating food that contains the feces of the infected vector. Another way of contraction is by the bite of an infected tick. After getting bitten by an infected tick, R. rickettsiae is transmitted to the bloodstream by tick salivary secretions. R. rickettsii has also been found to distort the sex ratio of their hosts. This is done by eradicating males and undergoing pathogenesis, this is done primarily via horizontal gene transfer. By eradicating male hosts, female host can pass the R. rickettsii gene to her offspring giving R. rickettsii bacteria yet another way to infect hosts. By having multiple modes of transmission this ensures the persistence of R. rickettsii in a population. Also, by having multiple modes of transmission this helps the disease adapt better to new environments and prevents it from becoming eradicated. R. rickettsii has evolved a number of strategical mechanisms or virulence factors that allow them to invade the host immune system and successfully infect the host.  Genomic Structure  R. rickettsii is an obligate intracellular alpha proteobacteria that belongs to the Rickettsiacea family. It is a pleomorphic, gram-negative coccobacillus that multiplies by binary fission. R. rickettsii is shown to have a genome size of around 2,100 kb. This number was determined via pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Virulence Since R. rickettsii needs a moving vector to contract the disease to a viable host it is more likely that this pathogen has moderately low virulence levels. This idea is supported by the tradeoff hypothesis which suggests that virulence of a pathogen will evolve until the level of virulence balances out with the level of transmission to maximize the spread of the pathogen. R. rickettsii invades the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels in the hosts body. Endothelial cells are not phagocytic in nature; however, after attachment to the cell surface, the pathogen causes changes in the host cell cytoskeleton that induces phagocytosis. Since the bacteria can now induce phagocytosis the R. rickettsii gene can be replicated and further invade other cells in the host's body.  Around the world  R. rickettsii is found on every continent excluding Antarctica. The disease was first discovered in North America and since then has been identified in almost every corner of the earth. The spread of R. rickettsii is likely due to the migration of humans and animals around the globe. However, R. rickettsii tends to thrive in warm damp places and this can be seen by contraction rates around the world. Environments are constantly changing so the fluctuation of the disease is never constant in a population and this correlates to the evolution of R. rickettsii. Clinical manifestations The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the diagnosis of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever must be made based on the clinical signs and symptoms of the patient and then later confirmed using specialized laboratory tests. However, the diagnosis of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is often misdiagnosed due to its non-specific onset. If not treated properly the illness may become serious, leading to hospitalization and possible fatality. =Initial signs and symptoms= During the initial stages of the disease, the patient could experience: * fever * nausea * vomiting * loss of appetite * conjunctival infection (red eyes) Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Rash =Rash = The classic Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever rash occurs in about 90% of patients and develops 2 to 5 days after the onset of fever. The characteristic rash appear as small, flat, pink macules that develop peripherally on the patient's body, such as the wrists, forearms, ankles, and feet. During the course of the disease, the rash will take on a more darkened red to purple spotted appearance and become more evenly distributed. =Late signs and symptoms= Diarrhea, abdominal and joint pain, and pinpoint reddish lesions (petechiae) are observed during the late stages of the disease. =Severe infections= Patients with severe infections may require hospitalization. They may become thrombocytopenic, hyponatremic, experience elevated liver enzymes, and other more pronounced symptoms. It is not uncommon for severe cases to involve the respiratory system, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system or the renal system complications. This disease is worst for elderly patients, males, African-Americans, alcoholics, and patients with G6PD deficiency. Deaths usually are caused by heart and kidney failure. Diagnosis and treatment =Laboratory confirmation= Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is often diagnosed using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), which is considered the reference standard by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The IFA will detect an increase in IgG or IgM antibodies in the bloodstream. A more specific lab test used in diagnosing Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is polymerase chain reaction or PCR which can detect the presence of rickettiae DNA. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining is another diagnostic approach where a skin biopsy is taken of the spotted rash; however, accuracy is only 70%. =Antibiotics= Doxycycline and Chloramphenicol are the most common drugs of choice for reducing the symptoms associated with RMSF. When it is suspected that a patient may have RMSF, it is crucial that antibiotic therapy be administered promptly. Failure to receive antibiotic therapy, especially during the initial stages of the disease, may lead to end-organ failure (heart, kidney, lungs) meningitis, brain damage, shock, and even death. Preventative Measures The main preventive measures are taken by containing and eliminating the carrier of the pathogen. Wearing long sleeve shirts and pants when in grassy areas provides a barrier from possible tick bites. By clearing leaf piles from the yard this will lessen the likelihood of ticks being in close proximity. Also by placing piles of wood in the sun eliminate the chance for ticks to reside in them. According to the CDC, using insect repellent and checking pets for ticks after being out in wooded or grassy areas can decrease the chances of being bitten by a tick carrying the pathogen significantly.

It is a member of the Local Group, and is a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). NGC 185 was discovered by William Herschel on November 30, 1787, and he cataloged it \\"H II.707\\". John Herschel observed the object again in 1833 when he cataloged it as \\"h 35\\", and then in 1864 when he cataloged it as \\"GC 90\\" within his General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters. NGC 185 was first photographed between 1898 and 1900 by James Edward Keeler with the Crossley Reflector of Lick Observatory. Unlike most dwarf elliptical galaxies, NGC 185 contains young stellar clusters, and star formation proceeded at a low rate until the recent past. NGC 185 has an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and is usually classified as a type 2 Seyfert galaxy, though its status as a Seyfert is questioned. It is possibly the closest Seyfert galaxy to Earth, and is the only known Seyfert in the Local Group. Distance measurements At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to NGC 185. The surface brightness fluctuations distance measurement technique estimates distances to galaxies based on the graininess of their appearance. The distance measured to NGC 185 using this technique is 2.08 ¬± 0.15 Mly (640 ¬± 50 kpc). However, NGC 185 is close enough that the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method may be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to NGC 185 using this technique is 2.02 ¬± 0.2 Mly (620 ¬± 60 kpc). Star formation Mart√≠nez- Delgado, Aparicio, & Gallart (1999) looked into the star formation history of NGC 185 and found that the majority of star formation in NGC 185 happened at early times. In the last ~1 Gyr, stars have formed only near the center of this galaxy. Walter Baade discovered young blue objects within this galaxy in 1951, but these have turned out to be star clusters and not individual stars. A supernova remnant near the center was also discovered by Mart√≠nez-Delgado et al.

Early life Onetti was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was the son of Carlos Onetti, a customs official of Irish descent, and Honoria Borges, a Brazilian who belonged to a Brazilian aristocratic family from the state of Rio Grande do Sul.http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/o/onetti.htm He had two siblings: an older brother Raul, and a younger sister Rachel. He remembered his childhood as a happy time, describing his parents as a very close and loving couple with their children. The original surname of his family was O'Nety (of Irish or Scottish origin). The writer himself commented: \\"the first to come here, my great-great-grandfather, was English, born in Gibraltar. My grandfather was the one who italianized the name\\". Career A high school drop-out, Onetti's first novel, El pozo, published in 1939, met with his close friends' immediate acclaim, as well as from some writers and journalists of his time. 500 copies of the book were printed, most of them left to rot at the only bookstore that sold it, Barreiro (the book was not reprinted until the 60's, with an introduction and preliminary study by √Ångel Rama). Aged 30, Onetti was already working as editing secretary of the famous weekly Uruguayan newspaper Marcha. He had lived for some years in Buenos Aires, where he published short stories and wrote cinema critiques for the local media, and met and befriended the notorious novelist and journalist Roberto Arlt, author of the novels El juguete rabioso, Los siete locos, Los lanzallamas. He went on to become one of Latin America's most distinguished writers, earning Uruguay National Literature Prize in 1962. He was considered a senior member of the 'Generation of 45', a Uruguayan intellectual and literary movement: Carlos Maggi, Manuel Flores Mora, √Ångel Rama, Emir Rodr√≠guez Monegal, Idea Vilari√±o, Carlos Real de Az√∫a, Carlos Mart√≠nez Moreno, Mario Arregui, Mauricio Muller, Jos√© Pedro D√≠az, Amanda Berenguer, Tola Invernizzi, Mario Benedetti, Ida Vitale, L√≠ber Falco, Juan Cunha, among others.Generaci√≥n del 45: severa en la cr√≠tica y brillante en la creaci√≥n. In 1974, he and some of his colleagues were imprisoned by the military dictatorship. Their crime: as members of the jury, they had chosen Nelson Marra's short story El guardaespaldas (i.e. \\"The bodyguard\\") as the winner of Marcha's annual literary contest. Due to a series of misunderstandings (and the need to fill some space in the following day's edition), El guardaespaldas was published in Marcha, although it had been widely agreed among them that they shouldn't and wouldn't do so, knowing this would be the perfect excuse for the military to intervene, considering the subject of the story (the interior monologue of a top-rank military officer who recounts his murders and atrocious behavior, much as it was happening with the functioning regime). Onetti left his native country (and his much-loved city of Montevideo) after being imprisoned for 6 months in Colonia Etchepare, a mental institution. A long list of world-famous writers -including Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa and Mario Benedetti ‚Äì signed open letters addressed to the military government of Uruguay. As soon as he was released, Onetti fled to Spain with his wife, the violin player Dorothea Muhr.

They are found in the Local Group as companions to the Milky Way and to systems that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). While similar to dwarf elliptical galaxies in appearance and properties such as little to no gas or dust or recent star formation, they are approximately spheroidal in shape and generally have lower luminosity.  Discovery  Despite the radii of dSphs being much larger than those of globular clusters, they are much more difficult to find due to their low luminosities and surface brightnesses. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies have a large range of luminosities, and known dwarf spheroidal galaxies span several orders of magnitude of luminosity. Their luminosities are so low that Ursa Minor, Carina, and Draco, the known dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the lowest luminosities, have mass-to-light ratios (M/L) greater than that of the Milky Way. Dwarf spheroidals also have little to no gas with no obvious signs of recent star formation. When it comes to the Local Group, dSphs are primarily found near the Milky Way and M31. The first dwarf spheroidal galaxies discovered were Sculptor and Fornax in 1938. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has resulted in the discovery of 11 more dSph galaxies as of 2007 By 2015, many more ultra-faint dSphs were discovered, all satellites of the Milky Way. Nine potentially new dSphs were discovered in the Dark Energy Survey in 2015. Each dSph is named after constellations they are discovered in, such as the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, all of which consist of stars generally much older than 1-2 Gyr that formed over the span of many gigayears. __For example, 98% of the stars in the Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy are older than 2 Gyr, formed over the course of three bursts around 3, 7, and 13 Gyr ago. The stars in Carina have also been found to be metal-poor. This is unlike star clusters because, while star clusters have stars which formed more or less the same time, dwarf spheroidal galaxies experience multiple bursts of star formation.  Evidence of dark matter  Because of the faintness of the lowest-luminosity dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the nature of the stars contained within them, some astronomers suggest that dwarf spheroidal galaxies and globular clusters may not be clearly separate and distinct types of objects. Other recent studies, however, have found a distinction in that the total amount of mass inferred from the motions of stars in dwarf spheroidals is many times that which can be accounted for by the mass of the stars themselves. Studies reveal that dwarf spheroidal galaxies have a dynamical mass of around 10^7 solar masses, which is very large despite the low luminosity of dSph galaxies. Although at fainter luminosities of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, it is not universally agreed upon how to differentiate between a dwarf spheroidal galaxy and a star cluster; however, many astronomers decide this depending on the object's dynamics: if it seems to have more dark matter, then it is likely that it is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy rather than a faint star cluster. In the current predominantly accepted Lambda cold dark matter cosmological model, the presence of dark matter is often cited as a reason to classify dwarf spheroidal galaxies as a different class of object from globular clusters, which show little to no signs of dark matter. Because of the extremely large amounts of dark matter in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, they may deserve the title \\"most dark matter-dominated galaxies.\\" Further evidence of the prevalence of dark matter in dSphs includes the case of Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which can be assumed to be in dynamic equilibrium to estimate mass and amount of dark matter, since the gravitational effects of the Milky Way are small. Unlike the Fornax galaxy, there is evidence that the UMa2, a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Ursa Major constellation, experiences strong tidal disturbances from the Milky Way. A topic of research is how much the internal dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies are affected by the gravitational tidal dynamics of the galaxy they are orbiting. In other words, dwarf spheroidal galaxies could be prevented from achieving equilibrium due to the gravitational field of the Milky Way or other galaxy that they orbit. For example, the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy has a velocity dispersion of 7.9¬±1.3 km/s, which is a velocity dispersion that could not be explained solely by its stellar mass according to the Virial Theorem. Similar to Sextans, previous studies of Hercules dwarf spheroidal galaxy reveal that its orbital path does not correspond to the mass contained in Hercules. Furthermore, there is evidence that the UMa2, a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Ursa Major constellation, experiences strong tidal disturbances from the Milky Way.

He discovered a refrigeration cycle and invented the first industrial-scale air separation and gas liquefaction processes, which lead to the first reliable and efficient compressed-ammonia refrigerator in 1876. These breakthroughs laid the backbone for the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics that was awarded to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. Linde was a member of scientific and engineering associations, including being on the board of trustees of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt and the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Linde was also the founder of what is now known as Linde plc, the world's largest industrial gases company, and ushered the creation of the supply chain of industrial gases as a profitable line of businesses. He was knighted in 1897 as Ritter von Linde. Biography =Early years= Born in , Bavaria as the son of a German-born minister and a Swedish mother, he was expected to follow in his father's footsteps but took another direction entirely. Von Linde's family moved to Munich in 1854, and eight years later he started a course in engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, where his teachers included Rudolf Clausius, Gustav Zeuner and Franz Reuleaux. In 1864, he was expelled before graduating for participating in a student protest, but Reuleaux found him a position as an apprentice at the Kottern cotton-spinning plant in Kempten. Linde stayed only a short time before moving first to Borsig in Berlin and then to the new Krauss locomotive factory in Munich, where he worked as head of the technical department. Von Linde married Helene Grimm in September 1866; their marriage lasted 53 years and they had six children. In 1868 Linde learned of a new university opening in Munich (the Technische Hochschule) and immediately applied for a job as a lecturer; he was accepted‚Äîat the age of 26‚Äîfor the position. He became a full professor of mechanical engineering in 1872, and set up an engineering lab where students such as Rudolf Diesel studied. =Middle years= In 1870 and 1871, Linde published articles in the Bavarian Industry and Trade Journal describing his research findings in the area of refrigeration. Linde's first refrigeration plants were commercially successful, and development began to take up increasing amounts of his time. In 1879, he gave up his professorship and founded the Gesellschaft f√ºr Lindes Eismaschinen Aktiengesellschaft (\\"Linde's Ice Machine Company\\"), now Linde plc, in Wiesbaden, Germany. After a slow start in a difficult German economy, business picked up quickly in the 1880s. The efficient new refrigeration technology offered big benefits to the breweries, and by 1890 Linde had sold 747 machines. In addition to the breweries, other uses for the new technology were found in slaughterhouses and cold storage facilities all over Europe. In 1888, Linde moved back to Munich where he took up his professorship once more but was soon back at work developing new refrigeration cycles. In 1892, an order from the Guinness brewery in Dublin for a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant drove Linde's research into the area of low-temperature refrigeration, and in 1894 he started work on a process for the liquefaction of air. In 1895, Linde first achieved success, and filed for patent protection of his process (not approved in the US until 1903). In 1901, Linde began work on a technique to obtain pure oxygen and nitrogen based on the fractional distillation of liquefied air. By 1910, coworkers including Carl's son Friedrich had developed the Linde double- column process, variants of which are still in common use today. After a decade, Linde withdrew from managerial activities to refocus on research, and in 1895 he succeeded in liquefying air by first compressing it and then letting it expand rapidly, thereby cooling it. He then obtained oxygen and nitrogen from the liquid air by slow warming. In the early days of oxygen production, the biggest use by far for the gas was the oxyacetylene torch, invented in France in 1903, which revolutionized metal cutting and welding in the construction of ships, skyscrapers, and other iron and steel structures. In 1897, Linde was appointed to the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown and ennobled in accordance with its statutes. In addition to Linde's technical and engineering abilities, he was a successful entrepreneur. He formed many successful partnerships in Germany and internationally, working effectively to exploit the value of his patents and knowledge through licensing arrangements. In 1906, Linde negotiated a stake in Brin's Oxygen Company, renamed The BOC Group. in exchange for rights to Linde's patents in the UK and other countries, and held a board position until 1914. Linde also formed the Linde Air Products Company in the USA in 1907, a company that passed through US Government control to Union Carbide in the 1940s and on to form Praxair. In 2005 Linde, plc bought the BOC Group, and in 2019 Linde plc merged with Praxair, thus combining all three companies founded by Linde. =Later years and death= From around 1910 Linde started transferring responsibility for the company's operation to his sons Friedrich and Richard and to his son-in- law Rudolf Wucherer. He continued with supervisory board and advisory duties until his death. Carl von Linde died in Munich in November 1934 at the age of 92. Key inventions Linde's first refrigeration system used dimethyl ether as the refrigerant and was built by Maschinenfabrik Augsburg (now MAN AG) for the Spaten Brewery in 1873. He quickly moved on to develop more reliable ammonia-based cycles. These were early examples of vapor-compression refrigeration machines, and ammonia is still in wide use as a refrigerant in industrial applications. His apparatus for the liquefaction of air combined the cooling effect achieved by allowing a compressed gas to expand (the Joule‚ÄìThomson effect first observed by James Prescott Joule and Lord Kelvin) with a counter-current heat exchange technique that used the cold air produced by expansion to chill ambient air entering the apparatus. Over a period of time this effect gradually cooled the apparatus and air within it to the point of liquefaction. Linde followed development of air liquefaction equipment with equipment that also separated air into its constituent parts using distillation processes. Linde's inventions and developments spurred development in many areas of cryogenics, physics, chemistry and engineering. =Patents= * CH10704 ‚Äì 31 January 1896 ‚Äì Gasverfl√ºssigungs-maschine (Machine for the liquefaction of gas) (in German) ‚Äì Switzerland * GB189512528 ‚Äì 16 May 1896 ‚Äì Process and Apparatus for Liquefying Gases or Gaseous Mixtures, and for Producing Cold, more particularly applicable for Separating Oxygen from Atmospheric Air ‚Äì UK * ‚Äì 12 May 1903 ‚Äì Linde oxygen process ‚Äì USA * ‚Äì 12 May 1903 ‚Äì Equipment for Linde oxygen process ‚Äì USA * ‚Äì 25 July 1905 ‚Äì Equipment for Linde oxygen and nitrogen process‚ÄîUSA Awards * Wilhelm Exner Medal, 1922 See also * Air separation * Hampson‚ÄìLinde cycle * Industrial gas * Timeline of low-temperature technology * German inventors and discoverers References Further reading * Carl von Linde: \\"Aus meinem Leben und von meiner Arbeit\\" (Memoirs: \\"From my life and about my work\\"), first published 1916, reprinted by Springer 1984, . * External links * Linde AG (Homepage) * 1842 births 1934 deaths Burials at Munich Waldfriedhof ETH Zurich alumni German company founders 19th-century German businesspeople 20th-century German businesspeople German mechanical engineers Engineers from Bavaria German inventors German industrialists Industrial gases People from the Kingdom of Bavaria People from Kulmbach (district) Technical University of Munich faculty Werner von Siemens Ring laureates Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art Recipients of the Pour le M√©rite (civil class) Linde plc people ","title":"Carl von Linde"},{"id":"993399","text":"Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales Sir Thopas is one of The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer, published in 1387. The tale is one of two‚Äîtogether with The Tale of Melibee‚Äîtold by the fictive Geoffrey Chaucer as he travels with the pilgrims on the journey to Canterbury Cathedral. The tale concerns the adventures of the knight \\"Sir Thopas\\" and his quest to win the elf-queen. Frame The tale is one of two told by the fictive Chaucer, along with the Tale of Melibee, who figures as one of the pilgrims who are on a journey to the shrine of Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral. The pilgrims are involved in a story-telling contest on the behest of the Host (Middle English: Hooste), Harry Bailly, the winner of which will receive a free meal at The Tabard Inn on their return. Sir Thopas comes after the Prioress's Tale, a poem which is exemplary of the miracle of the Virgin genre and which tells the story of a child martyr killed by Jews. Seemingly wishing to counter the sombre mood that this tale instills in the pilgrims, the Host hails Chaucer and suggests that he: \\"Telle us a tale of myrth, and that anon\\" (line 706).All line quotations, unless otherwise stated, are taken from: Larry D. Benson, ed. (1987). The Riverside Chaucer (3rd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chaucer admits to having no tales to tell other than a \\"rym [he] lerned longe agoon\\" (line 709), and on the acceptance of the Host proceeds to tell the \\"Tale of Thopas\\". Chaucer's portrait of himself is unflattering and humble. He presents himself as a reticent, maladroit figure who can barely summon a tale to mind.Prologue to Sir Thopas - lines 8-21 In comparison to the other travellers in the group, Chaucer the character is reluctant to speak, but when he does tell a tale, it is a rather frivolous burlesque very different from what went before. Synopsis The poem begins with an introduction to Sir Thopas, detailing his birthplace of Flanders, describing his physical appearance and abilities in hunting. He desires the elf-queen but is waylaid by the giant Sir Olifaunt ('Elephant'). He runs back to his merry men for a feast of sweets and to ready for a battle with his giant foe. The tale is interrupted by the Host, though, for its tail rhyme format and is never finished. The tale is a parody of romances, with their knights and fairies and absurdities, and Chaucer the author satirises not only the grandiose, Gallic romances, but also the readership of such tales. The tale is a hodgepodge of many of the popular stories of the time which even apes their simple rhymes, a style Chaucer uses nowhere else. Elements of deliberate anticlimax abound in as much of the poem as Chaucer is allowed to present. The knight's name is in fact topaz, one of the more common gemstones; in Chaucer's day, \\"topaz\\" included any yellowish quartz. The knight hails from Flanders, which earlier had been a favourite haunt of errant knights but in Chaucer's time was better known for prosaic merchants. In the only scene of derring-do that Chaucer tells in the two and a half chapters he gets in, Sir Thopas flees the battle, pelted by stones. The poem thus contains many suggestions that it was intended in a mock-heroic sense. Analysis =Genre and structure= Thopas is the first of what is usually called the surprise group of tales, as each is quite different from the preceding and they are seemingly written to confound expectations. The host, Harry Bailey, does not seem to appreciate this new style of tale and he interrupts Chaucer, telling him that \\"thy drasty rymyng is nat worth a toord\\". The character Chaucer then tells the laborious and dull debate of the Tale of Melibeus. Again, this is in keeping with the character Chaucer: a man of too much learning and too little experience. The tale is full of moral sentiment and philosophy, but it is fairly slow for modern readers. =Critical history= The reception of Sir Thopas is perhaps the most interesting thing about it. When Chaucer began to be treated as a treasure of English letters after his death, his satiric intent was lost. Into the eighteenth century, readers regarded Harry Bailey's interruption as a sign of poor breeding, and they treated the tale of Sir Thopas itself as a great work. It was Thomas Warton who first suggested (at least in print) that Chaucer was not serious, that the whole tale is a parody and that the character of Geoffrey Chaucer must not be confused with Geoffrey Chaucer the author.

Hibakusha (; or ; \\"person affected by a bomb\\" or \\"person affected by exposure [to a bomb]\\") is a word of Japanese origin generally designating the people affected by the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Definition The word hibakusha is Japanese, originally written in kanji. While the term Hibakusha (hi \\"affected\\" + baku \\"bomb\\" + sha \\"person\\") has been used before in Japanese to designate any victim of bombs, its worldwide democratisation led to a definition concerning the survivors of the atomic bombs dropped in Japan by the United States Army Air Forces on the 6 and 9 August 1945. Anti-nuclear movements and associations, among others of hibakusha, spread the term to designate any direct victim of nuclear disaster, including the ones of the nuclear plant in Fukushima. They therefore prefer the writing (substituting baku with the homophonous \\"exposition\\") or \\"person affected by the exposition\\", implying \\"person affected by nuclear exposure\\". This definition tends to be adopted since 2011. The juridic status of hibakusha is allocated to certain people, mainly by the Japanese government. Official recognition The Atomic Bomb Survivors Relief Law defines hibakusha as people who fall into one or more of the following categories: within a few kilometers of the hypocenters of the bombs; within 2 km of the hypocenters within two weeks of the bombings; exposed to radiation from fallout; or not yet born but carried by pregnant women in any of these categories. The Japanese government has recognized about 650,000 people as hibakusha. , 136,682 were still alive, mostly in Japan. The government of Japan recognizes about 1% of these as having illnesses caused by radiation. Hibakusha are entitled to government support. They receive a certain amount of allowance per month, and the ones certified as suffering from bomb-related diseases receive a special medical allowance. The memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain lists of the names of the hibakusha who are known to have died since the bombings. Updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings, , the memorials record the names of more than 510,000 hibakusha; 324,129 in Hiroshima and 185,982 in Nagasaki. Citizens of Hiroshima walk by the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, the closest building to Ground Zero not to have collapsed from \\"Little Boy\\". A photograph of Sumiteru Taniguchi's back injuries taken in January 1946 by a U.S. Marine photographer In 1957, the Japanese Parliament passed a law providing for free medical care for hibakusha. During the 1970s, non-Japanese hibakusha who suffered from those atomic attacks began to demand the right for free medical care and the right to stay in Japan for that purpose. In 1978, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that such persons were entitled to free medical care while staying in Japan.My Life: Interview with former Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka, Part 10, Chugoku Shimbun =Korean survivors= During the war, Japan brought many Korean conscripts to both Hiroshima and Nagasaki to work. According to recent estimates, about 20,000 Koreans were killed in Hiroshima and about 2,000 died in Nagasaki. It is estimated that one in seven of the Hiroshima victims was of Korean ancestry. For many years, Koreans had a difficult time fighting for recognition as atomic bomb victims and were denied health benefits. However, most issues have been addressed in recent years through lawsuits.Hibakusha: A Korean's fight to end discrimination toward foreign A-bomb victims , Mainichi Daily News. May 9, 2008. =Japanese- American survivors= It was a common practice before the war for American Issei, or first-generation immigrants, to send their children on extended trips to Japan to study or visit relatives. More Japanese immigrated to the U.S. from Hiroshima than from any other prefecture, and Nagasaki also sent a high number of immigrants to Hawai'i and the mainland. There was, therefore, a sizable population of American-born Nisei and Kibei living in their parents' hometowns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the time of the atomic bombings. The actual number of Japanese Americans affected by the bombings is unknown ‚Äì although estimates put approximately 11,000 in Hiroshima city alone ‚Äì but some 3,000 of them are known to have survived and returned to the U.S. after the war.Wake, Naoko. \\"Japanese American Hibakusha\\", Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved Aug 5, 2014. A second group of hibakusha counted among Japanese American survivors are those who came to the U.S. in a later wave of Japanese immigration during the 1950s and 1960s. Most in this group were born in Japan and migrated to the U.S. in search of educational and work opportunities that were scarce in post-war Japan. Many were \\"war brides\\", or Japanese women who had married American men related to the U.S. military's occupation of Japan. As of 2014, there are about 1,000 recorded Japanese American hibakusha living in the United States. They receive monetary support from the Japanese government and biannual medical checkups with Hiroshima and Nagasaki doctors familiar with the particular concerns of atomic bomb survivors. The U.S. government provides no support to Japanese American hibakusha. =Other foreign survivors= While one British Commonwealth citizen and seven Dutch POWs (two names known) died in the Nagasaki bombing, at least two POWs reportedly died postwar from cancer thought to have been caused by the atomic bomb.It Gave Him Life ‚Äì It Took It, Too United States Merchant Marine.org website] One American POW, Joe Kieyoomia, was a Navajo in Nagasaki at the time of the bombing but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell.\\"How Effective Was Navajo Code?

A documentary called Twice Survived: The Doubly Atomic Bombed of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was produced in 2006. The producers found 165 people who were victims of both bombings, and the production was screened at the United Nations. On March 24, 2009, the Japanese government officially recognized Tsutomu Yamaguchi (1916‚Äì2010) as a double hibakusha. Tsutomu Yamaguchi was confirmed to be 3 kilometers from ground zero in Hiroshima on a business trip when the bomb was detonated. He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima. He got back to his home city of Nagasaki on August 8, a day before the bomb in Nagasaki was dropped, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives. He was the first officially recognized survivor of both bombings. Tsutomu Yamaguchi died at the age of 93 on January 4, 2010, of stomach cancer.

United Nations's International Atomic Energy Agency building in Vienna, during the NPT PrepCom 2007. Hibakusha and their children were (and still are) victims of severe discrimination when it comes to prospects of marriage or work due to public ignorance about the consequences of radiation sickness, with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects/congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of the nuclear weapons used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or found in the later conceived children of cancer survivors who had previously received radiotherapy.The Children of Atomic Bomb Survivors: A Genetic Study. 1992. No differences were found (in frequencies of birth defects, stillbirths, etc), thus allaying the immediate public concern that atomic radiation might spawn an epidemic of malformed children.World Health Organization report. page 23 & 24 internal] The surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that could conceive, who were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities/birth defects than the rate which is observed in the Japanese average.http://www.rerf.jp/radefx/genetics_e/birthdef.html (RERF)Radiation Effects Research Foundation. Formerly known as the (ABCC)Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission. Studs Terkel's book The Good War includes a conversation with two hibakusha. The postscript observes: The is a group formed by hibakusha in 1956 with the goals of pressuring the Japanese government to improve support of the victims and lobbying governments for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Some estimates are that 140,000 people in Hiroshima (38.9% of the population) and 70,000 people in Nagasaki (28.0% of the population) died in 1945, but how many died immediately as a result of exposure to the blast, heat, or due to radiation, is unknown. One Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) report discusses 6,882 people examined in Hiroshima, and 6,621 people examined in Nagasaki, who were largely within 2000 meters from the hypocenter, who suffered injuries from the blast and heat but died from complications frequently compounded by acute radiation syndrome (ARS), all within about 20‚Äì30 days.Latest Knowledge on Radiological Effects: Radiation Health Effects of Atomic Bomb Explosions and Nuclear Power Plant Accidents In the rare cases of survival for individuals who were in utero at the time of the bombing and yet who still were close enough to be exposed to less than or equal to 0.57 Gy, no difference in their cognitive abilities was found, suggesting a threshold dose for pregnancies below which, no life-limiting issues arise. In 50 or so children who survived the gestational process and were exposed to more than this dose, putting them within about 1000 meters from the hypocenter, microcephaly was observed; this is the only elevated birth defect issue observed in the Hibakusha, occurring in approximately 50 in-utero individuals who were situated less than 1000 meters from the bombings. In a manner dependent on their distance from the hypocenter, in the 1987 Life Span Study, conducted by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, a statistical excess of 507 cancers, of undefined lethality, were observed in 79,972 hibakusha who had still been living between 1958‚Äì1987 and who took part in the study. An epidemiology study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers, of unspecified lethality, could be due to radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being estimated at 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality.

Watching the lights allows to follow the instructions and the changing data as it runs the Squares program displayed on the panels Blinkenlights on the NSA's FROSTBURG supercomputer from the 1990s. Blinkenlights is a neologism for diagnostic lights usually on the front panels on old mainframe computers, minicomputers, many early microcomputers, and modern network hardware. It has been seen on many artifacts of modern office machinery as well as, most notably, photocopiers.  Etymology  The Jargon File provides the following etymology: This term derives from the last word of the famous blackletter- Gothic sign in mangled mock German that once graced many computer rooms in the English-speaking world. One version read: This silliness dates back to least as far as 1955 at IBM and had already gone international by the early 1960s, when it was reported at the University of London's ATLAS computing site. There are several variants of it in circulation, some of which actually do end with the word blinkenlights. Although the sign might initially appear to be in German and uses an approximation of German grammar, it is composed largely of words that are either near-homonyms of English words or (in the cases of the longer words) actual English words that are rendered in a faux-German spelling. As such, the sign is generally comprehensible by many English speakers regardless of whether they have any fluency in German. Much of the humor in these signs was their intentionally incorrect language. Michael J. Preston recites the gem as being posted above photocopiers in offices as a warning not to mess with the machine in the first print reference from 1974. The sign is also reported to have been seen on an electron microscope at the Cavendish Laboratory in the 1950s. Such pseudo-German parodies were common in Allied machine shops during and following World War II, and an example photocopy is shown in the Jargon File. The Jargon File also mentions that German hackers have developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster, in fractured English:  Actual blinkenlights  The bits and digits in the earliest mechanical and vacuum tube-based computers were typically large and few, making it easy to see and often hear activity. Then, for decades, computers incorporated arrays of indicator lamps in their control panels, indicating the values carried on the address, data, and other internal buses, and in various registers. These could be used for diagnosing or \\"single- stepping\\" a halted machine, but even with the machine operating normally, a skilled operator could interpret the high-speed blur of the lamps to tell which section of a large program was executing, whether the program was caught in an endless loop, and so on. With rising processor clock rates, increased memory sizes, and improved interactive debugging tools, such panel lights gradually lost their usefulness, though today most devices have indicators showing power on/off status, hard disk activity, network activity, and other indicators of \\"signs of life\\". The original IBM PC could have a diagnostics card plugged into it that used LEDs to show what part of the memory it was using, and show the memory address and data code on 7-segment displays whenever the card was manually locked or automatically triggered. The Connection Machine, a -processor parallel computer designed in the mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side covered with a grid of red blinkenlights; the sales demo had them evolving Conway's Game of Life patterns. The CPU load monitors on the front of BeBoxes were also called \\"blinkenlights\\". Several computer components, such as the Ballistix Tactical Tracer memory modules from Crucial Technology and the NVidia Titan GTX, have user-controllable lights that can be configured to show useful information, such as the memory capacity used and the temperature of the components. This word gave its name to several projects, including screen savers, hardware gadgets, and other nostalgic things. Some notable enterprises include the German Chaos Computer Club's Project Blinkenlights and the Blinkenlights Archaeological Institute.

Boney James is a four-time Grammy Award nominee (Best Pop Instrumental Album, 2001, 2004, 2014 and Best Traditional R&B; Performance, 2009) and a Soul Train Award winner (Best Jazz Album 1998). He has also been honored with two NAACP Image Award nominations for Best Jazz Album. James has sold over three million albums, and has accumulated four RIAA Certified Gold Records. In 2009, Billboard magazine named James one of the Top 3 Billboard Contemporary Jazz Artists of the Decade.  Biography  Boney James took up the clarinet at the age of eight, switching to sax when he was ten. Boney spent his early teen years in New Rochelle, New York and became musically influenced by the R&B; Motown genre and saxophonist Grover Washington, Jr.. When James was fourteen his family moved to Los Angeles, where he joined a fusion band that opened for acts like Flora Purim and the Yellowjackets. Another member of this early band was John Shanks, now a successful pop producer. James eventually received a degree in History from UCLA, but began playing music full-time after graduation. James learned to play keyboards and in 1985 he joined Morris Day's band. His R&B; influence was further strengthened by seven years of touring and sessions as a sideman with Day, the Isley Brothers, Bobby Caldwell, Randy Crawford, Teena Marie and others. It was on the road with Crawford in 1986 that he earned his now-famous moniker, when his physique led a bandmate to joke \\"We'll have to start calling you Boney James!\\". In the early 1990s while on tour with Bobby Caldwell's band James met engineer and producer Paul Brown, beginning a 10-year period of collaboration. In 1992 Boney released his debut album as a leader, Trust, on the independent record label Spindletop Records. Following the record's success, James was signed by the Warner Brothers label in 1994. He released the RIAA Certified Gold Records, Seduction, Sweet Thing and Body Language on Warner Brothers. In 2000 he collaborated with trumpeter Rick Braun on an album called Shake it Up. Their duets include the now classic updated version of Hugh Masakela's \\"Grazin' in the Grass\\". Other artists who have made guest appearances on Boney's records include Raheem DeVaughn, Faith Evans, George Benson, George Duke, Dwele, Al Jarreau, Philip Bailey, Anthony Hamilton, Jaheim, Eric Ben√©t, Dave Hollister, Stokley Williams, Avery*Sunshine, Kenny Lattimore and Angie Stone. James began co-producing his records with Brown in 1997, and assumed the role of sole producer starting with his Grammy-nominated Pure album in 2003. Following a string of chart- topping albums, in 2006 James moved to Concord Records and released Shine which posted his career highest Billboard Pop Chart position to that date (No. 44 on the Top 200). His 2009 album, Send One Your Love earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&B; Performance. James' 2013 album The Beat received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Instrumental Album. On May 15, 2010, James was involved in a car crash coming home from a performance when he was rear ended by a drunk driver. James suffered a fractured jaw, two shattered teeth and facial lacerations. He was sidelined for two months. In 2014, James produced two songs on Al Jarreau's George Duke tribute album My Old Friend, \\"No Rhyme No Reason\\" (feat. Kelly Price) and \\"Bring Me Joy\\" (feat. George Duke). In 2015, he released futuresoul which spent eleven weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart. futuresoul was the bestselling Contemporary Jazz Record of 2015. In August 2015, James made his first appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. 2017 saw the release of Honestly, his 16th album. The record became James' eleventh No. 1 on the Billboard Jazz Albums Chart and also reached No. 22 on the Billboard Current Albums Chart, his highest pop chart debut to date. June 2020 Boney released his 17th studio album Solid. Boney James described the record as \\"a reaction to how stressful the world feels these days. Music is a respite, it‚Äôs always ‚Äòsolid‚Äô and it never lets me down.\\" The CD broke his previous Pop Chart record, debuting at #10 on the Billboard Top Albums Chart. Boney James is married to actress and director Lily Mariye. In 2012 he contributed an original score to her feature film directorial debut, Model Minority.

It is bounded laterally by the superior frontal sulcus. The superior frontal gyrus is one of the frontal gyri. Function =Self-awareness= In fMRI experiments, Goldberg et al. have found evidence that the superior frontal gyrus is involved in self- awareness, in coordination with the action of the sensory system.Watching the brain 'switch off' self-awareness at newscientist.com =Laughter= In 1998, neurosurgeon Itzhak Fried described a 16-year-old female patient (referred to as \\"patient AK\\") who laughed when her SFG was stimulated with electric current during treatment for epilepsy. Electrical stimulation was applied to the cortical surface of AK's left frontal lobe while an attempt was made to locate the focus of her epileptic seizures (which were never accompanied by laughter). Fried identified a 2 cm by 2 cm area on the left SFG where stimulation produced laughter consistently (over several trials). AK reported that the laughter was accompanied by a sensation of merriment or mirth. AK gave a different explanation for the laughter each time, attributing it to an (unfunny) external stimulus. Thus, laughter was attributed to the picture she was asked to name (saying \\"the horse is funny\\"), or to the sentence she was asked to read, or to persons present in the room (\\"you guys are just so funny... standing around\\"). Increasing the level of stimulation current increased the duration and intensity of laughter. For example, at low currents only a smile was present, while at higher currents a louder, contagious laughter was induced. The laughter was also accompanied by the stopping of all activities involving speech or hand movements.

Queen's University Belfast, 2008. p.29 is an upland region in Munster, Ireland. It is on the borders of counties Cork, Kerry and Limerick, and bounded to the south by the River Blackwater. It includes the Mullaghareirk Mountains. Music and literature Sliabh Luachra has produced several Irish poets: Geoffrey Fionn D√°laigh, Aog√°n √ì Rathaille, and the charismatic Gaelic poet Eoghan Rua √ì S√∫illeabh√°in (1748‚Äì1784). This latter poet's many exploits live on in local folklore, as do his poetry and aislings (dramatic descriptions). His solo set dance, \\"Rodney's Glory,\\" was composed in 1783 and follows his adventures after being forced to join the British Navy. Sliabh Luachra was also the birthplace of the folklorist, poet, and translator Edward Walsh (1805‚Äì1850), Patrick S. Dinneen, who compiled Dineen's Dictionary, viewed as the \\"bible\\" of Irish language, and Tom√°s Rathaille, Superior General of the Presentation Brothers 1905‚Äì1925 who wrote two books of Irish poetry: An Spideog and An Cuaic√≠n Draoidheachta. This tradition of poetry continues to present day with Bernard O'Donoghue (now a lecturer in Oxford University) who won the prestigious Whitbread prize for a collection of poems in 1993/94. Professor Daniel Corkery, author of The Hidden Ireland wrote that Sliabh Luachra was the literary capital of Ireland.http://www.sliabhluachra.com/history?page=2 This region has a unique musical style which makes heavy use of the polka and the slide. Musicians from the area include Denis Murphy, Julia Clifford, Paddy Cronin, Padraig O'Keeffe, Terence Teahan, Johnny O'Leary, Maurice O' Keeffe, Jackie Daly, Con Curtin and Donal Murphy. Religion St Moling was born in Sliabh Luachra in 614 AD. History The mountainous area along the Cork/Kerry border is known as Sliabh Luachra. This uninhabited wet, marshy, rushy, mountain area of the old Kingdom of Luachra was first noted in the Annals of Inisfallen in 534 when the King of Luacar won a battle against Tuathal Moel nGarb. It came to light again in 741 AD with the death of Cuaine, Abbot of Ferna and Flan Ferna, son of Cormac King of Luachra. Hundreds of years ago, the area was sparsely populated. It was an area of bogs, rushes, marshes, and woodlands, an area only suitable for refugees trying to avoid the imperial authorities. Its remoteness and the barren soil proved attractive to those people as the authorities were less likely to bother them in their inhospitable environment. Settlement did not come to the remaining thousand square miles of Sliabh Luachra until the Desmond rebellion. This rebellion ended with the death of Gerald Fitzgerald, the 15th Earl of Desmond in 1583. His last hiding place, Teach an Iarla, can still be seen cut into a glen in the heart of the Sliabh Luachra mountains near the source of the river Blackwater. The rebellion resulted in the scorched earth policy of Queen Elizabeth's army, which devastated much of Munster. Men, women and children were put to the sword and land and crops were burned, resulting in a great famine, impacting the area from Ventry to Cashel. Following this devastation, Munster began restoration with a half a million acres being declared Crown property and being distributed to English landlords. Former inhabitants were ordered to relocate to Connacht. Some of the dispossessed and poverty stricken people of Munster took refuge in Sliabh Luachra, which was also Crown property. Much of this land was recorded as mountain pastures; however, the authorities were unsuccessful at its distribution to landlords. This area remained undisturbed and largely unaccounted for until the agrarian disturbances of the Rockite movement in the 1820s. The Rockite movement began in West Limerick in the summer of 1821. The first leader of the Rockite movement, known as Captain Rock, was a Patrick Dillane who may have come from the Sliabh Luachra area. Many of the leaders of the movement hid in Sliabh Luachra, thereby creating British Government concern over the area's preponderance of outlaws and rebels. Further, the Government was not receiving any revenues from the area and was unable to control the 960 square miles due to lack of roads and communication. A report by James Weale on the Crown Lands of County Cork addressed the Government's apprehensions in the House of Commons. It also pointed out that, in the summer, farmers from North Kerry and parts of West Limerick would transport butter on horseback via a mountain path through the Rockchapel to Newmarket, two firkins per horse. There, it was transferred to horse carts carrying 24 firkins and sent on to the largest butter market in the world in Cork City. In 1830, these farmers sent 30,000 firkins valued at 52,000, with much of it passing through the Rockchapel mountain path. This report then initiated a program of road building, including the road from Castle Island to Clonbanin, from Ballydesmond to Newmarket, and the new line road, along the Feale Valley from Feales Bridge through Rockchapel to Newmarket, The engineering work on these roads and bridges was completed by Richard Griffith, who later became well known in Ireland through his Griffith valuations of 1852. The report also created the village of Kingwilliamstown (Ballydesmond), as was a model farm at Glencollins near Ballydesmond. Here, it was demonstrated that good grass could be grown on peaty soil by the use of burnt lime, resulting in the building of lime kilns in and around the Sliabh Luachra area. In 1896, Gneeveeguilla was the scene of the devastating moving bog, a landslide which wiped out an entire family as they slept. The first Auxiliary Division fatality was killed in Rathmore on 11 July 1920. The Headford Ambush took place at Barraduff in 1921. Thirty-two IRA volunteers ambushed a train carrying British soldiers. A total of sixteen people died including ten British soldiers, two IRA volunteers and four civilians. Geography Opinions differ as to the exact region of Sliabh Luachra, but it is generally accepted to refer to the mountainous, rush-filled upland that straddles the border area of Cork, Kerry, and Limerick, including the Kerry parishes of Ballymacelligott, Cordal, Brosna, Knocknagoshel, Barraduff, Gneeveguilla, Scartaglen and Rathmore, the Cork villages of Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Rockchapel, Knocknagree, Cullen, Boherbue, Meelin, and Freemount, and the Limerick villages of KilleedyTournafulla, Templeglantine, Athea, Mountcollins and Abbeyfeale Etymology The name Sliabh Luachra means \\"a mountain of rushes\\". However, it is not a single mountain, but a rolling plateau interspersed with what is generally accepted as its seven glens, or 'seacht ngleann Shliabh Luachra', over which various mountain peaks reach heights of 500 metres.

From 9 April to 16 May 1917, British troops attacked German defences near the French city of Arras on the Western Front. The British achieved the longest advance since trench warfare had begun, surpassing the record set by the French Sixth Army on 1 July 1916. The British advance slowed in the next few days and the German defence recovered. The battle became a costly stalemate for both sides and by the end of the battle, the British Third and First Army had suffered about 160,000 casualties and the German 6th Army about 125,000. For much of the war, the opposing armies on the Western Front were at stalemate, with a continuous line of trenches from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border. The Allied objective from early 1915 was to break through the German defences into the open ground beyond and engage the numerically inferior German Army () in a war of movement. The British attack at Arras was part of the French Nivelle Offensive, the main part of which was the Second Battle of the Aisne to the south. The aim of the French offensive was to break through the German defences in forty-eight hours. At Arras the Canadians were to re-capture Vimy Ridge, dominating the Douai Plain to the east, advance towards Cambrai and divert German reserves from the French front. The British effort was an assault on a relatively broad front between Vimy in the north-west and Bullecourt to the south-east. After a long preparatory bombardment, the Canadian Corps of the First Army in the north fought the Battle of Vimy Ridge, capturing the ridge. The Third Army in the centre advanced astride the Scarpe River and in the south, the British Fifth Army attacked the Hindenburg Line () but made few gains. The British armies then conducted smaller attacks to consolidate the new positions. Although these battles were generally successful in achieving limited aims, they came at considerable cost. When the battle officially ended on 16 May, the British had made significant advances but had been unable to achieve a breakthrough. New tactics and the equipment to exploit them had been used, showing that the British had absorbed the lessons of the Battle of the Somme and could mount set-piece attacks against fortified field defences. After the Second Battle of Bullecourt (3‚Äì17 May), the Arras sector became a quiet front, that typified most of the war in the west, except for attacks on the Hindenburg Line and around Lens, culminating in the Canadian Battle of Hill 70 (15‚Äì25 August). Background At the beginning of 1917, the British and French were still searching for a way to achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the River Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations. =Home fronts= The mid-war years were momentous times. Governing politicians in Paris and London were under great pressure from the press, the people and their parliaments to win the war. Hundreds of thousands of casualties had been suffered at the battles of Gallipoli, the Somme and Verdun, with little prospect of victory in sight. The British Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, resigned in early December 1916 and was succeeded by David Lloyd George. In France, Prime Minister Aristide Briand, along with Minister of Defence Hubert Lyautey were politically diminished and resigned in March 1917, following disagreements over the prospective Nivelle Offensive. The United States was close to declaring war on Germany; American public opinion was growing increasingly incensed by U-boat attacks upon civilian shipping, which had begun with the sinking of in 1915 and culminated in the torpedoing of seven American merchantmen in early 1917. The United States Congress declared war on Imperial Germany on 6 April 1917 but it would be more than a year before a suitable army could be raised, trained and transported to France. =Strategy= The French, Russians and British had intended to launch a joint spring offensive in 1917 but this strategy foundered in February when the Russians admitted that they could not meet their commitments. The spring offensive was reduced from attacks on the Eastern and Western fronts to a French assault along the Aisne River. In March, the German army in the west (), withdrew to the Hindenburg line in Operation Alberich, negating the tactical assumptions underlying the plans for the French offensive. Until French troops advanced into the former Noyon Salient during the Battles of Arras, they encountered no German troops in the assault sector and French doubts over the wisdom of the offensive increased. The French government desperately needed a victory to avoid civil unrest but the British were wary of proceeding, given the rapidly changing tactical situation. In a meeting with Lloyd George, French commander-in-chief General Robert Nivelle persuaded the British Prime Minister, that if the British launched a diversionary assault to draw German troops away from the Aisne sector, the French offensive could succeed. It was agreed in the London Convention of 16 January, that the French assault on the Aisne would begin in mid-April and that the British would make a diversionary attack in the Arras sector approximately one week prior. =Tactics: British Expeditionary Force= Troops of the 10th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers at Wagonlieu, 8 April 1917 Three of the armies of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig) were in the Arras sector, the Fifth Army (General Hubert Gough) in the south, the Third Army (General Edmund Allenby) in the centre and the First Army (General Henry Horne) in the north and the plan was devised by Allenby. The British used the lessons of the Somme and Verdun the previous year and planned to attack attacking on an front, from Vimy Ridge in the north to Neuville-Vitasse, south of the Scarpe river. The preliminary bombardment was planned to last about a week except for a much longer and heavier barrage at Vimy Ridge. Division attack training In December 1916, the training manual replaced of 8 May 1916 and marked a significant step in the evolution of the BEF into a homogeneous force, well adapted to its role on the Western Front. The duties of army, corps and divisions in planning attacks were standardised. Armies were to devise the plan and the principles of the artillery component. Corps were to allot tasks to divisions, which would then select objectives and devise infantry plans subject to corps approval. Artillery planning was controlled by corps with consultation of divisions by the corps General Officer Commanding, Royal Artillery (GOCRA) which became the title of the officer at each level of command who devised the bombardment plan, which was coordinated with neighbouring corps artillery commanders by the army GOCRA. Specific parts of the bombardment were nominated by divisions, using their local knowledge and the results of air reconnaissance. The corps artillery commander was to co-ordinate counter- battery fire and the howitzer bombardment for zero hour. Corps controlled the creeping barrage but divisions were given authority over extra batteries added to the barrage, which could be switched to other targets by the divisional commander and brigade commanders. provided the basis for the operational technique of the BEF for the rest of 1917. Platoon attack training The training manual of February 1917 marked the end of attacks made by lines of infantry with a few detached specialists. The platoon was divided into a small headquarters and four sections, one with two trained grenade-throwers and assistants, the second with a Lewis gunner and nine assistants carrying of ammunition, the third section comprised a sniper, scout and nine riflemen and the fourth section had nine men with four rifle-grenade launchers. The rifle and hand-grenade sections were to advance in front of the Lewis-gun and rifle- grenade sections, in two waves or in artillery formation, which covered an area wide and deep, with the four sections in a diamond pattern, the rifle section ahead, rifle grenade and bombing sections to the sides and the Lewis gun section behind, until resistance was met. German defenders were to be suppressed by fire from the Lewis-gun and rifle-grenade sections, while the riflemen and hand-grenade sections moved forward, preferably by infiltrating around the flanks of the resistance, to overwhelm the defenders from the rear. The changes in equipment, organisation and formation were elaborated in The Normal Formation For the Attack of February 1917, which recommended that the leading troops should push on to the final objective, when only one or two were involved but that for a greater number of objectives, when artillery covering fire was available for the depth of the intended advance, fresh platoons should \\"leap-frog\\" through the leading platoons to the next objective. The new organisations and equipment gave the infantry platoon the capacity for fire and manoeuvre, even in the absence of adequate artillery support. To bring uniformity in adoption of the methods laid down in the revised manuals and others produced over the winter, Haig established a BEF Training Directorate in January 1917, to issue manuals and oversee training. and its companion manuals provided British infantry with \\"off-the-peg\\" tactics, devised from the experience of the Somme and from French Army operations, to go with new equipment made available by increasing British and Allied war production and better understanding of the organisation necessary to exploit it in battle. =Tactics: German army= In a new manual published on 1 December 1916 by (OHL, supreme command of the German army), (Principles of Command for Defensive Battles in Positional Warfare), the policy of unyielding defence of ground, regardless of its tactical value, was replaced by the defence of positions suitable for artillery observation and communication with the rear, where an attacking force would \\"fight itself to a standstill and use up its resources while the defenders conserve[d] their strength\\". Defending infantry would fight in areas, with the front divisions in an outpost zone up to deep behind listening posts, with the main line of resistance placed on a reverse slope, in front of artillery observation posts, which were kept far enough back to retain observation over the outpost zone. Behind the main line of resistance was a (battle zone), a second defensive area deep, on ground hidden from enemy observation, as far as possible while in view of German artillery observers. A (rear battle zone) further back was to be occupied by the reserve battalion of each regiment. (Principles of Field Fortification) was published by OHL in January 1917 and by April an outpost zone () held by sentries, had been built along the Western Front. Sentries could retreat to larger positions () held by (five men and an NCO per ), who would join the sentries to recapture sentry-posts by immediate counter-attack. Defensive procedures in the battle zone were similar but with bigger units. The front trench system was the sentry line for the battle zone garrison, which was allowed to move away from concentrations of enemy fire and then counter-attack to recover the battle and outpost zones; such withdrawals were envisaged as occurring on small parts of the battlefield which had been made untenable by Allied artillery fire, as the prelude to (immediate counter- attack within the position). Such a decentralised battle by large numbers of small infantry detachments would present the attacker with unforeseen obstructions. Resistance from troops equipped with automatic weapons, supported by observed artillery fire, would increase the further the advance progressed. A school was opened in January 1917 to teach infantry commanders the new methods. Given the growing Allied superiority in munitions and manpower, attackers might still penetrate to the second (artillery protection line), leaving in their wake German garrisons isolated in resistance nests () still inflicting losses and disorganisation on the attackers. As the attackers tried to capture the and dig in near the German second line, and of the counter-attack divisions would advance from the into the battle zone, in an immediate counter-attack (). If the immediate counter-attack failed, counter- attack divisions would take their time to prepare a methodical attack, provided the lost ground was essential to the retention of the main position. Such methods required large numbers of reserve divisions ready to move to the battlefront. The reserve was obtained by creating by internal reorganisation of the army, bringing divisions from the eastern front and by shortening the Western Front, in Operation Alberich. By the spring of 1917, the German army in the west had a strategic reserve of German 6th Army Experience of the German 1st Army in the Somme Battles, () was published on 30 January 1917 by Ludendorff but new defensive methods were controversial. During the Battle of the Somme in 1916 Colonel Fritz von Lo√überg (Chief of Staff of the 1st Army) had been able to establish a line of relief divisions (), with the reinforcements from Verdun, which began to arrive in greater numbers in September. In his analysis of the battle, Lo√überg opposed the granting of discretion to front trench garrisons to retire, as he believed that manoeuvre would not evade Allied artillery fire, which could blanket the forward area and invited French or British infantry to occupy vacant areas. Lo√überg considered that spontaneous withdrawals would disrupt the counter-attack reserves as they deployed and further deprive battalion and division commanders of the means to conduct an organised defence, which the dispersal of infantry over a wide area had already made difficult. Lo√überg and others had severe doubts as to the ability of relief divisions to arrive on the battlefield in time to conduct an immediate counter-attack () from behind the battle zone. Sceptics wanted the tactic of fighting in the front line to continue, with authority devolved no further than battalion, to maintain organizational coherence in anticipation of a methodical counter-attack () by the relief divisions after Ludendorff was sufficiently impressed by Lo√überg's memorandum to add it to the new Manual of Infantry Training for War. General Ludwig von Falkenhausen, commander of the 6th Army arranged the infantry at Arras for the rigid defence of the front-line, supported by methodical counter-attacks (), by the \\"relief\\" divisions () on the second or third day. Five were placed behind Douai, away from the front line. The new Hindenburg line ended at Telegraph Hill between Neuville-Vitasse and Tilloy lez Mofflaines, from whence the original system of four lines apart, ran north to the Neuville St. Vaast‚ÄìBailleul-aux-Cornailles road. About behind were the Wancourt‚ÄìFeuchy and to the north the Point du Jour lines, running from the Scarpe river north along the east slope of Vimy ridge. The new Wotan line, which extended the Hindenburg position, was built around further back and not entirely mapped by the Allies until the battle had begun. Just before the battle, Falkenhausen had written that parts of the front line might be lost but the five could be brought forward to relieve the front divisions on the evening of the second day. On 6 April, General Karl von Nagel, the 6th Army Chief of Staff, accepted that some of the front divisions might need to be relieved on the first evening of battle but that any penetrations would be repulsed with local immediate counter-attacks () by the front divisions. On 7 April, Nagel viewed the imminent British attack as a limited effort against Vimy ridge, preparatory to a bigger attack later, perhaps combined with the French attack expected in mid-April. Construction of positions to fulfil the new policy of area defence had been drastically curtailed by shortages of labour and the long winter, which affected the setting of concrete. The 6th Army commanders had also been reluctant to encourage the British to change their plans if the British detected a thinning of the front line. The Germans were inhibited by the extent of British air reconnaissance, which observed new field works and promptly directed artillery fire on them. The 6th Army failed to redeploy its artillery, which remained in lines easy to see and bombard. Work on defences was also divided between maintaining the front line, strengthening the third line and the new (Drocourt‚ÄìQu√©ant switch line) further back. Prelude =British preparations= Underground After the Allied conference at Chantilly, Haig issued instructions for army commanders on 17 November 1916, with a general plan for offensive operations in the spring of 1917. The Chief engineer of the Third Army, Major-General E. R. Kenyon, composed a list of requirements by 19 November, for which he had 16 Army Troops companies, five with each corps in the front line and one with XVIII Corps, four tunnelling companies, three entrenching battalions, eight RE labour battalions and 37 labour companies. Inside the old walls of Arras were the Grand and Petit places, under which there were old cellars, which were emptied and refurbished for the accommodation of 13,000 men. Under the suburbs of St Sauveur and Ronville were many caves, some huge, which were rediscovered by accident in October 1916. When cleared out, the caves had room for 11,500 men, one in the Ronville system housing 4,000 men. The Crinchon sewer followed the ditch of the old fortifications and tunnels were dug from the cellars to the sewer. Two long tunnels were excavated from the Crinchon sewer, one through the St Sauveur and one through the Ronville system, allowing the 24,500 troops safely sheltered from German bombardment to move forward underground, avoiding the railway station, an obvious target for bombardment. The St Sauveur tunnel followed the line of the road to Cambrai and had five shafts in no man's land but the German retirement to the Hindenburg Line forestalled the use of the Ronville tunnels, when the German front line was withdrawn and there was no time to extend the diggings. The subterranean workings were lit by electricity and supplied by piped water, with gas-proof doors at the entrances; telephone cables, exchanges and testing-points used the tunnels, a hospital was installed and a tram ran from the sewer to the St Sauveur caves. The observation post for the VI Corps heavy artillery off the St Sauveur tunnel, had a telephone exchange with 750 circuits; much of the work in this area being done by the New Zealand Tunnelling Company. On the First Army front German sappers also conducted underground operations, seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter-mine, in which 41 New Zealand tunnellers were killed and 151 wounded.New Zealand Defence Force press release The British tunnellers had gained an advantage over the German miners by the Autumn of 1916, which virtually ended the German underground threat. The British turned to digging 12 subways about down, to the front line, the longest tunnel being long of the dug. In one sector, four Tunnelling companies of 500 men each, worked around-the-clock in 18-hour shifts for two months to dig of subways for foot traffic, tramways with rails for hand-drawn trolleys and a light railway system. Most tunnels were lit by electricity, accommodated telephone cables and some had trams and water supplies. Caverns were dug into the sides for brigade and battalion HQs, first aid posts and store-rooms. The subways were found to be a most efficient way to relieve troops in the line, form up for the attack and then to evacuate wounded. Some of the tunnels were continued into Russian saps with exits in mine craters in no man's land and new mines were laid. Galleries were dug to be opened after the attack for communication or cable trenches, the work being done by the 172nd, 176th, 182nd and 185th Tunnelling companies (Lieutenant-Colonel G. C. Williams, Controller of Mines First Army). War in the air Although the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) entered the battle with inferior aircraft to the Luftstreitkr√§fte, this did not deter their commander, General Trenchard, from adopting an offensive posture. Dominance of the air over Arras was essential for reconnaissance and the British carried out many aerial patrols. RFC aircraft carried out artillery spotting, photography of trench systems and bombing. Aerial observation was hazardous work as, for best results, the aircraft had to fly at slow speeds and low altitude over the German defences. It became even more dangerous with the arrival of the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen in March 1917. The presence of Jasta 11 led to sharply increased losses of Allied pilots and April 1917, became known as Bloody April. A German infantry officer later wrote, The average flying life of a RFC pilot in Arras in April was 18 hours and from 4‚Äì8 April, the RFC lost 75 aircraft and 105 aircrew. The casualties created a pilot shortage and replacements were sent to the front straight from flying school; during the same period, 56 aircraft were crashed by inexperienced RFC pilots. =Artillery= To keep enemy action to a minimum during the assault, a creeping barrage was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres in advance of the assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and the Battle of the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high- explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the barrage. The principal danger to assaulting troops came from enemy artillery fire as they crossed no man's land, accounting for over half the casualties at the first day of the Somme. A further complication was the location of German artillery, hidden as it was behind the ridges. In response, specialist artillery units were created to attack German artillery. Their targets were provided by 1st Field Survey Company, Royal Engineers, who collated data obtained from flash spotting and sound ranging. (Flash spotting required Royal Flying Corps observers to record the location of telltale flashes made by guns whilst firing.) On Zero-Day, 9 April, over 80 per cent of German heavy guns in the sector were neutralised (that is, \\"unable to bring effective fire to bear, the crews being disabled or driven off\\") by counter-battery fire. Gas shells were also used against the draught horses of the batteries and to disrupt ammunition supply columns. Tanks Forty tanks of the 1st Brigade were to be used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be attacked by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, the tanks still running were to drive to rally points. Battle =First phase= The preliminary bombardment of Vimy Ridge started on 20 March; and the bombardment of the rest of the sector on 4 April. Limited to a front of only , the bombardment used 2,689,000 shells, over a million more than had been used on the Somme. German casualties were not heavy but the men became exhausted by the endless task of keeping open dug-out entrances and demoralised by the absence of rations caused by the difficulties of preparing and moving hot food under bombardment. Some went without food altogether for two or three consecutive days. By the eve of battle, the front-line trenches had ceased to exist and their barbed wire defences were blown to pieces. The official history of the 2nd Bavarian Reserve Regiment describes the front line as \\"consisting no longer of trenches but of advanced nests of men scattered about\\". The 262nd Reserve Regiment history writes that its trench system was \\"lost in a crater field\\". To add to the misery, for the last ten hours of bombardment, gas shells were added. Zero-Hour had originally been planned for the morning of 8 April (Easter Sunday) but it was postponed 24 hours at the request of the French, despite reasonably good weather in the assault sector. Zero-Day was rescheduled for 9 April with Zero-Hour at 05:30. The assault was preceded by a hurricane bombardment lasting five minutes, following a relatively quiet night. When the time came, it was snowing heavily; Allied troops advancing across no man's land were hindered by large drifts. It was still dark and visibility on the battlefield was very poor. A westerly wind was at the Allied soldiers' backs blowing \\"a squall of sleet and snow into the faces of the Germans\\". The combination of the unusual bombardment and poor visibility meant many German troops were caught unawares and taken prisoner, still half-dressed, clambering out of the deep dug-outs of the first two lines of trenches. Others were captured without their boots, trying to escape but stuck in the knee-deep mud of the communication trenches. First Battle of the Scarpe (9‚Äì14 April 1917) The major British assault of the first day was directly east of Arras, with the 12th Division attacking Observation Ridge, north of the Arras‚ÄîCambrai road. After reaching this objective, they were to push on towards Feuchy, as well as the second and third lines of German trenches. At the same time, elements of the 3rd Division began an assault south of the road, with the taking of Devil's Wood, Tilloy-l√®s-Mofflaines and the Bois des Boeufs as their initial objectives. The ultimate objective of these assaults was the Monchyriegel, a trench running between Wancourt and Feuchy and an important component of the German defences. Most of these objectives, including Feuchy village, had been achieved by the evening of 10 April though the Germans were still in control of large sections of the trenches between Wancourt and Feuchy, particularly in the area of the heavily fortified village of Neuville-Vitasse. The following day, troops from the 56th Division were able to force the Germans out of the village, although the Monchyriegel was not fully in British hands until a few days later. The British were able to consolidate these gains and push forward towards Monchy-le-Preux, although they suffered heavy casualties in fighting near the village. One reason for the success of the offensive in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April. Battle of Vimy Ridge (9‚Äì12 April 1917) At roughly the same time, in perhaps the most carefully crafted portion of the entire offensive, the Canadian Corps launched an assault on Vimy Ridge. Advancing behind a creeping barrage and making heavy use of machine guns ‚Äì eighty to each brigade, including one Lewis gun in each platoon ‚Äì the corps was able to advance through about of German defences and captured the crest of the ridge at about 13:00. Military historians have attributed the success of this attack to careful planning by Canadian Corps commander Julian Byng and his subordinate General Arthur Currie, constant training and the assignment of specific objectives to each platoon. By giving units specific goals, troops could continue the attack even if their officers were killed or communication broke down, thus bypassing two major problems of combat on the Western Front. The Canadian troops could see the Germans in retreat across the Douai Plain away from the ridge. There was nevertheless an inflexibility to the plan which prevented the leading troops from continuing the advance and on 10 April the Germans began to stop the gaps with reserves. =Second phase= After the territorial gains of the first two days, a lull followed as the immense logistical support needed to keep armies in the field caught up with the new realities. Battalions of pioneers built temporary roads across the churned up battlefield; heavy artillery (and its ammunition) was manhandled into position in new gun pits; food for the men and feed for the draught horses was brought up and casualty clearing stations were established in readiness for the inevitable counter-attacks. Allied commanders also faced a dilemma: whether to keep their exhausted divisions on the attack and run the risk of having insufficient manpower or replace them with fresh divisions and lose momentum. In London, The Times printed, The Berlin Vossische Zeitung, wrote: \\"We have to count on reverses like that near Arras. Such events are a kind of tactical reverse. If this tactical reverse is not followed by strategical effects i.e., breaking through on the part of the aggressor, then the whole battle is nothing but a weakening of the attacked party in men and materiel.\\" The same day, the Frankfurter Zeitung commented: \\"If the British succeed in breaking through it will render conditions worse for them as it will result in freedom of operations which is Germany's own special art of war\\". General Ludendorff was less sanguine. The news of the battle reached him during his 52nd birthday celebrations at his headquarters in Kreuznach. He wrote: \\"I had looked forward to the expected offensive with confidence and was now deeply depressed\\". He telephoned each of his commanders and \\"gained the impression that the principles laid down by OHL were sound but the whole art of leadership lies in applying them correctly\\". (A later court of inquiry would establish that Falkenhausen had indeed misunderstood the principles of defence in depth.) Ludendorff immediately ordered reinforcements. Then, on 11 April, he sacked Falkenhausen's chief of staff and replaced him with Lo√überg. Lo√überg went armed with vollmacht (a power of command enabling him to issue orders in the army commander's name), replacing Falkenhausen. Within hours of arriving, Lo√überg began to restructure the German defences. The British aimed to consolidate the gains made in the first days of the offensive, to keep the initiative and to break through in concert with the French at Aisne. From 16 April, it was apparent that the French part of the Nivelle Offensive on the Aisne had not achieved a breakthrough. Haig continued to attack at Arras, to continue to divert troops from the French on the Aisne. Second Battle of the Scarpe (23‚Äì24 April 1917) At 04:45 on 23 April, following two days of poor visibility and freezing weather, British troops of the Third Army (VI and VII corps), attacked to the east along an approximate front from Croisilles to Gavrelle on both sides of the Scarpe. The 51st Division attacked on the northern side in heavy fighting on the western outskirts of Roeux Wood and the chemical works. On their left, the 37th Division, attacked the buildings west of Roeux Station and gained the line of their objectives on the western slopes of Greenland Hill, north of the railway. On the left of the main British attack the 63rd Division, made rapid progress against Gavrelle and secured the village. To the south of the Scarpe and east of Monchy-le-Preux the 29th Division gained the western slopes of the rising ground known as Infantry Hill. The Cojeul river marked a divisional boundary within the VI Corps. Gu√©mappe on the north side of the river was the objective of the 15th Division, attacking east from Wancourt towards Vis-en- Artois. The objective was commanded by the higher ground on the south bank and it was not until the 50th Division captured the rise on the south side of the Cojeul that the village was taken. Several determined German counter-attacks were made and by the morning of 24 April, the British held Gu√©mappe, Gavrelle and the high ground overlooking Fontaine-lez-Croisilles and Cherisy; the fighting around Roeux was indecisive. Battle of Arleux (28‚Äì29 April 1917) The principal objective of the attack was the need to sustain a supporting action tying down German reserves to assist the French offensive against the plateau north of the Aisne traversed by the Chemin des Dames. Haig reported, At 04:25 on 28 April, British and Canadian troops launched the main attack on a front of about north of Monchy-le-Preux. The battle continued for most of 28 and 29 April, with the Germans delivering determined counter- attacks. The British positions at Gavrelle were attacked seven times with strong forces and on each occasion the German thrust was repulsed with great loss by the 63rd Division. The village of Arleux-en-Gohelle was captured by the 1st Canadian Division after hand-to-hand fighting and the 2nd Division (Major-General C. E. Pereira), made further progress in the neighbourhood of Oppy, Greenland Hill (37th Division) and between Monchy-le-Preux and the Scarpe (12th Division). Third Battle of the Scarpe (3‚Äì4 May 1917) After securing the area around Arleux at the end of April, the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to try to break through the Boiry Riegel and reach the Wotanstellung, a major German defensive fortification. This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two‚Äìpronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. With this objective in mind, the British launched another attack using regiments from the 4th Division near the Scarpe on 3 May. However, neither prong was able to make any significant advances and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties. Although this battle was a failure, the British learned important lessons about the need for close liaison between tanks, infantry and artillery, which they would use in the Battle of Cambrai, 1917. Flanking operations (Round Bullecourt, 11 April ‚Äì 16 June) =First attack on Bullecourt= 8‚Äì10 April The Hindenburg Line defences enclosing the village of Bullecourt formed a re-entrant for about to the (Balcony Trench) around Qu√©ant, defended by the German 27th Division. On 8 April it was announced that wire cutting, begun on 5 April, would take another eight days. At dusk on 9 April, patrols went forward and found that the Hindenburg Line was occupied but that the wire cutting bombardment had made several lanes through the wire. Preparations were made in a rush, the 4th Australian Division to attack with two brigades, the 4th on the right and 12th on the left. The attack had to cover to the wire and another to the first trench at about an hour and 48 minutes before the sun rose to evade crossfire in the re-entrant between Qu√©ant and Bullecourt. Artillery-fire would continue as normal until zero hour then maintain barrages ion the flanks. At Bullecourt was subjected to a gas bombardment by Livens projectors and Stokes 4-inch mortars as the Australians assembled and waited for the tanks to arrive. Six battalions were out in the snow of no man's land. The left of the 12th Australian Brigade was only from Bullecourt and dawn was approaching. Zero hour was put back but the tanks had only reached Noreuil and Holmes ordered the infantry back under cover; snow began to fall again and shielded the retirement. Patrols of the 2/7th and 2/8th battalions, West Yorkshire Regiment began to advance from and at the patrols began to retire. The patrols suffered 11 April At a conference at the 4th Australian Division HQ, it was decided that the infantry would advance fifteen minutes after the tanks, rather than wait on a signal from them. Only four tanks reached their start line by but drowning the sound of their engines with machine-gun fire failed and they were heard in the German defences. The tank on the right flank deviated to the right, suffered mechanical difficulties and returned to the railway. Another tank also veered right and crossed the first trench of the opposite Grenadier Regiment 123 and was knocked out by machine- guns firing armour-piercing (K bullet) ammunition. The next tank to reach the German lines was snagged by wire, then crossed the first trench before being knocked out. The last tank started late followed a similar path to the first. The four tanks comprising the left-hand section were late and two were knocked out short of the German trenches; the third tank arrived behind the Australian infantry and silenced a machine-gun in Bullecourt. The tank was hit twice, returned to the railway and was hit again. The Australian infantry in the German defences were cut off and the 4th Australian Brigade was forced back and many were taken prisoner, those who tried to retreat suffered many more casualties. In the 12th Australian Brigade, the 46th Australian Battalion in the first trench was forced out and the 48th Australian Battalion further forward was surrounded. The artillery of the 2nd Guard Division and 220th Division added to the barrage in no man's land and prevented another Australian attack. As the Australians were being forced back, they were unable to salvage ammunition and grenades from the dead and wounded. The British and Australian artillery had eventually begun to fire but this fell on the Australian-occupied trenches, making them untenable. At the 48th Australian Battalion, the last in the German trenches, made an orderly retreated over the bullet-swept ground. By noon the German counter-attack had succeeded; few Australians had managed to re-cross no man's land through artillery and machine-gun fire. =German attack on Lagnicourt (15 April 1917)= Observing that the 1st Australian Division was holding a frontage of , the local German corps commander General Otto von Moser, commanding (XIV Reserve Corps) planned a spoiling attack to drive back the advanced posts, destroy supplies and guns and then retire to the Hindenburg defences. OHL had added an extra division to his and added two more from to the south, further to strengthen the attack. The four divisions provided 23 battalions for (Operation Battering Ram). The German forces managed to penetrate the Australian front line at the junction on the 1st Australian Division and 2nd Australian Division, occupying the village of Lagnicourt and destroyed six Australian artillery pieces. Counter- attacks from the 9th and 20th Australian battalions restored the front line and the action ended with the Germans having suffered and the Australians . =Battle of Bullecourt (3‚Äì17 May 1917)= After the initial assault around Bullecourt failed to penetrate the German lines, British commanders made preparations for a second attempt. British artillery began an intense bombardment of the village, which by 20 April had been virtually destroyed. Although the infantry assault was planned for 20 April, it was pushed back a number of times and finally set for the early morning of 3 May. At 03:45, elements of the 2nd Australian Division attacked east of Bullecourt village, intending to pierce the Hindenburg Line and capture Hendecourt-l√®s-Cagnicourt, while British troops from the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division attacked Bullecourt, which was finally taken by the British 7th Division and despite determined effort by the Germans was held by the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division. German resistance was fierce and when the offensive was called off on 17 May, few of the initial objectives had been met. The Australians were in possession of much of the German trench system between Bullecourt and Riencourt-l√®s-Cagnicourt but had been unable to capture Hendecourt. To the west, British troops managed to push the Germans out of Bullecourt but incurred considerable losses, failing also to advance north-east to Hendecourt. Aftermath =Analysis= By the standards of the Western Front, the gains of the first two days were nothing short of spectacular. A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties and a number of tactically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge. The offensive drew German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector. In many respects, the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies but these gains were offset by high casualties after the first two days and the failure of the French offensive at the Aisne. By the end of the offensive, the British had suffered more than 150,000 casualties and gained little ground since the first day. Despite significant early gains, they were unable to break through and the situation reverted to stalemate. Although historians generally consider the battle a British victory, in the wider context of the front, it had very little impact on the strategic or tactical situation. Ludendorff later commented \\"no doubt exceedingly important strategic objects lay behind the British attack but I have never been able to discover what they were\\". Ludendorff was also \\"very depressed; had our principles of defensive tactics proved false and if so, what was to be done?\\" =Awards= On the Allied side, twenty-five Victoria Crosses were awarded. On the German side, on 24 April 1917, Kaiser Wilhelm awarded Lo√überg the Oakleaves (similar to a bar for a repeat award) for the Pour le M√©rite he had received at the Battle of the Somme the previous September.Pour le M√©rite online archive =Casualties= The most quoted Allied casualty figures are those in the returns made by Lieutenant-General Sir George Fowke, Haig's adjutant-general. His figures collate the daily casualty tallies kept by each unit under Haig's command.Preserved at the British Public Record Office Third Army casualties were 87,226; First Army 46,826 (including 11,004 Canadians at Vimy Ridge); and Fifth Army 24,608; totalling 158,660. German losses are more difficult to determine. Gruppe Vimy and Gruppe Souchez suffered 79,418 casualties but the figures for Gruppe Arras are incomplete. The writers of the German Official History Der Weltkrieg, recorded losses to the end of April and another by the end of May, a total of and casualties. German records excluded those \\"lightly wounded\\". Captain Cyril Falls (the writer of the Official History volume on the battle) estimated that 30 per cent needed to be added to German returns for comparison with the British. Falls made \\"a general estimate\\" that German casualties were \\"probably fairly equal\\". Nicholls puts them at 120,000 and Keegan at 130,000. =Commanders= Although Haig paid tribute to Allenby for the plan's \\"great initial success\\", Allenby's subordinates \\"objected to the way he handled the ... attritional stage\\". Allenby was sent to command the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Palestine. He regarded the transfer as a \\"badge of failure\\", but he \\"more than redeemed his reputation by defeating\\" the Ottomans in battles that were fought in the Sinai and Palestine campaign in 1917‚Äì18. Haig stayed in his post until the end of the war. When the failures of the 6th Army command became apparent, Ludendorff removed Falkenhausen (who never held a field command again, spending the rest of the war as Governor-General of Belgium) and several staff officers. In early 1918, The Times carried an article, Falkenhausen's Reign of Terror, describing 170 military executions of Belgian civilians since he had been appointed governor. Ludendorff and Lo√überg discovered that although the Allies were capable of breaking through the first position, they could probably not capitalise on their success if they were confronted by a mobile, clever defence. Ludendorff immediately ordered more training in manoeuvre warfare for the Eingreif divisions. Lo√überg was soon promoted to general and directed the defensive battle of the 4th Army against the Flanders Offensive of the summer and late autumn; he had become \\"legendary as the fireman of the Western Front; always sent by OHL to the area of crisis\\". =War poetry and music= Siegfried Sassoon makes reference to the battle in the poem The General. The Anglo-Welsh lyric poet Edward Thomas was killed by a shell on 9 April 1917, during the first day of the Easter Offensive. Thomas's war diary gives a vivid and poignant picture of life on the Western front in the months leading up to the battle. The composer Ernest John Moeran was wounded during the attack on Bullecourt on 3 May 1917. References =Notes= =Footnotes= =Bibliography= Books           * New Zealand Defence Force.

Lucien Rosengart at his work table by Edouard Vuillard His early life was shaped by carriages and the advance of the automobile age. He first started working as a mechanic at the age of 12, and by age 24 he had a machine shop in Belleville and several patents to his credit. By 1914 his products included railway parts, bicycle parts, and a rocket that allowed artillery shells to be exploded while airborne. This attracted the attention of the French Government and they set him up with two factories, one in Paris and one in Saint-Brieuc - at this point he began working with Andre Citro√´n's company, which provided the shells. By the end of the first world war, he'd become a skilled businessman and helped both Peugeot and Citro√´n stave off bankruptcy. Involvement with these companies led Rosengart to think of building his own car. He was already making bicycles. Automobiles L. Rosengart Rosengart LR4 1928 The Rosengart LR2 Rosengart Cabriolet 1930 The Rosengart LR4n In 1927, he saw the opportunity to produce a very small car for a segment of the market in France that was not at that time being covered by any of the major players. He bought the old Bellanger factory at Neuilly. The early Rosengart cars were licensed copies of the British Austin 7. This model, the LR2, was dressed up in various ways using various styling techniques and remained in production for quite some time - surviving as the vastly facelifted LR4 and Vivor long after the British car had been consigned to history. In the early 1930s Rosengart teamed up with the German manufacturer Adler, offering license built copies of the Adler Trumpf and Trumpf Junior, small front-drive cars that bolstered its range. It also added a conventional rear-driven car along the lines of a stretched and widened Austin. The development of front-wheel drive models led to the elegant Supertraction model in 1937 - which competed with larger cars like the Peugeot 402 and the Berliet Dauphine for the first time in Rosengart's short history. Belgian magazine Le Soir Illustre claimed in their November 1979 issue (No. 2471 on page 26) that the French inventor Lucien Rosengart (1880 ‚Äì 1976) came up with the game of table soccer in the 1930s when he was looking for things to keep his grandchildren entertained during the cold winter months. He called the game ‚Äúbabyfoot‚Äù instead of foosball.https://www.foosballrevolution.com/history/ In 1936 Rosengart himself was in financial difficulties so he transferred the company to a new organisation, Societ√© Industrielle de l'Ouest Parisien (SIOP). Unfortunately production of the Supertraction was never large, and the company was devastated by the Nazi invasion of France. The company was able to survive the German occupation of France until after the war but did not produce cars during the conflict. After the war Rosengart, who had been in the United States (while his son stayed in the south of France), tried to guide his company back to the small cars that had made it a success in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Unfortunately, the major manufacturers of France were by then making very small, economical cars that were very well suited to the conditions of post-war France. The last Rosengart car, the Ariette, was produced from 1947 to 1954, but failed to sell. The company closed its doors in the summer of 1955, after failing to launch its new car, the Sagaie, a development of the Ariette with a flat-twin engine. Lucien Rosengart died at his home near Nice.

He was an associate of both Eric Gill and G. K. Chesterton, working on publications in which they had an interest. He was also a founder with Gill and Desmond Chute in 1920 of a Catholic community of craftsmen at Ditchling, Sussex, called The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic. Life His background was Quaker.Keith Alldritt, David Jones: Writer and Artist (2003), p. 48. He was born at Eastbourne and educated at Bootham School.Oxford Dictionary of National BiographyHilary Pepler - CatholicAuthors.com In the early 1900s, Pepler moved to Hammersmith, London with his wife Clare Whiteman. Pepler became deeply involved in the aesthetic of the Arts and Crafts Movement and the politics of Fabianism. He became friends with Edward Johnston and, during World War I, met Eric Gill through the Hampshire House Workshops. At that time Pepler was a social worker for the London County Council, and organised the first London school meals service.Fiona MacCarthy, Eric Gill (1989), p. 65. Pepler and Gill were together mostly responsible for the Ditchling house magazine, The Game. In 1915, Pepler moved to Ditchling, where Gill had set up a commune of religious artists and artisans. There, he founded St. Dominic's Press, with the intention of printing books ‚Äúabout crafts which machinery threatened with extinction.‚Äù It published, amongst other books, important editions for the Ulysses Bookshop in High Holborn, London, owned by Jacob Schwartz, to 1937. These included works of James Joyce (in fact pirate editions), but also George Bernard Shaw, John Drinkwater, Augustus John, Chesterton and John Collier. He became a Roman Catholic convert in 1916; and joined the Dominicans as a lay member in 1918. At that time he changed his name to Hilary. Financial quarrels between Pepler and Gill may have led to Gill leaving the Ditchling group in 1924.Aldritt, p. 56. Dated also to 1925 Pepler was forced to leave the Guild in 1934.The Eric Gill Society: Guild Members After Chesterton's death in 1936, Pepler assisted Reginald Jebb, son-in-law of Hilaire Belloc, in running The Weekly Review, the successor distributist publication to G.

Lying within it is a continuation of the dura mater (one of the meninges) called the falx cerebri. The inner surfaces of the two hemispheres are convoluted by gyri and sulci just as is the outer surface of the brain.  Structure  = Falx cerebri = All three meninges of the cortex (dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater) fold and descend deep down into the longitudinal fissure, physically separating the two hemispheres. Falx cerebri is the name given to the dura mater in-between the two hemispheres, whose significance arises from the fact that it is the outermost layer of the meninges. These layers prevent any direct connectivity between the bilateral lobes of the cortex, thus requiring any tracts to pass through the corpus callosum. The vasculature of falx cerebri supplies blood to the innermost surfaces of the cortex, neighboring the midsagittal plane. = Cerebral asymmetry = Though this fissure divides the brain, the two hemispheres of the human cortex are not perfectly symmetrical, both in structure and in function. For example, the planum temporale, roughly corresponding to the Wernicke‚Äôs area, was found to be 10 times larger in the left than the right hemisphere.Jill B. Becker (2002). Behavioral Endocrinology 2e. MIT Press. pp. 103‚Äì. . Retrieved 4 January 2013. In contrast, the caudate nucleus, within the basal ganglia, was found to be larger in the right hemisphere.Watkins, K. (2001). Structural Asymmetries in the Human Brain: A Voxel-based Statistical Analysis of 142 MRI Scans. Cerebral Cortex, 11(9), 868-877. = Corpus callosum = The corpus callosum connects the two halves of the brain at the bottom of its structure and delivers visual, auditory, and somatosensory messages between each half. Here, billions of neurons and glia can be found working together to send messages that form what is known as the cerebral cortex. The corpus callosum is responsible for eye movement and visual perception, maintaining a balance between arousal and attention, and the ability to identify locations of sensory stimulation. In a clinical setting, those with epilepsy may benefit from the division of the corpus callosum.  Development  = Phylogenetically = It is thought that a majority of existing animals, including Homo sapiens, have evolved from a common wormlike ancestor that lived around 600 million years ago, called the urbilaterian. A bilaterian animal is one that has symmetrical left and right body halves. While it is still debated whether this species had a complex brain or not, development of similar species support the hypothesis that it had at least a simple anterior collection of nerve cells, called a cephalon.Hejnol, A., & Martindale, M. Q. (2008). Acoel development supports a simple planula-like urbilaterian. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,363(1496), 1493-1501. Furthermore, studies have shown that this cephalon was bilateral, consisting of two or more connected sub-collections that are separated by the mid-sagittal plane,Mayer, G., Whitington, P. M., Sunnucks, P., & Pfl√ºger, H. (2010). A revision of brain composition in Onychophora (velvet worms) suggests that the tritocerebrum evolved in arthropods. BMC Evolutionary Biology, 10, 255. suggesting the first example of such a division. = Ontogenetically = A neural crest appears in the mammalian embryo as soon as the 20th day of development. It is during embryonic development that a neural tube appears and is folded into a hollow structure, as shown in Figure 1. This process is also known as neurulation. The neural tube is where the central nervous system forms, which later on in development will be subdivided and differentiated into distinct sections of the brain and spinal cord. These subdivisions occur by signaling molecules that direct differentiated cells to their correct location of the organism. The bilateral sides of this structure then give rise to the two hemispheres of the Homo sapiens cortex but do not merge at any point besides the corpus callosum. As a result, the longitudinal fissure is formed.Purves, D., Augustine, G. J., Fitzpatrick, D., Hall, W. C., LaMantia, A., White, L. E., . . . Platt, M. L. (2018). Neuroscience. New York; Oxford: Sinauer Associates. The longitudinal fissure can appear as early as the eighth week of development, and distinctly separates the two hemispheres by around the tenth gestational week. 249x249px  Function  Essentially the fissure's purpose is to separate the brain into two hemispheres, left and right. Through case studies of brain damage or stroke to either side of each hemisphere, there is evidence that the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body, and the right side controlling the left side of the body.Marieb, Hoehn. Brain Anatomy. http://www.wou.edu/~lemastm/Teaching/BI335/Laboratory%2001%20-%20Brain%20Anatomy.pdf Stroke patients have been found to unilateral impairment following damage to either the left or right hemisphere, this effecting the opposite side of the body. Separating each hemisphere allows for specialization of storage, procedural and cognitive function. Through, \\"split-brain experiments\\", the left hemisphere is shown to specialize in mathematics, language and general logistics. The right hemisphere is further specialized, generally, in music, art, facial recognition and in most spatial events. The longitudinal fissure also pays a role in the optic nerve tract. This is shown in (figure 4.) with the optic chiasm, which takes the nerve from the right eye to the left hemisphere and the left eye to the right hemisphere. The longitudinal fissure allows for this misdirection and crossover of nerves. The crossover seems to be counterintuitive, however it does serve an adaptive purpose. This purpose is to give us stereopsis, (depth and three-dimensional vision), as well as a development of binocular vision. These two components combined give the ability to have a larger perceived visual field, which coincides with the hypothesis that this is an adaptive function given by the fissures placement and structure. Damage to the nerve past the optic chiasm, will cause loss or impairment to the corresponding eye. If the right side of the brain is damaged and the nerve is damaged or destroyed, then the left eye will also follow the severity of damage.  Clinical significance  The longitudinal fissure plays a key role in corpus callosotomy, neurosurgery resulting in split brain, as it provides unobstructed access to the corpus callosum. Corpus callosotomy is one of the procedures used for pharmacologically treating intractable epilepsy cases, and it consists of the division of the nerve fibers running between the two hemispheres through the corpus callosum. A neurosurgeon separates the two hemispheres physically by pulling them apart with special tools, and cuts through either approximately two thirds of the fibers in the case of partial callosotomy, or the entirety in the case of complete callosotomy. Without the presence of longitudinal fissure, the corpus callosotomy procedure would be significantly more challenging and dangerous, as it would require the surgeon to navigate through densely connected cortical areas. Following the procedure, the two hemispheres are no longer able to communicate with each other as before. While patients‚Äô brains usually adapt and allow for uninterrupted daily life, cognitive tests can easily determine whether a patient has split-brain. In an experiment involving a chimeric figure, with a woman‚Äôs face on the left half and a man‚Äôs face on the right half, a patient with split-brain focusing on the middle point will point to the woman‚Äôs face when prompted to point to the face in the picture, and will answer ‚Äúa man‚Äù if asked what the picture is depicting.Levy, J., Trevarthen, C., & Sperry, R. W. (1972). Perception Of Bilateral Chimeric Figures Following Hemispheric Deconnexion. Brain, 95(1), 61-78. This is because the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) is in the right hemisphere, while language centers are predominantly in the left hemisphere.Figure 2: Diffusion tensor imaging example = Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation = In studies, low- frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applications have been tested with various cognitive processes during time perception tasks. Studies have analyzed the effects of the low-frequency rTMS on tests of time perception when the rTMS has been applied to the \\"parietal medial longitudinal fissure\\". Findings have shown evidence to support the hypothesis that participants in this study would underestimate their perception of time for short amounts of time and overestimate for longer periods of time. Specifically, the 20 participants underestimated 1 second time intervals and overestimated 4 second/9 second intervals after applying 1-Hz rTMS. = Neurosurgery = The longitudinal fissure can serve as an effective surgical passage in the frontal bone during central and pterional craniotomies, which is opening into the skull by surgery.

The Anatomical Record : Advances in Integrative Anatomy and Evolutionary Biology., 298(9), 1612‚Äì1621. https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.23183}} While there are variations in the head shapes of many species, dogs have been found to have a high variation in terms of head shapes making it difficult to find a brain surgical procedure that will work effectively for them. One goal of the study was to distinguish the longitudinal cerebral fissure anatomy and their possible variations in brachy‚Äê(B), dolicho‚Äê(D) and mesaticephalic‚Äê(M) dogs. Even though the lateral cerebral fissure morphology was uniform in the dog breeds. Mesaticephalic‚Äê(M) dogs were found to have the greatest surgical passage resulting in access to more brain structures, while the dolicho‚Äê(D) dogs had the smallest surgical passage. Research Figure 3: Area of the corpus callosum in comparison with the longitudinal fissure surface areaAs the corpus callosum is substantially smaller in surface area relative to the longitudinal fissure (Figure 3), fiber bundles passing through are densely packed together, and precision tracking is essential to distinguish between the individual bundles that originate from and lead to the same cortical centers. Understanding such connections allows us to understand the contralateral concurrences and what diseases can result from lesions to them. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI or dMRI) along with fiber- tracking (FT) algorithms and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is used to image these bundles.Dougherty, R. F., Ben-Shachar, M., Bammer, R., Brewer, A. A., & Wandell, B. A. (2005). Functional organization of human occipital-callosal fiber tracts.

For instance, occipital-callosal fiber tracts were localized with 1‚Äì2 mm precision using DTI-TF techniques - which are very important for the cooperation of visual cortices, and any lesion to them can lead to alexia, the inability to read.

It is located in the posterior portion of the frontal lobe. Brodmann area 4 is part of the precentral gyrus. The borders of this area are: the precentral sulcus in front (anteriorly), the medial longitudinal fissure at the top (medially), the central sulcus in back (posteriorly), and the lateral sulcus along the bottom (laterally). This area of cortex, as shown by Wilder Penfield and others, has the pattern of a homunculus. That is, the legs and trunk fold over the midline; the arms and hands are along the middle of the area shown here; and the face is near the bottom of the figure. Because Brodmann area 4 is in the same general location as primary motor cortex, the homunculus here is called the motor homunculus. The term area 4 of Brodmann-1909 refers to a cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the frontal lobe of the guenon. It is located predominantly in the precentral gyrus. Brodmann-1909 regarded it as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the human gigantopyramidal area 4 and noted that it occupies a much greater fraction of the frontal lobe in the monkey than in the human. Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): the cortex is unusually thick; the layers are not distinct; the cells are relatively sparsely distributed; giant pyramidal (Betz) cells are present in the internal pyramidal layer (V); lack of an internal granular layer (IV) such that the boundary between the external pyramidal layer (III) and the internal pyramidal layer (V) is indistinct; lack of a distinct external granular layer (II); a gradual transition from the multiform layer (VI) to the subcortical white matter.

The boundary between the states of New York and New Jersey runs through the island, with a small portion on the north end of the island belonging to the cities of Bayonne and Elizabeth in New Jersey and the rest being part of the borough of Staten Island in New York City. Early history In colonial times Shooters Island was used as a hunting preserve. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington used the island as a drop-off point for messages, and the place became a haven for spies. Shipyard Graveyard, Vessel No. 53 is Jane Moseley built in 1873 renamed Minerva 1911‚Äì1932 Minerva in the boat basin circa 1936 The first shipyard on Shooters Island was created in 1860 by David Decker. From 1898 until 1910, the island was home to a major shipyard, the Townsend-Downey Shipbuilding Company. Theodore E. Ferris, who later designed the eponymous ships used by the American government in World War I, was an employee of the firm. Around this time it was also home to the Standard Shipbuilding Company, which bought the island in 1915. The entire island was occupied by buildings, including a foundry, pattern shop, and offices. There were major docks and shipways that faced to the east. Contrary to a previous report, President Theodore Roosevelt did not go hunting on this industrial island. The Townsend-Downey Company built a yacht, , for Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. Its launch in February 1902 was attended by many hundreds of spectators, including Pres. Theodore Roosevelt and Prince Henry of Prussia. Alice Roosevelt, the president's daughter, christened the boat. Thomas Alva Edison sent a cameraman who made one of the first news movies of the event. It is available online from the Library of Congress. The next day a reception was held at the White House for Mr. Downey and representatives of the German Government. The following year the fast three-masted schooner was launched at the yard. In 1905, it raced across the Atlantic and won the Kaiser's cup and set a record for the crossing under sail which stood unbroken for almost 90 years. Another famous vessel built on Shooter's Island was , built for the Carnegie Institution of Washington for use in magnetic surveys in the Pacific Ocean. The brigantine yacht was named after industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who was a friend of Mr. Downey. It was built entirely of wood and nonmagnetic metals so as not to interfere with magnetic measurements. The island came under the control of the Tidewater Oil Company in 1903. In 1905, the eight building plant and its 33 acres were purchased by the Colonial Trust Company for $516,000. At the time, the shipyard was valued at two million dollars. The island was used for industrial and shipbuilding operations through 1922. Abandoned vessels began to accumulate around the perimeter of the island by 1930. Bird sanctuary Neglected during much of the later 20th century, the island has been made an official bird sanctuary, partially to discourage the United States Army Corps of Engineers who wanted to blow up the island to ease navigation by vessels coming down from Port Newark. It has begun to disintegrate into Newark Bay. The island and decayed remnants of old piers are visible to users of the Bayonne Bridge between Staten Island and Bayonne, New Jersey. The remains of the once active shipyard are still present, but diminishing every year. Shooters Island began to support nesting wading birds, cormorants and gulls in the early 1970s. At its peak in 1995, the island supported 400 nesting pairs of herons, egrets, ibis and 121 nesting pairs of double-crested cormorants. The island is now owned by the City of New York and is maintained by New York City Department of Parks and Recreation as a bird sanctuary.Parsons, K. and B. Wright. 1995.

For comparison, the sociology of knowledge studies the impact of human knowledge and the prevailing ideas on societies and relations between knowledge and the social context within which it arises. Sociologists of scientific knowledge study the development of a scientific field and attempt to identify points of contingency or interpretative flexibility where ambiguities are present. Such variations may be linked to a variety of political, historical, cultural or economic factors. Crucially, the field does not set out to promote relativism or to attack the scientific project; the objective of the researcher is to explain why one interpretation rather than another succeeds due to external social and historical circumstances. The field emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and at first was an almost exclusively British practice. Other early centers for the development of the field were in France, Germany, and the United States (notably at Cornell University). Major theorists include Barry Barnes, David Bloor, Sal Restivo, Randall Collins, Gaston Bachelard, Harry Collins, Karin Knorr Cetina, Paul Feyerabend, Steve Fuller, Martin Kusch, Bruno Latour, Mike Mulkay, Derek J. de Solla Price, Lucy Suchman and Anselm Strauss. Programmes and schools The sociology of scientific knowledge in its Anglophone versions emerged in the 1970s in self-conscious opposition to the sociology of science associated with the American Robert K. Merton, generally considered one of the seminal authors in the sociology of science. Merton's was a kind of \\"sociology of scientists,\\" which left the cognitive content of science out of sociological account; SSK by contrast aimed at providing sociological explanations of scientific ideas themselves, taking its lead from aspects of the work of Thomas S. Kuhn, but especially from established traditions in cultural anthropology (Durkheim, Mauss) as well as the late Wittgenstein. David Bloor, one of SSK's early champions, has contrasted the so-called 'weak programme' (or 'program'‚Äîeither spelling is used) which merely gives social explanations for erroneous beliefs, with what he called the 'strong programme', which considers sociological factors as influencing all beliefs. The weak programme is more of a description of an approach than an organised movement. The term is applied to historians, sociologists and philosophers of science who merely cite sociological factors as being responsible for those beliefs that went wrong. Imre Lakatos and (in some moods) Thomas S. Kuhn might be said to adhere to it. The strong programme is particularly associated with the work of two groups: the 'Edinburgh School' (David Bloor, Barry Barnes, and their colleagues at the Science Studies Unit at the University of Edinburgh) in the 1970s and '80s, and the 'Bath School' (Harry Collins and others at the University of Bath) in the same period. \\"Edinburgh sociologists\\" and \\"Bath sociologists\\" promoted, respectively, the Strong Programme and Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR). Also associated with SSK in the 1980s was discourse analysis as applied to science (associated with Michael Mulkay at the University of York), as well as a concern with issues of reflexivity arising from paradoxes relating to SSK's relativist stance towards science and the status of its own knowledge-claims (Steve Woolgar, Malcolm Ashmore). The sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) has major international networks through its principal associations, 4S and EASST, with recently established groups in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Latin America. It has made major contributions in recent years to a critical analysis of the biosciences and informatics. The sociology of mathematical knowledge Studies of mathematical practice and quasi-empiricism in mathematics are also rightly part of the sociology of knowledge since they focus on the community of those who practice mathematics and their common assumptions. Since Eugene Wigner raised the issue in 1960 and Hilary Putnam made it more rigorous in 1975, the question of why fields such as physics and mathematics should agree so well has been debated. Proposed solutions point out that the fundamental constituents of mathematical thought, space, form-structure, and number- proportion are also the fundamental constituents of physics. It is also worthwhile to note that physics is nothing but modeling of reality, and seeing causal relationships governing repeatable observed phenomena, and much of mathematics, especially in relation to the growth of the calculus, has been developed precisely for the goal of developing these models in a rigorous fashion. Another approach is to suggest that there is no deep problem, that the division of human scientific thinking through using words such as 'mathematics' and 'physics' is only useful in their practical everyday function to categorize and distinguish. Fundamental contributions to the sociology of mathematical knowledge have been made by Sal Restivo and David Bloor. Restivo draws upon the work of scholars such as Oswald Spengler (The Decline of the West, 1918), Raymond Louis Wilder and Leslie Alvin White, as well as contemporary sociologists of knowledge and science studies scholars. David Bloor draws upon Ludwig Wittgenstein and other contemporary thinkers. They both claim that mathematical knowledge is socially constructed and has irreducible contingent and historical factors woven into it. More recently Paul Ernest has proposed a social constructivist account of mathematical knowledge, drawing on the works of both of these sociologists. Criticism SSK has received criticism from theorists of the actor-network theory (ANT) school of science and technology studies. These theorists criticise SSK for sociological reductionism and a human centered universe. SSK, they say, relies too heavily on human actors and social rules and conventions settling scientific controversies. The debate is discussed in an article Epistemological Chicken.Collins, H. M. and S. Yearley (1992). \\"Epistemological Chicken\\". In A. Pickering (Ed.) Science as Practice and Culture. Chicago, Chicago University Press: 301-326.

They took place principally in the United States in the 1990s in the academic and mainstream press. Scientific realists (such as Norman Levitt, Paul R. Gross, Jean Bricmont and Alan Sokal) argued that scientific knowledge is real, and accused the postmodernists of having effectively rejected scientific objectivity, the scientific method, empiricism, and scientific knowledge. Postmodernists interpreted Thomas Kuhn's ideas about scientific paradigms to mean that scientific theories are social constructs, and philosophers like Paul Feyerabend argued that other, non- realist forms of knowledge production were better suited to serve people's personal and spiritual needs. Though much of the theory associated with 'postmodernism' (see post-structuralism) did not make any interventions into the natural sciences, the scientific realists took aim at its general influence. The scientific realists argued that large swaths of scholarship, amounting to a rejection of objectivity and realism, had been influenced by major 20th-century post-structuralist philosophers (such as Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard and others), whose work they declare to be incomprehensible or meaningless. They implicate a broad range of fields in this trend, including cultural studies, feminist studies, comparative literature, media studies, and especially science and technology studies, which does apply such methods to the study of science. Historical background Until the mid-20th century, the philosophy of science had concentrated on the viability of scientific method and knowledge, proposing justifications for the truth of scientific theories and observations and attempting to discover at a philosophical level why science worked. Karl Popper, an early opponent of logical positivism in the 20th century, repudiated the classical observationalist/inductivist form of scientific method in favour of empirical falsification. He is also known for his opposition to the classical justificationist/verificationist account of knowledge which he replaced with critical rationalism, \\"the first non justificational philosophy of criticism in the history of philosophy\\".Bartley, William W. (1964). \\"Rationality versus the Theory of Rationality\\". In Mario Bunge: The Critical Approach to Science and Philosophy. The Free Press of Glencoe, section IX. His criticisms of scientific method were adopted by several postmodernist critiques.Stove, David Charles (1982). Popper and After: Four Modern Irrationalists , Oxford: Pergamon Press. A number of 20th-century philosophers maintained that logical models of pure science do not apply to actual scientific practice. It was the publication of Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962, however, which fully opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part socially determined and that it did not operate under the simple logical laws put forward by the logical positivist school of philosophy. Kuhn described the development of scientific knowledge not as a linear increase in truth and understanding, but as a series of periodic revolutions which overturned the old scientific order and replaced it with new orders (what he called \\"paradigms\\"). Kuhn attributed much of this process to the interactions and strategies of the human participants in science rather than its own innate logical structure. (See sociology of scientific knowledge). Some interpreted Kuhn's ideas to mean that scientific theories were, either wholly or in part, social constructs, which many interpreted as diminishing the claim of science to representing objective reality (though many social constructivists do not put forward this claim), and that reality had a lesser or potentially irrelevant role in the formation of scientific theories. In 1971, Jerome Ravetz published Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems, a book describing the role that the scientific community, as a social construct, plays in accepting or rejecting objective scientific knowledge. = Postmodernism = A number of different philosophical and historical schools, often grouped together as \\"postmodernism\\", began reinterpreting scientific achievements of the past through the lens of the practitioners, often positing the influence of politics and economics in the development of scientific theories in addition to scientific observations. Rather than being presented as working entirely from positivistic observations, many scientists of the past were scrutinized for their connection to issues of gender, sexual orientation, race, and class. Some more radical philosophers, such as Paul Feyerabend, argued that scientific theories were themselves incoherent and that other forms of knowledge production (such as those used in religion) served the material and spiritual needs of their practitioners with equal validity as did scientific explanations. Imre Lakatos advanced a midway view between the \\"postmodernist\\" and \\"realist\\" camps. For Lakatos, scientific knowledge is progressive; however, it progresses not by a strict linear path where every new element builds upon and incorporates every other, but by an approach where a \\"core\\" of a \\"research program\\" is established by auxiliary theories which can themselves be falsified or replaced without compromising the core. Social conditions and attitudes affect how strongly one attempts to resist falsification for the core of a program, but the program has an objective status based on its relative explanatory power. Resisting falsification only becomes ad-hoc and damaging to knowledge when an alternate program with greater explanatory power is rejected in favor of another with less. But because it is changing a theoretical core, which has broad ramifications for other areas of study, accepting a new program is also revolutionary as well as progressive. Thus, for Lakatos the character of science is that of being both revolutionary and progressive; both socially informed and objectively justified. The science wars In Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science (1994), the scientists Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt accused postmodernists of anti- intellectualism, presented the shortcomings of relativism, and suggested that postmodernists knew little about the scientific theories they criticized and practiced poor scholarship for political reasons. The authors insist that the \\"science critics\\" misunderstood the theoretical approaches they criticized, given their \\"caricature, misreading, and condescension, [rather] than argument\\".Flower, Michael J. (1995). \\"Review of Higher Superstition \\", Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 113‚Äì14.Isis (Vol. 87, No. 2, 1996), American Anthropologist (Vol. 98, No. 2, 1996).Social Studies of Science (Vol. 26, No. 1, 1996).The review in The Journal of Higher Education (Vol. 66, No. 5, 1995) snidely suggested that book's final sentence proved that politics, the epistemology, philosophy, and science are inter-related. The book sparked the so-called science wars. Higher Superstition inspired a New York Academy of Sciences conference titled The Flight from Science and Reason, organized by Gross, Levitt, and Gerald Holton.Gross, Levitt, and Martin W. Lewis. (1997). The Flight from Science and Reason (New York: New York Academy of Science.) Attendees of the conference were critical of the polemical approach of Gross and Levitt, yet agreed upon the intellectual inconsistency of how laymen, non-scientist, and social studies intellectuals dealt with science.Kramer, Jennifer. \\"Who's Flying ‚Äì And In What Direction?\\" Coverage of the NYAS Flight from Science and Reason conference. Accessed 15 may 2006. =Science wars in Social Text= In 1996, Social Text, a Duke University publication of postmodern critical theory, compiled a \\"Science Wars\\" issue containing brief articles by postmodernist academics in the social sciences and the humanities, that emphasized the roles of society and politics in science. In the introduction to the issue, the Social Text editor, Andrew Ross, said that the attack upon science studies was a conservative reaction to reduced funding for scientific research, characterizing the Flight from Science and Reason conference as an attempted \\"linking together a host of dangerous threats: scientific creationism, New Age alternatives and cults, astrology, UFO-ism, the radical science movement, postmodernism, and critical science studies, alongside the ready-made historical specters of Aryan-Nazi science and the Soviet error of Lysenkoism\\" that \\"degenerated into name- calling\\".Ross, Andrew. (1996). \\"Introduction\\" Social Text 46/47, Vol. 14, Nos. 1 & 2, pp. 1‚Äì13, esp. p. 7. The historian Dorothy Nelkin characterised Gross and Levitt's vigorous response as a \\"call to arms in response to the failed marriage of Science and the State\\"--in contrast to the scientists' historical tendency to avoid participating in perceived political threats, such as creation science, the animal rights movement, and anti-abortionists' attempts to curb fetal research. At the end of the Soviet‚ÄìAmerican Cold War (1945‚Äì91), military funding of science declined, while funding agencies demanded accountability, and research became directed by private interests. Nelkin suggested that postmodernist critics were \\"convenient scapegoats\\" who diverted attention from problems in science.Nelkin, Dorothy. (1996). \\"The Science Wars: Responses to a Marriage Failed\\" Social Text 46/47, Vol. 14, Nos. 1 & 2, pp. 93‚Äì100., p. 95. Also in 1996, physicist Alan Sokal had submitted an article to Social Text titled \\"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\\", which proposed that quantum gravity is a linguistic and social construct and that quantum physics supports postmodernist criticisms of scientific objectivity. After holding the article back from earlier issues due to Sokal's refusal to consider revisions, the staff published it in the \\"Science Wars\\" issue as a relevant contribution.Robbins, Bruce and Ross, Andrew. Editorial Response to the hoax, explaining Social Text's decision to publish Later, in the May 1996 issue of Lingua Franca, in the article \\"A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies\\", Sokal exposed his parody-article, \\"Transgressing the Boundaries\\" as an experiment testing the intellectual rigor of an academic journal that would \\"publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions\\".Sokal, Alan. (1996). \\"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity \\" Social Text 46/47, Vol. 14, Nos. 1 & 2, pp 217‚Äì252. The matter became known as the \\"Sokal Affair\\" and brought greater public attention to the wider conflict.Sokal, Alan. (1996). \\"A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies ,\\" Lingua Franca, May/June, pp 62‚Äì64. Jacques Derrida, a frequent target of \\"anti-relativist\\" criticism in the wake of Sokal's article, responded to the hoax in \\"Sokal and Bricmont Aren't Serious\\", first published in Le Monde. He called Sokal's action sad (triste) for having overshadowed Sokal's mathematical work and ruined the chance to sort out controversies of scientific objectivity in a careful way. Derrida went on to fault him and co- author Jean Bricmont for what he considered an act of intellectual bad faith: they had accused him of scientific incompetence in the English edition of a follow-up book (an accusation several English reviewers noted), but deleted the accusation from the French edition and denied that it had ever existed. He concluded, as the title indicates, that Sokal was not serious in his approach, but had used the spectacle of a \\"quick practical joke\\" to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved. =Continued conflict= In the first few years after the 'Science Wars' edition of Social Text, the seriousness and volume of discussion increased significantly, much of it focused on reconciling the 'warring' camps of postmodernists and scientists. One significant event was the 'Science and Its Critics' conference in early 1997; it brought together scientists and scholars who study science, and featured Alan Sokal and Steve Fuller as keynote speakers. The conference generated the final wave of substantial press coverage (in both news media and scientific journals), though by no means resolved the fundamental issues of social construction and objectivity in science.Baringer, Philip S. (2001). \\"Introduction: 'the science wars'\\", from After the Science Wars, eds. Keith M. Ashman and Philip S. Baringer. New York: Routledge, p. 2. Other attempts have been made to reconcile the two camps. Mike Nauenberg, a physicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, organized a small conference in May 1997 that was attended by scientists and sociologists of science alike, among them Alan Sokal, N. David Mermin and Harry Collins. In the same year, Collins organized the Southampton Peace Workshop, which again brought together a broad range of scientists and sociologists. The Peace Workshop gave rise to the idea of a book that intended to map out some of the arguments between the disputing parties. The One Culture?: A Conversation about Science, edited by chemist Jay A. Labinger and sociologist Harry Collins, was eventually published in 2001. The book, the title of which is a reference to C.P. Snow's The Two Cultures, contains contributions from authors such as Alan Sokal, Jean Bricmont, Steven Weinberg and Steven Shapin.Labinger, Jay A. and Harry Collins. (2001). \\"Preface\\", in: The One Culture?: A Conversation about Science, eds. Labinger, Jay A and Harry Collins. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. ix‚Äìxi. Other important publications related to the science wars include Fashionable Nonsense by Sokal and Jean Bricmont (1998), The Social Construction of What? by Ian Hacking (1999) and Who Rules in Science by James Robert Brown. To John C. Baez, the Bogdanov Affair in 2002 served as the bookend to the Sokal controversy: the review, acceptance, and publication of papers, later alleged to be nonsense, in peer-reviewed physics journals. Cornell physics professor Paul Ginsparg, argued that the cases are not at all similar, and that the fact that some journals and scientific institutions have low standards is \\"hardly a revelation\\".Ginsparg, Paul. (2002, November 12). \\"'Is It Art?' Is Not a Question for Physics\\". New York Times, section A, p. 26. The new editor in chief of the journal Annals of Physics, who was appointed after the controversy along with a new editorial staff, had said that the standards of the journal had been poor leading up to the publication since the previous editor had become sick and died. Interest in the science wars has waned considerably in recent years. Though the events of the science wars are still occasionally mentioned in mainstream press, they have had little effect on either the scientific community or the community of critical theorists. Both sides continue to maintain that the other does not understand their theories, or mistakes constructive criticisms and scholarly investigations for attacks. As Bruno Latour recently put it, \\"Scientists always stomp around meetings talking about 'bridging the two-culture gap', but when scores of people from outside the sciences begin to build just that bridge, they recoil in horror and want to impose the strangest of all gags on free speech since Socrates: only scientists should speak about science!\\"Latour, B. (1999). Pandora's Hope. Essays on the Reality of Science Studies , Harvard University Press, USA. Subsequently, Latour has suggested a re-evaluation of sociology's epistemology based on lessons learnt from the Science Wars: \\"... scientists made us realize that there was not the slightest chance that the type of social forces we use as a cause could have objective facts as their effects\\".Latour, B. (2005). Reassembling the Social. An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory, Oxford University Press, USA, p. 100. However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their critiques have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests . Writing about these developments in the context of global warming, Latour noted that \\"dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives. Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we said?\\"Latour, B. (2004). Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern , Critical Inquiry 30, pp. 225‚Äì48. Kendrick Frazier notes that Latour is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that Latour has said that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.

He is best remembered for his tenure as Secretary of State for Air in the 1930s and for his 'understanding' of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. In 1935 he was removed from the Air Ministry but retained in the Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords. His main record at the Air Ministry included: Background and education His mother, Theresa ('Nellie'), Marchioness of Londonderry, John Singer Sargent, 1912 The eldest son of The 6th Marquess of Londonderry and Lady Theresa Susey Helen, daughter of The 19th Earl of Shrewsbury, he was educated at Eton College and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. His father's family were of partial East Donegal Ulster-Scots descent. Early career On 22 May 1895, Lord Castlereagh was appointed a second lieutenant in the 2nd (Seaham) Durham Artillery Volunteer Corps, a corps within the Volunteer Force attached to the Royal Garrison Artillery (Western Division) and at the time commanded by his father who owned Seaham Colliery from which many of the part-time gunners were recruited.Ian F.W. Beckett, Riflemen Form: A Study of the Rifle Volunteer Movement 1859‚Äì1908, Aldershot: Ogilby Trusts, 1982, , p. 62. After passing out from Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards as a second lieutenant on 8 September 1897. He was promoted lieutenant on 30 August 1899, and appointed adjutant on 9 May 1900. In early 1901 he was appointed by King Edward VII to take part in a special diplomatic mission to announce the King's accession to the governments of Austria-Hungary, Romania, Serbia, and Turkey. In August 1903, following the King's visit to Ireland, he was appointed a Member Fourth Class (present-day Lieutenant) of the Royal Victorian Order, his father being honoured with the Knight Grand Cross of the Order at the same time. He resigned his position of adjutant in the Royal Horse Guards on 24 March 1904, and was promoted to captain on 6 April. Castlereagh was subsequently pressed by his parents to stand for election to the House of Commons at the 1906 general election for Maidstone. He retained his army commission, but was placed on the half-pay list from January 1910. His relatively unsuccessful career on the depleted Unionist backbenches was broken by a return to the British Army during the First World War. First World War As Captain Castlereagh MP he travelled to northern France in the first weeks of the war and reached Paris on 29 August 1914, having been gazetted ADC to General William Pulteney the previous day. Although a staff officer, Castlereagh immediately saw plenty of fighting and believed he had shot and killed one of the enemy on 2 September 1914.Montgomery Hyde, p 116 In the following months of 1914, Castlereagh extensively witnessed the destruction of war and the terrible suffering of the British wounded. He was promoted to the temporary rank of major in his old regiment on 1 November, and to the substantive rank on the 7th. Hitherto reluctant to involve himself, like his father, in Irish politics, the war prompted him to take up the cause of recruitment in Ireland. With his father's death in 1915, he ceased to be MP for Maidstone and inherited the Londonderry title and the immense wealth and status that went with it. His exalted position helped his political career, not least in Ireland, which later brought him favourable attention by the British government. In 1915, Lord Londonderry, as he had now become) ll, was mentioned in despatches and rejoined his regiment, the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues). He saw in 1915 for the first time the horrific effects of gas attack upon human beings when visiting soldiers gassed at the first Battle of Ypres.Montgomery Hyde, p. 122 In 1916 Londonderry was appointed second-in- command of The Blues, part of the 8th Cavalry Brigade. He served at the front during the Battle of the Somme, witnessing the mass slaughter first hand; his closest friend, Lieutenant Colonel Harold Brassey, best man at his wedding in 1899, was killed. He was an acting lieutenant-colonel from 15 December 1916 to 20 January 1917. Londonderry with his cousin Winston Churchill in 1920, as Under-Secretary of State for Air In 1917, Londonderry took command of a composite battalion drawn from the 8th Cavalry Brigade with the brevet rank of Lt-Colonel, and the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues) took part in the massed mounted cavalry attacks on Monchy-le-Preux on the morning of 11 April 1917, during the Battle of Arras. Monchy-le-Preux was one of the keys to the northern end of the Hindenburg Line. L While reconnoitring the enemy near Monchy that the GOC 8th Cavalry Brigade, Brigadier-General Charles Bulkeley- Johnson, was shot in the face; he fell with a piercing shriek, the thirtieth British General to be killed in action or to die of wounds on the Western Front.Davies & Maddocks, \\"Bloody Red Tabs: General Officer Casualties of the Great War, 1914‚Äì18\\" This put Brevet Lt-Colonel Londonderry temporarily in command of the 8th Cavalry Brigade during their charge in the Battle of Arras. At Monchy 600 cavalrymen were casualties and many more horses died. The animals were tethered in the open, as their riders took cover; attempts to take them to the rear during a \\"box barrage\\" only increased the casualties.\\"April 1917 ‚Äì The Real War Horse\\" Commonwealth War Graves Commission Newsletter, April 2012; \\"War Horse at Monchy-le-Preux ‚Äì 11 April 1917\\" article by Stephen Barker For Londonderry, the experiences of war and the carnage of his brother officers and the family and school friends he grew up with would, as Professor Kershaw commented, \\"leave an indelible mark on him\\". After serving in the Irish Convention of 1917‚Äì18, Lord Londonderry served on the short-lived Viceroy's Advisory Council, meeting at Dublin Castle in the autumn of 1918. Promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 7 November 1918, he retired from the army on 10 September 1919 as a major and brevet lieutenant-colonel. On 13 August 1920, he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 55th Medium Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery in the Territorial Army, the successor unit to his father's 2nd (Seaham) Durham Artillery Volunteers. He continued in that role until World War II, after it had been converted into the 63rd (Northumbrian) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery in Anti- Aircraft Command.Army List, various dates. Interwar period The Marquess, c.1921 Shield of arms of Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry, KG, GCVO, CB, PC, JP, DL He was appointed to the new Air Council at Westminster in 1919 by the postwar coalition government. Promoted to Under- Secretary of State for Air in 1920, Londonderry was nevertheless frustrated and took advantage of his Ulster connections to join the first Cabinet of the Government of Northern Ireland in June 1921, as Leader of the Senate and Minister for Education. Londonderry was particularly interested in education and favoured a secularised interest, not the least as a way to end Catholic education.Moore, Cormac Birth of the Border: The Impact of Partition in Ireland Newbridge: Merrion Press, 2019 p.169 Londonderry appointed the Lynn Commission, headed by Robert Lynn, for advice about education. Lynn stated during the commission's hearings his belief that it would be a waste of public funds to teach Gaelic in the schools, a proposal that was widely seen as promoting Unionism, and led to a Catholic boycott of the commission.Moore, Cormac Birth of the Border: The Impact of Partition in Ireland Newbridge: Merrion Press, 2019 p.172 At Belfast, he acted as a check on the increasingly sectarian, partisan and survivalist government of Prime Minister Sir James Craig. Nevertheless, Londonderry's Education Act of 1923 received little in the way of goodwill from either Protestant or Catholic educational interests and was amended to the point that its purpose, to secularise schooling in Northern Ireland, was lost. In 1926, he resigned from the Government of Northern Ireland and, in 1929, he left the Parliament of Northern Ireland entirely. He was to involve himself in the General Strike of 1926, playing the role of a moderate mine owner, a stance made easier for him by the relative success of the Londonderry mines in County Durham. His performance earned him high praise, and along with the Londonderrys' role as leading political hosts, he was rewarded by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin with a seat in the Cabinet in 1928 as First Commissioner of Works. Londonderry was invited to join the emergency National Government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and Lord President Baldwin in 1931. That was the cause of some scandal as MacDonald's many critics accused the erstwhile Labour leader of being too friendly with Edith, Lady Londonderry. When the National Government won the 1931 General Election he returned to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Air (Londonderry held a pilot's licence). This position became increasingly important during his tenure, not least due to the deliberations of the League of Nations Disarmament Conference at Geneva. In September 1931, Japan seized the Manchuria region of China, setting up the sham state of Manchukuo while making claims to the effect that the rest of China was in the exclusive Japanese sphere of influence, an interpretation that the Chinese government vehemently objected to. In January 1932, the First Battle of Shanghai began that saw the Japanese bomb much of Shanghai into rubble.Kershaw, Ian Making Friends with Hitler: Lord Londonderry, the Nazis, and the Road to War, London: Penguin, 2004 p.70 The scenes of Shanghai in flames together with the increasingly assertive Japanese claims about China and the Far East in general as within its sphere of influence convinced Londonderry that Britain needed a strong Royal Air Force as the best way to deter Japan from attacking the British empire and to ensure that Britain was prepared for war should Anglo-Japanese relations take a turn for the worse.Kershaw, Ian Making Friends with Hitler: Lord Londonderry, the Nazis, and the Road to War, London: Penguin, 2004 p.70 Londonderry toed the British government's equivocal line on disarmament but opposed in Cabinet any moves that would risk the deterrent value of the Royal Air Force. He was thus attacked by Clement Attlee and the Labour Party and became a liability to the National Government. In the spring of 1935, he was removed from the Air Ministry but retained in the Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords. Combined with his role as a leading member of the Anglo-German Fellowship, he attracted the popular nickname of \\"Londonderry Herr\\".Martin Pugh, \\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\\" Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the War, Pimlico, 2006, p. 270 The sense of hurt Lord Londonderry felt at that and accusations that he had misled Baldwin about the strength of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe led him to seek to clear his reputation as a 'warmonger' by engaging in amateur diplomacy. The British historian Richard Griffiths made a distinction between appeasers, a term that he reserved for government officials who believed in appeasement of the Axis states for a variety of reasons, many quite pragmatic, and the enthusiasts for Nazi Germany, which he described a group of individuals who acting on their own as private citizens sought better relations with the Third Reich, usually for ideological reasons.Griffins, Richard T., Fellow Travellers of the Right: British enthusiasts for Nazi Germany, 1933-9, Constable, 1980, p. 1 Griffins defined Londonderry as an enthusiast for Nazi Germany, instead of an appeaser, by noting that after June 1935, Londonderry was speaking mostly for himself when he sought out the company of Nazi leaders.Griffins, Richard T., Fellow Travellers of the Right: British enthusiasts for Nazi Germany, 1933-9, Constable, 1980, p. 140 Londonderry joined the Anglo-German Fellowship, a society that sought to bring together elites from Britain and Germany with the aim of forging an Anglo-German alliance.Griffins, Richard T., Fellow Travellers of the Right: British enthusiasts for Nazi Germany, 1933-9, Constable, 1980, p. 185 As part of his work as an amateur diplomat, that involved Londonderry making visits to meet Hitler, Hess, Goering, Himmler, von Papen and other senior members of the German government Between January 1936 and September 1938, Londonderry made six visits to Nazi Germany, the first lasting for three weeks, but a seventh invitation that had been accepted for March 1939 was abruptly declined by Londonderry after the Nazi occupation of Prague. From early 1936 onward, Londonderry's public statements about the Third Reich became markedly admiring and sympathetic.Griffins, Richard T., Fellow Travellers of the Right: British enthusiasts for Nazi Germany, 1933-9, Constable, 1980, p. 141 In March 1936, Leopold von Hoesch, the German ambassador in London in a report to Berlin called Londonderry \\"one of those on whom the German government relied for the right opinions\\".Griffins, Richard T., Fellow Travellers of the Right: British enthusiasts for Nazi Germany, 1933-9, Constable, 1980, p. 141 As part of his amateur diplomacy, Londonderry invited in 1936 Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, later the German foreign minister, to two visits at the principal ancestral homes of the Marquess in Northern Ireland and England. They came to Mount Stewart on 29 May to 2 June and were at Wynyard Hall on 13‚Äì17 November and for subsequent briefings with government officials in London. During the first two visits, prior to the abdication of Edward VIII, whom the Nazis assessed as a supporter, Londonderry was considered an aristocrat of real influence by Hitler. The friendly regard in which Londonderry was held in Berlin was reflected in Hitler indiscreetly informing his guest, in October 1936, of his intended moves both on Czechoslovakia and Poland, years before two invasions happened.Fleming, p.189 Although Londonderry immediately passed that information regarding Hitler's indicated future direction of German policy on to a member of the British government by a letter to Lord Halifax on 24 December 1936,later reproduced in \\"Ourselves and Germany\\"- see below ‚Äì as letter \\"to a friend\\", p. 130‚Äì4. rearmament was not notably accelerated in Britain. In the end, Londonderry's high-profile promotion of Anglo-German friendship marked him with a far greater slur than what had led him to engage in appeasement in the first place. Fall from grace Under attack from anti- Nazis inside and outside Westminster, Lord Londonderry attempted to explain his position by publishing Ourselves and Germany in March 1938. Then, after the Munich agreement, in October 1938, Londonderry wrote in a letter that he was aware that Hitler was \\"gradually getting back to the theories which he evolved in prison\\", when working on Mein Kampf. Londonderry's work was openly antisemitic, declaring: ‚ÄúI have no great affection for the Jews...it is possible to trace their participation in most of the international disturbances which have created so much havoc in different countries.‚ÄùPrivilege, John. ‚ÄúThe Northern Ireland Government, the New Industries Act, and Refugees from the Third Reich, 1934‚àí1940‚Äù Holocaust and Genocide Studies. 31.1 (2017): 89 Honorary Air Commodore Lord Londonderry (centre) looks on as Air Chief Marshal Sir Cyril Newall, Chief of the Air Staff, inspects an aircraft in France. After playing a marginal role in the resignation of Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister in 1940, he failed to win any favour from the new Prime Minister, Winston Churchill (his second cousin), who thought little of his talents. Out of office during the war, he produced his memoirs, Wings of Destiny (1943), a relatively short book that was considerably censured by some of his former colleagues. Lord Londonderry served as Lord Lieutenant of County Down between 1915 and 1949 and of County Durham between 1928 and 1949 and was Chancellor of the University of Durham and The Queen's University of Belfast. He was Mayor of Durham during the year of George VI's Coronation (1937). He was sworn of the Irish Privy Council in 1918 and of the Imperial Privy Council in 1925 and appointed a Knight of the Garter in 1919. Family On 28 November 1899, Lord Londonderry married the Hon.

Lord Londonderry had an illegitimate daughter with actress Fannie Ward, named Doroth√© Mabel Lewis [b.1900]. She first married, in 1918, a nephew of mining magnate Barney Barnato, Capt. Jack Barnato, who died of pneumonia shortly after their wedding. Her second husband, whom she married in 1922, was Terence Plunket, 6th Baron Plunket, and with him she had three sons: Patrick Plunket, 7th Baron Plunket, Robin Plunket, 8th Baron Plunket, and the Hon Shaun Plunket. Lord and Lady Plunket were killed in an aircraft crash in California in 1938. Having suffered a stroke after a gliding accident a few years after the end of the war, Lord Londonderry died on 10 February 1949 at Mount Stewart, County Down, aged 70.

He is a professor in, and a former director of, the Science Studies Unit at the University of Edinburgh. He is a key figure in the Edinburgh school and played a major role in the development of the field of science and technology studies. He is best known for advocating the strong programme in the sociology of scientific knowledge, most notably in his book Knowledge and Social Imagery. Biography He was born in Derby. He started his academic career in philosophy and psychology. In 1972 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Edinburgh for his thesis \\"Speech and the regulation of behaviour.\\" In the 1970s he and Barry Barnes were the major figures of the strong programme, which put forward queries against philosophical a priorism in the understanding of scientific knowledge. This is an approach, popular in the philosophy of science, that simply precluded inquiries about science by treating successful scientific knowledge as simply true or rational without empirically investigating how such knowledge has come to be accepted as true or rational. Bloor's book Knowledge and Social Imagery (Routledge, 1976) is one of the key texts of the strong programme. Bloor wrote extensively on the Kuhn/Popper debate, and is a representative figure of the sociology of scientific knowledge. In the 1980s when French scholars like Bruno Latour developed the actor-network theory (partially based on the strong programme), David Bloor strongly disagreed with the ANT camp when they argued that human and non-humans should be treated in an equivalent manner, going so far as to write an article entitled \\"Anti- Latour\\".

The film is based on these historical figures but fictionalizes their story in dramatized form. It was nominated for three Academy Awards, and won a Golden Globe award for Best Film Promoting International Understanding. Film historians have said that the movie was one of the first major Westerns since the Second World War to portray the Indians sympathetically.John H. Lenihan, Showdown: Confronting Modern America in the Western Film, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1980, pp. 55‚Äì89. Plot Tom Jeffords comes across a wounded, 14-year-old Apache boy dying from buckshot wounds in his back. Jeffords gives the boy water and treats his wounds. The boy's tribesmen appear and are at first hostile but decide to let Jeffords go free. However, when a group of gold prospectors approaches, the Apache gag Jeffords and tie him to a tree. Helpless, he watches as they attack the prospectors and torture the survivors. The warriors then let him go but warn him not to enter Apache territory again. When Jeffords returns to Tucson, he encounters a prospector who escaped the ambush. He corrects a man's exaggerated account of the attack, but Ben Slade is incredulous and does not see why Jeffords did not kill the Apache boy. Instead, Jeffords learns the Apache language and customs and plans to go to Cochise's stronghold on behalf of his friend, Milt, who is in charge of the mail service in Tucson. Jeffords enters the Apache stronghold and begins a parley with Cochise, who agrees to let the couriers through. Jeffords meets a young Apache girl, Sonseeahray, and falls in love. A few of Cochise's warriors attack an army wagon train and kill the survivors. The townsfolk nearly lynch Jeffords as a traitor before he is saved by General Oliver Otis Howard who recruits Jeffords to negotiate peace with Cochise. Howard, the \\"Christian General\\" condemns racism, saying that the Bible \\"says nothing about pigmentation of the skin.‚Äù Jeffords makes a peace treaty with Cochise, but a group led by Geronimo, oppose the treaty and leave the stronghold. When these renegades ambush a stagecoach, Jeffords rides off to seek help from Cochise and the stagecoach is saved. Jeffords and Sonseeahray marry in an Apache ceremony and have several days of tranquility. Later, Ben Slade's son spins a story to Jeffords and Cochise about two of his horses stolen by Cochise's people. Cochise says that his people did not take them and doubts his story, as he knows the boy's father is an Apache hater. They then decide to go along with the boy up the canyon but are ambushed by the boy's father and a gang of men from Tucson. Jeffords is badly wounded and Sonseeahray is killed but Cochise kills most of the men, including Ben Slade. Cochise forbids Jeffords to retaliate, saying that the ambush was not done by the military and that Geronimo broke the peace no less than Slade and his men, and that peace must be maintained. Jeffords rides off with the belief that \\"the death of Sonseeahray had put a seal upon the peace, and from that day on wherever I went, in the cities, among the Apaches and in the mountains, I always remembered, my wife was with me.‚Äù Cast * James Stewart as Tom Jeffords * Jeff Chandler as Cochise * Debra Paget as Sonseeahray ('Morningstar') * Basil Ruysdael as Gen.

Before we found Chandler we were even considering Ezio Pinza.\\" Jeff Chandler was cast in May 1949 on the basis of his performance in Sword in the Desert. He was working in several radio series at the time, Michael Shayne and Our Miss Brooks, and had to be written out of them for several weeks. Filming started on 6 June 1949. It was primarily shot on location in northern Arizona, approximately 30 miles south of Flagstaff. Apaches from the Whiteriver agency on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation played themselves.Frank Daugherty, \\"Story of Apache Treaty Being Filmed in Arizona\\", The Christian Science Monitor 29 July 1949: 5. Debra Paget was only 15 years old when she played the love interest to 41-year-old James Stewart. Canadian Mohawk actor Jay Silverheels portrayed Geronimo. The movie was based on the 558-page novel Blood Brother (1947) by Elliott Arnold, which told the story of the peace agreement between the Apache leader Cochise and the U.S. Army, 1855‚Äì1874. The studio employed nearly 240 Indians from Arizona's Fort Apache Indian Reservation; many location scenes were shot in Sedona, Arizona. (The story of Cochise actually occurred in what is now the Dragoon Mountains in the Douglas Ranger District of the Coronado National Forest in southeastern Arizona.) The studio attempted to portray Apache customs in the film, like the Social Dance and the Girl's Sunrise Ceremony (the girl's puberty rite). For the character of Cochise, director Daves eliminated the traditional style of broken English and replaced it with conventional English so that whites and Indians would sound alike. Portrayal of Indians Although many Westerns of the pre-World War II period portrayed American Indians as hostile to the white settlers, others did show Indians in a positive light. Broken Arrow, however, is noteworthy for being one of the first post-war Westerns to portray Native Americans in a balanced, sympathetic way ‚Äì although most of the Indians were played by white actors, with Brooklyn-born Jeff Chandler portraying Apache leader Cochise. An exception was that Native Canadian Mohawk actor Jay Silverheels was noted for his role as Geronimo in the film. Some scholars have said that the film appealed to an ideal of tolerance and racial equality that would influence later Westerns and indicate Hollywood's response to the Indian's evolving role in American society.Angela Aleiss, \\"Hollywood Addresses Postwar Assimilation: Indian/White Attitudes in Broken Arrow\\", American Indian Culture and Research Journal, 11(1), pp. 67‚Äì79. Chronicle of the Cinema praised the film: \\"Based on verifiable fact, it faithfully evokes the historical relationship between Cochise and Jeffords, marking a historical rehabilitation of Indians in the cinema.\\"Robyn Karney (editor), Chronicle of the Cinema; London: Dorling Kindersley, 1995; p. 400. In 1950, Rosebud Yellow Robe, a Native American folklorist, educator, and author, was hired by Twentieth-Century Fox to undertake a national tour to promote the film. Rosebud explained that there were no such things as Indian princesses, and that the myth started when Pocahontas went to England and the English named her \\"Lady Rebecca.‚Äù Rosebud voiced complaints about the portrayals of Indians on radio, screen, and television to \\"a new generation of children learning the old stereotypes about whooping, warring Indians, as if there weren't anything else interesting about us.\\"Weinberg, p 51.

Barry Barnes, Harry Collins, Donald A. MacKenzie,Donald MacKenzie, \\"Notes on the science and social relations debate.\\" Capital & Class 5.2 (1981): 47-60. and John Henry. The strong programme's influence on Science and Technology Studies is credited as being unparalleled (Latour 1999). The largely Edinburgh-based school of thought has illustrated how the existence of a scientific community, bound together by allegiance to a shared paradigm, is a prerequisite for normal scientific activity. The strong programme is a reaction against \\"weak\\" sociologies of science, which restricted the application of sociology to \\"failed\\" or \\"false\\" theories, such as phrenology. Failed theories would be explained by citing the researchers' biases, such as covert political or economic interests. Sociology would be only marginally relevant to successful theories, which succeeded because they had revealed a fact of nature. The strong programme proposed that both \\"true\\" and \\"false\\" scientific theories should be treated the same way. Both are caused by social factors or conditions, such as cultural context and self-interest. All human knowledge, as something that exists in the human cognition, must contain some social components in its formation process. Characteristics As formulated by David Bloor,David Bloor, Knowledge and Social Imagery (1976) the strong programme has four indispensable components: #Causality: it examines the conditions (psychological, social, and cultural) that bring about claims to a certain kind of knowledge. #Impartiality: it examines successful as well as unsuccessful knowledge claims. #Symmetry: the same types of explanations are used for successful and unsuccessful knowledge claims alike. #Reflexivity: it must be applicable to sociology itself. History Because the strong programme originated at the 'Science Studies Unit,' University of Edinburgh, it is sometimes termed the Edinburgh School. However, there is also a Bath School associated with Harry Collins that makes similar proposals. In contrast to the Edinburgh School, which emphasizes historical approaches, the Bath School emphasizes microsocial studies of laboratories and experiments.Harry M. Collins, \\"Introduction: Stages in the empirical programme of relativism.\\" Social studies of science (1981): 3-10. in JSTOR The Bath school, however, does depart from the strong programme on some fundamental issues. In the social construction of technology (SCOT) approach developed by Collins' student Trevor Pinch, as well as by the Dutch sociologist Wiebe Bijker, the strong programme was extended to technology. There are SSK-influenced scholars working in science and technology studies programs throughout the world.Wiebe E. Bijker, et al. The social construction of technological systems: New directions in the sociology and history of technology (MIT press, 2012) Criticism In order to study scientific knowledge from a sociological point of view, the strong programme has adhered to a form of radical relativism. In other words, it argues that ‚Äì in the social study of institutionalised beliefs about \\"truth\\" ‚Äì it would be unwise to use \\"truth\\" as an explanatory resource. That would be to include the answer as part of the question (Barnes 1992), not to mention a thoroughly \\"whiggish\\" approach towards the study of history ‚Äì that is an approach seeing human history as an inevitable march towards truth and enlightenment. Alan Sokal has criticised radical relativism as part of the science wars, on the basis that such an understanding will lead inevitably towards solipsism and postmodernism. Markus Seidel attacks the main arguments ‚Äì underdetermination and norm-circularity ‚Äì provided by Strong Programme proponents for their relativism.Markus Seidel Epistemic Relativism. A Constructive Critique, 2014, Palgrave Macmillan Strong programme scholars insist that their approach has been misunderstood by such a criticism and that its adherence to radical relativism is strictly methodological.

It aired weekday mornings until 1998, after which it was replaced with an unhosted block, called \\"YTV Jr.\\". While most hosted blocks had one or two hosts, Treehouse had three PJs (Program Jockeys) and was also co-hosted by The Fuzzpaws, which were stuffed animal puppets. As the name suggests, it was set in a tree house. PJ Katie had her own TV show, called PJ Katie's Farm, where she acted out stories with clay animals.

Havelok the Dane, also known as Havelok or Lay of Havelok the Dane, is a Middle English romance considered to be part of the Matter of England.Boundaries in medieval romance, Neil Cartlidge, DS Brewer, 2008, , 9781843841555. pp. 29-42\\"Both Horn and Havelok the Dane belong to a group of poems known as the Matter of England, late medieval romances based in part on the oral folk culture that survived the Norman Conquest. This Category also usually includes Athelston and Bevis of Hampton.\\" Introduction to King Horn ed. B. Herzman, Graham Drake and Eve Salisbury; originally published in Four Romances of England (Kalamazoo, MI, 1999, p. 1. The story, however, is also known in two earlier Anglo-Norman versions. Most scholars place the writing of Havelok the Dane at the end of the thirteenth century, between 1280 and 1290. The name \\"Havelok\\" also has many variations in spelling, and can be found as \\"Haveloc\\", \\"Havelock\\", or \\"Aybloc\\". Overview The story of Havelok is first attested in lines 37‚Äì818 of Geoffrey Gaimar's Anglo-Norman Estoire des Engleis of about 1135‚Äì40. This was the basis for another Anglo-Norman poem, the Lai d'havelok, which in turn may have influenced Havelok the Dane. Havelok is the second oldest surviving romance written in English, after King Horn; it is believed to have been composed somewhere between 1280‚Äì1310. The romance survives in one imperfect version in the Bodleian Library in Oxford University, as well as some fragments. A copy of the 3,001 line poem is available to view in Grimsby Public Library. A new publication of the late 19th-century translation by Walter Skeat is available as The Lay of Havelock the Dane. Havelok is often categorized as belonging to the so-called Matter of England, because it deals with legends of English history rather than the legends of Rome, France and Britain, the three traditional subjects of medieval romance. The poem is notable for its interest in law and legal practice and its exploration of ideal kingship, as well as for its detailed depiction of working-class life in 13th-century Lincolnshire. It has been called a 'bourgeois' romance because of the high value placed on hard work, virtuous behaviour, and proverbial wisdom, but since this value is just as observable in working-class life the term can be misleading. There is evidence that the legend of Havelok was a popular one, as the town of Grimsby, which features in the story, depicted three of its characters ‚Äì Havelok, Goldeboru, and Grim ‚Äì on its town seal in the early 13th century. The story unites the local interest of the founding of Grimsby in Lincolnshire to an interest in the complex national identity of England in the Middle Ages, bringing together early English, Norman, Danish and British influences. Even today, the town seal of Grimsby still names Grim, Havelok, and Goldborow. It is possible to visit the \\"Grim-stone\\" and the \\"Havelok-stone\\" at Grimsby and Lincoln, respectively. A statue of Grim and Havelok stood outside the main site of Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education from 1973 until 2006, but was removed on health and safety grounds after Havelock was decapitated by vandals.http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/news/Plan-resurrect-Grim-Havelock- statue-mystery-whereabouts-solved/article-574748-detail/article.html The character Havelok may be based upon the historical Amla√≠b Cuar√°n, a 10th- century Norse-Gaelic ruler, and the legend's plot loosely based upon Amla√≠b's life,. though there is no critical consensus. Skeat posited a possible link to early legends of Hamlet. Plot summary of the Middle English romance Havelok is intricately constructed, consisting of a double arc in which the royal heirs of both Denmark and England are unjustly displaced as children but later restored to their rightful positions. The poem opens in England during the reign of Athelwold, who is described in ideal terms as a just and virtuous king. He dies without an adult successor and leaves his young daughter Goldborow to the care of Godrich, Earl of Cornwall, who is to rule as regent until Goldburow can be married. Athelwold stipulates that she should be married to the \\"highest man in England\\". After Athelwold's death Godrich immediately betrays his oath and imprisons Goldborow in a remote tower in Dover. The poem then shifts to Denmark, where a similarly virtuous king, Birkabein, dies, leaving behind two daughters, Swanborow and Helfled, and a son, Havelok. Godard, a wealthy retainer, is appointed regent. Godard too betrays his trust: he brutally murders the daughters by cutting their throats and hands the three-year-old Havelok over to a thrall, the fisherman Grim, to be drowned in the sea. Grim recognizes Havelok as the rightful heir to the kingdom when he sees a pair of miraculous signs: a bright light that emerges from the boy‚Äôs mouth when he is sleeping, and the ‚Äúkynemerk,‚Äù a cross-shaped birthmark on his shoulder. Grim is persuaded to spare Havelok's life, but tells Godard that he has killed the childThe motive of a Royal baby given to a commoner to be killed, but being spared and growing up as a commoner without knowing his true origins, has many parallels - for example the story of Oedipus in Greek mythology.. Grim flees with Havelok and his family to England, where he finds the town of Grimsby at the estuary of the Humber. Havelok is brought up as part of Grim's family and works as a fisherman alongside Grim and his sons. (Several versions tell that Havelok was raised under a false name, Cuaran, in order to protect his identity, though the Middle English version omits this detail.) Havelok grows to an extraordinary size and strength, and has a huge appetite; during a time of famine, Grim is unable to feed him, and Havelok leaves home to seek his subsistence in Lincoln, barefoot and clad in a cloak made from an old sail. In Lincoln he is taken in by Bertram, a cook in a noble household, and works for him as a kitchen-boy. Havelok's humility, gentleness and cheerful nature make him universally popular, especially with children, and his unusual height, strength and beauty draw attention wherever he goes. During a festival, Havelok takes part in a stone-throwing competition and far surpasses the efforts of the other young men with his near-superhuman strength. This victory makes him the subject of discussion and brings him to the notice of Godrich, who is present in Lincoln for a parliament. Godrich notices Havelok‚Äôs unusual height and decides to arrange a marriage between him and Goldburow, as this will fulfil the literal terms of his promise to Athelwold that Goldboruw should marry the 'highest' man in the kingdom; believing Havelok to be a peasant's son, he intends to deprive Goldboruw of her inheritance by the marriage. Havelok is reluctant to marry because he is too poor to support a wife, but he submits to the union after being threatened by Godrich. Havelok and Goldborow marry and return to Grimsby, where they are taken in by Grim‚Äôs children. That night Goldborow is awakened by a bright light and sees the flame coming out of Havelok‚Äôs mouth. She then notices his birthmark, and an angel-voice tells her of Havelok‚Äôs royal lineage and his destiny as king of Denmark and England. At the same time, Havelok has a dream in which he embraces the land and people of Denmark in his arms and presents the kingdom at Goldboruw's feet. When he wakes, they share their visions and agree to return to Denmark. Havelok sails to Denmark with Goldborow and Grim‚Äôs three eldest sons in order to reclaim his kingdom. Disguised as a merchant, Havelok is sheltered by Ubbe, a Danish nobleman. Ubbe is impressed by Havelok's strength in an attack on the house, and at night notices the light coming out of Havelok's mouth; he recognises Havelok as the son of Birkabein and immediately pledges his support to Havelok in overthrowing Godard. When Havelok has received the submission of many of the Danish lords amid great rejoicing, he defeats Godard and the usurper is condemned to be flayed and hanged. Havelok invades England, overthrows Godrich in battle and claims the throne in Goldborow's name. As king of Denmark and England, Havelok rules justly for more than sixty years. He and Goldborow enjoy a happy, loving marriage, and have fifteen children: all their sons become kings and all their daughters queens. Plot summary according to Gaimar This plot summary is based on the translation of Hardy and Martin. King Adelbrit is a Dane ruling Norfolk under Constantine, King Arthur's nephew, along with a part of Denmark (71-74). King Edelsie is a Briton and King of Lincoln and Lindsey. His sister Orwain marries Adelbrit, and their child is Argentille. Orwain and Adelbrit die at much the same time (lines 1-94). When Adelbrit dies, Edelsie marries his niece to a serving lad called Cuheran in order to clear the way for taking over Adelbrit's kingdom himself (93-104, 165-80). Cuheran is handsome, magnanimous and the freemen and nobles of the household would have given him anything he wanted if only he weren't so humble that he asks for nothing (95-154). In something of a blind motif which does, however, serve to suggest Cuheran's boorishness, it takes a few nights for Cuheran to get round to having sex with Argentille (177-94). Argentille has a prophetic dream (195-240). Argentille awakes to find Cuheran sleeping on his back, with a flame burning at his mouth. She wakes Cuheran and he explains the dream as a prophecy of the feast he will be cooking the next day and adds that he doesn't know why a flame burns at his mouth when he sleeps (241-310). Argentille decides she would rather live with Cuheran's family than in shame with her uncle (301-28). Cuheran believes he has two brothers (who are in fact not his brothers, 155-60) and a sister Kelloc, and that they are all the sons of a fisherman and salt-seller called Grim (330-34) and his wife Sebrug (369-70). Kelloc and her husband Alger, a fisherman (331) and a merchant (455-62, 481-84), resolve to tell Cuheran that he is actually called Havelock and is the son of King Gunter of Denmark and Queen Alvive, daughter of King Gaifer. Kelloc and her brothers are in fact the children of Alvive by one of her retainers, Grim. Gunter was killed by King Arthur; Alvive fled with Grim, their children, and Havelock/Cuheran, but was herself killed by pirates on the way (426-40, 582-85). Kelloc's husband trades with Denmark and reckons that the people would be happy if Havelock came to claim his inheritance (334-468). Havelock and Argentille sail to Denmark with the merchants (469-504). Denmark is ruled by the evil King Odulf/Edulf, brother of King Aschis, one of Arthur's knights (510-28). On arrival, Havelock is attacked and Argentille seized. Havelock defeats the attackers and rescues Argentille, but the two are forced to flee to a church tower where they defend themselves (533-54). Fortunately, Sigar Estalre, Gunter's one-time steward, sees Havelock's resemblance to Gunter and rescues him from his predicament (505-9, 555-70). Sigar hears Havelock's story and checks its veracity. First, by looking for the flame when he sleeps (571-645), and then by getting Havelock to sound a horn which only the rightful heir of Denmark can sound, whereupon everyone takes Havelock as their lord (646-734). Havelock defeats Edulf in battle (735-758) and then Edelsie, having used the tactic taught to him by Argentille of propping up the corpses of his army to make it look like he has more men. Edelsie dies a few days later, allowing Havelock and Argentille to inherit both Edelsie's and Adelbrit's old lands. Havelock rules for twenty years (735-818). Norse mythology connotations In Norse mythology, Grim (Mask) and Grimnir (Masked One) are names adopted by the deity Odin (Anglo-Saxon Woden) when travelling incognito amongst mortals, as in the short poem known as 'Grimnir's Sayings' (Grimnismal) in the Poetic Edda.Grimnir's Sayings (verses 46,49), The Poetic Edda The intended audience of the Havelock tale (recorded much later in the form of The Lay of Havelock the Dane) may have understood the fisherman Grim to be Odin in disguise.

He is best known for his appearances with World Wrestling Entertainment between 2002 and 2007, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling under the ring name Basham in 2007. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1993-1996)= Made his debut in 1993 wrestling in Indiana. Also wrestled in independent promotions in Kentucky. In 1994 he wrestled for the United States Wrestling Association located in Tennessee. He stayed there until 1996. =Ohio Valley Wrestling (1996‚Äì2003, 2005, 2007)= Before being called up to WWE's main roster Basham competed in its developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling. Basham is the nephew of OVW founder Danny Davis. Basham was a top fan favorite in the company winning the OVW Heavyweight Championship on a number of occasions. Basham turned villainous and was involved in a unique storyline that saw him compete under a mask as Machine. The story was that Basham and his real-life uncle and trainer Danny Davis had a falling out which led to Basham quitting the wrestling business. However, as his uncle's other OVW-trained superstars like Nick Dinsmore, Rob Conway and Damaja began getting opportunities to wrestle on WWE television and become contracted talents, Basham grew resentful and resurfaced as the masked Machine to spoil the opportunities for the other men Davis had trained. Dinsmore would go on to defeat The Machine in a Retirement versus Mask match at the Last Dance on June 27, 2001, and unmask Machine as Doug Basham. Basham went on to create the Revolution faction and feuded with OVW's top stars. Basham signed a WWE development contract in April 2002 and was soon signed to SmackDown! in May 2003. In OVW Doug took credit for The Basham Brothers gimmick as his way of getting back at Danny a.k.a. Damaja. The two took part in an epic final encounter which saw Revolution members (including Johnny Spade, Mark Magnus, and Rob Conway) handcuffed to Damaja's allies (including Nick Dinsmore and Johnny Jeter) with Matt Morgan on the entrance ramp to prevent any more run-ins. Damaja was victorious leading to Doug being forced out of OVW. After the match, Doug disbanded Revolution causing the members to attack him and Damaja running back into the ring armed with a Louisville Slugger to make the save. Doug then embraced former partner Damaja and his uncle OVW owner Danny Davis, before going to the back shaking hands with the OVW fans thus making him a face. After disappearing from WWE TV in September 2005, Doug would return to OVW under a new gimmick; \\"The Superstar of Superstars.\\" At this time, he came out to the ring using the Superman theme before signing a new deal with WWE in April 2006. On March 7, 2007 The Basham Brothers returned to OVW and defeated Wyatt Young and Mike Tolar in a dark match. =World Wrestling Entertainment (2002‚Äì2007)= With WWE impressed by his in-ring ability, Doug received numerous try-out matches in late 2002 and early 2003 against opponents such as Mark Jindrak, Charlie Haas, Lenny Lane, Val Venis, Nathan Jones, Redd Dogg, Nova, Johnny Jeter, Horshu, Shannon Moore, and Billy Kidman. He also teamed with the likes of Damaja, Sean O'Haire, and Bull Buchanan. The Basham Brothers in 2005 Basham made his official debut on the May 29, 2003 episode of SmackDown as one-half of the tag team, The Basham Brothers with his tag partner Danny Basham. The Basham Brothers debuted as a team on May 29 and defeated the team of Rikishi and Brian Kendrick. The Basham Brothers were later joined by Shaniqua. They were given a bondage-based S&M; gimmick and won their first WWE Tag Team Championship from Los Guerreros on the October 23 edition of SmackDown. The team would go on to lose the titles on the February 5, 2004 episode of SmackDown! to Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty. On February 15 at No Way Out, The Basham Brothers and Shaniqua faced Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi in a handicap match and lost when Shaniqua was pinned by Rikishi. The Basham Brothers would go on to lose their manager Shaniqua when she was sent to OVW for training not long after No Way Out. For the next few months The Basham Brothers were regulars on Velocity and appeared on a few occasions on SmackDown generally losing. The Bashams were given a one-off television appearance on SmackDown as part of the Tough Enough IV qualifiers. The remaining contestants received 30 seconds each to retrieve a flag from the far corner of the ring. Anyone who succeeded within the time limit would be immune from elimination until the next round. However, the Bashams were the obstacles that were put in place to prevent the challengers from reaching the flag. The Bashams managed to resist all seven finalists consecutively. They also teased hot favorite Daniel Puder by letting him get within 1 inch of the flag in his final seconds of his turn. (Puder had become the hot favorite one week earlier when he almost defeated a fresh Kurt Angle in a real wrestling match in seconds immediately after 3 hours of circuit training specifically designed to wear the contestants out). Impressed by their performance, the tag team were given a push. The Basham Brothers would go on to join John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield's Cabinet faction on November 25 and became known as JBL's Co-Secretaries of Defense. Their role was often to sacrifice themselves to prevent Layfield from getting harmed after he had provoked an opponent. The Bashams would once again win Tag Team gold defeating the teams of Rey Mysterio and Rob Van Dam, Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak, and Eddie Guerrero and Booker T in a four-way elimination match in January 2005. The Basham Brothers lost the titles to Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero at No Way Out on February 20. The Bashams would then win sporadically on SmackDown! or defeat any teams that they faced on Velocity. The Basham Brothers quit Layfield's Cabinet on the June 16, 2005 episode of SmackDown, claiming that they were tired of being \\"JBL's crash test dummies\\" and not getting enough respect. On June 30, Danny became one of the last minute trades in the 2005 WWE Draft Lottery, which saw him jump from SmackDown over to Raw. This left both men in singles competition in WWE on different brands. Basham would return to TV on the August 27 edition of Velocity under \\"The Bash Man\\" Doug Basham gimmick. The Bash Man came out to the ring wearing sunglasses, a shiny leather vest, and shiny wool pants. Basham continued to work squash matches under this unexplained gimmick sporadically over several months. While disappearing off WWE TV, Basham would return to OVW for several stints before signing a new deal with WWE in April 2006. Both Basham and Danny would reunite in WWE's revived ECW brand during July 2006 at several house shows before becoming on-screen unnamed masked \\"Security Enforcers\\" for ECW leader Paul Heyman. When Danny was injured with a torn biceps, he was replaced by Derek Neikirk, who continued Danny's role as the second masked enforcer. The Security Team's existence came into question after Heyman was removed from WWE television. The team stayed to compete in one handicap match against Bobby Lashley before disappearing from television themselves. On January 19, 2007, Basham was released by WWE along with a number of other wrestlers. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007)= Doug Basham or simply Basham and Danny Basham (now known as Damaja) debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on the May 10 episode of TNA Impact!. They were subsequently revealed to be allies of the villainous Christy Hemme, and at Sacrifice, Basham and Damaja defeated Hemme's rivals Kip James and Lance Hoyt in a tag team match. On August 15, Basham along with Damaja left TNA wrestling. =Europe, Return to OVW, and retirement (2008‚Äì2009)= In June 2008 Basham went to Ireland working for Irish Whip Wrestling. Later that year he went to England to work for various promotions. Basham returned to OVW for a one night appearance on October 10, 2008, and defeated JD Michaels with Al Barone by disqualification, due to Barone getting involved. He left Ireland and England in March 2009. He returned to North America for his last match was on September 5, 2009 for Pro Wrestling Fusion defeating Francisco Ciatso in Temple Terrance, Florida. Other media Basham appeared in WWE Day of Reckoning and WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006.

The tree is an important timber species in its native areas; it is used in the manufacture of musical instruments and fine furniture. Populations and genomic resources for genetic biodiversity maintenance in parts of its native range are threatened by overharvesting due to poor or absent conservation planning and by the species' low germination rates. It is a small tree, reaching 4‚Äì15 m tall, with grey bark and spiny shoots. The leaves are deciduous in the dry season, alternate, 6‚Äì22 cm long, pinnately compound, with 6‚Äì9 alternately arranged leaflets. The flowers are white and produced in dense clusters. The fruit is a pod 3‚Äì7 cm long, containing one to two seeds. Uses right The dense, lustrous wood ranges in colour from reddish to pure black. It is generally cut into small billets or logs with its sharply demarcated bright yellow-white sapwood left on to assist in the slow drying so as to prevent cracks developing. Good quality \\"A\\" grade African blackwood commands high prices on the commercial timber market. The timber is used mainly because of its machinability, density, dimensional stability, and moisture repellence. Those properties are particularly valued when used in woodwind instruments, principally clarinets, oboes, transverse flutes, piccolos, recorders, Highland pipes, and Northumbrian pipes.Most Expensive Wood, June 22, 2009 The Deering Banjo Company uses blackwood (\\"grenadilla\\") to construct the tone ring in its John Hartford-model banjo because it weighs less than brass or bronze tone rings, and that the wood \\"plays in\\" (improves in tone) with use. Furniture makers from the time of the Egyptians have valued this timber. A story states that it has even been used as ballast in trading ships and that some enterprising Northumbrian pipe makers used old discarded blackwood ballast to great effect. The German knife companies W√ºsthof, B√∂ker and J. A. Henckels sell knives with blackwood handles due to the wood's moisture repellent qualities. Due to overuse, the mpingo tree is severely threatened in Kenya and is needing attention in Tanzania and Mozambique. The trees are being harvested at an unsustainable rate, partly because of illegal smuggling of the wood into Kenya, but also because the tree takes upwards of 60 years to mature. =Relation to other woods= * African blackwood is no longer regarded as ebony, a name now reserved for a limited number of timbers yielded by the genus Diospyros; these are more of a matte appearance and are more brittle. * The genus Dalbergia yields other famous timbers such as Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra), Dalbergia cearensis and cocobolo (Dalbergia retusa). Names Other names by which the tree is known include babanus and grenadilla, which appear as loanwords in various local English dialects. Conservation There are multiple organisations involved in the conservation of African blackwood: the Mpingo Conservation & Development Initiative, the African Blackwood Conservation Project, and Clarinets for Conservation. The Mpingo Conservation & Development Initiative (MCDI, formerly the Mpingo Conservation Project) is involved in research, awareness raising and practical conservation of African blackwood. Conservation of Mpingo and its natural habitat can be achieved by ensuring that local people living in mpingo harvesting areas receive a fair share of the revenue created, thus providing them with an incentive to manage the habitat in an environmentally friendly manner. In order to achieve this, the MCDI is helping communities to get Forest Stewardship Certification. The African blackwood Conservation Project works around Mount Kilimanjaro replanting African blackwood trees, and in conservation education. It also works with adult and women's groups in the promotion of environmentally sound land uses. Clarinets for Conservation is based in Moshi, Tanzania and aims to raise awareness and promote conservation of Mpingo through music education. Students participate in an interdisciplinary program during the summer months that raises awareness of the value of Mpingo through musical performances, classroom instruction, and tree plantings at local secondary and primary schools. Small growers in Naples, Florida have been successful in growing African blackwood there. Growth habit in Florida yields taller, larger trees, and the rich soil combined with ample nutrients and long growing season yields timber of superior quality at more sustainable rates.

He later found the lucha libre style more to his liking, so he moved to The Great Sasuke's promotion, Michinoku Pro Wrestling. In that promotion, he joined with Taka Michinoku, Dick Togo, Men's Teioh and Shiryu in the Kai En Tai stable. Funaki also wrestled in the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) where he won the UWA World Middleweight Championship from El Pantera on March 19, 1997, in Japan. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment= Kai En Tai (1998‚Äì2001) In March 1998, Funaki, along with Teioh and Togo, joined the World Wrestling Federation. Initially, they feuded with Taka Michinoku and defeated him and his partner Justin Bradshaw in a 3-on-2 handicap match at Over the Edge: In Your House. They lost to Michinoku and The Headbangers at King of the Ring in a six-man tag team match. Michinoku eventually turned villainous and joined the group. At SummerSlam, Kai En Tai lost to Oddities members Kurrgan, Giant Silva and Golga in a handicap match. Over time, the stable turned into a tag team, as in 1999, Teioh and Togo (and manager Yamaguchi-san) were given their releases. Michinoku and Funaki were often used for comedic purposes, often having their pre-match promos dubbed‚Äîwhile Michinoku would \\"deliver\\" the majority of dialogue for the duo, Funaki would \\"respond\\" strongly with a simple \\"INDEED\\". At WrestleMania 2000, Funaki participated in a 15-minute hardcore battle royal for the WWF Hardcore Championship. Funaki pinned Viscera after a diving shoulder block from Bradshaw but he was later pinned by Rodney. Hardcore Holly ultimately won the match and became the official champion. At Unforgiven, Funaki once again participated in a hardcore battle royal which was won by the defending champion Steve Blackman. In 2001, Kai En Tai started participating in non-televised matches before pay-per-view events such as the Royal RumbleRoyal Rumble 2001 results and Judgment Day. SmackDown!'s No. 1 Announcer (2001‚Äì2003) Michinoku left the WWF in the fall of 2001, resulting in Funaki moving to singles competition. At Survivor Series, Funaki participated in an Immunity Battle Royal which was won by Test. In 2002, Funaki moved to the SmackDown! brand after WWF roster was split into two brands. He turned face and found himself as a lower card wrestler and adopted the gimmick of \\"SmackDown!'s number one announcer\\", performing backstage interviews between matches, while competing in the cruiserweight division. As part of SmackDown! brand, Funaki wrestled for most of the time on Velocity. At Rebellion, Funaki defeated Crash Holly.

Since that time Funaki, would regularly team with Scotty 2 Hotty during episodes of Velocity and SmackDown!. During one such Velocity taping, however, Funaki suffered a 2nd Grade concussion, where he was unconscious for just under two minutes. Funaki would resume wrestling later that year, forming a tag team of sorts with Scotty 2 Hotty, which was mainly used to put over debuting wrestlers or tag teams.

Kung Fu Naki (2008‚Äì2010) On October 10, 2008, Funaki revealed his full name to be \\"Kung Fu Naki\\" during a backstage segment with R-Truth. This was used as the basis for a gimmick change for Funaki; he then came to the ring dressed in a gi and tweaked his moveset to incorporate theatrical martial arts moves. His first match as Kung Fu Naki saw him scoring a pinfall win over Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Shelton Benjamin in a tag team match with R-Truth. Kung Fu Naki then defeated MVP in a singles match on the November 14, 2008 episode of SmackDown when The Great Khali interfered and distracted MVP. His first loss in the character was against WWE Champion Edge on the December 5, 2008 episode of SmackDown. He was inexplicably absent from WWE action until WrestleMania XXVI, where he took part in the 26 Man Battle Royal match, which was won by Yoshi Tatsu. On April 22, 2010, WWE released Funaki, ending his 12-year stint with the company. =Independent circuit (2010‚Äì2014)= After his WWE release, Pro Wrestling Zero1 announced they had signed Funaki to return to Japan and team with his former student Ikuto Hidaka.

He was born in Bristol, where his father James Macready Chute (1856-1912) ran the dynastic family theatre. He was educated at Downside School, and the Slade Art School in London. He was an intimate and influential friend of Stanley Spencer, from 1915. From 1918 became a close colleague, assistant and \\"beloved brother\\" of Eric Gill and was co-founder of The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, publishing poetry in The Game, the community's magazine. His mother, Abigail Philomena, n√©e Hennessy (1855-1931), was a principal patron of the Guild in its early days. He became a convinced distributist and follower of Vincent McNabb, to whom he and Eric Gill were introduced in 1914 by the influential same-sex couple Marc-Andre Raffalovich and John Gray. He started in 1921 to study for the priesthood, in Fribourg. Later Desmond moved for his health to Rapallo, Italy, where he was a close friend of Max Beerbohm and Ezra Pound, and one of the Tigullian Circle clique around him. He tutored Mary de Rachewiltz, Pound's daughter with Olga Rudge, and supported both of them when Pound was arrested and deported by the US army. During the war, Desmond was interned at Bobbio, where he taught English to the local boys, and where he remained until the end of the war. His radio play Poets in Paradise was broadcast by the BBC in 1955. He died and was buried in Rapallo, although a memorial designed by Gill stands in Canford Cemetery, Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol. Some of his papers are held in the Eric Gill Collection at Chichester, and others by his relation, David Charles Manners.

Baserunners are generally permitted to run from base to base without being physically blocked or hindered by a fielder. The only time that a fielder is not obligated to \\"get out of the way\\" of a baserunner is when the fielder is fielding a hit ball or in possession of the ball. Definition Official Baseball Rule 2.00 defines obstruction as: The comment to Rule 7.09(j) adds that High school and college versions of the rule also add rules against malicious or flagrant contact. Types of obstruction and corresponding penalties Any case of obstruction falls into one of two categories generally called type \\"A\\" and type \\"B\\", after the subsection of Rule 7.06, in which each type of obstruction, and the corresponding penalties, are described. Type A: Type B: Common misconceptions There need not be physical contact for obstruction to be called; rather, if a fielder causes the runner to alter his normal running path, or deliberately blocks his view of the plate, he can be guilty of obstruction.Marc Topkin, About the other game- ending obstruction call, involving Devil Rays and Mariners , Tampa Bay Times (October 27, 2013). Retrieved on October 28, 2013. Obstruction is not the same as interference; obstruction is typically committed by a defensive player against an offensive player, while interference is typically committed by an offensive player against a defensive player. When a fielder hinders a baserunner, baseball commentators (including the announcers of the 2013 game discussed below) will mistakenly refer to obstruction as interference. Notable cases of obstruction On August 6, 2004, a game between the Seattle Mariners and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Tropicana Field ended with a Devil Rays victory on an obstruction call. With one out and the score tied 1-1 in the bottom of the tenth inning, the Devil Rays' Carl Crawford was taking a lead off of third base when teammate Tino Martinez hit a fly ball toward Mariners left fielder Ra√∫l Iba√±ez. Crawford went back to third base as if he was going to consider tagging up and trying to score after the ball was caught. Mariners shortstop Jos√© L√≥pez moved to a spot that was between Crawford and Iba√±ez. Iba√±ez caught the ball, and Crawford bluffed a run toward home; he then stopped and was heading back toward third base as Iba√±ez's throw sailed toward home plate. However, third base umpire Paul Emmel ruled that L√≥pez had blocked Crawford's view of left fielder Iba√±ez, thus preventing Crawford from seeing when the ball was caught and when he could leave third base and head toward home plate. Emmel called obstruction on the ground that L√≥pez's action, within the language of the rule, had \\"impede[d] the progress of\\" Crawford by not letting him see precisely when it was safe for him to leave the base. Emmel awarded Crawford home plate, and that was the winning run.Associated Press, Mariners find a new way to lose, reprinted in the Ellensburg Daily Record (August 7, 2004). Retrieved on October 28, 2013. The play involved \\"Type A\\" obstruction, as a play was being made on Crawford at the time of the obstruction because Iba√±ez threw the ball home to prevent him from scoring. The play also demonstrated how it is not necessary for a fielder to make physical contact with a runner or physically impede the runner's running path to be called for obstruction. On October 4, 2003, in Game 3 of the 2003 American League Division Series between the Oakland A's and the Red Sox, the A's Miguel Tejada was called out after he apparently misunderstood the obstruction rule. Tejada was on second base when teammate Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez hit a ground ball into left field for a hit. Tejada rounded third and collided with Red Sox third baseman Bill Mueller, who was trying to get into position to receive a throw from left fielder Manny Ramirez. Umpire Bill Welke called obstruction. Incorrectly thinking that the play was over and that he was entitled to home plate automatically, Tejada slowed to a jog and headed toward home. The Red Sox, however, threw the ball to catcher Jason Varitek who caught the ball long before Tejada reached home and easily tagged him out. Tejada had failed to realize that, because a play was not being made on him at the time of Mueller's obstruction, the obstruction was \\"Type B\\" obstruction. Therefore, under Rule 7.06(b), Welke's call was only preliminary, the ball was still live, and the play was supposed to \\"proceed until no further action [was] possible,\\" at which point the umpires would judge whether Tejada would have scored if the obstruction had not occurred. Tejada was called out after Varitek tagged him with the live ball because, in light of his jogging, the umpires could not say that he would have scored if the obstruction had not occurred.Peter E. Meltzer, So You Think You Know Baseball?: A Fan's Guide to the Official Rules ¬ß 12.2 (2013). On October 26, 2013, Game 3 of the 2013 World Series was decided by a controversial obstruction call. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Allen Craig of the St. Louis Cardinals was impeded by Boston Red Sox third-baseman Will Middlebrooks, who had fallen to the ground trying to catch a wild throw from Red Sox catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia. As a result, the third-base umpire, Jim Joyce, ruled obstruction, and thus Craig was awarded home plate and the Cardinals won the game 5‚Äì4. This play involved \\"Type B\\" obstruction, because no play was being made on Craig at the time that the obstruction occurred. Saltalamacchia's throw had already gone into left field before Craig tripped over Middlebrooks's body while trying to head home.Video of the final play of Game 3 of the 2013 World Series, from YouTube. Retrieved on February 13, 2014. The difference between the play on Tejada and the play that ended Game 3 of the 2013 World Series was that, in the 2013 game, Allen Craig got up after he tripped over Middlebrooks and ran hard toward home plate, where he was tagged by catcher Saltalamacchia just before he slid into the plate. Home plate umpire Dana DeMuth then made the final call that Craig was safe because he would have scored if Middlebrooks's obstruction had not occurred. According to David Smith, baseball historian and founder of Retrosheet, as of October 2013, the 2004 and 2013 games described above were the only games that ever ended on an obstruction call. History The rule against obstruction was first formalized as part of the 1856 version of the National Association of Base Ball Players rules. The current language of the Official Rules was introduced in 1962. Obstruction calls almost invariably involve accidental contact. The rules against obstruction effectively ensure that blocking and tackling characteristic of American football are not part of baseball at any level.

He is best known for his work with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) between 1999 and 2001 and with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for several years in the 2000s. He has also worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He currently wrestles for Atomic Revolutionary Wrestling (ARW) where he is the current ARW Heavyweight Champion in his 3rd reign. Moore befriended Matt and Jeff Hardy as a child, and they later trained him to wrestle. He debuted in 1995, and competed for several North Carolina-based promotions, winning several Light Heavyweight Championships. He also wrestled for the Hardys' promotion, Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA), where he won the OMEGA Light Heavyweight Championship twice and the OMEGA New Frontiers Championship once. In 1999, he signed with WCW, and became part of 3 Count, a boy band parody. The three members of 3 Count jointly won the WCW Hardcore Championship in 2000. In 2001, he briefly held the NWA Wildside Tag Team Championship with Shane Helms. He later joined the then-WWF in 2001, and was assigned to Heartland Wrestling Association, a developmental territory, where he won the HWA Tag Team Championship with Evan Karagias. After debuting on the SmackDown brand, he became a follower of 'Mattitude' and appeared regularly as Matt Hardy's sidekick. Between late 2003 and 2005, Moore was used mainly in WWE's cruiserweight division, until his release in July 2005. After a stint on the independent circuit, Moore joined TNA in December 2005. In March 2006, he re-signed with WWE, initially appearing on the ECW brand, before returning to SmackDown in 2007. He formed a tag team with Jimmy Wang Yang, and the pair challenged unsuccessfully for the WWE Tag Team Championship on several occasions. Following his release in August 2008, he once again returned to the independent circuit, before rejoining TNA in January 2010. He soon formed a tag team, known as Ink Inc., with Jesse Neal in April. Aside from wrestling, Moore is also a tattoo artist, and owned a tattoo parlor known as Gas Chamber Ink in Southern Pines, North Carolina. He is also a musician, having written his own entrance music, and was part of the band Peroxwhy?gen with Jeff Hardy. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1995‚Äì1999)= Moore befriended Matt and Jeff Hardy as a child and competed in their own backyard wrestling circuit. After the Hardy brothers began wrestling professionally, they trained Moore and he debuted on April 8, 1995 against Jeff. Moore began working on the independent circuit, wrestling for the North Carolina-based Southern Championship Wrestling and National Championship Wrestling promotions as \\"Kid Dynamo\\", and won the Light Heavyweight Championship in both. In addition, he frequently wrestled for Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA), the promotion operated by the Hardys. In OMEGA, he won the OMEGA New Frontiers Championship once, and the OMEGA Light Heavyweight Championship on two occasions. During his time in OMEGA, he met Gregory Shane Helms, and the pair later formed the Bad Street Boys with Christian York and Joey Matthews in NWA Worldwide. In the late 1990s, Moore began wrestling for the Tennessee-based Music City Wrestling promotion. =World Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2001)= In 1999, Moore was hired by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) by Chris Kanyon, who had been granted the authority to employ twenty-one young cruiserweights for the Atlanta-based promotion. He was placed in a faction known as \\"3 Count\\" by Jimmy Hart. 3 Count, which consisted of Moore, Evan Karagias and Shane Helms, was a trio of young male wrestlers who utilized a boy band gimmick, parodying bands like the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. 3 Count debuted in WCW in November 1999. and they began lip synching the song \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Heart\\" in the ring before their matches. On the February 28, 2000 episode of WCW Monday Nitro in Minneapolis, Minnesota, all three members of 3 Count defeated Brian Knobs to win the WCW Hardcore Championship with all 3 members of the team simultaneously pinning him. 3 Count reigned as \\"co-champions\\" until March 19, at Uncensored where Knobs regained the title by pinning all three men consecutively. 3 Count were not involved in the Millionaire's Club versus The New Blood angle that took place in mid-2000 because Helms was legitimately sidelined with a broken nose. When the team reconvened late in the summer of 2000, they began performing a new song, \\"Dance With 3 Count\\". In storyline, Ultimate Fighting Championship mixed martial artist Tank Abbott became an avid fan of 3 Count, and he began protecting them during their performances, attacking anyone who disrupted them, eventually acting as their talent manager and occasional inserting himself as a back-up dancer. 3 Count were involved with a long-running feud (scripted rivalry) with The Jung Dragons, with the Dragons attempting to steal 3 Count's fictional recording contract. This led to a ladder match between the two teams at New Blood Rising, which 3 Count won due to Abbott's interference. As a result, Abbott claimed that he should be the lead singer of 3 Count, and was kicked out by the other three members, leading to a feud. Following this, 3 Count briefly feuded with Misfits In Action. In late 2000, 3 Count began to fall apart, with Moore and Helms kicking Karagias out of the group for continually stealing the spotlight. Karagias joined forces with former Jung Dragons member Jamie Knoble and the three teams met in a Triangle match at Mayhem, which 3 Count won. At Starrcade, the six men faced off in a ladder match for the number contendership to the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. Both Moore and Helms grabbed the contract at the same time, and later wrestled for the opportunity to face the champion, which Helms won. In 2001, Moore and Helms briefly appeared in NWA Wildside, where they held the NWA Wildside Tag Team Championship for a single day, after defeating Suicidal Tendencies (John Phoenix and Adam Jacobs) on January 19, 2001. Moore and Helms both participated in a cruiserweight elimination match at SuperBrawl Revenge on February 18, in which Helms eliminated Moore and went on to win the match. Following the match, Moore and former partner Karagias attacked Helms. Moore and Karagias joined forces once again to take part in a tournament for the WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship, but were eliminated by Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio, Jr.. =World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (2001‚Äì2005)= In March 2001, the World Wrestling Federation purchased WCW, which included Moore's contract. Moore was assigned to the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA), a Louisville-based WWF developmental territory. There, he teamed with Evan Karagias, and the two won the HWA Tag Team Championship on October 13, 2001, by defeating Dean and Chet Jablonski. They held the championship for a month, before losing it to The Island Boyz on November 14. In early 2002, Moore won the HWA Cruiserweight Championship on two occasions. Moore in March 2003 at WWE Fan Axxess In July 2002, Moore was assigned to the SmackDown! brand, initially appearing on Velocity. In December, Moore became a heel (villainous) acolyte of Matt Hardy, who had begun proselytizing a philosophy known as \\"Mattitude\\" and calling himself \\"Matt Hardy Version 1.0\\". Moore became a \\"Mattitude Follower\\" (abbreviated \\"MF'er\\") and started dressing like Hardy, accompanying him to ringside and interfering in his matches. Moore helped Hardy to lose several pounds in order to qualify for a WWE Cruiserweight Championship match at No Way Out. During the championship match, Moore distracted champion Billy Kidman to enable Hardy to get the win and the championship. On April 24, Crash Holly was revealed as the newest MF'er. He was subordinate to Moore and, as such, was referred to as a \\"Moore-on\\". When Hardy was displeased with either Moore or Holly, he would physically attack them. Holly was later released from WWE on June 30. On September 23, Moore and Hardy challenged Los Guerreros for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful. Moore and Hardy continued to work together until November 17, when Hardy left SmackDown! and joined the Raw brand. As a result, Paul Heyman, SmackDown!'s then-general manager, decided to punish Hardy vicariously for leaving his show by forcing Moore to face a series of much larger opponents. In successive weeks, Moore was squashed by Matt Morgan, Nathan Jones, and The Big Show before unexpectedly defeating A-Train in an upset on the December 11 episode of SmackDown!. The following week, WWE Champion Brock Lesnar was scheduled to defend the championship against a wrestler chosen by a lottery machine, which produced Moore's name. After defeating Moore, Lesnar revealed that the process had been rigged, and Moore's name was on all the balls. Immediately afterward, Moore teamed with Hardcore Holly to defeat A-Train and Morgan, earning Holly a championship match against Lesnar. In 2004, at WrestleMania XX Moore took part in a \\"Cruiserweight Open\\" for the Cruiserweight Championship, but was eliminated by √öltimo Drag√≥n. His next high profile appearance was on the July 8 episode of SmackDown!, which saw Moore wrestle under a mask as \\"El Gran Luchadore\\" to face John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield (JBL) in the match for the WWE Championship. Initially Moore was dominated by his much larger opponent, but a second Luchadore (the disguised Eddie Guerrero) took Moore's place, prompting Layfield to run away and giving Moore the victory by countout. For the remainder of 2004 and early 2005, Moore competed in the cruiserweight division and on Velocity. Moore received a WWE Championship match on the December 30, 2004 episode of SmackDown, but was quickly defeated by JBL. Moore appeared at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February 2005, competing in a gauntlet match for the Cruiserweight Championship, but was eliminated by Paul London. On March 21 he suffered a concussion and whiplash after his Hummer was involved in a head-on collision with a vehicle driven by an inebriated United States Army Sergeant in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He quickly recovered from his injuries, but was released by WWE on July 5. =Independent circuit (2005‚Äì2006)= Moore returned to the independent circuit soon thereafter, although the no-compete clause in his contract (which prohibits WWE employees who are fired or who negotiate a contract release from appearing on television within a given time period) did not expire until November 1 of that year. Moore appeared at an AWA Superstars of Wrestling show, competing in a tournament for the WSL World Light Heavyweight Championship. Moore defeated Dexter Poindexter, Ricky Landell, and \\"Amazing\\" N8 Mattson before losing to \\"Krazy K\\" Kirby Mack in the finals. Over the next few months he wrestled Davey Richards at a Pro Wrestling WAR event, J.J. Perez at an All Pro Wrestling show, and Sonjay Dutt at Universal Uproar. He also wrestled A.J. Styles on a United Wrestling Association charity show on February 2, 2006. During this time, Moore opened a professional wrestling school known as the \\"School of Punk\\". =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005‚Äì2006)= Moore competing in TNA in March 2006 Moore made his Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) television debut on the December 17 episode of Impact!, appearing in the rafters of the Impact Zone and holding a sign reading \\"X Division needs to get Punk'd\\". Upon joining the roster, he gained the nickname the \\"Prince of Punk\\". He appeared again in the rafters on the following episode of Impact!. On the December 31 episode, Moore was seen standing on the stage once again, before he attacked A.J. Styles during a tag team match on the special midnight episode of Impact!, preventing him from winning the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Christopher Daniels. This attack prompted a feud between Moore and Styles, with Moore stalking Styles, attacking him and stealing his \\"Mr. TNA\\" award plaque. This led to a street fight between the two, which Moore won. On the February 18 episode of Impact!, Moore faced Roderick Strong and Jay Lethal in a three-way match for a place on Team USA, but the match was won by Lethal. Moore then teamed with Samoa Joe to defeat Styles and Daniels. Moore's final match as part of TNA aired on the March 18 episode of Impact!, when he, America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) and Alex Shelley lost to Styles, Daniels, Ron Killings, and Rhino. =Return to WWE (2006‚Äì2008)= On March 17, 2006, WWE released an interview with Moore talking about his imminent return to the company. In July 2006, Moore began appearing as part of WWE's ECW brand, making his first appearances in vignettes calling himself \\"The Reject\\". His in-ring debut was a loss to CM Punk on September 12, a week before Punk had confronted Moore and called him a \\"poser\\" before slapping him. After one more loss to Punk, Moore made only sporadic appearances throughout the rest of 2006 and early 2007, losing each time. On the February 16, 2007 episode of SmackDown! Moore suddenly switched brands, appearing in an in-ring brawl with other SmackDown! cruiserweights, which was a prelude to a Cruiserweight Open at No Way Out. Moore was eliminated from the Cruiserweight Open by the defending WWE Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms. Moore then established himself as a fan favorite by teaming with Scotty 2 Hotty and Jimmy Wang Yang to defeat Helms, Chavo Guerrero, and Daivari in a six-man tag team match. Following a hiatus from television, Moore returned on the June 15 episode of SmackDown!, competing in a fatal four-way number one contender match for the Cruiserweight Championship, which was won by Wang Yang and also involved Daivari and Jamie Noble. The following week, Moore teamed with Wang Yang in a losing effort against Guerrero and Noble. Moore competed in the 20-man battle royal for the World Heavyweight Championship in July, but was the third person to be eliminated. He also competed in the \\"Cruiserweight Open\\" at The Great American Bash along with Noble, Funaki, Wang Yang, and Guerrero. The match was inadvertently won by Hornswoggle. He also faced Noble and Guerrero, in losing efforts. Moore began feuding with Noble, appearing in several backstage vignettes together, where he mocked Noble for his obsession with Hornswoggle. Moore defeated Noble on the September 14 episode of SmackDown!, by pretending that Hornswoggle was at ringside, distracting Noble and allowing Moore to pin him for the victory. In a rematch two weeks later, Noble pinned Moore. In October 2007, Moore formed a tag team with Yang, with the two defeating Deuce 'n Domino. They later competed in a tag team battle royal to determine the number one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship on the November 9 episode of SmackDown, but were the second team eliminated. In December, Moore and Yang challenged John Morrison and The Miz for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful, igniting a feud between the two teams. The following week on ECW, Moore and Yang defeated Morrison and The Miz in a non-title match, to earn a rematch for the championship. On January 1, 2008, Moore and Wang Yang once again beat Morrison and the Miz, this time in a six- person tag team match also involving Layla and Kelly Kelly. The following week, in a Fifteen Minutes of Fame Match, Moore and Wang Yang tied the champions on pinfalls, meaning Miz and Morrison retained the championship.

On the February 15 episode of SmackDown, Moore, Yang, and Jesse and Festus defeated Deuce 'n Domino and Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder in an eight-man tag team match on SmackDown. In April, Moore and Yang reignited their feud with Morrison and The Miz, losing to them twice in tag team encounters. Yang and Moore went on to win singles matches against Morrison and The Miz respectively, earning another match for the WWE Tag Team Championship on the May 2 episode of SmackDown, but were unsuccessful once again. After this feud ended, Moore was rarely utilized. On August 8, 2008, WWE announced that Moore had been released from his WWE contract. =Return to the independent circuit (2008‚Äì2009)= On September 28, 2008, Moore won the World Stars of Wrestling World Championship by defeating Joe E.

During November, Moore participated in the Hulkamania tour of Australia, where he took part in a best of three match series for a prize of US$25,000 with Spartan 3000. Spartan won the first match on November 21, and Moore won the second on November 24. The rubber match ended in a draw on November 26, resulting in a ladder match for the final match of the tour, which Spartan won. =Return to TNA (2010‚Äì2012)= Moore posing in the ring in April 2010 On the first live Monday edition of Impact! on January 4, 2010, Moore made his return to TNA by celebrating backstage with Jeff Hardy, after Hardy had also made his return to the company. On February 19, Dixie Carter confirmed that Moore had signed a new contract with TNA. On the March 8 episode of Impact!, Moore attacked the TNA X Division Champion Doug Williams, and Eric Bischoff announced that Moore would face Williams for the X Division Championship at Destination X.

Moore's first victory since his return to TNA came on the March 29 episode of Impact! in a tag team match when he pinned Brian Kendrick. At Lockdown Moore received another shot at the now vacant X Division Championship in a three-way steel cage match, where he faced Homicide and the eventual winner of the match, Kazarian. In April, Moore insulted the TNA World Tag Team Champion Matt Morgan, provoking a rivalry between the two. The following week Morgan cost Moore his shot at the TNA X Division Championship, and later attacked his tag team partner with Jesse Neal. Moore aided Neal, prompting the pair to form a tag team known as Ink Inc.. At Sacrifice Ink Inc. failed in their attempt to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship from The Band (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall), when Neal's trainer Brother Ray interfered in the match and attacked Neal. The following month, on the June 17 episode of Impact!, Ink Inc. defeated The Band (Kevin Nash and Eric Young) to advance to the finals of a tournament for the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship. In the final, Ink Inc. was defeated by Beer Money, Inc. when Brother Ray attacked Neal backstage prior to the match. At Bound for Glory, Ink Inc. defeated Eric Young and Orlando Jordan.

The following month at Sacrifice, Ink Inc. was defeated by Mexican America (Anarquia and Hernandez). During the match, Neal suffered a neck injury, which sidelined him for the next four months. Ink Inc. in July 2010 As a result, Moore returned to singles competition and on July 10 at Destination X, Moore participated in his first Ultimate X match, for a shot at the X Division Championship, but was defeated by Alex Shelley in the match, which also included Amazing Red and Robbie E. Ink Inc. returned on the September 22 episode of Impact Wrestling, attacking Mexican America, now the TNA World Tag Team Champions, at a tattoo parlour. On the October 13 episode of Impact Wrestling, Toxxin aligned herself with Ink Inc. by saving them from Mexican America. On October 16, during the Bound for Glory pre-show, Ink Inc. unsuccessfully challenged Mexican America for the TNA World Tag Team Championship and at Turning Point the following month, they again failed to win the championship in a six-person tag team match, which also included Toxxin and Mexican America's Sarita. In December, Neal parted ways with TNA, effectively dissolving Ink Inc. On the December 22 episode of Impact Wrestling, Moore teamed up with Anarquia in the Wild Card Tournament but lost to Eric Young and ODB. Following a brief hiatus, Moore returned on February 12, 2012, at Against All Odds, answering Robbie E's open invitational and unsuccessfully challenging him for the TNA Television Championship. On May 31, Moore announced that he would not be returning to TNA due to a neck injury. =Third return to the independent circuit (2012‚Äìpresent)= After leaving TNA in 2012, Moore did not wrestle for approximately two years, and on July 6, 2014, he announced on Twitter that he is finished with in-ring competition.

It lies towards the east of the town of Falkirk, north of the Union Canal, which runs adjacent to the village. Due to its situation in Central Scotland, many locations can be seen from Polmont, ranging from the Ochil Hills and the River Forth, to Cairnpapple Hill. Although giving its name to Polmont Young Offenders Institution, the prison is in fact in Reddingmuirhead.  History  The name Polmont derives from the Scottish Gaelic term Poll-Mhonadh, which translates into English as Pool of the Hill. Old Polmont was situated on a raised beach overlooking the Firth of Forth and the Ochils. There were two Roman temporary marching camps, one on either side of what is now Grangemouth Golf Course: on the western side was Little Kerse, and on the eastern side was Polmont Hill. Nearby, at Mumrills, was the largest fort on the Roman Antonine Wall. This fort, embankment and water source has been marked out and can be visited in Polmont Woods, close to the M9 motorway. Polmont was originally included within the parish of Falkirk, but was severed under the authority of the Court of Teinds (teind is the Scots word for tithe), and erected into an independent parish, in 1724. Nothing of the early history of Polmont has been recorded.map.http://maps.nls.uk/atlas/thomson/view/?rsid=74400119&sid;=74400119‚à£=453 http://maps.nls.uk/atlas/thomson/view/?rsid=74401093&sid;=74401093‚à£=880 New Polmont, was built along the Great North Road (A9), south of Old Polmont, and was originally called Bennetstown/Bennestone named after the Laird of Whyteside (Mr Bennet) whose land it was built on.https://falkirklocalhistory.club/around-and-about-the-area/places/polmont- and-brighton Apart from housing, agricultural workshops and stores, it also had three public houses (The Crown, The Red Lion and The Black Bull, of which only The Black Bull remains to this day).Map of Polmont 1860. The village slowly expanded after the second world war with housing being built on land of former estates of Millfield, Polmont Park, and Polmont House. From the mid 1970's the population significantly expanded when housing was built on the Gilston Estate, whereupon the village was re-designated as a dormitory town. During World War II, The now demolished St Margaret's School for girls was used by the Polish forces as a signals training school and soldiers from various Polish units were assigned to learn the trade of signalling. Notable residents *John Gibb Dunlop (1844-1913) Director of John Brown and Company creator of both RMS Lusitania and RMS Aquitania *Gilbert Laurie of Polmont (1729-1809), Lord Provost of Edinburgh *Johan Theodor Salvesen (1820-1865), joint founder of Christian Salvesen  Politics  Polmont is within the jurisdiction of Falkirk Council, although the suggestion of east Polmont changing hands for the purposes of the Westminster Parliamentary Constituency to Linlithgow and East Falkirk arose, but was soon discounted . In May 2007, the Polmont area merged as part of an expanded Lower Braes seat, as proposed for Falkirk Council by the Scottish Executive. Lord Polmont is a subsidiary title of the Duke of Hamilton. This title was originally given to the 2nd Duke of Hamilton in 1639. One of the current councillors for Polmont (and the rest of the Lower Braes Ward) in Falkirk Council is Scottish Conservative Councillor Malcolm Nicol, who has held the role since 2000 following the death of his predecessor Frank Hodge. He previously represented a seat in Grangemouth, originally being elected in 1983. SNP Councillor Steven Jackson has also represented Polmont, which is part of the larger Lower Braes Ward, since May 2007, being elected for the first time through the Single Transferable Vote system. Polmont is unusual for a town in the Falkirk area in that a local by-election in 2000 saw a Conservative candidate returned with over half of the popular vote.  Economy  The economy of Polmont is based mainly upon relatively small scale private enterprise, such as pubs, cafes, hotels, take-aways and convenience stores. The majority of these are based in or around Polmont shopping centre, the focal point of local custom. Agriculture is also a central industry, with arable land consuming a sizeable proportion of the area. Polmont is home to the controversial Avondale Landfill, a large employer on the east of the village. Due to the proximity to Grangemouth, a number of the population work at the Grangemouth refineries and port. Few of the population work in Polmont itself, leaving it something of a commuter town, largely to Edinburgh and Glasgow. There are several hotels in the area, with the most well known being the Inchyra Grange, a redevelopment from one of the area's many former mansions.  Transport  Inchyra Grange Hotel, a redevelopment of one of the area's former mansions Polmont railway station is located on the Edinburgh to Glasgow railway line. In 1984 a train collided with a cow that had strayed onto the rail line near Polmont. The crash left 13 people dead and 61 others injured. The M9 motorway runs through the village between Polmont and Old Polmont, with two exit points on the east and west sides. There are numerous bus stops throughout the village, primarily situated on Polmont Main Street, which provide direct bus services to Edinburgh, Falkirk and Stirling. The nearest airport, Edinburgh Airport, is located approximately to the east. Polmont Old Parish Church  Culture  Polmont Parish Church was designed by John Tait in 1844. Polmont is a parish and its religious community is primarily Christian, being home to a Church of Scotland in Old Polmont. The area also has a Christian denominational presence in the form of the Church of the Brethren and the Religious Society of Friends. Scottish rock band Glasvegas have a song entitled 'Polmont On My Mind' on their debut album 'Glasvegas'. Parkhill House and grounds were used as a location in the fourth season of Outlander (TV series)http://www.outlanderlocations.com/locations/season-four-locations/ The grounds of the former Millfield House contain the only living examples of several exotic trees to be found in Europe.  Sport  =Football= Polmont has an amateur football club. Since the 2014-15 season they have played in Division One Stirling & District AFA. The club play their home games at Meadowbank Bank, St. Margaret's in the east of the village. There was once a junior club representing the area but the club only lasted a few years. Farmland in Polmont looking towards Grangemouth industry The most famous sporting export of Polmont is Alex Raisbeck, who spent several years captaining Liverpool. He also represented Scotland on eight occasions, and was considered to have been one of the finest players of his generation, dating back to 1898. He captained Liverpool to their first ever English championship title in 1901 and did so again five years later. The highest-profile Polmontarian currently playing at senior level is Derek Niven, formerly of Chesterfield. =Other sports= Despite its name, Grangemouth Golf Club is located on the outskirts of Polmont. Within the boundaries of Grangemouth Golf Club is Millhall Reservoir, which is now a fishery. To the east of the clubhouse is Polmont Ski Centre, which includes an artificial ski slope.

He was born in Brantford, Ontario, and is best known as a member of the Group of Seven who pioneered a distinctly Canadian painting style in the early twentieth century. A. Y. Jackson has been quoted as saying that Harris provided the stimulus for the Group of Seven. During the 1920s, Harris' works became more abstract and simplified, especially his stark landscapes of the Canadian north and Arctic. He also stopped signing and dating his works so that people would judge his works on their own merit and not by the artist or when they were painted. In 1969, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. Life =Early years= Lawren Stewart Harris was born on October 23, 1885 in Brantford, Ontario. The son of Thomas Morgan Harris and Anna Stewart, Harris was an heir to the Massey-Harris fortune. The wealth and status of the family afforded Harris a privileged youth, which allowed him to focus on his painting career. He attended Central Technical School and St. Andrew's College. From 1904 to 1908 he studied in Berlin. He was interested in philosophy and Eastern thought. Later, he became involved in Theosophy and joined the Toronto Lodge of the International Theosophical Society. Harris went on to marry Beatrice (Trixie) Phillips on January 20, 1910, and together had three children (Lawren P. Harris, Margaret Anne Harris, Howard K. Harris) born in the first decade of their marriage. Soon after meeting and becoming friends with J. E. H. MacDonald in 1911, they together formed the famous Group of Seven. He financed the construction of a studio building in Toronto with friend James MacCallum. The studio provided artists with cheap or free space where they worked. =Career= Group of seven artists: Frederick Varley, A. Y. Jackson, Lawren Harris, Barker Fairley, Frank Johnston (artist), Arthur Lismer, and J. E. H. MacDonald Lawren Harris in his Vancouver studio, circa 1944. In 1918 and 1919, Harris financed boxcar trips for the artists of the Group of Seven to the Algoma region, travelling along the Algoma Central Railway and painting in areas such as the Montreal River and Agawa Canyon. In the fall of 1921, Harris ventured beyond Algoma to Lake Superior's North Shore, where he would return annually for the next seven years. While his Algoma and urban paintings of the late 1910s and early 1920s were characterized by rich, bright colours and decorative composition motifs, the discovery of Lake Superior subject material catalyzed a transition to a more austere, simplified style, with limited palettes - often jewel colours with a range of neutral tones. In 1924, a sketching trip with A.Y. Jackson to Jasper National Park in the Canadian Rockies marked the beginning of Harris' mountain subjects, which he continued to explore with annual sketching trips until 1929, exploring areas around Banff National Park, Yoho National Park and Mount Robson Provincial Park. In 1930, Harris went on his last extended sketching trip, travelling to the Arctic aboard the supply ship SS. Beothic for two months, during which time he completed over 50 sketches. The resulting Arctic canvases that he developed from the oil panels marked the end of his landscape period, and from 1935 on, Harris enthusiastically embraced abstract painting. After the disbanding of the Group of Seven in 1933, Harris and the other surviving members including A. J. Casson, Arthur Lismer, A. Y. Jackson, and Franklin Carmichael, were instrumental in forming its successor, the larger national group, the Canadian Group of Painters. =Personal life= On January 20, 1910, Harris married Beatrice (Trixie) Phillips. The couple had three children. Harris later fell in love with Bess, the wife of his school-time friend, F.B. Housser. Harris and Bess fell in love, but saw no way forward. For the two to divorce their spouses and marry would cause an outrage. Harris eventually left his wife of 24 years, Trixie, and his three children, and married Bess Housser in 1934. He was threatened with charges of bigamy by Trixie‚Äôs family because of his actions. Later that year he and Bess left their home and moved to the United States. In 1940 they moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. Bess died in 1969. =Death= Harris died in Vancouver in 1970, at the age of 84, as a well-known artist. He was buried on the grounds of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, where his work is now held. Media In 2016 a film about Harris's life, Where the Universe Sings, was produced by TV Ontario. It was created by filmmaker Peter Raymont and directed by Nancy Lang.\\"Lawren Harris film captures acclaimed painter‚Äôs life and times\\".

He served as the 11th President of Pakistan from 2008 to 2013, the first president born after Partition. He is member of National Assembly of Pakistan since August 2018. The son of Hakim Ali Zardari, a landowner from Sindh, Zardari rose to prominence after his marriage to Benazir Bhutto in 1987, who became the Prime Minister of Pakistan after her election in 1988. When Bhutto's government was dismissed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1990, Zardari was widely criticized for involvement in corruption scandals that led to its collapse. When Bhutto was reelected in 1993, Zardari served as Federal Investment Minister and Chairperson of Pakistan Environmental Protection Council. Following increasing tensions between Bhutto's brother Murtaza and Zardari, Murtaza was killed in a police encounter in Karachi on 20 September 1996. Bhutto's government was dismissed a month later by President Farooq Leghari, while Zardari was arrested and indicted for Murtaza's murder as well as corruption charges.\\"Pakistan ex-premier's spouse indicted for murder\\". The New York Times. 6 July 1997.Burns, John F (5 November 1996). \\"Pakistan's Premier Bhutto is put under house arrest\\". The New York Times Although incarcerated, he nominally served in Parliament after being elected to the National Assembly in 1990 and Senate in 1997. He was released from jail in 2004 and went into self- exile to Dubai, but returned when Bhutto was assassinated on 27 December 2007. As the new Co-Chairman of the PPP, he led his party to victory in the 2008 general elections. He spearheaded a coalition that forced military ruler Pervez Musharraf to resign, and was elected President on 6 September 2008. He was acquitted of various criminal charges the same year. As president, Zardari remained a strong American ally in the war in Afghanistan, despite prevalent public disapproval of the United States following the Raymond Davis incident and the Nato attack in Salala in 2011. Domestically, Zardari achieved the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 2010, which constitutionally reduced his presidential powers. His attempt to prevent the reinstatement of Supreme Court judges failed in the face of massive protests led by his political rival Nawaz Sharif. The restored Supreme Court dismissed the PPP's elected Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani for contempt in 2012 after Gillani refused to write to the Government of Switzerland to reopen corruption cases against Zardari. Zardari's tenure was also criticised for mishandling nationwide floods in 2010, and growing terrorist violence. Following multiple bombings of Hazaras in Quetta in early 2013, Zardari dismissed his provincial government in Balochistan. Towards the end of his term, Zardari recorded abysmally low approval ratings, ranging from 11 to 14%. After the PPP was heavily defeated in the 2013 general election, Zardari became the country's first elected president to complete his constitutional term on 9 September 2013. His legacy remains divisive, with political observers accusing his administration of corruption and cronyism. Early life and education Zardari was born on 26 July 1955 in Karachi, Sindh in the Zardari family. He is of Baloch origin, belonging to a Jat clan of the Sindhi-speaking Zardari tribe. He is the only son of Hakim Ali Zardari, a tribal chief and prominent landowner, and Bilquis Sultana Zardari. His paternal grandmother was of Iraqi descent, while his mother was the granddaughter of Hassan Ali Effendi, a Sindhi educationist who is known as the founder of the Sindh Madressatul Islam. In his youth, he enjoyed polo and boxing. He led a polo team known as the Zardari Four. His father owned Bambino‚Äîa famous cinema in Karachi‚Äîand donated movie equipment to his school. He also appeared in a 1969 movie, Salgira, as a child artist. Zardari's academic background remains a question mark. He received his primary education from Karachi Grammar School. His official biography says he graduated from Cadet College, Petaro in 1972. He went to St Patrick's High School, Karachi from 1973 to 1974; a school clerk says he failed his final examination there. In March 2008, he claimed he had graduated from the London School of Business Studies with a bachelor of education degree in the early 1970s. Zardari's official biography states he also attended Pedinton School in Britain. His British education, however, has not been confirmed, and a search did not turn up any Pedinton School in London. The issue of his diploma was contentious because a 2002 rule required candidates for Parliament to hold a college degree, but the rule was overturned by Pakistan's Supreme Court in April 2008. Career =Early political career and Benazir Bhutto era= Zardari's initial political career was unsuccessful. In 1983, he lost an election for a district council seat in Nawabshah, a city of Sindh, where his family owned thousands of acres of farmland. He then went into real estate. He married Benazir Bhutto on 18 December 1987. The arranged marriage, done in accordance with Pakistani culture, was initially considered an unlikely match. The lavish sunset ceremony in Karachi was followed by immense night celebrations that included over 100,000 people. The marriage enhanced Bhutto's political position in a country where older unmarried women are frowned upon. Zardari deferred to his wife's wishes by agreeing to stay out of politics. In 1988, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq died in a plane crash. A few months later, Bhutto became Pakistan's first female Prime Minister when her party won 94 of 207 seats contested in the 1988 elections. =Involvement in the first Bhutto Administration and first imprisonment= Zardari, Benazir Bhutto, and baby Bilawal in a state visit to Andrews Air Force Base in 1989 He generally stayed out of his wife's first administration, but he and his associates became entangled in corruption cases linked to the government. He was largely blamed for the collapse of the Bhutto administration. After the dismissal of Bhutto's government in August 1990, Benazir Bhutto and Zardari were prohibited from leaving the country by security forces under the direction of the Pakistan Army. During the interim government between August and October, caretaker Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, a Bhutto rival, initiated investigations of corruption by the Bhutto administration. Jatoi accused Zardari of using his wife's political position to charge a ten percent commission for obtaining permission to set up any project or to receive loans. He was tagged with the nickname \\"Mr. Ten Percent\\". He was arrested on 10 October 1990 on charges relating to kidnapping and extortion. The charges alleged an extortion scheme that involved tying a supposed bomb to a British businessman's leg. The Bhutto family considered the indictment politically motivated and fabricated. In the October 1990 elections, he was elected to the National Assembly while in jail. Bhutto and the PPP staged a walkout from the inaugural session of the National Assembly to protest Zardari's incarceration. He posted $20,000 bail, but his release was blocked by a government ordinance that removed a court's power to release suspects being tried in the terrorist court, which fast-track trials for alleged terrorists. The ordinance was later revoked and a special court acquitted him of bank fraud and conspiracy to murder political opponents. He was freed in February 1993. In March 1994, Zardari was acquitted of bank fraud charges. All other corruption charges relating to Bhutto's first term were dropped or thrown out of the courts. On 25 March 1991, the hijackers aboard Singapore Airlines Flight 117 demanded Zardari's release among other demands. The hijackers were killed by Singapore Commandos. =Political involvement in the second Bhutto Administration= In April 1993, he became one of the 18 cabinet ministers in the caretaker government that succeeded Nawaz Sharif's first abridged premiership. The caretaker government lasted until the July elections. After Bhutto's election, he served as her Investment Minister, chief of the intelligence bureau, and the head of the Federal Investigation Agency. In February 1994, Benazir sent Zardari to meet with Saddam Hussein in Iraq to deliver medicine in exchange for three detained Pakistanis arrested on the ambiguous Kuwait-Iraq border. In April 1994, Zardari denied allegations that he was wielding unregulated influence as a spouse and acting as \\"de-facto Prime Minister\\". In March 1995, he was appointed chairman of the new Environment Protection Council. During the beginning of the second Bhutto Administration, a Bhutto family feud between Benazir and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, surfaced over the political future of Murtaza Bhutto, Nusrat's son and Benazir's younger brother. Benazir thanked Zardari for his support. In September 1996, Murtaza and seven others died in a shootout with police in Karachi, while the city was undergoing a three-year civil war. At Murtaza's funeral, Nusrat accused Benazir and Zardari of being responsible and vowed to pursue prosecution. Ghinwa Bhutto, Murtaza's widow, also accused Zardari of being behind his killing. President Farooq Leghari, who would dismiss the Bhutto government seven weeks after Murtaza's death, also suspected Benazir and Zardari's involvement. Several of Pakistan's leading newspapers alleged that Zardari wanted his brother-in-law out of the way because of Murtaza's activities as head of a breakaway faction of the PPP. In November 1996, Bhutto's government was dismissed by Leghari primarily because of corruption and Murtaza's death. Zardari was arrested in Lahore while attempting to flee the country to Dubai. Jail and exile =The New York Times report= A major report was published in January 1998 by The New York Times detailing Zardari's vast corruption and misuse of public funds. The report discussed $200 million in kickbacks to Zardari and a Pakistani partner for a $4 billion contract with French military contractor Dassault Aviation, in a deal that fell apart only when the Bhutto government was dismissed. It contained details of two payments of $5 million each by a gold bullion dealer in return for a monopoly on gold imports. It had information from Pakistani investigators that the Bhutto family had allegedly accrued more than $1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity. It also reported Zardari's mid-1990s spending spree, which included hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on jewellery. The arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western property companies, Western lawyers, and a network of Western friends. The report described how Zardari had arranged secret contracts, painstaking negotiations, and the dismissal of anyone who objected to his dealings. Citibank, already under fire for its private-banking practices, got into further trouble as a result of the report. Zardari's financial history was one case study in a 1999 U.S. Senate report on vulnerabilities in banking procedures. =Second imprisonment and conviction= In March 1997, Zardari was elected to the Senate while in a Karachi jail. In December 1997, he was flown to Islamabad under tight security to take his oath. In July 1998, he was indicted for corruption in Pakistan after the Swiss government handed over documents to Pakistani authorities relating to money laundering. The Swiss had also indicted him for money laundering. At the same time, in a separate case, he and 18 others were indicted for conspiracy to murder Murtaza Bhutto. After criminal prosecutions began, Citibank closed Zardari's account. In April 1999, Bhutto and Zardari were convicted for receiving indemnities from a Swiss goods inspection company that was hired to end corruption in the collection of customs duties. The couple received a fine of $8.6 million. Both were also sentenced to five years imprisonment, but Bhutto could not be extradited back to Pakistan from her self-imposed exile. Zardari was already in jail awaiting trial on separate charges. The evidence used against them had been gathered by Swiss investigators and the Pakistani Bureau of Accountability. In May 1999, he was hospitalised after an alleged attempted suicide. He claimed it was a murder attempt by the police. In August 2003, a Swiss judge convicted Bhutto and Zardari of money laundering and sentenced them to six months imprisonment and a fine of $50,000. In addition, they were required to return $11 million to the Pakistani government. The conviction involved charges relating to kickbacks from two Swiss firms in exchange for customs fraud. In France, Poland, and Switzerland, the couple faced additional allegations. In November 2004, he was released on bail by court order. A month later, he was unexpectedly arrested for failing to show up for a hearing on a murder case in Islamabad. He was placed under house arrest in Karachi. A day later, he was released on $5,000 bail. His release, rearrest, and then release again was regarded as a sign of growing reconciliation between Musharraf's government and the PPP. After his second release in late 2004, he left for exile in Dubai. =Exile and legal problems= He returned to Lahore in April 2005. Police prevented him from holding rallies by escorting him from the airport to his home. He criticised Musharraf's government, but rumours of reconciliation between Musharraf and the PPP grew. Zardari went back to Dubai in May 2005. In June 2005, he suffered a heart attack and was treated in the United Arab Emirates. A PPP spokesman stated he underwent angioplasty in the United States. In September 2005, he did not show up for a Rawalpindi hearing on corruption charges; the court issued an arrest warrant. His lawyers stated he could not come because he was recovering from his treatment. Following a request by the Rawalpindi court, Interpol issued a red notice in January 2006 against the couple which called on member nations to decide on the couple's extradition. When Bhutto announced in September 2007 her upcoming return to Pakistan, her husband was in New York City undergoing medical treatment. After the October 2007 bombing in Karachi that tainted Bhutto's return, he accused Pakistani intelligence services of being behind the attacks and claimed \\"it was not done by militants\\". He had not accompanied Bhutto, staying in Dubai with their daughters. Bhutto called for the removal of the chief investigator of the attacks because she claimed he had been involved in Zardari's alleged torture in prison in 1999. In November 2007, Musharraf instituted emergency rule for six weeks (see Pakistani state of emergency, 2007), under the pretext of rising Islamist militancy, a few days after Bhutto's departure for Dubai to meet with Zardari. Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal‚Äîthe National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)‚Äîto drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law. Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters. In the midst of his exile, Zardari had several different legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the National Reconciliation Ordinance, drafted in October 2007. However, the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary. In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999. This left open the possibility of investigations into his alleged involvement in about $2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil-for-food program. If the ordinance was rescinded, he would have had to deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer. In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007. In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen $60 million to him through offshore companies because of the National Reconciliation Ordinance. In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil-for-food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms. In Britain, he was fighting a civil case against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion. He successfully used his medical diagnosis to postpone a verdict on his British manor trial. In exile, he shifted between homes in New York, London, and Dubai, where his three children lived. On the night of 27 December 2007, he returned to Pakistan following his wife's assassination. Co-chairperson of the PPP =Bhutto's assassination and succession= Zardari prevented Bhutto's autopsy in accordance with Islamic principles. He and their children attended her funeral, which was held the next day. He denied government allegations that the assassination was sponsored by Al-Qaida. He called for an international inquiry into her death and stated that she would still be alive if Musharraf's government had provided adequate protection. He and his family offered to accept Musharraf's demand to exhume Bhutto's body in exchange for a United Nations inquiry, but Musharraf rejected the proposal. In Bhutto's political will, she had designated Zardari her successor as party leader. However, their nineteen-year-old son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, became Chairman of the PPP because Zardari favoured Bilawal to represent Bhutto's legacy, in part to avoid division within the party due to his own unpopularity. He did, however, serve as Co-Chairman of the PPP for at least three years until Bilawal completed his studies overseas. =February parliamentary elections and coalition formation= Zardari called for no delays to the 8 January parliamentary elections and for the participation of all opposition parties. Other major political parties quickly agreed to participate, ending any chance of a boycott. Because of the turmoil after the Bhutto assassination, the elections were postponed six weeks to 18 February. In January 2008, he suggested that if his party did win a majority, it might form a coalition with Musharraf's Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q). He and Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) party (PML-N), threatened national protests if any vote-rigging was attempted. He himself could not run for Parliament because he had not filed election papers in November 2008, back when he had no foreseeable political ambition while Bhutto was alive. The PPP and the PML-N won the largest and second largest number of seats respectively in the February elections. He and Sharif agreed to form a coalition government, ending American hopes of a power-sharing deal between him and Musharraf. They agreed to restore the judiciary, but Zardari took a less stringent stance than Sharif. He met with U.S. ambassador Anne W. Patterson, who pushed for a pact with Musharraf. To strengthen the new coalition, he reached out to Awami National Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, and Baloch nationalist leaders, who had all boycotted the elections. After weeks of speculation and party infighting, he said he did not want to become Prime Minister. In mid-March 2008, he chose Yousaf Raza Gillani for Prime Minister in a snub to the more politically powerful Makhdoom Amin Fahim. =Coalition government= He and Sharif agreed in a 9 March 2008 agreement, known as the Murree Declaration, to the reinstatement by 30 April 2008 of 60 judges previously sacked by Musharraf. The deadline was later extended to 12 May. He and Sharif held unsuccessful talks at London in May. After the coalition failed to restore the judiciary, the PML-N withdrew from the government in mid-May, pulling its ministers out of the cabinet. The coalition regrouped, again with the PML-N, and proposed a constitutional amendment that would remove the power of the President to dismiss Parliament. By late May, the coalition was set in a confrontation with Musharraf. At the same time, the government was successful in getting Pakistan readmitted to the Commonwealth. He and Sharif met in Lahore in June 2008 to discuss Musharraf's removal and the constitutional amendments, which the PML-N viewed as not going far enough to fulfill the Murree declaration. He opposed impeachment calls because he claimed the coalition did not have the two-thirds majority in both legislative bodies‚ÄîNational Assembly and Senate. He was unwilling to restore the judiciary as divisions in the coalition grew and popular sentiment shifted towards Sharif. The coalition criticised the government for barring Sharif from competing in the June by-elections. Because of the impasses over Musharraf and the judiciary, the coalition could not address rising food shortages and spiraling inflation, which was the highest in 30 years. In August 2008, Zardari relented, and the coalition agreed to proceed full speed towards Musharraf's impeachment by drafting a charge-sheet against him. The coalition charged him with high treason for the 1999 coup and the imposition of martial law. He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and the coalition selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. On 18 August, Musharraf resigned in order to avoid impeachment. Although Zardari favoured granting Musharraf immunity from prosecution, the coalition could not agree on a decision. The coalition also could not reach a united stance on the future of the judiciary. =Rise to presidency= Presidential elections were held within three weeks after the departure of Musharraf. Zardari vowed to pursue an unpopular campaign against tribal militancy in Pakistan and had the support of the United States. He claimed he had a London business school degree to satisfy a prerequisite for the presidency, but his party did not produce a certificate. He was endorsed by the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) for the presidency. The PML-N nominated former justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddiqui, while the PML-Q put forth Mushahid Hussain Sayed. Zardari won a majority in the Electoral College with 481 of 702 votes.The Electoral College is composed of the Senate, the National Assembly, and the four provincial assemblies. The parliamentary lower house National Assembly has 342 seats. The upper house Senate has 100 seats. The four provincial assemblies are Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan respectively. The assemblies have total of 1170 seats, but the number of Electoral College votes is 702 since provincial assembly votes are counted on a proportional basis. A person needs to win 352 votes to obtain a majority. He was elected President on 6 September 2008.The President serves for five years. President of Pakistan =Initial days= Zardari with Emomali Rahmon, Dmitry Medvedev and Hamid Karzai At the inauguration on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai was a guest of honour, which was a signal for much closer cooperation between the two nations in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President. Zardari and Bush meeting in 2008. =United Nations visit= From 23 to 26 September 2008, he met with various foreign leaders, including U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao. He suffered political embarrassment by flirting with U.S. Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin and making tongue-in-cheek comments about her. Although, at the United Nations General Assembly, he publicly condemned U.S drone attacks in Pakistan, The Washington Post reported that he had signed a \\"secret deal\\" when he met with senior American officials that arranged for the coordination of Predator strikes and a jointly approved list of prominent targets. He and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agreed to resume peace talks by the end of 2008. =Economic crises= From 14 to 17 October 2008, he was in China to negotiate foreign aid, as Pakistan faced the possibility of defaulting on its payments. China refused to offer any aid commitments, but instead promised to provide assistance in the development of two nuclear power plants and more future business investments. After Saudi Arabia, Britain, China, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates refused to provide any bailout, he officially asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance in solving Pakistan's balance of payments problem on 22 October. He went to Saudi Arabia from 4 to 6 November in hopes of obtaining financial aid and securing trade agreements. However, leaked cables revealed increasingly strained relations between Zardari and Saudi royalty, primarily because of Saudi distrust of Zardari and preference for Sharif. Weaker cooperation led to decreased oil subsidies as part of a broader Saudi policy of withholding monetary assistance. In mid-November 2008, Zardari's government officially sent a letter of intent to the IMF regarding a bailout to help increase its foreign exchange reserves. In a $11.3 billion multi-year loan package, Pakistan received a $7.4 billion loan for 2008‚Äì10. The IMF stipulated stringent reform conditions, which included rebuilding the tax structure and privatising state enterprises. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank withheld a combined $3 billion aid in the 2010‚Äì11 fiscal year and the IMF withheld since May 2010 the last segment of its aid package. In January 2011, the MQM withdrew from the government. Zardari's ruling coalition averted a government collapse by accepting the opposition's economic proposals, which restored gas subsidies and abandoned many of the IMF's suggested reforms.In Pakistan, a government falls not by losing a majority but after a no- confidence vote. In an effort to curb government expenditures, Zardari swore in an \\"austerity cabinet\\" in February 2011 which reduced the cabinet from 60 ministers to 22. =Foreign policy= Relationship with India In early October 2008, he received fierce domestic criticism for repeatedly calling Kashmiri nationalists (see Kashmir conflict) in India \\"terrorists\\". In mid- November 2008, he suggested Pakistan was ready for a no-first-use nuclear policy and called for closer economic ties. The relationship between the two nations was damaged by the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. He initially denied any links between the perpetrators and Pakistan, but the government soon pursued military action against Lashkar-e-Taiba leaders in a 7 December raid. India cleared Zardari's government of any direct involvement in the attacks, but simultaneously demanded the extradition of 20 Pakistanis which it alleged had taken part in them. Zardari offered to send Inter-Services Intelligence Director-General Ahmed Shuja Pasha to assist in the investigation. In June 2009, Zardari met Singh for the first time since the Mumbai attacks at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Yekaterinburg, Russia. On 8 April 2012, President Zardari, along with his son Bilawal Zardari Bhutto, visited Dargah Sharif in Ajmer, India on a private visit. He also met with the Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.Pakistan Chief Visits India on Low-Profile Trip War in Afghanistan Vice President-Elect Joe Biden meets Zardari in January 2009 The government has had a longstanding conflict in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistani regions bordering Afghanistan. Diplomatic relations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai improved after Musharraf's departure and Zardari's rise to power. The Obama administration's AfPak policy, through AfPak envoy Richard Holbrooke, reflected the unified approach the United States took in dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan. In his first visit to Afghanistan as President in early January 2009, Zardari promised a renewed relationship to improve cooperation. In late March, Obama announced a civilian aid package of $7.5 billion over five years in return for cooperation in the AfPak conflict. In late April, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited Zardari and promised $1 billion over the next four years. In May, Obama held a trilateral summit in Washington D.C with Karzai and Zardari, where they discussed further cooperation. At Brussels in mid-June, Zardari unsuccessfully sought trade concessions from the European Union; it instead pledged $90 million development aid to curtail tribal influence by insurgents. After the U.S. Congress passed Obama's civilian aid package in October, army generals in the Pakistani military establishment widened the growing rift with Zardari's government and openly criticised U.S. interference. Hamid Karzai, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Zardari after the Afghanistan-U.S.-Pakistan trilateral meeting in May 2009 In February 2009, FATA's provincial government officially declared Islamic law in Swat to achieve a ceasefire with the northwestern Pashtun tribes. Because the United States and Britain opposed the measure, Zardari did not sign the Swat ceasefire until mid-April, when domestic pressure from Parliament mounted. By the end of April, the agreement collapsed as the Pakistani military pursued an unpopular offensive in the neighbouring Dir district. In September 2010, Zardari and Karzai met in Islamabad and both advocated fighting insurgents rather than trying to end the war with diplomacy. Zardari went to the United States in January 2011 to attend Special Envoy Holbrooke's funeral. Following Osama bin Laden's death in a compound in Abbottabad in May 2011, Obama called Zardari and collaborated on the events. =Reinstatement of the judiciary= Zardari and Hillary Clinton In February 2009, Zardari and the Musharraf-appointed Supreme Court attempted to disqualify Nawaz Sharif from running in any elections and tried to force his brother Shahbaz Sharif to resign as Chief Minister of Punjab province. Zardari dismissed the Punjab provincial government and only partially reinstated the judiciary by restoring 56 other judges deposed by Musharraf‚Äîbut not their former leader, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. After Nawaz Sharif defied house arrest and rallied with thousands of his supporters, the Sharif brothers vowed to join forces with the Lawyers' Movement in the \\"Long March\\". Zardari's government gave in to popular pressure and Prime Minister Gilani in an early morning speech on 16 March 2009 promised to reinstate Chaudhry by 21 March. Ten judges were reinstated on 16 March, and Chaudry assumed his position on 22 March. Zardari's month-long direct control of the Punjab ended on 30 March. =Nizam-e-Adl Regulation= In April 2009, President Asif Ali Zardari signed the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation into law. The regulation formally established Sharia law in the Malakand division.President signs Nizam-e-Adl Regulation: Presidency . GEO.tv (13 April 2009). Retrieved 12 July 2013. =Reduction of presidential powers= In late November 2009, Zardari ceded to Prime Minister Gillani the chairmanship of the National Command Authority, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal oversight agency. In December 2009, the Supreme Court ruled that the National Reconciliation Ordinance amnesty was unconstitutional, which cleared the way for the revival of corruption cases against Zardari. Although Zardari had immunity from prosecution because he was President, the end of NRO and his earlier corruption cases challenged the legality of his presidency. Calls for his resignation escalated. Zardari, who rarely left the Aiwan-e-Sadr presidential palace, responded with a nationwide spurt of speeches in January 2011. In January 2010, the Supreme Court ordered Pakistan's government to reopen Zardari's corruption charges in Switzerland. However, Zardari prevented the MQM-leaning Attorney General, Anwar Mansoor, from filing charges, so Mansoor resigned in protest in early April. That same month, Zardari won a key victory against the judiciary over his corruption trials when Geneva Attorney General Daniel Zappelli stated that Zardari can not be prosecuted under international laws because of his presidential immunity. Zardari was supported by Prime Minister Gilani, who defied the Supreme Court order. In February 2010, Zardari sparked a standoff by attempting to appoint a Supreme Court candidate without the court's approval, but the confrontation ended after he backed down and nominated a candidate acceptable by the court. In April 2010, after months of political pressure, the government passed the 18th Amendment, which reduced the President to a ceremonial figurehead by stripping the office of the power to dissolve Parliament, to dismiss the Prime Minister, and to appoint military chiefs. The amendment also lifted the restriction of two terms as Prime Minister, which enabled Zardari's foremost political rival, Nawaz Sharif, to seek a third term. The amendment was passed with virtually unanimous support in Parliament and Zardari himself espoused the legislation because of political pressure. After the 18th Amendment, Zardari's main power derived from his position as leader of the PPP, which controls the largest bloc in Parliament. In late September 2010, the Supreme Court considered removing presidential immunity. In October, Chief Justice Chaudry met with his colleagues to discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari's government was planning to fire them; Chaudry requested government assurance that the stories were unfounded. In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes between the President and the judiciary by strengthening the power of the Chief Justice in deciding judicial appointments. In March 2011, Zardari delivered his annual parliamentary address to a half-empty chamber because of an opposition walkout. In November 2012, the Pakistan government in response to the court orders, finally wrote to the Swiss authorities seeking to reopen the corruption cases against Zardari. The Swiss government responded by saying that the corruption cases being time-barred cannot be reopened. =2010 Pakistan floods and Europe tour= The 2010 Pakistan floods began in late July with rain in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and soon submerged a fifth of Pakistan and afflicted 20 million people, resulting in one of the nation's largest natural catastrophes. Simultaneously, British Prime Minister David Cameron sparked a serious diplomatic row with Pakistan during his visit to India by stating that elements within Pakistan were promoting the \\"export of terror\\" a week before a planned visit by Zardari to Britain. Zardari ignored domestic pressure and began his European trip in Paris on 1 August, meeting French President Sarkozy. In France, he drew a rebuke from the U.S. after stating that NATO had \\"lost the battle for hearts and minds\\" in the Afghan war. As the flood's devastation became increasingly evident, he was widely criticised for flying in a helicopter to his Normandy chateau and dining at Cameron's Chequers countryside home. Protests within Britain, mainly among the British Pakistani community, grew against his visit. The widely expected maiden speech by his son Bilawal was cancelled, as Zardari faced criticism for using the trip to advance Bilawal's political aspirations. Zardari returned to Pakistan on 10 August. He first visit to an area affected by the flooding was in Sukkur on 12 August. He cancelled the 14 August Independence Day celebrations and instead visited Naushera. He flew over devastated areas with United Nations Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon on 15 August. He left the country on 18 August and attended the four-way Russian summit at Sochi, which included Tajikistan and Afghanistan. On 19 August, he visited Jampur with U.S. Senator John Kerry. He ordered local authorities to concentrate efforts to save Shahdadkot from inundation on 24 August. =2011 Dubai hospitalisation= In early December 2011 Zardari flew to Dubai undergoing medical tests and treatment, reportedly for a \\"small stroke\\". According to the prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, Zardari sought medical treatment outside of Pakistan because of \\"threats to his life\\". He finds himself currently in the midst of the \\"Memogate\\" controversy. Zardari left the hospital on 14 December to recuperate at the Persian Gulf, while his son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party, assumed a more prominent role in Pakistan. By 19 December, Zardari had returned to Pakistan. = China Pakistan Economic Corridor = Pakistan and China on 22 May 2013 inked several Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) that mainly included the long-term Economic Corridor plan, maritime cooperation and satellite navigation. President Asif Ali Zardari and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang witnessed the signing ceremony as the representatives of the two countries inked the documents at a ceremony held at the Aiwan-e-Sadr. The visit of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang marked the signing of important documents aimed at long-term cooperation between the two countries in multiple areas. Completion of presidential tenure Zardari completed his five-year term on 8 September 2013, becoming the first democratically elected President in the 66-year-long history of Pakistan to complete his tenure. He received a guard of honour while leaving the Aiwan-e- Sadr. He was succeeded by Mamnoon Hussain as President. Post-presidency He became active in the PPP, which he voted to revamp, after his presidency. He succeeded Ameen Faheem as chairman of PPPP in 2015. In December 2016, he announced that both he and his son Bilawal, would contest the 2018 general election. In July 2017, During the investigation of Panama Papers case, Zardari demanded Nawaz Sharif's resignation. In August 2017, Pakistan's anti- corruption acquitted him from his last pending case in which he was accused along with his late wife, Benazir Bhutto, of laundering illegal kickbacks and maintaining assets beyond known sources of income. The case had dogged him for 19 years. His rival Imran Khan believed that Zardari's acquittal was the result of a deal between PML-N and PPP. However he denied any kind of collaboration. The National Accountability Bureau also challenged the acquittal.'Tremendous evidence available': NAB files appeal against Zardari's acquittal in assets case Dawn On 2 September, after his wife's murder case verdict which declared Pervez Musharraf as fugitive and convicted two senior police officer, he said that he was not satisfied with the verdict and that he will appeal the judgment as it had acquitted five Pakistani Taliban suspects.Will appeal against Benazir Bhutto murder case verdict, says Asif Ali Zardari India TV In 2019, he was arrested in Islamabad over a money laundering case. An anti-graft court issued an indictment of Zardari on corruption charges on August 10, 2020. NAB Court Indicts Asif Ali Zardari And Faryal Talpur In Corruption References on 29 September 2020 Personal life =Family= Zardari and Benazir Bhutto had one son and two daughters. His son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, is the current Chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party. His older daughter, Bakhtawar, was born on 25 January 1990, and his younger daughter, Aseefa, was born on 2 February 1993. After Benazir Bhutto's death, his sister Faryal Talpur became the guardian of his children and he changed Bilawal Zardari's name to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. In January 2011, Pakistani news media, including the nation's largest Urdu newspaper (from the Jang Group), reported that Zardari had married Tanveer Zamani. Zardari's spokesperson, Farhatullah Babar, accused Zamani for deliberately aiding to the hoax. In 2015, Zardari‚ÄìZamani marriage was again in the news due recent allegations in the interviews by Tanvir Zamani. Allegedly, they have a son named, Sajawal Bhutto. His mother died in November 2002, during his detention in jail. His father Hakim Ali Zardari died in May 2011. After that he became the chieftain of the Zardari tribe. However, initially he had decided not to assume leadership and wanted to pass the position to his son Bilawal. =Spirituality= Zardari is a Sufi, being a disciple of Prof. Ahmad Rafique Akhtar, who hails from Gujjar Khan and is the guide of many other officials from civil and military circles as well.Staff Report (16 January 2019), \\"Asif Zardari visits spiritual scholar Prof Ahmad Akhter Rafique\\", The Nation. Retrieved 31 March 2020. =Health= His mental health has been a subject of controversy. He has repeatedly claimed he was tortured while in prison. He was diagnosed with dementia, major depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder from 2005 to 2007, which helped influence the verdict of one of his corruption trials. He now claims he is completely healthy, with only high blood pressure and diabetes. Zardari is said to have a belief in the occult and superstitions. According to a report by the Dawn newspaper, \\"a black goat is slaughtered almost daily to ward off the 'evil eye' and protect President Zardari from 'black magic.' \\"It has been an old practice of Zardari to offer Sadaqah (charity) of animal sacrifice and distribute meat to the poor. He has been doing this for a long time,\\" the newspaper quoted the Pakistan president's spokesman Farhatullah Babar as saying.Indian saint beckons Pakistan's 'superstitious' president =Wealth= In 2005, Daily Pakistan reported he was the second richest man in Pakistan with an estimated net worth of $1.8 billion. He amassed great wealth while his wife was Prime Minister. In 2007, he received $60 million in his Swiss bank account through offshore companies under his name. He was reported to have estates in Surrey, West End of London, Normandy, Manhattan (a condominium in Belaire Apartments), and Dubai, as well as a 16th-century chateau in Normandy. In Britain, he used a common legal device‚Äîthe purchase of property through nominees with no family link to the Bhuttos. His homes in Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad are called Bilawal House I, Bilawal House II, and Zardari House respectively. =Surrey estate= He bought a 365-acre (148-hectare) 20-bedroom luxury estate in Rockwood, Surrey in 1995 through a chain of firms, trusts, and offshore companies in 1994. The country home's refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly before the end of his wife's second term. He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption. However, he stepped in to claim that he actually was the beneficial owner. , the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while a civil case continues. The estate includes two farms, lodgings, staff accommodation, and a basement made into an imitation of a local pub. The manor has nine bedrooms and an indoor swimming pool. He had sent large shipments from Karachi in the 1990s for the refurbishment of Surrey Palace. He has faced allegations from various people, including the daughter of Laila Shahzada, that he acquired stolen art to decorate the palace. He earlier had plans for a helipad, a nine-hole golf course, and a polo pony paddock.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court ruling that a prosecutor's use of a peremptory challenge in a criminal case--the dismissal of jurors without stating a valid cause for doing so--may not be used to exclude jurors based solely on their race. The Court ruled that this practice violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case gave rise to the term Batson challenge, an objection to a peremptory challenge based on the standard established by the Supreme Court's decision in this case. Subsequent jurisprudence has resulted in the extension of Batson to civil cases (Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company) and cases where jurors are excluded on the basis of sex (J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.). The principle had been established previously by several state courts, including the California Supreme Court in 1978, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1979 and the Florida Supreme Court in 1984. Background James Kirkland Batson was an African American man convicted of burglary and receipt of stolen goods in a Louisville, Kentucky circuit court by a jury composed entirely of white jurors. The key part of his appeal was based on the jury selection, or voir dire, phase of the trial. During this phase potential jurors are examined by the Court, the prosecution, and the defense, to determine their competence, willingness, and suitability to hear, deliberate and decide a case put to them to render a verdict. During voir dire the judge can dismiss jurors and both the prosecution and the defense have a limited number of peremptory challenges, which are accepted on their face, as the right of the party making the challenge and which they use to excuse any juror for any reason which the particular side believes will help their case. In this case, the judge dismissed several potential jurors for various causes.A juror challenged and removed for cause is not counted as a peremptory challenged against the side making the challenge. The defense peremptorily challenged nine potential jurors and the prosecutor, Joe Gutmann, peremptorily challenged six, including all four black persons, and a jury composed only of white persons was selected. The defense counsel moved to discharge the whole jury on the ground that the prosecutor's removal of the black veniremen violated petitioner's rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a jury drawn from a cross section of the community, and under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws. Without expressly ruling on petitioner's request for a hearing, the trial judge denied the motion, and the jury ultimately convicted the defendant. The defendant appealed his conviction to the Kentucky Supreme Court, which affirmed the conviction. That court cited Swain v. Alabama,Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202 (1965) and held that a defendant alleging lack of a fair cross section must demonstrate systematic exclusion of a group of jurors from the panel of prospective jurors. That is, the defendant had to show that not just in his case, but as a process, juries in his community were being constructed so as to not represent a cross section of that community. Batson continued his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to decide whether petitioner was tried \\"in violation of constitutional provisions guaranteeing the defendant an impartial jury and a jury composed of persons representing a fair cross section of the community.\\" The Supreme Court's decision In a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Lewis Powell, the Supreme Court ruled in Batson's favor. The court overruled Swain v. Alabama by lowering the burden of proof that a defendant must meet to make a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination. In Swain, the Court had recognized that a \\"State's purposeful or deliberate denial to Negroes on account of race of participation as jurors in the administration of justice violates the Equal Protection Clause\\", but that the defendant had the burden of proving a systematic striking of black jurors throughout the county, that is, that the peremptory challenge system as a whole was being perverted. In Batson the court ruled that the defendant could make a prima facie case for purposeful racial discrimination in jury selection by relying on the record only in his own case. The Court explained: The Court also held that: * A State denies a black defendant equal protection when it puts him on trial before a jury from which members of his race have been purposely excluded * A defendant has no right to a petit jury composed in whole or in part of persons of his own race. However, the Equal Protection Clause guarantees the defendant that the State will not exclude members of his race from the jury venire on account of race, or on the false assumption that members of his race as a group are not qualified to serve as jurors * The peremptory challenge occupies an important position in trial procedures Justice Marshall, concurring with the majority, called the decision \\"historic\\" but added: \\"The decision today will not end the racial discrimination that peremptories inject into the jury-selection process. That goal can be accomplished only by eliminating peremptory challenges entirely.\\" =Dissents= In his dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Warren Burger argued that the court's decision in Batson \\"sets aside the peremptory challenge, a procedure which has been part of the common law for many centuries and part of our jury system for nearly 200 years\\". He believed the majority was replacing peremptory challenges with something very similar to challenge for cause, but was unclear in explaining the standard to be applied. \\"I am at a loss to discern the governing principles here,\\" he wrote. \\"I join my colleagues in wishing the nation's judges well as they struggle to grasp how to implement today's holding.\\" Justice Rehnquist wrote that the majority misapplied equal protection doctrine: \\"In my view, there is simply nothing 'unequal' about the state using its peremptory challenges to strike blacks from the jury in cases involving black defendants, so long as such challenges are also used to exclude whites in cases involving white defendants, Hispanics in cases involving Hispanic defendants, Asians in cases involving Asian defendants, and so on.\\" =Impact= Whether the principles of Batson applied retroactively to anyone convicted previously by juries whose racial composition was influenced by peremptory challenges not consistent with this opinion was for a time uncertain. In Allen v. Hardy (1986), the Court held that it did not apply retroactively to collateral review of final convictions. In Griffith v. Kentucky (1987), it decided it would apply it in cases on direct review. Batson challenge The term Batson challenge describes an objection to opposing counsel's use of a peremptory challenge to exclude a juror from the jury pool based on criteria the courts have found disqualifying, as race was the sole rationale for exclusion in Batson. In some cases, parties have appealed a verdict or judgment and asked it be invalidated because one or more peremptory challenges excluded a cognizable group from the jury. Although the Batson decision addressed jury selection in criminal trials, in 1991 the Supreme Court later extended the same rule to civil trials in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company. In 1994, in J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B..,J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., the Court held that peremptory challenges based on sex alone violated the standard established in Batson as well. The authority of Batson was reinforced by a pair of 2005 decisions, Miller-El v. DretkeMiller-El v. Dretke, 545 U.S. 231 and Johnson v. California.Johnson v. California, 545 U.S. 162. The first expanded the evidence that can be considered when establishing that a peremptory challenge was based solely on objectionable criteria. The second addressed the standard of proof by which a Batson challenge should be assessed, finding that it was sufficient to require \\"an inference\\" that discrimination was the basis for a peremptory challenge rather than proof that discrimination was \\"more likely than not\\" its basis. Batson has been applied to the discriminatory use of peremptory strikes against judges in a California case, Superior Court v. Williams. Defense counsel objected to the prosecution's motion to disqualify an African-American judge, suspecting that the motion was racially motivated. The Court noted that use of Equal Protection in Batson to combat racially discriminatory strikes against jurors was well established and that subsequent decisions had extended these protections in other contexts. The Court held that \\"these principles are equally applicable to race-based challenges to judges.\\"Superior Court v. Williams (8 Cal. App. 4th 688) =U.S. v. Blaylock= An attempt to extend Batson to cover challenges based on sexual orientation failed in 2005. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a defendant's criminal appeal in U.S. v. Blaylock,U.S. v. Blaylock, 421 F.3d 758 because it found the prosecution had \\"offered legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for striking the panel member\\". The court did not consider whether the Batson challenge rule applied, but its opinion expressed doubt that it did.United States v. Blaylock, No. 04-1535, August 31, 2005 =SmithKline v. Abbott = Extending Batson to cover challenges based on sexual orientation was revisited again in 2012, this time in a civil case. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered the issue in SmithKline Beecham Corporation v. Abbott Laboratories:SmithKline Beecham Corporation v. Abbott Laboratories, 740 F.3d 471 (2014) it ruled unanimously on January 21, 2014, that, based on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v. Windsor,United States v. Windsor 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013) distinctions based on sexual orientation are subject to the \\"heightened scrutiny\\" standard of review and that \\"equal protection prohibits peremptory strikes based on sexual orientation\\". Defendant Abbott Laboratories decided not to appeal further. However, at least one circuit judge sua sponte called for rehearing en banc, and on March 27 the court asked both parties to file briefs on the question. On June 24, the judges of the Ninth Circuit voted not to rehear the case en banc. Case participants after Batson When the Supreme Court reversed his conviction, Batson was serving a twenty-year sentence. Rather than risk a retrial, he pleaded guilty to burglary and received a five-year prison sentence. After his release, Batson was convicted of several offenses including burglary, theft, receiving stolen property, and persistent-felony convictions. He was released from prison again in January 2003 and remains on parole through 2026. Joe Gutmann, the prosecutor in Batson's 1982 trial, said that the Supreme Court's decision was \\"a good one\\" because it prevents lawyers from discriminating in jury selection. He teaches government and history at inner-city Louisville Central High School. He has said he removed the black members of the venire not because of their race, but because they were young and might sympathize with Batson. Batson is a construction worker in Louisville, Kentucky, and says of the media attention the case received: \\"It's so old, they ought to let it go.\\" See also *Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.

The trail was established by Black Beaver, a Lenape (Delaware) guide and rancher, and his friend Jesse Chisholm, a merchant. They collected and drove numerous cattle along the trail to Kansas, where they could be shipped East to garner high prices. The southern terminus was Red River Station, a trading post near the Red River, along the northern border of Texas. The Northern terminus was a trading post near Kansas City, Kansas. Chisholm owned both these posts. In the years of the cattle drives, cowboys would drive large herds from ranches across Texas to the Red River Station, and then north to Kansas City. Overview Texas ranchers using the Chisholm Trail had their cowboys start cattle drives from either the Rio Grande area or San Antonio. They joined the Chisholm Trail at the Red River of the South, at the border between Texas and Oklahoma Territory. They continued north to the rail head of the Kansas Pacific Railway in Abilene, Kansas, where the cattle would be sold and shipped eastward. The trail is named for Jesse Chisholm, a multiracial trader from Tennessee of half Cherokee descent. Together with scout Black Bear, he developed the trail to transport his goods from one trading post to another. The two men were the first to drive cattle north along this route. Business aspects By 1853, Texas cattle were being driven into Missouri. Local farmers began blocking the herds and turning them back because the Texas Longhorns carried ticks that caused diseases in other types of cattle. Violence, vigilante groups, and cattle rustling caused further problems for the drovers. By 1859, the driving of cattle was outlawed in many Missouri jurisdictions. By the end of the Civil War, most cattle were being moved up the western branch of trail, being gathered at Red River Station in Montague County, Texas. In 1866, cattle in Texas were worth only $4 per head, compared to over $40 per head in the North and East. Lack of market access during the American Civil War had produced an overstock of cattle in Texas. In 1867, Joseph G. McCoy built stockyards in Abilene, Kansas. He encouraged Texas cattlemen to drive their herds to his stockyards. The stockyards shipped 35,000 head that year and became the largest stockyards west of Kansas City, Kansas. That same year, O. W. Wheeler answered McCoy's call, and he along with partners used the Chisholm Trail to bring a herd of 2,400 steers from Texas to Abilene. This herd was the first of an estimated 5,000,000 head of Texas cattle to reach Kansas over the Chisholm Trail. The construction of the Union Pacific Railway through Nebraska eventually offered a cattle drive destination that was an attractive alternative to the Kansas Pacific Railroad. The Texas Trail emerged as an alternative to the Chisholm Trail. Between 1876 and 1884 some drives went along the Texas Trail instead of the Chisholm Trail. Route Chisholm Trail crossing through modern-day Duncan, Oklahoma Chisholm Trail historical marker in Kingfisher, Oklahoma In Texas, hundreds of feeder trails headed north to one of the main cattle trails. In the early 1840s, most cattle were driven up the Shawnee Trail. The Chisholm Trail was previously used by Indian hunting and raiding parties; the trail crossed into Indian Territory (present- day west-central Oklahoma) near Red River Station (in present-day Montague County, Texas) and entered Kansas near Caldwell. Through Oklahoma, the route of US Highway 81 follows the Chisholm Trail through present-day towns of El Reno, Duncan, Chickasha, and Enid.Oklahoma Map of Chisholm Trail Oklahoma State University Digital Library Collections =Northern end of trail= From 1867 to 1871, the trail ended in Abilene, Kansas, but as railroads incrementally built southward, the end of the trail moved to other cities. The end of the trail moved to Newton, Kansas, and soon afterward to Wichita, Kansas. From 1883 to 1887, the end of the trail was Caldwell, Kansas. =Southern start of trail= Historians consider the Chisholm Trail to have started either at Donna, Texas or San Antonio, Texas. In 1931, George W. Saunders, then president of the Old Trail Drivers Association and an authority on Texas livestock history, wrote: \\"The famed Chisholm Trail, about which more has been written than any other Southwestern Trail, cannot be traced in Texas for the reason that it never existed in this State.\\" Pioneer cattlemen knew that they would strike the Chisholm Trail at Red River Station, at the mouth of Salt Creek in Montague County, where they left Texas and crossed into the Indian Territory. Challenges On the long trips‚Äîup to two months‚Äîthe cattlemen faced many difficulties. They had to cross major rivers such as the Arkansas River and the Red River, and innumerable smaller creeks, plus handle the topographic challenges for their herds of canyons, badlands and low mountain ranges. The major drives typically needed to start in the spring after the rains stimulated the growth of green grasses for the grazing cattle. The spring drives, with those rains and higher water levels with the runoff, always meant more danger at the river crossings, which had no bridges. The days of longest sunlight, near mid-June, were also an important consideration in the timing of drives. In addition to natural dangers, the cowboys and drivers encountered rustlers and occasional conflicts with Native Americans. The cattle drives disrupted the hunting and cultivation of crops in Indian Territory. Tribal members demanded that drovers, the trail bosses, pay a toll of 10 cents a head to local tribes for the right to cross Indian lands (Oklahoma at that time was Indian Territory, governed from Fort Smith, Arkansas). The half-wild Texas Longhorn cattle were contrary and prone to stampede with little provocation. The only woman known to run her own cattle drive traveled from Texas to Wichita, Kansas using the Chisholm Trail. Margaret Borland took her family, hired hands, and 2,500 Longhorns through the trail in 1873 in search of profit for her cattle, which was worth triple in Kansas over Texas prices. She died from what was called trail fever just after arriving in Wichita, after an otherwise successful journey . Representation in other media The cattle drives have been a popular topic among Western genre movies. At least 27 movies have portrayed fictional accounts of the first drive along the Chisholm Trail, including The Texans (1938), directed by James P. Hogan and starring Randolph Scott and Joan Bennett; and Red River (1948), directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift. Walter Brennan co-starred in both films. The trail is the subject of at least two pop songs: \\"The Last Cowboy Song,\\" written and recorded by Ed Bruce, also performed by The Highwaymen; and the song \\"The Old Chisholm Trail.\\" Among those who have covered the song are Gene Autry, Girls of the Golden West, Woody Guthrie, Michael Martin Murphey, Tex Ritter, and Roy Rogers. Lead Belly (Huddie Ledbetter) also covered this song, although his version was titled \\"When I Was A Cowboy\\". Legacy In 1964, Texas rancher Charles Schreiner, III, founded the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America. The next year, he conducted a cattle drive from San Antonio to Dodge City with a stop at the LBJ Ranch in Gillespie County, home of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. The drive was promoted as a centennial commemoration of the original Chisholm Trail drives. Many schools in this region have been named after the Chisholm Trail, including: *Chisholm Trail High School in Fort Worth, Texas *Chisholm Trail Middle School in Olathe, Kansas *Chisholm Trail Middle School in Round Rock, Texas *Chisholm Trail Middle School in Rhome, Texas *Chisholm Trail Elementary School in Park City, Kansas *Chisholm Middle School in Newton, Kansas *Chisholm Trail intermediate school in Keller, Texas *Chisholm High School in Enid, Oklahoma *Chisholm Elementary School in Edmond, Oklahoma The Chisholm Trail Heritage Center, located in Duncan, Oklahoma, is an interactive museum dedicated to the history of the trail. It has a large monument depicting a scene from the Chisholm Trail cattle drive, as well as a trail walkway.Chisholm Trail Heritage Center Chisholm Trail art, culture, and history - Duncan, Oklahoma Lockhart, Texas, in Caldwell County, holds a four- day festival on the second weekend of June, to celebrate its place on the Chisholm Trail. Newton, Kansas also holds a three- to four-day Chisholm Trail Festival, combining it with the annual Fourth of July celebration. On September 26, 2009, a historical marker on the Chisholm Trail was unveiled at the site of Red River Station in Montague County. The 5.5-foot concrete marker is the last of 12 erected in Montague County as part of a joint project of the Texas Lakes and Trails and the Montague County Historical Commission to define the Chisholm Trail in this area (as said in Wichita Falls Times Record News). In 2014, the North Texas Tollway Authority constructed a 26-mile-long toll road named after the trail, the Chisholm Trail Parkway. It connects downtown Fort Worth to the nearby city of Cleburne in Johnson County. In 2017, the Texas Historical Commission released The Chisholm Trail: Exploring the Folklore and Legacy, an online tour and mobile app. The tour includes audio tracks and short videos that retell the history of communities and local heritage in towns and cities that line the route of the former Chisholm Trail.

Known for their quirky approach to songwriting, Sparks' music is often accompanied by sophisticated and acerbic lyrics, often about women or Shakespearean literature references, and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified in the contrast between Russell's animated, hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's deadpan scowling. They are also noted for Russell Mael's distinctive wide-ranging voice and Ron Mael's intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style. Early career highlights included \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1974; the disco hit \\"The Number One Song in Heaven\\" in 1979, resulting from a collaboration with Giorgio Moroder and marking a stylistic shift towards new wave/synth-pop; \\"When I'm With You\\", which topped the Australian and French Singles Charts in 1980; the single \\"I Predict\\", which provided Sparks' first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 60 in May 1982; the 1983 single \\"Cool Places\\" with the Go-Go's rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Jane Wiedlin, and \\"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way', which was the top airplay record in Germany for 1994. Their frequently changing styles and visual presentations have kept the band at the forefront of modern, artful pop music. The 2002 release of Lil' Beethoven, their \\"genre-defining opus\\", as well as Hello Young Lovers (2006, their 20th studio album), Exotic Creatures of the Deep (2008), and their fantasy radio musical The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman (2009‚Äì2010) brought Sparks renewed critical and commercial success, and saw them continue to \\"steer clear of pop conventions.\\" In 2015, the band released an album with Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, as the supergroup FFS, titled FFS. In 2017, returning to a rock-group format, Sparks released Hippopotamus, which entered the UK Albums Chart at no. 7, as did their next album, A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip, released in 2020, bringing their tally of UK Top 10 albums to four. Sparks is involved in two upcoming movies, their musical Annette starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard and a documentary about their fifty-year career directed by Edgar Wright. History =Inception= Brothers Ron and Russell Mael grew up in Pacific Palisades, in western Los Angeles County, California, during the \\"Golden Age\\" of the LA club scene, with the Doors, Love and the Standells regularly playing the Whisky a Go Go on Sunset Strip and the Beach Boys playing the afternoon event Teenage Fair. Both Ron and Russell Mael are seen in the audience during the Ronettes' section of the concert film The Big T.N.T. Show, filmed in 1966. Both attended UCLA, Ron studying cinema and graphic art and Russell, theatre arts and filmmaking. Detesting the folk music scene, which they considered \\"cerebral and sedate and we had no time for that\\", they developed a particular taste in English bands of the time such as the Who, Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, the Kinks and the Move, which led to their description of themselves as \\"Anglophiles\\". Their very first recordings were made under the name of \\"Urban Renewal Project\\", on January 14, 1967 at the Fidelity Recording Studios in Hollywood. Four tracks were recorded with married couple Fred and Ronna Frank, who were close friends of the Maels at the time. The songs were pressed on two acetates and have never been released, apart from the track \\"Computer Girl\\", which was featured on a CD included with the Japanese semi-biography from 2006 and more widely released on the Past Tense greatest hits album in 2019. The other three tracks were entitled \\"The Windmill\\", \\"A Quick Thought\\" and \\"As You Like It\\". Of all four songs, \\"Computer Girl\\" was the least traditional. Forming Halfnelson in 1968, they soon came to the attention of producer Todd Rundgren, at whose urging Albert Grossman signed the band to his Bearsville record label. Their eponymous debut album‚Äì with the line-up consisting of college friend Earle Mankey on guitar, Mankey's brother James on bass, Harley Feinstein on drums and Rundgren producing‚Äì sold poorly, but after switching labels to Warner Bros. Records and renaming themselves Sparks, a play on the Marx Brothers, the re-issued debut spawned the minor regional hit \\"Wonder Girl\\". Their follow-up album, A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing, led to a tour of the United Kingdom, including a residency at the Marquee Club in London, These London appearances helped them to secure a significant cult following. =Early 1970s= Adrian Fisher, Norman \\"Dinky\\" Diamond Relocating to England in 1973 with a new manager, John Hewlett, founder of John's Children, and a deal from Island Records, thanks in part to the exposure garnered by their BBC Two Whistle Test performance, they placed an ad in music weekly Melody Maker (\\"Wanted bass player for Sparks. Must be beard free and exciting\\") and through this hired Martin Gordon. With Adrian Fisher on guitar and Norman \\"Dinky\\" Diamond on drums, in the midst of power cuts and a threatened vinyl shortage, they recorded their breakthrough Kimono My House in 1974, scoring a No. 2 hit with the single \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", despite Elton John betting producer Muff Winwood that the song would not break into the charts. Sparks became a UK teen sensation appearing on the cover of Melody Maker, Record Mirror and countless other pop magazines in the UK and Europe. Hits such as \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", \\"Amateur Hour\\" and \\"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\\" led to many appearances on the BBC's flagship music show Top of the Pops. Russell's hyperactive movements were in sharp contrast to the keyboard-bound, soberly dressed Ron's expressionless squint and Charlie Chaplin-esque moustache. Gordon and Fisher were later replaced by Trevor White and Ian Hampton. In 1975, the revised band returned to the US to tour supporting the Kimono and Propaganda albums which had gained strong cult attention in New York City, Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles primarily from FM radio play and a national TV appearance on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. Flo & Eddie were the supporting act. Influential 1970s progressive FM radio station powerhouse WMMS in Cleveland and its famed DJs such as Kid Leo initially championed the band in America. Sparks also performed on American Bandstand in 1975 with host Dick Clark mugging with Ron and on countless other TV shows in the US and abroad post 1977. The follow-up albums, Propaganda and Indiscreet, the latter produced by Tony Visconti, were similarly successful and produced the hit singles \\"Looks, Looks, Looks\\", \\"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\\" and \\"Something for the Girl with Everything\\". =Return home= The Maels returned home to Los Angeles in 1976. Concerned that their music may have become stale, they adopted a more \\"American\\" sound and recorded Big Beat with Rupert Holmes and Jeffrey Lesser on production, which they followed with Introducing Sparks; both albums were mostly recorded with session musicians. This new \\"West Coast\\" sound yielded such songs as \\"Nothing to Do\\", \\"Everybody's Stupid\\", and \\"Throw Her Away (and Get a New One)\\". In 1976, Sparks made one of their first forays into the movie business, making a cameo appearance in the disaster-suspense film Rollercoaster, after Kiss turned down the roles. They performed the songs \\"Fill 'Er Up\\" and \\"Big Boy.\\" By 1977 the brothers found themselves at a crossroads. They had grown tired of recording within a traditional rock band framework and were determined to take their music in a more electronic direction. In a conversation with a German journalist, they expressed their admiration for Giorgio Moroder, a pioneer of electronic disco and pop music. Moroder happened to be a friend of the journalist, and he was able to connect the brothers with the Italian producer, who produced their next album, No. 1 in Heaven. More synthesizer-based than their previous efforts, the album would redefine Sparks' sound and challenge the concept of what is meant by a band, and it also become a major influence on emerging electronic pop artists. It spawned two singles in the top-fifteen UK chart: \\"The Number One Song in Heaven\\" and \\"Beat The Clock\\". The follow-up album in 1980, Terminal Jive, had a hit single in France, \\"When I'm With You\\", which led to the Maels' staying in the country for a year promoting the album, Russell became conversationally fluent in French. The single also hit the Top 20 in Australia, reaching No.14. Finding the electronic equipment that they had adopted for their new sound too cumbersome for touring, the band returned to the more conventional band format for their next three releases, although they did not eschew synthesizers entirely: Whomp That Sucker, Angst in My Pants (two tracks from which appear later in the 1983 movie Valley Girl) and In Outer Space. They finally broke into the US singles chart with \\"Cool Places\\" from 1983's In Outer Space. The track was a collaboration with the Go-Go's rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Jane Wiedlin (who at one time ran her own Sparks fan club), and its success was in part thanks to Los Angeles' KROQ-FM radio station, which hailed them as local heroes. In 1984, the Maels wrote and performed several original songs on the soundtrack for the black comedy teen film Bad Manners (aka: Growing Pains), including the film's title song, \\"Bad Manners\\". In 1988, they scored a hit single in France and in Europe with \\"Singing in the Shower\\", sung in duet with Rita Mitsouko: the single was produced by Tony Visconti. Beginning in the late 1980s, Sparks attempted to make the Japanese manga Mai, the Psychic Girl into a musical, with interest from Tim Burton and Carolco Pictures, who purchased the film rights in August 1991. Carolco hoped Burton would start production in 1992, but he chose to work on The Nightmare Before Christmas and Ed Wood for Touchstone Pictures. The option on the film rights eventually expired, and Burton dropped out. Francis Ford Coppola later developed the property in the late 1990s. In June 2000, Sony Pictures Entertainment started on a different project with Kirk Wong attached to direct. By February 2001, a script had been written by Lisa Addario and Joey Syracuse for Sony's Columbia Pictures. The release of The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman, a radio musical by Sparks, in August 2009, was informed by the six years the band spent trying to get their Mai, the Psychic Girl produced. The album generated new interest, and gained a \\"second wind\\", vocalist Russell Mael explained. \\"The music is all ready and we are hoping that this still might see the light of day.\\" On May 18, 2010, Burton expressed renewed interest in adapting the property. =1990s ‚Äì A new beginning= In 1993, Ron and Russell returned with the single \\"National Crime Awareness Week,\\" their first release since the 1988 album Interior Design. The song was produced by the Scottish dance band Finitribe. In 1994, the Maels released Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins, providing the hit singles \\"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way' and \\"When I Kiss You (I Hear Charlie Parker Playing)\\". In Germany, \\"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way was the No. 1 airplay song for 1994 as well as being hailed critically for its poignant lyrics and touching melody. The band toured in support of the album with percussionist Christi Haydon playing drums. Haydon also appeared in the videos for \\"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way'\\" and \\"When I Kiss You (I Hear Charlie Parker Playing),\\" which were both directed by Sophie Muller. 1997 saw the release of Plagiarism, an album of cover versions of their own songs featuring collaborations with Faith No More, Erasure and Jimmy Somerville. Half of the album was recorded by Tony Visconti in London with the other half recorded by the brothers in their own purpose-built studio in LA, surrounded by busts of Elvis. In 1998 they recorded the soundtrack for the action film Knock Off, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, directed by the acclaimed Hong Kong-based producer/director Tsui Hark (who had appeared on his own tribute song by the band on the album Gratuitous Sax and Senseless Violins). Balls, released in 2000, again put the band in a context of electronic instrumentation with some of Ron's most striking and perceptive lyrics. With the release of Balls the band toured the UK, Germany, Japan and Australia. =2000s= After Balls, the band resurfaced in 2002 with the release of an album described as their \\"genre-defining opus\\" ‚Äì Lil' Beethoven, featuring quasi-classical arrangements of strings and choirs. Lil' Beethoven led to renewed interest in the band. Record Collector magazine named the album as one of its \\"Best New Albums of 2002\\", describing it as \\"...possibly the most exciting and interesting release ever from such a long established act\\" and later in 2003 saying \\"...it really does feel like one of the best albums ever made.\\" A UK and European tour had the band playing the entire album each night in the first half of the show, with fan favourites making up the second. The line-up now included former Faith No More guitarist Dean Menta in addition to Tammy Glover on drums. Long-time fan Morrissey invited Sparks to perform at the 2004 Meltdown Festival, of which he was curator. They performed their breakthrough Kimono My House album, followed by Lil Beethoven, both in their entirety. Also in this period, the duo appeared in the music video for the Darkness' Justin Hawkins's cover of \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", in which Ron and Russell play the referee and MC at a darts match between Hawkins and darts champion Phil Taylor. This version of \\"This Town\\" reached No.6 in the UK charts. Sparks would later release Lil' Beethoven's closing track Suburban Homeboy as a single. February 2006 saw the release of Hello Young Lovers, their twentieth studio album. The album is regarded as carrying on where Lil' Beethoven left off, being described as \\"...cynical, intelligent and very, very funny\\", it has met with considerable acclaim. Sparks lead off the album with the striking tune that the BBC deemed too provocative in its title to play, \\"Dick Around.\\" The song is a multi-section, multi-mood, highly layered track that many felt should have been a UK smash hit had the BBC not misinterpreted the title of the song as being other than it was. The brothers tend to be dismissive of the latest trends in popular music, seeing most current bands as lacking musical ambition and experimental drive. Indeed, the predictable trends in much of modern rock, as they see it, served as inspiration for their latest album. However, they have expressed admiration for Eminem and Morrissey. The pair appeared in the season 6 finale of the US TV show Gilmore Girls, performing \\"Perfume\\" from the album Hello Young Lovers. They released a live DVD of a September 2006 show at The Forum as well as a long-awaited CD release of their previously unavailable 1977 album Introducing Sparks. The track \\"Perfume\\" was featured in a Dolce & Gabbana TV commercial in 2009. On May 12, 2008, Sparks released the single \\"Good Morning\\", taken from the album Exotic Creatures of the Deep. May and June 2008 saw the 21-night \\"Sparks Spectacular\\" in London, where they played each of their albums in chronological order during the first twenty nights, and premiered their new album on the twenty-first concert on June 13, 2008. Each night, they performed an album in its entirety followed by a rare track‚Äì many of the songs had never been performed live before. The band asked their fans to visit their website and vote for the track that they'd most like to hear the band perform during the second half of the 21st concert after the premiere of Exotic Creatures of the Deep, though Russell admitted that he and Ron would probably influence the poll a little. Fans who bought a \\"Golden Ticket\\" (which allowed entry into all 21 gigs) also received a poster signed by the band and a CD single entitled \\"Islington N1\\", a reference to the postal address of the venue for the first 20 gigs. The song \\"Islington N1\\" was later made available in the box set edition of their \\"New Music For Amnesiacs\\" career spanning box set. In 2009 the band played two consecutive nights at The Forum on 20 and 21 March. They played Exotic Creatures of the Deep in its entirety at both gigs, followed by Kimono My House in its entirety on the first night and No.1 in Heaven in its entirety on the second night. Valentine's Day evening 2009 saw Sparks perform the same show featuring their Exotic Creatures of the Deep and Kimono My House albums played in their entirety before a sold-out hometown crowd at Royce Hall at the Mael Bros. alma mater in Los Angeles, UCLA. Ron and Russell appeared as interview subjects in the 2009 documentary The Magnificent Tati, discussing their involvement during the early 1980s in Confusion, a proposed Jacques Tati movie for which a screenplay was written but never shot (due to Tati's death). =The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman (2009)= On August 14, 2009, the band premiered the radio musical The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman, commissioned by the Swedish public radio (SR) and featuring the Mael brothers themselves and Swedish actors Elin Klinga and Jonas Malmsj√∂, both of whom worked with Bergman in his lifetime. The musical, partly in English, partly in Swedish, tells the story of Bergman's relocation to Hollywood after his breakthrough with Smiles of a Summer Night (1956), and the surreal and discomforting encounter with the movie capital. On October 28, 2009, the UK's BBC Radio 6 Music held a similar event in London whereby the musical was played in its entirety before a live audience at the BBC Broadcasting House in London and later to be broadcast with a Q&A; with the Maels. In interviews for Swedish newspapers, the band said they hoped to be able to theatrically stage the musical as well as turn the musical into a feature film. Amongst the filmmakers cited as undertaking The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman with the Mael Brothers is Canadian avant-garde director Guy Maddin. On June 25, 2011 as part of the Los Angeles Film Festival, Sparks presented the World Premiere live performance of The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman. Canadian film director Guy Maddin provided directions based on the screenplay, with Ron and Russell reprising their recorded roles on stage. The role of Ingmar Bergman was performed by Finnish movie actor Peter Franz√©n and American actress Ann Magnuson portrayed the role of Greta Garbo. The show was held at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood. The group showcased at the film festival in their quest for funding for the feature film version. The performance garnered glowing reviews from journals such as The Huffington Post, the LA Times, the LA Weekly, and LA Record. Since 2011, the band have been pursuing the idea of turning The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman into a feature film. Originally envisaged as a live-action film, in 2017, the Mael Brothers announced they were taking a new direction and developing Bergman as an animated feature film with director Joseph Wallace, who created the music video for their track \\"Edith Piaf (Said It Better Than Me)\\". =2010s= In 2010, Sparks remixed Yoko Ono's song \\"Give Me Something\\". In July they contributed a remix of sorts to singer Katie Melua's single, A Happy Place, calling it Sparks VS. Melua. September 2 marked the debut of the new theme songs that Ron and Russell have composed and recorded for NPR radio's Bookworm show, broadcast in Los Angeles on station KCRW. The two songs mark the first time in 21 years that the Bookworm show has used a new theme song, these being commissioned by show host and Sparks fan Michael Silverblatt. The compositions were entitled \\"Where Would We Be Without Books?\\" and \\"I Am A Bookworm\\". For the encore of what may have been the final live date ever in America for Faith No More on December 1 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, Ron and Russell Mael were invited by Mike Patton and Co. to perform the Sparks' classic hit \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us.\\" They reprised the song that also appears as a collaboration with Faith No More on Sparks' 1997 album Plagiarism and had also been released as a single. In 2012 Ron and Russell collaborated with singer Gemma Ray who released a limited 12-inch single titled \\"Gemma Ray Sings Sparks (with Sparks),\\" which included Ray's covers of Sparks' \\"How Do I Get To Carnegie Hall\\" and \\"Eaten by the Monster of Love\\". Though the songs were covers sung by Ray, they were arranged and produced by the Maels. In October, Ron and Russell performed for the first time ever as a duo, with no band. The 18-city European tour titled \\"Two Hands One Mouth\\" began in Lithuania and followed in Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, the UK and Ireland. The final UK concert of the tour was at the sold-out Barbican Centre in London. The tour then took the group to Japan with concerts in Tokyo and Osaka in January 2013. In April 2013, the show was presented for the first time in the US with two performances at the Coachella Festival. A short US tour with shows in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and Philadelphia followed. In May 2013 Ron and Russell played the show in Paris, France, which coincided with their visit to the Cannes Film Festival. In Paris they were joined on stage by Catherine Ringer from Les Rita Mitsouko to sing on their 1989 collaboration \\"Singing in The Shower\\". Sparks first live album, Two Hands, One Mouth: Live in Europe was released in 2013. It contains concert recordings gathered from various cities during the October 2012 European tour. In Fall Ron and Russell continued touring in the duo format for a second round. The tour was titled \\"The Revenge of Two Hands One Mouth.\\" The two-and- a-half-month tour started with shows in the US and Canada. Sparks played in Los Angeles (The Fonda Theatre), New York City (Webster Hall), Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Mountain Oasis Electronic Summit in Asheville, Atlanta, Boston, Washington D.C. (9:30 Club), Toronto, Montreal, Chicago, and Pontiac. The tour then continued to Europe, where they played three nights at Union Chapel in London (where Thurston Moore (ex-Sonic Youth joined them to play guitar on \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\" on one of the nights), as well as additional shows in the UK, Switzerland, France, Spain, and Sweden. Both \\"Two Hands One Mouth\\" and \\"The Revenge of Two Hands One Mouth\\" tours were critically well received. In 2013 they contributed a song and brief voice part to the Guy Maddin movie The Forbidden Room. In February 2014 it was announced the Sparks (Ron and Russell) are working on material with Franz Ferdinand. 2014 marked the 40th Anniversary of Sparks' most popular and most influential album, Kimono My House. They performed the album in its entirety at the Barbican Centre in London on 19 and 20 December. The album was performed with the 35-piece Heritage Orchestra. The show included a second half consisting of songs from Sparks' entire career, that were also orchestrated for the show. The first night sold out within the first few hours. On the second night, they announced that they had completed the recording of their new album. Ron and Russell took the Kimono My House celebrations to Los Angeles as they performed the album on two consecutive nights with a 38-piece orchestra at the United Artists Theatre at Ace Hotel Los Angeles on Valentine's Day 14 February and on 15 February 2015. The orchestra was conducted by Suzie Katayama. Both shows sold out and they received glowing reviews. Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand joined them on stage for duet with Russell on the song \\"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way on both nights and it was then announced that Sparks and FF had joined forces to form a new, then yet-to-be-revealed band and to record an album. In the fall of 2015 the title track from Angst in My Pants was used in a commercial for men's underwear by retailer Tommy John. The ad was titled \\"The Big Adjustment\\" and depicted men, from various walks of life, attempting to secretly adjust their ill-fitting underwear to humorous effect. FFS (2015) On March 9, 2015, it was announced that the band had formed a supergroup with Franz Ferdinand under the name FFS. A short teaser of the FFS song, \\"The Power Couple\\", was released on the group's YouTube channel. The alternative meaning behind the band's name \\"Franz Ferdinand / Sparks\\" was confirmed with a clip of the musicians playing \\"Chinese Whispers.\\" It was also confirmed that the band would be releasing a studio album in 2015 with producer John Congleton and that the band would be touring in the summer. On April 1, it was announced that the group's new album would be titled FFS and that it would be released on June 8 in the UK and on June 9 in the US. They are featured on the Beck album Song Reader doing an ethereal rendition of his song \\"Why Did You Make Me Care.\\" Recently, they performed at the Glastonbury Festival John Peel Stage on 28 June 2015. Hippopotamus (2017) Rough Trade East, Brick Lane, London in September 2017 On March 24, 2017, Sparks performed at the BBC Radio 6 Music Festival in Glasgow, Scotland, prior to the release of a new studio album, Hippopotamus due out in September. The band, consisting of the Mael brothers with 5 other musicians, kicked off their 2017 tour in Copenhagen on August 7. Hippopotamus was both a critical and commercial success, peaking at number 7 in the UK Albums Chart. In 2019, Sparks collaborated with and were featured on French artist Sebastian's album, Thirst on the track, \\"Handcuffed to a Parking Meter\\". In July, the band Sparks announced that they were working on a new album. \\"Please Don't Fuck Up My World\\", the first single, was released in December. =2020s= A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip (2020) In January 2020, Sparks announced the upcoming release of their new album, A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip, comprising 14 songs. A UK and European tour was scheduled for October. The single \\"Self-Effacing\\", was released in February followed by \\"I'm Toast\\" in March. The album had its digital release on May 15, 2020, with the physical release pushed back to July 3, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic; like its predecessor, Hippopotamus, it entered the UK Albums Chart at number 7 and garnered universal critical acclaim. Coinciding with the physical release of the album, an official music video for the song \\"The Existential Threat\\" premiered on YouTube, the animation created by English freelance animator and composer Cyriak Harris. Annette musical, Edgar Wright documentary Sparks is involved in two upcoming film releases, as screenwriters and composers for the musical Annette, directed by Leos Carax and starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard, and in a documentary about their career directed by Edgar Wright. Annette had been scheduled to premiere at the 2020 Cannes Film Festival, which was however cancelled as a result of the pandemic. Style Sparks is generally regarded as an art pop band. Their musical style has varied dramatically with Russell Mael's distinctive wide-ranging voice (in particular his far reaching falsetto) and Ron Mael's intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style being the common thread throughout their fifty-year career. In the beginning they attempted to emulate the sound of their English idols, such as the Who, Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd and the Kinks, sometimes even pretending to be an English band while on the LA club circuit. They relocated to England during the glam rock era where, despite cutting an odd figure on this scene, they found success with their polished brand of intricate pop tunes and convoluted lyrics. Early albums such as Kimono My House combined glam rock with elements of bubblegum pop and baroque music. By the second half of the decade, they were concerned that the sound they had developed while based in England was in danger of becoming stale; they returned to LA, determined to adopt a more \\"West Coast\\" sound. This they achieved with producer Rupert Holmes on Big Beat and (sans Holmes) on Introducing Sparks. The band were not satisfied with the results, which they felt lacked personality, perhaps because of the reliance on session musicians. This led to the most dramatic change of style the band would attempt, when they teamed up with Giorgio Moroder, dropped the rock-group format altogether and produced the disco record No.1 in Heaven which relied on synthesizers. This album is regarded as a landmark in the development of electronic music and greatly influenced bands which would emerge in the following years. They soon returned to a more traditional line-up, which remained until 1988's Interior Design. There then followed a long hiatus until 1994's Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins, which was a foray into the techno dance world, which they had helped to spawn back in the late 1970s. In 2002, the band switched to a classically influenced art pop style with the release of their album Lil' Beethoven, replacing the beat-driven synth-pop of their previous albums with complex orchestral arrangements. The band acknowledged this change in style on the album's opening track \\"The Rhythm Thief\\". Lyrically, the band's style has been described as coming from \\"the school of Cole Porter, favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems,... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre.\\" Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On \\"My Baby's Taking Me Home\\" of Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, \\"Your Call Is Very Important To Us\\", uses a corporation style call-hold message: \\"Your call is very important to us. Please hold\\" which is then sung with some additional words: \\"At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold.\\" The only other lyrics in the song are \\"Red light\\", \\"Green light\\", \\"I'm Getting Mixed Signals\\" and \\"Sorry, I'm Going To Have To Put You Back On Hold\\". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect. The vocal sound on the single \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\" was criticised as being \\"stylised\\". This may be because the song was written without any regard for the vocal style of Russell Mael. Ron Mael has explained: > \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\" was written in A, and by God > it'll be sung in A. I just feel that if you're coming up with most of the > music, then you have an idea where it's going to go. And no singer is gonna > get in my way. Russell Mael has claimed in reply: > When he wrote \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", Ron could only > play it in that key. It was so much work to transpose the song and one of us > had to budge, so I made the adjustment to fit in. My voice ain't a \\"rock\\" > voice. It's not soulful, in the traditional rock way; It's not about \\"guts\\". > It's untrained, unschooled, I never questioned why I was singing high. It > just happened, dictated by the songs. Ron has always written Sparks' lyrics > and never transposed them into a rock key for me to sing. He always packed > each line with words and I had to sing them as they were.The Word, No. 36, > February 2006. Legacy Sparks have influenced many later genres including synth-pop, new wave, post-punk, and alternative music, influencing a wide range of singers and bands including New Order, Depeche Mode, The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, They Might Be Giants, Sonic Youth, ‚ÄúWeird Al‚Äù Yankovic, Nirvana and Bj√∂rk. Peter Hook of New Order cited Giorgio Moroder's production on \\"The Number One Song in Heaven\\" as a major influence when his band changed of musical style to produce electro/dance rock songs like \\"Temptation\\" in 1982. New Order also delivered an extended live version of \\"When I'm With You\\" that same year in Milano.In his autobiography, Peter Hook relates a New Order concert in Milano in 1982 where they did a cover of the 1979 Sparks track, \\"When I'm With You\\". Hook also wrote that New Order's \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Hurt\\" were inspired in part by Giorgio Moroder's \\"production on the wonderful Sparks track \\"Number One Song in Heaven\\".\\" When they started playing music, singer Dave Gahan. Look In. Sacred DM. 5 December 1981. and composer Martin Gore. Look In. Sacred DM. 12 December 1981. of Depeche Mode cited them as one of their favorite bands. Gore also later covered \\"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\\" on his Counterfeit e.p. in 1989. Other early electronic acts like the Human League,Easlea, Daryl (2009). \\"In an interview recently, the Human League cited that record as the thing that got them excited and focused on what they were doing.\\" and Erasure, also mentioned the group. Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran stated about \\"This Town ain't...\\": \\"There was something about them that was very different. I was immediately fascinated with that song.\\"Easlea, Daryl (2009). Sparks were also namechecked by indie pop band the Smiths. Their singer Morrissey named Kimono My House as one of \\"his favourite LPs of all time\\". Smiths' guitarist and composer Johnny Marr said : \\"There‚Äôs nothing better than commerciality crossed with an interesting mind\\" and named \\"This Town Ain‚Äôt Big Enough for the Both of Us\\" as an instance, qualifying it as one of these \\"Trojan singles\\". Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a version of the first Sparks' success as the opening song of their covers album Through the Looking Glass. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth also included the Sparks' song \\"Equator\\" in his list of all-time favorite songs. Joey Ramone also mentioned his liking for their records,Easlea, Daryl (2009). \\"Nothing to do\\", the song that so inspired Joey Ramone, with its Beatles-like buid-up as did later the group They Might Be Giants. According to Kurt Cobain's biographer Christopher Sandford, the Nirvana singer gave \\"specific references\\" when recording their first album Bleach: \\"the guitar part in 'Love Buzz' was lifted from Sparks' Kimono My House\\". Bj√∂rk talked about Kimono my House as one of the records that changed her life. \\"[Sparks] were exotic [...], [they] were the most refreshing thing in my life\\" when she was eight. \\"I loved the way Russell Mael sung like a geisha, and that they were into wearing geisha clothes, as I was really into Japanese people\\". Faith No More also mentioned the group and their performances. Their keyboard player Roddy Bottum said: \\"I saw Sparks play on American Bandstand in 1975. My sister and I went out and immediately bought Indiscreet. In 2004, Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos published an article in the NME titled, \\"why I love the Sparks\\". He said about their music: \\"It's only after a few listens you really can get into it [...] Then you really fall in love and bands change your life. Now I can't imagine life without them\\".\\"Easlea, Daryl (2009). \\"Franz Ferdinand had erupted in early 2004 [...] Alex Kapranos, their lead singer, did a piece in the NME entitled why I love the Sparks. \\"It's only after a few listens you really can get into it [...] Then you really fall in love and bands change your life. Now I can't imagine life without them\\".\\" Sparks were also namechecked by the likes of Def Leppard,Easlea, Daryl (2009). \\"Joe Elliott from Def Leppard who is a huge fan.\\" Ween, Will Sheff of Okkervil River, Mark Burgess of the Chameleons, Cait Brennan, and Justice. In 1980, Paul McCartney also gave a nod to the band in the music video for \\"Coming Up\\" in which he appeared mimicking Ron Mael on keyboards.McCartney related that he liked shooting the clip of \\"Coming Up\\": \\"We got some very sophisticated computer system and I did the guy out of Sparks [Ron Mael], the keyboard played with a Hitler moustache\\". In 2012, British synth-pop duo Spray released the song \\"Sparks Called and They Want Their Ideas Back\\". In June 2018, Edgar Wright announced he is making a documentary on Sparks. He had covered the band's concert in London in May at 02 Forum Kentish Town. This concert will also be a part of the documentary.

A clicker, sometimes called a cricket, is any device that makes a clicking sound, usually when deliberately activated by its user. They usually consist of a piece of thin metal or plastic held in a casing so that the metal is slightly torqued; depressing one end of the metal causes it to pop out of alignment and releasing it causes it to pop back into alignment, each time making a sharp click. With some clickers, the user depresses the metal directly with thumb or finger; with others, a button extends above the surface of the casing so that depressing the button makes the metal click. Use in animal training Clickers were first used by marine mammal trainer Karen Pryor as a way of communicating with their animals. Dolphins and whales communicate underwater through a series of clicks and whistles known as echolocation, and the clicker allowed a trainer to produce signals they were more likely to understand. Nowadays, clickers are used to train all kinds of animals, most commonly dogs. When associated with a treat, a click allows the owner to mark the precise moment the desired behavior is executed. Other uses D-Day cricket issued to Allied paratroopers *In contemporary society, clickers are often used by pet owners (particularly dogs and Gambian pouched rats) as a behavioral tool. *Clickers are used to provide audible feedback for human students learning using a method called TAGteach. *In World War II Clickers were used by Allied paratroopers preceding and during Operation Overlord as a way of covertly identifying friend from foe. A soldier would click once and if two clicks were received in return from an unidentifiable soldier then his identification was confirmed. *Clickers are also used as a handheld counting device, sometimes digital but more commonly mechanical, used to keep a count of the numbers of people entering a venue. It is often used by nightclub doorstaff to make sure fire limits are not exceeded. *A clicker is a device used on recurve bows to signal to the archer that correct draw length has been achieved, thus aiding consistency. *Some board games designed after game shows come with clickers that are meant to emulate the buzzers common on such shows.

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling as Johnny the Bull and World Wrestling Entertainment as Johnny Stamboli. He has also worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, AAA and Lucha Libre USA under the ring name Rellik. Professional wrestling career =World Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2001)= While attending college in Atlanta, Georgia and working as a doorman at the Club Oxygen nightclub, Hugger exercised at the Main Event Fitness gym, which was owned by World Championship Wrestling employees Lex Luger and Sting. During one of his visits to the gym, WCW employee Diamond Dallas Page met with Hugger and encouraged him to train as a wrestler. Hugger subsequently attended the WCW Power Plant training center and took part in a $250 USD tryout alongside 19 other people. The tryout featured press ups, sprinting, squats and freestyle wrestling in temperatures of over 100 degrees. Hugger passed the tryout, but did not immediately begin training as a wrestler. Six months later, he was attacked and stabbed six times. Hugger resolved to change his lifestyle, which he believed had resulted in his assault, and enlisted in the Power Plant. After training for nine months, Hugger debuted on WCW television in late 1999. Hugger adopted the ring name Johnny the Bull and formed a Mafia-themed tag team called The Mamalukes with Big Vito. The duo were managed by Tony Marinara. On January 18, 2000 in Evansville, Indiana, Hugger and Big Vito defeated Crowbar and David Flair for the WCW World Tag Team Championship. The match was broadcast on the January 19 episode of Thunder. They held the championship until February 12, when they were defeated by Creative Control in Oberhausen during a tour of Germany. The Mamalukes regained the championship on the following day in Leipzig, and held it until March 19, when they lost to Creative Control in a no disqualification match at the pay-per-view Uncensored, which took place in the AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami, Florida. On June 5, 2000, The Mamalukes attacked Hardcore Champion Terry Funk during a title defense against WCW President Eric Bischoff, enabling Bischoff to defeat Funk. On the June 7 episode of Thunder, Bischoff awarded the Hardcore Championship to The Mamalukes, making them co- champions. On June 19, Big Vito defeated Hugger to become the undisputed Hardcore Champion. On the July 3 episode of Nitro, while wrestling Funk in a hardcore match, Hugger tore his urethra while executing a diving leg drop and was sidelined for two months while recuperating. On the September 11, 2000 edition of Nitro, Hugger returned to betray Vito and joined several other Power Plant graduates in a stable known as The Natural Born Thrillers, a collection of young wrestlers who sought to challenge more established wrestlers. Although the Thrillers were successful in winning the World Tag Team Championship on several occasions, Hugger reconciled with Vito and reformed the Mamalukes, and the two continued teaming until WCW's closure in March 2001. =World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (2001‚Äì2004)= In March 2001, World Championship Wrestling was purchased by its Stamford, Connecticut-based rival, the World Wrestling Federation. Hugger's contract was bought out by the WWF. Johnny the Bull wrestled one dark match before the July 12, 2001 edition of SmackDown!, losing to Rob Van Dam. Johnny the Bull was introduced to the promotion as a member of The Alliance but after a single appearance on WWF television, Hugger was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association, an Ohio-based WWF developmental territory, in late July 2001, to further his training. While in the HWA, he won the promotion's Heavyweight Championship on two occasions in 2002. After the company was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment in May 2002, Hugger returned to WWE television on the June 30, 2002 episode of Sunday Night Heat under the ring name Johnny \\"The Bull\\" Stamboli, losing via disqualification to Tommy Dreamer. On the July 15 episode of Raw, Stamboli won the Hardcore Championship, his first title in WWE, from Bradshaw. Bradshaw would, however, regain the title from Hugger later that night. On the July 29 episode of Raw, Stamboli won the Hardcore Title once again after pinning Jeff Hardy, but lost the title a few seconds later to Tommy Dreamer. Following this, he became a mainstay on Heat and would later turn face due to fan reaction in late September 2002. On February 13, 2003, Stamboli was moved to the SmackDown! brand and became a heel again when he allied with Nunzio and Chuck Palumbo to attack Rikishi. Together, the trio became The Full Blooded Italians. The FBI would go on to wrestle throughout 2003 and early 2004 before disbanding on March 22, 2004 when Palumbo was moved to the Raw brand. Stamboli and Nunzio continued to team together until he was released from his WWE contract on November 4. =All Japan Pro Wrestling (2004‚Äì2005)= Following his release from WWE, Hugger began wrestling for the Japanese All Japan Pro Wrestling promotion after his friend Troy Endres, who was portraying a fake Great Muta, retired after tearing both of his anterior cruciate ligaments and nominated Hugger as his replacement. Hugger donned a mask and adopted the character of GREAT MUTA, losing to the real Great Muta at The Unchained World on December 5, 2004 in the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo. On January 2, 2005 in the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Hugger dropped his Great Muta character and formed a stable with Taru known as the Voodoo Murders. The Voodoo Murders, who declared that they wished to destroy AJPW, eventually expanded to include several other WCW and WWE alumni, including Chuck Palumbo. =Independent circuit (2005‚Äì2007)= In 2005, Hugger and Chuck Palumbo reformed the Full Blooded Italians in the Italy-based Nu-Wrestling Evolution promotion. In 2006, Hugger toured Mexico, teaming with Marco Corleone in the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre promotion. In late 2006, Hugger began working for the Arizona-based Impact Zone Wrestling promotion, where he created a character named REDRUM, a reference to the 1980 film The Shining. Hugger based Redrum on the Great Muta character he had portrayed in AJPW. In the summer of 2007, Hugger wrestled two dark matches for World Wrestling Entertainment, using the ring name The Unknown Wrestler. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007‚Äì2008)= In late 2007, Hugger exhibited his REDRUM character for Jeff Jarrett, Vince Russo and Terry Taylor, members of the creative team of the Orlando, Florida-based Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion, and was subsequently hired. He debuted in TNA on November 11, 2007 at the pay-per-view Genesis. In his next appearance, his ring name was changed to Rellik, which is Killer spelled backwards. He then aligned himself with Black Reign and James Mitchell, with he and Reign forming a tag team. In their debut match as a team, they lost to Abyss and Raven at Turning Point in a Match of 10,000 Tacks. After losing several matches, the team picked up its first and only victory after defeating The Motor City Machineguns on the March 10, 2008 episode of Impact!. On the April 16 episode of Impact!, Rellik, which is Killer spelled backwards, and Black Reign made their final appearance as a team in a losing effort to Team 3D in the first round of the Deuces Wild tournament. After losing three dark matches in mid-May, Hugger left TNA. =Lucha Libre USA (2010‚Äì2011)= Hugger made his debut in Lucha Libre USA on June 6, 2010, Rellik and Misteriosito were defeated by Lujo Esquire and Octagoncito. Rellik took part in a tournament to crown number one contenders for the LLUSA Heavyweight Championship, he was defeated by Charly Malice in the first round of the tournament. Hugger Joined Lizmark, Jr.'s stable Treachery along with Sydistiko. On December 12, 2010, Treachery (Rellik and Sydistiko) defeated Dinastia (El Oriental and Tinieblas, Jr.) in a tag match to advance into the 3-way tag team title match, Rellik helped Lizmark, Jr. to win the LLUSA Heavyweight Championship by blinding Marco Corleone with powder. On January 22, 2011, Rudisimo (El Oriental and Tinieblas, Jr.) defeated Puerto Rican Power (P.R. Flyer and San Juan Kid) and Treachery (Rellik and Sydistiko) in a three-way tag match to become the inaugural Lucha Libre USA Tag Team Champions. On March 19, Marco Corleone and Shane Helms defeated Treachery (Rellik and Sydistiko) in a tag team match, and later on in the main event, Rellik took part in a lucha roulette elimination number one contenders match for the LLUSA Championship, which was won by Charly Malice. =Return to independent circuit (2011-present)= Hugger is currently working in Phoenix based IWF using the Johnny Stamboli gimmick forming a tag team with Tyson Tyler known as G.F.Y He is also wrestling as Redrum, a character very similar to Rellik. Most recently facing Hurricane Helms in May 2014. Personal life In July 2016, Hugger was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. In September 2018, The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant.

Usability has as one of its primary goals to reduce this gap by removing roadblocks and steps that cause extra thinking and actions that distract the user's attention from the task intended, thereby preventing the flow of his or her work, and decreasing the chance of successful completion of the task. Similarly, there is a gulf of evaluation that applies to the gap between an external stimulus and the time a person understands what it means. Both phrases are first mentioned in Donald Norman's 1986 book User Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-computer Interaction.  Example  This can be illustrated through the discussion of a VCR problem. Let us imagine that a user would like to record a television show. They see the solution to this problem as simply pressing the Record button. However, in reality, to record a show on a VCR, several actions must be taken: # Press the record button. # Specify time of recording, usually involving several steps to change the hour and minute settings. # Select channel to record on - either by entering the channel's number or selecting it with up/down buttons. # Save the recording settings, perhaps by pressing an \\"OK\\" or \\"menu\\" or \\"enter\\" button.

The island is long and has since the eighteenth century been bounded to its seaward side by large embankments. There are four main villages: San Pietro in Volta, Porto Secco, Sant' Antonio di Pellestrina and Pellestrina, known for their colourfully-painted houses. The main industries of the island are market gardening, fishing, tourism and lace making. Like that in Chioggia but unlike that in Torcello, the local lace is made with a needle. Attractions on the island included the Lido of Ca' Roman, known for its pine trees and birdlife. In fiction Donna Leon's crime fiction novel A Sea of Troubles (2001) takes place on Pellestrina. The protagonist, Commissario Guido Brunetti of the Venice police, must solve the murders of two clam fishermen off the shore of Pellestrina and encounters great difficulty conducting an investigation when faced with the island's close-knit community, bound together by a code of loyalty and a suspicion of outsiders. Though a native of Venice, which is a short boat ride away, to the islanders he is a foreigner.

He is currently signed to WWE as a producer. In addition to his appearances with WWE, Noble is known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling from 1999 to 2001 as Jamie Howard, Jamie-San and Jamie Knoble and with New Japan Pro Wrestling and Ring of Honor in 2004 and 2005 under his birth name. He is a former WWE Cruiserweight Champion and ROH World Champion. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1995‚Äì1999)= Gibson was trained to wrestle by Dean Malenko and Bill Weaver. He debuted on the independent circuit in 1995. =World Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2001)= In 1999, Gibson joined World Championship Wrestling. After training at the WCW Power Plant, he made his first appearance with the promotion on July 11, 1999 under the ring name \\"Jamie Howard\\", teaming with Jet Jaguar in a loss to CG Afi and Jeremy Lopez in a dark match at Bash at the Beach. He made his televised debut on the September 28, 1999 episode of WCW Saturday Night, defeating Alan Funk. He went on to perform in the promotion's cruiserweight division. In February 2000, Gibson was renamed \\"Jamie-San\\" and reintroduced to WCW television as a member of the East Asian stable The Jung Dragons, with Gibson wearing a mask to conceal the fact that he was Caucasian. The stable was made up of Gibson, Jimmy Yang, Kaz Hayashi and their valet, Leia Meow. Throughout mid-2000, The Jung Dragons feuded with rival stable 3 Count. Gibson made his pay-per-view debut at New Blood Rising on August 13, 2000, with The Jung Dragons losing to 3 Count in a double ladder match. In November 2000, Gibson left The Jung Dragons and formed a tag team with former 3 Count member Evan Karagias. Gibson removed his mask and adopted the ring name \\"Jamie Knoble\\", with he and Karagias performing as \\"Noble and Courageous\\". Noble and Courageous feuded with the remaining members of The Jung Dragons and 3 Count. Gibson continued to wrestle for WCW until the promotion was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001‚Äì2004)= Upon the acquisition of WCW by the World Wrestling Federation (later renamed World Wrestling Entertainment) in March 2001, Gibson was one of the WCW wrestlers to be signed by the WWF. He was assigned to the WWF developmental territory Heartland Wrestling Association for seasoning, where he won the HWA Cruiserweight Championship under the Jamie Knoble name. Knoble debuted on the main WWE roster on the June 6, 2002 episode of SmackDown! by attacking The Hurricane and was joined by Nidia in a trailer park trash gimmick. The spelling of his ring name was tweaked to \\"Jamie Noble\\" a few weeks afterwards. He won the WWE Cruiserweight Championship from Hurricane at King of the Ring and feuded with Tajiri and Billy Kidman. Noble held the title for 147 days, until he lost the title to Billy Kidman at Survivor Series on November 17, 2002. Noble then got an inheritance, making both Nidia and Noble rich. Noble and Nidia both turned face by befriending Torrie Wilson and Billy Gunn. Nidia finally left him after she was \\"blinded\\" by then heel Tajiri's black mist. He became a heel again by doing things he thought Nidia could not see (mainly using her as a human shield) and lied to her about them. During that time he also feuded with Rey Mysterio for the Cruiserweight Championship. The two would face off for the Championship and Noble lost. A Boyfriend vs. Girlfriend Blindfold Match was then scheduled for Noble and Nidia at No Way Out. Noble came out on top after cheating to see where Nidia was. He left WWE on September 15, 2004 when his steroid usage came to light following a staph infection. Gibson was then released from his contract at his request to take some time off. =New Japan Pro Wrestling (2004‚Äì2005)= Upon leaving WWE, Gibson began performing under his birth name. In September 2004, he began wrestling for the Japanese promotion New Japan Pro Wrestling, where he formed a tag team with Daniel Bryan, then called American Dragon. He made his final appearance with NJPW in February 2005. =Ring of Honor (2005)= In February 2005, Gibson began wrestling for Ring of Honor. On August 12, 2005, Gibson defeated CM Punk, Samoa Joe and Christopher Daniels in an elimination four-way match to win the ROH World Championship. He held the championship until September 17, 2005, when he was defeated by Bryan Danielson. Gibson made his final appearance with Ring of Honor in October 2005, rejoining WWE shortly thereafter. =Return to WWE= Various storylines (2005‚Äì2009) Noble made his return to WWE on the December 17, 2005 episode of Velocity and would later frequently team up with fellow cruiserweight Kid Kash; during June 2006, Noble and Kash debuted a gimmick, where they wore dog collars, and barked and bit and had a short face run. The pair quickly turned heel and were soon named \\"The Pitbulls\\". They then entered the hunt for the WWE Tag Team Championship. The Pitbulls was disbanded after Kash was fired from WWE on September 27, 2006. Noble during a WWE event in 2007 In 2007, Noble returned to competing in the cruiserweight division and performing as an enhancement talent against Rey Mysterio and Bobby Lashley. At No Way Out, Noble competed in a cruiserweight Gauntlet Match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. He was eliminated by his former WCW teammate, Jimmy Wang Yang. Noble returned to television on the June 8 episode of SmackDown!, teaming up with Chavo Guerrero and Daivari against Paul London, Brian Kendrick and Wang Yang in a losing effort. On the June 15 episode of SmackDown!, Noble competed in a Fatal Four-Way number one contenders match for the Cruiserweight Championship, which he lost to Jimmy Wang Yang and also involved Shannon Moore and Daivari. In July, Noble was unsuccessful in a triple threat match for the Cruiserweight Championship against then Champion Guerrero and Funaki. Noble then competed in the Cruiserweight Open at The Great American Bash but was pinned by Hornswoggle. Noble would then begin a feud with Hornswoggle that would see him lose in various humiliating fashions, usually by countout. Moore would constantly use his obsession with Hornswoggle to humiliate him as well. After his feud with Hornswoggle ended, Noble began an angle where he was easily defeated in his matches as punishment for being disrespectful to then-SmackDown! general manager, Vickie Guerrero. He was eventually placed in a match with Chuck Palumbo, which was expected to be yet another squash. Noble, however, defeated Palumbo, which began a feud between the two, as well as involving Palumbo's \\"friend\\" Michelle McCool. After his fourth win against Palumbo he came out when Chuck threatened to hurt McCool. Later in a tag team match, Palumbo attacked Noble and McCool, becoming a heel in the process. As a result of the double turn, Noble became a face character once again. ECW event in March 2008 As part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft, Noble was drafted to the Raw brand. Noble was then involved in a storyline where he tried to impress Layla on multiple occasions only to antagonize and be beaten by larger opponents. He started a feud with William Regal over the course of the storyline, with the two trading wins, and Layla, between them. On the September 15, 2008 episode of Raw, the feud escalated following Noble's victory over Paul Burchill. Layla came out and told Noble it was over and she found a man worthy of her in Regal. On the February 3 episode of ECW Noble asked then-ECW General Manager Theodore Long for an ECW contract and lost to The Boogeyman. On the February 23 episode of Raw, Noble suffered a neck injury in a match with Mike Knox, and was taken to a local hospital. His injury meant that the scheduled segment between Chris Jericho and Ricky Steamboat that was meant to take place in the ring, had to take place on the stage instead. It was later confirmed that the injury was not severe. Noble made his return about one month later. During a match with Sheamus on the November 2, 2009 episode of Raw, Noble sustained a severe back injury after landing badly from a fall out of the ring. On November 10, 2009, Noble announced he was retiring from professional wrestling due to the effects of the injury and several other nagging injuries sustained over his career.  Producer and J&J; Security (2009‚Äìpresent)  Upon retiring, Noble began working as a producer. He made occasional appearances on WWE programming and wrestled sporadically at house shows, including a bout with World Heavyweight Champion at the time Daniel Bryan on January 13, 2012. Noble (center) with J&J; Security partner Joey Mercury (right) and Seth Rollins (left) in December 2014 On the September 29, 2014 episode of Raw, Noble and fellow producer Joey Mercury aligned themselves with the villainous stable The Authority. They were later named \\"J&J; Security\\", with Noble and Mercury acting as bodyguards to Authority member Seth Rollins. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Noble, along with Mercury, would wrestle their first televised matches in several years, when they teamed up with Rollins in a 3-on-2 Handicap match against John Cena and Dolph Ziggler in a losing effort. On the February 5, 2015 episode of SmackDown, J&J; Security once again teamed with Rollins, this time in a 3-on-1 handicap match against Daniel Bryan, once again in a losing effort. After weeks of tension between Rollins and The Authority, on the June 8 episode of Raw, J&J; Security stood up to Rollins, leaving him, before defeating Rollins in a 2-on-1 Handicap match following interference from Dean Ambrose. This is Noble's last match to date. However, on the June 22 episode of Raw, after Rollins apologized to The Authority for his behaviour and Brock Lesnar returning and attacking him, J&J; Security and Kane would help Rollins attack Lesnar. Noble would legitimately suffer three broken ribs from Lesnar after being thrown into the barricade during the brawl. On the July 6 episode of \\"Raw\\", Brock Lesnar viciously attacked J&J; Security, whom an afraid Rollins sent to the ramp with Mercury to stop him from getting his hands on Rollins by confronting him near their (J&J; Security's) new Cadillac, which Rollins had just given them as a gift of his appreciation the previous week. Noble was promptly beaten down by Lesnar and locked into a Kimura Lock submission maneuver. Following this, it was announced that both Noble and Mercury will be out of action indefinitely. In 2017, Noble was seen backstage at Great Balls of Fire assisting Raw General Manager Kurt Angle with the rescue of Braun Strowman who had been trapped in an ambulance due to Roman Reigns crashing into it with a truck, following their ambulance match. On the May 28, 2018 episode of Raw, Noble helped Seth Rollins walk after he was attacked by Elias. He has been involved as a security team member, in numerous pull-apart brawls on Raw and SmackDown throughout 2018 and 2020. On the May 29, 2020 episode of SmackDown, Noble was among officials on the scene following a hit-and-run on Elias and found a seemingly inebriated Jeff Hardy, who was then arrested. Personal life Gibson attended Baileysville High School in Baileysville, West Virginia, where he met his future wife, Angela England. The couple have a son, Gage, and a daughter, Paige. He has two half brothers, Cody and Dale. On September 28, 2016, Gibson was stabbed twice outside of his West Virginia home and was hospitalized after an alleged dispute with a driver. On October 5, 2016, it was revealed that he had a collapsed lung from the stabbing. On June 26, 2020, Noble tested positive for COVID-19.https://www.ringsidenews.com/2020/06/26/jamie-noble-confirms- positive-test-for-coronavirus/ Championships and accomplishments *Heartland Wrestling Association **HWA Cruiserweight Championship (1 time) *Independent Professional Wrestling **IPW Light Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI ranked him No. 42 of the top 500 singles wrestlers of the year in the PWI 500 in 2002 *Ring of Honor **ROH World Championship (1 time) *World Wrestling Entertainment **WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1 time) References External links  * 1976 births American male professional wrestlers The Authority (professional wrestling) members Living people Masked wrestlers Professional wrestling managers and valets People from Melbourne, Florida People from Wyoming County, West Virginia Professional wrestlers from West Virginia ","title":"Jamie Noble"},{"id":"993742","text":"Andrew Stewart MBE (30 December 1933 ‚Äì 11 October 1993) was a Scottish singer, entertainer, and songwriter. He presented the BBC TV variety show The White Heather Club throughout the 1960s, and his song \\"Donald Where's Your Troosers?\\" was a hit in both 1960 and 1989. Early life and education Stewart was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1933, the son of a teacher. When he was five years old, the family moved to Perth and then, six years later, to Arbroath. Even in early childhood, he loved imitating people and amazed his parents with impersonations of famous singers and actors. He attended Arbroath High School, where his father taught science. In 1950, at the age of 16, he participated in the Arbroath Abbey Pageant, taking the part of \\"A Knight in Shining Armour\\". Up until this time, he had not thought seriously about a career in entertainment, as he had aspirations of becoming a veterinary surgeon. He then decided to train as an actor at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow, where he studied until 1954. During his first year at the college, he obtained First Prize for Comedy; he also excelled in fencing, particularly at the foil. Career Stewart's patriotic wearing of tartan and his use of stereotypical Scottish humour, throughout the 1960s, echoed the music hall style and songs of fellow Scot Sir Harry Lauder. He had several international hit singles: \\"Come in-Come in\\", \\"Donald Where's Your Troosers?\\", \\"A Scottish Soldier\\" (which reached no. 1 in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, spent 36 weeks in the UK Singles Chart in 1961, charted in South Africa and India, and peaked at No.69 on the USA's Billboard Hot 100) Joel Whitburn's \\"Top Pop Singles 1955-2012\\" \\"Campbeltown Loch\\", \\"The Muckin' O' Geordie's Byre\\", \\"The Road to Dundee\\", \\"The Battle's O'er\\" (No. 1 on the Australian charts in July 1961), \\"Take Me Back\\", \\"Tunes of Glory\\", and \\"Dr. Finlay\\" (1965). He is also remembered for being the compere of The White Heather Club. This was a BBC Scotland television programme that existed as an annual New Year's Eve party (1957‚Äì1968), and also as a weekly early-evening series (1960‚Äì1968). At the height of its popularity, the show had a viewership of 10 million. \\"Donald Where's Your Troosers?\\" was a hit in late 1960 and again when reissued in 1989. Stewart is said to have written the song in 10 minutes as he sat, minus trousers, in the lavatory of a recording studio. It was also featured in the US TV show Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, sung by one of the Terminators, played by Garret Dillahunt. Stewart included an Elvis Presley impersonation halfway through the song. On the strength of this comedy hit, Stewart toured Australia and appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1968, doing impersonations of Dean Martin. His skill with different accents is also evident on \\"The Rumour\\", where the rumour moves across Scotland and into Ireland, with Stewart speaking in a different accent for each place. Stewart's stage shows often included his impersonations of other famous singers, including Tom Jones, Billy Eckstine, Louis Armstrong, Dean Martin, Johnnie Ray, Elvis Presley, Petula Clark and Johnny Cash. His albums, such as Scottish Soldier, The Best of Andy Stewart and Andy Stewart's Scotland, were also popular internationally. In 1973 he recorded a \\"live\\" album in Johannesburg, South Africa, entitled Andy Stewart in South Africa ‚Äì White Heather Concert, which also featured accordionist Jimmy Blue, singers Alexander Morrison and Anna Desti and pianist Mark Simpson. His international appeal was well-illustrated by his appearance before many thousands of people at the World Fair, New York in 1964. From the early 1960s to the mid-1980s, he frequently and successfully toured Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand. He appeared in concert throughout South Africa in 1968, 1971 and 1973. He also performed in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as well as in Singapore and Hong Kong. Coming out of retirement in 1991, he began tours at home and abroad once again. A prolific lyricist, he penned words to many traditional Scottish tunes, e.g. \\"Green Hills of Tyrol\\" (which he called \\"A Scottish Soldier\\"), \\"The Black Bear\\" (\\"Tunes of Glory\\"), and \\"The Battle is Over\\"(\\"The Battle's O'er\\") etc. He wrote his first lyric at the age of 14 (to a tune composed by his father) and called the song \\"My Hameland\\", which in 1969 (21 years later) became the title track of one of his albums. Stewart took part in the 1961 and 1962 Royal Variety Performances and also appeared before the Royal Family at a Christmas party at Windsor Castle. Scotch Corner, a Scottish television series (1972‚Äì1976) featured Andy Stewart and various guest singers and musicians. Some of the artists included in these broadcasts accompanied Stewart on his international White Heather concert tours during the 1970s. Andy's Party was another popular TV series on Grampian Television in the late 1970s. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1975 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. From 1973 onward, recurrent ill-health took its toll on his voice and stage vitality. Frequently hospitalised in the 1970s and 1980s, he underwent several heart and stomach operations, including triple heart bypass surgery in 1976 and again in 1991. Retirement and death In retirement, he moved back to Arbroath. \\"Donald Where's Your Troosers\\" was a surprise hit when reissued in late 1989. Marketed as a novelty song ideal for Christmas parties, it was actively promoted by BBC Radio One DJ Simon Mayo and reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. In response, Stewart provided a jingle for Mayo, \\"Simon, where's your troosers?\\". \\"Donald, Where's Your Troosers?\\", Andy Stewart Discography. Andystewart.info, Retrieved 30 April 2019 Coming out of retirement in 1991, he began touring once again and recorded two CDs on the Scotdisc label. In 1993 a summer season at the Capitol Moat House Hotel in Edinburgh was cut short because of a back injury. A further long season for the following year was planned at the same venue. Shortly before he died in 1993, he gave a small concert at Arbroath High School for the pupils. He was also due to appear in The \\"Pride of the Clyde\\" at Glasgow's Pavilion Theatre and other tours and concerts were planned. A sheltered housing scheme in Arbroath, 'Andy Stewart Court', was named in his memory. Stewart died the day after a performance at a Gala Benefit Concert for Children's Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) at Usher Hall in Edinburgh. Stewart suffered a fatal heart attack at his home. Stewart's funeral took place at St Andrew's Church (Church of Scotland) in Arbroath on Friday 15 October. His family were joined by many stars and friends from the entertainment world. A large crowd gathered outside the church to pay their respects to \\"The Tartan Trooper\\", while a piper played \\"A Scottish Soldier\\" and \\"The Battle's O'er.\\" Awards and family Stewart was awarded an MBE in 1976. He received the Freedom of Angus in 1987. His son Ewan Stewart is an actor, whose film and television credits include Rob Roy, Titanic, Valhalla Rising, Only Fools and Horses and River City. Stewart's grandson Harris Beattie played the title role of Billy Elliot in the eponymous West End production. In 2017 Harris won the prestigious Royal Academy of Dance Gold medal at the Gen√©e International Ballet Competition and currently is a dancer with Northern Ballet based in Leeds. Another grandson, Alistair Beattie, currently tours internationally as a dancer in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake (2018-2020).

As a poet, he was most influenced by the Parnassian poets. Biography Herman Elroy Flecker was born on 5 November 1884 in Lewisham, London, to William Herman Flecker (d. 1941), headmaster of Dean Close School, Cheltenham, and his wife Sarah.Charles Williams: The Third Inkling, Grevel Lindop, Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 380 His much younger brother was the educationalist Henry Lael Oswald Flecker (1896-1958), who became Headmaster of Christ's Hospital. Flecker later chose to use the first name \\"James\\", either because he disliked the name \\"Herman\\" or to avoid confusion with his father. \\"Roy\\", as his family called him, was educated at Dean Close School, then at Uppingham School. He subsequently studied at Trinity College, Oxford, and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. While at Oxford he was greatly influenced by the last flowering of the Aesthetic movement there under John Addington Symonds, and became a close friend of the classicist and art historian John Beazley. From 1910 Flecker worked in the consular service in the Eastern Mediterranean. On a ship to Athens he met Helle Skiadaressi,Walker, Heather. Roses and Rain (2006). Melrose Books. and in 1911 he married her. Flecker died on 3 January 1915, of tuberculosis, in Davos, Switzerland but was buried in Cheltenham. His death at the age of thirty was described at the time as \\"unquestionably the greatest premature loss that English literature has suffered since the death of Keats\\". Works and influence The excerpt from Flecker's verse drama Hassan ... The Golden Journey to Samarkand inscribed on the clock tower of the barracks of the British Army's 22 Special Air Service regiment in Hereford provides an enduring testimony to Flecker's work: The same inscription also appears on the NZSAS monument at Rennie Lines in the Papakura Military Camp in New Zealand, and at the Indian Army's Special Forces Training School in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh, India. A character in the second volume of Anthony Powell's novel sequence, A Dance to the Music of Time, is said to be \\"fond of intoning\\" the lines For lust of knowing what we should not know / We take the Golden Road to Samarkand, without an attribution to Flecker. (This is in fact a misquotation, the original reads \\"...what should not be known\\"). Saki's short story \\"A Defensive Diamond\\" (in Beasts and Super-Beasts, 1914) references \\"The Golden Journey to Samarkand\\". Agatha Christie quotes Flecker several times, especially in her final novel, Postern of Fate (1973). Jorge Luis Borges quotes a quatrain from Flecker's poem \\"To a Poet a Thousand Years Hence\\" in his essay \\"Note on Walt Whitman\\" (available in the collection Other Inquisitions, 1937‚Äì1952): Nevil Shute quotes from Hassan in Marazan (1926), his first published novel, and in the headings of many of the chapters in his 1951 novel Round the Bend. The Pilgrims' Song from Hassan and its setting by Delius play a pivotal role at the beginning of Elizabeth Goudge's novel The Castle on the Hill (1942).Elizabeth Goudge, The Castle on the Hill, Chapters I.i, II.i Diana Rigg quotes an amended stanza (not the original) from Hassan in the 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service as she looks out of the window of Piz Gloria at the sun rising over the Swiss alps: The original in Flecker's play is more romantic, and makes clear that the Caliph is being addressed, not the Almighty: In Flashman at the Charge (1973), author George MacDonald Fraser concludes a final scene with a decasyllable quatrain pastiche in Flecker‚Äôs style. Following many misadventures suffered by the book‚Äôs picaresque hero Harry Flashman, brother-in-arms rebel leader Yakub Beg waxes poetic and evokes the mystique of middle Asia with its concomitant voyage of self-discovery and friendships hard won by reciting: Flecker's poem \\"The Bridge of Fire\\" features in Neil Gaiman's Sandman series, in the volume The Wake, and The Golden Journey to Samarkand is quoted in the volume World's End.

D'Anzi was born in Milan. In 1935 he wrote music and lyrics of \\"O mia bela Madonina\\" (\\"My beautiful little Madonna\\"), a song dedicated to his hometown which soon became very popular and a sort of unofficial city anthem. Between the 1930s and 1950s Giovanni D'Anzi and Alfredo Bracchi formed a very prolific pair of songwriters. They worked for radio, cinema and theater productions. Several of their songs were great hits. Among them \\"Ma le gambe\\", \\"Bambina innamorata\\", \\"Ma l'amore no\\", 'Voglio vivere cos√¨', \\"Ti parler√≤ d'amor\\". His song \\"Malinconia d'amore\\" has been sung by both Luciano Pavarotti and Jos√© Carreras. Most of their songs were in Milanese dialect, and described ironically characters of the past in Milan, for example \\"La gagarella del Biffi Scala\\" (the spoiled daughter of Mr Biffi Scala) and \\"El Tumiami de Luret\\" (the braggart from Loreto) During the 1960s Giovanni D'Anzi retired from the musical scene. He moved to Liguria and took up painting. He died at Santa Margherita Ligure. Milan's local authorities included him in the list of important Milanese people at the Monumental Cemetery in the Civico Mausoleo Palanti. In 1990 to his memory a plaque was hung in Galleria del Corso in Milan, in front of the place where he worked and near by where he lived, the plaque reads \\"once upon a time in this gallery there was a king: Giovanni D'anzi, he wrote magic notes, and the sweetest serenade he sang for Milan : O mia bela Madonina \\" In his memory, since 1995, the Gruppo Editoriale Curci under the auspices of the Comune di Milano and the association \\" Amici della musica e dello spettacolo \\" organizes the annual Award Giovanni D'Anzi, singing event in Milanese dialect.

It passes through the Franco-Belgian coal basin, formerly an important industrial district. The navigable course begins in Landrecies at the junction with the Canal de la Sambre √† l'Oise, which links with the central French waterway network (or did, until navigation was interrupted in 2006 following structural failures). It runs 54 km and 9 locks 38.50m long and 5.20m wide down to the Belgian border at Jeumont. From the border the river is canalised in two distinct section over a distance of 88 km with 17 locks. The Haute-Sambre is 39 km long and includes 10 locks of the same dimensions as in France, down to the industrial town of Charleroi. The rest of the Belgian Sambre was upgraded to European Class IV dimensions (1350-tonne barges) in the immediate post-World War II period.

Barry Barnes (born 27 March 1943) was Professor of Sociology at the University of Exeter. Barnes worked at the 'Science Studies Unit' at the University of Edinburgh with David Bloor from the 1970s through the early 1990s, where they developed the strong programme in the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge. He moved to the sociology department in Exeter in 1992. Barnes is known for his naturalistic approach to science, a view elaborated in his book Scientific Knowledge and Sociological Theory (1974). He advocated a post-Kuhnian approach to scientific knowledge, and suggested that philosophers, historians and other researchers study scientific practice in a variety of fields as cultural traditions whose development could be given causal explanations. In this view conceptual change in normal science is a process unfolding through expert debate and negotiation. This latter perspective was developed in T. S. Kuhn and Social Science (1982).

Clicker training is an animal training method based on a bridging stimulus (the clicker) in operant conditioning. The system uses conditioned reinforcers, which a trainer can deliver more quickly and more precisely than primary reinforcers such as food. The term \\"clicker\\" comes from a small metal cricket noisemaker adapted from a child's toy that the trainer uses to precisely mark the desired behavior. When training a new behavior, the clicker helps the animal to quickly identify the precise behavior that results in the treat. The technique is popular with dog trainers, but can be used for all kinds of domestic and wild animals and small children. Sometimes, instead of a click to mark the desired behavior, other distinctive sounds are made (such as \\"whistle, a click of the tongue, a snap of the fingers, or even a word\\")\\"5 Clicker Training Myths\\", Wag the Dog, accessed July 29, 2014. or visual or other sensory cues (such as a flashlight, hand sign, or vibrating collar),\\"Clicker Training for Deaf Dogs\\", Deaf Dog Education Action Fund, accessed July 29, 2014. especially helpful for deaf animals.Pryor 1999, p. 4. History B. F. Skinner first identified and described the principles of operant conditioning that are used in clicker training.Skinner, B.F. (1951). How to teach animals. Scientific American, 185, 26-29.Skinner, B.F. (1938). The behavior of organisms: An experimental analysis. New York: Appleton- Century-Crofts. Two students of Skinner's, Marian Kruse and Keller Breland, worked with him researching pigeon behavior and training projects during World War II, when pigeons were taught to \\"bowl\\" (push a ball with their beaks).Peterson, G. (2000). The Discovery of Shaping or B.F. Skinner‚Äôs Big Surprise. The Clicker Journal: The Magazine for Animal Trainers, 43, 6-13. They believed that traditional animal training was being needlessly hindered because methods of praise and reward then in use did not inform the animal of success with enough promptness and precision to create the required cognitive connections for speedy learning. They saw the potential for using the operation conditioning method in commercial animal training.Bailey and Gillaspy, Operant Conditioning Goes to the Fair,The Behavior Analyst 2005, pp 143-159. The two later married and in 1947 created Animal Behavior Enterprises (ABE), \\"the first commercial animal training business to intentionally and systematically incorporate the principles of behavior analysis and operant conditioning into animal training.\\" The Brelands coined the term \\"bridging stimulus\\" in the 1940s to refer to the function of a secondary reinforcer such as a whistle or click. ABE continued operations until 1990, with the assistance of Bob Bailey after Keller Breland died in 1965. They report having trained over 15,000 animals and over 150 species during their time in operation. Although the Brelands tried to promote clicker training for dogs in the 1940s and 1950s, the method failed to catch on until the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1992, animal trainers Karen Pryor and Gary Wilkes started giving clicker training seminars to dog owners. In 1998, Alexandra Kurland published \\"Clicker Training For Your Horse.\\"Kurland, Alexandra, \\"Clicker Training for Your Horse\\" (2004 edition, Ringpress Books), . In the 21st century, training books began to appear for other companion animals, such as cats, birds, and rabbits.See \\"Further Reading\\". Method A selection of clickers The first step in clicker training is teaching the animal to associate the clicker sound (or other chosen marker such as a whistle) with a treat. Every time the click sounds, a treat is offered immediately. Next the click is used to signal that a desired behavior has happened. Some approaches are: *capturing: catching the animal in the act of doing something that is desired, for example sitting or lying down. Eventually the animal learns to repeat the behavior for a treat. *shaping: gradually building a new behavior by rewarding each small step toward it. *luring: using the treat like a magnet to get the animal to move toward the desired position. Once the behavior is learned, the final step is to add a cue for the behavior, such as a word or a hand signal. The animal will have learned that a treat is on the way after completing the desired behavior. The basis of effective clicker training is precise timing to deliver the conditioned reinforcer at the same moment as the desired behaviour is offered. The clicker is used as a \\"bridge\\" between the marking of the behaviour and the rewarding with a primary reinforcer such as a treat or a toy.Pryor 1999, p. 29. The behaviour can be elicited by \\"luring\\", where a hand gesture or a treat is used to coax the dog to sit, for example; or by \\"shaping\\", where increasingly closer approximations to the desired behaviour are reinforced; and by \\"capturing\\", where the dog's spontaneous offering of the behaviour is rewarded.Pryor 1999, p. 60‚Äì62. Once a behaviour is learnt and is on cue (command), the clicker and the treats are faded out.  Punishment or aversives  Clicker training teaches wanted behaviors by rewarding them when they happen, and not using punishments, according to dog trainer Jonathan Philip Klein. Clicker training uses almost entirely positive reinforcements. Some clicker trainers use mild corrections such as a \\"non reward marker\\"; an \\"Uhuh\\" or \\"Whoops\\" to let the dog know that the behaviour is not correct, or corrections such as a \\"Time out\\" where attention is removed from the dog. Alexander continues: Some credit trainer Gary Wilkes with introducing clicker training for dogs to the general public, but behavioral psychologist Karen Pryor was the first to spread the idea with her articles, books (including Don't Shoot the Dog) and seminars. Wilkes joined Pryor early on before going solo. Wilkes writes that \\"No method of training is 'all positive.' By scientific definition, the removal of a desired reward is a 'negative punishment.' So, if you ever withhold a treat or use a time-out, by definition, you are a 'negative' trainer who uses 'punishment. where \\"negative\\" indicates that something has been removed and \\"punishment\\" merely indicates there has been a reduction in the behavior (unlike the common use of these terms).

Formal and polite Chinese terms for foreigner include w√†igu√≥r√©n (), w√†ibƒ´n (), gu√≥j√¨ y«íur√©n ) and w√†igu√≥ pengyou ().\\"Culture: Seven Ways to Say 'Foreigner'\\". 17 Mar 2004.

The term usually does not refer to ethnic Han of non-Chinese citizenship or other Asian ethnicities. Etymology The use of the word began in the 1980s, likely as an abbreviation of the term (foreigner) into plus the prefix . As characters and words, l«éo means \\"old; senior; aged\\"; w√†i means \\"out; outside; external; outer\\", and by extension various meanings including \\"appearance; faraway; distant; non-local; foreign; informal; other; unorthodox\\". is a common colloquial prefix of respect (partly out of the value of seniority conferred), its use dating back to some of the earliest Mandarin vernacular records. In Mandarin, the prefix is well-established enough that it is now inseparably fixed in many words, where its original meaning is lost. For example, l«éoshƒ´ \\"teacher\\" is composed of l«éo and shƒ´ \\"teacher\\", and the original word for \\"teacher\\" shƒ´ cannot be used alone. Other examples include l«éotiƒÅny√© \\"(Lord of) Heavens\\", l«éoxiƒÅng \\"fellow townspeople\\", l«éoh«î \\"tiger\\", and even l«éosh«î \\"mouse\\", an animal traditionally despised for its cultural character as well as its significant damages to humans. In its active use, the prefix l«éo is most often added to surnames to show respect in informal registers towards anyone not definitively young. This is often contrasted to another prefix xi«éo \\"small; little; young\\", which, added to surnames, shows closeness and friendly affection in informal registers towards anyone more junior and at least slightly younger than the speaker. Another much less common and rather restricted use is attaching to a descriptor to mark such a person, with a slightly humorous undertone. For example, l«éow√°ng√π \\"a stubborn one\\" is composed from w√°ng√π \\"stubborn\\". The associations of the prefix can be positive, indicating age or experience--such as l«éop√©ngyou ()--or respect, as in the familiar use of l«éo to denote the senior and respected members of families or to address teachers (, l«éoshƒ´). It may also be used in combination with part of a person's name (usually the family name) to refer to that person in a familiar and respectful way (for example a person with the surname Âë®, or Zh≈çu, could be referred to as ËÄÅÂë®, literally \\"Old Zh≈çu\\"). This usage is reserved exclusively for adults, but implies familiarity rather than seniority, and is often attached to specific individuals as a nickname rather than being freely used. However, in certain restricted contexts, it can also carry negative connotations of being old or aged looking (), boring old --as in l«éo g«îd«íng ()--or of years of experience and contempt--as in l«éo d≈çngxi (, lit. \\"old thing\\"). It may be used in the arts or in jokes with the sense of \\"always\\" or \\"very\\": a famous comedy role was named the L«éoniƒÅn (ËÄÅËî´, \\"Constantly Listless\\"). As a pun with l«éoshƒ´ \\"teacher\\", , Tom Hardy was affectionately known in mainland China as L«éoshƒ´ ( s ) partly for his perpetually shiny hair.\\"Ê±§ËÄÅÊπø(ÊòµÁß∞)\\" \\"Ê±§ÂßÜ¬∑ÂìàËø™ (Ë±ÜÁì£)\\" The character has come to be used for specific nationality as well, with l«éo- functioning as a colloquial equivalent for -gu√≥r√©n: l«éomƒõi (), l«éom√≤ (); even l«éozh≈çng () to refer to Chinese () themselves. Informality of the term Laowai is not considered a necessarily offensive term by those who choose to use it, but may become so from context (tone, manner, situation, etc.). Among the Chinese, the term is informal and may be used in a neutral, genial, or even good-humored way;. Varyingly, it is ironically embraced, begrudgingly accepted, openly resented, or not minded at all among the Western expatriate community.Beyond Beyond Well Being. \\"The \\"Laowai\\", Racism and Personal Space in China\\". 16 Jan 1998.

It is set during the Battle of Berlin in World War II, when Nazi Germany is on the verge of defeat, and depicts the final days of Adolf Hitler (portrayed by Bruno Ganz). The cast also stars Alexandra Maria Lara, Corinna Harfouch, Ulrich Matthes, Juliane K√∂hler, Heino Ferch, Christian Berkel, Alexander Held, Matthias Habich, and Thomas Kretschmann. The film is a German-Austrian-Italian co-production. Principal photography took place from September to November 2003, on location in Berlin, Munich, and in Saint Petersburg, Russia. As the film is set in and around the F√ºhrerbunker, Hirschbiegel used eyewitness accounts, survivors' memoirs, and other historical sources during production to reconstruct the look and atmosphere of 1940s Berlin. The screenplay was based on the books Inside Hitler's Bunker by historian Joachim Fest and Until the Final Hour by Hitler's former private secretary Traudl Junge, among other accounts of the period. The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on 14 September 2004. It was controversial with audiences for showing the human side of Hitler and its portrayal of members of the Third Reich. It later received a wide theatrical release in Germany under its production company Constantin Film. The film grossed over $92 million and received favourable reviews from critics, particularly for Ganz's performance as Adolf Hitler and Eichinger's screenplay. Downfall was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Academy Awards. Scenes from the film, such as the one where a furious Hitler learns that the generals failed to obey his orders, spawned a series of Internet memes. Plot In November 1942, at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia, Leader of Nazi Germany Adolf Hitler selects Traudl Junge as his personal secretary. Three years later, the Red Army has pushed Germany's forces back and surrounded Berlin. On Hitler's 56th birthday, the Red Army begins shelling Berlin's city centre. Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler tries to persuade Hitler to leave Berlin, but Hitler refuses. Himmler leaves to negotiate terms with the Western Allies in secret. Later, Himmler's adjutant Hermann Fegelein also attempts to persuade Hitler to flee, but Hitler insists that he will win or die in Berlin. Dr. Ernst-G√ºnther Schenck is ordered to leave Berlin per Operation Clausewitz, though he persuades an SS general to let him stay in Berlin to treat the injured. In the streets, Hitler Youth child soldier Peter Kranz's father approaches his son's unit and tries to persuade him to leave. Peter, who destroyed two enemy tanks and will soon be awarded a medal by Hitler, calls his father a coward and runs away. At a meeting in the F√ºhrerbunker, Hitler forbids the outnumbered 9th Army to retreat, instead ordering SS commander Felix Steiner's units to mount a counter-attack. The generals find the orders impossible and irrational. Above ground, Hitler awards Peter his medal, hailing Peter as braver than his generals. In his office, Hitler talks to Minister of Armaments Albert Speer about his scorched earth policy. Speer is concerned about the destruction of Germany's infrastructure, but Hitler believes the German people left behind are weak and thus deserve death. Meanwhile, Hitler's companion Eva Braun holds a party in the Reich Chancellery. Fegelein tries persuading Eva, his sister-in-law, to leave Berlin with Hitler, but she dismisses him. Artillery fire eventually breaks up the party. On the battlefield, General Helmuth Weidling is informed he will be executed for allegedly ordering a retreat. Weidling comes to the F√ºhrerbunker to clear himself of his charges. His action impresses Hitler, who promotes him to oversee all of Berlin's defences. At another meeting, Hitler learns Steiner did not attack because his unit was too weak. Hitler becomes enraged at what he sees as an act of betrayal and launches into a furious tirade, stating that everyone has failed him and denouncing his generals as cowards and traitors, before finally acknowledging that the war is lost, but that he would rather commit suicide than leave Berlin. Schenck witnesses civilians being executed by German military police as supposed traitors. Hitler receives a message from Luftwaffe chief Hermann G√∂ring, requesting state leadership. Hitler declares G√∂ring a traitor, ordering his dismissal from all posts, arrest and execution. Speer makes a final visit to the F√ºhrerbunker, and admits to Hitler that he has defied his orders to destroy Germany's infrastructure. Hitler, however, does not punish Speer, who decides to leave Berlin. Peter's unit is defeated and he runs back to his parents. Hitler imagines more ways for Germany to turn the tide. At dinner, Hitler learns of Himmler's secret negotiations and orders his execution. He also finds out that Fegelein has deserted his post, having him executed despite Eva's pleas. SS physician Ernst-Robert Grawitz asks Hitler's permission to evacuate for fear of Allied reprisal. Hitler refuses, leading Grawitz to kill himself and his family. The Soviets continue their advance, Berlin's supplies run low, and German morale plummets. Hitler hopes that the 12th Army, led by Walther Wenck, will save Berlin. After midnight, Hitler dictates his last will and testament to Junge, before marrying Eva. The following morning, Hitler learns that the 12th Army is stuck and cannot relieve Berlin. Refusing surrender, Hitler plans his death. He administers poison to his dog Blondi, bids farewell to the bunker staff, and commits suicide with Eva. The two are cremated in the Chancellery garden. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels assumes the Chancellorship. General Hans Krebs fails to negotiate a conditional surrender with Soviet General Vasily Chuikov. Goebbels declares that Germany will not surrender as long as he is alive. Goebbels' wife Magda poisons her six children with cyanide, before committing suicide with Goebbels; Weidling announces unconditional surrender of German forces in Berlin afterwards. Many government and military officials commit suicide after learning of Germany's defeat, including Krebs. Peter discovers his parents were executed. Junge leaves the bunker and tries to flee the city; Peter joins her as she sneaks through a group of Soviet soldiers before the two find a bicycle and leave Berlin. Cast = Officials and civilians = = Wehrmacht = = SS = Additional cast members in smaller roles include Alexander Slastin as Soviet Colonel general Vasily Chuikov, as Inge Dombrowski, as Walter Wagner, Silke Nikowski as Frau Grawitz, Leopold von Buttlar as Sohn Grawitz, as Tellermann, Boris Schwarzmann as Matvey Blanter, Vsevolod Tsurilo as Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky, Vasily Reutov as Weidling's chief of staff Theodor von Dufving. The Goebbels children are portrayed by (Helga), Charlotte Stoiber (Hilda), Gregory Borlein (Helmut), Julia Bauer (Hedda), Laura Borlein (Holde), and Amelie Menges (Heide). Production =Development= Producer and screenwriter Bernd Eichinger wanted to make a film about Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party for 20 years but was, at first, discouraged after its enormity prevented him from doing so. Eichinger was inspired to begin the filmmaking process after reading Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich (2002) by historian Joachim Fest. Eichinger also based the film on the memoirs of Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries, called Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary (2002). When writing the screenplay, he used the books Inside the Third Reich (1969), by Albert Speer, one of the highest-ranking Nazi officials to survive both the war and the Nuremberg trials; Hitler's Last Days: An Eye-Witness Account (1973), by Gerhard Boldt; Das Notlazarett unter der Reichskanzlei: Ein Arzt erlebt Hitlers Ende in Berlin (1995) by Ernst-G√ºnther Schenck; and Soldat: Reflections of a German Soldier, 1936‚Äì1949 (1992) by Siegfried Knappe as references. After completing the script for the film, Eichinger presented it to director Oliver Hirschbiegel. Though he was interested in exploring how the people of Germany \\"could have plumbed such depths\\", as a German, Hirschbiegel hesitated to take it as he \\"reacted to the idea of Nazism as a taboo\\". Hirschbiegel eventually agreed to helm the project. =Casting= Bruno Ganz studied the Hitler and Mannerheim recording for four months to prepare for his role When Bruno Ganz was offered the role of Hitler, he was reluctant to accept the part, and many of his friends advised against accepting it, but he believed that the subject had \\"a fascinating side\\", and ultimately agreed to take the role. Ganz conducted four months of research and studied a recording of Hitler in private conversation with Finnish Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim in order to properly mimic Hitler's conversational voice and Austrian dialect. Ganz came to the conclusion that Hitler had Parkinson's disease, noting his observation of Hitler's shaky body movements present in the newsreel Die Deutsche Wochenschau, and decided to visit a hospital to study patients with the disease. Ganz auditioned in the casting studio with makeup for half an hour and tested his voice for Hirschbiegel who was convinced by his performance. Alexandra Maria Lara was cast as Traudl Junge; she was given Junge's book Until the Final Hour (2002), which she called her \\"personal treasure,\\" to read during filming. Before she was cast, she had seen Andr√© Heller's documentary film Im toten Winkel which impressed her and influenced her perspective on Junge. =Filming and design= Filming took place near the Obvodny Canal in Saint Petersburg in a run-down industrial district to imitate the setting for Berlin Principal photography lasted 12 weeks in the period from September to November 2003, under the working title Sunset. The film is set mostly in and around the F√ºhrerbunker; Hirschbiegel made an effort to accurately reconstruct the look and atmosphere of World War II through eyewitness accounts, survivors' memoirs, and other historical sources. Hirschbiegel filmed in the cities of Berlin, Munich, and Saint Petersburg, Russia, with a run-down industrial district along the Obvodny Canal used to portray the historical setting in Berlin. Hirschbiegel noted the depressing atmosphere surrounding the shoot, finding relief through listening to Johann Sebastian Bach's music. Alexandra Maria Lara also mentioned the depressing and intense atmosphere during filming. To lighten the mood, Lara's colleagues engaged in activities such as football, while Ganz tried to keep a happy mood by retiring during shooting breaks. The film was produced on a ‚Ç¨13.5 million budget. The bunker and Hitler's Wolf's Lair were constructed at Bavaria Studios in Munich by production designer Bernd Lepel. The damaged Reichstag building was depicted through the use of CGI. Hirschbiegel decided to limit the use of CGI, props and sets so as not to make the set design look like that of a theatre production, explaining: Themes According to Eichinger, the film's overlying idea was to make a film about Hitler and wartime Germany that was very close to historical truth, as part of a theme that would allow the German nation to save their own history and \\"experience their own trauma\\". To accomplish this, the film explores Hitler's decisions and motives during his final days through the perspective of the individuals who lived in the F√ºhrerbunker during those times. Eichinger chose not to include mention of the Holocaust because it was not the topic of the film. He also thought it was \\"impossible\\" to show the \\"misery\\" and \\"desperation\\" of the concentration camps cinematically. =Portrayal= During production, Hirschbiegel believed that Hitler would often charm people using his personality, only to manipulate and betray them. Many of the people in the film, including Traudl Junge, are shown to be enthusiastic in interacting with Hitler instead of feeling threatened or anxious by his presence and authority. The production team sought to give Hitler a three-dimensional personality, with Hirschbiegel telling NBC: \\"We know from all accounts that he was a very charming man ‚Äì a man who managed to seduce a whole people into barbarism.\\" He stated that Hitler was \\"like a shell\\", attracting people with self-pity, but inside the shell was only \\"an enormous will for destruction\\". The film explores the suicides and deaths of the Nazi Party as opposed to the people who choose life. Hitler's provision of cyanide pills to those in the bunker and the Goebbels' murder of their children are shown as selfish deeds while people such as Schenck, who choose to help the injured and escape death, are shown as rational and generous. In the DVD commentary, Hirschbiegel said that the events in the film were \\"derived from the accounts, from descriptions of people\\" in the bunker. The film also includes an introduction and closing with the real Junge in an interview from Im toten Winkel, where she admits feeling guilt for \\"not recognizing this monster in time\\". Release Downfall premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 14, 2004. After first failing to find a distributor, the film was eventually released on September 16 in Germany by Constantin Film. It premiered in the U.S. in Manhattan on February 18, 2005, under Newmarket Films. On its broadcast in the UK, Channel 4 marketed it with the strapline: \\"It's a happy ending. He dies.\\" =Box office and awards= Downfall sold nearly half a million tickets in Germany for its opening weekend and attracted 4.5 million viewers in the first three months. The final North American gross was $5,509,040, while $86,671,870 was made with its foreign gross. The film made $93.6 million altogether. In 2005, Downfall was nominated for an Oscar at the 77th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. It won the 2005 BBC Four World Cinema competition. The film was also ranked number 48 in Empire magazine's \\"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\\" in 2010. Reception =Critical response= The review- aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 90% based on 139 reviews from critics, with a weighted average of 7.99/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"Downfall is an illuminating, thoughtful and detailed account of Hitler's last days.\\" On Metacritic, the film was awarded the \\"Must-See\\" badge, holding a weighted average of 82 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Reviews for the film were often very positive, despite debate surrounding the film from critics and audiences upon its release . Ganz's portrayal of Hitler was singled out for praise; David Denby for The New Yorker said that Ganz \\"made the dictator into a plausible human being\\". Addressing other critics like Denby, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert said the film did not provide an adequate portrayal of Hitler's actions, because he felt no film could, and that no response would be sufficient. Ebert said Hitler was, in reality, \\"the focus for a spontaneous uprising by many of the German people, fueled by racism, xenophobia, grandiosity and fear\\". Hermann Graml, history professor and former Luftwaffe helper, praised the film and said that he had not seen a film that was \\"so insistent and tormentingly alive\\". Graml said that Hitler's portrayal was presented correctly by showing Hitler's will \\"to destroy, and his way of denying reality\\". Julia Radke of the German website Future Needs Remembrance praised the film's acting and called it well crafted and a solid Kammerspielfilm, though it could lose viewer interest due to a lack of concentration on the narrative perspective. German author Jens Jessen said that the film \\"could have been stupider\\" and called it a \\"chamber play that could not be staged undramatically\\". Jessen also said that it was not as spectacular as the pre-media coverage could have led one to believe, and it did not arouse the \\"morbid fascination\\" the magazine Der Spiegel was looking for. Hitler biographer Sir Ian Kershaw wrote in The Guardian that the film had enormous emotive power, calling it a triumph and \\"a marvellous historical drama\\". Kershaw also said that he found it hard to imagine anyone would find Hitler to be a sympathetic figure in his final days. Wim Wenders, in a review for the German newspaper Die Zeit, said the film was absent of a strong point of view for Hitler which made him harmless, and compared Downfall to Resident Evil: Apocalypse, stating that in Resident Evil the viewer would know which character was evil. =Controversy= Downfall was the subject of dispute by critics and audiences in Germany before and after its release, with many concerned regarding Hitler's portrayal in the film as a human being with emotions in spite of his actions and ideologies. The portrayal sparked debate in Germany due to publicity from commentators, film magazines, and newspapers, leading the German tabloid Bild to ask the question, \\"Are we allowed to show the monster as a human being?\\". It was criticized for its scenes involving the members of the Nazi party, with author Giles MacDonogh criticizing the portrayals as being sympathetic towards SS officers Wilhelm Mohnke and Ernst-G√ºnther Schenck, the former of whom was accused of murdering a group of British prisoners of war in the Wormhoudt massacre. But at a discussion in London, Hirschbiegel said in response that he did not find the allegations against Schenck convincing. The film was also seen as controversial because it was made by Germans instead of British or American filmmakers. Russian press visited the set, making the producers uneasy and occasionally defensive. Yana Bezhanskay, director of Globus Film, Constantin's Russian partner, raised her voice to Russian journalists and said: \\"This is an antifascist film and nowhere in it do you see Hitler praised.\\" Cristina Nord from Die Tageszeitung criticized the portrayal, and said that though it was important to make films about perpetrators, \\"seeing Hitler cry\\" had not informed her on the last days of the Third Reich. Some have supported the film: Hans-J√ºrgen Syberberg, director of Hitler: A Film from Germany, felt the time was right to \\"paint a realistic portrait\\" of Hitler. Eichinger replied to the response from the film by stating that the \\"terrifying thing\\" about Hitler was that he was human and \\"not an elephant or a monster from Mars\\". Ganz said that he was proud of the film; though he said people had accused him of \\"humanizing\\" Hitler. Legacy =Parodies= The scene in the film that depicts Hitler angry after his orders were not carried out became a viral video after numerous parodies were posted to the Internet. Downfall is well known for its rise in popularity due to Internet parodies called \\"Hitler Rants\\", which use scenes in the film such as where Hitler becomes angry after hearing that Steiner's attack never happened, when Hitler hears Luftwaffe commander Hermann G√∂ring's telegram, where Hitler phones General der Flieger Karl Koller about Berlin's April 20 bombings, when Hitler discovers Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler secretly made a surrender offer to the Western Allies, where Hitler orders Otto G√ºnsche to find SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Hermann Fegelein, and when Hitler discusses a counterattack against advancing Soviet forces with his generals. In the videos the original German audio is retained, but new subtitles are added so that Hitler and his subordinates seem to be reacting to an issue of setback in present-day politics, sports, entertainment, popular culture, or everyday life. In addition, some users combine footage from the film with other sources, dub the German dialogue over computer games and aerial shots from other films and TV series, or edit images of the characters onto pre-existing or animated footage, often for greater comic effect. The characters also gain several traits about their personalities based on their appearances in the film (such as Fegelein being a notorious prankster, Jodl objecting to Hitler's plans, and Krebs having an unhealthy obsession with map-pointing and fish). By 2010, there were thousands of parodies. Various YouTubers make Downfall reaction videos and some have cited their reasons for making them. Hirschbiegel spoke positively about these parodies in a 2010 interview with New York magazine, saying that many of them were funny and a fitting extension of the film's purpose. Nevertheless, Constantin Film asked video sites to remove them. The producers initiated a removal of parody videos from YouTube in 2010. This prompted more posting of parody videos of Hitler complaining that the parodies were being taken down, and a resurgence of the videos on the site. =Home media= The film was released on DVD in 2005 by Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment. Shout! Factory released a collector's edition Blu-ray in March 2018, with a \\"making-of\\" featurette, cast and crew interviews, and audio commentary from director Oliver Hirschbiegel.

In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy.  Career  While at the University of Bath Professor Collins developed the Bath School approach to the sociology of scientific knowledge. In Changing Order: Replication and Induction in Scientific Practice, Collins outlines a general theory of sociology of science. Drawing from the concepts of \\"Language Game\\" and \\"Forms of Life\\", derived from the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, he seeks an explanation for how scientists follow rules and patterns when performing experiments and scientific practice. Collins' perspective is usually called a relativist position, although this is a strong oversimplification. Collins has written for over 30 years on the sociology of gravitational wave physics. His publications in this area include: \\"The Seven Sexes: Study in Sociology of a Phenomenon, or Replication of Experiments in Physics\\" \\"Son of Seven Sexes: The Social Destruction of a Physical Phenomenon\\". He has traced the search for gravitational waves, and has shown how scientific data can be subject to interpretative flexibility, and how social or 'non-scientific' means can be sometimes used to close scientific controversies. In an article in Science as Practice and Culture, Collins and his co-writer Steven Yearley argue that the Actor-network theory (ANT) approach is a step backwards towards the positivist and realist positions held by early theory of science. At the beginning of the two thousands, Collins along with Dr Robert Evans, also of Cardiff University, has published works on what they term the \\"Third Wave of Science Studies\\" and, in particular, the idea of interactional expertise.

Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157 (1986), was a United States Supreme Court decision that dealt with the effective assistance of counsel during a criminal trial. Background Before his trial for murder, the defendant, Whiteside, discussed his planned testimony with his attorney, and said that he had seen \\"something metallic in [the victim's] hand\\", in contradiction to earlier statements that he had not seen a gun in the victim's hand. Whiteside's attorney, Robinson, had warned that he (Robinson) would have an ethical obligation to report perjured testimony to the court. Whiteside, on the stand, admitted that while he believed the victim had a gun, he did not actually see a gun in the victim's hand. Whiteside was convicted, and subsequently applied for a federal writ of habeas corpus, on the grounds that his conviction was tainted under the Sixth Amendment in that his attorney's threat to disclose the perjury had deprived Whiteside of effective assistance of counsel. Supreme Court decision The Court ruled unanimously that Whiteside had not been deprived of his Sixth Amendment rights. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Burger, stated that an attorney's duty to his client's cause is \\"limited to legitimate, lawful conduct compatible with the very nature of a trial as a search for truth\\", and that \\"the right to counsel includes no right to have a lawyer who will cooperate with planned perjury\\". Concurrences by Justices Blackmun, Brennan and Stevens stated that Whiteside had failed to show that the attorney's actions had caused prejudice to the defendant's trial required to sustain a claim of \\"ineffective representation\\", as required by the case of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). In a separate concurrence, Justice Brennan said that the Court is deciding only the narrow issue \\"conduct acceptable under the Sixth Amendment\\" (quoting the lower court). \\"Unfortunately, the Court seems unable to resist the temptation of sharing with the legal community its vision of ethical conduct.\\" But it is up to \\"the States... how [lawyers] behave in their courts, unless and until federal rights are violated.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 475 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court Further reading * External links * United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court United States Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance of counsel case law 1986 in United States case law Perjurers ","title":"Nix v.

Dantian are the \\"qi focus flow centers\\", important focal points for meditative and exercise techniques such as qigong, martial arts such as t'ai chi ch'uan, and in traditional Chinese medicine. Overview Historically the first detailed description of the lower Dantian is in the Laozi zhongjing ËÄÅÂ≠ê‰∏≠Á∂ì from the 3rd century CE, it refers to the elixir-of-life field where \\"essence\\" and \\"spirit\\" are stored, it is related to regeneration and sexual energy, menstruation and semen.Laozi zhongjing (Central Scripture of Laozi), sec. 17. Translation published in Fabrizio Pregadio, \\"Early Daoist Meditation and the Origins of Inner Alchemy,\\" in Benjamin Penny, ed., Daoism in History: Essays in Honour of Liu Ts'un-yan, 139‚Äì40 (London: Routledge, 2006). http://www.goldenelixir.com/taoism/texts_laozi_zhongjing.html Traditionally, a dantian is considered to be a center of qi or life force energy. The dantian are important points of reference in neidan, qigong, neigong, tao yin, Taoist sexual practices, reikihttp://www.aetw.org/reiki_ifaq6.htm#9 and other self- cultivation practices of exercise, breathing, and meditation, as well as in martial arts and in traditional Chinese medicine. The lower dantian is particularly important as the focal point of breathing technique as well as the centre of balance and gravity. Dantian are focal points for transmutation of the three treasures jing, qi and shen. Qi can be seen as a substance when it is stored in the form of Essence or jing, this can be refined by heating in these cauldrons into more rarefied states such as qi which is insubstantial and further still into shen which is more like the Western concept of mind although it is more often translated as \\"spirit\\".T'ai Chi Ch'uan and Meditation by Da Liu, page 92 ‚Äì Routledge and Keegan Paul 1987 Taoist and Buddhist teachers often instruct their students to centre the mind in the navel or lower dantian. This is believed to aid control of thoughts and emotions. Acting from the dantian is considered to be related to higher states of awareness or samadhi. The Taoist concept of dantian as energy centers is similar to the Indian yoga concept of chakras as key points where prana is stored (see also nadi). The major difference, however, is that Taoist dantian are the major energetic storage mechanisms whereas the yogic chakras are not so much storage centers, but energetic vortices which act as intake and output ports. Many traditions consider the dantian and the chakras to be separate, albeit cooperative energetic mechanisms. Three dantians Different schools of thought categorize dantian in various manners. Three main dantian are typically emphasized: * Lower dantian (, Xi√† DƒÅnti√°n): below the navel (about three finger widths below and two finger widths behind the navel), which is also called \\"the golden stove\\" (ÈáëÁÇâ pinyin: Jƒ´n l√∫) or the namesake \\"elixir-of- life field\\" proper, where the process of developing the elixir by refining and purifying essence (jing) into vitality (qi) begins. * Middle dantian (, Zh≈çng DƒÅnti√°n): at the level of the heart, which is also called \\"the crimson palace\\", associated with storing spirit (shen) and with respiration and health of the internal organs, in particular the thymus gland. This cauldron is where vitality or qi is refined into shen or spirit.http://www.goldenelixir.com/jindan/dantian.html * Upper dantian (, Sh√†ng DƒÅnti√°n): at the forehead between the eyebrows or third eye, which is also called \\"the muddy pellet\\", associated with the pineal gland. This cauldron is where shen or spirit is refined into wu wei or emptiness. Full text here Importance of the lower dantian The term dantian used by itself usually refers to the lower dantian, which is considered to be the foundation of rooted standing, breathing, and body awareness in qigong, Chinese martial arts, and other martial arts. The lower dantian has been described to be \\"like the root of the tree of life.\\" In speaking of the lower of the three energy centers, the term dantian is often used interchangeably with the Japanese word hara (; Chinese: f√π) which means simply \\"belly.\\" In Chinese, Korean, and Japanese traditions, it is considered the physical center of gravity of the human body and is the seat of one's internal energy (qi). A master of calligraphy, swordsmanship, tea ceremony, martial arts, among other arts, is held in the Japanese tradition to be \\"acting from the hara.\\" The lower dantian corresponds to the yoga concept of the swadhisthana chakra. In yoga philosophy, it is thought to be the seat of prana that radiates outwards to the entire body.T'ai Chi Ch'uan and Meditation by Da Liu, pages 91‚Äì92 ‚Äì Routledge and Keegan Paul 1987 See also * Hara (tanden) * Jing (TCM) * Kiai * Kundalini energy * Meditation * Mindfulness (Buddhism) * Misogi * Pushing hands * Qigong * Secret of the Golden Flower * Silk reeling * T'ai chi ch'uan * Triple burner References * Chia, Mantak.

He was the leading political figure in Paraguay from early- post-war period until the Liberal revolution of 1904. Early life Born in Ybycu√≠, Caballero was a descendant of Spanish nobility, the son of Jose Ram√≥n Caballero de Anazco (a descendant from T√∫pac Huallpa through Inca Garcilaso de la Vega) and his wife Melchora In√©s Melgarejo y Gen√©s. Married twice, to Mar√≠a de la Concepci√≥n D√≠az de Bedoya and to Julia √Ålvarez. From the first marriage he had two children, Ramon Caballero de Bedoya, married to Martha Cahen, and had issue, and Melchora Caballero de Bedoya, married to her distant cousin Carlos Francisco Saguier Pereira. Outside of his marriages he had a further 90 children, all formally recognized by him, and thus today he has myriad descendants. =Military service= Caballero joined the Paraguayan Army in 1864 and fought in the Paraguayan War.Hooker, T.D., 2008, The Paraguayan War, Nottingham: Foundry Books, He participated in the Mato Grosso Campaign. Later he became the assistant of President Francisco Solano L√≥pez in Humait√° and remaining loyal, rose through the ranks. He became an increasingly important leader of rearguard actions, eventually becoming a cavalry general. Caballero was the greatest living war hero, who was captured by Brazilians on April 8, 1870 near the Apa river after the Battle of Cerro Cor√° and released in May 1871.Historical Dictionary of Paraguay During his arrest he became friendly with Brazilians and their political and military support was instrumental later, during his political career. Post-war politics Caballero returned to Asuncion and become involved in the politics, joining the Lopez loyalist faction led by C√°ndido Bareiro. He was one of the leaders of March and June 1873 revolts and January 1874 revolt against the politically powerful Benigno Ferreira who was forced to go into exile in February 1874. Because of his growing influence, Caballero was made Interior minister in the government of Salvador Jovellanos. In November 1874 Caballero was appointed Minister of Justice, Worship and Education under the new President Juan Bautista Gill.Historical Dictionary of Paraguay Together with Vice President Higinio Uriarte he was sent to London in 1874-75 to clarify the situation with financial loans. After the death of Juan Bautista Gill in 1877, he helped to ensure that his political ally C√°ndido Bareiro was elected to the Presidency. The coup of 1880 On September 4, 1880, after the death of C√°ndido Bareiro his Vice President Adolfo Saguier was arrested by the Minister of War and Navy Pedro Duarte. Adolfo Saguier was then asked to sign his resignation. On the same day Senate of Paraguay met and elected Caballero to the Presidency. Thus, after the short presidencies of politically stronger Gill and Bareiro, the leader of 1873-74 rebellions had come to power. =Presidency= During his rule he Civil Register was established, city of Villa Florida founded, General Department of Immigration created. In June 1881 Banco Nacional and private Bance del Paraguay were established. Rebirth of the Paraguayan Republic: The First Colorado Era, 1878-1904 During his presidency much of the land previously owned by state and the ruling Lopez family was sold off in order to raise money. Later political life Caballero rigged the 1886 Presidential election to ensure the victory of his close ally Patricio Escobar. In response, his political opponents founded the Liberal Party and two months later Caballero founded the ruling Colorado Party. From 1887 to 1904 as a former President he was also member of the Senate of Paraguay, and its president in 1894 and 1902.https://www.csj.gov.py/cache/lederes/R-1-011894-L-5-0.pdf Caballero maintained a large degree of control as he remained commander of the army and Colorado Party. His favored candidates controlled the country until 1894, when Juan Bautista Eguzquiza overthrew Juan Gualberto Gonz√°lez. Caballero helped to organize another coup in 1902, putting Juan Antonio Escurra in power, but after Escurra's overthrow by the Argentine Army, the Liberals took power. Caballero is remembered as one of the greatest Paraguayan political leaders and is buried in the National Pantheon of the Heroes.

Rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizens =Rights of citizens= Adult citizens of the United States who are residents of one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) have the right to participate in the political system of the United States, as well as their state and local governments, (with most states having restrictions on voting by persons convicted of felonies, and a federal constitutional prohibition on naturalized persons running for President and Vice President of the United States), to be represented and protected abroad by the United States (through U.S. embassies and consulates), and to live in the United States and certain territories without any immigration requirements. Felons can vote in over 40 states, and in at least 2 while incarcerated. Felons can also serve jury duty if approved. =Responsibilities of citizens= SomeJury selection procedures vary by jurisdiction, and the composition of the jury pool can vary from one jurisdiction to another. U.S. citizens have the obligation to serve in a jury, if selected and legally qualified. Citizens are also required (under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code) to pay taxes on their total income from all sources worldwide, including income earned abroad while living abroad. Under certain circumstances, however, U.S. citizens living and working abroad may be able to reduce or eliminate their U.S. federal income tax via the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion or the Foreign Tax Credit. U.S. taxes payable may be alternatively reduced by credits for foreign income taxes regardless of the length of stay abroad.

Acquisition of citizenship There are various ways a person can acquire United States citizenship, either at birth or later on in life. =Birth within the United States= Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\\"A Colorado birth certificate, which can be used to prove U.S. citizenship.Because Native American tribes within the geographical boundaries of the U.S. held a special sovereignty status, the tribes were not \\"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\" and thus Native Americans who were born into tribes were not considered citizens, even if they left the tribe and settled in white society, which the Supreme Court upheld in Elk v. Wilkins. However, in 1924, Congress granted birthright citizenship to Native Americans through the Indian Citizenship Act. Furthermore, under the Insular Cases, unincorporated U.S. territories and commonwealths are appurtenant to the United States rather than part of the United States, which limits applicability of the U.S. Constitution. Congress has conferred birthright citizenship, through legislation, to persons born in all inhabited territories except American Samoa and Swains Island, who are granted the status of U.S. Nationals. (See .) In the case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court ruled that a person becomes a citizen of the United States at the time of birth, by virtue of the first clause of the 14th Amendment, if at a minimum that person: * Is born in the United States * Has parents that are subjects of a foreign power, but not in any diplomatic or official capacity of that foreign power * Has parents that have permanent domicile and residence in the United States The Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled whether children born in the United States to immigrants illegally present in the country are U.S. citizens from birth, but it is generally presumed they are.; cf. also the opinion in 8 FAM 301.1-1.d: \\"All children born in and subject, at the time of birth, to the jurisdiction of the United States acquire U.S. citizenship at birth even if their parents were in the United States illegally at the time of birth.\\" The constitutional provision reads in pertinent part, \\"All persons born...in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens...\\". Birth certificates from U.S. jurisdictions are therefore proof of citizenship, except where specified otherwise (e.g. in the case of children born to diplomats, who do not fall under United States jurisdiction pursuant to the Vienna Convention, unless one parent is a permanent resident or citizen). = Through birth abroad to United States citizens =  Birth abroad to two United States citizens  A State Department certification of birth abroad, issued prior to 1990.A child is automatically granted citizenship if: #Both parents were U.S. citizens at the time of the child's birth; #The parents are married; and #At least one parent lived in the United States prior to the child's birth.

A person's Consular Report of Birth Abroad issued by a U.S. consulate or embassy is proof of citizenship. They may also apply for a passport or a Certificate of Citizenship as proof of citizenship. Different rules apply for persons born abroad to one U.S. citizen before November 14, 1986. United States law on this subject changed multiple times throughout the twentieth century, and the law is applicable as it existed at the time of the individual's birth.

Eligibility for naturalization To become a naturalized United States citizen, one must be at least eighteen years of age at the time of filing, a legal permanent resident (or non-citizen national) of the United States, and have had a status of a legal permanent resident in the United States for five years before they apply. (This 5-year requirement is reduced to three years if they (a) acquired legal permanent resident status, (b) have been married to and living with a citizen for the past three years and (c) the spouse has been a U.S. citizen for at least three years prior to the applicant applying for naturalization.) They must have been physically present for at least 30 months of 60 months prior to the date of filing their application. Also during those 60 months if the legal permanent resident was outside of the U.S. for a continuous period of 6 months or more they are disqualified from naturalizing (certain exceptions apply for those continuous periods of six months to 1 year). The territory of the United States, for the purposes of determining one's period of residence, includes the fifty states, District Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has been added to this list effective November 28, 2009. Prior to that date, residence in the CNMI normally did not count as residence in the United States for naturalization purposes. American Samoa is not included into the territory of the United States for the purposes of determining one's period of residence (unless the person being naturalized is a US national, rather than a permanent resident alien; see below). A certificate of naturalization. An applicant for citizenship must be a \\"person of good moral character\\", and must pass a test on United States history and government. Most applicants must also have a working knowledge of the English language. There are exceptions, introduced in 1990, for long-resident older applicants and those with mental or physical disabilities. Some exemptions from permanent residency exist for certain qualifying naturalization applicants. For example, an undocumented immigrant who served in the US military during a designated period of hostility may naturalize without having first been a permanent resident. An immigrant who successfully completes the MAVNI program may naturalize in 10 weeks without first having been a permanent resident. Similarly, an immigrant who has made extraordinary contributions can be exempted from residency as well as the physical presence requirement and prohibitions for support of totalitarianism and or communism.INA ¬ß208(b)(2)(A) Before 1906, all municipal courts, county courts, state courts, and federal courts in the U.S. had the authority to grant U.S. citizenship to an individual.\\"Naturalization Records\\". U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. Retrieved June 26, 2019. A non- citizen U.S. national (see below) is also eligible for naturalization after becoming a resident of any state. For such persons (unlike most other applicants for naturalization), time spent in American Samoa counts as time spent in the United States for the purposes of determining residence and physical presence. Citizenship test Questions and answers for the civics portion of the citizenship test The entire citizenship test is in the form of a one-on-one interview. The citizenship test has four components: a speaking/comprehension test, a reading test, a writing test and a civics test. For the civics test, applicants for citizenship are asked ten questions, and must answer at least six with the expected answers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has published a list of 100 sample questions (with the answers that should be given when taking the test), from which the questions asked are always drawn. The full list of questions is in the document \\"A Guide to Naturalization\\", available for free from the USCIS. (USCIS Publication M-476 (rev. 01/09)) The test examines the applicant's knowledge of American society and the English language. Sample questions and answers are published by the USCIS in English, Spanish, and Chinese. Besides passing the citizenship test, citizenship applicants must also satisfy other specific requirements of naturalization to successfully obtain U.S. citizenship. Eligibility for public office A person who becomes a U.S. citizen through naturalization is not considered a natural born citizen. Consequently, naturalized U.S. citizens are not eligible to become President of the United States or Vice President of the United States, which would ordinarily be the case as established by the Presidential Succession Act. For example, though the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor are tenth and eleventh in the presidential line of succession, Elaine Chao and Carlos Gutierrez (respectively former U.S. Secretaries of Labor and Commerce under President George W. Bush) would have been unable to succeed to the presidency because they became U.S. citizens through naturalization. The highest-ranking naturalized citizens to have been excluded from the Presidential Line of Succession were Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright, each of whom would have been fourth in line as Secretary of State had they been natural born citizens. Whether this restriction applies to children born to non-U.S. citizens but adopted as minors by U.S. citizens is a matter of some debate, since the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 is ambiguous as to whether acquisition of citizenship by that route is to be regarded as naturalized or natural-born. Those who argue that the restriction does not apply point out that the child automatically becomes a citizen even though violating every single requirement of eligibility for naturalization, and thus the case falls closer to the situation of birth abroad to U.S. citizens than to naturalization. Some argue that the phrase \\"natural born citizen\\" describes a category of citizenship distinct from that described by the phrase \\"U.S. Citizen\\" in Article Two of the United States Constitution, and this was discussed during the constitutional convention of 1787. While it is true that \\"natural born citizen\\" is not defined anywhere within the text of the Constitution and that the Constitution makes use of the phrase \\"citizen\\" and \\"natural born citizen\\", Supreme Court decisions from United States v. Wong Kim Ark to the present have considered the distinction to be between natural-born and naturalized citizenship. In her 1988 article in the Yale Law Journal, Jill Pryor wrote, \\"It is well settled that 'native-born' citizens, those born in the United States, qualify as natural born. It is also clear that persons born abroad of alien parents, who later become citizens by naturalization, do not. But whether a person born abroad of American parents, or of one American and one alien parent, qualifies as natural born has never been resolved.\\"Jill Pryor, The Natural-Born Citizen Clause and Presidential Eligibility: An Approach for Resolving Two Hundred Years of Uncertainty An April 2000 CRS report by the Congressional Research Service, asserts that most constitutional scholars interpret the phrase \\"natural born citizen\\" as including citizens born outside the United States to parents who are U.S. citizens under the \\"natural born\\" requirement. Several holders of the offices of President and Vice President have touched on questions of whether they were natural-born: * Chester A. Arthur, President from 1881 to 1885, was born in the U.S. state of Vermont of an American mother and Irish father. His status as a natural-born citizen was challenged by a political opponent during the 1880 campaign, who claimed Arthur had been born in Canada or Ireland. * Charles Curtis, Vice President from 1929 to 1933, was born in Kansas Territory, which was not a US state. * Presidential candidates George W. Romney (born in Mexico), Ted Cruz (born in Canada), Barry Goldwater, and John McCain (born in U.S. territories), were not born within a US state but were born to US citizens. Their natural-born status was never seriously challenged. * Barack Obama, President from 2009 to 2017, was born in the U.S. state of Hawaii of an American mother and Kenyan father. He was the subject of several racist conspiracy theories that claimed he had been born in Kenya and was thus not natural-born. Oath of allegiance During the naturalization ceremony, the applications are required to swear the following Oath of Allegiancehttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/article/M-476.pdf =Expeditious naturalization of children - INA ¬ß 322= A person holding up their certificate of derivative citizenship. Effective February 27, 2001, the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 provided that a child born outside the U.S. to a U.S. citizen parent, if not already a citizen by birth because the parent does not meet the residency requirement (see above), may qualify for expeditious naturalization based on the physical presence of the child's grandparent in the U.S. The grandparent should have spent five years in the U.S., at least two of which were after the age of 14. The process of naturalization, including the oath of allegiance, must be completed before the child's 18th birthday. It is not necessary for the child to be admitted to the U.S. as a lawful permanent resident. =Automatic citizenship - INA ¬ß 320= Effective February 27, 2001, the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 provided that a non-U.S. citizen child (aged under 18) with a U.S. citizen parent, and in the custody of that parent while resident in the United States, automatically acquired U.S. citizenship. To be eligible, a child must meet the definition of \\"child\\" for naturalization purposes under immigration law, and must also meet the following requirements: * The child has at least one United States citizen parent (by birth or naturalization) * The child is under 18 years of age * The child is currently residing permanently in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the United States citizen parent * The child has been admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident or has been adjusted to this status * An adopted child must also meet the requirements applicable to the particular provision under which they qualified for admission as an adopted child under immigration law Dual citizenship Based on the U.S. Department of State regulation on dual citizenship (7 FAM 082), the Supreme Court of the United States has stated that dual citizenship is a \\"status long recognized in the law\\" and that \\"a person may have and exercise rights of nationality in two countries and be subject to the responsibilities of both. The mere fact he asserts the rights of one citizenship does not, without more, mean that he renounces the other\\", Kawakita v. U.S., 343 U.S. 717 (1952). In Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163 (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a naturalized U.S. citizen has the right to return to his native country and to resume his former citizenship, and also to remain a U.S. citizen even if he never returns to the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) neither defines dual citizenship nor takes a position for it or against it. There has been no prohibition against dual citizenship, but some provisions of the INA and earlier U.S. nationality laws were designed to reduce situations in which dual citizenship exists. Although naturalizing citizens are required to undertake an oath renouncing previous allegiances, the oath has never been enforced to require the actual termination of original citizenship. Although the U.S. government does not endorse dual citizenship as a matter of policy, it recognizes the existence of dual citizenship and completely tolerates the maintenance of multiple citizenship by U.S. citizens. In the past, claims of other countries on dual-national U.S. citizens sometimes placed them in situations where their obligations to one country were in conflict with the laws of the other. However, as fewer countries require military service and most base other obligations (such as the payment of taxes) on residence and not citizenship, these conflicts have become less frequent. A U.S. citizen may lose his or her dual citizenship by obtaining naturalization in a foreign state, by taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, by serving in the armed forces of a foreign state, or by performing certain other acts, but only if the act was performed \\"voluntarily and with the intention to relinquish U.S. nationality\\". One circumstance where dual citizenship may run counter to expectations of government agencies is in matters of security clearance. For example, any person granted a Yankee White vetting must be absolutely free of foreign influence, and for other security clearances one of the grounds that may result in a rejected application is an actual or potential conflict of national allegiances. Travel freedom of U.S. citizens upright=3.1|thumb|center|Countries and territories with visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries for holders of regular United States passports Visa requirements for the United States citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of United States. According to the 2019 Henley Passport Index, holders of a United States passport can visit 185 countries and territories visa-free or with visa on arrival. The United States passport is currently ranked jointly 6th alongside the UK in terms of travel freedom in the world. In 2017, the United States nationality is ranked twenty-seventh in the Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition to travel freedom, on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well. Nationals Although all U.S. citizens are also U.S. nationals, the reverse is not true. As specified in , a person whose only connection to the U.S. is through birth in an outlying possession (which is defined in as American Samoa and Swains Island, which is administered as part of American Samoa), or through descent from a person so born, acquires U.S. nationality but not U.S. citizenship. This was formerly the case in only four other current or former U.S. overseas possessions:In the Panama Canal Zone only those persons born there prior to January 1, 2000 with at least one parent as a U.S. citizen were recognized as U.S. citizens and were both nationals and citizens.

Like permanent residents, they are not currently allowed by any U.S. state to vote in federal or state elections, although, as with permanent residents, there is no constitutional prohibition against their doing so.

Citizenship at birth on the U.S. territories and former U.S. territories The 14th amendment applies to incorporated territories, so people born in incorporated territories of the U.S. (currently, only the Palmyra Atoll) are automatically U.S. citizens at birth. 7 FAM 1121.2-1 Definition of Terms Separate sections of law handle territories that the United States has acquired over time, such as Alaska and Hawaii , both incorporated, and unincorporated Puerto Rico , the U.S. Virgin Islands , and Guam . Each of these sections confer citizenship on persons living in these territories as of a certain date, and usually confer native-born status on persons born in incorporated territories after that date. For example, for Puerto Rico, all persons born in Puerto Rico between April 11, 1899, and January 12, 1941, were automatically conferred U.S. citizenship as of the date the law was signed by the President Harry S. Truman on June 27, 1952. Additionally, all persons born in Puerto Rico on or after January 13, 1941, are citizens at birth of the United States. Note that because of when the law was passed, for some, the citizenship status was retroactive. The law contains one other section of historical note, concerning the Panama Canal Zone and the nation of Panama. In , the law states that anyone born in the Canal Zone or in Panama itself, on or after February 26, 1904, to a mother or father who is a United States citizen, was \\"declared\\" to be a United States citizen at birth. All persons born in the U.S. Virgin Islands on or after February 25, 1927, are native-born citizens of the United States. The also indicate that all the persons and their children born in the U.S. Virgin Islands subsequent to January 17, 1917, and prior to February 25, 1927, are declared to be citizens of the United States as of February 25, 1927 if complied with the U.S. law dispositions. All persons born in Alaska on or after June 2, 1924, are native- born citizens of the United States. Alaska was declared a U.S. state on January 3, 1959. All persons born in Hawaii on or after April 30, 1900, are native-born citizens of the United States. Hawaii was declared a U.S. state on August 21, 1959. All persons born in the island of Guam on or after April 11, 1899 (whether before or after August 1, 1950) subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, are declared to be citizens of the United States. Currently under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA) effective from December 24, 1952 to present the definition of the \\"United States\\" for nationality purposes, was expanded to add Guam; and, effective November 3, 1986, the Northern Mariana Islands (in addition to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands of the United States).See 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101(a)(36) and 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101(a)(38) Providing the term \\"State\\" and \\"United States\\" definitions on the U.S. Federal Code, Immigration and Nationality Act . Persons born in these territories on or after December 24, 1952 acquire U.S. citizenship at birth on the same terms as persons born in other parts of the United States; and \\"Outlying possessions of the United States\\" was restricted to American Samoa and Swains Island. Congressional Research Service Report number RL30527 of April 17, 2000, titled \\"Presidential Elections in the United States: A Primer\\" asserts that citizens born in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are legally defined as natural born citizens, and are, therefore, also eligible to be elected president. A December 12, 2019 ruling by U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups struck down the special status of American Samoans as non-citizen US nationals as unconstitutional, holding that \\"any State Department policy that provides that the citizenship provisions of the Constitution do not apply to persons born in American Samoa violates the 14th Amendment.\\" Government attorneys had argued that \\"Such a novel holding would be contrary to the decisions of every court of appeals to have considered the question, inconsistent with over a century of historical practice by all three branches of the United States government, and conflict with the strong objection of the local government of American Samoa.\\" Waddoups stayed his ruling on December 13 pending appellate review, so it has not taken immediate effect. Under the law apart from Waddoups's ruling, most of the people of American Samoa are treated as \\"nationals but not citizens of the United States at birth\\"; thus, American Samoans cannot vote in US elections. Loss of citizenship A Certificate of Loss of Nationality, signifying that the bearer has relinquished or renounced their U.S. nationality. As a historical matter, U.S. citizenship could be forfeited upon the undertaking of various acts, including naturalization in a foreign state (with a willful intent to renounce U.S. citizenship) or service in foreign armed forces. In addition, before 1967 it was possible to lose the citizenship due to voting in foreign elections. However, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the provisions of Section 349(a) which provided for loss of nationality by voting in a foreign election in the case Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, specifically outlines how loss of nationality may occur, which predominantly involves willful acts over the age of 18 with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality. U.S. Supreme Court decisions beginning with Afroyim v. Rusk constitutionally limited the government's capacity to terminate citizenship to those cases in which an individual engaged in conduct with an intention of abandoning their citizenship. In 1990, the U.S. State Department adopted new regulations which presume that an individual does not intend to give up citizenship when performing one of the above potentially expatriating acts. If asked, the individual can always answer that they did not intend to give it up; this is sufficient to retain their citizenship. Hence, the U.S. effectively allows citizens to acquire new citizenships while remaining a U.S. citizen, becoming a dual citizen. After a U.S. citizen satisfies the Department of State procedures, the Department of State issues a Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN) signifying that the Department of State has accepted the U.S. Embassy/Consulate's recommendation to allow the renunciation. Renunciation of citizenship includes renunciation of all rights and privileges of citizenship. A person who wants to renounce U.S. citizenship cannot decide to retain some of the privileges of citizenship, as the State Department regards this as logically inconsistent with the concept of renunciation. Thus, such a person can be said to lack a full understanding of renouncing citizenship or lack the necessary intent to renounce citizenship, and the Department of State will not approve a loss of citizenship in such instances. People giving up U.S. citizenship may be subject to an expatriation tax. Originally, under the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966, people determined to be giving up citizenship for the purpose of avoiding U.S. taxation were subject to 10 years of continued taxation on their U.S.-source income, to prevent ex-citizens from taking advantage of special tax incentives offered to foreigners investing in the United States. Since 2008, these provisions no longer apply; instead, ex-citizens who meet certain asset or tax liability thresholds pay a one-time capital gains tax on a deemed sale of their U.S. and non-U.S. assets, regardless of their reasons for giving up citizenship. The Reed Amendment, a 1996 law, makes former citizens inadmissible to the U.S. if the Attorney General finds that they renounced citizenship for purposes of avoiding taxes; however, it has never been enforced. Proposals such as the Ex- PATRIOT Act to rewrite the Reed Amendment and make it enforceable failed in 2012 and 2013. It is also possible to forfeit U.S. citizenship upon conviction for an act of treason against the United States. Prominent former Nazi officers who acquired American citizenship have also had it revoked if the Office of Special Investigations has been able to prove that the citizenship was obtained by concealing their involvement in war crimes committed by the Nazis in World War II.

Retrieved: May 10, 2012. Plot In the late 1980s, a group of dissident officials in the Soviet Union has grown afraid of losing power as relations improve with the United States. Hoping to oust the Soviet President, they steal a nuclear missile and launch it at the Soviet city of Donetsk from a site in NATO member Turkey. The Soviet automated defense systems, believing a NATO attack is in progress, execute a measured launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at the United States. As the stolen missile detonates over Donetsk and destroys the city, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) scrambles its forces. SAC Commander General Renning urges the president of the United States to authorize a full counterattack. The Soviet leader contacts his American counterpart, explaining the dissidents' actions. He asks the US to stand down, but he is willing to accept an American counterstrike if it is exactly equal to the Soviet's first strike, costing each side six to nine million people. If the United States launches an all-out attack, the Soviets will respond in kind, dooming the whole planet. The president and General Renning argue about the message from the Soviet leader until it appears that the Soviets have launched a second attack. The president authorizes a multi- part all-out attack, with American ICBMs launched immediately, then submarine- launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a few hours, coincident with the arrival of USAF bombers over the Soviet Union. General Renning issues the orders just before the first wave hits SAC headquarters, then quickly passes command of SAC to \\"Alice\\", the code name of a USAF General in command of \\"Looking Glass\\", a flying command aircraft for the Air Force and the Navy. The president is ushered to Marine One. As the helicopter lifts off, he learns that the second Soviet attack was not directed at the United States but rather at the People's Republic of China. This country has launched its own missiles at the Soviet Union, adding untold millions of deaths in those two countries. Realizing his mistake, the president tries to cancel his orders for the all- out nuclear retaliation, but before he can, a nearby nuclear detonation knocks his helicopter out of the sky. A B-52 bomber, callsign \\"Polar Bear 1\\", takes flight just minutes before an ICBM wipes out Fairchild Air Force Base. The bomber is commanded by male Major Cassidy and his female co-pilot Captain Moreau. The crewmen are shaken by the unfolding events, with Tyler struggling with the fact that his family was just killed at Fairchild. While flying, a nuclear warhead detonates close to \\"Polar Bear 1\\", the nuclear flash half blinds Moreau, and the ensuing shockwave throws a crewman into his instrument panel, breaking his neck and killing him. An American admiral, code named \\"Harpoon\\", is in command of Nightwatch, a flying command platform for the president. With the president presumed dead, they swear in the Secretary of the Interior (number eight on the succession list, per the novel) as the new president, code named \\"Condor\\". Harpoon informs Condor of the last communication from the Soviet President, the mistake regarding China, the matching damage already done by the initial retaliation with American ICBMs, and advises that the United States agree to the ceasefire. Colonel Fargo, a hawkish advisor on Nightwatch, who believes that the Soviets are playing a trick, advises Condor that the only path to victory is quick destruction of the Soviet Union. Polar Bear 1 is attacked by a trio of MiG-25s over Alaska. One is shot down by the B-52's rear machine guns. The crew then drop one of their nuclear bombs on one side of a mountain range, using the other side of the mountain to shield their plane from the blast, destroying the other two MiG-25s. Condor agrees with Col. Fargo's plan to move forward with a submarine missile and bomber attack. Harpoon disagrees, and he attempts to hide his nuclear authentication codes, but they are forcibly taken by Col. Fargo. Fargo and Condor contact Alice, giving the authentication codes and ordering him to execute the remainder of the attack plan. Alice advises against this course of action, but obeys his orders and begins to organize the bombers for the attack. The attack orders are received by Polar Bear 1. Moreau argues that their target will kill off all Soviet leadership, leaving nobody to \\"turn [the war] off\\". Cassidy hands her a suicide pill, but then he breaks down and begs her not to go. The crewmen agree to turn back, but Tyler, despondent over the loss of his family, displays increasingly erratic behavior with the news causing him to descend into full insanity. Tyler attacks Cassidy over the news and has to be restrained as a result. He later attempts to shoot the pilots for cowardice, then uses an ejection seat, blowing everyone but the two pilots out of the aircraft. The original president has survived the crash of Marine One, but he is seriously injured with both legs broken and he is also blind. A family gets him to a FEMA emergency shelter. By way of a FEMA communication system, he learns what Condor is doing, then manages to contact the Soviet President. The Soviets promise to stand off for one hour to see if the US Air Force will recall its bombers. On board Looking Glass, Alice notices that Polar Bear 1 has abandoned its attack run, and sees that the Soviets have turned one of their own bomber squadrons back in response. Alice begs Condor to view this as a sign that the Soviets are willing to call a ceasefire and asks for permission to recall all American bombers. Condor instead orders Alice to send US Navy carrier-based fighters to shoot down Polar Bear 1. When Alice hesitates, Fargo informs Condor that they can figure a way to send the launch commands from Nightwatch, at which point Condor dismisses Alice and cuts off communication with Looking Glass. The original president contacts Alice. He lost his authentication codes in the helicopter crash, but he calls Alice by his real name as proof of who he is. Alice and the staff of Looking Glass agree to follow the real president's orders and they order a recall of the bombers with the Soviets following suit. However, Alice lacks the authority to call off the submarine attack. Two American carrier-based F/A-18 fighter jets from the USS Midway intercept the crippled Polar Bear 1, now flying low over the Pacific Ocean. As the fighters begin their attack runs, they receive word that their ship has been hit by a Soviet torpedo and it is sinking. Doomed to run out of fuel in the open ocean, they bid Polar Bear 1 good luck, unwilling to doom their fellow American pilots alongside them. The real president finally connects with Condor. Condor doubts it is him and Col. Fargo suggests that it is a Soviet impersonator. Condor states that the president he knew would want a military victory, and disconnects. Fearing the \\"president impersonator\\" might try to cancel the American SLBM launch, Condor orders the Nightwatch staff to find a way to connect to the US Navy submarines which they succeed in doing by linking to Soviet satellites. The Looking Glass staff and crewmen agree with Alice's decision to ram Looking Glass into Nightwatch, before Condor can send his launch orders. Looking Glass had been flying to rendezvous with Nightwatch for some time, and now makes all effort to close the remaining gap. Fargo realizes what Looking Glass is doing, so Condor orders his pilot to fly evasively until the launch orders can be transmitted. Realizing what Condor and Fargo plan to do, the pilots of Nightwatch sacrifice themselves, turning their aircraft into the path of the oncoming Looking Glass rather than allow Condor and Fargo to escalate the war. Once the two planes are destroyed, the real president successfully issues a message to stand down on the American attack. Having survived with low fuel in Polar Bear 1, Cassidy and Moreau are left wondering what happens next, but recognize that now there will be a future for everyone to figure it out.

Originally an offshoot of the Communist Party of America, the group maintained an independent existence for over five decades. It is best remembered for carrying forward Charles H. Kerr & Co., the oldest publisher of Marxist books in America.  Organizational history  =Formation= Al Renner, a key figure in the Proletarian Party of America during its formative period. The Proletarian Party of America (PPA) emerged from the Socialist Party of Michigan, based in Detroit in 1920, but the organization's story dates to a few years prior to this event. The Michigan party, the state affiliate of the Socialist Party of America (SPA), was won over to a unique Left Wing ideology during the years of American participation in World War I. The key figure in the Michigan organization which later became the PPA was a Scottish born shoe store owner named John Keracher, in association with a tool and die maker named Dennis Batt and radical activists Al Renner and H. M. Wicks.Allen Ruff, \\"We Called Each Other Comrade\\": Charles H. Kerr & Co., Radical Publishers, Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1997, pg. 201. At Keracher's behest, the Socialist Party of Michigan eschewed all participation in electoral politics, instead favoring Marxist theoretical study to prepare the working class for the task of revolutionary leadership. Throughout the years of 1918 and 1919, the party established a network of Marxist study circles called \\"Proletarian Universities,\\" with the movement particularly strong in Detroit, Chicago, and Rochester, New York. At the 1919 State Convention of the Socialist Party of Michigan, Keracher was elected head of the state organization and an amendment was adopted by the assembled delegates calling for the expulsion from the Socialist Party of Michigan of anyone who engaged in electoral politics. Keracher, Batt, and other Michiganders were prominent as well in the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, a formal faction deeply inspired by the Russian Revolution which was engaged in the attempt to \\"win the Socialist Party for the Left Wing.\\" The Left Wing Section organized candidate slates for each of the electoral districts of the SPA and made use of bloc voting by sympathetic branches of the party's language federations to achieve results. The outgoing National Executive Committee of the SPA cried election fraud, however, and refused to tally the results of the 1919 party election or to leave office on July 1, the appointed date. Instead, the outgoing NEC went on the offensive with a series of suspensions of language federations and the expulsion of the Michigan party, ostensibly for violation of the national constitution of the SPA for the anti-political provisions adopted at the 1919 state gathering. Keracher and the Michigan socialists allied with the suspended language federations in calling for immediate formation of a Communist Party of America, as opposed to the tactics advocated by Alfred Wagenknecht and L.E. Katterfeld of the NEC of continuing the fight to its conclusion at the 1919 Emergency National Convention of the SPA, scheduled for August 30 in Chicago. Wagenknecht, Katterfeld, and their associates wound up bolting the Emergency National Convention to establish the Communist Labor Party of America, while Keracher, Batt, and the federations formed a rival Communist Party of America. Two years of bitter struggle followed between these competing Communist organizations.The best published account of this conflict is in Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking, 1957. Proletarian Party leader John Keracher as he appeared in the 1940s. The idiosyncratic Michiganders were a poor match for the disciplined and highly orthodox Communists of the federations led by Alexander Stoklitsky, Oscar Tyverovsky, and Nicholas Hourwich of the Russian Communist Federation and Joseph Stilson of the Lithuanian Communist Federation. Early in 1920, a split ensued, due in part to the decision of the Michigan group to continue the public operation of the Proletarian Universities and to publish their monthly journal, The Proletarian, outside of the control of the Central Executive Committee. The Communist Party's Executive Secretary, C.E. Ruthenberg, recalled the necessary change of the Communist Party to an underground organization after the Palmer Raids of January 1920 as the root cause of the problem: > \\"The Proletarian group was still part of the Communist Party in January 1920 > after the raids. I personally went to Detroit to reorganize the CP and > conferred with [Al] Renner, [A.J.] MacGregor, and [John] Keracher. They > refused to become part of an underground party. They were dropped out of the > CP in February 1920 because they refused to have any part in the > reorganization.\\"Ruthenberg, C.E., \\"\\"Comments Regarding the Wicks Memorandum > on the Proletarian Party of America,\\" Comintern Archive, RGASPI, f. 515, op. > 1, d. 168, l. 43. Published as a downloadable pdf at > http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/parties/cpusa/1922/12/1200-ruth- > onwicksmemo.pdf The expelled Michigan \\"Proletarian University\\" would soon establish themselves as the Proletarian Party of America. The new party attempted without success to gain affiliation with the Communist International for a few years before eventually abandoning the mission. In 1922, the unified CPUSA attempted to recruit the PPA into its legal arm, the Workers Party of America and the Trade Union Educational League on its own terms, to no avail. =The Proletarian Party and Charles H. Kerr & Co.= Keracher's work with Detroit's Proletarian University had brought him into close contact with Charles H. Kerr, founder of Charles H. Kerr & Co., the largest Marxist publishing house in the United States. Keracher became a member of the Kerr Board of the Directors in 1924 and in 1928 Charles Kerr sold him the bulk of his controlling shares in the firm. Thereafter, the Proletarian Party controlled the operations of Kerr & Co., publishing a number of Keracher's works, including How the Gods Were Made (1929), Producers and Parasites (1935), The Head-Fixing Industry (1935), Crime: It's Causes and Consequences (1937), and Frederick Engels (1946).Allen Ruff, \\"We Called Each Other Comrade\\": Charles H. Kerr & Co., Radical Publishers, pg. 204. Owing to poor finances, few other new Kerr titles were ever published by the PPA, although the backlist of the company was no doubt invaluable in maintaining the organization's solvency. H. M. Wicks wound up returning to the Communist Party of America, where he was known as a bitter factionalist. Dennis Batt retired from radical politics after a time, to become a labor journalist and staunch supporter of the American Federation of Labor. The banner of the PPA and Charles H. Kerr & Co. was carried forward by Al Wysocki following Keracher's retirement as National Secretary in 1954.Allen Ruff, \\"We Called Each Other Comrade\\": Charles H. Kerr & Co., Radical Publishers, pg. 201. =Publications= Proletarian News was the final publication produced by the PPA, terminating in July 1960. The official organ of the PPA was a monthly magazine called The Proletarian, which originally served a newsheet for the left wing inside the Socialist Party of Michigan. The Proletarian launched in May 1918 and continued to be issued each month until July 1931, when it was superseded by Proletarian News, which was launched in 1932 and terminated in July 1960. Both publications were monthlies.Walter Goldwater, Radical Periodicals in America, 1890-1950. New Haven: Yale University Library, 1964; pg. 33. During its final years, Proletarian News was produced via mimeograph owing to the small size of the party membership. In 1923 the party briefly experimented with a four page weekly Labor Digest: Devoted to the Working Class Struggle for Power. The newspaper last twelve issues from June 2, 1923 to September 22, 1923.Goldwater, Radical Periodicals in America, 1890-1950, pg. 20. Throughout its history, the group also published an irregular mimeographed internal discussion newsletter called Proletarian Bulletin, as well as a short-lived publication for its youth section, Proletarian Youth.Not available on microfilm, these publications may be found by scholars in the Proletarian Party papers at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. =Electoral politics= The Proletarian Party periodically ran its own candidates for electoral office, particularly in the state of Michigan, where it retained some organizational viability. In 1932 the party ran two candidates in that state, Al Renner for Governor and Anthony Bielekas for Secretary of State.\\"Many Candidates on Ballot for Election,\\" Ironwood [MI] Times, Oct. 21, 1932, pg. 2. =Decline and demise= Proletarian Party dues stamps, circa 1950s. Dues in the PPA cost $1 per month during the 1950s, with these stamps affixed to party cards and cancelled to denote dues having been paid. The party suffered two known splits in the 1930s. During one in the early 1930s a faction of the parties youth group split off to join with a group of German Left Communists to form the United Workers Party, which soon changed its name to the Council Communists.Paul Mattick \\"New Essays\\" in Joseph R.

Two collections of her poetry were published in her lifetime, and a small selection also appeared after her death. Early life and publications Fredegond Cecily Maitland was the daughter of a legal historian, Frederic William Maitland, and his wife Florence Henrietta Fisher. Her mother was a maternal first cousin to Virginia Woolf and sister of Adeline Maria Fisher, the wife of Ralph Vaughan Williams. Her mother's second marriage to Francis Darwin in 1913 brought her in contact with his extended family. She attended Newnham College in 1910‚Äì1913 and during that period also spent time in London with the Vaughan Williams. In 1915 she married the economist Gerald Shove, who like her own family, had links with the Bloomsbury group. As a conscientious objector doing farming as his alternative service, he worked at Garsington Manor near Oxford for most of 1916-1917.Sophie Lord, \\"Fredegond Shove\\", Modernist Archives The future Juliette Huxley, who was working there as a French tutor, later reminisced: \\"In those days...

One of them, \\"The Farmer 1917\\", conjures an evocative rural scene amidst the anguish of war, which made it a candidate for The Paths of Glory (1919), a post-war anthology covering the broader field of poetry written during the period.p.98 It was later anthologized in Modern British Poetry (New York 1925), Twentieth Century Verse (Toronto 1945), Men who March away (London 1965) and the Penguin Book of World War 1 Poetry (2006). Another obliquely anti-war poem, \\"A man dreams that he is the creator\\",poem 10 had appeared in Norman Angell's pacifist monthly War and Peace before inclusion in Dreams and Journeys. The following year it appeared in the American anthology The Book of Modern British Verse (Boston, 1919)p.10 and translated by Rafael Cansinos-Ass√©ns in the Hispano-American review Cervantes.Madrid, September 1919, p.73 \\"The spirit trembled and sprang up at the Lord‚Äôs word\\", The New Ghost The poem in Shove's collection referred to most often was \\"The New Ghost\\", a mystical description of a departing soul met by the Divine in a springtime setting. It has an almost conversational rhythm.Dreams and Journeys p.37 It was among four chosen for Georgian Poetry 1918‚Äì19, and in 1925 it was set to music by Ralph Vaughan Williams as one of his Four Poems by Fredegond Shove.Sheet music In trying to typify the poetic trends of the time, the introduction to An Anthology of Modern Verse (1921) called it a sign \\"that something like a return to religion is in process.\\"p.xxxii For Robert Strachan in his Edinburgh lectures on contemporary writing it was \\"a very remarkable short poem... unique in modern poetry\\",The Soul of Modern Poetry (1922), pp.245‚Äì258.

As late as 1958 it appeared in another Anglo-American anthology: Modern Verse in English 1900‚Äì1950.Edited by David Cecil and Allen Tate, p. 345. Her inclusion in Georgian PoetryContents list as \\"the first, arguably token, woman\\" to appear in the series caused some ill will in the poetry politics of the time. She was preferred to other candidates who were being urged on the editor as more experienced and progressive, such as Charlotte Mew, Rose Macaulay and Edith Sitwell.Encyclopaedia of British Women‚Äôs Writing, p.96 Later critics have been unkind about Vaughan Williams' use of her work, speculating that he only set her poems because of their family relationshipTrevor Hold, Parry to Finzi: Twenty English Song-composers, Boydell Press 2002, p.118 and describing her as \\"a wholly unexceptional poet\\".Simon Heffer, Vaughan Williams, London 2014 Even so, the 1920s for her were a time of popularity and prosperity.

Later life In 1922 Fredegond Shove‚Äôs second collection, Daybreak, was published by the Woolfs from their Hogarth Press,Online archive but there is no evidence that the 23 poems there made the same impact. Something is there of her earlier manner, which Harold Monro had characterised as \\"an uncanny sense of the reality beneath fact.

William Countryman, Living on the Border of the Holy, Morehouse Publishing 1999, p.8 Fredegond Shove's one other book in her lifetime was her study of Christina Rossetti (Cambridge 1931).Excerpts at Google Books However, she continued to write poetry throughout her life, publishing selections from time to time. In Atalanta's Garland (1926) there are three poems.Atalanta‚Äôs Garland, being the Book of the Edinburgh University Women's Union, mentioned in the Charlotte Mew Chronology at Middlesex University Lascelles Abercrombie, one of her associates from Georgian Poetry, asked for previously unpublished work to include in his anthology New English Poems in 1931,pp. 316‚Äì321. and the following year she was asked by Charles du Bos for poems to include in his Catholic review Vigile, for which he provided prose translations.Vigile 1/1932, Paris, pp.167-80 After her death in 1949, she was buried with her husband and other family members in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge. Her sister Ermengarde Maitland (1887‚Äì1968) acted as her literary executor and had the poet's brief memoirs of her early years and married life privately published as Fredegond and Gerald Shove (1952). In the introduction to this, she described sorting through the house and finding poems \\"everywhere: fairly copied in note-books, scribbled on bits of paper, stuffed into bookcases, cupboards and desks ‚Äì one would not have been surprised to have found them in the oven ‚Äì literally hundreds of poems.\\"\\"Preface: the Child and the Poet\\" in Gerald and Fredegond Shove, p. ix. A small selection of 32 poems was later published by Cambridge University Press in 1956. Included in this were some from her two earlier books, a few that had appeared in various places since, and more that were unpublished. In the prefatory note, Ermengarde summarised her sister's account of the interior vision impelling her to write. \\"She told of her earliest sense of 'the Almighty's sheltering roof tree', of the fear that came to her as she viewed this 'secondary world'. 'I was shocked and sickened at the ways of one world, whilst I clung, ever more secretly, to the faint legacy which the other had left me.' She told also of that day at the age of fourteen 'in the charity of the brown autumn sunlight, I felt myself to be one of those who must try to relate their experiences, and to whom experiences are scenes, colours and sounds always, rather than events or actions.'\\"P*o*e*m*s by Fredegond Shove, pp.vii-viii It is as faithful a characterisation of her work as any.

Since debuting in 1990, Saturn wrestled for promotions including Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He was a former ECW World Tag Team Champion, WCW World Tag Team Champion, WCW World Television Champion, WWF European Champion and WWF Hardcore Champion. Early life Satullo enlisted in the United States Army for four years at the age of seventeen, before eventually embarking on a career in professional wrestling.Cagematch Profile: Perry Saturn Satullo finished a bachelor's degree before he became a full-time wrestler.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqPUM_GAjEA Satullo is also a certified graduate of the U.S. Army Ranger School. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1990‚Äì1995)= Satullo began training as a professional wrestler at Killer Kowalski's school in Malden, Massachusetts around 1988, taking the ring name Saturn from the Roman god of the same name before later tweaking it to Perry Saturn. He debuted on October 27, 1990 in Waltham, Massachusetts, wrestling for the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). Satullo also wrestled in Kowalski's International Wrestling Federation as \\"The Iron Horseman\\", a cowboy complete with black leather stetson and chaps. Satullo eventually won the IWF Light Heavyweight Championship. Satullo began wrestling for independent promotions throughout New England, as well as touring Japan with New Japan Pro Wrestling in 1993. In 1992 he worked as a jobber in WWF. While working as the manager of a nightclub in Boston, Satullo met bouncer George Caiazzo, who expressed an interest in becoming a wrestler. Satullo sent Caiazzo to Kowalski's school to train, and then offered to form a tag team with him. The Greek equivalent of the god Saturn was Cronus, so Satullo chose the ring name \\"John Kronus\\" for Caiazzo. As Saturn and Cronus were their cultures' respective gods of the harvest, Satullo proposed that they be known as \\"The Harvesters of Sorrow\\". Promoter Jerry Lawler advised Satullo that the significance of the name would not be evident to many fans, so they became known as The Eliminators. The Eliminators wrestled their first match together at a USWA house show in 1993. They were hired at a starting salary of $40 a week (they later successfully negotiated a 100% pay rise), and shared an apartment with four other wrestlers. The Eliminators won the World Tag Team Championship on May 2, 1994 from Satullo's mentor, Eddie Gilbert, and Brian Christopher. They held the titles until June 13 when they were defeated by PG-13. Satullo later traveled to Japan with Caiazzo to wrestle for Wrestle Association \\"R\\". On March 22, 1994 Saturn wrestled a dark match at a WWF Superstars taping in Lowell, MA.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995‚Äì1997)= The compactly-built and heavily tattooed Satullo and the high-flying Caiazzo caught the attention of Paul Heyman's Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) when they were brought in to job to the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott), and the Eliminators were hired by ECW in 1995. Heyman quickly abandoned plans to give them a sadism and masochism gimmick and instead booked them as an unstoppable force in the ECW tag division, giving them a manager, Jason. The Eliminators captured the ECW Tag Team Titles three times between 1996 and 1997, and feuded with teams such as The Gangstas and The Pitbulls. After The Pitbulls' manager Francine cut Saturn's hair, he shaved his head in a homage to Mickey Knox, the character depicted by Woody Harrelson in Natural Born Killers (in reality, Satullo was beginning to go bald). Satullo was a trainer in the ECW House of Hardcore, a professional wrestling school at which Taz and Mikey Whipwreck also taught. Saturn was respected for his focus and drive on fundamentals and technical wrestling. On May 31, 1997 in Trenton, New Jersey, Satullo tore his ACL when he landed on a crutch while executing a kick on Big Dick Dudley. After intense reconstructive surgery, Satullo was given a recovery time of up to a year. He began rehabilitating after two months and returned to action in August. Satullo, however, had become impatient with what he regarded as Caiazzo's lack of motivation and dedication, and refused to reform the Eliminators. Paul Heyman offered to release him from his contract if he could find alternative employment, and Satullo entered into negotiations with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). =World Championship Wrestling= Raven's Flock (1997-1998) On August 28, 1997 Satullo was offered a job by WCW road agent Terry Taylor, who had been impressed by a bump that Satullo had taken in a scaffold match. He debuted in WCW on September 8, facing Billy Kidman, but was sidelined for a month afterwards as his knee had still not entirely healed. Later that year, both Saturn and Kidman would go on to join The Flock, a heel stable of misfits and misanthropists led by the nihilistic Raven. Saturn's childhood was referenced, with Raven bringing up the violence Saturn incurred at the hands of his stepfather. The enforcer of The Flock, Saturn would win gold on November 3, 1997 when he defeated Disco Inferno to win the World Television Championship. He held the title for a month before losing it back to Inferno in a rematch. Beginning in 1998, Saturn began feuding with Glacier after Saturn's usage of the Super Kick offended Glacier, who deemed it a plagiarism of his Cryonic Kick finisher. Later in the year, Saturn was defeated by fellow Flock member Van Hammer in a \\"Loser Leaves The Flock\\" match. However, Raven opted to throw Hammer out of the Flock instead. Problems began to arise between Raven and Saturn, and the latter eventually left The Flock, turning face by standing up to the domineering Raven. Raven held all the other Flock members in thrall, so Saturn challenged him to match for the September 13 Fall Brawl pay-per-view. If Saturn won, The Flock would be freed, but if Raven won, Saturn would become his slave. In the meantime, on the August 26 episode of Nitro, Raven's lackey Lodi challenged him to a match, with the stipulation that Lodi would leave The Flock if Saturn won, and Saturn would become Lodi's servant until Fall Brawl if he lost. Saturn unexpectedly lost following copious interference from The Flock, and Lodi forced Saturn to carry his bags, made him hold up pro-Lodi signs at ringside, and ordered him to chant Lodi's name while Lodi wrestled. Lodi also used Saturn to defeat the enemies of The Flock. Raven began questioning whether Saturn could \\"hurt those he wants to free so badly\\" and forced him to face Riggs. Saturn won cleanly, but refused Raven's order to break Riggs' fingers. When Saturn refused, Raven broke his fingers (Saturn would not break his agreement with Lodi because of a personal honor code which would not allow him to break his word, and Lodi ordered him to allow Raven to harm him). Raven repeatedly tried to goad Saturn into breaking his word, but was unable to do so. Finally, on September 13 at Fall Brawl, Saturn defeated Raven with help from Kidman, disbanding The Flock forever. The Revolution (1999-2000) Saturn went on to feud with Eddie Guerrero and Ernest Miller before beginning a rivalry with Chris Jericho. After Jericho cost Saturn a number of matches with the help of crooked referee Scott Dickinson, he mocked Saturn's complaints and accused him of crying \\"like a schoolgirl.\\" This led to Jericho challenging Saturn to a \\"loser wears a dress for ninety days\\" match at Souled Out on January 17, 1999, which he won after some suspect officiating from Dickinson. Taking on a bizarre, goth transvestite gimmick, Saturn began wearing a variety of dresses to the ring and using a variation of Marilyn Manson's \\"The Beautiful People\\" as his entrance music. He appeared to begin enjoying wearing dresses and even wore cosmetics to complement them. Saturn finally stopped wearing them after defeating Jericho in a dog collar match at Uncensored on March 14, 1999. Raven and Saturn reunited in March 1999, feuding with Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit, members of the Four Horsemen. At Slamboree the former Flock members defeated Benoit and Malenko and champions Rey Misterio, Jr. and Billy Kidman for the World Tag Team Championship. After Raven was injured, Saturn lost the titles to Bam Bam Bigelow and Diamond Dallas Page when Chris Kanyon, who substituted for Raven, betrayed him. He then teamed with Benoit in order to regain the titles. They were successful, but lost the titles several days later to Page and Kanyon. Benoit and Saturn continued to team together, and eventually formed a stable with Shane Douglas and Dean Malenko known as The Revolution. After Benoit left the Revolution to align himself with Bret Hart, the remainder of the stable began feuding with him. They then moved on to feuds with Jim Duggan and The Filthy Animals before disbanding. Booker Kevin Sullivan opined that Saturn was incapable of getting over with fans, prompting the wrestler to negotiate with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In January 2000, Saturn, along with Benoit, Malenko and Eddie Guerrero, was granted a release from WCW and signed a three-year contract with the WWF. =World Wrestling Federation= The Radicalz (2000-2001) Benoit, Guerrero, Saturn, and Malenko, dubbed The Radicalz, debuted in the WWF on January 31, 2000. They appeared in the front row of a live episode of Raw and brawled with the New Age Outlaws after The Road Dogg literally fell into their laps. Cactus Jack urged them to help him fight the heel McMahon-Helmsley Faction, but they quickly turned on Jack in order to gain employment from Triple H, who was then controlling the WWF. Benoit left the group on amicable terms when he became sidetracked by his feud with Chris Jericho, and the three remaining Radicalz began feuding with Too Cool and Chyna. After Guerrero left to be with Chyna, Saturn and Malenko teamed together for a while before disbanding. Saturn moved into the Hardcore division, pursuing then-champion Crash Holly. After Malenko tried to win the Hardcore Championship for himself, the former partners turned on one another. Guerrero was drawn into their feud, leading to a triple threat match at Judgment Day with Guerrero's European Championship on the line. Guerrero was able to retain with the assistance of Chyna. Saturn was later joined by Terri Runnels, who became his manager and onscreen girlfriend. After failing to proceed in the King of the Ring tournament, Saturn went after the European Championship once more, finally beating Guerrero at Fully Loaded on July 23. Terri's rivalry with The Kat led to a feud between Saturn and Al Snow, and on the August 31 episode of SmackDown! Snow defeated Saturn for the European Championship. The Radicalz reformed in late 2000, feuding with the revived D-Generation X and defeating them at Survivor Series. That same evening, the Radicalz attacked Stone Cold Steve Austin during his match with Triple H, briefly reforging their alliance with Triple H. Dean Malenko began trying to win the affections of Lita, the valet of The Hardy Boyz. This led to a feud between the Radicalz and The Hardy Boyz, with the former defeating the latter at Armageddon. Saturn helped Guerrero defeat Test at WrestleMania X-Seven, but Guerrero later left the Radicalz once more, again reducing the faction to just Saturn and Malenko (Benoit had left in early 2001), with Terri still accompanying Saturn. The remaining Radicalz returned to the tag team division. Final feuds and departure (2001-2002) After a match in which he legitimately attacked jobber Mike Bell, Saturn immediately underwent a significant gimmick change and, possibly as punishment for his actions, was involved in storylines about his becoming infatuated with a mop. After receiving head trauma in matches against The Acolytes Protection Agency and Raven, Saturn began acting eccentrically and speaking nonsensically, allegedly as the result of a concussion. Saturn began uttering the phrase \\"you're welcome\\" at inopportune intervals, and then fell in love with Moppy, an inanimate mop which he believed was alive, similar to Wilson the volleyball in the 2000 film Cast Away. This gimmick went over well with the fans, leading to a face turn. Terri Runnels told Saturn to choose between Moppy and her, and was infuriated when Saturn chose the mop. She left Saturn for Raven, who would help her enact vengeance on Saturn by stealing Moppy and feeding her into a woodchipper. Saturn in turn gained a measure of revenge when he defeated Raven at Unforgiven on September 23. After this, Saturn dropped the gimmick, but still remained a face, casually wrestling in tag matches at Sunday Night Heat. In March 2002 the WWF initiated its brand extension in which Raw and SmackDown would have their own rosters of WWF wrestlers. During the draft, Saturn was SmackDowns 29th pick, the 58th pick overall and the final pick of the entire draft. Then just a month later Saturn reinjured his ACL, sidelining him for four months, before being released by the company in November 2002. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003)= Saturn debuted in the Nashville, Tennessee- based promotion NWA-TNA on March 26, 2003, teaming with The Sandman and The Disciples of the New Church (Brian Lee and Slash) to defeat the Harris Brothers and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper). Saturn and The Sandman formed a short-lived stable known as \\"Team Extreme\\" with fellow ECW alumni Justin Credible and New Jack.http://cagematch.de/?id=29&nr;=426&gimmick;=Team+Extreme+++ On April 16, 2003, Saturn faced the debuting Mike Awesome, losing by disqualification after his stablemates interfered on his behalf. One week later, Saturn, New Jack and The Sandman defeated Awesome and The New Church in a hardcore match. Saturn wrestled his final match with NWA-TNA on June 18, 2003, defeating Kenzo Suzuki by disqualification. =International promotions (2002‚Äì2004)= Immediately after leaving the WWF, Saturn toured Europe with the World Wrestling All-Stars promotion in their European tour, mainly working against Sabu. Saturn worked for New Japan Pro Wrestling and on the American independent circuit before retiring from professional wrestling due to injuries in 2004. =Return to wrestling (2011‚Äìpresent)= Saturn returned to wrestling in 2011, wrestling his first match in over seven years on October 15, 2011 at the AWE Night of the Legends pay-per-view show from Fishersville, Virginia facing CW Anderson. Saturn won the match. Saturn won his first championship in over a decade as he defeated Arik Cannon & Sir Bradley Charles in a Triple Threat match for the 3XW Pure Wrestling championship on April 27 in Des Moines, Iowa. In March 2013, Saturn wrestled at Jerry Lynn's retirement show for Heavy On Wrestling in Minneapolis, MN. He competed in the opening six-man tag match, where his team came out victorious.http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/VIP_Exclusive_Features_21/article_69491.shtml Saturn entered the Extreme Rising World Championship tournament which was eventually won by Stevie Richards, he was defeated in the first round by Luke Hawx.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=26&nr;=2496 Personal life Satullo married Lisa Marie Kuhlemeier in June 2009. He has been married on three prior occasions. Satullo was involved in an April 2004 altercation with two men when he came to the aid of a woman that they were in the process of raping. He fought the men and was shot with a .25 caliber handgun in the back of the neck and in the right shoulder, to which he originally thought he had received a punch, (as stated in a YouShoot) as a result of the scuffle. After being shot, Satullo became addicted to methamphetamine and was homeless for two and a half years.1Wrestling.com \\"Back From Drugs and Homelessness Perry Saturn surfaces\\" Satullo disappeared from public view and was not seen for several years, with his family and friends unaware of his whereabouts.http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/6583/124/ Satullo re-emerged in 2010, having resolved his addiction. During an interview with Bill Apter in September 2016, Satullo revealed that he was dealing with a \\"traumatic brain injury\\" that limited his abilities. In November 2016, The Boston Globe reported that Satullo had joined a class action lawsuit against WWE, litigated by Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against them, alleging that \\"he is suffering from multiple symptoms of repetitive traumatic brain injuries and is undergoing neurological care.\\" US District judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in late 2018.

Illustration of private eye Sam Spade by Henry C. Murphy, Jr. Hardboiled (or hard-boiled) fiction is a literary genre that shares some of its characters and settings with crime fiction (especially detective fiction and noir fiction). The genre's typical protagonist is a detective who battles the violence of organized crime that flourished during Prohibition (1920‚Äì1933) and its aftermath, while dealing with a legal system that has become as corrupt as the organized crime itself. Rendered cynical by this cycle of violence, the detectives of hardboiled fiction are often antiheroes. Notable hardboiled detectives include Philip Marlowe, Mike Hammer, Sam Spade, Lew Archer, and The Continental Op. Genre pioneers The style was pioneered by Carroll John Daly in the mid-1920s, popularized by Dashiell Hammett over the course of the decade, and refined by James M. Cain and by Raymond Chandler beginning in the late 1930s. Its heyday was in 1930s‚Äì50s America.. Pulp fiction From its earliest days, hardboiled fiction was published in and closely associated with so-called pulp magazines. Pulp historian Robert Sampson argues that Gordon Young's \\"Don Everhard\\" stories (which appeared in Adventure magazine from 1917 onwards), about an \\"extremely tough, unsentimental, and lethal\\" gun-toting urban gambler, anticipated the hardboiled detective stories. \\"Extremely tough, unsentimental and lethal, Everhard foreshadowed the hard-boiled characters of the following decade\\". In its earliest uses in the late 1920s, \\"hardboiled\\" did not refer to a type of crime fiction; it meant the tough (cynical) attitude towards emotions triggered by violence. The hardboiled crime story became a staple of several pulp magazines in the 1930s; most famously Black Mask under the editorship of Joseph T. Shaw, but also in other pulps such as Dime Detective and Detective Fiction Weekly. A brief survey of the genre's early days, focusing on Black Mask. Consequently, \\"pulp fiction\\" is often used as a synonym for hardboiled crime fiction or gangster fiction; some would distinguish within it the private-eye story from the crime novel itself. Hardboiled/noir \\"family tree\\", by crime fiction author and scholar Megan Abbott. In the United States, the original hardboiled style has been emulated by innumerable writers, including James Ellroy, Paul Cain, Sue Grafton, Chester Himes, Paul Levine, John D. MacDonald, Ross Macdonald, Walter Mosley, Sara Paretsky, Robert B. Parker, and Mickey Spillane. Later, many hardboiled novels were published by houses specializing in paperback originals, most notably Gold Medal, and in later decades republished by houses such as Black Lizard.

Relation to noir fiction Hardboiled writing is also associated with \\"noir fiction\\". Eddie Duggan discusses the similarities and differences between the two related forms in his 1999 article on pulp writer Cornell Woolrich. In his full-length study of David Goodis, Jay Gertzman notes: \\"The best definition of hard boiled I know is that of critic Eddie Duggan. In noir, the primary focus is interior: psychic imbalance leading to self-hatred, aggression, sociopathy, or a compulsion to control those with whom one shares experiences. By contrast, hard boiled 'paints a backdrop of institutionalized social corruption.

The building was developed by Donald Trump and opened in 2001. The tower is located at 845 United Nations Plaza (First Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets, Manhattan). Construction began in 1999 and concluded in 2001. History and design Trump World Tower has 376 units. Designed by the architect Costas Kondylis, the building is high and has 72 constructed floors (but lists 90 stories on elevator panels) with curtain wall facades of dark, bronze-tinted glass.Nash, Eric Peter., and Norman McGrath. Manhattan Skyscrapers. New York: Princeton Architectural, 1999. Print.Robin Pogrebin, High-Rise Architect Sails Proudly in Mainstream, New York Times (February 5, 2007). The resulting large windows allow for extensive views of the East River and Midtown Manhattan. The building is constructed with concrete to improve its wind resistance. In 1961, the 18-story United Engineering Center was built on the site. The Center was demolished to make way for the Trump World Tower. In 1997, Donald Trump and his partners, including the Daewoo Corp., a South Korean chaebol, signed a deal to purchase the site from the United Engineering Trustees for $52 million.Tracie Rozhon, A New Trump Tower Could Overshadow Diplomacy, New York Times (September 12, 1997).

Bagli, Trump Starts A New Tower Near the U.N., New York Times (October 16, 1998). Demolition began in October 1998. Prior to construction, many neighbors, including veteran journalist Walter Cronkite, opposed the building due to its height and lack of distinguishing exterior features; among the concerns was that this tower would dwarf the United Nations Headquarters across the street.Dunford, Martin. The Rough Guide to New York City. New York: Rough Guides, 2009. Print. East Side neighbors who opposed the project raised $400,000 in a bid to defeat it, with investment manager and philanthropist Alberto Vilar contributing $100,000.Blaine Harden, A Bankroll To Fight A Behemoth; Rich Neighbors Open Wallets To Battle Trump's Project For Residential Skyscraper, New York Times (September 8, 1999). Opponents argued that the project would block views, was aesthetically unappealing, violated zoning laws, and was out of character with the surrounding neighborhood.Charles V. Bagli, Opponents of Planned Trump Tower Lose Battle, New York Times (November 22, 2000). The Municipal Art Society also challenged the project on grounds of air pollution. Opponents lost their battle in state court. Construction of the building began in 1999. The construction was financed by two German lenders, Deutsche Bank and Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank. Trump World Tower was briefly the tallest all-residential tower in the world, prior to the completion of the 21st Century Tower in Dubai (2003) and the Tower Palace 3 in Seoul (2004). The tallest of the handful of wholly residential towers completed to date by Donald Trump, it cost approximately US$300 million to construct. The penthouse on the top two floors of the structure which totaled 20,000 square feet (1,858 m¬≤) was priced at $58 million; however, after failing to sell for years, it was split into four different units. Around 2006, Donald Trump was involved in a struggle with the condominium board at the Trump World Tower. Trump requested the assistance of lawyer Michael Cohen, and Trump gained control of the board. Tenants The tower's most expensive floors attracted wealthy buyers from the former Soviet Union. Approximately 65 units were sold to Russian buyers in the late 1990s. New York Yankees star Derek Jeter purchased a 5,425-square-foot condominium for $12.6 million in 2001, and sold it in 2012 for $15.5 million.Elizabeth A.

It is a popular spot among UN diplomats who work nearby. In popular culture The building and some of its condominium units have previously been featured on NBC's The Apprentice, which featured Trump. It has also appeared on the NBC syndicated television show Extra Season 13 - Ep. 193. The building also featured heavily in the 2007 film Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. The main character of Don Delillo's 2003 novel Cosmopolis holds residence in the top three floors of a building that, while unnamed, is described as the tallest residential tower in New York and located at First Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. Media events In 2003, Esquire magazine held a charity event in the \\"Esquire Apartment\\". Besides Trump and his girlfriend (later, wife) Melania, attendees included Uma Thurman, Daniela Pestova, Taye Diggs, and Mark Burnett. Also in 2003, Trump World Tower was the site of the North American \\"sneak preview\\" of the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren supercar, during which singer Beyonc√© Knowles promoted the new luxury vehicle to American media.

Fatu Jr. (born October 11, 1965) is an American professional wrestler, best known under the ring names Rikishi (shortened from Rikishi Phatu) and Fatu with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he is a one- time Intercontinental Champion, two-time World Tag Team Champion, and one-time WWE Tag Team Champion. He is a member of the Anoa ªi family of Samoan wrestlers. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by his sons, wrestlers Jey and Jimmy Uso, in 2015. Early life Fatu was born on October 11, 1965 in San Francisco. He is a member of the famous Anoa ªi family. He attended Balboa High School in San Francisco. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1985‚Äì1992)= The Samoan Swat Team (1985‚Äì1992) Solofa Fatu Jr. started out in 1985 for Gino Brito and Dino Bravo‚Äôs Lutte Internationale promotion in Montreal. There, he worked as Prince Alofa, a high flying babyface. He often teamed with the territory's top faces. His cousin Samula Anoa ªi, was also a wrestler and the two cousins signed with the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico and became The Samoan Swat Team (Samu & Fatu). They used the \\"Samoan savage\\" gimmick their relatives, The Wild Samoans successfully used, working barefoot, never publicly speaking English and no- selling attacks to the head. They became the new WWC Caribbean Tag Team Champions (after a long vacancy) on November 7, 1987, in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico when they beat Invader I and Invader III. They held the title for just over a month before dropping it to Mark and Chris Youngblood before leaving the promotion. Samu and Fatu next appeared in Texas, working for Fritz Von Erich‚Äôs World Class Championship Wrestling. Storywise, Buddy Roberts brought them in to fight his fights against the Von Erich family and former Fabulous Freebirds partner Michael Hayes. The SST was given a big push right away; presented as an unstoppable force, they beat hometown heroes Kerry and Kevin Von Erich for the WCWA World Tag Team Championship on August 12, 1988. They remained undefeated in WCCW until they dropped the belts to Hayes and his new partner, Steve Cox, on September 12. They recaptured the title four days later. Hayes and Cox beat them for the title again on October 15, and, two days later, lost it back again. On September 12, 1988, The Samoan Swat Team became double champions by beating \\"Hollywood\\" John Tatum and Jimmy Jack Funk for the WCWA Texas Tag Team Championship. They made their pay-per-view debut at AWA SuperClash III, the AWA's first and last PPV. They successfully defended their World Tag title against Michael Hayes and Steve Cox. In the beginning of 1989, the SST left WCCW, vacating both championships. Swat Team signed with Jim Crockett Promotions, introduced as manager Paul E. Dangerously's replacement for The Original Midnight Express (Randy Rose and Dennis Condrey), who had left the promotion. The SST took over the Express‚Äô feud with The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane), beating them at Clash of the Champions VI: Ragin' Cajun on April 2, 1989. The SST teamed with former rival Michael Hayes, Terry Gordy, and Jimmy Garvin at the 1989 Great American Bash, losing a WarGames match to The Road Warriors, The Midnight Express, and Steve Williams. In fall 1989, Paul E. Dangerously was phased out and the SST took a new manager, \\"The Big Kahuna\\" Oliver Humperdink. They were also joined by Fatu's brother, The Samoan Savage. The SST lost more and more matches as 1989 drew to a close, but got a break when Sid Vicious was injured, leading his team, The Skyscrapers, to pull out of the \\"Iron Team Tournament\\" at Starrcade 1989. Fatu and The Samoan Savage, rebranded as The New Wild Samoans, replaced them. For the rest of their WCW career, Fatu and Savage teamed, while Samu only wrestled singles matches. After leaving WCW in the summer of 1990, Fatu and Savage worked for several independent promotions in the US, Europe, Puerto Rico and Japan, often teaming with cousin Kokina Maximus. The three worked for the Universal Wrestling Association in 1991, where they won the UWA Trios Tag Team Championship and held it for just under two months. They headlined the UWA's 16th anniversary show, losing the title to Dos Caras, El Canek, and Mil M√°scaras. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1992‚Äì2004)= The Headshrinkers (1992‚Äì1995) After Samu and Fatu joined the World Wrestling Federation, they were renamed The Headshrinkers, but their savage gimmick remained. Kokina Maximus also joined the WWF, but was repackaged as Japanese sumo wrestler Yokozuna, and his relation to The Headshrinkers was not acknowledged. The Headshrinker's first notable angle came when they interfered to help Money Inc. beat The Natural Disasters for the WWF World Tag Team Championship. Soon after, The Headshrinkers feuded with The Natural Disasters and the recently formed High Energy. Between 1992 and early 1994, The Headshrinkers occasionally challenged for the tag title and made sporadic PPV appearances, feuding with The Smoking Gunns and Men on a Mission. Fatu would receive a WWF Championship match against Bret Hart on the March 1, 1993 episode of Monday Night RAW. Despite interference by Samu, Fatu was unsuccessful. The Headshrinkers helped Yokozuna win a casket match against The Undertaker at the 1994 Royal Rumble. In April, they turned face, took Lou Albano as their manager and challenged tag champions The Quebecers. They won the gold on the May 2 episode of Monday Night RAW. At King of the Ring on June 19, they successfully defended the title against Yokozuna and Crush. Their title reign ended at a house show in Indianapolis on August 28, when they lost to Shawn Michaels and Diesel. This happened a day before they were scheduled to defend against Irwin R. Schyster and Bam Bam Bigelow at SummerSlam. The match went on without the title, and The Headshrinkers lost by disqualification. Soon after, Samu left the WWF to recover from injuries and was replaced by Sione (formerly The Barbarian). They were called The New Headshrinkers. The storyline reason for Samu's departure was that he was not coping well with manager Lou Albano's attempts to civilize him, particularly about wearing boots. The New Headshrinkers made only two PPV appearances, at the 1994 Survivor Series, where they were eliminated from their ten-man tag match, but helped their team win and at the 1995 Royal Rumble; Sione lasted about seven minutes early on and Fatu over five nearer the end. They entered a tournament to crown new WWF tag team champions in late 1994/early 1995, and lost to Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka in the semi-finals. For most of 1995, they worked with Jacob & Eli Blu, usually putting them over. Their final match was a loss to Men on a Mission at a June 22 house show in London, England, after which Sione left for WCW. \\"Make a Difference\\" Fatu (1995) Fatu during his \\"Make a Difference\\" gimmick in 1995. Fatu became a singles wrestler in 1995. He was repackaged, dropping the savage gimmick in favor of a more realistic one. He now spoke fluent English and came from San Francisco. He spoke in vignettes of his real-life experience growing up in the ghetto and being hit in a drive-by shooting (which left him clinically dead for three minutes and with a large scar on his abdomen). He often spoke of helping the community, and the gimmick became informally known as \\"Make a Difference\\" Fatu (after his catchphrase/slogan). Two men soon began showing up in the audience whenever Fatu was in the ring: Samu and his brother, Lloyd Anoa ªi, also known as \\"The Samoan Gangster Party\\". The two never got in the ring or confronted Fatu before he was repackaged and the whole angle was dropped. The Sultan (1996‚Äì1998) In 1996, he was repackaged as The Sultan, a masked wrestler who never spoke, ostensibly because his tongue was cut out. He was managed by The Iron Sheik and Bob Backlund. He unsuccessfully challenged Rocky Maivia for the WWF Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania 13. The Sultan vanished in 1998, when Fatu left to train at Dory Funk's Funking Conservatory wrestling school. Too Cool and Intercontinental Champion (1999‚Äì2000) King of the Ring in 2000 After training at Funk's, Fatu returned on the November 13, 1999 episode of WWF Metal as Rikishi Fatu, beating Julio Fantastico. Rikishi is the general Japanese term for a sumo wrestler, similar to his cousin's ring name \\"Yokozuna\\". \\"Fatu\\" soon became \\"Phatu\\", until he dropped the last name entirely after he started teaming with Too Cool. No mention was made of his WWF past. He had gained some weight, bleached his hair blonde, and wore a thong loincloth. Per Vince McMahon's request and Fatu's own willingness to honor sumo tradition, nothing was worn underneath the thong and his buttcheeks were exposed; this was unlike Yokozuna, who wore tights underneath his sumo thong, which both McMahon and Fatu felt were unnecessary for the Yokozuna character. Rikishi briefly feuded with Viscera before forming a wildly popular alliance with the duo Too Cool (Grand Master Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty). One night, during Too Cool's traditional post-match dance routine, Rikishi joined them. As the dance routines became more frequent and longer, this popularity translated to a significant push. In the 2000 Royal Rumble match, he eliminated seven opponents, and it took six wrestlers working together to eliminate him. Rikishi also became known for his infamous signature maneuver ‚Äì the Stink Face ‚Äì as his buttocks were rubbed into the faces of opposing wrestlers. When his opponent was incapacitated in the corner of the ring, Rikishi would slap his buttocks to indicate the attack, and then he would turn around, hike his thong up, and smother his buttocks into his victim's face. This humiliating maneuver became very popular with the fans. In May 2000, fan favorites Rikishi and Too Cool feuded with Edge, Christian and Kurt Angle, culminating in a victory at Judgment Day. After winning the Intercontinental Championship from Chris Benoit on the June 22 episode of SmackDown!, Rikishi qualified for the 2000 King of the Ring tournament. On June 25, at the PPV, he defeated Benoit in the quarterfinals and Val Venis in the semis. Both opponents hit him with a steel chair after losing, weakening his shoulder and helping Kurt Angle defeat him in the final. Stemming from Venis' attack, Rikishi faced him on July 6 and lost the title after Tazz hit him with a television camera. They rematched in a steel cage at Fully Loaded. In this match, Rikishi climbed the cage and, in an allusion to Jimmy Snuka, splashed Venis from the top. Rikishi soon lost the match after Tazz again hit him with a camera. Various storylines (2000‚Äì2001) On October 9, 2000 Commissioner Mick Foley used a slip of the tongue from Scotty 2 Hotty to implicate Rikishi as the person who had run over Steve Austin almost a year earlier at Survivor Series, the night after Rikishi debuted in the WWF. Rikishi admitted it, claiming it was to allow his cousin The Rock an opportunity for stardom, insisting that Buddy Rogers, Bruno Sammartino, Bob Backlund, Hulk Hogan and Austin ‚Äì \\"The Great White Hope\\" ‚Äì had always been pushed, at the expense of Samoan wrestlers like Peter Maivia, Jimmy Snuka, Samu, Yokozuna and The Rock. Rikishi then turned heel. Austin immediately set out for revenge, facing Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match at No Mercy. The match went to a no contest when Austin dragged Rikishi to the parking lot and tried to run him over; a police car drove in front of Austin's, saving Rikishi. Though arrested, Austin had brutally attacked Rikishi, cutting and bruising his face. Later that night, Rikishi interfered in The Rock's WWF Championship defense against Kurt Angle, but \\"accidentally\\" kicked the champ, allowing Angle to Angle Slam them both and win the title. After several attacks on Austin by an unseen assailant, it became clear that Rikishi had an accomplice. During a handicap match pitting Rikishi and Angle against Austin, Triple H came to the ring, seemingly to aid Austin, but swerved the audience by attacking him with a sledgehammer. Triple H then revealed he had masterminded the Survivor Series assault, and hired Rikishi to drive the car. While Austin began feuding with Triple H, Rikishi's tension with The Rock boiled over. Despite delivering a Stink Face to the Rock, Rikishi would lose to him in a match at the 2000 Survivor Series. He then participated in a six- man Hell in a Cell WWF Championship match at Armageddon. Vince McMahon drove a flatbed truck ringside in an effort to dismantle the cage and stop the match. Before he could, The Undertaker chokeslammed Rikishi from the top of the cell onto the wood chip-covered bed. Angle later retained the title. In January 2001, Rikishi won a Fatal Four Way match on SmackDown for the #30 spot in the 2001 Royal Rumble match involving Rock, Undertaker and Kane, after he pinned this latter. There, he eliminated The Undertaker, and was soon eliminated by The Rock. Haku returned to the WWF in the Rumble, and he and Rikishi formed a tag team and feuded with The Brothers of Destruction, The Dudley Boyz then The Hardy Boyz. The team split while Rikishi was sidelined with an eardrum injury in March. He returned on the May 3 SmackDown and fought The Undertaker to no- contest. On the next Raw, he turned face and gave the Stink Face to Stephanie McMahon after she distracted him, and cost him a non-title match with Austin. On May 20, at Judgment Day, he injured his shoulder in the opening bout with William Regal, which caused him to miss much of the year and the entire Invasion angle. Reunion with Scotty 2 Hotty and departure (2001‚Äì2004) Tribute to the Troops in 2003 Rikishi returned on December 6, 2001, delivering a Stink Face to Vince McMahon and solidifying his face status. Upon the WWE Brand Extension, Rikishi was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. At Judgment Day, he faced Billy and Chuck in a \\"secret partner\\" match. His partner turned out to be Rico, Billy and Chuck's stylist. Despite Rico's best efforts to unfairly help Billy and Chuck, Rikishi and Rico won the match and became the WWF Tag Team Champions. Rico would later cause Rikishi to lose the titles back to Billy and Chuck in a rematch on the June 6 episode of SmackDown!. In early 2002, Hulk Hogan was booked to face Rikishi in Hogan's first match back since leaving the WWE to go to rival WCW in the 1990s. Hogan won the match, but Rikishi was able to deliver a Stink Face to Hogan after the conclusion of the match. Rikishi was not featured much in late 2002 and early-2003. He feuded with John Cena, Bill DeMott, and The Full Blooded Italians on SmackDown!. The return of Roddy Piper led Rikishi to challenge him as Piper had hit Jimmy Snuka with a coconut years ago on Piper's Pit. At Backlash, Piper's protege Sean O'Haire defeated Rikishi after Piper got hit with a coconut by Rikishi giving O'Haire time to hit the Widowmaker on Rikishi. Rikishi eventually formed a tag team with Scotty 2 Hotty, and the duo defeated the Basham Brothers for the WWE Tag Team Championship on the February 5, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, holding them for two and a half months before losing them to Charlie Haas and Rico on the April 22 episode of SmackDown!. Fatu, however, was released by WWE on July 16, 2004, following repeated requests from WWE to lose weight. =Independent circuit (2005‚Äì2019)= Rikishi in 2011 Fatu continued to wrestle on the independent circuit. In October 2005, he shortened his ring name to Kishi after being notified by WWE legal representatives that WWE owned a trademark on the name \\"Rikishi\\". Fatu, as Kishi, would go on to work for Nu-Wrestling Evolution, a professional wrestling promotion based in Italy. On February 17, 2007, Fatu competed as SUMO RIKISHI in a tag team contest at an All Japan Pro Wrestling event, as he was brought in by Keiji Mutoh to feud with Akebono. On August 12, 2007, Fatu competed in an 8-man tag, as Rikishi, at AAA's TripleMania event. On August 23, Fatu competed in a Triple Threat match against Samoa Joe and Sterling James Keenan at Ballpark Brawl VIII in Buffalo, New York. On November 17, wrestling as Rikishi once again, Fatu defeated Mike Rollins at a Heavy on Wrestling event in Duluth, Minnesota. = Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007) = On the September 13, 2007 episode of Impact!, Fatu debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling under the ring name Junior Fatu. on the September 20 episode of Impact, Fatu lost to Christian Cage in his first match due to a distraction by Christian's partner A.J. Styles. On the October 4 episode of Impact!, Fatu, Samoa Joe and The Latin American Xchange defeated Christian, Styles, Senshi and Christopher Daniels. on the October 11 episode of Impact!, Fatu and LAX lost a six-man tag team match to Kurt Angle and Team 3D. At Bound for Glory 2007, Fatu competed in the Fight for the Right Reverse Battle Royal which was won by Eric Young. On the October 25 episode of Impact!, Fatu defeated Robert Roode in a Fight for the Right Tournament match after interference by Samoa Joe. On October 30, however, it was reported that Fatu had been released from TNA, due to he and TNA management failing to reach an agreement about a pay raise. Chris Harris took Fatu's spot in the Fight for the Right semi-final match. = Sporadic WWE appearances and Hall of Famer (2012‚Äì2015, 2019)= Rikishi (far left), as one of Heath Slater's veteran conquerors at Raw 1000 Rikishi appeared with his family at the 2012 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to induct his cousin Yokozuna. He then made an in-ring appearance on Raw on July 16, 2012, defeating Heath Slater. During the match, he used the Samoan Spike and the Banzai Drop (the latter having been used as a finishing move since his 1999 repackaging as Rikishi) as a tribute to his deceased brother Umaga and cousin Yokozuna, respectively. After the match, he danced with his sons Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso. He then reappeared on the 1,000th episode on July 23 with other Legends to help Lita take down Slater. Rikishi next appeared on the January 6, 2014 episode of Raw, where he reunited with Too Cool to defeat 3MB in a six-man tag team match. On the February 9, 2015 episode of Raw, Rikishi was announced as the newest member to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2015.

He held the WWA World Heavyweight Championship once in World Wrestling All-Stars, and aligned himself with The Undertaker in World Wrestling Entertainment on its SmackDown brand. Early life Jones was born in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Before his career as a wrestler, Jones was sentenced to 16 years in 1987 at the age of 20 to Boggo Road Gaol for eight armed robberies between 1985‚Äì1987, two of which occurred in Tasmania. During the robberies, he became one of Australia's most wanted and ended up serving seven years in a maximum-security prison. In 1994, Jones was given one year work release before being discharged at the age of 25. While in prison, he was introduced to the sport of powerlifting. He is also alleged to have begun taking steroids during this time. Within a short space of time, he became the National Powerlifting Champion of Australia. Strongman career Upon his release, Jones also began competing in strongman contests and during this time, he was dubbed \\"Megaman\\". As the reigning Australia's Strongest Man, he entered the World Strength Championship at Callander, Scotland on 29‚Äì30 July 1995. He took first place, topping a field that included 1993 World's Strongest Man Gary Taylor. The following weekend, he competed in the World Muscle Power Classic held at Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. That contest was won by Magn√∫s Ver Magn√∫sson, with Nathan finishing fifth in a field of twelve competitors.Milo, October 1995, pp. 37‚Äì42 Jones next took part in the 1995 World's Strongest Man contest. After quickly defeating Phil Martin twice in the arm wrestling event in the qualifying heat, Jones was then matched against Magnus Samuelsson, who had been Europe's arm wrestling champion for several years and who would become the World's Strongest Man in 1998. Samuelsson won the first round. In the second round Jones refused to go down and pulled with his opposite arm, twisting his body. This resulted in breaking the arm he was using to wrestle (a spiral fracture of the humerus),Milo January 1996, pp. 41‚Äì46 and he subsequently was out of the competition. Jones returned to Strongman competition in 1996 winning the World Strongman Challenge, and placed third in a World's Strongest Man qualifying heat behind Magn√∫s Ver Magn√∫sson and Jorma Ojanaho.World's Strongest Man competition page. Strongestman.billhenderson.org. Retrieved on 23 October 2011. Mixed martial arts career He also participated in a mixed martial arts match at KRS- Pride's debut event Pride 1 in October 1997, facing Japanese professional wrestler and former grand sumo champion Koji Kitao. Jones lost after being caught in an americana, a type of bent armlock. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1997‚Äì2001)= =World Wrestling All-Stars (2001‚Äì2002)= After working as a bodyguard for multimillionaire Rene Rivkin, Jones began a career in wrestling during this time. Jones first gained fame working in World Wrestling All-Stars, making a large impression at the first WWA pay-per-view \\"Inception\\", where he was accompanied to the ring by Rove McManus. However he was defeated after Rove was smashed with Jeff Jarrett's guitar and Jones was hit with the Stroke. During his time in the WWA, Nathan won the WWA World Heavyweight Championship on 7 April 2002 before losing the belt to Scott Steiner only 5 days later. =Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max (2002)= After the title loss, Jones began performing for Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max in June. On 20 October, Jones and Jon Heidenreich defeated Masato Tanaka and Shinjiro Otani to win the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. On 25 October, Jones and Heidenreich successfully retained the title against Jimmy Snuka Jr. and The Predator before losing the title the next day to Naoya Ogawa and Shinya Hashimoto. =World Wrestling Entertainment (2002‚Äì2003)= After Jones initially signed his contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), he was unable to work in the United States because of visa issues stemming from his criminal history. In late 2002 and early 2003, Jones began performing in dark matches for World Wrestling Entertainment. He was originally promoted as a \\"Hannibal Lecter\\" type character. On 10 April 2003 episode of SmackDown!, Jones made his televised WWE in-ring debut and defeated Bill DeMott. Upon debuting, Jones' original character was nixed, and he was put into a storyline with The Undertaker as his prot√©g√© and helper during Undertaker's feud with A-Train and The Big Show. At WrestleMania XIX, Jones and Undertaker were scheduled to face Big Show and A-Train in a tag team match, but at the last minute, the match was made a handicap match instead. On screen, Jones was attacked pre-match and left injured. Near the closing moments of the match, Jones reappeared and attacked Big Show, enabling Undertaker to pin A-Train for the victory. Jones was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling to improve his skills. Jones was then absent from television for several months until returning in the fall of 2003 as a villain known by the nickname \\"The Colossus of Boggo Road\\", a title referring to his time spent in Boggo Road Gaol. He was paired with Paul Heyman on-screen and Heyman was given the role as Smackdown General Manager. He was also immediately placed into Brock Lesnar's Survivor Series team, which also included A-Train, Big Show, and Matt Morgan in order to compete against Lesnar's rival Kurt Angle and his team. At Survivor Series, Jones was eliminated by Angle after he submitted to the Ankle lock. Team Lesnar was defeated by Team Angle and Jones was then relegated to interfere in Lesnar's matches along with the other members of Team Lesnar. He was also placed in matches by either Lesnar or Heyman to aid them. On 6 December 2003, Jones quit the company due to the rigor of WWE's heavy travel schedules while on tour in Perth, Australia. =Post-WWE and retirement= After leaving WWE, Jones was scheduled to make his pro wrestling return in 2004 at the Australian Wrestling Supershow III, booked against Mark Mercedes. Jones did not appear as advertised and a battle royal was held following an angry shoot promo on Jones by Mercedes and promoter Andy Raymond. In 2005, he wrestled three matches for World Series Wrestling. On 5 October, he defeated Lee Star and on 7 and 8 October, he defeated Mark Hilton. After his last match with Hilton, Jones immediately retired from wrestling. In 2008, Jones signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, but nerve damage caused by a cement truck hitting his left arm kept him sidelined for the first three months. He never wrestled for the promotion.

Built in 1977 to house the headquarters of Citibank, it is tall and has 59 floors with of office space. The building has a 45¬∞ angled top and a stilt-style base. It was designed by architect Hugh Stubbins and structural engineer William LeMessurier. The building is currently owned by Boston Properties, and in 2009, was renamed 601 Lexington Avenue. In 2016, it was made a New York City designated landmark. Design Top of the Citigroup Center from the Rockefeller Center The Citigroup Center is a 59-story, tower clad in glass and metal facade. Structural engineer William LeMessurier designed the tower to be supported by four massive columns 114 feet (35 meters) high, positioned at the center of each side, rather than at the corners. This design allowed the corners of the building to cantilever 72 feet (22 meters). To help accomplish this, LeMessurier employed a system of stacked load-bearing braces, in the form of inverted chevrons. Each chevron is designed to distribute tension loads (due to wind) to their center, then downward into the ground through the uniquely positioned columns. The roof of Citigroup Center slopes at a 45-degree angle. Designers originally intended it to be terraces for apartments, and later revised it to contain flat-plate solar collectors, to produce hot water which would be used to dehumidify air and reduce cooling energy. However, they eventually dropped this idea because the positioning of the angled roof meant that the solar panels would not face the sun directly. =Notable features= Base of the Citigroup Center. St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church is visible on the left-hand-side below the skyscraper, the location of which necessitated the unusual column locations. The cantilever exists because the northwest corner of the building site is occupied by St. Peter's Lutheran Church. When Citicorp Center was built in the 1970s, the church allowed Citicorp to demolish the old church building and build the skyscraper under one condition: a new church would have to be built on the same corner, not attached to the Citicorp building and no columns passing through it, because the church wanted to remain on the site of the new development, near one of the intersections. The church, at 619 Lexington Avenue with its entrance from 54th Street, has a theatre in its basement which is mainly used by the York Theatre.Our Venue, York Theatre To help stabilize the building, a tuned mass damper was placed in the mechanical space at its top. This substantial piece of stabilizing equipment weighs 400 tons (350 metric tons). The damper is designed to counteract swaying motions due to the effect of wind on the building and reduces the building's movement due to wind by as much as 50%. Citigroup Center was the first skyscraper in the United States to feature a tuned mass damper. In addition, in 2002, one of the columns was reinforced with blast-resistant shields of steel and copper as well as steel bracing to protect the building due to the possibility of a terrorist attack. The building features double-deck elevators, which are separated to serve only odd or even floors. People can travel between odd and even floors using escalators. Various plazas were included as part of the building's construction. One such plaza exists below the cantilever, where there is an entrance to the New York City Subway station at Lexington Avenue/51st Street, served by the . From 1987 to 2009, the bank presented an annual toy train exhibition in the lower lobby.Citi Derails Holiday Toy-Train Show in Credit Crunch Bloomberg News, December 9, 2008 History =Site= Public lobby The northwest corner of the site was originally occupied by St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church, which was founded in 1862 (as the Deutsche Evangelische Lutherische Sanct Petri-Kirche). The original church building was sold and demolished to construct the Grand Central Terminal in 1903. In 1905, the church moved to the location of 54th Street and Lexington Avenue, where it remained until the building was purchased by First National City Bank (later known as Citibank) in 1970. =Engineering crisis of 1978= View from the street Due to a design oversight and changes during construction, the building as initially completed was structurally unsound. For his original design, LeMessurier calculated wind load on the building when wind blew perpendicularly against the side of the building‚Äîwind from due north, east, south, or west‚Äîall that was required by New York building code. Such winds are normally the worst case, and a structural system capable of handling them can easily cope with wind from any other angle. Thus, the engineer did not specifically calculate the effects of diagonally-oriented \\"quartering winds\\" (northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest). In June 1978, prompted by discussion between a civil engineering student at Princeton University, Diane Hartley, and design engineer Joel Weinstein, LeMessurier recalculated the wind loads on the building, this time including quartering winds. This recalculation revealed that with a quartering wind, there was a 40% increase in wind loads, resulting in a 160% increase in the load at the chevron brace connection joints. LeMessurier's original design for the chevron load braces used welded joints. However, during construction, builder Bethlehem Steel was approved to use bolted joints to save labor and material costs. LeMessurier's firm approved the change, although this was not known to LeMessurier himself. The original welded-joint design had ample strength to withstand the load from straight-on wind, with enough safety margin to withstand the higher loads from quartering wind; however, the load from a hurricane force quartering wind would exceed the strength of the bolted-joint chevrons. The bolts could shear and the building could collapse. Wind tunnel tests with models of Citigroup Center revealed that the wind speed required to bring down the building would occur every 16 years on average. For occupant comfort, the building has a tuned mass damper, which also negates much of the wind load. The damper is electrically activated, so if power failed, for example during a hurricane, the damper might not turn on, and a much lower- speed wind would suffice; wind of this speed occurs on average once in 16 years. LeMessurier also discovered that his firm had used New York City's truss safety factor of 1:1 instead of the column safety factor of 1:2. These factors, combined, put the building in critical danger. The problems were discovered in June, the beginning of hurricane season, and had to be corrected quickly. LeMessurier reportedly agonized over how to deal with the problem. If the issues were made known to the public, he risked ruining his professional reputation. He approached the architect (Hugh Stubbins) first, and then Citicorp. He advised them to take swift remedial action. Ultimately, he persuaded Citicorp to repair the building without informing the public, a task made easier by a then-ongoing press strike. For the next three months, construction crews working at night welded 2\\" steel plates over each of the skyscraper's 200 bolted joints. They worked during the night, after each work day, almost unknown to the general public. Six weeks into the work, a major storm (Hurricane Ella) was off Cape Hatteras and heading for New York. With New York City hours away from emergency evacuation, the reinforcement was only half-finished. Ella eventually turned eastward and veered out to sea, buying enough time for workers to permanently correct the problem. As a precaution, Citicorp did work out emergency evacuation plans with local officials for the immediate neighborhood. Because nothing happened as a result of the engineering gaffe, the danger was kept hidden from the public for almost 20 years. It was publicized in a lengthy article in The New Yorker in 1995.Joseph Morgenstern (1995), \\"The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis\\", The New Yorker, May 29, 1995. Pages 45‚Äì53.  Ethical questions  Night view of the Citigroup Center from alt= Architect Eugene Kremer has discussed the ethical questions raised in this case.Eugene Kremer (2002). \\"(Re)Examining the Citicorp Case: Ethical Paragon or Chimera\\", Cross Currents, Fall 2002, Vol. 52, No 3. LeMessurier was criticized for insufficient oversight leading to bolted rather than welded joints, for not informing the endangered neighbors, for actively misleading the public about the extent of the danger during the reinforcement process, and for not informing architects or other structural engineers about the problem and solution for two decades. However, his act of alerting Citicorp to the problem in his design is now used as an example of ethical behavior in several engineering textbooks. Kremer discusses six key points: # Analysis of wind loads. Check all calculations and not rely just on building codes; these set minimum requirements and not the state of the art. # Design changes. In this case change from welded to bolted connections. Changes are considered in the overall design context and by everyone involved and not a spur of the moment decision. # Professional responsibility. To follow the codes of conduct for every chartered institution. LeMessurier did not consider the public safety first. # Public statements. In this case the public statements issued by LeMessurier and Citigroup set out to mislead the public deliberately. # Public safety. The public statement denied the public the right to ensure their own safety and to make their own critical decisions. # Advancement of professional knowledge. Concealing this problem for almost 20 years prevented ethical and engineering learning that could have taken place. = Sale and name/address changes = Former Citicorp Chairman Walter B. Wriston was reportedly behind the decision to acquire several low- and mid- rise buildings in the area, supposedly to buy out massage parlors and mom-and- pop stores in Midtown. In 1987, Citigroup sold two-thirds of its interest in the building, along with one-third of its interest in 399 Park Avenue, to Dai- Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company for $670 million (total cost of building adjusted for inflation: $). In 2001, Citicorp sold its controlling stake in the building for $755 million (cost of building adjusted for inflation: $) to Boston Properties. Citigroup relocated its headquarters to 399 Park Avenue.

History It is possible that nagamaki were first produced during the Heian period (794 to 1185) but there are no known examples dating from before the mid Kamakura period (1192‚Äì1333).The Connoisseur's Book of Japanese Swords, Author K≈çkan Nagayama, Publisher Kodansha International, 1997, , P.23 During the middle of the Muromachi period (1336‚Äì1573) the nagamaki reached its peak of usage. The famed warlord Uesugi Kenshin, daimy≈ç of Echigo Province, is said to have had a special guard of retainers armed with nagamaki.Amdur 2002, p. 117. Description The nagamaki was a long sword with a blade that could be 2 feet or more and a handle of about equal length to the blade. The blade was single-edged and it could resemble a naginata blade, but the main difference in how the blades were mounted was that the handle (tsuka) of the nagamaki was not a simple wooden shaft as in the naginata; it was made more like a katana hilt. Even the name \\"nagamaki\\" (\\"long wrapping\\") is given by the tradition of handle wrapping. The nagamaki's handle was wrapped with leather or silk cords in criss-crossed manner, very similar to that of a katana's. The nagamaki is considered to be evolved from the extremely long ≈çdachi or nodachi swords that are described in fourteenth century literature and pictorial sources. The length of blade varies on a nagamaki. However, the nagasa (blade length) most commonly fits the profile of a tachi or katana blade, which would be a blade of more than 2 shaku (2 Shaku = 60.6 cm, roughly 2 feet) in length. While nagamaki means \\"long wrap\\", there have been specimens found with no wrapping cord at all, which is very much like a long tachi handle. The tsukamaki (hilt wrap) is of even more importance when applied to the hilt. The cord helps to improve grip on the hilt and also lends structural integrity to the wooden handle. Nagamaki found without hilt wraps usually had at least metal collars around the hilt where the tang is. There are no solid rules governing the aspects of the make of the nagamaki. Unlike wakizashi, tant≈ç, and katana, which have had history of strict measurements regarding the blade length and even the hilt in some cases; the nagamaki varied in blade length, tang length, kissaki style, etc. Nagamaki presumably could have koshirae in a tachi or katana style as well as a nagamaki style, however there are examples of nagamaki with rather long tangs, which could be fitted with a longer staff for a haft and effectively function as a naginata. Araki-ry≈´ nagamaki is a heavy naginata over eight pounds of weight and eight feet long.Amdur 2002, p. 121. All traditional Japanese swords are fitted very snugly to their hilts and held in place with a mekugi, a bamboo peg which is fit through a hole in the tang called a mekugi-ana. This is actually quite a strong mount when done correctly, and allowed for easy dismount of the bare blade for maintenance or inspection. Katana most commonly had one single pin, and nagamaki commonly have been found with two or more to account for the added leverage of a longer handle. Use Wielding is very specific; it is held with two hands in a fixed position in the same way a katana is held. Unlike the naginata, the hands do not change when handling the weapon and the right hand was always the closest to the blade. While handling nagamaki fewer sliding actions on the handle are performed than are with the naginata, where the entire length of the shaft is used. The nagamaki is designed for large sweeping and slicing strokes.Amdur 2002, p. 120. Traditionally the nagamaki was used as an infantry weapon, frequently used against cavalry. In fiction *Sir Alonne, a boss encountered in the Dark Souls II DLC campaign Crown of the Iron King, is a samurai-esque character who wields a nagamaki. He will commit seppuku with the nagamaki should the player defeat him under 5 minutes without taking damage. *Lyon, a supporting character in the fifth Suikoden game, wields a nagamaki to protect her charge, the Prince of Falena, who is the protagonist. *In The Lord of the Rings films The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, the Elves are shown using a curved, single-edged sword very similar to the nagamaki, except for a subtle S-shape. *Corrupted monk, a boss encountered in the game Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice wields a huge nagamaki and performs elaborate swipe and swing attacks on the player. *In Samurai Shodown (2019), newcomer Yashamaru Kurama wields a nagamaki; currently the only character in the series to wield one.

Other names for this type of study include \\"between patient\\" and \\"non-crossover\\". This is unlike a crossover study where at first one group receives treatment A and later followed by treatment B while the other group receives treatment B followed by treatment A. There are, however, certain characteristics that allow for differentiation between these two types of trials. For example, a parallel study would be more appropriate if any concerns about carryover effects were present. This type of study might also be more beneficial if the disease or disorder being studied has a likely chance of progression during the time in which the study takes place. One significant issue with parallel studies, though, is the concept of intra subject variability, which is defined as variability in response occurring within the same patient. The two treatment groups in a parallel study can either consist of two completely separate treatments (i.e. different drugs), or simply different doses of a common drug. One major aspect of a parallel study is randomization ‚Äì this ensures that the results are accurate and have a lower risk of being biased. Control groups utilizing a placebo, or active control, are often used in this type of study.

He later moved to Olympia, Washington where he attended North Thurston High School in Lacey, Washington. During his senior year, he worked as a dishwasher at Dirty Dave's Pizza Parlor while saving money to attend wrestling school. While growing up, Kendrick's favorite wrestlers included Ultimate Warrior, Blue Blazer and Koko B. Ware. He was also a fan of Shawn Michaels, who trained him, and Chris Jericho. He was already very good friends with his former tag team partner Paul London, with Lance Cade and Bryan Danielson, both of whom he trained with. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1999‚Äì2002)= In 1999, he moved to Texas to begin training at the NWA Southwest wrestling school and later attended the Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy. It was there that Kendrick adopted the ring name Spanky, a nickname he was given due to his method of staying awake during long drives on the indy circuit. He made his professional wrestling debut on October 8, 1999 in a match with American Dragon that ended in a 10-minute time limit draw. In October 2001, Kendrick wrestled American Dragon in the first round of The King of the Indies tournament, but lost. The crowd, however, gave both men a standing ovation after the match. =World Wrestling Federation (2000-2001)= Memphis Championship Wrestling (2000‚Äì2001) In February 2000, Kendrick signed a developmental deal with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), spending a year in the company's \\"farm territory\\", Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW), before the promotion closed and Kendrick was released from his contract. Kendrick won his first Championship in MCW when he defeated American Dragon for the MCW Southern Light Heavyweight Championship on September 22. He later teamed with American Dragon to win the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship, on December 1, becoming a double champion. The tag team disbanded after they lost the Championships to The Dupps.

On June 1, however, Spanky was stripped of the title and it was abandoned, making Spanky the last ever MCW Southern Light Heavyweight Champion. He also holds the record for most reigns, with three. =Ring of Honor (2002)= On February 23, 2002, Kendrick wrestled on the premiere show of Ring of Honor (ROH), winning the match to gain an ROH contract. While in ROH, Kendrick competed in several other promotions such as Heartland Wrestling Association and All Pro Wrestling, before leaving for Japan in June to compete in Pro Wrestling Zero- One (Zero-One). There, he wrestled under the ring name Leonardo Spanky, a gimmick proposed by Shinya Hashimoto due to Kendrick's resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio. On June 29, he became the first International Junior Heavyweight Champion in company history. He dropped the title to Low Ki a few months later. =World Wrestling Entertainment (2002‚Äì2004)= In late 2002, Kendrick signed a contract with WWE but was unable to compete until he completed his time in the independent circuit. He made his WWE debut on the edition of January 11, 2003 of Velocity under the gimmick of a mascot representing the local sports team of the town in which he was competing. He continued wearing masks for several weeks, each time competing under a different identity. After acting as a telegram deliverer for Big Show to Undertaker, and getting a Last Ride for his troubles, he showed up the following week and began a series of events trying to impress the then General Manager of Smackdown! Stephanie McMahon in order to earn a contract for the WWE, including trying to last five minutes in a match with Kurt Angle. He eventually earned himself a contract on the March 20, 2003 episode of Smackdown! by defeating Shannon Moore. His first major storyline within WWE came on the May 1, 2003 episode of SmackDown!. He reverted to his former \\"Spanky\\" ring name after he interrupted a promo by John Cena. The two feuded over their similar hip hop gimmicks, until May 22. On October 30, Spanky began teaming with Paul London until January 13, 2004 when Kendrick left WWE to return to Zero1. =Independent circuit (2004‚Äì2005)= After leaving WWE, Kendrick wrestled in different independent promotions. He returned to Pro Wrestling Zero1 as \\"Spanky\\" and was quickly pushed to capture the NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Championship. This occurred with partner Low Ki on February 19, 2004, when they defeated Dick Togo and Ikuto Hidaka. They lost the championship to Tatsuhito Takaiwa and Tomohiro Ishii a few months later. Kendrick gained a new tag team partner in Kaz Hayashi, on September 19, 2004, and won back the championships.

On February 25, Kendrick wrestled a match against fellow WWE alumnus, James Gibson. Throughout the match, the crowd chanted \\"Welcome Back!\\" and \\"SmackDown! Sucks!\\", and both men received a standing ovation after the match. During his time in ROH, Kendrick was booked as a mid-carder, consistently having matches late on the card. Kendrick also competed in the Trios Tournament, but lost in the first round with his team members, Gibson and Nigel McGuinness. He unsuccessfully competed for several titles such as the ROH Pure Championship, ROH World Championship and ROH World Tag Team Championship. In July 2005, Kendrick announced that he had re-signed with World Wrestling Entertainment, and would be returning there after he had fulfilled his obligations on the Independent circuit. In FIP, Kendrick won the FIP Tag Team Championship with Sal Rinauro on August 6, 2005, but lost it to The Heartbreak Express less than a month later, shortly before he returned to WWE. =Return to WWE= Teaming with Paul London (2005‚Äì2008) In July 2005, Kendrick announced that after he had fulfilled his obligations on the independent circuit, he would return to WWE. He made his return during a live event on August 22, 2005, losing in a Fatal Four-Way match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. He then reformed a tag team with his former partner Paul London on the edition of September 30 of Velocity. On December 16, the pair remade their image, wearing theatrical masks to the ring with matching vests and shorts. They were quickly elevated into the WWE Tag Team Championship picture, receiving a non-title match against WWE Tag Team Champions MNM on the edition of February 10, 2006 of SmackDown!, which London and Kendrick lost. On April 7, they faced MNM again, picking up a win in a non-title match. Their storyline feud continued, as London and Kendrick continued their winning streak over the champions, including singles victories for both Kendrick and London on MNM members Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury, respectively. London and Kendrick won the WWE Tag Team Championship at Judgment Day, thus defeating MNM six times in a row in singles and tag team matches altogether. WWE Tag Team Champion in December 2006 Their first main competition for the titles came when K. C. James and Idol Stevens defeated the champions in a non-title match, in early August, igniting a storyline feud between the two teams. During the rivalry, WWE Diva Ashley Massaro began accompanying London and Kendrick to the ring, acting as a valet to the team while combating the actions of James and Stevens' manager Michelle McCool. On October 14, London and Kendrick became the longest reigning WWE Tag Team Champions until 2016, surpassing MNM's previous record of 145 days. Despite this, they were still booked as the underdogs in their feuds, and this was shown when they began a losing streak to the team of William Regal and Dave Taylor. Regal defeated both in singles matches and on the December 8 episode of SmackDown!, Kendrick and London lost a non-title tag team match to the duo. London and Kendrick had a scheduled title defense at Armageddon, against Regal and Taylor. Before the pay-per-view, the match changed into a Fatal Four Way tag team ladder match with London and Kendrick defending their titles against Regal and Taylor, MNM, and The Hardys. London and Kendrick won the match and retained the titles. Snitsky during 2007 On February 2, 2007, London and Kendrick suffered a non-title loss to the rookie team Deuce 'n Domino. In a title match at No Way Out, London and Kendrick retained the championship. London and Kendrick, however, dropped the championship to them on the edition of April 20 of SmackDown!, ending their reign at 331 days (SmackDown! was recorded on April 17). In the storyline, London missed a moonsault from the ring apron to the floor during the title match, injuring his ribs, leaving Kendrick to battle Deuce 'n Domino alone. London and Kendrick unsuccessfully competed for the title on June 1 in a triple threat tag team match, which also involved Regal and Taylor, and lost a rematch on June 15 in a standard tag team match. Kendrick, along with London, was drafted to the Raw brand on June 17, 2007 during the Supplemental Draft. They won their debut match on Raw against The World's Greatest Tag Team on June 18. They were soon established as a threat to the tag titles, and on the edition of September 3 of Raw, they won a number one contender's match for Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch's World Tag Team Championship. Kendrick and London then worked a feud with Cade and Murdoch, and at a house show on September 5, they defeated Cade and Murdoch to win the titles, only to lose it back to Cade and Murdoch three days later. London and Kendrick continued to feud with Cade and Murdoch and lost to the Tag Team champions at Unforgiven. For the rest of 2007, London and Kendrick mainly competed on Heat or in tag title bouts, until London got injured in late 2007. As a result, Kendrick was mainly used as a jobber on Raw, until London returned at the start of February 2008, although Kendrick still won sometimes on Heat. In his next storyline, Kendrick abandoned London during a handicap match with Umaga. This abandonment resulted in Umaga performing the Samoan Spike on London, allowing Umaga to pick up the win over the duo. London and Kendrick still teamed together with no apparent dissension rising between the former tag team champions. After defeating Charlie Haas and Robbie McAllister on Heat, London and Kendrick said they were ready to win the World Tag Team Championship. London and Kendrick beat the champions Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes next week on Heat in a non-title match. However, they failed to win the World Tag Team Titles on Raw after Holly pinned London.

He later teamed with Jackson on many occasions, becoming number one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship held by Carlito and Primo, but they never managed to win the championship. On April 15, 2009, Kendrick was separated from Jackson as he was drafted back to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft while Jackson was drafted to the ECW brand.

John Tenniel's illustration from the 1884 edition of Aesop's fables The absent- minded professor is a stock character of popular fiction, usually portrayed as a talented academic whose academic brilliance is accompanied by below-par functioning in other areas, leading to forgetfulness and mistakes. One explanation of this is that highly talented individuals often have unevenly distributed capabilities, being brilliant in their field of choice but below average on other measures of ability. Alternatively, they are considered to be so engrossed in their field of study that they forget their surroundings. The phrase \\"absent-minded professor\\" is also commonly used more generally in English to describe people who are so engrossed in their \\"own world\\" that they fail to keep track of their surroundings. It is a common stereotype that professors get so obsessed with their research that they pay little attention to anything else. The stereotype is very old: the ancient Greek biographer Diogenes La√´rtius wrote that the philosopher Thales walked at night with his eyes focused on the heavens and, as a result, fell down a well.Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, \\"Thales\\" Examples of real scholars Isaac Newton,, p.ix Adam Smith, Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re, Jacques Hadamard, Sewall Wright, Nikola Tesla, Norbert Wiener, Archimedes, Pierre Curie, p.76 and Albert Einstein were all scholars considered to be absent- minded - their attention absorbed by their academic studies. William Archibald Spooner, who gave his name to the spoonerism, was known for his absent- mindedness and eccentricity. Fictitious examples A disheveled, distracted professor. \\"Doc\\" Emmett Brown from Back to the Future is an example of an absent-minded scientist-inventor character. He is depicted as strange, eccentric, or insane. Another example is the title character in the film The Absent-Minded Professor and its less successful film remakes, all based on the short story \\"A Situation of Gravity\\" by Samuel W. Taylor. Examples in television include Professor Farnsworth in Futurama, Professor Frink in The Simpsons, Walter Bishop in the Fox television series Fringe, and Professor Von Schlemmer in Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. Multo, one of the characters in the children's series The Zula Patrol, is another example of an absent-minded professor. Professor Kokintz in The Mouse That Roared by Leonard Wibberley is an example from literature. Professor Branestawm, created in the 1930s by Norman Hunter, is an earlier example of the archetype, and Jacques Paganel from the Jules Verne's 1867 novel In Search of the Castaways is probably the codifier of the archetype in the modern literature. Professor Caractacus Potts in the story of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang qualifies as an absent-minded inventor. Comic strip examples include Professor Calculus in The Adventures of Tintin; Eli Eon in Little Orphan Annie; and Professor Edgewise, a minor recurring character in Marvel Family stories. Isaac Kleiner from the Half-Life saga, Professor E. Gadd from the Luigi's Mansion series and Professor Harold MacDougal from Red Dead Redemption are examples in videogames. The archetype is sometimes mixed with that of the mad scientist, often for comic effect, as in the Jerry Lewis film The Nutty Professor or the Profesor Bacterio in the Mortadelo y Filem√≥n comics and movies. However, the mad scientist archetype usually has malevolent connotations, while the absent-minded professor is typically characterized as benevolent. The fictional absent-minded professor is often a college professor of science or engineering; in the fantasy genre, a similar character may appear as a wizard. Examples of this include the characterisation of Merlin in The Sword in the Stone (particularly in the Disney adaptation) and Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series.

He is best known for his appearances in World Wrestling Entertainment and current work for Ultimate Pro Wrestling as a part-time trainer for the wrestlers, as well as working in the independents as Ryan Sakoda. Professional wrestling career Before coming to WWE, Sakoda had a successful stint in the NWA Zero-One promotion in Japan, stemming from his appearances for Ultimate Pro Wrestling. During this time Sakoda often filled in as an instructor at UPW's Ultimate University, while wrestling as part of the faction Team Emblem with Japanese superstars Masato Tanaka and Shinjiro Otani. In September 2003, Sakoda was signed to a developmental contract, it wouldn't be long before Sakoda was brought up to SmackDown!'s main roster. He along with Akio made their WWE debuts on October 19, 2003, at No Mercy. Sakoda aligned himself with Akio, forming the heel tag team Kyo Dai, the Yakuza-style henchmen of Tajiri. In August 2004, Sakoda was released from his WWE contract. Sakoda returned to UPW in March 2005 as a part-time trainer and part-time auto sales executive at Worthington Ford. He made his return to full-time in-ring competition in 2007 with MTV's Wrestling Society X. He is currently wrestling as an independent in the local circuit. Sakoda filed a class action lawsuit against WWE, alleging that wrestlers suffered traumatic brain injuries while wrestling for them and that the company tried to conceal that information. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. In March 2016, the suit was dismissed by Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant.

It is located in Miramar, San Diego, California, about north of Downtown San Diego. The airfield is named Foss Field after Joe Foss. The air station is the former location of Pacific Fleet fighter and Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft (F-4 Phantom II, F-14 Tomcat, E-2 Hawkeye) and is best known as the former location of the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School (NFWS), its TOPGUN training program and the movie of the same name. In 1996, NFWS was relocated to Naval Air Station Fallon in western Nevada and merged into the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC). During the heyday of TOPGUN at NAS Miramar, the station was nicknamed \\"Fightertown USA\\". Geography Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar The base contains . It is bisected by Kearny Villa Road and Interstate 15. The area east of Kearny Villa Road, called \\"East Miramar\\", is undeveloped and is used for military training. History Kumeyaay Native Americans were the first inhabitants in the vicinity of the base. Spain claimed the San Diego area in 1542 and colonized it beginning in 1769. In 1846 the crown issued a land grant that included the area of the current base to Don Santiago Arg√ºello. After the American Civil War, the land was divided and sold to people such as Edward Scripps, a newspaper publisher from the eastern United States, who developed a ranch on the site. It was Scripps who named the area Miramar, meaning \\"view of the sea\\".Fetzer, Leland, San Diego County Place Names A to Z, page 93, Sunbelt Publications, Inc, 2005, The land was predominantly used for grazing and farming into the early 20th century. =1918‚Äì1941= During World War I, the U.S. Army acquired of land in the Miramar Ranch area, on a mesa north of San Diego.Shettle, M.L., Jr., Naval Air Station Miramar, at militarymuseum.org Camp Kearny was opened on 18 January 1917 and was named after Stephen W. Kearny, who was commander of the Army of the West during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The base was primarily used to train infantrymen on their way to the battlefields of Europe. During World War I an airstrip was never built on the property, although Army and Navy aircraft from Naval Air Station North Island did land on the parade deck. Following the Armistice, the base was used to demobilize servicemen and was closed on 20 October 1920. More than 1,200 buildings were demolished when the camp closed. Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis airplane was built in nearby San Diego. Lindbergh used the abandoned Camp Kearny parade field to practice landings and take-offs before making his historic solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean. During the 1930s, the Navy briefly used the air base for helium dirigibles. In 1932 a mooring mast and hangar were built at the camp for the dirigibles, but when the program was abandoned, the base was quiet again. =World War II= By the time World War II began, Miramar was already undergoing a ‚Äúprecautionary‚Äù renovation. Camp Holcomb (later renamed Camp Elliott) was built on part of old Camp Kearny, to be used for Marine artillery and machine gun training. Camp Elliott became home to Fleet Marine Force Training Center, West Coast and the 2nd Marine Division, charged with defending the California coast. Runways were constructed in 1940, and the 1st Marine Air Wing arrived on December 21 of that year. The Navy commissioned Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) Camp Kearny in February 1943, specifically to train crews for the Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer, which was built less than away in San Diego. A month later, the Marines established Marine Corps Air Depot Camp Kearny, later renamed Marine Corps Air Depot Miramar, to avoid confusion with the Navy facility. The big Privateers proved too heavy for the asphalt concrete runway the Army had installed in 1936 and the longer runways built in 1940, so the Navy added two concrete runways in 1943. During the 1940s, both the Navy and the Marine Corps occupied Miramar. East Miramar (Camp Elliott) was used to train Marine artillery and armored personnel, while Navy and Marine Corps pilots trained on the western side. The bases were combined and designated Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in 1946. =Naval Air Station= NAS Miramar in 1954 In 1947, the Marines moved to MCAS El Toro in Orange County, California, and Miramar was redesignated as NAAS Miramar (Naval Auxiliary Air Station Miramar). It became NAS Miramar (Naval Air Station Miramar) on 1 March 1952. In 1954, the Navy offered NAS Miramar to San Diego for $1 and the city considered using the base to relocate its airport. But it was deemed at the time to be too far away from most residents and the offer was declined. Only the western half of Miramar's facilities were put to use, and the old station literally began to deteriorate, with many buildings sold as scrap. Miramar found new life as a Navy Master Jet Station in the 1950s. The eastern half, former Camp Elliot, was used by the United States Air Force for Project Orion (having been transferred temporarily), and later by NASA; it was the site of several launches. The base really came into its own during the Vietnam War. The Navy needed a school to train pilots in dog-fighting and in fleet air defense. In 1969 the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School was established organizationally as part of VF-121, which was then the F-4 Phantom Fleet Replacement Aviation Maintenance Personnel (FRAMP), which trained the maintainers who joined the fleet as qualified \\"Phantom Phixeres\\". In October 1972, Miramar welcomed the F-14 Tomcat and fighter squadron VF-124, a former Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) tasked with the mission to train new Tomcat crews. Formerly, VF-124 had been training pilots in the F-8 Crusader. That task was handed over to Light Photographic Squadron 63 (VFP-63) that then became \\"Crusader College\\" The first two operational Tomcat squadrons, VF-1 known as the \\"Wolfpack\\" and VF-2 known as the \\"Bounty Hunters,\\" trained here before deploying aboard in 1974. =Recent history= F/A-18 Hornet on the flight line at MCAS Miramar In 1993, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended that Marine Corps Air Station El Toro and Marine Corps Air Station Tustin be closed down and that NAS Miramar be transferred to the Marine Corps. BRAC also recommended that all Navy Pacific Fleet F-14 aircraft and squadrons (with the exception of those assigned to Carrier Air Wing 5 in Japan) and Pacific Fleet F-14 training be consolidated with the Atlantic Fleet and be relocated to NAS Oceana, Virginia. BRAC recommended that Pacific Fleet E-2C training be consolidated with Atlantic Fleet E-2C training at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, that all Pacific Fleet E-2C aircraft and squadrons (with the exception of those assigned to Carrier Air Wing 5 in Japan) be relocated to NAS Point Mugu, California and that the Naval Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN) and Navy Reserve adversary squadron VFC-13 be relocated to NAS Fallon, Nevada. In 1999, MCAS El Toro and MCAS Tustin were closed and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing returned to Miramar when it officially became Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. On October 1, 1997, Colonel Thomas A. Caughlan became the first Marine commanding officer of MCAS Miramar since World War II. Caughlan was also the last commanding officer of MCAS Tustin. In 2005, the BRAC Commission directed instructor pilots and support personnel from Miramar to Eglin AFB in Florida, sufficient to stand up the Marine Corps' portion of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program (JSF) Training Site. This will lead to an eventual phasing out of Fighter Pilot training at Miramar by 2015 as the F-18s are retired. In 2006, the San Diego County Proposition A proposed obtaining 3000 acres (12 km¬≤) at MCAS Miramar to develop a commercial airport.Proposition A: Commercial airport at MCAS Miramar ‚Äì San Diego County, CA SmartVoter.org The proposition was defeated 62 percent opposed to 38 percent in favor. =Noise= Numerous noise complaints have been lodged against MCAS Miramar (and its predecessor, NAS Miramar) going back for decades. MCAS Miramar is located near the center of the City of San Diego. It is surrounded on three sides by residential areas including Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch, University City, Clairemont, and Tierrasanta. MCAS Miramar has a web site and phone number that people can call to register complaints about noise. To lessen the noise impact to the community, MCAS Miramar has made adjustments to their operations over the years, including the use of hush-houses, limitations on engine run-ups, and modification to flight plans. In spite of efforts, noise complaints remain an issue in 2019. \\"Marines reprimand two fighter pilots for flight mistakes, amid Miramar neighbor noise complaints\\" https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/military/sd-me-miramar- complaints-20180127-story.html \\"Neighbors concerned with F-35 coming to MCAS Miramar https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/neighbors-concerned- with-f-35-coming-to-mcas-miramar\\" \\"Jet noise disturbs some Carmel Valley residents\\" https://www.delmartimes.net/sd-cm-nc-jetnoise-20180911-story.html  Based units  Flying and notable non-flying units based at MCAS Miramar: = United States Marine Corps = Marine Corps Installations ‚Äì West * Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron ‚Äì UC-12W Huron and UC-35D Citation 1st Marine Logistics Group * Combat Logistics Regiment 15 (CLR-15) ** Combat Logistics Company 11 (CLC-11) 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing * Marine Wing Headquarters Squadron 3 * Marine Air Control Group 38 ** Marine Tactical Air Command Squadron 38 ** Marine Wing Communications Squadron 38 * Marine Aircraft Group 11 ** Marine Aerial Refueller Squadron 352 (VMGR-352) ‚Äì KC-130J Hercules ** Marine All Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 225 (VMFA(AW)-225) ‚Äì F/A-18D Hornet ** Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 11 (MALS-11) ** Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 (VMFA-232) ‚Äì F/A-18C Hornet ** Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 (VMFA-314) ‚Äì F-35C Lightning II ** Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323 (VMFA-323) ‚Äì F/A-18C Hornet ** Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 101 (VMFAT-101) ‚Äì F/A18C/D Hornet and T-34C Turbo Mentor * Marine Aircraft Group 16 ** Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 16 (MALS-16) ** Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361 (HMH-361) ‚Äì CH-53E Super Stallion ** Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 462 (HMH-462) ‚Äì CH-53E Super Stallion ** Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 465 (HMH-465) ‚Äì CH-53E Super Stallion ** Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 466 (HMH-466) ‚Äì CH-53E Super Stallion ** Marine Medium Tilt-Rotor Squadron 161 (VMM-161) ‚Äì MV-22B Osprey ** Marine Medium Tilt-Rotor Squadron 163 (VMM-163) ‚Äì MV-22B Osprey ** Marine Medium Tilt-Rotor Squadron 165 (VMM-165) ‚Äì MV-22B Osprey ** Marine Medium Tilt-Rotor Squadron 166 (VMM-166) ‚Äì MV-22B Osprey ** Marine Medium Tilt-Rotor Squadron 362 (VMM-362) ‚Äì MV-22B Osprey ** Marine Medium Tilt-Rotor Squadron 764 (VMM-764) ‚Äì MV-22B Osprey * Marine Wing Support Group 37 ** Marine Wing Support Squadron 373 (MWSS-373) = United States Navy = Navy Personnel Command * Naval Consolidated Brig Miramar Crashes There have been a number of aviation accidents: * On 4 December 1959, an F3H Demon with Navy pilot ENS Albert Joe Hickman crashed into the adjoining community of Clairemont Mesa.

Nicknamed the \\"Red Devils\\", the squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). The Red Devils are the oldest and most decorated fighter squadron in the Marine Corps. History =The early years= FB-5 with VF-3M insignia VMFA-232 can trace its lineage back to VF-3M, which was commissioned on September 1, 1925, at Naval Air Station San Diego, California.Sambito 1978, p. 1. Originally equipped with Vought VE-7s, the squadron received three of the new Boeing FB-1s in the first part of 1926, allowing them to operate one division of modern aircraft while retaining the older VE-7s for training purposes. With the civil war in China threatening American interests, it was decided to deploy U.S. forces and in November and December 1926, seven additional FB-1s were transferred to VF-3M from VF-1M and VF-2M on the east coast, bringing the squadron's complement to 10 FB-1s. As diplomacy and planning was taking place on the international level, the squadron concentrated on familiarizing itself with their new aircraft and training the influx of new pilots. On April 7, 1927, VF-3M departed San Diego bound for China on the transport , but upon arrival, no airfield was available for operations. After waiting in the Philippines for almost two months, the squadron returned to China and eventually operated from airfields at Tientsin and Hsin-Ho, where they supported the 3rd Brigade. Shortly after setting up camp and starting flight operations, the squadron was redesignated VF-10M on July 1, 1927, the first of many changes in designation caused by the reorganization of naval aviation assets. The mission to China demonstrated that Marine Aviation was vital to the expeditionary role Marine forces were called on to perform and the squadron performed photography, mapping and reconnaissance missions while deployed. Another change in designation occurred while the squadron was still in China, when on July 1, 1928, the squadron was redesignated VF-6M. With its mission in China completed, the squadron withdrew on October 3, 1928, arriving back at San Diego on October 31, 1928, after stops at Guam and Hawaii.Sambito 1978, pp. 1‚Äì2. A VB-4M F4B-4 in 1933-35. With its return to San Diego, most of the squadron's personnel were transferred to other units and the next year was spent re-organizing and training new personnel as they arrived. In addition to new pilots, several Boeing FB-5s were assigned to the squadron in 1929, the last of the in-line aircraft to be used by Marine squadrons. On July 1, 1930 the squadron was again re- designated, this time reverting to VF-10M, but the most noticeable change was the replacement of the FB-5s with Curtiss F6C-4s, the first radial engine fighters the squadron would be assigned. The squadron would operate the F6C-4s for over two years and be awarded the Herbert H. Schiff Cup for aviation safety before they were replaced by factory-fresh Boeing F4B-4s in late 1932, the most advanced biplane fighter in service at that time. VMB-2 was equipped with the first Douglas SBD-1s in 1940 In 1932, it was determined that Marine Aviation should be provided with two light bombing squadrons, and on July 1, 1933, VF-10M became VB-4M, and was re-equipped with Boeing F4B-3s, a move considered a step back by members of the squadron. Participation in the Los Angeles National Air Races and annual Fleet Exercises were part of the routine that marked the squadron's activity in the early 1930s. In 1935, the squadron received 16 Great Lakes BG-1s, large two-place dive bombers that would equip the squadron for over five years. On July 1, 1937, Marine aviation was completely reorganized to conform to Navy requirements, and VB-4M became VMB-2. Still flying the BG-1, the squadron continued to take part in the annual Fleet Exercises, and in December 1940, the squadron began receiving the new Douglas SBD-1, the first mono-plane in Marine Corps service. Arrival of the SBD also marked the first time that the Red Devil insignia was not carried on the squadron's aircraft, even though it was authorized to do so. =World War II= With the tension in the Pacific increasing, VMB-2 was deployed to Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Oahu, Hawaii. Early 1941 also saw the transition from the colorful pre-war scheme to the tactical, and less colorful, light gray scheme, but still the Red Devil insignia was absent. On July 1, 1941, in anticipation of the large expansion marine aviation was about to undergo, VMB-2 became VMSB-232, the designation it carried during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during which one member of the squadron was killed and nine of the squadron's aircraft were destroyed, with ten more requiring major overhaul. On Wake Island, a Red Devil detachment suffered twenty five enlisted Marines killed or captured while assisting in the defense of the doomed island. On August 20, 1942, the squadron became part of the Cactus Air Force. and flew SBD Dauntlesses from Guadalcanal's 3,000-foot dirt runway Henderson Field. The Red Devils became the first Marine dive bomber squadron to fly against the Japanese. They left Guadalcanal on October 12, 1942, and headed for Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California, where they were redesignated yet again as Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 232 (VMTB-232), flying newly acquired Grumman TBF Avengers. They returned to the Pacific in July 1943 when they were originally based in Espiritu Santo. From there they moved to Munda in order to support allied forces during the Bougainville landings in November 1943. For the next few months the squadron participated in strikes against the isolated Japanese garrison at Rabaul. On February 14, 1944, Avengers from VMTB-232 and VMTB-233 took part in a mission to sow mines in Simpson Harbor at Rabaul. The Grumman TBM Avengers were to fly up in three groups of eight each at the speed of 160 knots to drop their parachute-mines, weighing 1,600 pounds a piece. The first group lost one plane. The commanding officer tried to radio the other TBFs to warn them to turn back but he couldn't make radio contact. The second group lost two planes. The third group was immediately found by searchlight and anti-aircraft guns while flying at 800 feet over the water and had five aircraft shot down. Six planes and eighteen men were lost during the attack.Foster 1961, pp. 192‚Äì193. Four of the eighteen men survived the loss of the six TBFs that evening. Of the four, none survived captivity. One was murdered at Tunnel Hill, two died of starvation, disease or medical neglect, and a fourth was murdered by the Japanese Navy some time in April. The next few months would see them move continuously, operating from Piva, Green Island, Emirau and Ulithi. VMTB-232 landed at Kadena on April 22, 1945, and began flying close air support missions three days later and for the rest of the Battle of Okinawa. In July 1945 they began to fly strikes against the Japanese mainland until the surrender of Japan.Sherrod (1952), p. 464. During its participation in operations throughout World War II, VMTB-232 lost forty- nine Marines and seventeen aircraft. On November 16, 1945, the squadron, one of the few to earn two presidential citations during the war, arrived at San Diego, and was temporarily decommissioned. =1950s= An FJ-4B of VMF-232 in 1958. On June 3, 1948 the Red Devils were reactivated as a reserve fighter squadron at NAS New York / Floyd Bennett Field, New York, with the name it currently holds; Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232. With the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, the squadron was placed on alert and ordered to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California. Here, the squadron received its first delivery of the F4U Corsair. Although the unit itself did not deploy to Korea, by April 1951 nearly all the original aviators and forty percent of the enlisted Marines in the squadron had been detached and sent overseas for combat duty.

In 1954, homebase for 232 was changed from MCAS El Toro, to Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, where they flew the FJ Fury, the \\"Navalized\\" version of the F-86 Sabre. In March 1956, the Red Devils, VMF 232 set a \\"till that time\\" record of 2558 flight hours and 1571 sorties in one month. The Red Devils moved to the final version of the Fury, the FJ-4 from '56-'59. VMF 232 was deployed to Westpac on the USS Bennington during the Quemoy Matsu Crisis in the fall of 1958 and later was stationed at Naval Air Facility Atsugi. That year the squadron flew over 10,000 hours and was named by the Commandant, the Marine Fighter Squadron of the Year. In 1958 the squadron returned from Japan to transition into the F-8 Crusader. =Vietnam War= F-4J 155811: This aircraft was the only Marine jet lost to enemy aircraft in Vietnam, 26 August 1972. An F-4S from VMFA-232 on display at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C. As a result of intensified operations in Southeast Asia, VMF(AW)-232 departed MCAS Kaneohe Bay, and were flying combat sorties out of Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam by December 1966. Staying online for the next 290 consecutive days, the squadron flew 5,785 sorties encompassing 7,273 flight hours and delivering 6,221 tons of ordnance. The squadron's aircraft were equipped with TPQ-10 bombing radar receivers thus making them ideal close air support platforms. They were also the only Marine aircraft capable of carrying 2,000-pound bombs until the arrival of Marine A-6 Intruders. In September 1967, the squadron returned to MCAS El Toro and painted the Red Devil insignia on their new McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms. Redesignated as Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232, the squadron returned to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. In March 1969, the squadron deployed to MAG 13 at Chu Lai Air Base, Vietnam, supporting ground operations in I Corps. They returned to Iwakuni in late 1969. In April 1972, the entire squadron redeployed from Japan to Vietnam with minimum notice to counter the spring offensive of that year. After a three-month stay at Da Nang Air Base, VMFA-232 moved its operations to Royal Thai Air Base Nam Phong, Thailand. Here they continued to fly air to ground sorties in addition to playing a key fighter role on Operation Linebacker missions over North Vietnam. During their time operating out of Thailand, the squadron lost three F-4J Phantoms and two crewman. One of these aircraft was shot down by a MiG-21 over North Vietnam. The only \\"last\\" in VMFA-232's history occurred in September 1973 as the Red Devils became the last Marine squadron to leave the Vietnam War. The squadron remained at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan as a force in readiness while participating in numerous training deployments and exercises. In 1974, the Red Devils received the coveted Robert M. Hanson \\"Marine Fighter Attack Squadron of the Year\\" award. In October 1977, the Red Devils of VMFA-232 returned to MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, after an eleven-year absence. This event, in turn, marked the beginning of Red Devils participation in the demanding Westpac Unit Deployment Program. In October 1986, the Red Devils completed their sixth, and last six- month tour of the Western Pacific in the venerable F-4 Phantom. In December 1988, VMFA-232 turned in their last F-4 Phantom II to the National Air and Space Museum. =1980s and 1990s= In early 1989, the Red Devils began their transition to the F/A-18 Hornet. Aircrew trained at VMFAT-101 at MCAS El Toro and the maintenance department at FRAMP at NAS Lemoore, California. In June 1989, with return of aircrew and maintenance personnel to Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, and receipt of their twelfth Hornet, the Red Devils had completed the transition. In December 1990, with intensification of Operation Desert Shield, the squadron deployed to Shaikh Isa, Bahrain. On January 17, 1991, the Red Devils were among the first to cross the Iraqi border during Operation Desert Storm. After 41 days of intense combat operations, Kuwait was liberated as the Red Devils completed 740 combat missions and 1,390 hours. For their outstanding performance in Southwest Asia, VMFA-232 received the Navy Unit Commendation. Returning to Hawaii in April 1991, the squadron spent four short months at home before they were again deployed to Westpac. Upon completion of their Westpac deployment in July 1993, the squadron stopped briefly at MCAS Kaneohe Bay en route to their new home at MCAS El Toro, California, ending a sixteen-year absence. In October 1993, a significant milestone was reached when members of the Hornet Industry Team presented the squadron with a plaque honoring the Red Devils for achieving 50,000 accident free flight hours. This achievement spans almost 13 years of flying in the F-4 and F/A-18. An F/A-18 Hornet from VMFA-232 flying during Operation Iraqi Freedom The squadron returned to Iwakuni in February 1996 and began what was to be a most memorable WestPac. While deployed to WestPac, the squadron achieved two impressive milestones. The squadron was honored as it received both the 1995 Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award as they surpassed 66,000 hours and 17 years of mishap free flying, and the 1996 Marine Corps Aviation Association's, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron of the Year Award. VMFA-232 returned to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in August 1996. =Global War on Terror= The squadron deployed to Kuwait in January 2003 and took part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the three and a half weeks of the war the squadron flew 1,150 hours during 540 sorties dropping 620,000 pounds of ordnance. The squadron returned to MCAS Miramar in April 2003. In 2005, VMFA-232 became part of the United States Navy's Carrier Air Wing 11. In May 2005 they deployed with the rest of CVW-11 aboard the to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf, participating in combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and multinational exercises with Japan, Egypt, and India until November 2005. Early in the Nimitz deployment, several of the squadron members were interviewed for the PBS documentary Carrier. In 2007 the squadron deployed on the Nimitz again for a six-month cruise to the Persian Gulf. Four months later they did another WestPac deployment on the Nimitz. In January 2010 VMFA-232 accepted two F/A-18D Hornet aircraft and left in May 2010 for a deployment to Kandahar, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. While in Afghanistan the Red Devils flew 4,090 Flight hours encompassing 1190 sorties and dropped 240,000 lbs of ordnance and expended 30,000 rounds of 20mm ammunition. They returned to MCAS Miramar in November 2010.'Red Devils' clear path for 'Werewolves' =2015 Crash= On 21 October 2015, an F/A-18C of VMFA-232 crashed in East Anglia, United Kingdom near the airbases at RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall.'US Marine Corps pilot killed in F-18 jet crash in Cambridgeshire Fens' The aircraft was reportedly one of six transitting through RAF Lakenheath following a deployment in the Middle East.

C. Row Expressway is a municipal expressway in the city of Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It divides the city in half as it crosses it between the Ojibway Parkway in the west and Banwell Road in the east, a distance of . It was built between 1971 and 1983, reaching completion across the city on June 9, 1983. It was part of Highway 2 and Highway 18 until the province transferred ownership and responsibility for the route to the City of Windsor on April 1, 1997. In 2015, the westernmost was significantly upgraded as part of the Highway 401 extension (Herb Gray Parkway) project. The freeway is named after Edward Charles Row, the president of Chrysler Canada between 1951 and 1956. While allowing for easy travel across the city, the E.C. Row Expressway was isolated for much of its existence as it did not connect directly to the United States nor Highway 401; drivers had to access the Ambassador Bridge via Huron Church Road, or the Detroit‚ÄìWindsor Tunnel via Dougall Parkway, both surface streets were also needed to reach Highway 401\\\\. This situation is being rectified from 2011 onward, as the expressway's western terminus is located at the port of entry for the Gordie Howe International Bridge scheduled for completion in 2024,Dave Battagello, \\"Gordie Howe bridge to cost $5.7B, open in 2024\\".

It begins at a signalized intersection with the Ojibway Parkway, curving gently from northeastward to eastward. It travels east-northeast as a four lane fully controlled-access freeway with a grass median and grade-separated interchanges. E. C. Row facing west at Huron Church Road prior to construction of the Herb Gray Parkway After crossing Matchette Road, where ramps provide access to and from the eastbound and westbound lanes of the expressway, respectively, the opposing lanes of the expressway split to the south of Malden Park. The eastbound lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway, sandwiching it between the E. C Row Expressway. Slip ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the eastbound carriageway of the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area. The highway quickly meets another interchange at Howard Avenue, where it also crosses Turkey Creek and the former alignment of Grand Marais Road. Southeast of this interchange is Devonshire Mall while to the north are low- density commercial units. East of the interchange, the E. C. Row once again travels between residential subdivisions. To the north lies Remington Park while to the south is Devonshire Heights. Crossing into Walkerville at a diamond interchange with Walker Road, the highway becomes surrounded by a business park; the Walker Road interchange also connects with the Central Avenue interchange. This also marks the end of the illuminated section of the expressway. Now north of Windsor Airport, the route crosses over the Canadian Pacific Windsor Subdivision just west of a partial interchange with Jefferson Boulevard, which provides westbound access to and eastbound access from the expressway. The route passes south of the Ford Essex Engine Plant before meeting the Lauzon Parkway at an interchange. It crosses Little River before entering an area with a subdivision to the north and a commercial park to the south. The commercial zoning eventually transitions to agricultural fields, and the E. C. Row Expressway curves northeast and intersects Banwell Road at- grade. East of Banwell Road, the road continues as the Pike Creek Bypass, former Highway 2.  History  The history of the E.C. Row Expressway dates back to January 1963, when the City of Windsor and the Department of Highways released a report called The Windsor Area Transportation Study (WATS). One of the primary issues identified by the study was \\"a limited and inadequate street network in the east-west direction generally resulting from several railway barriers\\". Properties were purchased along E.C. Row Avenue (named in 1956 after the retiring president of Chrysler Canada (1951-1956), Ohio-born E.C. Row) and the Third Concession within Sandwich Township beginning in 1958 for what was then intended as a two-lane road linking Highway 18 with Highway 39 (which became Highway 2 in 1970). However, with the release of WATS and the subsequent amalgamation in 1966 in which Windsor annexed portions of the surrounding townships, plans for an expressway along the corridor were first conceived. The original plans for the expressway dating back to 1969 were for it to travel from current County Road 22, heading west along the southern edge of Belle River and Tecumseh, meeting up with the current two-lane freeway alignment (Pike Creek Bypass) just east of Puce, as well as having the west end continue south through Lasalle to north of Amherstburg. The first stage of construction began in 1970 to bridge the two sections of E.C. Row Avenue over the CN railway line between Dougall Avenue (then Highway 3B) and Howard Avenue (a former alignment of Highway 2); this work was completed in 1973. In 1976, contracts were awarded to extend the new divided expressway east to Walker Avenue. At the request of Ford Motor Company of Canada, construction on the expressway was soon accelerated. By early 1980, the existing construction contracts were completed, and work began to connect the expressway between Huron Church Road and Dougall Avenue. Construction of a two-laned extension west to connect with the Ojibway Parkway (Highway 18) began by the end of that year. By April 1982, the four-laned expressway was complete between Huron Church Road and east of Lauzon Parkway, connecting with Highway 2 as a two lane expressway at Banwell Road in the east, and with Ojibway Parkway via a two-lane expressway west of Huron Church Road. Following this, Highway 2 was rerouted west of Banwell Road off Tecumseth Road to instead travel along the expressway, while Highway 18 was rerouted off Sandwich Street to follow the expressway; both then followed Highway 3 along Huron Church Road to the Ambassador Bridge. Construction stalled for several years as funding was diverted from the project during a recession in the early 1980s. It would take until 1987 for work to resume to replace the at-grade intersections at Matchette Road, Malden Road, Huron Church Road and Dominion Boulevard. The City of Windsor nevertheless earmarked funding from their budget to build the last two of those interchanges in late 1986. The province later stepped in to provide a share of the funding in March 1987, and work began with contracts being awarded for construction on August 26 and September 16 of that year for interchanges at Dominion Boulevard and Huron Church Road, respectively. The City of Windsor also negotiated with the province for funding of an interchange at Matchette Road in late April of that year, which was approved by September 1. On September 29, 1988, the Huron Church Road and Dominion Boulevard interchanges were opened to traffic. Work began in October 1989 to twin the existing two-laned route between the Ojibway Parkway and Huron Church Road by building a second parallel roadway to serve as the eastbound lanes. Construction of a partial interchange at Matchette Road as well as an overpass of Malden Road was included in this project, which was completed in September 1990. The project to complete the expressway in the east ‚Äî by twinning the route between Lauzon Parkway and the Windsor boundary east of Banwell Road ‚Äî began immediately after; it was completed in late 1991. The overall cost of the expressway between Ojibway Parkway and Banwell Road, originally estimated (in 1967) at $55 million, was $115 million, out of which the province contributed $94 million. Planning subsequently began to extend the expressway east to Manning Road along the existing two-lane Pike Creek Bypass. However, budget constraints brought on by a recession in the early 1990s resulted in the Mike Harris provincial government forming the Who Does What? committee to determine cost-cutting measures in order to balance the budget after a deficit incurred under premier Bob Rae. It was determined that many Ontario highways no longer served long-distance traffic movement and should, therefore, be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998, removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network. As the E. C. Row Expressway was designed to serve commuter traffic in Windsor, and not province-wide movement, the route was transferred to the City of Windsor on April 1, 1997. No work has progressed on the extension since. Beginning in 2011, the E.C. Row Expressway west of Huron Church Road underwent a complete reconstruction as part of the $1.4 billion Herb Gray Parkway project which included a major realignment of of the eastbound carriageway between Matchette Road and Huron Church Road to allow for an extension of Highway 401 to travel within their median, while the westbound lanes of the E.C. Row remained largely unchanged except for the addition of streetlights. The project was completed on November 21, 2015 and allows E.C. Row traffic to connect with the bridge-bound portion of Highway 401 via slip ramps located east of Machete Road. The E.C. Row still lacks direct access to the London-bound portion of Highway 401, however, the completion of phase one of the Highway 401 extension (Herb Gray Parkway) means that the indirect connection using Huron Church Road has been reduced to a short distance (with one traffic light) between the Parclo A4 interchange with the E.C. Row and the slip ramps with Highway 401. In 2015, construction began on the widening and expansion of E.C. Row's eastern extension, County Road 22. The highway was widened to four lanes from Banwell Road to E Puce Road (County Road 25) in Puce. As of 2018, this project has been completed and includes a roundabout at the intersection of County Road 22 and Old Tecumseh Road  Exit list   See also  * List of numbered roads in Essex County  References  Expressways in Canada Transport in Windsor, Ontario Roads in Essex County, Ontario ","title":"E.

Waltheof remained in this position for the remainder of his life, even though he was offered of the bishopric of St Andrews in early 1159, which he declined. He died at Melrose Abbey on 3 August 1159.For this paragraph, see Derek Baker, \\"Waldef (c. 1095‚Äì1159)\\", in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 28 Nov 2006 Following the death of Waltheof, his successor as Abbot of Melrose, Abbot William, refused to encourage the rumours that were now spreading regarding Waltheof's saintliness. Abbot William attempted to silence these rumours, and prevent the intrusiveness of would-be pilgrims. However, William was unable to get the better of Waltheof's emerging cult, and now his actions were alienating him from his brethren. As a result, in April 1170, William resigned the abbacy.For the account of Abbot William and the cult of Waltheof, see Richard Fawcetts and Richard Oram, Melrose Abbey, (Stroud, 2004), pp. 23‚Äì4. In William's place, Jocelin, the prior of Melrose, became abbot. Jocelin had no such scruples. Jocelin embraced the cult without hesitation. Under the year of Jocelin's accession, it was reported in the Chronicle of Melrose that: > The tomb of our pious father, sir Waltheof, the second abbot of Melrose, was > opened by Enguerrand, of good memory, the bishop of Glasgow, and by four > abbots called in for this purpose; and his body was found entire, and his > vestments intact, in the twelfth year from his death, on the eleventh day > before the Kalends of June [22 May]. And after the holy celebration of mass, > the same bishop, and the abbots whose number we have mentioned above, placed > over the remains of his most holy body a new stone of polished marble. And > there was great gladness; those who were present exclaiming together, and > saying that truly this was a man of God ...Chronicle of Melrose, s.a. 1171, > trans. A.O.

Promoting saints was something Jocelin would repeat as Bishop of Glasgow, where he would commission a hagiography of Saint Kentigern, the saint most venerated by the Celts of the diocese of Glasgow. It is no coincidence that Jocelin of Furness, who wrote the Life of St. Waltheof, was the same man later commissioned to write the Life of St. Kentigern. Jocelin's actions ensured Waltheof's posthumous de facto sainthood; and the need of Melrose Abbey to have its own saint's cult, ensured the cult's longevity.

It consists of a number of rods, from which weighted objects or further rods hang. The objects hanging from the rods balance each other, so that the rods remain more or less horizontal. Each rod hangs from only one string, which gives it the freedom to rotate about the string. An ensemble of these balanced parts hang freely in space, by design without coming into contact with each other. Mobiles are popular in the nursery, where they hang over cribs to give infants entertainment and visual stimulation. Mobiles have inspired many composers, including Morton Feldman and Earle Brown who were inspired by Alexander Calder's mobiles to create mobile-like indeterminate pieces. John Cage wrote the music for the short film Works of Calder that focused on Calder's mobiles. Frank Zappa also claimed that his compositions were modelled on Calder mobiles.  Origin  The meaning of the term \\"mobile\\" as applied to sculpture has evolved since it was first suggested by Marcel Duchamp in 1931 to describe the early, mechanized creations of Alexander Calder.Tomkins, Calvin: Duchamp: A Biography, pages 294. Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1996. At this point, \\"mobile\\" was synonymous with the term \\"kinetic art\\", describing sculptural works in which motion is a defining property. While motor or crank-driven moving sculptures may have initially prompted it, the word \\"mobile\\" later came to refer more specifically to Calder's free-moving creations. Influenced by the abstract work of Piet Mondrian, Joan Mir√≥ and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Calder in many respects invented an art form where objects (typically brightly coloured, abstract shapes fashioned from sheet metal) are connected by wire much like a balance scale. By the sequential attachment of additional objects, the final creation consists of many balanced parts joined by lengths of wire whose individual elements are capable of moving independently or as a whole when prompted by air movement or direct contact. Thus, \\"mobile\\" has become a more well-defined term with its origin in the many such hanging constructs Calder produced in a prolific manner between the 1930s and his death in 1976.  Similar works  Calder's work is the only one defined by the term \\"mobile\\"; however, three other notable artists worked on a similar concept. Man Ray experimented with this idea around 1920, Armando Rever√≥n who during the 30s made a series of movable skeletons and Bruno Munari created his \\"Useless Machines\\" in 1933, made in cardboard and playful colors.Munari, Bruno: Air Made Visible, 288 pages, Lars M√ºller Publishers, 2001.

Oxford: OUP, 1992. p 141. - 7 April 1977Orlando Project) was an English poet. Life Daryush was the daughter of Robert Bridges; her maternal grandfather was Alfred Waterhouse. She married Ali Akbar Daryush, a Persian government official whom she had met when he was studying at the University of Oxford, and thereafter spent some time in Persia; most of her life was spent at the Bridges' family home, Stockwell, in Boars Hill, outside Oxford. The garden of their Boars Hill home was left by Ali as a memorial garden, named after Elizabeth, and managed by the Oxford Preservation Trust. Writings =Poetry= Daryush, daughter of English poet laureate Robert Bridges (some of her early work was published as Elizabeth Bridges), followed her father's lead not only in choosing poetry as her life's work but also in the traditional style of poetry she chose to write. The themes of her work are often critical of the upper classes and the social injustice their privilege levied upon others. This characteristic was not present in her early work, including her first two books of poems, published under the name Elizabeth Bridges, which appeared while she was still in her twenties. According to John Finlay, writing in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Daryush's \\"early poetry is preoccupied with rather conventional subject matter and owes a great deal to the Edwardians.\\" =Syllabic style= Daryush took her father's experiment in syllabic verse a step farther by making it less experimental; whereas Bridges' syllable count excluded elidable syllables, producing some variation in the total number of pronounced syllables per line, Daryush's was strictly aural, counting all syllables actually sounded when the poem was read aloud. It is for her successful experiments with syllabic meter that Daryush is best known to contemporary readers, as exampled in her poem Accentedal in the quaternion form.'Biography of Elizabeth Daryush' MyPoeticSide.com Yvor Winters, the poet and critic, considered Daryush more successful in writing syllabics than was her father, noting that her poem Still-Life was her finest syllabic experiment,Winters, Yvor, Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of American Experimental Poetry Arrow Editions , New York , 1937 and also a companion-piece to Children of Wealth.Davie, Donald, The Poetry of Elizabeth Daryush Poetry Nation No 5 1975 Winters considered the social context of Still Life, which is nowhere mentioned, yet from which the poem draws its power.Winters, Yvor: Uncolllected Essays and Reviews , edited by Francis Murphy, Chicago 1973 =Characteristics= Beyond its social content, Daryush's work is also recognized for a consistent and well-defined personal vision. As Finlay noted, \\"For her. . .poetry always dealt with the \`stubborn fact' of life as it is, and the only consolations it offered were those of understanding and a kind of half-Christian, half-stoical acceptance of the inevitable.\\" However, he also argued that Daryush's best poems transcend such fatalism, \\"dealing with the moral resources found in one's own being. . .and a recognition of the beauties in the immediate, ordinary world around us.\\" In many of her terse short poems, there is formal and intellectual mastery; her last, longest and most ambitious poem, 'Air and Variations,' was a formal tribute to Gerard Manly Hopkins Schmidt Michael, Reading Modern Poetry Routledge London 1989 Daryush has been described as a pioneer technical innovator, a poet of the highest dedication and seriousness whose poetry grapples with life's intensest issues.Fuller, Roy, in Preface to Verses: seventh book by Elizabeth Daryush, Carcanet Press, Oxford 1971 Works * Sonnets from Hafez and other Verses (1921) as Elizabeth Bridges * Verses (1930) (OUP) * Verses, Fourth Book (1934) * Poems (1935) (Macmillan)https://www.poemhunter.com/i/ebooks/pdf/elizabeth_daryush_2012_7.pdf?fbclid=IwAR00KfYboFCE_zTWrqb3FKQYuSFGxAbyOxwyD6PbByAvAZPgK_lL0HxiDtc * The Last Man and Other Verses (1936) * Selected Poems (1948) edited by Yvor Winters * Verses: Seventh Book (1971) Carcanet Press * Selected Poems (1972) Carcanet Press * Collected Poems (1976) Carcanet Press References External links  Examples of Daryush poetry inc Still-Life * The Poetry of Elizabeth Daryush - by Donald Davie Poetry Nation No 5 1975 1887 births 1977 deaths English women poets 20th-century English poets 20th-century English women writers ","title":"Elizabeth Daryush"},{"id":"994039","text":"Mobile Office on the Streets of London.

Typically, mobile offices in North America feature a single phase split (240 volt center-tapped) electric service that is connected to a nearby source of power, to run small window- unit air conditioners, and the like. There are many types of companies that sell, lease, rent new and used storage containers, portable buildings or modular buildings.

History The Royal Green Jackets was formed on 1 January 1966 by the amalgamation of the three separate regiments of the Green Jackets Brigade: the 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd), the 2nd Green Jackets, the King's Royal Rifle Corps and the 3rd Green Jackets, the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own). There were also two Territorial Army battalions made up as follows: * 4th (V) Battalion, Royal Green Jackets ‚Äì formed from the remnants of the Rangers (KRRC), London Rifle Brigade, Tower Hamlets Rifles, Queen's Westminsters, Queen Victoria's Rifles, Queen's Royal Rifles and Civil Service Rifles. * 5th (V) Battalion, Royal Green Jackets ‚Äì formed from the 4th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (TA) and the Buckinghamshire Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. During the 1980s, the battalions were deployed to various parts of Northern Ireland (Operation Banner). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions were also based in West Germany, Osnabr√ºck (1RGJ), Minden (2RGJ) and Celle (3RGJ). The regiment's greatest loss of life came on 20 July 1982 when seven RGJ bandsmen were killed by a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb which exploded during a public concert featuring the music from Oliver! to 120 people at the bandstand in Regents Park. In 1992, 1/RGJ was disbanded and 2/RGJ and 3/RGJ renumbered 1/RGJ and 2/RGJ respectively. After the 1992 reorganisation, the unit was mostly based overseas in Dhekelia, Cyprus and Paderborn, Germany as well as in Northern Ireland and saw action in Bosnia and Kosovo during the Yugoslav Wars. Both battalions returned to the United Kingdom by 2002 and in 2003 the 1st Battalion served on Operation Telic 2 in Iraq. On 24 November 2005, the Ministry of Defence announced that the regiment would amalgamate with The Light Infantry, the Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry and the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry to form a single large regiment to be called The Rifles. The reorganisation into The Rifles took effect on 1 February 2007 with the 1st Battalion Royal Green Jackets becoming the 2nd Battalion, The Rifles and the 2nd Battalion Royal Green Jackets becoming 4th Battalion, The Rifles. The 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets' final operational tour was in Basra, in Iraq, on Operation Telic in 2006/7.Draper, p. 17 Regimental museum The Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum is based at Peninsula Barracks in Winchester. Traditions Their motto was Celer et Audax (Latin: \\"Swift and Bold\\"). As they were used as shock troops and marksmen, they had to get to the front line of battle as fast as was possible; as a result the RGJ marched at 140 paces per minute (at a 30\\" pace) whereas other regiments march at just 120. The regiment was classed as a 'rifle' regiment, having its lineage in the regiments of foot that were equipped with the first Baker rifles. Traditionally, rifle regiments wore rifle green tunics, an early form of camouflage, instead of the red jackets worn by line infantry, hence the regimental name. The cap badge was a Maltese Cross, which was drawn from the badges of the King's Royal Rifle Corps and The Rifle Brigade, with a combination of some of their battle honours on its arms.

He was best known for his appearances with the American professional wrestling promotions Extreme Championship Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment under the ring name Mike Awesome and for his appearances in Japan with Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling as The Gladiator.He is overall a three-time world champion. Alfonso achieved the biggest success of his career in FMW as The Gladiator, where he became a three-time world champion, with two reigns as Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion and one reign as Independent Heavyweight Champion. His second Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship reign from 1996-1997 was the longest reign in the title's history, lasting for 489 days. During this reign, he defeated W*ING Kanemura to unify the title with the Independent Heavyweight Championship at the 1996 Year End Spectacular. He would then tour with ECW, where he became a two-time World Heavyweight Champion. He was a member of two separate stables Team Canada in both FMW and WCW. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1989‚Äì1990)= Alfonso was trained to wrestle by Steve Keirn, debuting on February 26, 1989 at the Eddie Graham Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida.Loverro, Thom (2006). The Rise and Fall of ECW. Pocket Books. . p. 127 Alfonso trained for about one year along with former professional wrestlers, Dennis Knight (Mideon, Phineas Godwin) and the late \\"Big\\" Al Green before making his debut. Alfonso competed in Florida Championship Wrestling, USWA, NWA and World Championship Wrestling, before making his way to FMW in Japan. =Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling= Initial years (1990-1992) Alfonso moved on to Japan, joining Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) in September 1990 and using the name The Gladiator. He was recruited by FMW as the replacement for Al Green, who was originally scheduled to compete as Gladiator but moved to WCW. Alfonso debuted in FMW as a monster villain on September 20 in a street fight with Mr. Pogo against Atsushi Onita and Jimmy Backlund, which Alfonso's team won. Gladiator was Pogo's ally who feuded with Onita and competed with Pogo against Onita and his partners. He lost to Onita in a Chain Deathmatch on October 1, after which Alfonso returned to United States. Onita was impressed by Gladiator and called him back for more tours with FMW. He returned to the company as Mr. Pogo's partner in a tag team tournament on January 6, 1991, where the duo lost their first match in the tournament against Onita and Sambo Asako. Pogo and Gladiator made to the semi- final, where they beat Grigory Verichev and Boris Gogichashivili and then defeated Onita and Asako in the final on January 15 to win the tournament. The success of the tournament led Alfonso to work full-time with FMW. In the summer of 1991, Gladiator would form a villainous alliance with Tarzan Goto, Big Titan and Horace Boulder after Mr. Pogo's departure from FMW and resumed the feud with Atsushi Onita. On August 17, Gladiator participated in the Barbed Wire Deathmatch Tournament, in which he defeated Horace Boulder in the quarter-final and lost to Sambo Asako in the semi-final. During this time, Gladiator was inspired by Damian's lucha libre videos on travels, which led him to adopt a high-flying style despite his big size. The following month, Gladiator and Big Titan defeated Sambo Asako and Ricky Fuji in a street fight stretcher match at the 2nd Anniversary Show. This partnership led the two to form a tag team which lasted nearly three years. In the fall of the year, Gladiator and Titan participated in the World's Strongest Tag Team Tournament to determine the inaugural WWA World Martial Arts Tag Team Champions, but were eliminated from the round robin stage with total six points. Gladiator and his allies would join The Sheik and Sabu to resume the feud with Onita and his allies throughout 1992. At 3rd Anniversary Show, Big Titan, The Gladiator and Horace Boulder defeated Sambo Asako, Ricky Fuji and The Great Punk in a street fight stretcher match. Later that year, Gladiator and Boulder participated in the Street Fight Tag Team Tournament, where they qualified for the semi-final against Tarzan Goto and Big Titan, which they lost. Team Canada and W*ING Alliance (1993-1995) In 1993, Gladiator formed the first villainous faction in FMW called Team Canada with Ricky Fuji, Big Titan, Horace Boulder, Dr. Luther and Dr. Hannibal after The Sheik and Sabu turned fan favorites and formed an alliance with Atsushi Onita. At 4th Anniversary Show, the team of Gladiator, Ricky Fuji and Big Titan defeated Katsuji Ueda, The Great Punk and Tarzan Goto in a Captain's Fall Losing Captain Leaves Town No Rope Barbed Wire Tornado Street Fight Deathmatch, which Team Canada won. The group strengthened its dominance after Mr. Pogo returned to FMW in the summer of 1993 and took over as the leader of the group. Gladiator and Titan were defeated by Sambo Asako and Mr. Gannosuke at Summer Spectacular. The team of Gladiator, Titan and Fuji gained more success by defeating Asako, Katsuji Ueda and Grigory Verichev in a street fight at Year End Spectacular. The following year, Gladiator and Titan participated in a double-elimination tournament for the newly created Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship, in which they defeated Hideki Hosaka and Hisakatsu Oya in the quarter-final, Jinsei Shinzaki and Masaru Toi in the semi-final and Mr. Gannosuke and Tarzan Goto in the final to succeed in their block and then defeated Atsushi Onita and Katsutoshi Niiyama in the tournament final on January 18, 1994 to win the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship, marking Alfonso's first title in FMW.Mike Awesome career highlights They successfully defended the title against Atsushi Onita and Sambo Asako in a street fight on March 29 and then lost the title to Mr. Pogo and Hisakatsu Oya in their second title defense on April 21. The title loss created dissension between Titan and Gladiator. At 5th Anniversary Show, Gladiator, Titan and Fuji took on Fuyuki-Gun in a match, where Gladiator and Titan had a miscommunication with each other but they still managed to win their match but Gladiator abandoned his partners after the match to quietly end Team Canada. As a result, Gladiator began feuding with Titan and defeated him in their first singles match against each other on July 31. Gladiator won a rematch at Summer Spectacular, before finally losing to Titan on September 7 to end the rivalry. In October, Gladiator joined the new W*ING Alliance with Mr. Pogo, Mitsuhiro Matsunaga, Yukihiro Kanemura, Goro Tsurumi, Horace Boulder, Hideki Hosaka and Hisakatsu Oya. The group mostly consisted of wrestlers from the former W*ING promotion, who held Atsushi Onita and FMW responsible for ending the promotion and had formed the alliance to bring the demise of FMW just like W*ING suffered its demise. On October 28, Gladiator and Pogo defeated Atsushi Onita and Mr. Gannosuke to win the vacant Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. They lost the tag titles to Onita and Gannosuke in a rematch on February 24, 1995. At 6th Anniversary Show, Gladiator and Horace Boulder lost to Katsutoshi Niiyama and Masato Tanaka. Later at the event, Mr. Pogo turned on W*ING Alliance by blowing a fireball on Yukihiro Kanemura after Pogo and Kanemura lost their match, which led Gladiator, Boulder and Hisakatsu Oya to follow Pogo and join Lethal Weapon. Longest reigning world champion (1995-1997) The retirement of Atsushi Onita led FMW to change its direction from deathmatch wrestling to technical wrestling style and Gladiator received a strong push as the arch rival of the company's new top star Hayabusa. He was booked to win the Grand Slam Tournament in September, in which he defeated Hayabusa in the tournament final on September 26 to win the company's top title, the vacant Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and cemented his place as the company's top villain. Gladiator made his first successful title defense against Horace Boulder on October 25. He suffered a knee injury in the fall of 1995, which forced him to vacate the title on January 5, 1996.The Wrestling Gospel Mike Mooneyham 25 February 2007 Gladiator returned from injury to challenge Super Leather for the title on March 15, but was defeated by Leather. During this time, V√≠ctor Quinones' group Puerto Rican Army overturned W*ING and Lethal Weapon to become the top villainous group in FMW and Quinones was luring away members of both factions into his Puerto Rican Army, which led Gladiator to turn fan favorite for the first time in his career. At 7th Anniversary Show, Hisakatsu Oya, Horace Boulder and The Gladiator lost to Super Leather and The Headhunters in a match for the inaugural World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. On May 27, Gladiator defeated Super Leather to win his second Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship. Gladiator successfully defended the title against Leather in a rematch on September 1. On September 15, Gladiator and Horace Boulder turned on Ricky Fuji during a match against Hideki Hosaka, Hido and Taka Michinoku. The entire Lethal Weapon attacked Fuji and turned on him to join Terry Funk's new group Funk Masters of Wrestling, which led Gladiator to turn into a villain again. On October 12, Gladiator attacked W*ING Kanemura after Kanemura successfully defended the Independent Heavyweight Championship against Hisakatsu Oya and Gladiator challenged Kanemura to a title unification match for both Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and the Independent Heavyweight Championship at Year End Spectacular, which Gladiator won and unified both titles to become the first-ever FMW Double Champion. Gladiator successfully defended his Double Championship against Masato Tanaka on February 18, 1997. Gladiator would then resume his feud with the returning Atsushi Onita as the team of Gladiator, Terry Funk and Cactus Jack was defeated by Atsushi Onita, Masato Tanaka and W*ING Kanemura at 8th Anniversary Show on April 29. The following day, on April 30, Gladiator surpassed Atsushi Onita's fourth reign of 337 days to become the longest reigning Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion by having reigned for 338 days at that point. On August 5, Hisakatsu Oya, Mr. Gannosuke and The Gladiator defeated Fuyuki-Gun at a Fuyuki Army show to win the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to the team of Hayabusa, Koji Nakagawa and Masato Tanaka on August 31. At Kawasaki Legend: Fall Spectacular, Gladiator lost the Double Championship to Masato Tanaka, thus ending his Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship reign at 489 days and his Independent Heavyweight Championship reign at 291 days, making him the longest reigning Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion and the longest reigning Independent Heavyweight Champion. ZEN and departure (1997-1998) Following Terry Funk's departure from FMW, Funk Masters of Wrestling began to cripple as Atsushi Onita denounced himself as a FMW wrestler and formed ZEN on September 30, 1997 to feud with FMW. On October 21, Super Leather and The Gladiator lost a match to their former teammates Hisakatsu Oya and Mr. Gannosuke, after which Gladiator attacked Leather and officially ended Funk Masters of Wrestling. Later that night, Gladiator attacked Hayabusa after ZEN members defeated Hayabusa's team in the main event and then Gladiator raised the flag of ZEN and joined ZEN, which marked the first time in his career that he had become Atsushi Onita's ally after having feuded with him for the past seven years. Gladiator had lost his significance as a main event competitor after losing the Double Championship despite being the longest reigning champion and became a mid-card member of ZEN. The group turned fan favorites in the fall of 1997 when three of its members Mr. Gannosuke, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido turned on Atsushi Onita and left the group and they would form Team No Respect in 1998. In March, Gladiator participated in a tournament to determine the #1 contender for the Double Championship at 9th Anniversary Show. He defeated Hisakatsu Oya in the quarter-final and Yukihiro Kanemura in the semi-final to become the runner-up of the tournament as he lost to Hayabusa in the final. At FMW's first pay-per- view event FMW 9th Anniversary Show, Gladiator teamed with ZEN teammate Tetsuhiro Kuroda to take on TNR members Super Leather and Horace Boulder in a losing effort. Later at the event, Atsushi Onita lost a match to TNR member Kodo Fuyuki, which forced Onita to end ZEN. Gladiator became a free agent after ZEN's dissolution on May 5. Gladiator's last pay-per-view appearance in FMW was at the Welcome to the Darkside pay-per-view on August 22, where he defeated Naohiko Yamazaki, Yoshinori Sasaki and Mr. Pogo #2 in a gauntlet match. On August 26, Gladiator wrestled his last FMW match, in which he defeated longtime rival Super Leather. Alfonso injured his knee during the match and went on a hiatus, during which he returned to United States and toured with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) for the rest of the year. He left the company due to disagreement over Kodo Fuyuki's style of booking. =All Japan Pro Wrestling (1998‚Äì1999)= Alfonso wrestled as The Gladiator for a brief period in All Japan Pro Wrestling in 1998 and 1999. =Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993-1994, 1997, 1998, 1999‚Äì2000)= In 1993, Alfonso appeared in NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) for a short period (as \\"Awesome\\" Mike Awesome), he was convinced to do so by Sabu, whom he befriended during their time in Japan. After Sabu started working for ECW, he returned to Japan and told Michael about the promotion and how he should work there. Although he was initially hesitant, citing a lack of interest, Sabu managed to talk Alfonso into it, who used his frequent-flier miles to go to Philadelphia and wrestle a match for ECW.Loverro, Thom (2006). The Rise and Fall of ECW. Pocket Books. . p. 128 On February 5, 1994 at ECW's event, The Night the Line Was Crossed, Awesome nearly injured wrestler, J.T. Smith when he performed a high-risk dive to the outside of the ring. Smith's back was folded backwards against the guard rail during the impact. This spot appeared in many ECW highlight reels including the intro to a variety of their television programs for years to come. (according to ECW announcer Joey Styles his own reaction to the spot inspired his \\"Oh my God\\" catchphrase). In early 1997 he made a one night appearance in ECW with The Triple Threat in addressing The Masked Man (Rick Rude). In January 1998, Awesome began appearing for ECW again and continued his feud with Masato Tanaka in the United States. Awesome began in ECW by losing to Tanaka on an episode ECW's weekly Hardcore TV. However, following the match, he delivered an Awesome Bomb to Tanaka over the top rope through a table set up on the outside. In his final appearance of his second ECW stint, Awesome lost to Tanaka again at the August Heat Wave pay-per-view event. Almost immediately upon arriving in ECW for his third stint in September 1999, he shocked the wrestling world by winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Anarchy Rulz by defeating the reigning champion Taz and nemesis Masato Tanaka in a three-way dance, which was signed on the spot. Awesome continued to be a major factor in ECW early in 2000, including teaming with Raven to beat Tanaka and Tommy Dreamer for the ECW World Tag Team Championship. He gained a new manager, Judge Jeff Jones, who managed Awesome to the top of winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship twice in 1999. =World Championship Wrestling (2000‚Äì2001)= On April 10, 2000, Awesome made a surprise appearance on WCW Monday Nitro‚Äîaiding The New Blood by attacking Kevin Nash‚Äîwhile still reigning as ECW World Champion. Awesome's friend Lance Storm has said that he had refused to sign a new contract with ECW until Paul Heyman paid him overdue wages. Due to concerns over legal issues WCW refrained from having Awesome appear on their television shows with the ECW belt. Eventually, a compromise was reached. Awesome (a WCW employee and ECW champion) appeared a few days later at an ECW event in Indianapolis, Indiana, accompanied by WCW's head of security, where he lost the title to Tazz (a World Wrestling Federation employee), who lost it a week later to Tommy Dreamer (a full-time ECW wrestler) (who incidentally lost it approximately 20 minutes later to Justin Credible). In an shoot interview released by Highspots in 2005, Awesome expressed that he would have rather faced off with his former ECW and WWE colleague, Rhyno and suggested that they could have put on a more entertaining match regardless of the circumstances and the manner in which he had left ECW. Now with WCW, Awesome continued to be a major factor with the New Blood for the next month, teaming with Billy Kidman occasionally to aid him in his feud with Hulk Hogan. Awesome also engaged in an on-and-off feud with Kevin Nash, as well as feuding with Diamond Dallas Page and Kanyon. In May 2000, Awesome threw Kanyon off the top of the first level of a triple cage onto the entrance ramp, which started his \\"Career Killer\\" gimmick. During Mid 2000, his gimmick was tweaked, with him becoming infatuated with heavyset women and calling himself \\"The Fat Chick Thrilla\\" Mike Awesome, and feuded with Scott Steiner and Lance Storm for the WCW United States Championship. On the September 6, 2000 edition of Thunder, Awesome changed his gimmick and became \\"That '70s Guy\\" Mike Awesome (a reference to the hit TV series, That '70s Show), dressing in various 1970s inspired outfits and hosting the \\"Lava Lamp Lounge\\" interview segment. At one point, he was even given a bus painted in the style of the one featured on The Partridge Family to drive into arenas for his entrance. During this time, he had a feud with Vampiro, which created many brawls between Awesome and Vampiro's allies, the Insane Clown Posse. At one point, Awesome battled Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J in a Handicap match. At the conclusion of the match, Mike Awesome-Bombed Shaggy 2 Dope onto the roof of the bus. However, the slippery metal surface gave yield to Dope's lithe, supple frame and he fell tragically to the concrete below. On the January 3, 2001 edition of Thunder, Awesome dropped the 1970s gimmick in favor of a \\"Canadian Career Killer\\" gimmick and joined WCW's Team Canada stable with Lance Storm and Elix Skipper. A feud with The Filthy Animals led to Awesome challenging Billy Kidman to a Hair-vs-Hair match, on January 15, however before the bout could take place, Team Canada attacked Kidman backstage leaving him unable to compete. Konnan (who had no hair) took his place and got the win, giving the Animals the right to cut off Awesome's long-time mullet. Awesome then faded into the background, mostly helping Storm in his battles against Ernest \\"The Cat\\" Miller. On the final Nitro on March 26, 2001 Awesome and Storm were defeated by Chuck Palumbo and Sean O'Haire in a WCW World Tag Team Championship match. In an shoot interview released by Highspots in 2003, Awesome conspired that the infamous incident between Vince Russo and Hulk Hogan at Bash at the Beach 2000 may have been one of the underlying reasons as to why he was plagued by a string of unfavorable gimmicks. As a cousin of Michael Bollea (Horace Hogan, who also left WCW following the incident), Awesome suggested that Russo may have thought that he was just \\"too close of kin\\" to Hulk Hogan and decided to take it out on him. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001‚Äì2002)= After the March 2001 purchase of WCW by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Awesome became part of The Invasion storyline in the WWF. His WWF debut came on the June 25, 2001 episode of Raw during a match which saw Test defending his Hardcore Championship against Rhyno. After Rhyno Gored Test against a wall and pinned him he stood celebrating his new title only to be attacked by Awesome wielding a metal pipe. He then powerbombed Rhyno onto a ladder and pinned him, becoming champion himself due to the 24/7 rule. Awesome was the first \\"Invader\\" to gain gold in the WWF, stealing away with the Hardcore belt before any WWF wrestlers could catch him. Awesome's hardcore reign came to an end a few weeks later on the July 12 edition of SmackDown! when he was pinned by Jeff Hardy, thanks to distraction from Edge. Awesome defeated Edge on the July 16 episode of Raw. The feud continued when Edge introduced his tag team partner Christian into the rivalry. Awesome and Lance Storm were defeated by Edge and Christian at Invasion on July 22, Awesome's first WWF pay-per-view match. From here Awesome's push diminished and he began appearing mostly on WWF's b-shows, before being sidelined with an injury in November 2001. Awesome returned to the SmackDown! brand on the July 27, 2002 edition of Velocity where he was defeated by Tajiri. Awesome was a mainstay on Velocity, SmackDown!'s tertiary show, for the next few months jobbing to wrestlers such as Faarooq, Bull Buchanan, Mark Henry and Funaki. Awesome was released from the WWE on September 27, 2002 along with Shawn Stasiak and Horace Hogan. Awesome quoted saying \\"Being in the WWE (formerly the WWF) sucked. I hated it. You had to kiss everybody's ass... You had to be on your political toes all the time. You would not believe the backstage politics. You were getting stabbed in the back constantly. I was so happy when I was told I was gone [fired]\\". =Independent circuit (2002‚Äì2006)= From 2002 to 2006, Awesome competed on the independent circuit in the United States and Japan where he worked for All Japan Pro Wrestling as \\"The Gladiator\\" once again. On the independent circuit, he had a short stint with Major League Wrestling (MLW) where he won the MLW World Heavyweight Championship from Satoshi Kojima, only to lose it ten minutes later to Steve Corino (Kojima's employers, AJPW would not allow him to drop the title to an employee of a rival company Zero-1). In February 2006, after 17 years in the ring, Awesome announced his retirement from wrestling, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family and adding that he felt underpaid for his work at the One Night Stand event and that he would only return to the ring \\"if the money was right\\". =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003)= In April 2003, Awesome debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. He wrestled several matches for the promotion before leaving in May 2003. His TNA in-ring debut was on April 16, 2003 where Awesome defeated Perry Saturn by DQ when The Sandman and New Jack interfered. On April 23, Awesome teamed with Brian Lee and Slash in a losing effort against Perry Saturn, New Jack and the Sandman. On May 14, Awesome competed in his final TNA match where he lost to Mike Sanders in a Tables Match. =Return to WWE (2005)= Awesome made an appearance at WWE's (formerly the WWF) ECW One Night Stand reunion pay-per- view on June 13, 2005, defeating Masato Tanaka. The crowd greeted Awesome with jeers at the beginning of the match, but by the end were chanting \\"this match rules!\\" and gave both men a standing ovation. Other media Alfonso appeared in at least four wrestling video games including ECW Hardcore Revolution, WCW Backstage Assault, Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: ≈åd≈ç Keish≈ç, and Fire Pro Wrestling Returns. The ECW toy series manufactured by Original San Francisco Toymakers released a Mike Awesome action figure in 2000. A WCW action figure of Awesome was released by Toy Biz in 2001. Personal life Alfonso attended King High School in Tampa, Florida and trained at Stan's Gym, an old school muscle gym, on 56th Street. On May 11, 1991, he married his high school sweetheart Delisa Diann Bowers in Hillsborough, Florida.https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VNY5-N8Y They had two children together; son Casey (born 1996) and daughter Carissa (born 2000). Alfonso was an avid outdoorsman and enjoyed fishing and trail bike riding with friends and his son. He enjoyed mountain biking and would ride frequently at Alafia River State Park in Florida, close to his Tampa home. Alfonso was the cousin of Hulk Hogan's nephew Michael Bollea, who was better known for his stint in WCW under the name Horace Hogan. He is no relation of fellow ECW alumnus Bill Alfonso. After Awesome's retirement from professional wrestling, he served as a real estate agent in New Tampa, Florida. Death On February 17, 2007, a group of Alfonso's friends found him dead after he had hanged himself inside his Tampa home. He was 42 years old. WWE acknowledged his death on the February 20 broadcast of ECW on Sci-Fi with an \\"In Memory...\\" graphic at the opening of the program, and two days later his family received friends at Serenity Meadows Funeral Home in Riverview, Florida.

It was first published in August 1927, in the literary magazine transition, then later in the 1927 short story collection Men Without Women.  Synopsis  The story focuses on a conversation between an American man and a young woman, described as a \\"girl,\\" at a Spanish train station while waiting for a train to Madrid. The girl compares the nearby hills to white elephants. The pair indirectly discuss an \\"operation\\" that the man wants the girl to have, which is implied to be an abortion.  Analysis  While there is little context or background information about the characters, several scholars have analyzed how the setting influences the story. The expatriate atmosphere is ‚Äúa motivating factor in character action,‚Äù writes Jeffrey Herlihy in _In Paris or Paname: Hemingway‚Äôs Expatriate Nationalism_. Setting the piece in Spain ‚Äúdramatizes the peripatetic subject‚Äù and allows the man to discuss abortion outside the ‚Äúrestraints from the behavioral prescriptions of his place of origin.‚Äù This use of a foreign setting makes Spain not merely a background but ‚Äúa catalyst of textual irony‚Äù in the story. ‚Äù Readers must come to their own conclusions based on the dialogue. This has led to varying interpretations of the story. One point of debate is whether or not the woman decides to get an abortion. Critics like Stanley Renner assert that the details in the story imply that the woman decides to keep the baby: \\"The logic of the story's design enjoins the conclusion that she smiles brightly at the waitress's announcement of the train because she is no longer headed in the direction of having the abortion that she has contemplated only with intense distress\\". Other critics conclude that the woman ultimately decides to get an abortion. Furthermore, most critics acknowledge that the story has several possible interpretations: \\"The two organizing questions of the narrative‚Äîwill they have the abortion or the baby? Will they break up or stay together?‚Äîimply four possible outcomes: 1) they will have the abortion and break up; 2) they will have the abortion and stay together; 3) they will have the baby and break up; and 4) they will have the baby and stay together\\". There are many essays written which argue for all of these possibilities and more. There is no universal consensus because of the nature of the story; the reader is simply not given much information. = Symbolism = The description of the valley of Ebro, in the opening paragraph, is often seen as having deeper meanings: \\"It has long been recognized that the two sides of the valley of the Ebro represent two ways of life, one a sterile perpetuation of the aimless hedonism the couple have been pursuing, the other a participation in life in its full natural sense.\\" Critics also point to the various positions of the characters, with relation to the train tracks and the valley, to show a wide variety of possible symbolic interpretations. Doris Lanier writes about the significance of Absinthe (also called \\"Anis del Toro\\") in the story. She explains the drink \\"was alluring not only because of its narcotic effects but also because of its reputation as an aphrodisiac.\\" Lanier asserts that every detail in \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\" is intentionally placed by Hemingway, and the Absinthe could have several possible connotations. She postulates that \\"the addictive quality of the drink‚Ä¶is meant to emphasize the addictive nature of the couple's lifestyle‚Ä¶It is an empty, meaningless existence that revolves around traveling, sex, drinking, looking at things, and having pointless conversations about these things\\". Another possible interpretation of the Absinthe relates to its appeal and effects. Like the man and woman's relationship, it is alluring at first, but \\"It becomes a destroyer of the child, who is aborted; a destroyer of the girl, who endures the physical and emotional pain of aborting the child she wants; and a destroyer of the couple's relationship\\". It is important to note that this interpretation assumes the couple have the abortion and end their relationship, as well as that the young woman wants to continue the pregnancy; none of these are certain, due to the ambiguity of the story. The title \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\" is a symbol within Hemingway's short story that requires analysis to depict its meaning and relevance to the story as well. Repetition of words and phrases is a common trait found within Hemingway's short story, a habit that is not done without cause. This was done in an attempt to emphasize importance on certain matters, such as he does with the title of the story. Within the story, Hemingway makes \\"two references to the whiteness of the hills and four to them as white elephants\\". The most common belief as to the meaning of this reference has to do with color comparisons used throughout the story. In correlation with the drink \\"absinthe\\" as mentioned above, there is believed to be a contrast of joy and sorrow between the black licorice of the alcoholic drink and the whiteness of the hills. This can also be contrasted with the comparison between the white hills and the dry, brown countryside that represents the same joy and sorrow as the former. However, the true meaning of the title does not become fully known until the topic of getting an abortion is revealed between the couple, as the man states, it's an \\"awfully simple question... not really an operation at all... just to let the air in\\". It is then understood that the use of the term \\"white elephants\\" may in fact be a reference to the White elephant sale. It's a sale put together through the donation of unwanted gifts, making the reader believe that this may be correlating with the act of getting an abortion. It could also mean the literal translation of elephant in the room meaning something painfully obvious that is not to be spoken about or referenced. \\"Elephant in the room\\" is a term used mainly by couples having a relationship crisis or difficulty including break-ups, divorce, cheating, marriage, adoption, or abortion. This is viewed differently between the couple. The child is seen \\"as simply a white elephant to the man\\" to be rid of, whereas the woman only sees it as this due to the father's views. The final reference to the hills is when the girl contemplates on her decision of getting an abortion through the following line, \\"it will be nice again if I say things are like white elephants, and you'll like it?\\" This is to provide an immediate understanding of the white elephant reference when we learn that the story's conflict revolves around an unwanted pregnancy is associated with the ubiquitous white elephant sale. These sales raise money that is worthwhile cause for people to donate unwanted objects. This is shown in Hills Like White Elephants as the to the man, the girl is a white elephant with the child. Weeks Jr., Lewis E. ‚ÄúHemingway Hills: Symbolism in ‚ÄòHills Like White Elephants.‚Äô‚Äù Studies in Short Fiction, vol. 17, no. 1, Winter 1980, p. 75. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=aph&AN;=7134801&site;=ehost- live. Another important symbol in the story is the bamboo curtain. Many interpretations see the curtain as a barrier between Jig and the American. Literally, the curtain is a barrier between the American and the girl while he drinks in the bar among other ‚Äúreasonable people‚Äù while the girl sits outside. Figuratively, the beaded curtain separates Jig, a sensitive girl who notices and touches the beads from the American who only acknowledges the drink advertisement and pays no more attention to the curtain than the hills. David Gilmore points out that the bead curtain has an even more specific symbolism. When Jig takes hold of two strands, the American believes that she views them as a rosary, giving a clue to Jig being Catholic. Gilmore goes on to state that any leap to thinking of Spain, Catholicism, and the abortion as connected ideas is a stretch and if Jig were praying, she would most likely be praying to turn back time so that she may not be entangled with the American. This belief is supported when she states, while holding the two strands, that she wants things to be as they were before. In contrast, Gary Elliott writes that the beaded curtain and its similarity to a rosary lends insight to the girl‚Äôs reluctance to go through with the abortion and is almost certainly indicative of her Catholic background. He goes on to say that while the curtain is a physical barrier between the two, it is really her religion, symbolized by the beads, that separates them. Dialogue > \\"They look like white elephants,\\" she said. > \\"I've never seen one,\\" the man drank his beer. > \\"No, you wouldn't have.\\" > \\"I might have,\\" the man said. \\"Just because you say I wouldn't have doesn't > prove anything.\\" > The girl looked at the bead curtain. \\"They've painted something on it,\\" she > said. \\"What does it say?\\" > \\"Anis del Toro. It's a drink.\\" > \\"Can we try it?\\" The reader must interpret their dialogue and body language to infer their backgrounds and their attitudes with respect to the situation at hand, and their attitudes toward one another. From the outset of the story, the contentious nature of the couple's conversation indicates resentment and unease. Some critics have written that the dialogue is a distillation of the contrasts between stereotypical male and female relationship roles: in the excerpt above, for instance, the woman draws the comparison with white elephants, but the hyper-rational male immediately denies it, dissolving the bit of poetry into objective realism with \\"I've never seen one.\\" By saying, \\"No, you wouldn't have\\" she implies he hadn't had a child before, or hadn't allowed birth in the past. She also asks his permission to order a drink. Throughout the story, the woman is distant; the American is rational.Smiley, P. \\"Gender-linked Miscommunication in 'Hills Like White Elephants.'\\" Hemingway Review, Fall 1988. Vol. 8 No. 1. p. 2 There may be more serious problems with the relationship than the purely circumstantial. Though the immediate problem is the unwanted pregnancy, the experience has revealed that the relationship is a shallow one. While most critics have espoused relatively straightforward interpretations of the dialogue, a few have argued for alternate scenarios.  Reception  \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\" has been criticized for being anti- feminist; it has also been interpreted as being pro-feminist. The anti- feminist perspective emphasizes the notion that the man dominates the woman in the story, and she ultimately succumbs to his will by getting the abortion. Frederick Busch asserts that the woman \\"'buries her way of seeing as she will bury her child.'\\" However, critics also argue that the female character makes her own decision in the end, and the story is actually pro-feminist. Stanley Renner claims that \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\" is primarily empathetic towards the female character: \\"So firmly does the story's sympathy side with the girl and her values, so strong is her repugnance toward the idea of abortion, and so critical is the story of the male's self-serving reluctance to shoulder the responsibility of the child he has begotten that the reading I have proposed seems the most logical resolution to its conflict.\\" However, the findings by Doris Lanier describe that the drink that the woman has known as \\"absinthe\\" is a narcotic that the man uses to influence the woman's mind.

Heath Robinson Professor Branestawm is a series of thirteen books written by the English author Norman Hunter. Written over a 50-year period, between 1933 and 1983, the children's books feature as protagonist the eponymous inventor, Professor Theophilus Branestawm, who is depicted throughout the books as the archetypal absent- minded professor. The name \\"Branestawm\\" is a pun, as a pseudo-homophone of the word \\"brainstorm\\". The first two books in the series were originally published in the 1930s, with the other 11 books published much later from 1970, during Hunter's retirement. As such, there is a 33-year gap between the publication of Hunter's second Branestawm novel, Professor Branestawm's Treasure Hunt (1937), and his third, The Peculiar Triumph of Professor Branestawm (1970). Characters Professor Branestawm is always at work in his \\"Inventory\\" creating bizarre inventions, all of which either malfunction or work in unanticipated ways, and which lead him into incredible adventures, often accompanied by his friend Colonel Dedshott of the Catapult Cavaliers (soldiers who use catapults as their only weapon), and his housekeeper Mrs Flittersnoop. He lives in Great Pagwell, which is apparently surrounded by other Pagwells (Little Pagwell, Pagwell Heights, Pagwell Gardens, Lower Pagwell, Upper Pagwell, Pagwell Green, Pagwell Centre, Pagwell Market, Pagwell Docks etc.). In \\"The Professor Borrows a Book\\", he manages to lose fourteen different copies of the same book from fourteen different public libraries, and has to cycle frantically between fourteen different Pagwells to renew his books to avoid being fined. In \\"The Fair at Pagwell Green\\", the Professor is mistaken for a waxwork, only because of Colonel Dedshott. The Colonel thought the waxwork to be a frozen professor, so he and Mrs Flittersnoop heated it, melting the waxwork. Meanwhile, the Professor was covered along with all the waxworks when he was lost in thought. He suddenly stopped thinking and when trying to get out of the fair, was thought to be a living waxwork. The Professor is described in the first book as having, like all great men, simple tastes: \\"His coat was simply fastened with safety pins because the buttons had simply fallen off. His head was simply bald and it simply shone like anything when the sun caught it.\\" He has five pairs of spectacles ‚Äì one for reading, one for writing, one for out of doors, one for looking at you over the top of and a fifth pair for looking for the others on the frequent occasions when they get lost. Other pairs of spectacles are often mentioned. Mrs Flittersnoop, his housekeeper, causes trouble a few times through her lack of understanding for the Professor's genius. In \\"The Wild Waste Paper\\", she throws what seems to be a bottle of cough medicine into the waste bin. The liquid turns out to be the Professor's elixir of life, which was in the bottle because cough medicine is the only thing that can stop the stuff dead without actually destroying it. Since the bottle was uncorked to allow air in (nothing can live without air), the waste paper in the bin comes to life. Even when stuck up a pear tree surrounded by giant, predatory bits of waste paper, the Professor retains his scientific detachment, wondering if a carpenter's bill would know a saw if it saw one, and if so, whether the gas bill might explode at any moment. The names of other characters in the books, like the Professor's, are puns: * Mrs Flittersnoop ‚Äì the Professor's housekeeper * Colonel Dedshott ‚Äì his best friend * General Shatterfortz ‚Äì the Colonel's commanding officer * Commander Hardaport (Retired) ‚Äì a neighbour of the Professor's * Mr Chintzbitz ‚Äì a friend of the Colonel's who owns a furniture shop * Dr Mumpzanmeasle ‚Äì the local doctor Plot devices Many of the Professor's perils result from simple absent-mindedness. In \\"The Screaming Clocks\\", he invents a clock that doesn't need winding up, but the omission of an important component (\\"I forgot to put a little wiggly thing in\\") means the clock doesn't stop at twelve but continues striking thirteen, fourteen and so forth until it can't keep up with itself. In \\"Burglars!\\", the Professor invents an automatic burglar catcher, but forgets his house key, tries to get in the window and is grabbed and trussed up by his own machine so thoroughly that even Mrs Flittersnoop fails to recognise him and bashes him over the head for good measure. Many of the troubles that the professor experiences are the result of his inventions' rebelling and showing anthropomorphic personalities. For instance, the phrase \\"No Branestawm invention was going to stand for that\\" occurs several times in the series. Branestawm inventions frequently object to anyone's using them in ways for which they were not designed. For instance, in a story about the Professor's making cuckoo clocks for all his friends, a fight broke out between the clocks, resulting in the destruction of all of them. Illustrators George Adamson The first book featuring Professor Branestawm was The Incredible Adventures of Professor Branestawm, first published in 1933 and illustrated by W. Heath Robinson. Heath Robinson was famous for his rickety contraptions, and the illustrations were a perfect foil to the outlandish plots of these short stories, each picture typically featuring the professor's unfeasibly large forehead. The original book contained a section called seventy-six illustrations by W. Heath Robinson, each with evocative titles such as A telescope of his own invention or With nothing on at all but a big smile (referring to a picture of an extra specially young professor). The sequel was Professor Branestawm's Treasure Hunt, published 1937. The first edition was illustrated by James Arnold, with George Adamson illustrating the 1966 reissue.George W. Adamson website Adamson went on to illustrate The Peculiar Triumph of Professor Branestawm, Professor Branestawm up the Pole and the Puffin edition of Professor Branestawm's Great Revolution, as well as a Branestawm story in the Puffin Annual and two in Puffin Post. The Peculiar Triumph of Professor Branestawm with Adamson's illustrations was reissued by Red Fox Classics (Random House) in 2003.

In 2014, a BBC hour-long television film adaptation of Hunter's books, written by Charlie Higson and starring Harry Hill as Professor Branestawm, was broadcast on Christmas Eve. Filming for this took place in Shere, Surrey in early October 2014, then Wallingford in mid October, and included David Mitchell, Simon Day, Ben Miller and Miranda Richardson. In 2015, a sequel, also an hour-long, entitled Professor Branestawm Returns aired on Christmas Eve at 5.20pm on BBC One.

In baseball, a pitcher can commit a number of illegal motions or actions that constitute a balk. Most of these violations involve a pitcher pretending to pitch when he has no intention of doing so. In games played under the Official Baseball Rules that govern professional play in the United States and Canada, a balk results in a dead ball or delayed dead ball. In certain other circumstances, a balk may be wholly or partially disregarded. Under other rule sets, notably in the United States under the National Federation of High Schools Baseball Rules, a balk results in an immediate dead ball. In the event a balk is enforced, the pitch is generally (but not always) nullified, each runner is awarded one base, and the batter (generally) remains at bat, and with the previous count. The balk rule in Major League Baseball was introduced in 1898.Baseball Rules Chronology: 1845-1899 BaseballLibrary.com Balk actions A pitcher is restricted to a certain set of motions and one of two basic pitching positions before and during a pitch. If these regulations are violated with one or more runners on base, an umpire may call a balk. The batter at home plate does not advance on a balk. With a runner on base and the pitcher on or astride (with one leg on each side of) the rubber, under Official Baseball Rules, it is a balkThe Official Site of Major League Baseball: Official info: Official Rules when the pitcher: * Switches his pitching position from the windup to the set (or vice versa) without properly disengaging the rubber * While on the rubber, makes a motion associated with his pitch and does not complete the delivery * When pitching from the set position, fails to make a complete stop with his hands together before beginning to pitch * Throws from the mound to a base without stepping toward (gaining distance in the direction of that base) * Throws or feints a throw from the rubber to an unoccupied base, unless a play is imminent * Steps or feints from the rubber to first base without completing the throw * Delivers a quick return, a pitch thrown right after receiving the ball back, with intent to catch the batter off-guard * Drops the ball while on the rubber, even if by accident, if the ball does not subsequently cross a foul line * While intentionally walking a batter, releases a pitch while the catcher is out of his box with one or both feet * Unnecessarily delays the game * Pitches while facing away from the batter * After bringing his hands together on the rubber, separates them except in making a pitch or a throw * Stands on or astride the rubber without the ball, or mimics a pitch without the ball * Attempts to throw to a fielder in a spot not directly at a base * Delivers a pitch during a squeeze play or a steal of home, if the catcher or some other player steps on or in front of home plate without possession of the ball, or touches the batter or his bat. The ball is dead, the batter is awarded first base, the pitcher is charged with a balk, and the run scores Balk rules under other rule sets vary. The pitcher's acts of spitting on the ball, defacing or altering the ball, rubbing the ball on the clothing or body, or applying a foreign substance to the ball are not balks; however, it will result in the pitcher's ejection from the game if caught. Clarifications A pitcher was allowed to feint toward third (or second) base, and then turn and throw or feint to first base if his pivot foot disengages the rubber after his initial feint. This is called the \\"fake to third, throw to first\\" play. However, Major League Baseball classified this as a balk beginning with the 2013 season. If no runners are on base and the pitcher commits an otherwise balkable action, there generally is no penalty. However, delivering a quick return or pitching while off the rubber (which constitute balks when runners are on base) results in a ball being called with the bases empty. If the pitcher should commit an act confusing to the batter with nobody on, or if he stops his delivery or otherwise violates because the batter steps out or otherwise acts confusingly, time is called and the play restarted without penalty (whether or not runners are on base). If a pitcher repeatedly commits illegal actions without runners on base, he may be subject to ejection for persistently violating the rules. If, during an attempt to execute the \\"hidden ball trick\\" (where the defensive team deceives the runner(s) as to the ball's location while the play is live), the pitcher stands on the rubber prior to the fielder revealing the ball and applying the tag, the runner is not out. Instead, it is a balk, with all runners on base being awarded their next base. Common misconceptions \\"Catcher's balk\\" is not a term in the official rules, but is sometimes used to describe the infrequent situation when the catcher is not completely within the catcher's box when the pitcher releases the ball in his delivery during an intentional walk.Umpires: Feature MLB.com: Official info The balk is still charged to the pitcher, because such a pitch is defined as a \\"Pitcher Illegal Action.\\"\\"Official Baseball Rules 2018 Edition\\" Major League Baseball. Retrieved July 31, 2018 A pitcher is not required to step off the rubber before throwing to an occupied base in a pick- off attempt. With his foot on the rubber in either the windup position or the \\"set\\" position, the pitcher may either: 1) deliver the ball to the batter: 2) throw to a base for a pickoff; or 3) step off the rubber. MLB rules state that: \\"Pitchers shall take signs from the catcher while in contact with the pitcher‚Äôs plate\\" (the rubber), but the rules do not describe the infraction as a balk. Major League Baseball balk records Steve Carlton had 90 balks during his major league career.Baseball-Reference.com - Steve Carlton The major league record in a single season is held by Dave Stewart, who had 16 balks in 1988 while pitching for the Oakland Athletics.Baseball-Reference.com - Dave Stewart The major league record for the most balks in one game is held by Bob Shaw, who had five balks in a May 4, 1963, game while pitching for the Milwaukee Braves against the Chicago Cubs. Four of the five balks came when the Cubs' Billy Williams was on base: one in the first inning, then three more in the third inning. In the latter frame, Shaw walked Williams, and then proceeded to balk him to second, third and home.May 4, 1963 Chicago Cubs at Milwaukee Braves Box Score and Play by Play - Baseball-Reference.com Shaw's balks were blamed on his difficulty adjusting to a then-new point of emphasis in the rules: umpires were told to enforce the section of the balk rule strictly that required the pitcher, when going from the stretch to the set position, to come to a complete stop with his hands together for one full second before pitching. The rule had been virtually ignored before. Knuckleballer Charlie Hough was once called for nine balks in a single major league exhibition game, occurring in March 1988. Hough was called for seven balks in a single inning of the game, as umpires set out to \\"enforce a full set position\\" for the coming season. Notable balks During the 1947 World Series (New York Yankees vs. Brooklyn Dodgers) Spec Shea dropped the ball trying to pick off Jackie Robinson at first base; after at least one other attempt, he dropped the ball and umpire Babe Pinelli waved Robinson to second base. https://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/yr1947ws.shtml A famous balk came in the first All-Star Game of 1961, when strong winds at Candlestick Park caused pitcher Stu Miller to sway erratically and be called for a balk. This story is often exaggerated in re-tellings of baseball lore, some having Miller being blown off the pitching mound. The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Texas Rangers on June 18, 2015, when Rangers relief pitcher Keone Kela committed a balk in the bottom of the ninth inning of a tie game with Dodger Enrique Hern√°ndez at third base. There have been at least 21 such walk-off balks (or \\"balk-offs\\") in major league history since 1914. On June 14, 2019, Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen intentionally balked during a game with the Chicago Cubs. With the Dodgers leading, 5‚Äì3, and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, the Cubs' Jason Heyward was on second base. Concerned that a runner at second base could possibly steal signs, Jansen intentionally balked, advancing the runner to third base. Jansen then struck out batter V√≠ctor Caratini for the final out of the game.

He is best remembered for his career in the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE), where he performed as Brian Christopher and Grand Master Sexay. Lawler was a one-time WWF Tag Team Champion as part of Too Cool with Scotty 2 Hotty, and won 44 titles within the United States Wrestling Association, the promotion formerly co-owned by his father, professional wrestler Jerry Lawler.  Professional wrestling career  = United States Wrestling Association (1988‚Äì1997) = Lawler began his career as one half of the masked tag team \\"The Twilight Zone\\" with Tony Williams under the individual ring names of Nebula (Lawler) and Quasar (Williams). After they were unmasked, Brian continued to wrestle in the United States Wrestling Association under the name \\"Too Sexy\\" Brian Christopher. He feuded with wrestlers such as Jeff Jarrett, Bill Dundee, Tom Prichard, and The Moondogs, and his father Jerry Lawler. Among his partners were Tony Williams (as the New Kids), Doug Gilbert, Scotty Flamingo, and \\"Hot Stuff\\" Eddie Gilbert. = World Wrestling Federation (1997‚Äì2001) = Lawler, still known as Brian Christopher, joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1997 and began competing in the light heavyweight division. Taka Michinoku defeated him in the finals of a tournament for the Light Heavyweight Championship. In mid-1998, he started teaming up with Scott \\"Too Hot\\" Taylor to form the tag team Too Much. When he was known as Brian Christopher, his father Jerry Lawler would talk him up as being superior to all the other Light Heavyweights but never publicly acknowledged that Brian was his son, although after Paul Heyman revealed that fact on Raw, Jim Ross (Jerry's broadcast partner) always hinted at it. Often a running joke was that someone (usually a commentator) would mention their relationship, which led to both of them adamantly denying that they were related. Lawler as Grandmaster Sexay (left) with Scotty 2 Hotty as Too Cool in 1999 On the June 13, 1999, episode of Heat, Brian and Scott adopted the ring names Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty, returning after a hiatus. Their tag team was renamed Too Cool, and they were later joined by Rikishi. They defeated Edge and Christian in May 2000 on Raw to become the Tag Team Champions. They were even occasionally involved with top-card feuds, notably being enemies to the McMahon-Helmsley Faction and their associates, such as The Radicalz, Edge and Christian, and T & A. The trio's run ended in late 2000 when Rikishi was revealed as the man behind the wheel of the car that hit Stone Cold Steve Austin at Survivor Series. Shortly after, Rikishi turned on his teammates. While Scotty was sidelined in 2001 with a broken ankle, Lawler formed a short-lived tag team with Steve Blackman and was later released from the company for illegally conveying drugs across the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. = Later career (2002‚Äì2011) = On February 24, 2002, at the second World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) pay per view in Las Vegas, Lawler wrestled WWA Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett for the title, but lost. In April 2002, Lawler wrestled in a fatal-four-way match for the championship at a house show but lost to Nathan Jones, Scott Steiner and Jarrett. From June 2002 until April 2004, he worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling as Brian Lawler. He formed a group called Next Generation with fellow second generation stars David Flair and Erik Watts. They were involved in a rivalry with Dusty Rhodes and harassed him with a replica of the NWA World Title belt that he wore when he was champion. In April 2004, Lawler was signed back to the WWE roster as Jim Ross's last act as head of WWE Talent Relations. He only appeared in four matches: against Kane, Wavell Starr, Christian, and Garrison Cade. He was later released after only one month with the company after John Laurinaitis took over as head of WWE Talent Relations. Prior to his release, Lawler was scheduled to take part in a Battle Royal for the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, but he was replaced by Maven. After his departure from WWE, Lawler wrestled for several independent promotions, including Memphis Wrestling and UWF Live. Christopher usually worked with his teammates Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty, making several reunions of Too Cool. = Sporadic WWE appearances (2011, 2014)= On the March 14, 2011 episode of Raw, Lawler returned to the WWE as a heel in a segment between Michael Cole and his father, Jerry Lawler, where Brian would side with Cole, saying that he felt that Jerry never cared for him and that he was ashamed to be his son. Lawler indirectly agreed, telling Brian that he was a bigger screw-up than Charlie Sheen. Lawler returned to the WWE on January 6, 2014, appearing on the \\"Old School\\" edition of Raw and reuniting with Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty, for what would be the final time, to take on 3MB in a six-man tag team match. His team was successful in winning. He made what would be his final WWE appearance, on NXT Arrival in February 2014 as part of Too Cool in a losing effort as mystery opponents to The Ascension, who defended their NXT Tag Team Championship. Personal life Lawler was a Pittsburgh Steelers fan, in stark contrast to his father, a diehard Cleveland Browns fan. According to his brother Kevin, Lawler was buried in a Steelers-themed casket with his ring name. =Legal issues= Lawler was arrested in February 2009 for disorderly conduct. On June 26, 2009, he was arrested for public intoxication just before 3 a.m. According to the police report, he \\"became very belligerent\\" once in custody and threatened the police officer who arrested him. On July 13, 2009, he was jailed for 30 days after failing to attend an in-patient treatment center as part of his plea agreement. Death Around 1 a.m. on July 7, 2018, Lawler was again jailed for driving under the influence, and for evading police.{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2018/07/24/wwe-grandmaster-sexay- arrested-dui-brian-christopher-lawler/ On the early morning of July 29, 2018, Lawler was found hanging in a cell at the Hardeman County Jail and was observed to be brain dead. His life support was disabled after his father Jerry Lawler had arrived to the hospital to bid his farewell. Lawler was pronounced dead at around 4:40 p.m. EST at the age of 46. On the one year anniversary of his death, Jerry Lawler filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Hardeman County, Hardeman County Sheriff John Doolen and others for allegedly failing to protect Lawler.

Her solo career has produced ten No. 1 radio singles, two No. 1 Billboard Jazz CDs, and four more solo CDs that have landed No. 5 and above on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Charts. She was the featured saxophonist for the 2011 and 2012 seasons of American Idol, and performed with the rock band Aerosmith. Abair's recordings have twice been nominated for Grammy Awards.  Early life  She acted as drum major of her high school marching band in her junior and senior years at Northside Christian School in St. Petersburg. As a senior in high school, she won the first chair alto saxophone for the Florida All-State Jazz Band. Abair spent her first year of college on a full scholarship at the University of North Florida, a jazz program started by Rich Matteson. She transferred to Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, attending on a scholarship and studying saxophone with Joe Viola and George Garzone. Abair graduated magna cum laude in 1991 with a degree in Woodwind Performance. She formed her first band in college.  Career  = Performances and releases = In 1991, after college, Abair moved to Los Angeles, California, where she began booking her band into clubs, coffee shops and hotels. She played solo on the street at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, California and garnered the attention of jazz keyboardist Bobby Lyle, who hired her to record on his Power of Touch CD and tour with him. Her touring opportunities expanded over the next decade, as she toured as a saxophonist/singer and keyboardist with Adam Sandler, John Tesh, Jonathan Butler, Teena Marie, Rick Braun as well. Abair was featured on saxophone in the Go West video \\"Tell Me\\". In 1996, she appeared on Adam Sandler's HBO Special and recorded on his platinum CD What's Your Name? playing the saxophone solo on \\"The Lonesome Kicker\\" and singing on various tracks. In 1999, Abair joined the Backstreet Boys for their Millennium World Tour, and spent the next year and a half as their saxophonist, keyboardist and percussionist. She assembled Mandy Moore's first band and acted as musical director, keyboardist, background singer and percussionist for many of Moore's first television appearances and shows. When not touring, Abair released her first complete solo album, Always and Never the Same, an all-vocal pop record, independently. Abair performed in local Los Angeles rock clubs to promote the record, in addition to her touring with the Backstreet Boys. In 2003, Abair signed to Verve Records and released the album It Just Happens That Way, which peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart. In 2004, Abair released Come As You Are, which peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz charts. She followed that with Life Less Ordinary in 2006, which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart and remained in the top 20 for 45 weeks. Her songs \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Bloom\\" hit No. 1 on R&R.; Abair signed to Concord Records in 2007 and released her genre breaking Stars in 2008 which peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart. Her single \\"Stars\\" (co-written and produced by Matthew Hager) charted at No. 29 Adult Contemporary R&R; simultaneously with her single \\"Smile\\" which reached No. 1 on the R&R; jazz airplay charts. She released \\"Hi-Fi Stereo\\" in 2010 which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. The album spawned the No. 1 hit \\"Be Beautiful\\" written by David Ryan Harris. The album Summer Horns, a collaboration with Dave Koz, Gerald Albright, and Richard Elliot, was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards. On May 27, 2014, Abair released Wild Heart on Concord Records imprint, Heads Up International. The record debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Jazz chart and No. 152 on the Billboard Top 200. The record, which included collaborations with the late Gregg Allman, Joe Perry and Trombone Shorty, was nominated for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album in the 2015 Grammy Awards. Abair received the Mad Skills Award at the third annual She Rocks at NAMM Show (organized by NAMM, the National Association of Music Merchants) on January 24, 2015. Held in Anaheim, California, the event was founded by the Women's International Music Network. In 2015, after working with Randy Jacobs (founder of The Boneshakers) on the tour for Wild Heart, he and Abair decided to form Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers, which includes Mindi Abair (saxophone, vocals), Randy Jacobs (guitar, vocals), Sweet Pea Atkinson (vocals), Rodney Lee (keyboards), Derek Frank (bass, vocals), and Third Richardson (drums, vocals). In late 2015, they released a live album Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers Live in Seattle via Pledge Music and HeadsUp, which featured a performance from Seattle's Dimitriou's Jazz Alley in February 2015. In summer 2017, the group announced their first studio project via Randy Jacobs' website. Recorded over five days at EastWest Studios with producer Kevin Shirley,The EastWest Sessions, included 11 blues and rock tracks, was released on September 15, 2017. Joe Bonamassa and Fantastic Negrito were featured guests. The album debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Blues Albums Chart on the week of October 7, 2017. \\"Pretty Good for a Girl,\\" a tongue-in-cheek track co-written by Abair and Jacobs for the album, inspired Abair to launch the web platform PrettyGoodForAGirl.net. The goal of the website is to celebrate exceptional women and turn \\"pretty good for a girl\\" into a phrase of empowerment. In October 2018, Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers released their first blues rock holiday album, All I Got For Christmas Is The Blues. It debuted at number 7 on the Billboard Blues Albums Chart, number 1 on the RMR Holiday Album and Song Chart and number 13 on Sirius XM Bluesville. It featured four original songs including \\"All I Got For Christmas Is The Blues\\" and five holiday classics including \\"Merry Christmas Baby\\" and \\"The Christmas Song\\". In June 2019, Abair and The Boneshakers released No Good Deed. It debuted at number 3 in the Billboard Blues Albums Chart. = Radio host = In 2007, Abair took over the nationally syndicated radio program Chill with Chris Botti which he had hosted for two years. The name changed to \\"Chill With Mindi Abair,\\" which she hosted from 2007 to 2015. The focus of the program was chill out music. = Television appearances = Abair featured on the 2011 American Idol season as a soloist with Paul McDonald and Casey Abrams and playing behind contestants Jacob Lusk and Haley Reinhart. Steven Tyler remarked to McDonald after her debut on the show \\"Forget you, who's your sax player?\\" Abair was featured on the 2012 American Idol season, performing with Phillip Phillips. Abair appeared with Phillips six times as a featured saxophonist, performing the songs \\"U Got It Bad\\" originally by Usher, \\"Disease\\" originally by Matchbox Twenty, \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\\" originally by Creedence Clearwater Revival, \\"Movin' Out\\" originally by Billy Joel, \\"In The Midnight Hour\\" originally by Wilson Pickett and \\"Give A Little More\\" originally by Maroon 5. Tyler was so impressed with Abair that he invited her to join Aerosmith on the summer leg of their 2012 world tour playing sax and singing backing vocals. She filled in as the saxophonist with the CBS Orchestra on the Late Show with David Letterman on April 3 and 4, 2012. She sat in with the band again on July 29, 2014, and she also performed her original songs \\"Wild Heart\\" and \\"Train.\\" Abair has also appeared on The Tavis Smiley Show and more than once on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.  Other ventures  = National Academy of Recording Arts And Sciences = In 2009, Abair was elected as a Governor on the Board of the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, serving for three years until 2012, when she was elected as Secretary. She spent one year serving as Secretary. In 2013, Abair was elected to a two-year term as the President of the Los Angeles Chapter, taking over the position from the previous president, MC Lyte. Mindi was elected to a two- year term as National Trustee of the Recording Academy in 2015.

BA41(red) and BA42(green) are auditory cortex. BA22(yellow) is Brodmann area 22, HF(blue) is hippocampal formation and pSTG is posterior part of superior temporal gyrus. The auditory cortex is the part of the temporal lobe that processes auditory information in humans and many other vertebrates. It is a part of the auditory system, performing basic and higher functions in hearing, such as possible relations to language switching.Cf. Pickles, James O. (2012). An Introduction to the Physiology of Hearing (4th ed.). Bingley, UK: Emerald Group Publishing Limited, p. 238. It is located bilaterally, roughly at the upper sides of the temporal lobes ‚Äì in humans, curving down and onto the medial surface, on the superior temporal plane, within the lateral sulcus and comprising parts of the transverse temporal gyri, and the superior temporal gyrus, including the planum polare and planum temporale (roughly Brodmann areas 41 and 42, and partially 22).Cf. Pickles, James O. (2012). An Introduction to the Physiology of Hearing (4th ed.). Bingley, UK: Emerald Group Publishing Limited, pp. 215‚Äì217. The auditory cortex takes part in the spectrotemporal, meaning involving time and frequency, analysis of the inputs passed on from the ear. The cortex then filters and passes on the information to the dual stream of speech processing. The auditory cortex's function may help explain why particular brain damage leads to particular outcomes. For example, unilateral destruction, in a region of the auditory pathway above the cochlear nucleus, results in slight hearing loss, whereas bilateral destruction results in cortical deafness. Structure The auditory cortex was previously subdivided into primary (A1) and secondary (A2) projection areas and further association areas. The modern divisions of the auditory cortex are the core (which includes primary auditory cortex, A1), the belt (secondary auditory cortex, A2), and the parabelt (tertiary auditory cortex, A3). The belt is the area immediately surrounding the core; the parabelt is adjacent to the lateral side of the belt.Cf. Pickles, James O. (2012). An Introduction to the Physiology of Hearing (4th ed.). Bingley, UK: Emerald Group Publishing Limited, p. 211 f. Besides receiving input from the ears via lower parts of the auditory system, it also transmits signals back to these areas and is interconnected with other parts of the cerebral cortex. Within the core (A1), its structure preserves tonotopy, the orderly representation of frequency, due to its ability to map low to high frequencies corresponding to the apex and base, respectively, of the cochlea. Data about the auditory cortex has been obtained through studies in rodents, cats, macaques, and other animals. In humans, the structure and function of the auditory cortex has been studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocorticography. =Development= Like many areas in the neocortex, the functional properties of the adult primary auditory cortex (A1) are highly dependent on the sounds encountered early in life. This has been best studied using animal models, especially cats and rats. In the rat, exposure to a single frequency during postnatal day (P) 11 to 13 can cause a 2-fold expansion in the representation of that frequency in A1. Importantly, the change is persistent, in that it lasts throughout the animal's life, and specific, in that the same exposure outside of that period causes no lasting change in the tonotopy of A1. Sexual dimorphism within the auditory cortex can be seen in humans between males in females through the planum temporale, encompassing Wernicke's region, for the planum temporale within males has been observed to have a larger planum temporale volume on average, reflecting previous studies discussing interactions between sex hormones and asymmetrical brain development.  Function  As with other primary sensory cortical areas, auditory sensations reach perception only if received and processed by a cortical area. Evidence for this comes from lesion studies in human patients who have sustained damage to cortical areas through tumors or strokes, or from animal experiments in which cortical areas were deactivated by surgical lesions or other methods. Damage to the auditory cortex in humans leads to a loss of any awareness of sound, but an ability to react reflexively to sounds remains as there is a great deal of subcortical processing in the auditory brainstem and midbrain. Neurons in the auditory cortex are organized according to the frequency of sound to which they respond best. Neurons at one end of the auditory cortex respond best to low frequencies; neurons at the other respond best to high frequencies. There are multiple auditory areas (much like the multiple areas in the visual cortex), which can be distinguished anatomically and on the basis that they contain a complete \\"frequency map.\\" The purpose of this frequency map (known as a tonotopic map) likely reflects the fact that the cochlea is arranged according to sound frequency. The auditory cortex is involved in tasks such as identifying and segregating \\"auditory objects\\" and identifying the location of a sound in space. For example, it has been shown that A1 encodes complex and abstract aspects of auditory stimuli without encoding their \\"raw\\" aspects like frequency content, presence of a distinct sound or its echoes. Human brain scans indicated that a peripheral part of this brain region is active when trying to identify musical pitch. Individual cells consistently get excited by sounds at specific frequencies, or multiples of that frequency. The auditory cortex plays an important yet ambiguous role in hearing. When the auditory information passes into the cortex, the specifics of what exactly takes place are unclear. There is a large degree of individual variation in the auditory cortex, as noted by English biologist James Beament, who wrote, ‚ÄúThe cortex is so complex that the most we may ever hope for is to understand it in principle, since the evidence we already have suggests that no two cortices work in precisely the same way.\\" In the hearing process, multiple sounds are transduced simultaneously. The role of the auditory system is to decide which components form the sound link. Many have surmised that this linkage is based on the location of sounds. However, there are numerous distortions of sound when reflected off different media, which makes this thinking unlikely. The auditory cortex forms groupings based on fundamentals; in music, for example, this would include harmony, timing, and pitch. The primary auditory cortex lies in the superior temporal gyrus of the temporal lobe and extends into the lateral sulcus and the transverse temporal gyri (also called Heschl's gyri). Final sound processing is then performed by the parietal and frontal lobes of the human cerebral cortex. Animal studies indicate that auditory fields of the cerebral cortex receive ascending input from the auditory thalamus and that they are interconnected on the same and on the opposite cerebral hemispheres. The auditory cortex is composed of fields that differ from each other in both structure and function. The number of fields varies in different species, from as few as 2 in rodents to as many as 15 in the rhesus monkey. The number, location, and organization of fields in the human auditory cortex are not known at this time. What is known about the human auditory cortex comes from a base of knowledge gained from studies in mammals, including primates, used to interpret electrophysiological tests and functional imaging studies of the brain in humans. When each instrument of a symphony orchestra or jazz band plays the same note, the quality of each sound is different, but the musician perceives each note as having the same pitch. The neurons of the auditory cortex of the brain are able to respond to pitch. Studies in the marmoset monkey have shown that pitch-selective neurons are located in a cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex. This location of a pitch-selective area has also been identified in recent functional imaging studies in humans. The primary auditory cortex is subject to modulation by numerous neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, which has been shown to decrease cellular excitability in all layers of the temporal cortex. alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activation, by norepinephrine, decreases glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials at AMPA receptors. = Relationship to the auditory system = Areas of localization on lateral surface of hemisphere. Motor area in red. Area of general sensations in blue. Auditory area in green. Visual area in yellow. The auditory cortex is the most highly organized processing unit of sound in the brain. This cortex area is the neural crux of hearing, and--in humans--language and music. The auditory cortex is divided into three separate parts: the primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortex. These structures are formed concentrically around one another, with the primary cortex in the middle and the tertiary cortex on the outside. The primary auditory cortex is tonotopically organized, which means that neighboring cells in the cortex respond to neighboring frequencies. Tonotopic mapping is preserved throughout most of the audition circuit. The primary auditory cortex receives direct input from the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and thus is thought to identify the fundamental elements of music, such as pitch and loudness. An evoked response study of congenitally deaf kittens used local field potentials to measure cortical plasticity in the auditory cortex. These kittens were stimulated and measured against a control (an un-stimulated congenitally deaf cat (CDC)) and normal hearing cats. The field potentials measured for artificially stimulated CDC were eventually much stronger than that of a normal hearing cat. This finding accords with a study by Eckart Altenmuller, in which it was observed that students who received musical instruction had greater cortical activation than those who did not. The auditory cortex has distinct responses to sounds in the gamma band. When subjects are exposed to three or four cycles of a 40 hertz click, an abnormal spike appears in the EEG data, which is not present for other stimuli. The spike in neuronal activity correlating to this frequency is not restrained to the tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex. It has been theorized that gamma frequencies are resonant frequencies of certain areas of the brain and appear to affect the visual cortex as well. Gamma band activation (25 to 100 Hz) has been shown to be present during the perception of sensory events and the process of recognition. In a 2000 study by Kneif and colleagues, subjects were presented with eight musical notes to well-known tunes, such as Yankee Doodle and Fr√®re Jacques. Randomly, the sixth and seventh notes were omitted and an electroencephalogram, as well as a magnetoencephalogram were each employed to measure the neural results. Specifically, the presence of gamma waves, induced by the auditory task at hand, were measured from the temples of the subjects. The omitted stimulus response (OSR) was located in a slightly different position; 7 mm more anterior, 13 mm more medial and 13 mm more superior in respect to the complete sets. The OSR recordings were also characteristically lower in gamma waves as compared to the complete musical set. The evoked responses during the sixth and seventh omitted notes are assumed to be imagined, and were characteristically different, especially in the right hemisphere. The right auditory cortex has long been shown to be more sensitive to tonality, while the left auditory cortex has been shown to be more sensitive to minute sequential differences in sound, such as in speech. Tonality is represented in more places than just the auditory cortex; one other specific area is the rostromedial prefrontal cortex (RMPFC). A study explored the areas of the brain which were active during tonality processing, using fMRI. The results of this experiment showed preferential blood-oxygen-level-dependent activation of specific voxels in RMPFC for specific tonal arrangements. Though these collections of voxels do not represent the same tonal arrangements between subjects or within subjects over multiple trials, it is interesting and informative that RMPFC, an area not usually associated with audition, seems to code for immediate tonal arrangements in this respect. RMPFC is a subsection of the medial prefrontal cortex, which projects to many diverse areas including the amygdala, and is thought to aid in the inhibition of negative emotion. Another study has suggested that people who experience 'chills' while listening to music have a higher volume of fibres connecting their auditory cortex to areas associated with emotional processing. In a study involving dichotic listening to speech, in which one message is presented to the right ear and another to the left, it was found that the participants chose letters with stops (e.g. 'p', 't', 'k', 'b') far more often when presented to the right ear than the left. However, when presented with phonemic sounds of longer duration, such as vowels, the participants did not favor any particular ear. Due to the contralateral nature of the auditory system, the right ear is connected to Wernicke's area, located within the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the left cerebral hemisphere. Sounds entering the auditory cortex are treated differently depending on whether or not they register as speech. When people listen to speech, according to the strong and weak speech mode hypotheses, they, respectively, engage perceptual mechanisms unique to speech or engage their knowledge of language as a whole.

A rubber is completed when one pair becomes first to win two games, each game presenting a score of 100 or more contract points; a new game ensues until one pair has won two games to conclude the rubber. Owing to the availability of various additional bonus and penalty points in the scoring, it is possible, though less common, to win the rubber by amassing more total points despite losing two games out of three. Rubber bridge involves a high degree of skill but there is also a fair amount of luck involved in who gets the best cards. Playing rubber bridge Rubber bridge is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. From high to low, the cards are ranked A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2. Suits are ranked Spades (), Hearts (), Diamonds (), Clubs (). Four players play in two partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other. Gameplay rotates clockwise around the table. =Choosing partners and dealing= At the beginning of the rubber, cards are drawn to determine partnerships and the dealer of the first hand. A pack of cards is spread face down on the table and each player takes a card, but not from the ends. The player with the highest card deals the first hand and has choice of seat. The player with the second highest card partners with the dealer against the other two. The dealer selects a pack of cards and passes it to the player on their left to be shuffled. Dealer, who may give the cards a quick shuffle at this point, then passes it to be cut by the player on their right. They then deal one card at a time clockwise starting with the player on their left. Meanwhile, if a second pack is being used, dealer's partner shuffles it and places it on their right, ready for the next dealer. This speeds up play and maintains the dealing order because there is always a shuffled pack of card on the dealer's left and each side deals the same pack throughout the rubber. The deal rotates clockwise after each hand until the rubber is completed. =Auction= The contract to be played is determined by an auction in which the players bid for the number of tricks they will make and the trump suit or no trumps. A bid consists of the number of tricks above six one needs to make and the denomination; e.g. \\"1\\" is seven tricks with clubs as trumps, \\"3NT\\" is nine tricks with no trump suit. The dealer bids first. At their turn players may either: pass, bid to make a higher contract, \\"double\\" an opponent's contract (which increases the penalties for failing to make the contract or the points for making the contract) or \\"redouble\\" their side's doubled contract which doubles the points again. A player may bid again after an initial pass. The auction ends when any bid is followed by three consecutive passes. If all four players pass the hand is passed in and the deal rotates. =Play= Once the contract has been decided, the player of the winning pair who first mentioned the denomination of the contract becomes declarer. The opening lead is made by the player to the declarer's left. Declarer‚Äôs partner then lays down their hand face up on the table as dummy, with the trump suit on their right. Declarer plays both his and dummy's cards. Each player, in turn, plays a card to the trick and they must play a card of the suit led if they have one. A player who has no cards of the suit led may play any card either discarding or trumping. A trick is won by the highest card of the suit led unless trumps are played, when the highest trump wins. The winner of the trick leads to the next trick. Scoring The main article includes a detailed description of rubber bridge scoring with examples. Essentially, each winning bid's value is scored \\"below the line\\" (e.g., 3 Spades nets 90 points below the line) and overtricks, bonuses, etc. are scored \\"above the line\\", as are points for defeating contracts. Once a pair reaches 100 points \\"below the line\\", the game ends and a new one begins, with a new line drawn underneath all previous points. The first team to win two games wins what is called the \\"rubber\\" and receives a large point bonus. Whoever has the highest point total after this bonus is assigned wins the match overall. Tactics At rubber the goal is to win the most points over a series of hands and it is important to make contracts to try to win the rubber and get the bonus. Overtricks do not matter - even less than at IMPs. Balancing over low-level contracts is not as attractive, because unless one can make contract one has little to gain and may force the opponents into a higher-scoring contract. Sacrificing can be expensive and only preserves the current state rubber as far as points below the line go and a 500-point penalty is possibly worth as much as winning the rubber. At rubber every hand is affected by the context of the score and there are many different factors to consider and weigh. One needs to be constantly aware of not just the vulnerability but what legs (part-games) both sides have as affects the meanings of bids. Game may only require 2 so it is worth stretching to bid it with a weak hand but not to go higher with a strong hand unless 6 is a reasonable chance. Part-scores like 40 and 60 are highly worthwhile as one can make game with two of major or 1NT respectively on a later hand. This is very different from duplicate bridge where each part-score and game are worth fixed amounts and each hand is an individual battle over points. Laws of rubber bridge There are no universally accepted rules for rubber bridge, but some zonal organisations have published their own.

History Rubber bridge is the traditional form of contract bridge and remains the most common variant for informal home-based social games and high stake games at clubs. It gained a lot of publicity after a celebrated match, referred to as the \\"Bridge Battle of the Century\\", was held December 1931 to January 1932 between teams led by Ely Culbertson and Sidney Lenz. A total of 150 rubbers were played, and was ultimately won by the Culbertson team by a margin of 8,980 points. The match was a total success both for the game itself and the concepts of bidding as promoted by Culbertson.

The Split Oceanographic Institute, situated on Marjan. Church of St. Nicholas on Marjan hill Cross on Marjan hill Marjan () is a hill on the peninsula of the city of Split, the second largest city of Croatia. It is covered in a dense Mediterranean pine forest and completely surrounded by the city and the sea, making it a unique sight. Originally used as a park by the citizens as early as the 3rd century, it is a favorite weekend excursion destination and a recreational center for the city. It is also the setting for numerous beaches and jogging trails as well as tennis courts and the city Zoo, all surrounded by the scenic forest. The tip of the peninsula houses the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries (Institut za oceanografiju i ribarstvo, IZOR). Marjan is 178 m tall and offers a view of the entire city, the surrounding islands, and the nearby mountains of Mosor and Kozjak. Beaches Ka≈°juni and Bene are located at the foot of Marjan hill.  History  In ancient times Emperor Diocletian built his palace a few minutes walk from Marjan. This opulent palace-city was actually inhabited by up to 8,000 to 10,000 people,C. Michael Hogan, \\"Diocletian's Palace\\", The Megalithic Portal, A. Burnham Ed, October 6, 2007 who required parks and recreation space, Diocletian therefore organized some areas of Marjan nearer to the palace as a park.Frederick Hamilton Jackson, (1908) The Shores of the Adriatic, J. Murray, 420 pages There is also a small rustic early 13th century AD church situated on Marjan Hill.NebojsÃÜa TomasÃÜeviƒá, Madge TomasÃÜeviƒá, Karin Radovanoviƒá, Treasures of Yugoslavia: An Encyclopedic Touring Guide, 1983, 612 pages The church is dedicated to St. Nicholas (Sv. Nikole) a favourite saint of fishermen, of which there are many in Split. Two and a half kilometres further along the path that runs along the south rim of Marjan is the fifteenth century church of St. Jerome (Sv. Jeronima). The church has an altar carved by Andrija Ale≈°i. Built into clefts in the cliffs directly above and behind St. Jerome are a group of Renaissance hermitage caves, first used in the 15th century. On the eastern slopes of the Marjan, just above the city, is Split's old Jewish cemetery. First established in 1573, the cemetery has over 700 graves, with readable tombstones from the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, the last burial taking place in 1945 when it was closed and protected as a monument. Marjan has become a symbol of Split in the last century and a half, before that it was considered an ordinary part of the landscape. As the city grew, however, it was left out because of its rocky and difficult terrain, and became, in effect, a part of the wilderness next to the very center of the city. Soon the citizens started to frequent it as a picnic spot and a romantic retreat, its many beaches adding to its popularity as well. During the Second World War, Marjan was the subject of a popular Partisan song \\"Marjane, Marjane\\", sung by the Split (and Dalmatian) members of that anti-fascist movement and was reportedly a favorite song of resistance leader and future president of the new SFR Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito. Indeed, the flamboyant Partisan leader was so fond of the hill itself, he chose it as the site for the summer residence of the Yugoslav president, the Vila Dalmacija. In the 1950s, during the period of the second Yugoslavia, the Federal Government, in conjunction with local Split authorities, undertook a massive project for the transformation of the entire wild hill into a forest park. The hill was intensively forested (large parts of it were barren until then), many recreational facilities were built, including jogging tracks, a road system encircling the peninsula, a maritime research institute, the Split City Zoo (now fallen into disrepair), botanical garden (recently abandoned) and a water pipeline reaching all the way to the top of the hill. The authorities also constructed the city weather station and two \\"vidilice\\", or \\"look-out points\\", as resting places connected with a long stairway all the way to the Diocletian's Palace, the \\"Riva\\" promenade and the rest of the city center. On the south side of the Marjan is the Me≈°troviƒá Gallery housed in the former villa of Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, thought by many to be one of the greatest sculptors of religious subjects since the Renaissance.

Transverse temporal gyri are superior to and separated from the planum temporale (cortex involved in language production) by Heschl‚Äôs sulcus. Transverse temporal gyri are found in varying numbers in both the right and left hemispheres of the brain and one study found that this number is not related to the hemisphere or dominance of hemisphere studied in subjects. Transverse temporal gyri can be viewed in the sagittal plane as either an omega shape (if one gyrus is present) or a heart shape (if two gyri and a sulcus are present). Transverse temporal gyri are the first cortical structures to process incoming auditory information. Anatomically, the transverse temporal gyri are distinct in that they run mediolaterally (toward the center of the brain), rather than front to back as all other temporal lobe gyri run. The transverse temporal gyri are active during auditory processing under fMRI for tone and semantic tasks. Transverse temporal gyri were found in one study to have significantly faster processing rates (33 Hz) in the left hemisphere compared to those in the right hemisphere (3 Hz). Additionally this difference in processing rate was found to be related to the volume of rate- related cortex in the gyri; right transverse temporal gyri were found to be more active during temporal processing, and these gyri were found to have more ‚Äúrate-related cortex‚Äù. White and grey matter volumes of transverse temporal gyri were not found to relate to this processing speed, although larger white matter volumes in subjects are associated with increased sensitivity to ‚Äúrapid auditory input‚Äù. The role of transverse temporal gyri in auditory processing of tone is demonstrated by a study by Wong, Warrier et. al. (2008). This study revealed the following: subjects who could successfully form an association between Mandarin Chinese ‚Äúpitch patterns‚Äù and word meaning were found to have transverse temporal gyri with larger volume than subjects who had ‚Äúdifficulty learning these associations.‚Äù Successful completion of the previous task also was found to be associated with a ‚Äúgreater concentration of white matter‚Äù in the left transverse temporal gyri of the subject. In general, larger transverse temporal gyri ‚Äúcould be associated with more efficient processing of speech-related cues which could facilitate learning and perceiving new speech sounds.‚Äù The Heschl's gyri are named after Richard L.

Zimbabwe's game reserves are managed by the government. They were initially founded as a means of using unproductive land.  History  The first proclaimed game reserve was Wankie (now Hwange), formed in 1928 and upgraded in the 1949 National Parks Act. The then-Rhodesia's game section was originally formed in 1952 as a subsidiary of the Department of Mines, Lands and Surveys. This was the nucleus that became the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management in 1964. The Parks and Wildlife Act of 1975 established the agency.http://zimparks.org/about- zimparks/ It was a quintessential breakthrough for conservation. The core philosophy of how people perceived wildlife was changed. Under the act, ownership of wildlife passed from the state to whoever owned the land the animal lived on. When the landowners (both communal and private) became custodians of the wildlife, a change in mindset occurred. People began to see their wildlife resources as an asset to be nurtured, ensuring their benefits continued into the future. Gradually, fence-breaking elephant and zebra were not viewed as nuisances to be eradicated; herds of impala were no longer a quick, easy meal. Within the Parks and Wildlife Act, various levels were defined at which state-owned land was to be protected and utilised. Gone was the old Game Department that issued hunting licences which, for a nominal fee, allowed settlers to hunt wildlife in all areas but a few game reserves. A system of national parks, botanical reserves and gardens, sanctuaries, recreational parks and safari areas was set firmly in place. Since 1975, the act has been amended and refined, allowing the evolution of a dynamic wildlife-protection process. Many African countries have since adopted this philosophy. So far-reaching was the concept of the original act that it now enshrines many aspects of grassroots conservation being implemented worldwide. Communal or traditional tribal areas and privately owned land were also categorised for different levels of utilisation. Communal areas harbouring significant wildlife resources or bordering national parks were given Appropriate Authority status through their Rural Councils, and as a result the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources was born. CAMPFIRE has developed into an important conservation strategy, ensuring that significant financial earnings revert to rural communities for their benefit. This philosophy has been adopted on a pan-African basis and is slowly being implemented in Asia and South America as well. Many of Zimbabwe's national parks, such as Victoria Falls, Mana Pools and Hwange, are renowned worldwide, though the country also has lesser-known gems such as Chizarira and Gonarezhou. Parts of the Rhodes Estate, established in Rhodes' will of 1902, were bequeathed to the nation for farming, forestry and agricultural research. This land later became part of the rocky Matobo and mountainous Nyanga National Parks.

He is best known for his time as Low Ki and Senshi with Impact Wrestling, Ring of Honor and WWE as Kaval.He is overall a nineteen-time world champion in major professional wrestling promotions. He is a one-time PWG World Champion, the inaugural ROH World Champion, one-time MLW World Heavyweight Champion and a three-time NWA World Tag Team Champion, and has won a number of tournaments and other championships on the independent circuit, and was the winner of the second season of NXT in 2010. Silvestry has also worked extensively in Japan, most notably for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he was a three-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion, and Pro Wrestling Zero-One (Zero-One), where he was a one-time Zero-One International Junior Heavyweight and NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Champion.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career and training (1998‚Äì2002) = Silvestry began wrestling in late 1998 under the ring name Low Ki, which he derived from the lyrics of the song \\"No Diggity\\". He began wrestling for Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) in 1998, challenging Homicide and Kane D for the JAPW Tag Team Championship. The following year he challenged for the JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship twice, unsuccessfully, but defeated Crazy Ivan and Judas Young to win the second Best of the Light Heavyweights tournament. In 2000, he began making several appearances in the World Wrestling Federation on their programs Metal and Jakked, where he competed against the likes of Raven, Crash Holly, Christian and Essa R√≠os. The following year he made it through to the finals of All Pro Wrestling's King of the Indies tournament, losing the crown to American Dragon. It was also during 2001 that he defeated Nick Berk and Homicide in separate matches on the same evening to win both the JAPW Heavyweight and Light Heavyweight Titles; he would successfully defend both titles in separate matches at their Fourth Anniversary Show later that month in July. He lost both titles in a Three Way match the following month to Homicide, with Xavier as the other competitor. = Ring of Honor (2002‚Äì2006) = Low Ki in the ring in 2008. Low Ki made his Ring of Honor (ROH) debut at its first show, The Era of Honor Begins, on February 23. In the show's main event, he defeated Bryan Danielson and \\"The Fallen Angel\\" Christopher Daniels. On July 27, 2002, at Crowning a Champion, he became the first ever ROH Champion by defeating Daniels, Spanky and Doug Williams in a Four Way Ironman match. On August 24, Low Ki successfully defended his title against A.J. Styles. On September 21, at Unscripted, he lost the title to Xavier, who, after winning the title, became a member of Daniels's faction The Prophecy. Low Ki then faced Samoa Joe on October 5 in what was Joe's official ROH debut in a \\"Fight Without Honor\\". In what resembled more of an MMA fight, Low Ki won the match and they shook hands after the match. Low Ki left the promotion in 2004 due to the Feinstein incident, but he returned on July 17, 2004, during a match, where Samoa Joe and the Briscoe Brothers fought against The Rottweilers (Homicide and the Havana Pitbulls). It looked like Low Ki would save Samoa Joe from a beatdown by The Rottweilers, but instead he spat on the ROH Championship, which was then held by Joe, and joined The Rottweilers. At Weekend of Thunder Night 2 on November 6, 2004, he started a feud with Bryan Danielson, who was Low Ki's partner in a match against Samoa Joe and Jushin Thunder Liger. Low Ki and Danielson lost the match and Low Ki blamed his partner for that, so The Rottweilers started a beatdown on Danielson. On December 4, at All Star Extravaganza II, Danielson defeated Homicide of The Rottweilers. In that same event, Low Ki wrestled Austin Aries in a number one contender's match to determine who would face ROH Champion Samoa Joe for the title. The match ended in a draw. Officials extended the match, but Low Ki refused to wrestle, so Aries was declared the winner. Instead of facing Joe at Final Battle 2004, Low Ki wrestled Danielson, but got himself disqualified and then attacked the referee. This was enough for ROH officials to suspend him indefinitely as a result. Low Ki returned on May 7, 2005 and immediately attacked Jay Lethal and Samoa Joe at Manhattan Mayhem with his fellow Rottweilers, Homicide, Julius Smokes, Monsta Mack and Rocky Romero. The impromptu tag team match was made: The Rottweilers vs. Samoa Joe and Jay Lethal. Low Ki and Homicide won the match and injured Lethal with a Ghetto Stomp/Cop Killa combination. The feud continued on June 18 at Death Before Dishonor III, where he and Lethal faced each other in a singles match, but it ended in a no contest. They had a rematch on August 12 at Redemption, but the ending was the same and Rottweilers beat Lethal down after the match. Finally, on September 17 at Glory By Honor IV, a \\"Fight Without Honor\\" between the two ended with Low Ki getting a pinfall victory over Lethal. After Samoa Joe went on to save Colt Cabana from a beatdown by The Rottweilers, Lethal came out to even the odds and said that he wanted yet another rematch with Low Ki, which Lethal won this time, ending the feud. Later in the year, Low Ki helped Homicide in his feud against Colt Cabana. On December 17, 2005, at Final Battle 2005, he challenged Kenta for his GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship, but came up short. Low Ki left ROH once again in January 2006 due to a \\"disagreement in business arrangements\\". He won his last match on January 28 against Jack Evans. ROH covered his leaving by having the ROH commissioner Jim Cornette ban Low Ki from Ring of Honor for life after it was discovered that he was the one who knocked Cornette's tooth out at that show. He was also used as a focus point (in name only) in the Cornette/Homicide feud in the summer of 2006, with Cornette refusing to reinstate Low Ki as Homicide's \\"third wish.\\" = Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002‚Äì2004) = Low Ki's first stint with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) was for its debut show on June 19, 2002, in a six-man tag team match alongside A.J. Styles and Jerry Lynn against the Flying Elvises. On June 26, he attempted to become the first X Division Champion, but was beaten by Styles. He would, though, eventually go on to win the title from Styles on August 7, but lost it three weeks later to Lynn. He would later form the Triple X faction with Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper that year and hold the NWA World Tag Team Championship three times under the \\"Freebird Rule\\". Low Ki wrestled beside Skipper when Triple X defeated America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) for the title on January 22, 2003. When Daniels's greed for the X Division Championship initially forced Low Ki out of Triple X, Low Ki would go on to battle Daniels in Ultimate X, but his pursuit was unsuccessful. He left TNA in July 2004 and made his return to ROH. = Japan (2002‚Äì2009) = Low Ki wrestling Kenta Kobashi. Low Ki made his first trip to Japan with Pro Wrestling Zero-One in 2002. On September 16, he defeated Leonardo Spanky for the International Junior Heavyweight Championship from him. He held the championship until August 31, 2003, when he lost it to Wataru Sakata. During 2003, Low Ki also made several appearances for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). Low Ki left Zero- One in mid-2004 to join Pro Wrestling Noah, where he was instantly given a title shot against Global Honored Crown (GHC) Junior Heavyweight Champion Yoshinobu Kanemaru, which he was unable to win. During this period, he represented Noah in MXW Pro Wrestling's Gaijin Battle Series. He later joined New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) and joined Shinsuke Nakamura's stable RISE, replacing the injured Milano Collection A.T.; in his first match back, he suffered a knee injury, which required surgery. Low Ki returned to the promotion in September, defecting from RISE to join New Japan's main villainous faction, Great Bash Heel (GBH). After joining GBH, he captured the International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP) Junior Heavyweight Championship from Tiger Mask on September 21, 2008 on NJPW's Circuit 2008 New Japan Generation tour. He subsequently lost it back to Tiger Mask on NJPW's Wrestle Kingdom III show in Tokyo on January 4, 2009. After losing the championship, Low Ki made several appearances for Hustle. = Return to TNA (2006‚Äì2008) = At Lockdown, Christopher Daniels's mystery opponent was revealed to be the returning Low Ki, who wrestled under the name of Senshi (Japanese for \\"warrior\\" or \\"soldier\\"). Following Lockdown, Senshi was not seen in action for several weeks. Instead, he was built up with a series of vignettes hyping his background, training, and desire to dominate the X Division once more, hinting at the possibility of challenging the X Division Champion, the undefeated Samoa Joe. Senshi defeated Alex Shelley, Jay Lethal, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt at Slammiversary to become the number one contender to the X Division Championship. Senshi went on to become X Division Champion again on the June 22, 2006 episode of Impact!, defeating Joe and Dutt after he pinned Dutt. He remained undefeated for six months, successfully defending the X Division Championship against Kazarian at Victory Road, Jay Lethal and Petey Williams in a three-way match at Hard Justice, and Chris Sabin at No Surrender, before losing the title to Sabin in October at Bound for Glory. Senshi later feuded with Austin Starr. Their feud would continue until Lockdown in a Six Sides of Steel match, which he won. At Slammiversary, he teamed with Rhino to defeat The Latin American Xchange (LAX). At Victory Road, Senshi competed in a 10-Man Ultimate X Match, which he lost. After the match, however, Triple X was reformed with Daniels, Senshi, and the returning Skipper. They won their reunion match on the July 19, 2007 episode of Impact! against Serotonin. Triple X faced Lethal and Dutt and The Motor City Machine Guns at Hard Justice in a losing effort. Skipper and Senshi also went on to face LAX at Bound for Glory in Ultimate X, ultimately losing. During December 2007, it was reported that Senshi had submitted his resignation to TNA and he left the promotion shortly after.

The formation took place at a unity conference in April 1975. The unity conference adopted a resolution on martyrs, programme, path, method of work, constitution and a statement on unification. The unity conference elected a Central Committee with Devulapalli Venkateswara Rao as its secretary. UCCRI(ML) had as its ambition to unite all communist revolutionary forces, including people within the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML)) fold. UCCRI(ML) started publishing the SPARK as its central organ.  Overview  Shortly after the formation of UCCRI(ML), the State of Emergency was proclaimed by the Indira Gandhi regime. UCCRI(ML) was proscribed and forced underground. There was a decision on behalf of the Kerala Communist Unity Centre to merge with UCCRI(ML) in June 1975, but that organization suffered internal splits and the merged was cancelled. In July 1976 T. Nagi Reddy, who had been the most important leader of the party, died. His death became a severe set-back for UCCRI(ML). In August the same year the organization suffered a split. A conflict had emerged in the CC, and D. V. Rao had been removed from the post of secretary. D. V. Rao accused three other CC members (led by a CC member from the NZC) of having formed a \\"rival centre\\", and suspended them unilaterally. In the split the Northern Zone Committee (i.e., Rajasthan) and Bengal Committee had broken away, along with the \\"rival centre\\". The break-away group later developed a pro-Albanian line. D. V. Rao returned to Andhra Pradesh and rallied the Andhra organization around him. D. V. Rao pushed through a merger of the Punjab Communist Revolutionary Committee with the UCCRI(ML) in June 1976. He resurrected a Central Committee including himself, the PCRC secretary Harbhajan Sohi and two leaders from Andhra (Madhu and Anand), which was to function until a regular conference would be held. UCCRI(ML) of D. V. Rao later evaluated the split in the following way: > From whatever the discussion that had taken place, we can draw some > conclusions. 1\\\\. Excepting on two issues, there reflected no divergencies in > the CC on political positions adopted by Com. D. V. Rao in the course of > whole development. 2\\\\. Com. D. V. Rao viewed the whole course of development > like this: The NZC and its allies did not accept the line with convictions > and genuinity. This was the basic cause for the split. They were > manipulators, careerists and doubtful elements. They were incorrigible. > Hence the split was unavoidable sooner or later.Unity Centre 1989, p. ? Branches were started in Orissa and Kerala. In 1978 a group from the Debra area of Midnapore, West Bengal joined UCCRI(ML) after some rounds of discussions with the CC. The convenor of the erstwhile Maharashtra State Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (which had left All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries after the expulsion of Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries) joined UCCRI(ML), leading to the formation of a unit in Maharashtra. UCCRI(ML) split for the second time in September 1979 when the Punjab committee, under the leadership of Harbhajan Sohi, broke away. HBS had developed a criticism of Mao Zedong's Three Worlds Theory. D. V. Rao, on the other hand, defended the Three Worlds Theory and the new leadership of the Communist Party of China. The Punjab committee came to establish a parallel UCCRI(ML). Ahead of the 1980 elections, UCCRI(ML) reviewed their stand towards participation. UCCRI(ML) always saw the issue of elections as a tactical issue. Initially the party had taken the policy of non-participation. But in 1980 UCCRI(ML) came out with an appeal to \\"defeat pro-super power reactionary forces in elections\\". An article written by D. V. Rao in the January 1980 issue of Proletarian Line (the central organ of UCCRI(ML) at the time) proposed the following: > We have been treating and are treating the participation or boycott... as a > form of struggle and our practice is the same. We do not think that > \\"boycott\\" can be the slogan of present day.... In the same way it is too > premature to think of candidates in the prevailing situation in which the > defective nature of electoral system is one. In these conditions our > participation will be one of taking measures to advance the revolutionary > movement by utilizing this opportunity. The people are being mobilised to > see the real face of contesting parties who have not been serving them in > any way what so ever. > Keeping all the points in view, we appeal to the people to defeat the game > of the two super powers in general and Soviet Union in particular. We appeal > to people to defeat the game of landlords who are trying to survive by > diverting the agrarian revolutionary movement. Almost all the election > parties are connected with these forces in one way or the other. The article continues; \\"Since pro-super power and reactionary forces in general and pro-Soviet forces in particular pose the main danger to our country we will mobilse all those forces who are opposed to them and see that they are strengthened so that they are able to defeat them as far as possible. In this connection, we ask the people to differentiate between genuine and fake anti-Soviet, democratic forces.\\" In the actual electoral campaign, however, the new policy was not consistent. In Andhra Pradesh the party promoted non-participation, in reality a boycott, whereas the party supported certain candidates in West Bengal and Orissa. In the aftermath of the elections, a split surged with D. V. Rao leaving the party with a group of followers in Andhra. D. V. Rao set up his own UCCRI(ML). After D. V. Rao's departure, Anand became the new CC Secretary of the remaining UCCRI(ML). In 1988 Anand broke away from UCCRI(ML) after a long period of dissent in the organization. The rift between Anand and other surged in the preparations to hold a party conference. Anand was able to win over the Maharashtra unit. Anand also reopened relations with Sohi's UCCRI(ML). After the split, the faction of Anand together with Sohis faction created the Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India together with three other groups the same year. The remaining UCCRI(ML) faction, led by Viswam and Madhu, merged into the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti in 1992. Madhu signed the merger agreement on behalf of UCCRI(ML).

History Once Austrian-born Adolf Hitler completed the union between his birth country and Germany (Anschluss), the Nazi government had the incorporated territory renamed. The name Austria (√ñsterreich in German, meaning \\"Eastern Realm\\") was at first replaced by \\"Ostmark\\", referring to the 10th century Marcha orientalis. The change was meant to refer to Austria as the new \\"eastern march\\" of the Reich. In August 1938, the Donau-Zeitung proudly referred to Passau as \\"the cradle of the new Ostmark\\".Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 165f Subdivision According to the Ostmarkgesetz with effect from 1 May 1939 the former States of Austria were reorganized into seven Reichsgaue, each under the rule of a government official holding the dual offices of Reichsstatthalter (governor) and Gauleiter (Nazi Party leader): legal text at verfassungen.de *Carinthia, including East Tyrol; increased by Slovenian Carinthia and Upper Carniola as occupied territories after the 1941 Balkans Campaign *\\"Lower Danube\\" (Niederdonau), name for Lower Austria, with its capital at Krems an der Donau, including the northern districts of Burgenland with Eisenstadt and the South Moravian territories around Znojmo (Deutsch- S√ºdm√§hren) annexed with the \\"Sudetenland\\" according to the 1938 Munich Agreement. *Salzburg *Styria, including the southern districts of Burgenland; increased by Lower Styria as occupied territory after the 1941 Balkans Campaign *\\"Upper Danube\\" (Oberdonau), name for Upper Austria, including the Styrian Aussee region (Ausseerland) and the South Bohemian territories around ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov annexed with the \\"Sudetenland\\" according to the 1938 Munich Agreement *Tyrol, i.e. North Tyrol, with the administrative district of Vorarlberg *Vienna, i.e. \\"Greater Vienna\\", including several surrounding Lower Austrian municipalities incorporated in 1938.

Omid (ŸÖ. ÿßŸÖ€åÿØ, Hope) was a prominent Iranian poet. He is one of the pioneers of Free Verse (New Style Poetry) in the Persian language. Biography Mehdi Akhavan Sales (M. Omid) was born on 1 March 1929, in Mashhad, Khorasan Province, Iran His father, Ali, originally from Fahraj in Yazd province, was an apothecary ( øa·π≠·π≠ƒÅr), and his mother, Maryam, a native of Khorasan. Akhavan Sales had to give up an interest in music to appease his father.He finished his elementary education in Mashhad and studied welding in the city's Technical School (honarestƒÅn) in 1941. It was in Mashhad that he was familiarized with the elementary principles of classical Persian prosody by one of his instructors in the technical school in Mashad, named Parviz KƒÅviƒÅn Jahromi, ,(Akhavan, 2003c, p. 386). Afterwards, Akhavan soon found his way to the literary circles of Mashad. One of the most notable of these circles was the Khorasan Literary Society. He chose M. Omid (Omid means hope) as his pen name and as he grew older, he began to play with the meaning of his poetic name with a sense of irony. Akhavan, along with a few others, formed BahƒÅr, a literary circle more in tune with modernist trends in poetry. Later he became involved in leftist politics and a member of the provincial committee of the recently established Youth Organization of the Tudeh Party. Following his education, Akhavan moved to Tehran (1949) and worked as a teacher. He married his cousin ·∏¥adijeh (IrƒÅn) in 1950 and they had six children: Laleh, Luli, Tus, Tanasgol, Zardo≈°t, and Mazdak  øAli. Akhavan‚Äôs first collection of poetry, Ar·∏°anun (The organ; Figure 3), was published in 1951 and when the government of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh was toppled by a coup, he took part in political activities and was imprisoned along with Nima Yooshij and other activists.Dastgheib, Abdolali. The Poet of Defeat, Critical Review of poems by Mehdi Akhavan-Sales. 2006. Amitis Publishers, Tehran, Iran. . (Farsi title ÿ¥ÿßÿπÿ± ÿ¥⁄©ÿ≥ÿ™ ). Akhavan‚Äôs second poetry collection named ZemestƒÅn (Winter) was published in 1956. After his release from prison in 1957, he started to work in radio, and soon after was transferred to Khouzestan to work in TV. Later on, he taught literature on radio and TV and at the university. After the 1979 Iranian Revolution he was granted membership to the Iranian Academy of Artists and Writers. In 1981 he was forced to retire from government service without pay. In 1990, following an invitation from the cultural organization in Germany, he traveled abroad for the first time. Few months after his return, he died in Tehran. He is buried on the grounds of the mausoleum of Ferdowsi in Tus. Poetry Tous, near Mashhad Although Akhavan Sales's poetic career began as early as 1942, he did not acquire a degree that recognized his achievements, which was necessary for breaking into literary circles, in his time; however, this changed when he published his third volume of poetry in 1956, entitled \\"Zemestan\\" (Winter); this volume boosted Sales's career and placed him among the top runners for the mantle of Nima Yushij. In fact, within many circles, Nader Naderpour and Akhavan Sales were equally recognized as worthy successors of the Bard of Mazandaran. The fact that, like Nima, both poets had begun as traditionalists and then worked their way into new realms of New Poetry (sic) through individual initiative itself, both deserved praise for singular effort (why single one out when two can hold the same title at once?). Akhavan's forte, like the bard of Tus, Ferdowsi, is epic; more precisely, he chooses themes of epical proportion and expresses them with the same zeal that Ferdowsi uses in the Shahnameh. The difference is that they wrote for diametrically opposed audiences. Akhavan Sales was free from involving his poetry in 'gavel by gavel' battles with Iranian and Turanian 'political' magistrates; on the contrary, he could focus on the themes and illustrating aspects of life with diverse, often far-fetched similes, metaphors, and symbols (without concerning himself, that is, with political consequences). Sales's language is complex. While translating his verse, one cannot ignore the impact of the internal rhythm, the interconnection of seemingly disparate images, and the ubiquitous presence of his thematic focus. Sales's \\"Winter,\\" for example, displays his understanding the depth of his philosophic convictions and, at the same time, the dexterity and finesse that distinguishes his writing. Iraj Bashiri's translation gives us the English equivalent: As Abdolali Dastgheib, literary critic writer puts it: Mehdi Akhavan-Sales benefitted from ancient treasures of Persian literature and was able to skillfully combine the old, traditional style with modern or even, everyday words to create some of the best works of Iranian poetry. His later works have a rich style and are a symbolic portrait of political and social atmosphere of the time. For example, his famous poem ‚ÄòWinter (ZemestƒÅn ÿ≤ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ, 1956)‚Äô which was written shortly following the coup against Iranian popular and liberal prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, and the suppression of freedom by the Shah‚Äôs government, shows his despair and loss of hope. In this poem, even close friends are not extending hands to each other or talking as ‚Äúthe cold is severely bitter‚Äù.Dastgheib, Abdolali.

(Farsi title ÿ¥ÿßÿπÿ± ÿ¥⁄©ÿ≥ÿ™ ) Mehdi Akhavan Sales is one of the best contemporary Persian poets.

He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand. Joe was previously known for his time with promotions Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and Ring of Honor (ROH). He established himself in ROH from the promotion's beginning in 2002, holding the ROH World Championship for a record 21 months from March 2003 to December 2004. Upon joining TNA in June 2005, he embarked on a 19-month-long undefeated streak, and went on to hold the TNA World Heavyweight Championship once, the TNA X Division Championship five times, the TNA World Tag Team Championship twice, and the TNA Television Championship once; completing the TNA Triple Crown and the TNA Grand Slam. He also wrestled internationally and on the independent circuit for various promotions, winning several titles, including the GHC Tag Team Championship with Magnus in Pro Wrestling Noah, and he was an inaugural NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Champion with Keiji Sakoda in Pro Wrestling Zero1. He left TNA in February 2015, briefly competing again in ROH and the independent circuit. Joe officially debuted in WWE's developmental territory NXT in May 2015, and signed a full-time contract with the company in June; he went on to become the first ever two-time NXT Champion, and the co-winner of the inaugural Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic (with Finn B√°lor). After joining the main roster in January 2017, he headlined several WWE pay-per-view events and contended for both the Universal and WWE Championships. In March 2019, Joe won his first title on the main roster, the United States Championship.  Early life  Seanoa was born and raised in Orange County, California. He resided mainly in Huntington Beach and spent time during his childhood in  ªEwa Beach, Hawaii. His family founded a Polynesian dance troupe in the United States called Tiare Productions. Seanoa made his stage debut at the 1984 Summer Olympics opening at the age of five. He became a California State Junior Judo Champion and was an all league football player while attending Ocean View High School. Before becoming a wrestler, Seanoa worked as a mortgage broker.  Professional wrestling career  Joe was the first graduate of the UIWA West Coast Dojo, training under Cincinnati Red, along with Johnny Hemp and, occasionally, John Delayo. He debuted in December 1999 in a match against \\"Uncle\\" Jess Hansen just three months after beginning training. = Ultimate Pro Wrestling (2000‚Äì2001) = Joe quickly signed with former WWF developmental affiliate Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), where he feuded with John Cena and made an appearance on WWF Jakked against Essa Rios.Hamilton, Ian. Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens To An Industry Without Competition. Lulu Press, 2006. (pg. 67) He tagged with Mike Knox at UPW Proving Ground on December 12, 2000 in the Galaxy Theatre of Santa Ana, California and defeated the debuting Al Katrazz with Basil. He eventually captured the UPW Heavyweight Championship. He later became the longest reigning UPW Heavyweight Champion ever. When Joe was in UPW, he met Bruce Prichard and Jim Ross, who told him that he would not have a future in pro wrestling. = Pro Wrestling Zero-One (2001‚Äì2002) = In June 2001, Joe made his way to Japan, wrestling for Shinya Hashimoto's Pro Wrestling Zero-One promotion, fighting in its Shingeki series of pay-per-views, as well as the annual Burning Heart tournaments. Joe continued to work for the promotion throughout 2002, participating in a number of their biggest shows and tournaments. After forming a team with Keiji Sakoda, they became the inaugural NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Champions, though their reign is no longer officially recognized by the promotion. He worked as both Samoa Joe and later King Joe, but ultimately chose to leave the promotion when he was asked to take on a more gimmicky character. = Ring of Honor (2002‚Äì2008) = Back in the United States, Joe joined the ranks of the East Coast-based Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion in 2002. He made his debut at \\"Glory by Honor\\" as Christopher Daniels's \\"hired assassin\\", brought in to take out Daniels's chief enemy, Low Ki. Originally booked for just the one match against Low Ki, Joe impressed fans with his extremely stiff and hard-hitting style that resembled a mixed martial arts fighter more than a wrestler, which led to ROH booking him full- time. Joe quickly rose through the ranks and became ROH Champion, defeating Xavier for the belt, which soon became the ROH World Championship on May 17, 2003 after defeating The Zebra Kid at \\"Frontiers of Honor\\" in London, England. He held that title for twenty one months before losing it to Austin Aries at \\"Final Battle 2004\\" on December 26, 2004. During this time, he had a trilogy of title defenses against CM Punk (the second match earning a 5 star rating from Dave Meltzer's Wrestling Observer Newsletter, the first American match in seven years to do so). Soon after losing the ROH World Championship to Austin Aries, Joe became the promotion's fifth Pure Champion, defeating his on-screen prot√©g√© Jay Lethal for the belt on May 7, 2005 at \\"Manhattan Mayhem\\" in New York City. He held the title for over three months before losing it to Nigel McGuinness on August 27 at \\"Dragon Gate Invasion\\". In October 2005, when Japanese heavyweight superstar Kenta Kobashi made a \\"once-in-a-lifetime\\" trip to the United States, he was signed to two Ring of Honor shows. ROH officials selected Joe to face him in a singles match on the first night and a tag match on the second. Joe proved to be a formidable opponent for Kobashi, in a back and forth match, which Dave Meltzer again gave a five-star rating. The match went on to win the Wrestling Observer Newsletter award for \\"Match of the Year\\". In 2006, Joe was one of the principal wrestlers representing Ring of Honor in their war against rival Philadelphia promotion Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW). The war culminated in a five-on-five Cage of Death match at \\"Death before Dishonor IV\\". Joe helped ROH dominate in the match, until, after picking up CZW wrestler Chris Hero for one of his finishers, the Muscle Buster, he was attacked by fellow ROH wrestler Bryan Danielson. Danielson repeatedly hit his injured knee with a steel chair, forcing him to quit the match. Joe was later replaced in the match by Homicide, who went on to win the match for ROH. Joe later teamed with Homicide to fight against the Briscoes, and, like Homicide, found himself back in the ROH world title hunt. Joe, however, came up short against champion Bryan Danielson in several matches, including a match that went to a 60 Minute Draw and the final one being a cage match on December 8. At the December 9 show, Joe called out the Pro Wrestling Noah promotion, claiming \\"Ring of Honor is right here!\\" This was not his first encounter with NOAH; at the September 16, 2006 ROH show, after a speech by wrestling legend Bruno Sammartino, Joe got into an argument and pull-apart brawl with Noah star Takeshi Morishima. Subsequently, a match was signed for February pitting Joe against Morishima which Joe won. Joe ceased to be a full- time performer in ROH on March 4, 2007. All shows that led up to that date were billed as the \\"Samoa Joe Farewell Tour\\". On March 4, he beat longtime rival Homicide in his final ROH match with a Muscle Buster from the second rope. On November 22, 2008, Joe made a one night only return for Rising Above, defeating Tyler Black in a non-pay-per-view main event. = Independent circuit (2003‚Äì2014) = From 2003 to 2007, Joe made several appearances for Southern California promotion Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), making his debut on November 15, 2003, when he defeated CM Punk in a singles match. During his time in the promotion, Joe had a notable on-screen rivalry with Super Dragon and unsuccessfully challenged Dragon for his PWG Championship on February 12, 2005. After Dragon had lost the title, Joe defeated him in a grudge match on August 19, 2005. Joe received another shot at the PWG Championship the following November, but was this time defeated by Kevin Steen. Joe made his to date final PWG appearance on April 8, 2007, when he defeated Low Ki in a singles match. From 2004 to 2006, Joe also made several appearances for Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (IWA-MS), where he most notably made it to the finals of the 2004 Ted Petty Invitational and, later that same year, won the Revolution Strong Style Tournament. On February 14, 2009, Joe made debuted for the Puerto Rican International Wrestling Association (IWA) at Noche de Campeones, where he unsuccessfully challenged El Chicano for the IWA Undisputed World Unified Heavyweight Championship. On November 3, 2013, Joe made his debut at Championship Wrestling From Hollywood, defeating Willie Mack. On November 3, Joe defeated Mack in the Main Event. On November 15, 2014, Joe appeared at JAPW 18th Anniversary Show, where he defeated Chris Hero. Throughout his career, Joe has also wrestled in Europe for promotions such German Stampede Wrestling (GSW), International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom (IPW:UK), and Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw). = Total Nonstop Action Wrestling =  Undefeated streak (2005‚Äì2006)  On June 14, 2005, Joe signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He made his official debut five days later at the Slammiversary pay-per-view, defeating Sonjay Dutt in a match that saw him dubbed \\"The Samoan Submission Machine\\" by announcer Mike Tenay. Joe was a participant in the Christopher Daniels Invitational Super X Cup, defeating Sonjay Dutt and Alex Shelley to advance to the tournament finals at Sacrifice. Joe won the tournament by defeating A.J. Styles, but only with help from Daniels. As a result of Daniels' interference, however, TNA Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko made Daniels defend his X Division Championship in a three-way match against both Joe and Styles at Unbreakable. This match marked Joe's first title shot in the company, though Styles won the match. Joe's undefeated streak was still officially intact, as it was Daniels that had been pinned, not Joe. This match is to date the only match in TNA's history to receive a rating of five stars from Dave Meltzer. Samoa Joe signing autographs for fans At Genesis on November 13, he teamed with Daniels, Alex Shelley, and Roderick Strong (a team that Daniels called \\"The Ministry\\") against Sonjay Dutt, Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, and Austin Aries in an eight man elimination match. Following the victory by Daniels and Joe (Shelley and Strong were eliminated earlier in the match), Joe attacked Daniels, beating him around the ringside area until he had busted him open. He then threw Daniels into the ring, and delivered a Muscle Buster. Joe then went out to grab a steel chair from ringside and brought it into the ring, after which he gave Daniels a second Muscle Buster, this time onto the chair, supposedly giving Daniels a level-3 concussion. In response to these actions, Styles called Joe out on an episode of Impact!, saying his attack of Daniels violated an unwritten code of respect in the X Division. Prior to Turning Point, Joe attacked Styles, saying he did not respect the X Division code (a vast departure from his Ring of Honor persona, who is a stalwart defender of their written Code of Honor). Joe defeated Styles at Turning Point and won the X Division Championship. Joe could not injure Styles, however, Daniels came out and stopped him. Daniels was later slated to face Joe at Final Resolution in 2006 for the X Division Championship. During the build-up to the match, Joe stated that he intended to end Daniels' career. During the match, Styles came down to the ring to cheer for Daniels. Not long after making Daniels bleed from his head, Joe stopped going for the pin, instead dropping knee after knee on Daniels' head. Styles, concerned about Daniels' health, signaled for the match to be stopped by throwing in the towel, allowing Joe to retain the X Division title. Joe proceeded to win the rematch of the three-way at Unbreakable, thus retaining his title. This three-way feud continued until Destination X, when he lost the title to Daniels in an Ultimate X match, a match in which there is no pinfall or submission, thus keeping his undefeated streak. Joe was then taken out of the X Division and was scheduled to take on Sabu at Lockdown. Despite that, he still had a scheduled X Division title match, and, on April 13's Impact! (TNA's Thursday debut), Joe regained the X Division title after delivering an Island Driver from the middle turnbuckle to Christopher Daniels. Joe then successfully defended his X Division title against Sabu at Lockdown. At Sacrifice, Joe partnered with Sting in a tag team match against Jeff Jarrett and Scott Steiner. Joe and Sting were victorious, but after the match, Joe left the ring and allowed Sting to be attacked. Joe explained this by stating that he agreed to only watch Sting's back \\"from bell to bell\\" (implying that once the second bell rang, his duties were over), but still had issues with Steiner. Joe added Scott Steiner to his undefeated streak, at Slammiversary. During the Impact! tapings on May 15, Joe was injured as he performed a kick, and it was reported that he tore every knee ligament except the anterior cruciate ligament. He suffered a first degree tear to the posterior cruciate ligament and a second degree tear to the medial collateral ligament. Joe would remain out of action for two weeks. After returning, Joe lost his X Division Championship in a triple threat match with Sonjay Dutt and Senshi. Senshi pinned Dutt to win the championship after Steiner laid out Joe with a steel chair. Joe would have his chance at revenge when he participated in a four-way number one contender match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship along with Sting, Christian Cage, and Scott Steiner at Victory Road on July 16. Joe lost this match when Sting pinned Steiner. Joe beat Jeff Jarrett at No Surrender in a \\"Fan's Revenge Lumberjack match\\". After the match, he took Jarrett's NWA World Heavyweight Championship with him, telling Jim Cornette that if Jarrett or Sting (Jarrett's scheduled opponent at Bound for Glory) wanted the belt, they could take it from him. On the October 12 episode, Joe agreed to return the belt to the Jarrett-Sting winner under one condition‚Äîthe winner had to agree to give him a title shot. This offer was turned down, and finally Joe was given the choice of giving back the title or be fired. Kurt Angle made his debut and got into a brawl with Joe after he again refused to give back the belt, and during the brawl, Jarrett took the belt back. At Bound for Glory on October 22, Joe defeated Raven, Brother Runt and Abyss in a Monster's Ball match. The match ended when special referee Jake Roberts performed a DDT to Raven, allowing Joe to deliver the Muscle Buster to Raven for the pinfall. Later in the night, Joe was involved in a pull-apart brawl with Kurt Angle after Jim Cornette announced that he would be fired if he interfered in the main event match that involved Angle as special enforcer. At Genesis, Joe lost to Angle after submitting to Angle's ankle lock. This ended his eighteen-month undefeated streak.  TNA World Heavyweight Champion (2006‚Äì2008)  Throughout the rest of 2006 into 2007, Joe continued to feud with Angle and picked up a victory by submission in their rematch at Turning Point, before suffering a legit knee injury in a tag team match. On January 14, 2007 at Final Resolution, Joe was defeated by Angle in a thirty-minute Iron Man match when Angle was put in the ankle lock but was saved from submitting another fall by the time expiring. On the February 14 edition of Impact!, Joe won a gauntlet match to become the number one contender to Christian Cage's NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Destination X, but lost the match. He qualified to compete in the Match of Champions at Victory Road by defeating Jay Lethal and Chris Sabin for the X Division title on the July 12 episode of Impact!. At the Match of Champions, Joe scored the winning pinfall on Brother Ray and won the TNA World Tag Team Championship from Team 3D, making him the first wrestler in TNA to hold multiple TNA championships. He opted to hold the title by himself. At Hard Justice, Joe put up the X Division title and both Tag Team titles against Kurt Angle's TNA World title as well as the IGF's version of the IWGP World Championship. Joe, however, lost all his titles thanks to interference by Karen Angle. Joe then became the teammate of Kevin Nash and Scott Hall in their match against the Angle Alliance at Turning Point. Hall, however, no- showed the event. Before the match, Joe was asked to cut a promo alleviating heat from the company and introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe went five minutes overtime and ranted against Hall, Nash and some other superstars, which legitimately upset Nash and TNA President Dixie Carter at ringside. Joe, Nash and Young defeated the Angle Alliance when Joe pinned Tomko. After the match, Joe and Nash briefly argued and shoved one another backstage, with Joe apologizing at a talent meeting the following day. On- screen, though, Joe continued to direct his frustration towards TNA management, going as far as to trash a Christmas party organized by Matt Morgan. In storyline, after complaining to Jim Cornette that he did not have a match at Final Resolution, Cornette decided to team Joe with Kevin Nash, who was to receive a title shot with Scott Hall when he returned. At Final Resolution, Joe and Nash lost to the team of A.J. Styles and Tomko after Nash refused to tag himself into the match leaving Joe to fend for himself. Joe at Bound for Glory IV At Against All Odds, Joe served as the special enforcer for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match where Kurt Angle defended his title against challenger Christian Cage. During the contest, A.J. Styles interfered and Joe fought Styles to the back, but Tomko came out and attacked Cage giving Angle the win. On the February 14 edition of Impact!, Joe formed an alliance with Cage and Kevin Nash, to compete with Kurt Angle's Angle Alliance. Joe was also given the next TNA World Heavyweight Championship opportunity against Angle. At Lockdown, Joe defeated Angle to win his first TNA World Championship and become TNA's third Triple Crown Champion.

At Hard Justice, Joe defeated Booker after a guitar shot, thus reclaiming physical possession of the title belt, which Booker had kept after Victory Road. At Bound for Glory IV, he fought Sting in a losing effort to defend the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, ending his reign at 182 days. On the October 30 edition of Impact!, Joe and AJ Styles formed a faction of younger wrestlers also featuring Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Petey Williams, Eric Young, ODB and The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin), calling themselves \\"The Frontline\\", to oppose The Main Event Mafia of Kurt Angle, Sting, Kevin Nash, Booker T and Scott Steiner. At Turning Point Nash defeated Joe by pinning him with his feet on the ropes following a steel chair shot, a low blow and after ramming Joe's head to an exposed turnbuckle. At Final Resolution, The Front Line lost to The Main Event Mafia in a 4-on-4 tag match and Styles failed to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the December 18 edition of Impact!, Joe and Styles defeated Sting and Nash in a Six Sides of Steel match. Following the match, Joe was attacked by the members of the Main Event Mafia and suffered injuries which would sideline him for the rest of the year.  The Main Event Mafia and Nation of Violence (2009‚Äì2011)  On the January 29 episode of Impact!, a short video was shown in which Joe, sporting a new buzzcut hairstyle, tribal facepaint, and much heavier frame stated he would like to introduce the Main Event Mafia to both the \\"real\\" Joe and his \\"nation of violence\\". At Destination X, Joe got himself disqualified in his return match against his old rival and Main Event Mafia member Scott Steiner. That same week on Impact!, Joe once again got disqualified this time in a match with Sheik Abdul Bashir. He took him backstage, hung him upside down, and tortured him. The following week, he competed in a 20-man Six Sides of Steel match, where the last two men standing would be determined the captains of the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown. He entered last and won the match by pinning rival Kurt Angle via the Muscle Buster. He then later stated backstage that he did not wish to be captain, but would still be part of the team. His teammates were Jeff Jarrett, A.J. Styles and the returning Daniels. They faced off against The Main Event Mafia at Lockdown, and won the match. At this time he also revealed that he was taking orders from a \\"secret advisor\\" who he was seen talking to many times backstage although the person's identity was not revealed. He then feuded with Kevin Nash as his next victim of the Mafia and finally beat his old mentor at Sacrifice. At Slammiversary, Joe betrayed A.J. Styles and turned on all the fans by helping Kurt Angle win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the King of the Mountain match, and thus turned heel. On the June 25 episode of Impact!, Joe officially joined The Main Event Mafia after having spent the last five months taking them out. This was revealed by Angle, to be a master plan to fool the TNA Frontline and the attacks were all planned by Joe and the Mafia in advance. Joe then went on to explain that he joined the Mafia for the money that was invested by Jenna Morasca and for the power and also debuted a new rap themed, entrance music. Throughout the night, he carried out attacks with the Mafia on Styles and Daniels and the leader of the Mafia, Sting, who was kicked out of the Mafia as leader and once again replaced with Kurt Angle. At Victory Road, Joe faced Sting in a grudge match. Late in the match, Taz made his TNA debut and helped Joe beat Sting, thus revealing himself as his new adviser. At Hard Justice Joe defeated Homicide to win the X Division title for the fourth time. After winning this title, Joe feuded with his longtime rival Daniels and defeated him at No Surrender. On the October 8 edition of Impact! Joe lost the X Division title to Amazing Red after Bobby Lashley interfered in the match. At Bound for Glory Lashley defeated Joe in a submission match with a referee stoppage. On the following edition of Impact! Kurt Angle turned into a fan favorite, thus signaling the end of the Main Event Mafia. The following month at Turning Point Joe unsuccessfully challenged TNA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles for the title in a three-way match, also involving Daniels. At Final Resolution Joe took part in the \\"Feast or Fired\\" match and won the briefcase containing a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. After being off TV for several weeks, Joe returned on the February 4 edition of Impact!, by attacking A.J. Styles, who had recently turned heel with Ric Flair, and declared that he would be using his \\"Feast or Fired\\" briefcase to get a shot at Styles' World Heavyweight Championship at Against All Odds, turning face in the process. At the pay-per-view Styles retained his title against Joe in a No Disqualification match refereed by Eric Bischoff. After losing a match against new TNA acquisition Orlando Jordan on the following Impact!, Joe was abducted by masked men. On March 29 he resurfaced in a video package on an episode of Impact!. Joe made his return on the April 19 edition of Impact! appearing as a surprise member of Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett and Rob Terry) in an eight-man tag team match against Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm), in which he scored the deciding pinfall by pinning Roode after a Muscle Buster. Joe then left the Impact Zone and did not celebrate with his fellow team members. His abduction never was explained. According to Joe, Vince Russo planned a big storyline with a psycho gimmick. However, Russo called him to return because he need more babyfaces and Russo never find the way to explain the abduction. The following week Joe inexplicably assaulted the X Division Champion Kazarian, after his title match with Shannon Moore. In the following weeks Joe went on to randomly attack wrestlers like Douglas Williams, Brian Kendrick and Matt Morgan, the last of whom lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship thanks to the attack. On the May 20 edition of Impact! Joe was ranked number ten in the first ever TNA Championship Committee rankings for a World Heavyweight Championship title shot. He began his climb up the rankings by defeating Hernandez on June 17, number four ranked A.J. Styles on July 1 and by wrestling number two ranked Jeff Hardy to a ten-minute time limit draw on the July 22 edition of Impact!. After the match with Hardy, Joe was upset with the production crew for starting a countdown to the time limit draw, when Joe specifically requested not to start one because he thought it would reveal the ending of the match early. Because of his outburst, Joe was suspended from TNA indefinitely. Joe returned from his suspension on August 23 at the tapings of the August 26 edition of Impact! to defeat Orlando Jordan. The following week on Impact!, Joe aligned himself with Jeff Jarrett and Hulk Hogan in their war with Sting and Kevin Nash. At No Surrender Joe and Jarrett defeated Sting and Nash in a tag team match, when Joe choked out Sting, after Jarrett had hit him with his baseball bat behind Joe's back. At Bound for Glory Joe and Jarrett faced Sting, Nash and their newest ally D'Angelo Dinero in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was scheduled to team with Joe and Jarrett, was forced to pull out due to a back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe and left him to be pinned by Nash. Later in the night it was revealed that Hogan was in fact in the building as he helped Jeff Hardy win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and formed a new heel alliance with Hardy, Eric Bischoff, Jeff Jarrett and Abyss. Samoa Joe in October 2010 Joe tried to attack Jarrett on the October 21 edition of Impact!, but was stopped by TNA's security officers Gunner and Murphy, before being beat down by Jarrett. Joe returned two weeks later, attacking Jarrett, Gunner and Murphy. At Turning Point Jarrett defeated Joe, after choking him out with a baton, following interference from Gunner and Murphy.

Joe returned on the January 6, 2011, edition of Impact!, confronting D'Angelo Dinero and claiming that he had not been using his donations to help the needy, like he was supposed to.

On February 13 at Against All Odds Joe defeated Dinero in a singles match, but was afterwards attacked and bloodied by him. On the March 10 edition of Impact!, Dinero defeated Joe in a rematch between the two, after hitting him with a chain. On April 17 at Lockdown, Joe defeated Dinero in a steel cage match to end the feud. Crimson at Slammiversary IX Joe's next feud would be with the undefeated Crimson, whom he would abandon in the ring and the hands of Abyss on two occasions, claiming that he himself had not needed anyone's help during his own undefeated streak, becoming a tweener in the process. On June 12 at Slammiversary IX, Joe was defeated by Crimson in a singles match, and afterwards shook Crimson's hand. Afterwards, Joe began showing frustration as his losing streak continued with losses against Rob Van Dam, Devon, Kazarian and Bobby Roode. After losing all nine of his matches in the Bound for Glory Series to determine the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, Joe finally ended his long losing streak on the August 4 edition of Impact Wrestling by defeating D'Angelo Dinero via submission, but the decision was reversed after he refused to release his hold following the match. Joe then accused TNA management of being against him and proclaimed that from now on the blood would be on their hands. After voicing his intention of ruining the Bound for Glory Series, Joe attacked its participants Devon, D'Angelo Dinero and rankings leader Crimson, who was forced to pull out of the tournament following the attack, after suffering a storyline ankle injury. On the final week of the Bound for Glory Series, Joe went to interfere in a match between Gunner and Rob Van Dam, but was stopped by guest color commentator Matt Morgan, who was sidelined with a torn pectoral muscle. This led to a brawl later in the evening, which ended with Joe hitting Morgan in the arm with a steel chair. On September 11 at No Surrender, Joe continued his losing streak as he was defeated by Morgan in a grudge match. On the following edition of Impact Wrestling, Joe ended his losing streak by defeating Morgan in a submission match.

The current USAF badge is designated by Air Force Instructions as the Navigator/Observer Badge and is issued to rated officers in both rating categories. In 2009, it was renamed as the Combat Systems Officer badge. The badge recognizes the Aeronautical Rating of Navigator, now Combat Systems Officer. The original Navigator badge was a successor to the Observer Badge, which was issued to military aviation navigators in the 1920s and 1930s. With an increase in aircraft technology, however, the Navigator, Bombardier, Engineer, and Gunner badges were created to recognize the advanced training and qualifications required of various aircrew members. The original Navigator badge was issued by the U.S. Army Air Forces and consisted of an armillary sphere centered between two wings. The badge was similar to the Aviator Badge and the Aircrew Badge. On July 26, 1947, the U.S. Air Force became a separate Branch of Service in the U.S. armed forces. and in late 1951 the Aircraft Observer, Navigator, and Bombardier badges were replaced with a single design, with the Air Force shield centered between two wings. At the same time, the aeronautical ratings of Navigator and Bombardier were merged into a single rating. The Aircraft Observer rating continued for Electronic Warfare Officers (EWOs), but eventually EWOs were awarded the Navigator-Bombardier aeronautical rating. The current USAF Navigator/Combat Systems Officer/Observer Badge is issued in three degrees: Basic, Senior, and Master. The degree of the Navigator/Combat Systems Officer/Observer Badge is determined by years of flying service in the Air Force and by logged hours of flight time or flying duty assignment time. The degrees are annotated by a star alone (senior) and a star and wreath (master) centered above the badge. There is also an astronaut version of the badge for those who have flown the NASA Space Shuttle and/or served on the International Space Station. Like its pilot astronaut counterpart, the Navigator/Observer Astronaut Badge is modified by the addition of the astronaut \\"shooting star\\" logo over the USAF shield on the wings. Navigator Astronauts or Combat Systems Officer Astronauts are those officers who have previously flown USAF aircraft as aeronautically rated Navigators / Combat Systems Officers and subsequently qualify as astronauts. A third variant of this same insignia is the Observer Astronaut. Today, the only personnel awarded the Observer rating are otherwise unrated U.S. Air Force officers who complete NASA Mission Specialist (astronaut) training and subsequently fly in space. For Navy and Marine Corps officers, the equivalent of the Navigator Badge / Combat Systems Officer badge is known as the Naval Flight Officer insignia and is similar to the Naval Aviator insignia for pilots, being differentiated by two crossed fouled anchors behind the insignia's United States shield, versus the single upright fouled anchor of their USN, USMC and USCG pilot counterparts. The Coast Guard briefly had Naval Flight Officers when they operated E-2 Hawkeye aircraft bailed from the Navy. There is also an astronaut version of the badge for those who have flown the NASA Space Shuttle and/or served on the International Space Station. Like its Naval Aviator Astronaut counterpart, the Naval Flight Officer Astronaut Badge is modified by the addition of the astronaut \\"shooting star\\" logo over the US shield on the wings. The Marine Corps also issues the Marine Aerial Navigator insignia to enlisted personnel trained as navigators for the KC-130. Unlike their USAF counterpart, the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard aviation insignia have no basic, senior or master/command degrees. The Army has no equivalent to the Navigator Badge.

He was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for portraying Jock Delves Broughton in White Mischief (1987). Early life Ackland was born in North Kensington, London, the son of Ruth (Izod) and Sydney Norman Ackland.Joss Ackland Biography (1928‚Äì). FilmReference.com. He was trained by Elsie Fogerty at the Central School of Speech and Drama, then based at the Royal Albert Hall, London.V&A;, Theatre and Performance Special Collections, Elsie Fogerty Archive, THM/324 Ackland and the former Rosemary Kirkcaldy, were married on 18 August 1951 when Ackland was 23 and she 22. She was an actress and Ackland wooed her when they appeared on stage together in Pitlochry, Scotland. The couple struggled initially as Ackland's acting career was in its infancy. They moved to Kenya, where Ackland managed a tea plantation for six months, but, deciding it was too dangerous, they moved to Cape Town, South Africa. Though they both obtained steady acting jobs in South Africa, after two years, they returned to England in 1957. Career Ackland joined the Old Vic, appearing alongside other notable actors including Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Tom Courtenay. Ackland worked steadily in television and film in the 1960s and 70s. He worked opposite Alec Guinness in the 1979 television serial Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, playing sporting journalist and intermittent British espionage operative Jerry Westerby, and his career advanced through the 1980s with important parts in such films as The Sicilian, Lethal Weapon 2, The Hunt for Red October and White Mischief. Ackland also appeared in Passion of Mind with Demi Moore and the two-part TV serial Hogfather based on Terry Pratchett's Discworld. He played C. S. Lewis in the television version of Shadowlands before it was adapted into a stage play starring Nigel Hawthorne and then a theatrical film with Anthony Hopkins in the same role.

Several years later, he said in an interview with the Radio Times that he appeared with the band purely because his grandchildren liked their music. In a 2001 interview with the BBC, Ackland said that he appeared in some \\"awful films\\" due to being a workaholic. He said that he \\"regretted\\" appearing in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey and the Pet Shop Boys music video, while lambasting former co-star Demi Moore as \\"not very bright or talented\\".\\"Joss Ackland admits 'awful' films.\\" BBC.com. In 2007 Ackland narrated and provided the voice for the Robert Garofalo biography film/documentary on the notorious occultist Aleister Crowley, titled In Search of the Great Beast 666 that was released on DVD. Also in 2007, Ackland appeared in the film How About You opposite Vanessa Redgrave, portraying a recovering alcoholic living in a residential home after being forced to retire and losing his wife to cancer. In 2008 he returned to the small screen as Sir Freddy Butler, a much married baronet, in the ITV1 show Midsomer Murders. The episode, entitled Vixens Run also featured veteran actress Si√¢n Phillips. In September 2013 Jonathan Miller directed a Gala Performance of William Shakespeare's King Lear at the Old Vic in London. Ackland played Lear. Ackland was well regarded in the acting community and known the world over as a prankster. Borrowing heavily from his role as Arjen Rudd in Lethal Weapon 2, Ackland was frequently overheard claiming that he had \\"diplomatic immunity\\" off-screen. Personal life Ackland and his wife Rosemary were married for 51 years. They had seven children and, as of May 2006, 32 grandchildren. Despite his filming taking him to far-flung locations, he said they never spent a night apart. In 1963, their house in Barnes caught fire. Rosemary saved their five children but broke her back when jumping from the bedroom window. She was told she would miscarry and never walk again, but later gave birth and, after two years in Stoke Mandeville Hospital, walked again. Their eldest son, Paul, died of a heroin overdose in 1982, aged 29. In 2000 Rosemary was diagnosed with motor neurone disease; she died on 25 July 2002.

Arguedas was an author of Spanish descent, with a rare fluency in the native Quechua language, gained by living in two Quechua households from the age of 7 to 11 - first in the indigenous servant quarters of his step-mother's home, then, escaping her \\"perverse and cruel\\" son, with an indigenous family approved by his father - who wrote novels, short stories, and poems in both Spanish and Quechua. Generally remembered as one of the most notable figures of 20th-century Peruvian literature, Arguedas is especially recognized for his intimate portrayals of indigenous Andean culture. Key in his desire to depict indigenous expression and perspective more authentically was his creation of a new language that blended Spanish and Quechua and premiered in his debut novel Yawar Fiesta. Despite a dearth of translations into English, the critic Martin Seymour-Smith has dubbed Arguedas \\"the greatest novelist of our time,\\" who wrote \\"some of the most powerful prose that the world has known.\\",Martin Seymour-Smith, The New Guide to Modern World Literature (New York: Peter Bedrick Books, 1985), pp. 949-950. Biography Jose Maria Arguedas was born on 18 January 1911 in Andahuaylas, a province in the southern Peruvian Andes. He was born into a well-off family, but his mother died when he was two years old. Because of the absence of his father, a lawyer who traveled frequently, and his bad relationship with his step-mother and step-brother, he comforted himself in the care of the family's indigenous servants, allowing him to immerse himself in the language and customs of the Andes, which came to form an important part of his personality. He went to primary school in San Juan de Lucana, Puquio, and Abancay, and completed his secondary studies in Ica, Huancayo, and Lima. He began studying at National University of San Marcos (Lima) in 1931; there he graduated with a degree in Literature. He later took up studies in Ethnology, receiving his degree in 1957 and his doctorate in 1963. Between 1937 and 1938 he was sent to prison for protesting an envoy sent to Peru by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Arguedas also worked for the Ministry of Education, where he put into practice his interests in preserving and promoting Peruvian culture, in particular traditional Andean music and dance. He was the director of the Casa de la Cultura (1963) and of the National Museum of History (1964‚Äì1966). Arguedas shot himself on November 29, 1969 in his office at the National Agrarian University in La Molina, leaving behind very specific instructions for his funeral, a diary depicting his depression, and a final unfinished manuscript, The Fox From Up Above and the Fox From Down Below. This work includes portions of Arguedas‚Äôs diary, memories of his distressing childhood, thoughts on Peruvian culture, and his reasons for suicide. He depicts his struggle between his desire to authentically illuminate the life of the Andean Indians and his personal anguish trapping him in depression: The title of the book originates in a Quechua myth that Arguedas translated into Spanish earlier in his life. ‚ÄúEl zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo‚Äù refers to the Quechua symbols for life and death, and modernity and tradition. Literary career Arguedas began his literary career by writing short stories about the indigenous environment familiar to him from his childhood. He wrote in a Spanish highly influenced by Quechua syntax and vocabulary. By the time he published his first novel in 1941, Yawar Fiesta (\\"Blood Fest\\"), he had begun to explore the theme that would interest him for the rest of his career: the clash between Western \\"civilization\\" and the Indigenous\\"traditional\\" way of life. He was thus considered part of the indigenista movement in South American literature, and continued to explore this theme in his next two books Los r√≠os profundos (\\"Deep Rivers,\\" 1958) and Todas las Sangres (\\"All the Bloods,\\" 1964). Yet he also was conscious of the simplistic portrayal of the indigenous peoples in other \\"indigenista\\" literature and worked hard to give the Andean Indians a true voice in his works. This effort was not always successful as some critics contend that Arguedas portrayed Indian characters as too gentle and childlike. Another theme in Arguedas' writing is the struggle of mestizos of Indian-Spanish descent and their navigation between the two seemingly separate parts of their identity. Many of his works also depicted the violence and exploitation of race relations in Peru's small rural towns and haciendas. Arguedas was moderately optimistic about the possibility of a rapprochement between the forces of \\"tradition\\" and the forces of \\"modernity\\" until the 1960s when he became more pessimistic. In his last (unfinished) work, El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo (\\"The Fox From Up Above and the Fox From Down Below,\\" 1969), he abandoned the realism of his earlier works for a more postmodern approach. This novel expressed his despair, caused by his fear that the \\"primitive\\" ways of the Indians could not survive the onslaught of modern technology and capitalism. At the same time that Arguedas was becoming more pessimistic about race relations in his country, younger Peruvian intellectuals became increasingly militant, often criticizing his work in harsh terms for his poetic, romanticized treatment of indigenous and rural life. An instance of the debate that ensued can be seen in the famous Mesa redonda sobre Todas las Sangres (Roundtable on All the Bloods) of 1965, in which Arguedas's penultimate novel was the object of blunt criticism from several social scientists at the Instituto de Estudios Peruanos.

Led by Dan Emmett, the original lineup consisted of Emmett, Billy Whitlock, Dick Pelham, and Frank Brower. After a successful try-out in the billiard parlor of the Branch Hotel on New York City's Bowery, the group is said to have premiered to a paying audience nearby at the Chatham Theatre, probably on January 31, 1843.Whitlock, who detailed the beginnings of the group, stated that the event was a benefit for Pelham. See Lawrence Hutton, \\"The Negro on the Stage,\\" Harpers New Monthly Magazine, June 1889, p. 140. Such an event occurred on 31 January. See The New York Herald, 31 January 1843, p. 3. The following day the Herald reported that the troupe would be appearing at the Bowery Amphitheatre, and an advertisement in the 6 February issue refers to their first performance that evening.New York Times, May 19, 1907: 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels; Interesting Reminiscenses of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago: \\"In nearly all the playhouses at least one minstrel appeared on the stage, but there were no regular bands or minstrel troupes until Dan Emmet, Billy Whitlock, Frank Brower and Dick Pelham got together and organized the original Virginia troupe, which opened up at the Chatham Theatre... That was back in 1842.\\" They followed with a brief run at the Bowery Amphitheater in early February before an expanded schedule of venues.  Early beginnings  Dan Emmett and Frank Brower both toured with The Cincinnati Circus Company during the spring of 1841. It was there that their friendship first began. Dan learned to play the banjo, and Frank accompanied him in the new song \\"Old Tar River.\\" In early November 1841, the playbills announced Dan Emmett as a performer. Dan and Frank then turned to New York City. As they were already quite respected, it did not take long for them to gain notoriety in New York. They began performing at the Chatham Theater with a third performer named Pierce. It is assumed that Frank and Pierce danced to Dan's banjo accompaniment, which sometimes included vocal lines from one of the performers who wasn't dancing. Frank briefly left the group in the middle of December 1842. Emmett and Pierce continued to perform and were billed as \\"the renowned Ethopian Minstrel and his Little Darkey Ariel.\\" A few weeks later, Dan Emmett and Frank Brower teamed up with Dill Whitlock and Dick Pelham, who were also popular blackface comedians. Bill Whitlock describes their formation as a happy accident, as Dan Emmett and Bill Whitlock were practicing together, and Frank Brower and Dick Pelham happened to come by and visit, joining in the practice session. After practicing for a while, they took their instruments down to the Branch Hotel and performed for the first time as the Virginia Minstrels.  Troupe members  Dan Emmett - founding member and Bones (instrument) player, as well as banjo. Most famous for writing the song Dixie (song). Frank Brower - toured with Dan in the circus, and would commonly accompany him in acts. Mainly a banjo player. Billy Whitlock - would typically practice fiddle with Dan before he started the troupe. Was a large success in New York before the start of the troupe. Dick Pelham - most established dancer out of the troupe. Played several instruments as well.  Changes to the minstrel show  The main difference between the Virginia Minstrels and earlier minstrel shows is the type of performance that the audience experienced. While they weren't the first blackface performers to band together and present a show, they were the first to present a concert. The way that they presented and marketed themselves resembled that of the Hutchinson Family Singers, a group that was making more than ten times minstrel troupes were for each performance.  Critical reception  The change of perception from being a variety show to being a concert afforded the Virginia Minstrels with patrons of a slightly upper class. Their work was deemed as refined and a breath of fresh air in the New York scene. One critic wrote: \\"Chaste, Pleasing and Elegant!\\" - \\"The Virginia Minstrels, who have been giving their novel and refined concerts at the Temple in Boston, and have been so liberally patronized by the elite of that city, beg most respectfully to announce to the Ladies and Gentlemen of Worcester, that they intend giving their last concert at Brinley Hall, on Wednesday eve'g, Mar. 22\\" The editorial that accompanied this notice stated \\"The harmony and skill with which the banjo, violin, castinets, and tambourine are blended by these truly original minstrels, in their Ethiopian characters, is a redeeming feature to this species of amusement, and cannot fail of making it acceptable to the most refined and sensitive audience.\\"  Significant works  Unlike earlier blackface acts that featured solo singers or dancers, the Virginia Minstrels appeared as a group in blackface and what would become iconic costumes and performed more elaborate shows. In March 1843 they appeared in Welch's Olympic Circus as part of an equestrian act.New York Herald, 1 March 1843, p. 3. Although they primarily appeared within a larger schedule of entertainment in their earliest months, they surely were the first minstrels to also be hired to perform by themselves at smaller venues. Among other things, they are credited with the songs \\"Jimmy Crack Corn\\" and \\"Old Dan Tucker\\", which passed into American folk culture.

Based on Jos√© de Alencar's eponymous novel Indianism (in ) is a Brazilian literary and artistic movement that reached its peak during the first stages of Romanticism, though it had been present in Brazilian literature since the Baroque period. In Romantic contexts, it is called \\"the first generation of Brazilian Romanticism\\", being succeeded by the \\"Ultra- Romanticism\\" and the \\"Condorism\\". Historical context After the independence of Brazil from Portugal in 1822, a heavy wave of nationalism spread through the Brazilian people. Inspired by this, poets and writers began to search for an entity that could represent and personify the newly created Brazilian nation. The Last Tamoio, by Rodolfo Amoedo Since there was no Middle Ages in Brazil, it could not be the knight, as in the European chivalric romances; it could not be the Portuguese man either, since Brazilians still held resentment for the years of colonization; it could not be the black man either, since the mentality of the time did not allow it. Influenced by Enlightenment ideals, especially works by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the \\"noble savage\\" myth, the authors chose the Brazilian Indian to represent the new nation. Characteristics Indianist works are characterized by always having an Indian as the protagonist. The poetry is very patriotic and nationalistic, exalting Brazilian fauna, flora, riches and people.

The plaintiff and the defendant ask the court to enter into their agreement, and the court maintains supervision over the implementation of the decree in monetary exchanges or restructured interactions between parties. It is similar to and sometimes referred to as an antitrust decree, stipulated judgment, or consent judgment. Consent decrees are frequently used by federal courts to ensure that businesses and industries adhere to regulatory laws in areas such as antitrust law, employment discrimination, and environmental regulation. Legal process The process of introducing a consent decree begins with negotiation. One of three things happens: a lawsuit is filed and the parties concerned reach an agreement prior to adjudication of the contested issues; a lawsuit is filed and actively contested, and the parties reach an agreement after the court has ruled on some issues; or the parties settle their dispute prior to the filing of a lawsuit and they simultaneously file a lawsuit and request that the court agree to the entry of judgment. The court is meant to turn this agreement into a judicial decree. In many cases, the request for entry of a consent decree prompts judges to sign the documents presented then and there. In some cases, however, such as criminal cases, the judge must make some sorts of assessments before the court‚Äôs entry of the agreement as a consent decree. The usual consent decree is not self-executing. A consent decree is implemented when the parties transform their agreements from paper to reality. The judge who signed the decree may have no involvement or may monitor the implementation. The judge can only step in to assist in enforcement if a party complains to the court that an opponent has failed to perform as agreed. In this case, the offending party would be committed for contempt. Decrees by consent are more binding than those issued , or against an unwilling party, which are subject to modification by the same court, and reversal by higher courts. The decree issued by consent cannot be modified, except by consent. If the decree was obtained by means of fraud or given by mistake, it may be set aside by a court. Errors of law or of inferences from the facts may invalidate it completely. Typically, a consent decree dispenses with the necessity of having proof in court, since by definition the defendant agrees to the order. Thus, the use of a consent decree does not involve a sentence or an admission of guilt. Likewise, the consent decree prevents a finding of facts, so the decree cannot be pleaded as . History Because judicial decrees are part of government civil enforcement in settlements that two parties typically agree to before litigation is filed, they act as a hybrid between a judicial order and a settlement without a party conceding criminal responsibility. Frederick Pollock and Frederic Maitland describe how courts during the twelfth century of Medieval Europe used \\"fines\\" as a form of court orders to settle land disputes among litigants with the punitive power and legitimacy of courts through the use of consent decree. In the United States, 19th and 20th century legal treatises show that consent decrees and the role of the court in the parties' settlement was ambiguous. The 1947 Corpus Juris Secundum declares that although consent decrees are \\"not the judgment of the court\\", they do have the \\"force and effect of a judgment\\". =Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure= The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which both went into effect in 1938, lay many of the legal foundations that govern the use of consent decree. Creating space for courts, which are important actors in implementing a consent decree, to enter into a settlement, Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gives federal district courts the power to approve class action settlements as long as they are \\"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\\" Rule 54(b) defines judgment, which refers to consent decree, and allows the court to \\"direct entry of a final judgment\\" when multiple parties are involved, and Rule 58 describes the procedure of how parties may enter judgment. Additionally, Rule 60 describes conditions under which parties can be granted \\"relief from a judgment or order\\" (such as a consent decree). As Rule 48 in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure stipulates that dismissals in criminal cases may not occur without \\"leave of court\\", Rule 41 allows, if all the parties agree, the court to dismiss any suit besides class action suits, shareholder derivative suits, or bankruptcy action. Many of these rules create the space for consent decree by establishing the role of judges within the settlement of two parties. =Precedents= Many of the early court cases involving consent decree set precedents for the roles that judges would play in the negotiating, approving, interpreting, and modifying a settlement between two parties. The role of the judge in regard to consent decree wavers between \\"rubber stamping\\" versus applying their own judgments to a proposed settlement. In 1879, Pacific Railroad of Missouri v. Ketchum bound the court's role in consent decrees to simply supporting to an agreement that parties have already established on their own. . In regard to antitrust decrees, the first consent decree used in antitrust regulation under the Sherman Antitrust Act was Swift & Co. v. United States.. With Swift & Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that a consent decree could be modified or terminated only when new developments over time bring out a \\"grievous wrong\\" in how the ruling of the consent decree affects the parties of the suit. The Supreme Court supported this limited flexibility of consent decrees in United States v. Terminal R.R. Ass'n: \\"[A] decree will not be expanded by implication or intendment beyond the meaning of its terms when read in the light of the issues and the purposes for which the suit was brought.\\". In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., that to promote finality, a court's changes to consent a decree should be rare‚Äîbut the courts can modify a consent decree or frame injunctive relief to ensure the litigation achieves its purpose.. Before a judge can enter a consent decree, according to the rulings in Firefighters v. City of Cleveland. and Firefighters v. Stotts. they must have subject-matter jurisdiction, and they cannot modify a consent decree when one of the parties object. The Supreme Court's position on how much authority a judge possesses in regard to influencing how the settlement is agreed upon is conflicting. In Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, the Supreme Court ruled that consent decrees \\"have attributes both of contracts and of judicial decrees\\", so consent decrees should be treated differently for different purposes. In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,. the Supreme Court decided that courts could take into account the changing times and circumstances for more flexibility in the administration of consent decrees. In regard to litigation in performance rights organizations such as American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and Broadcast Music, Inc. in United States v. ASCAP, which began in 1941, the Department of Justice used consent decrees (which are amended according to the times and technology) to regulate how they issued blanket licenses to ensure that trade is not restrained and that the prices of licenses would not be competitive. Most frequent uses =Antitrust law= Violations of antitrust law are typically resolved through consent decrees, which began to be more widely used after 1914 with the enactment of the Clayton Antitrust Act. This act began to address the complexities of antitrust economic regulation by recognizing the use of consent decrees as a method for the enforcement of federal antitrust legislation. In amending the antitrust statutes laid out in the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) and its supplement, the Clayton Antitrust Act (1914), the Tunney Act further specified how consent decrees could be used by establishing that the courts must demonstrate that consent decrees serve the \\"public interest\\" in antitrust cases filed by the Justice Department. In regard to antitrust decrees, the first consent decree used in antitrust regulation under the Sherman Antitrust Act was Swift & Co. v. United States in which the Court used its power under the Commerce Clause to regulate the Chicago meat trust as an unlawful economic monopoly. In Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States, the government used consent decrees to dissolve the horizontal monopoly that John D. Rockefeller had established. Other examples of antitrust consent decrees can be found in a wide range of areas, including their involvement in corporations specializing in technology, the film industry,. and the motor vehicle industry.. =Structural reform= School desegregation The effort to desegregate American public schools began in 1954 with Brown v. Board of Education. This landmark Supreme Court case established that racial segregation of children in public schools was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires that states must not \\"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\\".. To properly enforce this legislation, the Supreme Court allowed district courts to use desegregation decrees obligating states to actively transition into racially nondiscriminatory school systems, with \\"all deliberate speed\\".. Since the original decree did not include specific ways this could be done, beginning with Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education in 1971, the Supreme Court specifically defined the objective as eliminating \\"all vestiges of state imposed segregation\\". within school systems, including the limited use of busing,Swann, 402 U.S. at 29‚Äì31. racial quotas,Swann, 402 U.S. at 22‚Äì25. the creation of magnet schools and judicial placement of new schools, and the redrawing of school attendance zones.Swann, 402 U.S. at 27‚Äì29. To stop judicial intervention in schools and end the consent decree through a court order, districts must demonstrate desegregation within six criteria defined in the Green v. County School Board of New Kent County. ruling ‚Äì which include, student assignment, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities.Green, 391 U.S. at 435. Police use of violence Consent decrees have been signed by a number of cities concerning their police departments' use-of-force policies and practices, including New Orleans, Oakland, Los Angeles (whose consent decree was lifted in 2013), Ferguson, Missouri,https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/the-damage-done-by-jeff- sessions-last-act-as-ag-1412616771933 Seattlehttps://www.seattlemet.com/news- and-city-life/2020/07/seattle-s-decade-of-attempts-to-fix-the-police-timeline and Albuquerque. =Public law= Consent decrees have been used to remedy various social issues that deal with public and private organizations, where a large number of people are often concerned even if they may not be members of either party involved. Examples have included Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and environmental safety provisions. Actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination by employers on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. Most often, the remedies to workplace discrimination carried out under this Act take place in the form of consent decrees, where employers may have to provide monetary awards or introduce policies and programs that eliminate and prevent future discrimination. These may include decrees that require the creation of new recruitment and hiring procedures to gain a more diverse pool of job applicants, upgrading job and promotion assignment systems, or offering training programs focusing on discrimination and diversityButler v. Home Depot, Case Number: C 95-2182 SI; C 94-4335 SI, pp. 33-36 Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was created to be a major advocate and enforcer of the previously mentioned Title VII remedies. In a landmark decision in 1973, the EEOC, Department of Labor and AT&T; compromised on a consent decree that phased out discrimination within recruiting, hiring and employment methods in regard to minorities and women. This established a precedent for other large, private U.S companies to avoid litigation and government oversight by creating decrees in cooperation with Title VII. Americans with Disabilities Act The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was a civil rights law passed in 1990 that prohibits discrimination and ensures that people with disabilities have equal access to the opportunities and benefits available to the wider American population., , and Institutions that violate the requirements of the ADA enter consent decrees typically resulting in a payment from the corporation to those wronged, which may serve to discourage future discrimination, in addition to a change in policy to avoid future payouts. Examples of altered practices through the use of a decree have included restructuring building property or the removal of barriers to allow for physical accessibility for all persons, providing supplemental communication tools such as sign language interpreters for those that are hard of hearing, and eliminating discriminatory practices against those that have a disability. Environmental law Consent decrees have been used to alter environmental policy, one example being the \\"Flannery Decision\\", or the Toxics Consent Decree, entered into by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.Natural Resources Defense Council v. Train, No. 74 Civ. 4617 (S.D.N.Y., March 1976) This decree, signed in 1976, highly restructured the way the EPA dealt with harmful substances by requiring the agency to list and regulate 65 toxic pollutants and to regulate pollutant discharges on an industry-by-industry basis (i.e., effluent guidelines regulations) rather than by singular pollutants. This decree went on to shape the regulations and administration procedures of water policy within the United States, particularly through the Clean Water Act. Effects Scholars find advantages and disadvantages to using the consent decree. In addition, consent decrees can affect those outside of the litigants, such as third parties and public interests. =Advantages and disadvantages= The following are advantages of using consent decrees: * Save financial costs of litigation: Consent decrees forgo a court trial that allows for both parties and the courts to save legal expenses. * Save the time of prolonged litigation: The parties and the courts save the time it would take for a court trial to occur and the courts more quickly clear their dockets. * Ability to get results of a trial: The parties are able to obtain similar results of a court trial, specifically where a change is required to appease the dispute. * Parties avoid the uncertainties of a trial: Consent decrees forgo a trial and its unknown outcome, the necessity of proof, and any guilt is taken for granted (because no one is accused by the consent decree). * Parties have control of the remedial plan: Consent decrees allow both parties to have greater latitude in deciding how to remedy their issues. This is an advantage \\"because the parties, not the court, determine the remedy, [and] the assumption is that the remedy is better suited to the parties' needs\\". *More compliance and authoritativeness: Both parties more voluntarily implement their agreements if obtained by consent than by force. Moreover, to fail to act under the consent decree seems to be more a violation of the \\"law\\" than if under a contract because the parties are \\"bound\\" and not \\"obligated\\" by the consent decree. Its authoritativeness is reinforced by the practice that a return to court for a consent decree has a priority in the court queue. *Sustained judicial oversight and interpretation: Courts can supervise that consent decrees are upheld for an indefinite period of time. In contrast, the following are disadvantages of using consent decrees: *Duration: Some argue that \\"consent decrees often last for too long a period\\". Although consent decrees are a solution to a particular issue, the context around that issue or the issue itself may change. However, the consent decree is neither as easy to modify nor adapt and thus can become inadequate. *Ambition: Consent decrees can be an avenue for those seeking to enact a future-oriented change that is more general and not case-specific. Consent decrees are thus used \\"as a tool of enforcement [that is] less expensive, and sometimes more far-reaching, than adjudication,\\" especially in antitrust cases and those involving public institutions. *Complexity: Consent decrees can be complex in questions of modification, either before or after it is enacted: \\"the decree issued by consent cannot be modified, except by consent. Only where the consent has been obtained by fraud or given by mistake will a bill be entertained to set it aside\\". *Ambiguity: There is ambiguity in the source of power of the consent decree, the role of judges, and the guidelines for a consent decree. Some see that \\"neither judges, lawyers, nor parties know exactly what they give or get when a consent decree is entered ... [which may bear] testimony to the negative consequences of the ambiguity that surrounds consent decrees\\". =Third parties and public interests= The consent decree can impact those outside of the parties, who resolve their disputes with a consent decree, especially in settling institutional reform and antitrust cases. From Rufo v. Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail and Swift & Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court acknowledges that \\"the effects of the decree on third parties and the public interest should be taken into account when determining whether or not a change in fact warrants ... the decree\\". There is criticism that \\"the antitrust consent decree is an opaque form of government regulation that operates without many of the checks and balances that constrain and shape ordinary regulatory programs\\". So, some argue that the use of consent decrees in antitrust cases and with public institutions can negatively affect third parties and public interests.

This rivalry can extend to both academics and athletics, the latter being typically better known to the general public. These schools place an added emphasis on emerging victorious in any event that includes their rival. This may include the creation of a special trophy or other commemoration of the event. While many of these rivalries have arisen spontaneously, some have been created by college officials in efforts to sell more tickets and support their programs. Definition of a sports rivalry Rivalries traverse many different fields within society. A rivalry develops from the product of competition and ritualism between different parties. A rivalry is defined as \\"a perceptual categorizing process in which actors identify which states are sufficiently threatening competitors\\". Ritualism is \\"a series of ... iterated acts or performances that are ... famous in terms 'not entirely encoded by the performer'; that is, they are imbued by meanings external to the performer\\". Everyone that is part of the sports event in some capacity becomes a part of the ritualism. Teams get together before the game to warm up, coaches shake hands with each other, captains have a determinant of who gets the ball first, everyone stands during the national anthem, the fans sit in specific areas, they make certain gestures with their hands throughout the game, they wear specific gear that is associated with the team, and they have the same post- game practices every game of every season of every year. It is through this consistency of playing the same teams yearly that \\"these rivalries have shown remarkable staying power\\". Specifically, it is society's drive to disrupt these original rituals that start rivalries. Horst Helle says, \\"society needs a particular quantitative relationship of harmony and disharmony, association and competition, favour and disfavour, in order to take shape in a specific way\\". Society is drawn to this in sports because this is a principal characteristic in everyday life, which can be seen in historic religious rivalries, such as the contemporary example of sectarianism in Glasgow. Within an area, differences between two types of people can drive the start of a rivalry. Competition and support keep the rivalry going. In sports, competition tests who has better skill and ability at the time of the game through play. Many rivalries persist because the competition is between two teams that have similar abilities. Spectators gravitate towards competitive rivalries because they are interesting to watch and unpredictable. Society follows competitions because competitions influence \\"the unity of society\\". Being loyal to one team in a rivalry brings a sense of belonging to a community of supporters that are hoping that the team they are rooting for wins. The fans of the two different teams do not sit next to each other because this disrupts the community. In a similar way, competition displays an indirect way of fighting. Society does not condone direct fighting as a way of getting something so this is the most passive aggressive way of fighting. Because this is an acceptable practice, there are many supporters of competition as they fuel a way for the people to participate in a rivalry without the consequences of fighting. However, when the competition is not enough in sports and the tensions are high fighting does ensue. Important contributors that fuel a rivalry An important precursor to having a rivalry is having intense competitive play between two sports teams within the ritualistic structure of the game. A competition is \\"a form of struggle fought by means of objective performances, to the advantage of a third [party]\\", which in sports is driven by the team dynamic, and external outlets such as the fans and the media. These external outlets give rivalries more distinctive importance. An example of a rivalry that embodies this is the Yankees‚ÄìRed Sox rivalry. =The team dynamic= In such sports as basketball and football there is a stress on the importance of teamwork. This is so because the team is a smaller society that needs to function properly. This means that they need good communication and get necessary goals accomplished for the team. Because of this, the individual on the team is seen as less important than the group as everyone works toward the goal of making the group the best it can possibly be. Players do this \\"in the form of obedience to authority, group loyalty, and the willingness to sacrifice for the good of the group.\\" =The spectators= The spectators, also known as fans, of sporting events are the largest population associated with the event. Fans exhibit \\"intangible feelings of pride, solidarity, and pleasure\\" for a particular team and brand loyalty, which means that they \\"heavily identify[y] with a particular team or university and have shown that the self-esteem of these ardent fans can be affected by their team's success in competition\\". This is important in rivalries because fans can determine the outcome of the game and the overall mood throughout the game. The fans have a lot of power because of this fact and therefore possess indirect power and determination on the outcome of the game. =The media= The media connect the team, with the fans and the rest of the world. \\"The media do[es not] 'tell it like it is.' Rather, they tell it in a way that supports the interests of those who benefit from cultural commitments to competition, productivity, and material success.\\" This is known as consumerism because the media influences society's emotions to think of the rivalries in a way that will get people to be as passionate about the game as they want to be. It is spectators' enjoyment of sports and the associated rivalries that drive media sport consumption. Fans become constitutively invested in a team, commercial enterprises find ways to make money off them, the media covers analysis of the rivalry, and the teams become emotionally invested, leading to tensions between the teams. Australia * Prince Alfred College and Saint Peter's College Each sport has an annual intercollegiate showdown between the two prestigious schools, known as the \\"Intercol\\". These are considered by the two colleges to be the most important games of the season, and the fiercely fought matches draw big crowds of students and old scholars from both schools. The Intercols have been played for over 100 years. The Cricket Intercollegiate match has been competed in since 1878. According to Richard Sproull this is \\"the oldest unbroken annual contest in the history of cricket\\" (Weekend Australian 5/6 December 1992). For the sport of rowing, the intercol is competed during South Australia's 'Head of the River Regatta', on the second to last Saturday of the first school term, with one of the two school's taking out the statewide title nearly every year since its beginning. * Nudgee College and Gregory Terrace In 1991, the following legend was printed in the Centennial Rugby Programme, dubbed ‚Äì \\"The Battle of The Colours\\", for the 100th anniversary of the annual Nudgee vs Terrace rugby match. The legend has it that the two St Joseph's, who both wore the Christian Brothers traditional Blue and White, played off in a Rugby game to decide who would keep the prestigious colours. As the story goes Nudgee won the match seeing them keep the colours with Gregory Terrace changing to the now famed Red and Black. This fierce rivalry has continued ever since in every sport yet Rugby continues to stand head and shoulders above the rest, with crowds of up to 10 000 attending First XV fixtures. As two of the biggest Rugby schools in Australia the schools also compete for the St Joseph's Cup. * Jane Franklin Hall, John Fisher College and Christ College Intercollege Sport has been played between Jane Franklin Hall, Christ College and St. John Fisher College for many years, with many sports played, most importantly Rugby, Cricket and Australian Rules football. These matches are fiercely contested, indeed playing a part in the winning Rugby side is considered the crowning achievement in ones time at college. Jane Franklin Hall has had the edge in sporting prowess over the years in most sports ‚Äì with its winning streak in Soccer extending back to the mid 1980s, for example ‚Äì apart from Rugby which is very tightly contested, with Christ College coming out the victor more often over recent years. Each year, the colleges compete for the Intercollege Cup, which is decided based on points earned from sporting results. Each sport is allocated various points for first, second and third, and weighted to reward the college that wins the more prestigious sports of Rugby, Football and Cricket, with Rugby given the highest weighting. Belgium * Universit√© catholique de Louvain and Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles. * Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Rivalry started in the 1830s when the Free University of Brussels was established as a non-religious and freethinking university whereas the old Catholic University of Leuven ‚Äì refounded in 1835 ‚Äì remained under Church control. The rivalry survived the division of the two original foundations into separate Dutch-speaking and French-speaking establishments, in 1968 and 1970 respectively. Nowadays control of the Church over the two catholic universities has diminished and they are largely pluralist, accepting students and professors from all religions and backgrounds, but the rivalry with the two secular universities in Brussels continues. This rivalry finds expression mainly among academics and traditional student activities as intercollegiate sports remain largely developed in Belgium. Canada * Carleton University and University of Ottawa These two schools are cross-city rivals in Ottawa, Ontario and have historically had the largest football rivalry in the country. The Carleton Ravens and the Ottawa Gee-Gees played the annual Panda Game from 1955 to 1998, which consistently garnered a national spotlight and was renowned for its size and popularity. The Panda Game was absent for 15 years after Carleton shut down their football program, but was revived in 2013 when Carleton restarted their football program. The rivalry is also on display on the basketball court, where both schools' teams are among the best in Canada. * University of Western Ontario and Queen's University These two universities have one of the oldest rivalries in Canada. Western, located in London, Ontario and Queen's, located in Kingston, Ontario are two of the older schools in Ontario and are both notable academic institutions. The rivalry is ever present in Football when the two schools meet every year. * University of Western Ontario and Wilfrid Laurier University * University of Toronto, York University, and Ryerson University Historically, Toronto and York compete at the Annual Red & Blue Bowl Football Game, which attracts alumni and many students from both universities. Other rivalries exist in hockey, rowing and academics, which both score quite well. All three schools are located in the city of Toronto * University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University Cross-city rivals located in Vancouver, British Columbia. See Shrum Bowl * University of Winnipeg and University of Manitoba * Queen's University and McGill University * Queen's University and Royal Military College of Canada * Wilfrid Laurier University and University of Waterloo * Georgian College and Durham College * Georgian College and Sheridan College Chile * Universidad de Chile and Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile Mainland China * Peking University and Tsinghua University: Known as the Pekhua Rivalry, they are the two best universities in mainland China, and they are located next to each other. * Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Fudan University: These two Shanghai-based reputable universities frequently participate in a variety of joint sports competitions, including bicycle racing, track and field, soccer, and dragon boat racing. * Sichuan University and Chongqing University: Chengdu, the home of Sichuan University, and Chongqing, the home of Chongqing University, are rival cities in southwestern China due to historical and geographic reasons, and the relationship between these two cities leads to the rivalry between these two flagship universities of their areas (Similar to Michigan-Ohio State rivalry). * Zhejiang University and Nanjing University: Two flagships in Yangtze River's delta area. * Nankai University and Tianjin University: Two best schools in the city of Tianjin. * Hefei University of Technology and University of Science and Technology of China: Rivals for historical reasons. * Sichuan International Studies University and Southwest University of Political Science & Law * Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Wuhan University * South China University of Technology and Sun Yat-Sen University * Nanjing University and Southeast University * Renmin University and Peking University France High schools & Preparatory classes: Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand and Lyc√©e Henri IV in Paris, which are commonly seen as the most prestigious public high schools. Business Schools: ESSEC Business School and HEC Paris have been fierce rivals with HEC topping most rankings and ESSEC often coming second. However, ESSEC has long been considered an entrepreneurial powerhouse, more dynamic and open-minded than HEC, whilst the latter has constantly been accused of snobbish attitudes due to the elitist mindset of its student population. Whether either assumptions are true or false, those two schools have produced the elite of French business circles, alongside the other \\"Parisian\\" business school ESCP Europe, which is usually ranked third in France. Engineering Schools: The famous engineering schools, such as ParisTech members, usually compete in national sports tournaments, but also in technological competitions such as the French Robotics Cup or the Mash Marathon. In these situations some of the schools chose to form alliances, like Sup√©lec and Arts et M√©tiers ParisTech that build common robots. Other Schools: The \\"Crit√©rium\\" of the Institut d'√©tudes politiques (IEP) is an annual multi-sport competition between the 9 IEPs. It is traditionally held on the last weekend of March with the host city changing every year. It is the occasion for the IEPs located in French regions to challenge the more prestigious IEP Paris (known as \\"Sciences Po\\"). A final opposing Paris to, for example, Lyon would see students from all over France cheering for Lyon, especially with the anthem \\"Province unie, tous contre Paris !\\" (\\"Province united, all against Paris !\\", the \\"province\\" being a somewhat pejorative term used to designate any place in France outside of Paris). The Paris students would respond by boasting their status as a Grande √©cole and √©lite institution. Greece * University of Macedonia and Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Thessaloniki.

United Kingdom =Universities= Oxford and Cambridge have a rivalry which dates back to the 13th century; see Oxford and Cambridge rivalry, Blue (university sport), the Boat Race, The Varsity Game, The Varsity Match, the Rugby League Varsity Match, and the Ice Hockey Varsity Match. Colleges within each University are also known to nurture keen rivalries, such as that between Oriel College, Oxford and Pembroke College, Oxford, centred around rowing, that between Exeter College, Oxford and Jesus College, Oxford, both being directly opposite each other on Turl Street, or that between Brasenose College, Oxford and Lincoln College, Oxford, one of two pairs of \\"semi-detached\\" colleges in Oxbridge ‚Äì the other being Balliol College and Trinity College in Broad Street, Oxford. Another keen rivalry is that between St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and the Queen's College, Oxford, dating back to the time when the Queen's College owned St Edmund Hall. In Cambridge, rivalries exist between St John's and Trinity, two of the richest colleges of the university and all of Oxbridge. Rivalries have also been established between Colleges in Oxford and Cambridge, such as that between Robinson College, Cambridge and St Catherine's College, Oxford. University College London and King's College London have a rivalry that has been a part of London life for nearly two centuries. It can be traced to their foundation in the 1820s when King's College was established as an Anglican alternative to the secular University College. The third-oldest university in England debate between the two universities and other parties continues to this day. King's College London and University of Bradford also have a departmental rivalry. King's College London's War Studies department faces Bradford University's Peace Studies department, in an annual football match for the 'Tolstoy Cup'. The rivalry between 'War' and 'Peace' studies teams is one of the great sporting rivalries, being featured at number four on the Financial Times list of \\"Great College Sports Rivalries\\". Lancaster University and University of York have a rivalry which has lasted since the formation of the universities at similar times in the 1960s. There is an annual sports competition between the university named the Roses Tournament, which takes its name after the 15th Century civil war between the House of York and the House of Lancaster. The first event was held in 1965 and has been an annual tradition ever since. Northumbria University and Newcastle University have a rivalry based upon the close geographical relationship attributed between both universities, with Northumbria University being situated extremely close to the older Newcastle University in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1994 the Stan Calvert Cup was instituted as a multi-sport competition between the two universities; but in 2018 Newcastle University decided to withdraw from the cup for the foreseeable future. University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University have a rivalry being the cities two principal universities with the battle for the 'varsity cup' taking place every year when over 1,000 students from both universities compete in over 15 different sports. University of Essex and University of East Anglia have an annual competition known amongst the students as \\"Derby Day\\", as well as competing academically. =Schools= * Edinburgh Academy and Merchiston Castle School Since 1858 the oldest continuous rugby fixture in the world. As of 2008 Edinburgh Academy has produced 103 rugby internationalists and Merchiston 62. They compete annually for the Sesquicentenary Trophy. * Eton College and Harrow School, an annual cricket match that has been held at Lord's Cricket Ground since 1805. * Merchant Taylors' School and St. Paul's School, historical London rivalry that weakened when St. Paul's moved to Hammersmith and Merchant Taylors' moved to Moor Park. * Merchant Taylors' School and Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, geographically close (with both located in southern Hertfordshire): annual sports fixtures played, with cricket matches having been played at Lord's. * Merchant Taylors' School and The Skinners' School, stemming from the fact that the two schools' parent livery companies alternate places in the City of London's order of precedence each year. * The Perse School and The Leys School Annual matches in all sports. Until The Perse moved site in 1960 the two schools were situated about 500 metres apart, joined by Lensfield Road. * Royal Grammar School Worcester and King's School, Worcester in the \\"Modus Cup\\". * Westminster School and St. Paul's School * Bablake School and King Henry VIII School, Coventry as sister schools have annual sporting competitions which culminate in the annual rugby match played at Butts Park. * Maidstone Grammar School for Girls and Invicta Grammar School, Maidstone * St. Paul's School and King's College School, primarily in rugby but also in other sports including football (soccer) and cricket. * King's College School and Royal Grammar School, Guildford, primarily in rugby where they compete for the Hillers-Hutchison Shield. * The King's School, Canterbury and King's College School, one of the oldest fixtures in each school's fixture list. * Tonbridge School and Wellington College, more prominently in rugby, the rugby season finishes with the annual fixture between the two schools. * Ravensbourne School, Bromley, Bishop Justus Church of England School and Ravens Wood School * The Skinners' School and The Judd School, both founded by the Honorable Skinners' Company, rivalry in rugby and academia * George Heriot's School and George Watsons College, rivalry between schools extends back to the 1700s due to both schools being on opposite sides of Lauriston Road from each other. The rivalry was at a high during the mid 1800s with parties from both schools conducting raids on each other and a wave of \\"thefts, violence, mass riots and bullying\\". This violence and rivalry subsided with the relocating from Watson's and the change to both School becoming day schools rather than boarding. Today the rivalry extends only to the sports pitch although there is rumour of a raid in the 1970/80s of a group of Watsonian finding themselves in the Heriots cafeteria with several stink bombs.https://www.george- heriots.com/assets/0002/5144/Quadrangle_Spring_2013.pdf * Epsom College and St John's School, Leatherhead, have a rivalry in sports, especially rugby and hockey. United States School rivalries are important in the United States, especially in intercollegiate sports. Rivalries within conferences are list below. Some rivalries, such as the Indiana‚ÄìKentucky rivalry, take place between two schools from different conferences. The Caltech‚ÄìMIT rivalry is unusual for both the geographic distance between the schools (their campuses are separated by about 2500 miles and are on opposite coasts of the United States) and the focus on elaborate pranks rather than sporting events. =ACC rivalries= Basketball and football are typically the hot-button sports in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), though most rivalries bridge across all sports.

The conference, while centered in the northeast, is also geographically diverse, stretching from Nebraska to New England. Current rivalries include: * Butler Bulldogs and Xavier Musketeers ‚Äì among the most successful Division I men's basketball programs in the 21st century, the two schools were founding members of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, and were also two of the three Midwestern schools invited to join the Big East at its relaunch in 2013. * DePaul Blue Demons and Marquette Golden Eagles ‚Äì originally Division I independents, both joined Conference USA and the original Big East at the same time, and are among the \\"Catholic 7\\" that formed the current Big East after breaking away from the former members of the conference who all sponsored Division I Football Bowl Subdivision-level football. One of several sports rivalries involving teams from Chicago and Milwaukee, alongside the Brewers‚ÄìCubs rivalry and (by proxy) the Bears‚ÄìPackers rivalry. The rivalry reached its zenith in the late 1970s, when both DePaul and Marquette were national powers. However, the rivalry has, as of late, heavily favored Marquette, with the Milwaukee school winning approximately four out of every five meetings since the early 1990s. * Georgetown Hoyas and St. John's Red Storm' ‚Äî these two \\"Catholic 7\\" schools, neither of which plays Division I FBS football (Georgetown plays in Division I FCS, and St. John's has no football program), had their basketball teams rise to prominence in the 1980s, having numerous meetings that impacted the NCAA Championship as well as the Big East title. Both teams were known for their charismatic coaches, John Thompson at Georgetown and Lou Carnesecca at St. John's. Rivalry has declined in recent years. This rivalry has also influenced other sports, as the two schools' baseball teams opened Citi Field on March 29, 2009 with the third game of a three-game series that started at Georgetown. The Hoyas won the game, and the series. * Georgetown‚ÄìUConn men's basketball rivalry ‚Äî first game played between the two schools took place on December 22, 1958. * Georgetown Hoyas and Villanova Wildcats ‚Äî these two Division I FCS football schools share an intense rivalry in basketball, stemming from Villanova's defeat of John Thompson's Hoya team in the 1985 NCAA championship game. The rivalry takes on a religious tone as Augustinian (Villanova) versus Jesuit (Georgetown). Jokes about the opposing orders fly back and forth during the week preceding Villanova‚ÄìGeorgetown. In recent years the rivalry has undergone somewhat of a revival, with both teams enjoying success in the regular season and recent NCAA tournaments. This rivalry continues in the reconfigured Big East. * Providence Friars and Villanova Wildcats ‚Äî the two smallest schools in the original Big East battle each year. The rivalry is also elevated by the Catholic orders which run the schools; Providence's Dominicans and Villanova's Augustinians. * St. John's Red Storm and Seton Hall Pirates ‚Äì two local \\"Catholic 7\\" schools battle every year in basketball. New York vs New Jersey bragging rights are on the line as well as competing for many local basketball recruits in the area. ;- Non-conference * Notre Dame‚ÄìUConn women's basketball rivalry ‚Äì a rivalry that started in the 1990s when both schools were members of the original Big East, intensified in the 2000‚Äì01 season with three pivotal matchups (one of which became the focal point of a published book), and became nationally significant in the 21st century, especially after UConn's rivalry with Tennessee went on a 13-year hiatus. Notre Dame was responsible for more than half of UConn's losses from 2011 to 2019 (8 out of 15). * Rutgers‚ÄìUConn women's basketball rivalry ‚Äì a rivalry that intensified after Tennessee stopped scheduling Rutgers in non‚Äìconference play. * Stanford‚ÄìUConn women's basketball rivalry ‚Äì another nationally significant rivalry, with five of their 18 total meetings coming in the Final Four. * Tennessee‚ÄìUConn women's basketball rivalry ‚Äì the women's basketball rivalry between the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers and the University of Connecticut Huskies is one of the fiercest rivalries in college basketball, and perhaps the only one to reach national consciousness out of the women's game. This rivalry was halted in 2007 due to a falling-out between the schools' head coaches (respectively Pat Summitt and Geno Auriemma), and did not resume until 2020 (four years after Summitt's death). =Big Ten rivalries= Universities in the Big Ten Conference in the Midwest have more rivalries than Universities in the Southeast.

The two schools, both within the city of Colorado Springs, are not rivals in most sports, since Air Force is a member of NCAA Division I and CC is a member of the non-scholarship Division III. However, CC is one of a small number of Division III schools with special permission from the NCAA to award scholarships in two sports as a Division I member, and therefore competes alongside Air Force on an even footing in those sports. In men's ice hockey, the two schools have a long- standing rivalry known as the Battle for Pikes Peak; in women's soccer, CC is a single-sport member in Air Force's home league, the Mountain West Conference (MW). * University of Alaska Anchorage and University of Alaska Fairbanks ‚Äì (ice hockey) for the Governor's Cup.

Played since 1949. Widely considered to be the most heated and long standing rivalry in college hockey, it is one of the sport's most played rivalries in the United States with over 300 games between the two school (of which nearly 30 games were in the playoffs, and 40 games required overtime). Both schools were charter members of the WCHA in 1951, and became charter members of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference in 2011, which started play in 2013. * Gonzaga University and Eastern Washington University ‚Äì a longtime men's basketball rivalry, but much less competitive since the rise of Gonzaga's program to national prominence in the 21st century.

The winning school could claim bragging rights as best in the state. Has been on hold as neither program is willing to agree to restart the rivalry after Gonzaga's rise to prominence. * Gonzaga University and Washington State University ‚Äì also an emerging men's basketball rivalry. The two schools are about an hour apart by car. * University of Hawai ªi and California State University, Fresno (Fresno State) ‚Äì All sports. Both were members of the WAC from 1992 to 2012, but have now separated, with Hawai ªi leaving for the Big West and Fresno State to the MW. In football, however, it is still a conference rivalry, as Hawai ªi football joined the MW alongside Fresno State. When MW football split into divisions in 2013, Fresno State and Hawai ªi were placed in the same division, ensuring annual matchups for the foreseeable future. * University of Hawaii and Brigham Young University ‚Äì Football and volleyball. BYU has a significant following in Hawaii‚Äîthe school has a branch campus in Hawaii, and the LDS Church also operates a temple near the Hawaii campus. The football version has been off-and-on since the MW broke away from the WAC in 1999, separating the two schools. In men's volleyball, it was long a conference rivalry in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation before Hawaii's primary home of the Big West Conference launched a men's volleyball league in the 2018 season (2017‚Äì18 school year). * University of Idaho and The University of Montana, with the football teams playing for the Little Brown Stein. The rivalry between border-state schools, both current members of the Big Sky Conference in non-football sports, with Montana also a football member of the conference, has its roots in football. The schools first played in football in 1903, and regularly played until Idaho moved to what is now Division I FBS in 1996. The all-sports rivalry lost some of its edge at that time, as Idaho also left the Big Sky, not returning until 2014.

In two sports, football and men's soccer, it is a conference matchup‚ÄîUC Davis is a football member of the Big Sky and Sacramento State is a men's soccer member of the Big West (the Big Sky sponsors women's soccer but not men's). * UC Irvine and California State University, Long Beach (Long Beach State) ‚Äì Black and Blue Rivalry Series: The two Southern California schools compete in various sports such as baseball, basketball and volleyball to accumulate points for every victory. The school with the most points at the end of the year wins a surfboard. * UC Santa Barbara and Cal Poly SLO ‚Äì Blue‚ÄìGreen Rivalry: Battle for the Central Coast with an emphasis on sustainability. The most intense has become the competition in men's soccer, where the matchup has featured 5 of the top 15 attended regular season soccer matches in NCAA history, all of which have happened since 2007. Women's volleyball, men's and women's basketball, and baseball also are heated matchups. * University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) and University of Nevada ‚Äì in the Battle for Nevada (football) for the Fremont Cannon. This became a conference rivalry in 2012 when Nevada joined UNLV in the MW. Both schools were also placed in the same division when the MW expanded to 12 football members. * University of Utah and Utah State University ‚Äì (basketball and football, the Battle of the Brothers) * University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and New Mexico State University ‚Äì The Battle of I-10 * University of Wyoming and Colorado State University ‚Äì (football) the Border War for the Bronze Boot * Western Washington University and Central Washington University ‚Äì (football) Known as the Battle in Seattle ‚Äì played at CenturyLink Field in Seattle for the Cascade Cup. =HBCU rivalries= * Coppin State University and Morgan State University ‚àí separated by 5 miles, this traditional East vs. West Baltimore basketball is a traditional powerhouse HBCU and MEAC Rivalry Tabbed the \\"Battle of Baltimore\\". * Cheyney University and Lincoln University ‚Äì the two oldest black colleges, or HBCUs, in America, both located in Pennsylvania and also two of the few such schools outside the South. The schools compete in everything athletic or academic. Men's and women's teams compete annually in the heated thanksgiving weekend basketball games. The reinstatement of Lincoln's football program will add more fire to the rivalry. * Central State University and Wilberforce University ‚Äì Like Cheyney and Lincoln, these are also rare examples of HBCUs outside the South. This is also a crosstown rivalry, with both schools located in the small community of Wilberforce, Ohio. In addition, Central State began as a department within Wilberforce University before becoming a separate institution and a public school. * North Carolina A&T; State University and North Carolina Central University ‚Äì the \\"Aggie-Eagle Classic\\" was an annual, interdivisional HBCU football until 2005. * North Carolina A&T; State University and Winston-Salem State University ‚Äì the rivalry between the two Piedmont Triad HBCUs briefly escalated with WSSU's transition to Division I athletics and the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference of which NC A&T; is a member, but faded when WSSU backed out of its D-I transition and decided to stay in Division II. * Grambling State University and Southern University ‚Äì the Bayou Classic in football is the most famous HBCU rivalry, and for decades had been the only such matchup televised annually by one of the country's four major over-the-air television networks (NBC has since moved the game from its main network to its cable/satellite NBCSN network). * Bethune‚ÄìCookman University and Florida A&M; University ‚Äì the two MEAC schools compete annually in football in the Florida Classic.

She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 to 2003, and was a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party (NDP) government of Gary Doer from 1999 to 2003. Early life and career Barrett was born in Florida, USA, and moved to Canada in 1975. She has a Master's degree in social work from the University of Manitoba (1979), and was a social worker before entering political life.Mia Rabson, \\"Barrett's decision to exit politics may signal vote near\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 November 2002, A3. Barrett was the Manitoba NDP's director of organization during the 1980s.Ian Stewart, Jim Walding's nomination to constitutional defeat, (Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press, 2009), p. 101. Politician =Opposition member (1990-99)= Barrett was elected in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Wellington in the 1990 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Ernie Gilroy by over 1,200 votes. The Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba won a majority government in this election, and Barrett was appointed as the New Democratic Party's family services critic in opposition.\\"Manitoba sets mass training blitz to fight satanism, abuse of children\\", Toronto Star, 21 September 1990, A4. In June 1991, she criticized Premier Gary Filmon's sudden announcement that Winnipeg's child and family services would be brought under a single agency.\\"Decision denounced\\", Globe and Mail, 25 June 1991, A6. Barrett later criticized the Filmon government for cutting several Manitobans from social assistance programs without making investments in education, job creation programs and skills upgrading.Arlene Billinkoff, \\"Just adding to the misery\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 November 1993. She also brought forward a private member's bill that, if passed, would have required the Manitoba Office of the Children's Advocate to report to the legislature rather than the Minister of Family Services.Arlene Billinkoff, \\"Child advocate kept on a leash\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 May 1993. Barrett also served as her party's justice critic.David Roberts, \\"Senator resigns to become judge\\", Globe and Mail, 11 February 1993, A4; Glen MacKenzie, \\"Criminologist can't get excited' over latest data\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 August 1994. She called on the Filmon government remove provincial judge Bruce McDonald from office in 1993, after McDonald was reported as telling a female complainant to \\"work something out\\" with a man accused of assaulting her.Paul Samyn and Ruth Teichroeb, \\"NDP calls for removal of judge\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 March 1993; Ruth Teichroeb, \\"McCrae vows to hold judge accountable for abuse stand\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 April 1993. McDonald was later forced to resign from the bench after the Winnipeg Free Press uncovered a pattern of questionable behaviour in his decisions.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Defiant judge resigns McDonald cites stress on family\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 December 1993. Barrett also called for Manitoba to ban pellet guns in 1993, when a 14-year-old girl required hospitalization after being shot in the leg.\\"NDP calls for ban on pellet guns\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 June 1993. Barrett led the Manitoba NDP's candidate search committee in the buildup to the 1995 provincial election, and placed an emphasis on recruiting women and minority candidates.Paul Samyn, \\"Election\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 March 1995. She was personally re-elected, defeating her Liberal opponent by almost 2,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won a second majority government provincially, and Barrett was named as her party's urban affairs critic.Paul Samyn, \\"Who's calling the shots?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 September 1995, A3. In May 1998, she unveiled her party's platform for revitalizing the city of Winnipeg. Highlights of the platform included giving more power to city councillors and residents' associations, providing tax incentives for inner city renewal, guaranteeing stable funding for schools, renewing several aboriginal programs and enacting a new anti-gang policy.Doug Nairne, \\"NDP unveils vision for city\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 May 1998, A1. =Minister of Labour and Immigration (1999-2003)= The New Democratic Party won a majority government in the 1999 provincial election. Barrett did not run for re-election in Wellington, but instead challenged popular Liberal incumbent Kevin Lamoureux in the neighbouring division of Inkster. She won by 143 votes. Barrett was regarded as a strong ally of incoming premier Gary Doer,Doug Nairne, \\"Would-be cabinet maker has house full of choices\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 January 1999, A4. and there was little surprise when she was chosen as a member of his first cabinet. Barrett was sworn in as Minister of Labour on October 5, 1999, with responsibility for administering the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act and the Workers Compensation Act, as well as for the Civil Service and Multiculturalism.\\"MANITOBA GOVERNMENT: Doer administration installed in office\\", 6 October 1999. On January 17, 2001, her position was renamed as the Minister of Labour and Immigration, and she was relieved of responsibility for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act and the Civil Service. ;Labour Barrett's primary accomplishment in office was to reform Manitoba's labour laws, reversing many of the decisions made by the right-wing government of Gary Filmon during the 1990s. Her reform legislation, introduced in July 2000, made union certification automatic if 65% of employees sign membership cards, allowed interim certifications, ensured that employees would not be fired for convictions involving minor offenses, and gave employees the exclusive right to approve or reject arbitration if a labour dispute dragged on more than sixty days.David Kuxhaus, \\"Biz leaders call labour law changes 'pretty scary stuff'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 July 2000, A1; Becky Barrett, \\"Labour Act aims for fairness\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 22 July 2000, A15; Becky Barrett, \\"Manitoba labour\\" [editorial], National Post, 4 August 2000, C15; David Kuxhaus, \\"Tories take final swipe at labour law\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 August 2000, A3. The aspects of the bill dealing with arbitration were later modified so as to take into account charges of bad-faith bargaining. See Mia Rabson, \\"Binding arbitration still a sore point\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 January 2003, A6. Barrett argued that the changes were necessary to correct a decade of imbalance under the previous government.David Kuxhaus, \\"Business battles NDP\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 July 2000, A1. The bill was met with intense opposition from the business community and, in response to criticism, Barrett changed the bill to give either party in a labour dispute the right to call for binding arbitration after sixty days.\\"Coalition of 16,000 employers joins fight against Manitoba labour bill\\", Canadian Press, 27 July 2000, 5:45pm; David Kuxhaus, \\"NDP bends on besieged labour bill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 August 2000, A1; Paul McKie, \\"Business, labour dig in at hearings\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 August 2000, A3; Bill Redekop, \\"Labour ups ante in battle over bill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 August 2000, A1. Barrett also allowed parents to take more time off work after the birth of their children,\\"Bill to let parents take more time off work\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 December 2000, A5. and increased Manitoba's minimum wage by 25 cents for every year of her tenure in office.Sean O'Connor, \\"Minimum wage to hit $6.25\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 November 2000, A3; Helen Fallding, \\"Public to weigh worth of $6.25 an hour\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 March 2001, A11; Mia Rabson, \\"Minimum wage should rise to $8, activists say\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 May 2001, A9; \\"Manitoba minimum wage to increase 25 cents to $6.50 on April 1\\", Canadian Press, 28 December 2001, 11:35pm. Following extensive consultations, Barrett subsequently introduced reforms to Manitoba's workplace safety legislation in 2002. These changes gave workplace safety and health inspectors the right to fine employers who ignore safety violations, required employers to ensure their workers receive proper safety training, and required a written health and safety program for all workplaces with more than twenty employees.Mia Rabson, \\"Mothers claim safety fines would've saved their sons\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 April 2002, A6.

The design consists of a 90-degree V8 with an aluminium cylinder block that features a closed upper deck and a deep skirt. The cylinder heads are also aluminium with a DOHC 4 valves design and pentroof combustion chambers. The production blocks and production head castings were used successfully in various forms of racing including the IRL. VH45DE The VH45DE is a V8 developed by Nissan for use in the Infiniti Q45 sport luxury sedan (G50 platform) which was released in November 1989. The engine was also used in the Japanese market Nissan President limousine (JG50 platform) which debuted in late 1990. The VH45DE generates at 6000 rpm and at 4000 rpm with a redline of 6900 rpm. Some of the pertinent features of the VH45DE are forged steel crankshaft, forged steel connecting rods, 6 Bolt main bearing caps with studs, full-length main bearing girdle, lightweight, floating pistons with molybdenum coating, sodium-filled exhaust valves, cross-flow cooling system, hydraulic lash adjusters, single-row silent timing chain, coil-on-plug ignition system, lifter buckets ride directly on cams to reduce friction, redline of 6900 rpm, compression ratio of 10.2:1, bore and stroke of , dimensions: (L) x (W) x (H). The VH45DE featured variable valve timing, also known as VTC, from 1990 until 1995. This was during the time that the \\"Gentleman's Agreement\\" between Japan's automotive manufacturers was in effect, requiring all cars sold in their home market to (on paper, at least) produce no more than . Nissan got around this by publishing the hp rating without VTC, meaning its actual power rating is closer to and . of torque. Due to tightening emissions regulations in the US market, the VTC feature was dropped from the 1996 Infiniti Q45. In the following year, the VH45DE was no longer available in any US market vehicles. The engine continued on in the Japanese market until 2002 in the Nissan President limousine. VH45DEs made before 1994 used plastic timing chain guides, and over time these have been known to fail. This results in a noisy valve-train and parts of the plastic guides can end up in the sump and oil pickup, resulting in engine damage. Nissan changed to metal backed chain guides from 1994 onwards. This engine was used in the following vehicle(s): * 1990-1996 Infiniti Q45, , * 1990-2002 Nissan President, , The VH45DE became a relatively popular engine swap for other platforms due to being low cost to source and also able to be adapted to a Nissan manual transmission when using an aftermarket adapter plate. The VH45DE is also used in a variety of motorsports ranging from drifting to drag racing, boat racing, and dirt track sprint cars (Australia and New Zealand). VH41DE The VH41DE is a V8 that was based on the VH45DE. The bore of remained but the stroke was shortened to . Power output for the new engine was at 5600 rpm and at 4000 rpm. The VH41DE also used a double row timing chain, compared to the VH45DE that used a single row timing chain. Its alternator is also located at the top of the engine which creates an overall narrower engine package which can be handy in engine conversions where it may otherwise foul on the chassis rails.

One of the first national parks to be declared in the country,Nyanga National Park. Undated pamphlet, Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority it contains the highest land in Zimbabwe, with green hills and perennial rivers. Most of its terrain consists of rolling downland, sometimes lightly wooded, lying at altitudes between 1,800-2,593 metres (6,560-7,544 feet). Mount Nyangani, the highest point in Zimbabwe, lies in the centre of the park and Mutarazi Falls, Zimbabwe's highest waterfall, is in the south of the park. Nyanga National park incorporates the former Mutarazi Falls National Park on its southern boundary. History of the park Stormclouds over the Kwaraguza area, acquired by Nyanga National Park in the late 1990s. The national park is one of the oldest in Zimbabwe, established as Rhodes Inyanga National Park, a bequest from Cecil Rhodes. The original park borders extended beyond Udu Dam, along the east bank of the Nyangombe River to the north of the current park boundary. This extension was sold in the 1970s, but the Warrendale section, immediately beyond Udu Dam, had been recovered by the early 1980s. The park nearly doubled in size with the late 1990s purchase of most of the Inyanga Block and Kwaraguza farms. These purchases expanded the national park to the north and east of Mount Nyangani, incorporating some important areas of montane rainforest, the source area of the Kairezi River and Nyama Falls. The incorporation of Nyazengu farm in 2014, previously an enclave within the park, completed the formal protection of Mount Nyangani and the headwaters of the Pungwe River, although Nyazengu had been operated as a private nature reserve until 2000 and as unincorporated council land after the designation and acquisition of Nyazengu farm in 2000. The current name Nyanga reflects the correct vernacular pronunciation of the area. Features =Flora= Nyanga landscape: Afromontane forest and moorland. The vegetation of Nyanga is part of the Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic, within the montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregion. The rainforest is found mainly on the eastern (leeward) slopes, as well as in the steeper valleys on west-facing slopes. It is dominated by Syzygium Woodlands of dwarf msasa have developed on some westward-facing slopes. Copses of Mulanje cypress survive in areas that are safe from fire. Treeferns are a very noticeable part of the Nyanga flora, with the common tree fern occurring on the moorlands and the forest tree fern in the rainforests. The Nyanga aloe, Aloe inyangensis, is found on higher ground. Black wattle, introduced into plantations outside the park spread rapidly into several parts of the park. Pine, planted between Rhodes and Mare Dams, also spread. By 1988 it was estimated that around 40% of the park had been invaded by these alien species. The park authorities maintain a continuous eradication programme. =Fauna= Male waterbuck in the Udu area. A wildlife checklist compiled over several years reveals a remarkable diversity of mammals, including occasional sightings of species such as buffalo and lion that stray into the region from the Mozambique lowlands. Visitors are likely to see kudu, reedbuck, klipspringer and several other antelope; predators, including leopard and hyaena, are also present. The African clawless otter is common in the upper Kairezi River, in the north-east of the park. The park is best known among wildlife conservationists for its populations of blue duiker and Samango monkeys. Neither animal is found outside the Eastern Highlands. The Inyangani river frog is an endangered amphibian found in rocky, fast-flowing streams in the montane grassland. Lake Gulliver and the Mare, Udu, Purdon and Rhodes Dams have been stocked with trout from hatcheries maintained by the Department of National Parks. The rainbow trout is most widespread within the park's dams and streams but brown trout and American brook trout are also present. =Geography and geology= Dolerites of the Nyangani sill, overlying Archaean granite. The park is dominated by Mount Nyangani which lies in the centre and is the highest mountain in Zimbabwe. The park is well watered by numerous streams and rivers. The central and eastern parts of the park form part of the Zambezi Basin. The Nyangombe River, whose tributaries include the Mare River and the Nyamuziwa River, and the Kayirezi River both flow north out of the park, ultimately to join the Mazowe River. The Pungwe River rises at the foot of Nyangani and flows southwards through the park before dropping into the densely wooded Pungwe Gorge. The Mutarazi Falls, a few kilometres south of the Pungwe Gorge, have a drop and are Zimbabwe's highest waterfall; they drop in two stages over granite cliffs into the Honde River valley, which lies outside the park and is a major tea-planting area. Five dams have been constructed for recreation and tourist water supply: Rhodes Dam and Mare Dam on the Mare River, Lake Gulliver and Purdon Dams on tributaries of the Mare River and Udu Dam on a tributary of the Nyangombe River. Most of Nyanga National Park is underlain by granite. The highest mountains are composed of Umkondo Group dolerite and sandstone, with the harder dolerite forming cliffs and ridges and the granite-dolerite contact often forming waterfalls. The Troutbeck dolerite sill, shown in the distance in the photograph of Kwaraguza above, was dated at 1099 Ma. =Archaeological, historical cultural sites= Reconstructed pit structure near Rhodes Dam, Nyanga National Park, probably used as a cattle pen. Fifteenth to seventeenth century ruins of the Ziwa people (upland culture) have been found throughout Nyanga. The ruins include homesteads, centred on pit structures thought to have been used as cattle-pens and larger hill-top settlements, referred to as Forts. The pit structures were once referred to as slave pits, but that interpretation has generally been not supported by archaeologists and is now discredited. There are three sites which can be readily accessed by tourists: Chawomera Fort is located above the Nyangombe River, on a gravel road north of the park headquarters. In addition to the fort, there are several pit structures. Nyangwe Fort, near Mare Dam, is the most extensive and best- preserved ruin in the park. It is a top a small hill with good views over the Mare valley. Near the park headquarters is a reconstructed pit structure - the homestead around a pit structure has been rebuilt and a site museum established. Several other sites have spectacular locations, such as the fort which overlooks the confluence of the Nyangombe and Nyaumziwa rivers and a small fort on top of a hill just west of Mount Nyangani. However these two sites are not easily accessible. Associated with the ruins are extensive agricultural terracing and irrigation furrows. Iron extraction was practised, mainly to support the complex agricultural technology. The core areas of the park were once the private estate of Cecil Rhodes. He acquired it with the aim of growing apples and raising sheep, and spent the last years of his life at his homestead near Rhodes Dam. This homestead is now the Rhodes Museum and Rhodes Nyanga Hotel. Accommodation and camping =Rest camps= There are three large rest camps in Nyanga National Park, all of which consist of fully equipped, self-catering lodges. Rhodes Dam, which is also the park headquarters, is located near the main entrance in a pine forest. Mare Dam is some eight kilometers east of Rhodes, in the center of the park and close to three trout fishing dams and Nyangwe Fort. Udu Dam is in the north-west of the park, on the road to Nyangombe Falls. There are also two lodges at the Pungwe Drift (currently leased to a private operator), one located on each side of the Pungwe River, upstream of the Pungwe Falls. There used to be an isolated chalet at Nyamuziwa Falls, but this was closed in the 1970s. =Camping sites= There is also a camping ground and caravan park on the Mare River half a kilometer west of Rhodes Dam, and a second camping ground at Mutarazi Falls. The larger Nyangombe camping ground, on the main highway from Mutare to Nyanga town was closed in the late 1990s. =Privately owned camps and sites= There are two private facilities within the park: Rhodes Hotel, on the south bank of Rhodes Dam, incorporating Cecil Rhodes' old homestead, and the Mountain Club of Zimbabwe hut, on the Kwaraguza road from Mount Nyangani to Troutbeck. Places of interest =Central and western area= This is the most developed part of the park, stretching from the park headquarters at Rhodes Dam to Mount Nyangani. The area includes the three rest camps and the five dams. Places of interest which are accessible on dust roads maintained by the park are Nyangombe Falls, Nyamuziwa Falls, Mount Nyangani and the two largest archaeological sites: Nyangwe Fort and Chawomera Fort. This area also includes the main recreational facilities, such as the five dams stocked for fly-fishing and the pony trails office. Pungwe and Nyazengu gorges in the south of the park. =Southern area= Administered from the Pungwe Drift substation, this region is less developed, with roads only along the edges. Access from the park headquarters is via the \\"Scenic road\\", a gravel road that runs parallel to the Nyanga to Mutare highway. The Pungwe Drift substation and lodges are at the end of a steep dust road, off the Secenic Road. The Pungwe View, from which the Pungwe Falls and Pungwe Gorge can be seen, is on the edge of the Scenic Road. Further south is Mutarazi Falls - the highest waterfall in Zimbabwe, which can also be accessed by most vehicles. Access to the beautiful Thomberutedza Falls requires four wheel drive and the dense Pungwe gorge rainforest can only be accessed on foot. There is a four-wheel drive track that links the Pungwe Drift to Mount Nyangani, through the Nyazengu area. =Eastern area= The rarely visited Nyama Falls on the north-eastern side of Mount Nyangani. The land east of Mount Nyangani was added to the park in the late 1990s and is administered from the Donjera (Gleneagles) Substation on the former Inyanga Block Estate. The area comprises the eastern slopes of Mount Nyangani, Little Nyangani and Mataka Mountains and the Kayirezi and Nyama valleys. Much of the lower-lying ground is forested with pine and blue gum. Access by road is from Mount Nyangani along the Gleneagles road or from Troutbeck via Nyafaru. This requires special permission from park headquarters, as the roads are gated. Tourism =Access= There are tarred roads from Mutare and Rusape to Nyanga village. The main road to Nyanga town passes through the park shortly after Juliasdale. =Game viewing= Although there are no game viewing hides and Nyanga is not primarily a game park, there is a variety of wildlife to be seen, especially in the central and western parts of the park. =Hiking= Mount Nyangani from the west. The main hiking route, the \\"Tourist Path\\", goes from the building on the far right and ascends to the left of the summit plateau on the skyline. There are numerous hiking paths leading to most of the waterfalls and many of the ruins, and along the rivers and mountains in the park. The scenic beauty of many of the roads and tracks also makes these attractive for hiking. The main route up Mount Nyangani is an exhilarating hike, and has views across the park, much of Nyanga District and further into Mozambique. =Horse riding= Short horse- riding trails are available around Nyangwe Fort, the Experimental Fruit Station and Mare Dam, as well as longer trails into Warrendale, beyond Udu Dam. The trails start and end at the Pony Trails office, on the gravel road from the park headquarters to Mare Dam. =Fly fishing= Nyazengu Trout Hatchery. The dams and rivers of Nyanga National Park are stocked with trout. The five dams and the Kayirezi, Mare, Nyamuziwa, Nyangombe and Pungwe Rivers are stocked with rainbow trout. Brown trout and brook trout are to be found in Lake Gulliver and Purdon Dam only. The park entrance fee includes a fishing license, valid for all waters open to fishing, except for Lake Gulliver and Purdon Dam, for which a separate license is available. Fishing is restricted to certain times of year. =Swimming= River in the park are free of bilharzia, unlike the rest of Zimbabwe. There is a natural swimming pool on the Nyangombe River, near the park headquarters, and a swimming weir on the Udu River below Udu Dam. =Boating= The park's five dams are all suitable for boating and boats are available for hire at Rhodes, Mare and Udu Dams.

Apart from the candidate, they are often a campaign's most visible leader. However, modern campaign managers, particularly at the presidential level, are mostly concerned with executing strategy, not setting it. The senior strategists are typically outside political consultants, primarily pollsters and media consultants. Particularly for large, well-funded campaigns, campaign managers often manage a huge number of staffers and volunteers in a variety of departments, while also coordinating closely with the candidate and outside consultants. In the United States, increasingly, campaign management has been a speciality occupation. The top-tier of managers will move throughout the country working on a different campaign each election cycle. The challenges of building a successful operation from scratch in less than 2 years makes experienced professionals increasingly valuable. In addition to their past experience, experienced campaign managers also bring with them knowledge of campaign management tools and relationships with political consultants.

Pollution disproportionately affects communities of color. Environmental racism is a concept in the environmental justice movement, which developed in the United States throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The term is used to describe environmental injustice that occurs within a racialized context both in practice and policy. In the United States, environmental racism criticizes inequalities between urban and exurban areas after white flight. Internationally, environmental racism can refer to the effects of the global waste trade, like the negative health impact of the export of electronic waste to China from developed countries.  Definition  \\"Environmental Racism\\" was coined in 1982 by Benjamin Chavis, previous executive director of the United Church of Christ (UCC) Commission for Racial Justice. Chavis's speech addressed hazardous polychlorinated biphenyl waste in the Warren County PCB Landfill, North Carolina. Chavis defined the term as: > racial discrimination in environmental policy making, the enforcement of > regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of color for > toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening > presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities, and the history of > excluding people of color from leadership of the ecology movements. The UCC and US General Accounting Office reports on this case in North Carolina associated locations of hazardous waste sites with poor minority neighborhoods. Chavis and Dr. Robert D. Bullard pointed out institutionalized racism stemming from government and corporate policies that led to environmental racism. Practices included redlining, zoning, and colorblind adaptation planning. Residents experienced environmental racism due to their low socioeconomic status, and lack of political representation and mobility. Expanding the definition in \\"The Legacy of American Apartheid and Environmental Racism,\\" Dr. Bullard said that environmental racism > refers to any policy, practice, or directive that differentially affects or > disadvantages (whether intended or unintended) individuals, groups, or > communities based on race or color. Environmental justice combats barriers preventing equal access to work, recreation, education, religion, and safe neighborhoods. Greenaction.org explains that, ‚Äúenvironmental justice refers to those cultural norms and values, rules, regulations, behaviors, policies, and decisions to support sustainability, where all people can hold with confidence that their community and natural environment is safe and productive.‚Äù Environmental racism is a specific form of environmental injustice with which the underlying cause of said injustice is believed to be race-based.  Background  Environmental racism can be traced back around 500 years with the arrival of the Europeans and their displacement of Native Americans. The Environmental Justice Movement, however, was rooted around the same time as the Civil Rights Movement. The Civil Rights Movement influenced the mobilization of people by echoing the empowerment and concern associated with political action. Here, the civil rights agenda and the environmental agenda met. However, environmental organizations such as Sierra Club distanced themselves from cases such as the Warren County case likely because of their unwillingness to risk technical support when dealing with a very social issue. The acknowledgement of environmental racism prompted the environmental justice social movement that began in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States. While environmental racism has been historically tied to the environmental justice movement, throughout the years the term has been increasingly disassociated. In response to cases of environmental racism, grassroots organizations and campaigns have brought more attention to environmental racism in policy making and emphasize the importance of having input from minorities in policymaking. Although the term was coined in the US, environmental racism also occurs on the international level. Examples include the exportation of hazardous wastes to poor countries in the Global South with lax environmental policies and safety practices (pollution havens). Marginalized communities that do not have the socioeconomic and political means to oppose large corporations are at risk to environmentally racist practices that are detrimental and sometimes fatal to humans. Economic statuses and political positions are crucial factors when looking at environmental problems because they determine where a person lives. = Causes = There are four factors which lead to environmental racism: lack of affordable land, lack of political power, lack of mobility, and poverty. Cheap land is sought by corporations and governmental bodies. As a result, communities which cannot effectively resist these corporations and governmental bodies and cannot access political power cannot negotiate just costs. Communities with minimized socio-economic mobility cannot relocate. Lack of financial contributions also reduces the communities' ability to act both physically and politically. Chavis defined environmental racism in five categories: racial discrimination in defining environmental policies, discriminatory enforcement of regulations and laws, deliberate targeting of minority communities as hazardous waste dumping sites, official sanctioning of dangerous pollutants in minority communities, and the exclusion of people of color from environmental leadership positions. Minority communities often do not have the financial means, resources, and political representation to oppose hazardous waste sites. Known as locally unwanted land uses or LULU's, these facilities that benefit the whole community often reduce the quality of life of minority communities. These neighborhoods also may depend on the economic opportunities the site brings and are reluctant to oppose its location at the risk of their health. Additionally, controversial projects are less likely to be sited in non-minority areas that are expected to pursue collective action and succeed in opposing the siting the projects in their area. Processes such as suburbanization, gentrification, and decentralization lead to patterns of environmental racism. For example, the process of suburbanization (or white flight) consists of non-minorities leaving industrial zones for safer, cleaner, and less expensive suburban locales. Meanwhile, minority communities are left in the inner cities and in close proximity to polluted industrial zones. In these areas, unemployment is high and businesses are less likely to invest in area improvement, creating poor economic conditions for residents and reinforcing a social formation that reproduces racial inequality. Furthermore, the poverty of property owners and residents in a municipality may be taken into consideration by hazardous waste facility developers since areas with depressed real estate values will cut expenses. Environmental racism has many factors that contribute towards it's discrimination. Green Action references the \\"cultural norms and values, rules, regulations, behaviors, policies, and decisions\\" that support the concept of sustainability and wherein environmental racism lies.  Socioeconomic aspects of environmental racism  = Cost benefit analysis = Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a process that places a monetary value on costs and benefits to evaluate issues.\\"Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)\\", World Bank Group. n.d. Accessed: November 20, 2011. Environmental CBA aims to provide policy solutions for intangible products such as clean air and water by measuring a consumer's willingness to pay for these goods. CBA contributes to environmental racism through the valuing of environmental resources based on their utility to society. When someone is willing and able to pay more for clean water or air, their society financially benefits society more than when people cannot pay for these goods. This creates a burden on poor communities. Relocating toxic wastes is justified since poor communities are not able to pay as much as a wealthier area for a clean environment. The placement of toxic waste near poor people lowers the property value of already cheap land. Since the decrease in property value is less than that of a cleaner and wealthier area, the monetary benefits to society are greater by dumping the toxic waste in a \\"low-value\\" area.Westra, Laura, and Bill E. Lawson. Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2001. = Devaluation cycle = Research conducted by Professor Been indicates that there are other factors acting on environmental racism.\\"Chapter 3 Tackling gender and socio-economic inequities in reading\\". dx.doi.org. Retrieved 2019-03-14. Professor Been's research examined the change in the socioeconomic composition of a surrounding community in Houston after ten noxious facilities were constructed. She found that initially five of the ten facilities were located in areas with above average percentages of non-white residents, while the other five locals had lower percentages of non- white residents. Over time there was a significant shift in demographics. By 1990, nine out of the ten facilities had above average percentages of minority residents; Been then concluded that these results pointed to a case of \\"white flight\\". A study conducted by the University of Massachusetts found that when compared to their counterparts, home values fall by $11,000 when they are located by commercial hazardous waste facilities.Hagiioannu, Andrew (2003), \\"By Equal War Made One: The Scramble for Social Order in The Five Nations\\", The Man who would be Kipling, Palgrave Macmillan UK, pp. 117‚Äì135, , retrieved 2019-03-14  Impacts on health  Environmental racism impacts the health of the communities affected by poor environments. Various factors that can cause health problems include exposure to hazardous chemical toxins in landfills and rivers. In Defense of Animals claims intensive agriculture affects the health of the communities they are near through pollution and environmental injustice. They claim such areas have waste lagoons that produce hydrogen sulfide, higher levels of miscarriages, birth defects, and disease outbreaks from viral and bacterial contamination of drinking water. These farms are disproportionately placed and largely affect low-income areas and communities of color. Because of the socioeconomic status and location of many of these areas, the people affected cannot easily escape these conditions. This includes exposure to pesticides in agriculture and poorly-managed toxic waste dumping to nearby homes and communities from factories disposing of toxic animal waste. Intensive agriculture also poses a hazard to its workers through high demand velocities, low pay, poor cleanliness in facilities, and other health risks. The workers employed in intensive agriculture are largely composed of minority races, and these facilities are often near minority communities. Areas that are near factories of this sort are also subjected to contaminated drinking water, toxic fumes, chemical run-off, pollutant particulate matter in the air, and other various harmful risks leading to lessened quality of life and potential disease outbreak. Minority populations are exposed to greater environmental health risks than white people, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As stated by Greenlining, an advocacy organization based out of Oakland, CA, ‚Äú[t]he EPA‚Äôs National Center for Environmental Assessment found that when it comes to air pollutants that contribute to issues like heart and lung disease, Blacks are exposed to 1.5 times more of the pollutant than whites, while Hispanics were exposed to about 1.2 times the amount of non-Hispanic whites. People in poverty had 1.3 times the exposure of those not in poverty.‚Äù  Climate change  As the climate has changed progressively over the past several decades, there has been a collision between environmental racism and global climate change. The overlap of these two phenomena, many argue, has disproportionately affected different communities and populations throughout the world due to disparities in socio- economic status. This is especially true in the Global South where, for example, byproducts of global climate change such as increasingly frequent and severe landslides resulting from more heavy rainfall events in Quito, Ecuador force people to also deal with profound socio-economic ramifications like the destruction of their homes or even death. Countries such as Ecuador often contribute relatively little to climate change in terms of metrics like carbon dioxide emissions but have far fewer resources to ward off the negative localized impacts of climate change. The argument is that places like these are made much more vulnerable than the main contributing countries, but not by their own doing. Some also claim a general attitude of apathy on the part of developed nations and the largest climate change contributors towards the disproportionate effects of their actions on those that contribute relatively much less. While people living in the Global South have typically been impacted most by the effects of climate change, people of color in the Global North also face similar situations in several areas. The southeastern part of the United States has experienced a large amount of pollution and minority populations have been hit with the brunt of those impacts. One example of this inequality is in so-called \\"Cancer Alley,\\" an 85-mile area in Louisiana known for its exacerbated cancer rates. Other examples include sugar industry pollution in Pahokee, Florida, paper mills in Africatown, Alabama, PCBs dumped by Burlington Industries in Cheraw, South Carolina, and toxic coal ash in Uniontown, Alabama. Superfund sites, or areas of polluted land that require long-term response to remove hazardous waste contamination, are largely located near low-income housing. An estimated 2 million people, mostly communities of low-income and people of color, live near the Superfund sites most vulnerable to climate change. The issues of climate change and communities that are in a danger zone are not limited to North America or the United States either. There are several communities around the world that face the same concern of industry and people who are dealing with its negative impacts in their areas. For example, the work of Desmond D‚ÄôSa focused on communities in south Durban where high pollution industries impact people forcibly relocated during the Apartheid. Environmental racism and climate change coincide with one another. Rising seas affect poor areas such as Kivalina, Alaska, and Thibodaux, Louisiana, and countless other places around the globe. There are many cases of people who have died or are chronically ill from coal plants in Detroit, Memphis, and Kansas City, as well as numerous other areas. Tennessee and West Virginia residents are frequently subject to breathing toxic ash due to blasting in the mountains for mining. Drought, flooding, the constant depletion of land and air quality determine the health and safety of the residents surrounding these areas. Communities of color and low-income status most often feel the brunt of these issues firsthand.  Cases of environmental racism by location  = North America =  United States of America  In the United States, the first report to draw a relationship between race, income, and risk of exposure to pollutants was the Council of Environmental Quality's \\"Annual Report to the President\\" in 1971, in response to toxic waste dumping in an African American community in Warren County, NC.United States of America. Environmental Justice Group. National Conference of State Legislatures. Environmental Justice: A Matter of Perspective. 1995 After protests in Warren County, North Carolina, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report on the case in 1983, and the United Church of Christ (UCC) commissioned a report exploring the concept in 1987 drawing a connection between race and the placement of the hazardous waste facilities.Chavis, Jr., Benjamin F., and Charles Lee, \\"Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States,\\" United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, 1987Office, U.S. Government Accountability (1983-06-14). \\"Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation With Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities\\" (RCED-83‚Äì168). The outcry in Warren County was an important event in spurring minority, grassroots involvement in the environmental justice movement by addressing cases of environmental racism. The US Government Accountability Office study in response to the 1982 protests against the PCB landfill in Warren County was among the first groundbreaking studies that drew correlations between the racial and economic background of communities and the location of hazardous waste facilities. However, the study was limited in scope by only focusing on off-site hazardous waste landfills in the Southeastern United States.Colquette and Robertson, 159. In response to this limitation the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice (CRJ) directed a comprehensive national study on demographic patterns associated with the location of hazardous waste sites. The CRJ national study conducted two examinations of areas surrounding commercial hazardous waste facilities and the location of uncontrolled toxic waste sites. The first study examined the association between race and socio-economic status and the location of commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. After statistical analysis, the first study concluded that \\"the percentage of community residents that belonged to a racial or ethnic group was a stronger predictor of the level of commercial hazardous waste activity than was household income, the value of the homes, the number of uncontrolled waste sites, or the estimated amount of hazardous wastes generated by industry\\".Colquette and Robertson, 159-160. The second study examined the presence of uncontrolled toxic waste sites in ethnic and racial minority communities, and found that 3 out of every 5 African and Hispanic Americans lived in communities with uncontrolled waste sites.Colquette and Robertson, 159-161. Other studies found race to be the most influential variable in predicting where waste facilities were located. From the reports on environmental racism in Warren County, NC, the accumulation of studies and reports on cases of environmental racism and injustices garnered increased public attention in the US. Eventually this led to President Bill Clinton's 1994 Executive Order 12898 which directed agencies to develop a strategy that manages environmental justice, but not every federal agency has fulfilled this order to date.\\"Presidential Documents\\" (PDF). Federal Register. 1994 ‚Äì via National Archives. This was a historical step in addressing environmental injustice on a policy level, especially within a predominantly white-dominated environmentalism movement; however, the effectiveness of the Order is noted mainly in its influence on states as Congress never passed a bill making Clinton's Executive Order law.\\"Environmentalism's Racist History\\". The New Yorker. Retrieved 2018-10-19. The issuance of the Order propelled states into action as many states began to require relevant agencies to develop strategies and programs that would identify and address environmental injustices being perpetrated at the state or local level. In 2005, during George W. Bush's administration, there was an attempt to remove the premise of racism from the Order. EPA's Administrator Stephen Johnson wanted to redefine the Order's purpose to shift from protecting low income and minority communities that may be disadvantaged by government policies to all people. President Barack Obama's appointment of Lisa Jackson as EPA Administrator and the issuance of Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Justice and Executive Order 12898 established a recommitment to environmental justice.\\"National Archives and Records Administration, Website\\". The SHAFR Guide Online. Retrieved 2019-03-14. The fight against environmental racism faced some setbacks with the election of President Trump. Under Trump's administration, there was a mandated decrease of EPA funding accompanied by a rollback on regulations which has left many underrepresented communities vulnerable. As a result of the placement of hazardous waste facilities, minority populations experience greater exposure to harmful chemicals and suffer from health outcomes that affect their ability at work and in schools. A comprehensive study of particulate emissions across the United States, published in 2018, found that Blacks were exposed to 54% more particulate matter emissions (soot) than the average American. Faber and Krieg found a correlation between higher air pollution exposure and low performance in schools and found that 92% of children at five Los Angeles public schools with the poorest air quality were of a minority background. School systems for communities heavily populated with minority families tend to provide \\"unequal educational opportunities\\" in comparison to school systems in predominantly white neighborhoods.Turner, Rita. \\"The Slow Poisoning of Black Bodies: A Lesson in Environmental Racism and Hidden Violence.\\" Meridians: feminism, race, transnationalism, vol. 15, no. 1, 2016, p. 189+. Literature Resource Center, http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE|A486754206. Accessed 27 November 2018. Pollution consequently presents itself in these communities due to societal factors such as \\"underfunded schools, income inequality, and myriad egregious denials of institutional support\\" within the African American community.Turner, 2016. In a study supporting the term of environmental racism, it was shown in the American Mid-Atlantic and American North-East that African Americans were exposed to 61% of particulate matter, while Latinos were exposed to 75%, and Asians were exposed to 73%. Overall, these populations experience 66% more pollution exposure from particulate matter than the white population. When environmental racism became acknowledged in the US society, it stimulated the environmental justice social movement that gained wave throughout the 1970s and 1980s in the US. Historically, the term environmental racism is tied to environmental justice movement. However, this has changed with time to the extent it is believed to lack any associations with the movement. Grassroots organizations and campaigns have sprung up in response to this environmental racism with these groups mainly demanding the inclusion of minorities when it comes to policy making involving the environment. It is also worth noting that this concept is international despite being coined in the US. A perfect example is when the United States exported its hazardous wastes to the poor nations in the Global South because they knew that these countries had lax environmental regulations and safety practices. Marginalized communities are usually at risk of environmental racism because they resource and means to oppose the large companies that dump these dangerous wastes. Overall, the US has worked to reduce environmental racism with municipality changes. These policies help develop further change. Some cities and counties have taken advantage of environmental justice policies and applied it to the public health sector. = Native American reservations = The 260x260px The Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the Trail of Tears may be considered early examples of environmental racism in the United States. As a result of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, by 1850, all tribes east of the Mississippi had been removed to western lands, essentially confining them to \\"lands that were too dry, remote, or barren to attract the attention of settlers and corporations.\\" During World War II, military facilities were often located conterminous to reservations, leading to a situation in which \\"a disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands.\\" A study analyzing the approximately 3,100 counties in the continental United States found that Native American lands are positively associated with the count of sites with unexploded ordnance deemed extremely dangerous. The study also found that the risk assessment code (RAC) used to measure dangerousness of sites with unexploded ordnance can sometimes conceal how much of a threat these sites are to Native Americans. The hazard probability, or probability that a hazard will harm people or ecosystems, is sensitive to the proximity of public buildings such as schools and hospitals. These parameters neglect elements of tribal life such as subsistence consumption, ceremonial use of plants and animals, and low population densities. Because these tribal-unique factors are not considered, Native American lands can often receive low-risk scores, despite threat to their way of life. The hazard probability does not take Native Americans into account when considering the people or ecosystems that could be harmed. Locating military facilities coterminous to reservations lead to a situation in which ‚Äúa disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands.‚Äù More recently, Native American lands have been used for waste disposal and illegal dumping by the US and multinational corporations.Goldtooth, Tom. \\"Indigenous Nations: Summary of Sovereignty and Its Implications for Environmental Protection.\\" Environmental justice issues, policies, and solutions.

This included allegations that the US \\"deliberately and systematically permitted, aided, and abetted, solicited and conspired to commit the dumping, transportation, and location of nuclear, toxic, medical, and otherwise hazardous waste materials on Native American territories in North America and has thus created a clear and present danger to the health, safety, and physical and mental well-being of Native American People.\\" An ongoing issue for Native Americans activists is the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline was proposed to start in North Dakota and travel to Illinois. Although it does not cross directly on a reservation, the pipeline is under scrutiny because it passes under a section of the Missouri river which is the main drinking water source for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Pipelines are known to break, with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) reporting more than 3,300 leak and rupture incidents for oil and gas pipelines since 2010. The pipeline also traverses a sacred burial ground for the Standing Rock Sioux. The Tribal Historic Preservation Officer of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe voiced concerns related to sacred sites and archaeological materials. These concerns were ignored. President Barack Obama revoked the permit for the project in December 2016 and ordered a study on rerouting the pipeline. President Donald Trump reversed this order and authorized the completion of the pipeline. In 2017, Judge James Boasberg sided with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, citing the US Army Corps of Engineers failure to complete a study on the environmental impact of an oil spill in Lake Oahe when it first approved construction. A new environmental study was ordered and released in October 2018, but the pipeline remained operational. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe rejected the study, believing it fails to address many of their concerns. There are still ongoing litigation efforts by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline in an effort to shut it down permanently. =Illinois= Environmental racism is especially prominent in large cities as well. The city of Chicago, Illinois, has had difficulties around industry and its impacts on minority populations, especially the African American community. For example, the Crawford and Fisk coal plants have been implicated in the poor health of their local communities, a correlation exacerbated by the fact that 34% of adults in those communities do not have health care coverage. One community directly affected by a toxic environment due to racial discrimination is Altgeld Gardens, a 6,000 unit public housing community located in south Chicago that was built in 1945 on an abandoned landfill to accommodate returning African American World War II veterans. Surrounded by 53 toxic facilities and 90% of the city's landfills, the Altgeld Gardens area became known as a \\"toxic doughnut.\\" In Altgeld Gardens, 90% of its population are African-American and 65% live below the poverty level.People for Community Recovery (PCR), Altgeld Gardens Retrieved March 23, 2010. The known toxins and pollutants affecting the Altgeld Gardens area include mercury, ammonia gas, lead, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, and xylene. In 1984, a study by Illinois Public Health Sector revealed excessive rates of prostate, bladder, and lung cancer. Additionally, as reported in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's seminar on social and environment interface, medical records have indicated high rates of children born with brain tumors, high rates of fetuses that had to be aborted after tests revealed that the brains were developing outside the skull, and higher rates of asthma, ringworm, and other ailments. Despite evidence of health problems caused by environmental factors, the residents of Altgeld Gardens have not been relocated to another public housing project. In Chicago's predominantly Latino neighborhoods such as Little Village, the array coal plants were contributors to respiratory diseases and other health complications during the early twenty-first century. In addition to air pollution, Little Village lacked safe outdoor recreational areas while housing a County Jail that occupied 96 acres.Kern, et al. 2018, p. 954. Despite widespread displeasure among community members, activists were afraid to speak out because their neighborhood could be gentrified. Many Latino neighborhoods are populated by working class citizens vulnerable to the increased cost of living caused by gentrification.Kern, et al. 2018, p. 953. Some advocates still fought for environmental improvements regardless of their fear, and when their requests began to come to fruition, like the eventual increase in local green spaces, many residents were left feeling out of place in their homes, which could be attributed to shifts in factors like local police presences, local racial diversity, and overall class of the townsfolk.Kern, et al. 2018, p. 960. = California = The city of Los Angeles, California is facing concerns much like several other areas in the United States. As in many cases, poor areas and underdeveloped communities that are most prone to pollution and the impacts of climate change also happen to be the areas where minority populations are the highest. In the case of Los Angeles, the most prevalent minority population at risk is the Hispanic community. This community has shown significant concern about climate change because they are the most likely to live in impacted areas. The City Project aims to examine burden populations and how to provide aid or better planning and development. The environmental injustices in Los Angeles became known roughly thirty or forty years ago and minority communities remain at risk today from city planning that happened just a few decades ago. The Civil Rights Act (CRA) was used in the 1994 lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority which failed to provide services for poor LA County residents. In response to fatal diesel pollution in the air around ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach in 2006, the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, or CAAP, was passed. The action plan was created to reduce pollution caused by ports; specifically, it demanded a 45% decrease in pollution once the proposal was put into action.De Lara 2017, p. 540. Another layer of the plan's objective was to reduce negative environmental impacts from trucks with the initial plans for the Clean Truck Program (CTP), which intended to cut back on the use of shipping trucks from the docks and instead called for purer options like rail yards and warehouses that could hopefully improve the air quality. = Louisiana = Diamond, a small African American community, filed a lawsuit against Shell gas company after years of experiencing toxic emissions from the neighboring refinery. Shell offered to buy out the homes that the residents owned, however, the property value was so low that residents could not get new housing. Eventually after protesting and making the issue a public matter, Shell eventually agreed to relocate the residents. In 1989, the Louisiana Energy Services (LES), a British, German and American conglomerate, conducted a nationwide search to find the \\"best\\" site to build a privately owned uranium enrichment plant. The LES claimed to use an objective scientific method to select Louisiana as the \\"best\\" place to build the plant. In response to the selection, the communities of Homer, Forest Grove and Center Springs that are nearby the proposed site formed a group called Citizens Against Nuclear Trash (CANT). With the help of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund (later changed to Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund), CANT sued LES for practicing environmental racism. Finally after 8 years, on May 1, 1997, a three-judge panel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board found that racial bias did play a role in the selection process. In response to the victory, the London Times declared, \\"Louisiana Blacks Win Nuclear War.\\" The courts decision was also upheld on appeal on April 4, 1998.People on the roofs of their houses avoiding the flood after Hurricane Katrina. At the time of Hurricane Katrina, 60.5% of New Orleans residents were African American. Pre- existing racial disparities in wealth within New Orleans worsened the outcome of Hurricane Katrina for minority populations. Institutionalized racial segregation of neighborhoods meant minority members were more likely to live in low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding. Additionally, hurricane evacuation plans relied heavily on the use of cars and did not prepare for people who relied on public transportation. Because minority populations are less likely to own cars, some people had no choice but to stay behind, while white majority communities escaped. A report commissioned by the U.S. House of Representatives found that political leaders failed to consider the fact that \\"100,000 city residents had no cars and relied on public transit\\" and the city's failure to complete its mandatory evacuation led to hundreds of deaths. In the months following the disaster, political, religious, and civil rights groups, celebrities, and New Orleans residents spoke out against what they believed was racism on the part of the United States government. After the hurricane, in a meeting held between the Congressional Black Caucus, the National Urban League, the Black Leadership Forum, the National Council of Negro Women, and the NAACP, Black leaders criticized the response of the federal government calling it \\"slow and incomplete\\" and discussed the role of race in this response. With rising sea levels, lack of mobility of non-white populations in coastal cities like New Orleans foreshadow future unequal impacts of climate change and natural disasters on minority communities.2017 Climate March protester holds up sign on the Flint water crisis =Michigan= Since April 2014, residents of Flint, Michigan, a city that is almost 57% Black and notably impoverished, have been drinking and bathing in water that contains enough lead to meet the Environmental Protection Agency's definition of \\"toxic waste.\\" Before 2014 when the city of Flint switched to their own river as means of water, Lake Huron provided the area with water. Researchers at Virginia Tech discovered in 2015 that the Flint River is 19 times more corrosive than Lake Huron. Lead contamination can engender multiple health conditions. A November 2015 class-action lawsuit describes how Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) failed to treat the new water source with an anti-corrosive agent, thereby causing the water to become increasingly discolored. This was in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule and MDEQ did not correctly complete the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated lead assessments. Adding that agent (orthophosphate) would have cost $100 per day, according to CNN, and 90 percent of the problems with Flint's water would have been averted if it had been used. Apart from lead leached from plumbing fixtures, other sources of lead contamination include dust from lead-based paints and use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline, both of which have been phased out in many countries. After an official investigation was conducted, Michigan's attorney general Bill Schuette initially filed charges against three government officials: two state officials of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Michael Prysby and Stephen Busch, and a Flint city employee, Michael Glasglow, who was the city's water quality supervisor. They were brought up against felony charges such as \\"misconduct, neglect of duty, and conspiracy to tamper with evidence.\\" They were also charged with violating the Michigan Safe Water Drinking Act. All the charges were dropped against these defendants, and all the others investigated or charged, except for those against Corinne Miller, who had worked in the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. On September 14, 2016, Miller pleaded no contest to the neglect of duty charge and agreed to testify against the other defendants.Former state epidemiologist takes plea deal in Flint water crisis prosecution The Flint Journal via MLive.com, September 14, 2016 She was later sentenced to a year probation, 300 hours of community service, and fined $1,200.Former state health worker sentenced to probation in Flint water crisis WJRT-TV (ABC 12), March 13, 2017 On April 16, 2020, an article was published giving details of evidence of corruption and a coverup by former Governor Rick Snyder and his ‚Äúfixer‚Äù Rich Baird, and stating that the statute of limitations on some of the most serious felony misconduct-in- office charges would expire on April 25, 2020. The article was published by Vice News, written by Jordan Chariton and Jenn Dize, the co-founders of Status Coup, with photos by Brittany Greeson. Responses from Michigan state authorities denied that a deadline was approaching, and said that criminal prosecutions would follow. = North Carolina = Racism and environmental justice unified for the first time during the 1983 citizen opposition to a proposed PCB landfill in Warren County, North Carolina. North Carolina state officials decided to bury soil contaminated with toxic polychlorinated biphenyls in Afton, a small town in Warren County, despite such an action being illegal.Colquette and Robertson, 157. As a result, between June 1978 and August 1978, 30,000 gallons (114 m¬≥) of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)-contaminated waste were deposited along 210 miles of North Carolina roads. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared the PCBs a threat to public health and required the state to remove the polluted waste. In 1979, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and EPA Region 4 selected Warren County as the site to deposit the PCB- contaminated soil that was collected from the roadsides. Warren County is one of the six counties along the \\"black belt\\" of North Carolina. The counties residing in the \\"black belt\\" are significantly poorer than the rest of the state. In the early 1980s the residents in Warren County earned an average per capita income of $6,984 compared to $9,283 for the rest of the state. In 1980, the population of Warren County was 54.5% African-American. In 1982, the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed a lawsuit in the district courts to block the landfill. The residents lost the case in court. In September 1982, the outraged citizens of Warren County joined by civil rights groups, environmental leaders, and clergymen protested the first truckloads of PCB-contaminated soil. During the protest, over 500 people were arrested and jailed. Despite protests and scientific evidence that the plan would cause drinking water contamination, the Warren County PCB Landfill was built and the toxic waste was placed in the landfill. After nearly two decades of suspected leaks, state and federal sources paid a contractor $18 million to detoxify the PCB contaminated soil in Warren County. Warren County is often cited as the first environmental justice case in the United States; however, this movement started years earlier in 1978 with the discovery of toxic waste in Love Canal, New York. North Carolina is home to 31 coal ash pits that store an expected 111 million tons of harmful waste created by coal-fired power plants. It is also home to many excrement pits, referred to indirectly as \\"lagoons,\\" that store roughly 10 billion pounds of wet waste created every year by swine, poultry, and dairy cattle in the state. Many of North Carolina's hog farms are grouped along the coastal plain, with a high percentage of African-American residents. The coastal city of Wilmington has been repeatedly threatened by hurricanes, and its environmental risks are increased by its proximity to hog farms, Brunswick Nuclear Generating Station, and coal-ash pits‚Äîone of which has already spilled over, due to Hurricane Florence in September 2018. Hog waste spills can be destructive to the individuals who live close to these pits and farms and a significant number of the neighbors are low-income ethnic minorities. In 1971, racial strains over the absence of protection for African Americans resulted in the arrest of several black activists who came to be known as the \\"Wilmington Ten.\\" One of those activists, Benjamin Chavis, would later turn into a significant figure in the environmental justice movement. Two epidemiologists at the University of North Carolina at Sanctuary Slope distributed a paper in 2014 titled: \\"Industrial Hog Operations in North Carolina Excessively Effect African- Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans.\\" =Pennsylvania= Chester, Pennsylvania, provides an example of \\"social, political, and economic forces that shape the disproportionate distribution of environmental hazards in poor communities of color.\\" Cole, Luke and Foster, Sheila. 2001.

Chester is located in Delaware County, an area with a population of 500,000 that, excluding Chester, is 91% White. Chester, however, is 65% African American, with the highest minority population and poverty rate in Delaware County, and recipient of a disproportionate amount of environmental risks and hazards. Chester has five large waste facilities including a trash incinerator, a medical waste incinerator, and a sewage treatment plant. These waste sites in Chester have a total permitted capacity of 2 million tons of waste per year while the rest of Delaware County has a capacity of merely 1,400 tons per year. One of the waste sites located in Chester is the Westinghouse incinerator, which burns all of the municipal waste from the entire county and surrounding states. These numerous waste facilities engender very significant health risks to the citizens of Chester, as the cancer rate in this area is 2.5 times higher than it is anywhere else in Pennsylvania. The mortality rate is 40% higher than the rest of Delaware County. = Texas = San Antonio's Kelly Air Force Base (KAFB) is one of the Air Force's major aircraft maintenance facilities and takes up 4000 acres of land, surrounded by residential neighborhoods of primarily Hispanic populations. KAFB maintains various parts of aircraft such as jet engines, and accessory components and even nuclear materials, generating as much as 282,000 tons of hazardous waste each year.\\"Kelly Air Force Base: San Antonio's Dumping Ground\\", Txpeer.Org, 2017. Accessed November 16, 2017. Residents of the nearby communities have complained many times of unusual illnesses their children have experienced as well as respiratory illnesses and kidney disease.\\"Silenced Voices From The Toxic Triangle\\". San Antonio Current, 2009. Accessed November 16, 2017. A 1997 survey done in the residential neighborhoods close to KAFB showed 91% of adults and 79% of children are suffering from conditions ranging from nose, ear, and throat issues to central nervous system disorders. Scientists released information in 1983 revealing that toxic waste had been dumped into an uncovered pit from 1960 to 1973. The waste in the pit contained various chemicals, such as PCBs and DDT, that contaminated groundwater.Atsdr.Cdc.Gov, 2017. = West Virginia =  Mexico  = Mexico City = On November 19, 1984, the San Juanico disaster caused thousands of deaths and roughly a million injuries in poor surrounding neighborhoods. The disaster occurred at the PEMEX liquid propane gas plant in a densely populated area of Mexico City. The close proximity of illegally built houses that did not meet regulations worsened the effects of the explosion. = U.S.-Mexico Water Rights and Indigenous People = The Cucap√° are a group of indigenous people that live near the U.S.-Mexico border, mainly in Mexico but some in Arizona as well. For many generations, fishing on the Colorado River was the Cucap√°'s main means of subsistence. In 1944, the United States and Mexico signed a treaty that effectively awarded the United States rights to about 90% of the water in the Colorado River, leaving Mexico with the remaining 10%. Over the last few decades the Colorado River has mostly dried up south of the border, presenting many challenges for people such as the Cucap√°. Shaylih Meuhlmann, author of the ethnography Where the River Ends: Contested Indigeneity in the Mexican Colorado Delta, gives a first-hand account of the situation from Meuhlmann's point of view as well as many accounts from the Cucap√° themselves. In addition to the Mexican portion of the Colorado River being left with a small fraction of the overall available water, the Cucap√° are stripped of the right to fish on the river, the act being made illegal by the Mexican government in the interest of preserving the river's ecological health. The Cucap√° are, thus, living without access to sufficient natural sources of freshwater as well as without their usual means of subsistence. The conclusion drawn in many such cases is that the negotiated water rights under the US-Mexican treaty that lead to the massive disparity in water allotments between the two countries boils down to environmental racism.  Canada  In Canada, progress is being made to address environmental racism (especially in Nova Scotia's Africville community) with the passing of Bill 111, An Act to Address Environmental Racism in the Nova Scotia Legislature. = Europe =  France  Exporting toxic wastes to countries in the Global South is one form of environmental racism that occurs on an international basis. In one alleged instance, the French aircraft carrier Clemenceau was prohibited from entering Alang, an Indian ship-breaking yard, due to a lack of clear documentation about its toxic contents. French President Jacques Chirac ultimately ordered the carrier, which contained tons of hazardous materials including asbestos and PCBs, to return to France.  United Kingdom  In the UK environmental racism (or also climate racism) has been called out by multiple action groups such as the Wretched of the Earth call out letter in 2015 and Black Lives Matter in 2016.  The Netherlands  In the Netherlands environmental racism was campaigned against in 2017 with regard to shipping dirty diesel from Amsterdam and Rotterdam harbor to Africa. The diesel contained 100 times more sulfur than is allowed by European regulation. It was shipped to African countries where lives are less protected and pollution is less regulated.  Italy   Romani people, Eastern Europe  Flag of the Romani people. Predominantly living in Central and Eastern Europe, with pockets of communities in the Americas and Middle East, the ethnic Romani people have been subjected to environmental exclusion. Often referred to as gypsies or the gypsy threat, the Romani people of Eastern Europe mostly live under the poverty line in shanty towns or slums. Facing issues such as long term exposure to harmful toxins given their locations to waste dumps and industrial plants, along with being refused environmental assistance like clean water and sanitation, the Romani people have been facing racism via environmental means. Many countries such has Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary have tried to implement environmental protection initiatives across their respected countries, however most have failed due to \\"addressing the conditions of Roma communities have been framed through an ethnic lens as ‚ÄúRoma issues.\\" Only recently has some form of environmental justice for the Romani people come to light. Seeking environmental justice in Europe, the Environmental Justice Program is now working with human rights organizations to help fight environmental racism. It is important to note that in the \\"Discrimination in the EU in 2009\\" report, conducted by the European Commission, \\"64% of citizens with Roma friends believe discrimination is widespread, compared to 61% of citizens without Roma friends.\\" = Oceania =  Micronesia   Australia  The Australian Environmental Justice (AEJ) is a multidisciplinary organization which is closely partnered with Friends of the Earth Australia (FoEA). The AEJ focuses on recording and remedying the effects of environmental injustice throughout Australia. The AEJ has addressed issues which include \\"production and spread of toxic wastes, pollution of water, soil and air, erosion and ecological damage of landscapes, water systems, plants and animals\\". The project looks for environmental injustices that disproportionately affect a group of people or impact them in a way they did not agree to. The Western Oil Refinery started operating in Bellevue, Western Australia in 1954. It was permitted rights to operate in Bellevue by the Australian government in order to refine cheap and localized oil. In the decades following, many residents of Bellevue claimed they felt respiratory burning due to the inhalation of toxic chemicals and nauseating fumes. Lee Bell from Curtin University and Mariann Lloyd-Smith from the National Toxic Network in Australia stated in their article, \\"Toxic Disputes and the Rise of Environmental Justice in Australia\\" that \\"residents living close to the site discovered chemical contamination in the ground- water surfacing in their back yards\\". Under immense civilian pressure, the Western Oil Refinery (now named Omex) stopped refining oil in 1979. Years later, citizens of Bellevue formed the Bellevue Action Group (BAG) and called for the government to give aid towards the remediation of the site. The government agreed and $6.9 million was allocated to clean up the site. Remediation of site began in April 2000.  Papua New Guinea  Panguna copper mine under construction, 1971 Starting production in 1972, the Panguna mine in Papua New Guinea has been a source of environmental racism. Although closed since 1989 due to conflict on the island, the indigenous peoples (Bougainvillean) have suffered both economically and environmentally from the creation of the mine. Terrance Wesley-Smith and Eugene Ogan, University of Hawaii and University of Minnesota respectively, stated that the Bougainvillean's \\"were grossly disadvantaged from the beginning and no subsequent renegotiation has been able to remedy the situation\\". These indigenous people faced issues such as losing land which could have been used for agricultural practices for the Dapera and Moroni villages, undervalued payment for the land, poor relocation housing for displaced villagers and significant environmental degradation in the surrounding areas. = Asia = China From the mid-1990s until about 2001, it is estimated that some 50 to 80 percent of the electronics collected for recycling in the western half of the United States was being exported for dismantling overseas, predominantly to China and Southeast Asia.Grossman, 189. This scrap processing is quite profitable and preferred due to an abundant workforce, cheap labour, and lax environmental laws.Grossman, 194.Grossman, Elizabeth, High Tech Trash: Digital Devices, Hidden Toxics, and Human Health (Washington: Island Press, 2006), 185. Guiyu, China is one of the largest recycling sites for e-waste, where heaps of discarded computer parts rise near the riverbanks and compounds, such as cadmium, copper, lead, PBDEs, contaminate the local water supply.Grossman, 184. Water samples taken by the Basel Action Network in 2001 from the Lianjiang River contained lead levels 190 times higher than WHO safety standards. Despite contaminated drinking water, residents continue to use contaminated water over expensive trucked-in supplies of drinking water. Nearly 80 percent of children in the e-waste hub of Guiyu, China, suffer from lead poisoning, according to recent reports. Before being used as the destination of electronic waste, most of Guiyu was composed of small farmers who made their living in the agriculture business.Grossman, 187. However, farming has been abandoned for more lucrative work in scrap electronics. \\"According to the Western press and both Chinese university and NGO researchers, conditions in these workers' rural villages are so poor that even the primitive electronic scrap industry in Guiyu offers an improvement in income\\".Grossman, 186-187. India Bhopal, India Union Carbide Corporation, is the parent company of Union Carbide India Limited which outsources its production to an outside country. Located in Bhopal, India, Union Carbide India Limited primarily produced the chemical methyl isocyanate used for pesticide manufacture.Das Gupta, Aruna and Ananda Das Gupta, \\"Corporate Social Responsibility in India: Towards a Sane Society?\\", Social Responsibility Journal, Volume 4, Issue 1 (2008): 213. On December 3, 1984, a cloud of methyl isocyanate leaked as a result of the toxic chemical mixing with water in the plant in Bhopal.LaBar, Gregg, \\"Citizen Carbide?\\", Occupational Hazards, Volume 53, Issue 11 (1991): 33. Approximately 520,000 people were exposed to the toxic chemical immediately after the leak. Within the first 3 days after the leak an estimated 8,000 people living within the vicinity of the plant died from exposure to the methyl isocyanate. Some people survived the initial leak from the factory, but due to improper care and improper diagnoses many have died. As a consequence of improper diagnoses, treatment may have been ineffective and this was precipitated by Union Carbide refusing to release all the details regarding the leaked gases and lying about certain important information. The delay in supplying medical aid to the victims of the chemical leak made the situation for the survivors even worse. Many today are still experiencing the negative health impacts of the methyl isocyanate leak, such as lung fibrosis, impaired vision, tuberculosis, neurological disorders, and severe body pains. The operations and maintenance of the factory in Bhopal contributed to the hazardous chemical leak. The storage of huge volumes of methyl isocyanate in a densely inhabited area, was in contravention with company policies strictly practiced in other plants.Das Gupta, Aruna and Ananda Das Gupta, \\"Corporate Social Responsibility in India: Towards a Sane Society?\\", Social Responsibility Journal, Volume 4, Issue 1 (2008) 214. The company ignored protests that they were holding too much of the dangerous chemical for one plant and built large tanks to hold it in a crowded community. Methyl isocyanate must be stored at extremely low temperatures, but the company cut expenses to the air conditioning system leading to less than optimal conditions for the chemical. Additionally, Union Carbide India Limited never created disaster management plans for the surrounding community around the factory in the event of a leak or spill. State authorities were in the pocket of the company and therefore did not pay attention to company practices or implementation of the law. The company also cut down on preventive maintenance staff to save money. = South America = Ecuador 253x253px Due to their lack of environmental laws, emerging countries like Ecuador have been subjected to environmental pollution, sometimes causing health problems, loss of agriculture, and poverty. In 1993, 30,000 Ecuadorians, which included Cofan, Siona, Huaorani, and Quichua indigenous people, filed a lawsuit against Texaco oil company for the environmental damages caused by oil extraction activities in the Lago Agrio oil field. After handing control of the oil fields to an Ecuadorian oil company, Texaco did not properly dispose of its hazardous waste, causing great damages to the ecosystem and crippling communities.Copland, Liesl; Kamen, Jon; Berlinger, Joe. 2009. Crude: The Real Price of Oil; United States. Entendre Films, Red Envelope Entertainment.  Mapuche-Chilean Land Conflict  Beginning in the late 15th century when European explorers began sailing to the New World, the violence towards and oppression of indigenous populations have had lasting effects to this day. The Mapuche-Chilean land conflict has roots dating back several centuries. When the Spanish went to conquer parts of South America, the Mapuche were one of the only indigenous groups to successfully resist Spanish domination and maintain their sovereignty. Moving forward, relations between the Mapuche and the Chilean state declined into a condition of malice and resentment. Chile won its independence from Spain in 1818 and, wanting the Mapuche to assimilate into the Chilean state, began crafting harmful legislation that targeted the Mapuche. The Mapuche have based their economy, both historically and presently, on agriculture. By the mid-19th century, the state resorted to outright seizure of Mapuche lands, forcefully appropriating all but 5% of Mapuche lineal lands. An agrarian economy without land essentially meant that the Mapuche no longer had their means of production and subsistence. While some land has since been ceded back to the Mapuche, it is still a fraction of what the Mapuche once owned. Further, as the Chilean state has attempted to rebuild its relationship with the Mapuche community, the connection between the two is still strained by the legacy of the aforementioned history. Today, the Mapuche people are the largest population of indigenous people in Chile, with 1.5 million people accounting for over 90% of the country's indigenous population. = Africa = Nigeria In Nigeria, near the Niger Delta, cases of oil spills, burning of toxic waste, and urban air pollution are problems in more developed areas. In the early 1990s, Nigeria was among the 50 nations with the world's highest levels of carbon dioxide emissions, which totaled 96,500 kilotons, a per capita level of 0.84 metric tons. The UN reported in 2008 that carbon dioxide emissions in Nigeria totaled 95,194 kilotons. Numerous webpages were created in support of the Ogoni people, who are indigenous to Nigeria's oil-rich Delta region. Sites were used to protest the disastrous environmental and economic effects of Shell Oil drilling, to urge the boycotting of Shell Oil, and to denounce human rights abuses by the Nigerian government and by Shell. The use of the Internet in formulating an international appeal intensified dramatically after the Nigerian government's November 1995 execution of nine Ogoni activists, including Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was one of the founders of the nonviolent Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP).  South Africa  The linkages between the mining industry and the negative impacts it has on community and individual health has been studied and well-documented by a number of organizations worldwide. Health implications of living in proximity to mining operations include effects such as pregnancy complications, mental health issues, various forms of cancer, and many more. During the Apartheid period in South Africa, the mining industry grew quite rapidly as a result of the lack of environmental regulation. Communities in which mining corporations operate are usually those with high rates of poverty and unemployment. Further, within these communities, there is typically a divide among the citizens on the issue of whether the pros of mining in terms of economic opportunity outweigh the cons in terms of the health of the people in the community. Mining companies often try to use these disagreements to their advantage by magnifying this conflict. Additionally, mining companies in South Africa have close ties with the national government, skewing the balance of power in their favor while simultaneously excluding local people from many decision-making processes. This legacy of exclusion has had lasting effects in the form of impoverished South Africans bearing the brunt of ecological impacts resulting from the actions of, for example, mining companies. Some argue that to effectively fight environmental racism and achieve some semblance of justice, there must also be a reckoning with the factors that form situations of environmental racism such as rooted and institutionalized mechanisms of power, social relations, and cultural elements. The term ‚Äúenergy poverty‚Äù is used to refer to ‚Äúa lack of access to adequate, reliable, affordable and clean energy carriers and technologies for meeting energy service needs for cooking and those activities enabled by electricity to support economic and human development‚Äù. Numerous communities in South Africa face some sort of energy poverty. South African women are typically in charge of taking care of both the home and the community as a whole. Those in economically impoverished areas not only have to take on this responsibility, but there are numerous other challenges they face. Discrimination on the basis of gender, race, and class are all still present in South African culture. Because of this, women, who are the primary users of public resources in their work at home and for the community, are often excluded from any decision- making about control and access to public resources. The resulting energy poverty forces women to use sources of energy that are expensive and may be harmful both to their own health and that of the environment. Consequently, several renewable energy initiatives have emerged in South Africa specifically targeting these communities and women to correct this situation. Addressing environmental racism Activists have called for \\"more participatory and citizen-centered conceptions of justice.\\" Checker, Melissa. 2005. Polluted Promises: Environmental Racism and the Search for Justice in a Southern Town. New York: New York University Press, pp. 122-123Checker, Melissa. \\"Withered Memories: Naming and Fighting Environmental Racism in Georgia.\\" In New Landscapes of Inequality: Neoliberalism and the Erosion of Democracy in America, eds. Jane L. Collins, Micaela di Leonardo, and Brett Williams. Santa Fe, NM: School for Advanced Research Press. The environmental justice (EJ) movement and climate justice (CJ) movement address environmental racism in bringing attention and enacting change so that marginalized populations are not disproportionately vulnerable to climate change and pollution. According to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, one possible solution is the precautionary principle, which states that \\"where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.\\" UNCED. (5-16 June 1972). \\"Rio Declaration on Environment and Development\\", United Nations Environment Programme. Under this principle, the initiator of the potentially hazardous activity is charged with demonstrating the activity's safety. Environmental justice activists also emphasize the need for waste reduction in general, which would act to reduce the overall burden. Concentrations of ethnic or racial minorities may also foster solidarity, lending support in spite of challenges and providing the concentration of social capital necessary for grassroots activism. Citizens who are tired of being subjected to the dangers of pollution in their communities have been confronting the power structures through organized protest, legal actions, marches, civil disobedience, and other activities.Weintraub, I. 1994. \\"Fighting Environmental Racism: A Selected Annotated Bibliography,\\" Electronic Green Journal, Issue 1. Racial minorities are often excluded from politics and urban planning (such as sea level rise adaptation planning) so various perspectives of an issue are not included in policy making that may affect these excluded groups in the future. In general, political participation in African American communities is correlated with the reduction of health risks and mortality. Other strategies in battling against large companies include public hearings, the elections of supporters to state and local offices, meetings with company representatives, and other efforts to bring about public awareness and accountability.Bullard, Robert D. 1990. Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Equity. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, p. 165. In addressing this global issue, activists take to various social media platforms to both raise awareness and call to action. The mobilization and communication between the intersectional grassroots movements where race and environmental imbalance meet has proven to be effective. The movement gained traction with the help of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat among other platforms. Celebrities such as Shailene Woodley, who advocated against the Keystone XL Pipeline, have shared their experiences including that of being arrested for protesting. Social media has allowed for a facilitated conversation between peers and the rest of the world when it comes to social justice issues not only online but in face-to-face interactions correspondingly. =Studies= Studies have been important in drawing associations and public attention by exposing practices that cause marginalized communities to be more vulnerable to environmental health hazards. Deserting the Perpetrator-Victim Model of studying environmental justice issues, the Economic/Environmental Justice Model utilized a sharper lens to study the many complex factors, accompanied to race, that contributes to the act of environmental racism and injustice. For example, Lerner not only revealed the role of race in the division of Diamond and Norco residents, but he also revealed the historical roles of the Shell Oil Company, the slave ancestry of Diamond residents, and of the history of white workers and families that were dependent upon the rewards of Shell. Involvement of outside organizations, such as the Bucket Brigade and Greenpeace, was also considered in the power that the Diamond community had when battling for environmental justice. In wartimes, environmental racism occurs in ways that the public later learn about through reports. For example, Friends of the Earth International's Environmental Nakba report brings attention to environmental racism that has occurred in the Gaza Strip during the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. Some Israeli practices include cutting off three days of water supply to refugee Palestinians and destroying farms. Besides studies that point out cases of environmental racism, studies have also provided information on how to go about changing regulations and preventing environmental racism from happening. In a study by Daum, Stoler and Grant on e-waste management in Accra, Ghana, the importance of engaging with different fields and organizations such as recycling firms, communities, and scrap metal traders are emphasized over adaptation strategies such as bans on burning and buy-back schemes that have not caused much effect on changing practices. Studies have also shown that since environmental laws have become prominent in developed countries, companies have moved their waste towards the Global South. Less developed countries have fewer environmental policies and therefore are susceptible to more discriminatory practices. Although this has not stopped activism, it has limited the effects activism has on political restrictions. = Procedural Justice = Current political ideologies surrounding how to make right issues of environmental racism and environmental justice are shifting towards the idea of employing procedural justice. Procedural justice is a concept that dictates the use of fairness in the process of making decisions, especially when said decisions are being made in diplomatic situations such as the allocation of resources or the settling of disagreements. Procedural justice calls for a fair, transparent, impartial decision-making process with equal opportunity for all parties to voice their positions, opinions, and concerns. Rather than just focusing on the outcomes of agreements and the effects those outcomes have on affected populations and interest groups, procedural justice looks to involve all stakeholders throughout the process from planning through implementation. In terms of combating environmental racism, procedural justice helps to reduce the opportunities for powerful actors such as often-corrupt states or private entities to dictate the entire decision-making process and puts some power back into the hands of those who will be directly affected by the decisions being made. = Activism = Activism takes many forms. One form is collective demonstrations or protests, which can take place on a number of different levels from local to international. Additionally, in places where activists feel as though governmental solutions will work, organizations and individuals alike can pursue direct political action. In many cases, activists and organizations will form partnerships both regionally and internationally to gain more clout in pursuit of their goals. Before the 1970s, communities of color recognized the reality of environmental racism and organized against it. For example, the Black Panther Party organized survival programs that confronted the inequitable distribution of trash in predominantly black neighborhoods.(1973). The Black Panther. Retrieved from http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/Survival_Programs/pdf/Survival_Programs.pdf Similarly, the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican revolutionary nationalist organization based in Chicago and New York City, protested pollution and toxic refuse present in their community via the Garbage Offensive program. These and other organizations also worked to confront the unequal distribution of open spaces, toxic lead paint, and healthy food options.Enck-Wanzer, D. (2010). The Young Lords: A Reader. New York: New York University Press They also offered health programs to those affected by preventable, environmentally induced diseases such as tuberculosis. In this way, these organizations serve as precursors to more pointed movements against environmental racism. Latino ranch laborers composed by Cesar Chavez battled for working environment rights, including insurance from harmful pesticides in the homestead fields of California's San Joaquin Valley. In 1967, African-American understudies rioted in the streets of Houston to battle a city trash dump in their locale which had killed two kids. In 1968, occupants of West Harlem, in New York City, battled unsuccessfully against the siting of a sewage treatment plant in their neighborhood. Efforts of activism have also been heavily influenced by women and the injustices they face from environmental racism. Women of different races, ethnicities, economic status, age, and gender are disproportionately affected by issues of environmental injustice. Additionally, the efforts made by women have historically been overlooked or challenged by efforts made by men, as the problems women face have been often avoided or ignored. Winona LaDuke is one of many female activists working on environmental issues, in which she fights against injustices faced by indigenous communities. LaDuke was inducted into the National Women‚Äôs Hall of Fame in 2007 for her continuous leadership towards justice. =Policies and international agreements= The export of hazardous waste to third world countries is another growing concern. Between 1989 and 1994, an estimated 2,611 metric tons of hazardous waste was exported from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD countries. Two international agreements were passed in response to the growing exportation of hazardous waste into their borders. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was concerned that the Basel Convention adopted in March 1989 did not include a total ban on the trans-boundary movement on hazardous waste. In response to their concerns, on January 30, 1991, the Pan-African Conference on Environmental and Sustainable Development adopted the Bamako Convention banning the import of all hazardous waste into Africa and limiting their movement within the continent. In September 1995, the G-77 nations helped amend the Basel Convention to ban the export of all hazardous waste from industrial countries (mainly OECD countries and Lichtenstein) to other countries. A resolution was signed in 1988 by the OA) which declared toxic waste dumping to be a ‚Äúcrime against Africa and the African people‚Äù. Soon after, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) passed a resolution that allowed for penalties, such as life imprisonment, to those who were caught dumping toxic wastes. Globalization and the increase in transnational agreements introduce possibilities for cases of environmental racism. For example, the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) attracted US-owned factories to Mexico, where toxic waste was abandoned in the Colonia Chilpancingo community and was not cleaned up until activists called for the Mexican government to clean up the waste. Environmental justice movements have grown to become an important part of world summits. This issue is gathering attention and features a wide array of people, workers, and levels of society that are working together. Concerns about globalization can bring together a wide range of stakeholders including workers, academics, and community leaders for whom increased industrial development is a common denominator‚Äù. Many policies can be expounded based on the state of human welfare. This occurs because environmental justice is obviously aimed at creating safe, fair, and equal opportunity for communities and to ensure things like redlining do not occur. With all of these unique elements in mind, there are serious ramifications for policy makers to consider when they make decisions.

In the event of forfeiture, the score is recorded as 9‚Äì0, as stated in rule 2.00 of the Major League Baseball Rules Book. The 9‚Äì0 score equates to the number of innings in a regulation game. Actual game statistics are recorded as they stand at the time of the forfeit; the game is recorded as a loss in the standings for the forfeiting team and a win for the other team, even if the forfeiting team is ahead at that point. Although not uncommon in baseball's early days, forfeits are now rare. There have been only five forfeits in Major League Baseball since 1954; the last forfeit was in 1995, and prior to that, 1979. Since 1914, there has only been one incident where a team deliberately made a decision to forfeit a game, by the 1977 Baltimore Orioles. Sports with seven-inning games, such as high school baseball or softball, generally award a rule-based score of 7‚Äì0. The same is true for Little League Baseball, per Rule 2.00, under the definition of \\"Forfeit\\", there is one run allocated per inning, so for Minors and Majors divisions, that would be score of 6‚Äì0, and for Intermediate and above divisions, that would be a score of 7‚Äì0. In college baseball, the NCAA has the authority to retroactively forfeit games if the winning team is found to have violated NCAA rules, however this is a general NCAA rule and not one exclusive to baseball. Regardless of the sport, in the NCAA games are usually forfeited retroactively as a consequence of recruiting violations, if players and/or teams are caught violating the NCAA's strict rules regarding amateurism and/or if (a) player(s) are otherwise found to have been ineligible to play for some reason. Retroactive forfeiture can also happen for Little League World Series games, and occurred following the 1992 and 2014 events.  MLB forfeits before 1970  Forfeits were more common in the early days of Major League Baseball. In 1871, six games were forfeited in two months. There was at least one forfeit almost every year from 1882 until 1909. 1884 saw forfeits in the double digits, many because one team failed to appear for a game or refused to continue playing. Game 2 of the 1885 World Series was forfeited when St. Louis pulled its team from the field to protest the umpiring. There were five forfeits in the National League in 1886. The high rate of forfeits slowed after 1910, with one forfeit every few years. Game 7 of the 1934 World Series was in jeopardy of being forfeited when Detroit Tigers fans began showering the outfield with debris after St. Louis Cardinals left fielder Joe Medwick slid hard into Tigers third baseman Marv Owen; however, a potential black eye to the Series was averted when Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ordered both Medwick and Owen replaced in the one-sided game. In games that were played before the advent of stadium lighting (or had an enforced curfew), forfeits were also sometimes declared as a result of a team's stalling tactics. A baseball game is not official until 5 innings have been completed, or innings if the home team is winning. Consequently, a team that was behind by a considerable number of runs before the end of the fifth inning might deliberately slow down the game, in the hopes that darkness or the curfew would come before the game was declared official. Note, however, that deliberate attempts to slow down play for this reason are subject to a forfeiture being declared. The last such incident took place in 1954. On July 18, the visiting Philadelphia Phillies were leading the hometown St. Louis Cardinals 8‚Äì1 in the fifth inning of the second game of a doubleheader. With darkness approaching and the game not yet official, Cardinals manager Eddie Stanky brought in three new pitchers in the inning. Umpire Babe Pinelli, citing an unnecessary delay of the game on the part of the Cardinals, forfeited the game to the Phillies. Forfeits have become extremely rare in recent years. The advent of night baseball has eliminated the use of stalling tactics to beat the sunset. No major league city has been regularly subject to a general curfew in recent decades. In the sort of extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a temporary curfew in a city scheduled to host MLB games (such as the 1989 World Series earthquake), it is extremely unlikely Major League Baseball would allow the game(s) to be played. In such cases, MLB typically reschedules the game(s) or moves the game(s) to the opponents' stadium or a neutral venue. In one exceptional case when the 2015 Baltimore protests caused local authorities to impose a curfew, MLB satisfied the terms of the curfew by ordering the affected game to be played earlier in the day and without spectators. Of the five forfeits that have occurred in the expansion era of baseball (post-1960), all but one have been the result of fans disrupting the game to a point where the stadium staff cannot control them, at which point the home team is forced to forfeit.  MLB forfeits since 1970 * Washington Senators' final game at RFK Stadium: On September 30, 1971, the home team led the New York Yankees by 7‚Äì5 with two outs in the top of the ninth inning. Senators fans were angered by the team's impending move to Dallas-Fort Worth, where the Senators were to become the Texas Rangers in 1972. Forgetting one out was left in the game, they stormed the field and vandalized the stadium. With no prospect of order being restored after the security staff had simply left during the game, resulting in many fans walking in without paying, the umpires forfeited the game to the Yankees. * Ten Cent Beer Night: A promotion held by the Cleveland Indians on June 4, 1974, backfired when intoxicated Cleveland fans ran onto the field and attacked Texas Rangers outfielder Jeff Burroughs with the score tied 5‚Äì5 in the ninth inning. This led to a riot in which the drunk and rowdy fans, armed with an array of improvised weapons and various other objects, including chunks of the stadium seating, brawled with players and officials from both teams as well as with the umpires, who subsequently forfeited the game to Texas. * During the September 15, 1977, game between the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition Stadium, the grounds crew placed a tarpaulin over the two mounds in the Blue Jays' bullpen, which was in foul territory, outside the left field foul line after light rain. Before the start of the bottom of the fifth inning (with the Blue Jays leading 4‚Äì0), Orioles manager Earl Weaver came out of the dugout and claimed to umpire Marty Springstead that the tarp endangered his players by exposing them to the risk that they could slip or trip on it when entering the bullpen to catch a fly ball; Weaver ordered his team from the field, and said that they would not return until the tarp was removed. Springstead ordered the tarp removed from the mound that was closest to fair territory, but not the tarp from the other mound, and told Weaver that he could play the game under protest. After arguing with Springstead for nearly twenty minutes, Weaver returned to the dugout. Springstead then waited five minutes (the period of time specified by the rule book) for the Orioles to retake the field. When Weaver said they would not do so, Springstead ordered the game forfeited to the Blue Jays.\\"Orioles Lose by a Forfeit in Bull-Pen Mound Dispute,\\" United Press International (UPI), Thursday, September 15, 1977. Retrieved May 14, 2020 * Disco Demolition Night: On July 12, 1979, the Chicago White Sox held a promotion in which Chicago radio personality Steve Dahl came onto the field to blow up a box full of disco records between games of a doubleheader with the Detroit Tigers. After the box was blown up, rowdy and intoxicated fans who had packed Comiskey Park beyond capacity stormed the field, engaged in various acts of vandalism and theft, and did not leave the field until Chicago Police arrived in full riot gear. The field was so badly damaged that the umpires and managers decided the second game could not be played. American League President Lee MacPhail later forfeited the second game to Detroit. * On August 10, 1995, the Los Angeles Dodgers gave out baseballs to paying customers as they entered the Dodger Stadium gates for a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Fans interrupted the game in the seventh inning when they threw these baseballs onto the field, and again in the bottom of the ninth inning, with the Cardinals leading 2‚Äì1, when the first Dodgers batter, Ra√∫l Mondes√≠, was called out on strikes and ejected by home plate umpire Jim Quick for arguing, followed by Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda moments later for arguing with and abusing Quick. Dodger fans, fueled by a series of close calls, again threw their souvenir baseballs onto the field. The Cardinals left the field due to safety concerns, causing a several-minute delay, but when the Cardinals returned to the field, Dodgers fans threw more balls out of the center field bleachers, forcing the umpires to forfeit the game to St. Louis. As a result of this incident, Major League Baseball ruled that in any future promotional giveaways of baseballs or any other throwable object, the items would be given out as fans exited the stadium.

In this therapy, acidic topical medicines, such as Whitfield's ointment or Jessner's solution, are applied to the lesion in order to thin the skin on and around it. This therapy causes the outer layer of the skin to loosen and shed. Keratolytics can also be used to soften keratin, a major component of the skin. This serves to improve the skin's moisture binding capacity, which is beneficial in the treatment of dry skin. Such agents (keratolytics) include alkali (by swelling and hydrolysis of skin), salicylic acid, urea, lactic acid, allantoin, glycolic acid, and trichloroacetic acid. While cytostatic agents such as zinc pyrithione are first line, keratolytics (salicylic acid and sulfur) can also be used in the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Sulfur and salicylic acid can also be used to effectively treat acne and cradle cap in some patients. Resorcinol is another keratolytic that is usually combined with sulfur.

Due to injuries caused by these high risk moves, some promotions have banned the use of some of them. The next list of maneuvers was made under general categories whenever possible. Attacks =Diving chops= The Undertaker jumping down from the top rope to strike Heidenreich with Old School Arm twist ropewalk chop The wrestler takes hold of one of the opponent's wrists, twisting the arm into an arm wrench. The wrestler then climbs up the corner turnbuckles and takes a walk on the top rope before falling down striking the opponent's head, back, shoulder or nape with a chop. This is more known as Old School, the name used by The Undertaker, who popularized it. Diving overhead chop Standing on the top turnbuckle, the attacking wrestler proceeds to jump in order to deliver an overhead chop to a standing opponent's head. This is one of the most recognizable signature moves performed by Tatanka, who called it the Tomahawk Chop. Kane performing a flying clothesline on CM Punk =Diving clothesline= The attacking wrestler jumps from an elevated position as extending their arm out from the side of the body and parallel to the ground, hitting the standing opponent in the neck or chest, knocking them over.

This is usually done on a standing or rising opponent. A common variation sees the wrestler standing over the top rope, facing away from the ring. From this point, the wrestler jumps, twisting to face inside of the ring, and quickly clutching both fists together to strike the double axe handle. =Diving drops= Diving leg drop Also called guillotine leg drop, this move sees a wrestler jumping from a raised platform landing the bottom side of one leg across the opponent's throat or chest. =Moonsault leg drop= This variation sees the wrestler performing a moonsault but instead of landing on the opponent in a splash position, the wrestler continues the rotation to drive a leg across the downed opponent. =Shooting star leg drop= The wrestler jumps forward from an elevated position following a full 360¬∞ or beyond rotation, driving a leg across the fallen opponent. =Somersault leg drop= The wrestler, standing on an elevated position, jumps and flips forward to land one leg on the opponent lying beneath.

Diving elbow drop Mark Briscoe performing a diving elbow drop on Colin Delaney Executed by diving onto a supine opponent with one elbow cocked, driving the elbow into the opponent as the wrestler falls on one of their sides. The move was popularized by WWE Wrestler Randy \\"Macho Man\\" Savage, Former WWE superstar Kairi Sane used this move, named as InSane Elbow. Bayley also uses it as a homage to Randy \\"Macho Man\\" Savage. =Diving back elbow drop= This less common variation sees a wrestler stand facing away from a standing or supine opponent and in an elevated position (usually the top turnbuckle). The wrestler then dives backwards to strike the opponent. It was popularized by Randy Savage, and is used by various wrestlers such as Jay Lethal, CM Punk, Bayley and Velveteen Dream.

Diving fist drop A move in which a wrestler jumps down from the turnbuckle on an opponent, driving their fist into the opponent's head. While doing it, wrestlers have their front four knuckles out, and their thumb to the side. This move was popularized by Jerry Lawler as his finisher. Chris Benoit performing a diving headbutt on MVP at WrestleMania 23 Diving headbutt Also known as a diving headbutt drop, it is delivered from the turnbuckle to anywhere on the opponent's body. The move was accidentally innovated by Harley Race, who adapted it as a signature move and it was then further popularized by The Dynamite Kid, Chris Benoit, Daniel Bryan and Lars Sullivan. It was later discovered that this move could cause severe spinal, brain, legs, or chest damage. Regarded nowadays as one of the most dangerous moves in professional wrestling. Diving knee drop A move in which a wrestler jumps from the top turnbuckle, top rope, or the apron, landing one knee across a supine opponent. There is also a variation where a wrestler jumps from the elevated position and lands both knees across the prone opponent, referred to as a diving double knee drop. =Meteora= This version of the diving double knee drop sees the attacker performing the maneuver from an elevated platform, jumping forward onto a standing or seated upright opponent with each knee striking both of their shoulders simultaneously. Springboard, slingshot, and standing or running versions of this move are also possible with the latter being used while the attacker is charging towards an opponent, against a charging opponent, or a combination of both. Innovated by CIMA, who has used both a springboard and top rope version as finishing maneuvers in Dragon Gate, and named it after the Greek landmark where he proposed to his wife. Sasha Banks is also known to use the meteora in WWE as a transitional move, being a Dragon Gate fan. =Shooting star knee drop= This move sees the wrestler jumping forward from the second turnbuckle, executing a mid-air backflip, landing knee first on an opponent down all on fours.

Diving seated senton Razor Ramon HG performing a seated senton This variant has the wrestler using the tailbone and lower back to fall in a seated position forcing a standing opponent to the mat rather than using their whole back. Performed by jumping forward off a raised platform or springboarding on to the opponent's shoulders, forcing them to the ground. This can also be performed onto an opponent prone or supine on the mat. A variation of this move known as the Banzai Drop, popularized by Yokozuna, sees the wrestler standing over a fallen opponent next to the turnbuckle, then climbing up to the second rope and jumping down, landing on the opponent's stomach or chest. Kelly Kelly performing the Molly-go-round at WrestleMania XXVIII =Molly-Go-Round= This variant, which is technically described as a diving somersault seated senton is performed by flipping forward off a raised platform on to the shoulders of a standing opponent, forcing them to the ground into a pinning position. Innovated by Molly Holly. Tegan Nox uses this move. Moonsault senton The attacker jumps to the top turnbuckle or top rope facing away from the ring, and executes a moonsault, landing in an ordinary senton position. There is also a standing version of this move. Senton bomb In this variation, the attacking wrestler executes a quick front somersault off the top turnbuckle, landing on the opponent back-first. Popularized by Jim Fullington and renaming it as Rolling Rock.

Corner slingshot splash The wrestler places the opponent lying supine perpendicular to the turnbuckle. Then approaching to the turnbuckle in the same corner, grabbing a hold both hands on the top rope and climbing to the first or second rope, the wrestler bounces on the ropes before throwing both legs backwards and placing the body parallel to the mat as releasing the ropes, thus falling inwards and downwards to the ring squashing and pinning the opponent. Often referred to as Vader Bomb, for it was (Big Van) Vader who popularized it. Jack Swagger used this move as his signature in WWE, calling it a Swagger Bomb. AJ Lee performing a diving crossbody on Nikki Bella at WWE WrestleMania 31 Diving crossbody To perform the move, the wrestler jumps from an elevated position (usually the top turnbuckle) onto an opponent, landing horizontally across the opponent's torso, forcing them to the mat and usually resulting in a pinfall attempt. There is also a reversed version, called a reverse crossbody, where the wrestler faces away from the prone opponent before executing the maneuver. This move is one of the basic moves of lightweight wrestlers. Eddie Guerrero performs a frog splash on Danny Basham. Frog splash This move is performed by leaping from the top rope, stretching out to a horizontal position, and bringing one's feet and hands inward and outward before landing. Eddie Guerrero made the frog splash famous in the mid-1990s and early 2000s. However, the move itself was innovated by La Fiera in Mexico in the early 1980s. Later it was used by Art Barr in the late 1980s and was named by 2 Cold Scorpio who remarked Barr looked \\"like a frog\\" whilst performing the move which resulted in Barr naming it. After Barr's death in 1994, Guerrero used the move in tribute to his fallen tag team partner.Cheating Death, Stealing Life ‚Äì The Eddie Guerrero Story (DVD, 2004) There is a high-angle turning variation named the Five-Star Frog Splash where the opponent is not placed perpendicular to the corner. Instead, the attacker turns mid-air to land on the opponent in the splash position, regardless of which direction the opponent is lying in. It was made famous by ECW, WWF/E and TNA superstar Rob Van Dam as it was used as his finisher. He also uses a regular version, generally going halfway or more than halfway across the ring to hit his opponent. Spike Dudley hitting a diving double foot stomp on Rodney Mack =Diving stomp= The wrestler jumps down from a raised platform onto an opponent, dropping one foot onto the opponent's body. A variation known as a diving double foot stomp sees the attacking wrestler jumping down from a raised platform on an opponent, driving both feet into the opponent. Finn Balor uses this as his finishing move, Coup de Gr√¢ce. Moonsault double foot stomp This variation sees the wrestler perform a moonsault, but instead of landing on a fallen opponent in the splash position, the wrestler continues the rotation driving both feet into the opponent. Sonjay Dutt uses this as an occasional finishing move, named Moonstomp. Mushroom stomp While situated on the middle turnbuckle, a wrestler jumps over a charging opponent, driving one or both feet into the opponent's back, pushing the opponent into the turnbuckle or down to the ground, before landing on their feet. The technique's name is a reference to the stomping attacks used by video game character Mario. Current NXT wrestler Cameron Grimes uses this as a finisher, named Cave-In. =Flying body press= Differentiating themselves from a splash or a senton, these maneuvers are performed from an upright position, using momentum and weight to run over a standing opponent or pin a fallen one. It's used by Hiroshi Tanahashi as the High Fly Flow. Falling Thesz press Sitting on the top turnbuckle, the attacking wrestler rests both feet with spread legs on the second ropes waiting for an incoming opponent, then jumps forward through springboarding to sit on the opponent's midsection as in a standing Thesz press. Brock Lesnar failed to achieve a shooting star press on Kurt Angle at WrestleMania XIX, suffering neck injuries and a concussion as a result. Shooting star press A technique invented by Jushin Thunder Liger. The wrestler jumps forward from an elevated position and presses their knees to their own chest, executes a backflip and lands on the opponent as if performing a body press. This move was used by Brock Lesnar and is Matt Sydal's finisher, but was popularized by Billy Kidman in WCW. The move was previously banned in WWE in 2005 for safety reasons, as the move can easily be botched and cause serious injuries, much like the piledriver. Neville performing a corkscrew shooting star press on Finn B√°lor =Corkscrew shooting star press= This move sees a wrestler jump forward while twisting 360¬∞ and performing a backflip. This move is used and has been popularized by PAC who called it the Red Arrow, and later the Black Arrow. It is also known for being used by Will Ospreay and Komander. =Flying kicks= Several attacks taken from eastern martial arts to Lucha libre, these are widely popular maneuvers amongst fans worldwide. Diving calf kick Standing over the top turnbuckle or top rope, the attacking wrestler jumps off and twists slightly so as soaring midair faces away from the opponent, connecting the side of their lead leg's calf-heel cord area to the opponent's face or chest. Diving leg lariat A leg lariat in which a wrestler jumps from a raised platform towards an opponent and wraps one leg around the opponent's head or neck, knocking them down to the ground. Flying spinning heel kick A move in which the wrestler jumps from an elevated position (usually the top turnbuckle) and strikes a standing opponent with a spinning heel kick mid-air. Flying thrust kick Executed when a wrestler jumps from a raised platform (usually the top turnbuckle), and performs a mid-air back kick on a standing opponent. Throws =Diamond dust= This maneuver is performed by an attacking wrestler standing or sitting on an elevated platform facing the back of a standing opponent while applying an inverted facelock. From this position, the attacking wrestler somersaults forward to roll the inverted facelock into a ¬æ facelock. As they fall, the wrestler either drops to a seated position driving the opponent's jaw into their shoulder, or back-first forcing the opponent's face into the mat. Innovated by Masato Tanaka. =Diving hurricanrana= This move is executed by jumping forward off the top rope with legs apart, then straddling on a standing opponent's shoulders and using the momentum to snap off, rolling and throwing the opponent forward. This move was popularized by Lita. CM Punk performing a Frankensteiner on Daniel Bryan Louis Lyndon (below) executes a top-rope Frankensteiner on Ty Colton Frankensteiner This variant is executed on an opponent sitting on the top turnbuckle. With the attacking wrestler's legs scissored around the opponent's head while they face each other, the wrestler backflips to swing through the opponent's open legs, dragging the opponent into a forced somersault that distances the wrestler from the opponent, who lands back-first. The name comes from Scott Steiner, who invented the move. A handstand variation can also be used. With the opponent seated on the top turnbuckle facing the ring, the wrestler performs a handspring on the bottom turnbuckle, wrapping both shins or feet around the opponent's neck. The wrestler then throws both legs forward towards the ring, pulling and flipping over the opponent to the mat back first. =Reverse Frankensteiner= Also known as Inverted Frankensteiner or Poisoned Frankensteiner, this is executed on an opponent sitting on the top turnbuckle. However, the opponent is facing away from the ring on the top turnbuckle thus the opponent backflips over and lands face first. This move can also be performed to the outside of the ring if the opponent is facing the inside of the ring or sitting on one edge of the corner turnbuckle facing the audience both legs outside of the ring on the same side. There is also a standing variation of this move in which the wrestler jumps onto the opponent's shoulders from behind and then flips backwards driving the opponent's head or chest onto the mat. Dragonrana In this variant the wrestler performs a front flip from the top rope before executing a true hurricanrana into a pin. The technique is named by and after Dragon Kid, who popularized the maneuver. Phoenixrana With this variant the wrestler, facing away from the ring and situated on the top turnbuckle, performs a 180¬∞ turn in mid-air and then performs a front flip before executing a pinning hurricanrana. =Shiranui= KL Murphy performing a shiranui A backflip inverted facelock drop where a wrestler puts the opponent into a ¬æ facelock, then runs up the corner turnbuckles or ring ropes and jump backwards performing a backflip, and landing face down driving the opponent down to the mat back-first. Sometimes a standing variant is performed by wrestlers with adequate leaping ability or when assisted by a tag team partner. The move is popularly known, especially in North America, as Sliced Bread No. 2, a name created by wrestler Brian Kendrick and used by many other wrestlers, notably AJ Lee and Eva Marie. In a slight variation named sitout shiranui the wrestler lands into a seated position instead, driving the opponent's head between the legs. =Sunset flip= A pinning move where wrestler and opponent face each other, with the wrestler on higher ground (such as the top turnbuckle). The wrestler dives over the opponent, catches them in a waistlock from behind, and rolls into a sitting position landing onto the mat. As the wrestler rolls over, the opponent is pulled over backwards, landing back first in a rana. Transition moves Some moves are meant neither to pin an opponent, nor weaken them or force them to submit, but intended to set up the attack on the opponent. =Corkscrew= The term implies adding a spiral resembling a corkscrew to a maneuver. It can also refer to the motion when a backflip is twisted around so the attacker faces the inside of the ring instead of the outside when the maneuver ends. =Moonsault= A wrestler executes a backflip and lands torso first on the opponent. A basic moonsault is generally attempted from the top turnbuckle, though myriad variations exist. =Ropewalk= As the name implies, this term is used to refer to any move which sees the attacking wrestler walking along the top rope before performing a move. =Shooting star= When a wrestler jumps forward from an elevated position and executes a mid-air backflip. Many techniques can be performed. =Springboard= Chris Jericho performing a lionsault (springboard moonsault) on Kurt Angle When a wrestler using any of the ring ropes bounces upward. Most high-flying techniques can be performed after a spring board. Sometimes wrestlers will bounce off one set of ring ropes then off another to perform a move, this is referred to as a double springboard. A variation of a springboard is the rope run or climb, in which a wrestler runs up, effectively with one foot off each ring rope. =Slingshot= When a wrestler, standing on the ring apron, pulls on the top rope using the momentum to hurl over the ropes and into the ring. =Somersault= A simple front-flip used to modify an aerial technique. A corkscrew is often added to the somersault to further modify a move. Modifiers Kofi Kingston performing a plancha on Jack Swagger and The Miz =Plancha= An accepted term in American wrestling for a springboard crossbody where the wrestler goes from the inside of the ring over the top ring rope to the outside. In lucha libre, this variant is often called a \\"pescado\\" (Spanish for \\"fish\\") since a proper plancha is referring to any kind of crossbody. In America, however, a move from the top turnbuckle to a standing opponent on the outside where the chests impact each other is commonly referred to as such. It is also used to refer to any attack from the ring to the outside in which the wrestlers' chests impact each other. For example, a shooting star press to the outside onto a standing opponent is referred to as a shooting star plancha. =Standing= The term is used to refer to any move performed at the same level the opponent, usually right on the mat, rather than most aerial moves where the attacking wrestler performs them from a raised platform. Brodie Lee performing a suicide dive onto Michael Elgin =Suicide= Often referred to in Spanish, suicida, is a term placed before any move that goes from any of the ring parts to the outside of the ring. The most common example is the suicide dive known as top√© suicida (Spanish for \\"suicide headbutt\\"). When a somersault is performed after leaping through the ropes, or by jumping over the top rope, to land on the opponent back first, the move is known as a suicide senton or top√© con giro (Sp. spinning headbutt). Outside Mexico, the move is incorrectly referred to as top√© con hilo, for it was mistranslated in Japan (Since hilo in Spanish actually means thread) and the term has remained as such. =Super= This term (often exchanged for diving, elevated or top-rope) is placed before any move performed normally on the mat but when executed off the top-or second rope. The term avalanche is especially used in Japan for the same purpose. =Top√©= A top√© (from the original Spanish tope, meaning headbutt), like the plancha, is a move most often performed by jumping from the inside of the ring and out, but instead of going over the top rope, the top√© is performed by leaping forward through the ropes in order to strike the opponent with the head. In Mexico, top√© also refers to any variation of a battering ram.

She served as a New Democratic member of the Manitoba legislature from 1990 until 2003, though she was not called to cabinet when the party formed government in 1999. Cerilli was born in Toronto, raised in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Manitoba (from which she holds a B.P.E. and a Bachelor of Education degree). Before entering political life, she worked as a high school athletics coach, and was a counsellor in the Winnipeg School Division. She also worked at the Unemployed Health Centre of Winnipeg, and was a consultant to Manitoba Employment and Youth Services for three years. Political career Cerilli initially intended to run for the NDP in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Broadway in the 1990 provincial election, but lost the party nomination to Conrad Santos by one vote. She instead ran in the northeast Winnipeg riding of Radisson, where she defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Mike Thompson by almost 1500 votes (incumbent Liberal Allan Patterson finished third). The Progressive Conservatives won the general election, and Cerilli joined nineteen other New Democrats in the official opposition. At the time she was the youngest woman ever elected to the Manitoba legislature. Cerilli was re-elected in the 1995 provincial election, defeating Liberal Art Miki by 4891 votes to 2401. The Progressive Conservatives won the general election again; during her time in opposition, Cerilli served as NDP critic for Housing, Workplace Safety, Health and Youth. She was regarded as one of the more left-wing members of caucus, and was the only Manitoba MLA to support Svend Robinson, rather than Lorne Nystrom, for the leadership of the federal NDP in 1995. The NDP were victorious in the 1999 provincial election, and Cerilli personally defeated Progressive Conservative Henry McDonald by 5198 votes to 3114. She was not appointed to cabinet, but served as legislative assistant to the Minister of Family Services and Housing. In 2003, she supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party. Prior to the 2003 provincial election, she decided to leave her Radisson riding to run for the nomination in Wolseley. She lost to current MLA Rob Altemeyer. She now teaches part-time at the University of Winnipeg, and is operating a community development business. On September 15, 2006, Cerilli officially registered as a candidate for Mayor of the City of Winnipeg in the 2006 municipal election, but lost to incumbent mayor Sam Katz.

The point in code where the state transfer happens is usually given as a parameter to \`COMEFROM\`. Whether the transfer happens before or after the instruction at the specified transfer point depends on the language used. Depending on the language used, multiple \`COMEFROM\`s referencing the same departure point may be invalid, be non- deterministic, be executed in some sort of defined priority, or even induce parallel or otherwise concurrent execution as seen in Threaded Intercal. A simple example of a \\"\`COMEFROM x\`\\" statement is a label \`x\` (which does not need to be physically located anywhere near its corresponding \`COMEFROM\`) that acts as a \\"trap door\\". When code execution reaches the label, control gets passed to the statement following the \`COMEFROM\`. This may also be conditional, passing control only if a condition is satisfied, analogous to a GOTO within an IF statement. The primary difference from GOTO is that GOTO only depends on the local structure of the code, while COMEFROM depends on the global structure ‚Äì a GOTO transfers control when it reaches a line with a GOTO statement, while COMEFROM requires scanning the entire program or scope to see if any COMEFROM statements are in scope for the line, and then verifying if a condition is hit. The effect of this is primarily to make debugging (and understanding the control flow of the program) extremely difficult, since there is no indication near the line or label in question that control will mysteriously jump to another point of the program ‚Äì one must study the entire program to see if any COMEFROM statements reference that line or label. Debugger hooks can be used to implement a COMEFROM statement, as in the humorous Python goto module; see below. This also can be implemented with the gcc feature \\"asm goto\\" as used by the Linux kernel configuration option CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL. A no-op has its location stored, to be replaced by a jump to an executable fragment that at its end returns to the instruction after the no-op. History \`COMEFROM\` was initially seen in lists of joke assembly language instructions (as 'CMFRM'). It was elaborated upon in a Datamation article by R. Lawrence Clark in 1973,. written in response to Edsger Dijkstra's letter Go To Statement Considered Harmful. COMEFROM was eventually implemented in the C-INTERCAL variant of the esoteric programming language INTERCAL along with the even more obscure 'computed \`COMEFROM\`'. There were also Fortran proposals for 'assigned \`COME FROM\`' and a '\`DONT\`' keyword (to complement the existing '\`DO\`' loop). On 1 April 2004, Richie Hindle published an implementation of both \`GOTO\` and \`COMEFROM\` for the Python programming language.. Despite being released on April Fools' Day and not being intended for serious use, the syntax is valid and the implementation fully works. Practical uses =Examples= The following is an example of a program in a hypothetical BASIC dialect with \\"\`COMEFROM\`\\" instead of \\"\`GOTO\`\\". 10 COMEFROM 40 20 INPUT \\"WHAT IS YOUR NAME? \\"; A$ 30 PRINT \\"HELLO, \\"; A$ 40 REM This program (hypothetically) works by asking the user for their name, greeting them with the same name, and continuing all over again. The instruction \\"\`REM\`\\" on line 40 is simply a NOP (in this case, a comment) ‚Äî the \\"\`COMEFROM\`\\" statement on line 10 causes a branch back to that line when execution reaches line 40, regardless of its contents. A fully runnable example in Python with the joke \`goto\` module installed (which uses debugger hooks to control program execution) looks like this: from goto import comefrom, label comefrom .repeat name = raw_input('What is your name? ') if name: print(\\"Hello\\", name) label .repeat print(\\"Goodbye!\\") This is an implementation in Ruby of the Intercal COME FROM statement. $come_from_labels = {} def label(l) if $come_from_labels[l] $come_from_labels[l].call end end def come_from(l) callcc do |block$come_from_labels[l] = block end end = OS/360 Fortran G = The OS/360 Fortran G compiler has a debug packet feature. Its \\"AT\\" statement is similar to COMEFROM in that it hands the control flow over to the debug block. Breakpoints in general are similar.IBM System/360 and System/370 Fortran IV Language, GC28-6515-10, May 1974 * Example 1: the values of SOLON, GFAR, and EWELL are examined as they were at the completion of statement 10.

It was one of the first games to use a light gun as an input device. The game presents players with \\"cardboard cut-outs\\" of gangsters and innocent civilians. The player must shoot the gangs and spare the innocent people. Basis Hogan's Alley was a shooting range on the grounds of the Special Police School at Camp Perry, a training facility for the National Guard of the United States. The Special Police School closed during World War II. In 1987, approximately three years after the release of the video game Hogan's Alley, the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia established a small, simulated city called Hogan's Alley to serve as a venue for training operations. Description A wall round of Hogan's Alley. The middle target is a gangster who must be shot; the lady and policeman to either side must be left alone. The game begins with three cardboard cutouts moving into position against a blank wall and turning to face the player. The cutouts display a mixture of gangsters and innocent/friendly people; the player must react quickly and shoot only the gangsters. In later rounds, the backdrop changes from the blank wall to a city block, with some cutouts already exposed as they emerge into view. The player is confronted with five cutouts in each of these latter rounds. After five rounds apiece in the wall and city block, a bonus round is played. Here, the player has a limited supply of ammunition with which to shoot up to ten tin cans thrown from one side of the screen, trying to bounce them onto ledges at the opposite side for points. After this round, the player returns to the wall rounds and the game continues at an increased speed. Shooting an innocent person, or failing to shoot a gangster, costs the player one life. No lives can be lost in the bonus round. When all lives are lost, the game is over. The game is available on the Nintendo Entertainment System and as a Nintendo VS. System Game Pak, which was installed into VS. System Arcade cabinets, both upright and the \\"Red Tent\\" Cocktail. The controls consist of a single light gun. This was a rather novel input device for a game of its time and added to its appeal. In the United States, Hogan's Alley released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985 as one of the original 18 launch titles for the system. Here, there are three modes: \\"Hogan's Alley A\\" (the blank wall), \\"Hogan's Alley B\\" (the town), and \\"Trick Shot\\" (shooting soda cans to bounce them onto ledges). Ports The game was included as part of an April Fools joke on IGN. The announcement said that the game would be ported to the Nintendo DS as part of the Classic NES Series using the touch screen as a substitute for the light gun. The announcement was only a prank. Parts of the game do, however, appear in form of touch screen-controlled microgames in WarioWare: Touched!, one of which is a longer microgame, and the game soundtrack is also unlockable for listening. While the game never made it to the Wii Virtual Console, it was released to the subsequent Wii U Virtual Console on January 7, 2016 in North America.https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hogans-alley-wii-u/ Reception Computer Gaming World named Hogan's Alley as 1988's Best Target Game for Nintendo, calling it \\"an entertaining variation on the theme\\". Legacy Digital artist Cory Arcangel hacked the Hogan's Alley game to produce \\"I Shot Andy Warhol,\\" an art piece that replaces the game's targets with images of Andy Warhol.

It is distinct from the diffusion of innovations within a specific culture. Examples of diffusion include the spread of the war chariot and iron smelting in ancient times, and the use of automobiles and Western business suits in the 20th century. Types Five major types of cultural diffusion have been defined: * Expansion diffusion: an innovation or idea that develops in a source area and remains strong there, while also spreading outward to other areas. This can include hierarchical, stimulus, and contagious diffusion. * Relocation diffusion: an idea or innovation that migrates into new areas, leaving behind its origin or source of the cultural trait. * Hierarchical diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads by moving from larger to smaller places, often with little regard to the distance between places, and often influenced by social elites. * Contagious diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads based on person-to-person contact within a given population. * Stimulus diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads based on its attachment to another concept. Mechanisms Inter-cultural diffusion can happen in many ways. Migrating populations will carry their culture with them. Ideas can be carried by trans- cultural visitors, such as merchants, explorers, soldiers, diplomats, slaves, and hired artisans. Technology diffusion has often occurred by one society luring skilled scientists or workers by payments or other inducement. Trans- cultural marriages between two neighboring or interspersed cultures have also contributed. Among literate societies, diffusion can occur through letters, books, and, in modern times, through electronic media. There are three categories of diffusion mechanisms: *Direct diffusion occurs when two cultures are very close to each other, resulting in intermarriage, trade, and even warfare. An example of direct diffusion is between the United States and Canada, where the people living on the border of these two countries engage in hockey, which started in Canada, and baseball, which is popular in American culture. *Forced diffusion occurs when one culture subjugates (conquers or enslaves) another culture and forces its own customs on the conquered people. An example would be the forced Christianization of the indigenous peoples of the Americas by the Spanish, French, English and Portuguese, or the forced Islamization of West African peoples by the Fula or of the Nuristanis by the Afghans. *Indirect diffusion happens when traits are passed from one culture through a middleman to another culture, without the first and final cultures being in direct contact. An example could be the presence of Mexican food in Canada, since a large territory (the United States) lies between. Direct diffusion was common in ancient times, when small groups of humans lived in adjoining settlements. Indirect diffusion is common in today's world because of the mass media and invention of the Internet. Also of interest is the work of American historian and critic Daniel J. Boorstin in his book The Discoverers, in which he provides an historical perspective on the role of explorers in the diffusion of innovations between civilizations. Theories The many models that have been proposed for inter-cultural diffusion are: *Migrationism, the spread of cultural ideas by either gradual or sudden population movements *Culture circles diffusionism (Kulturkreise)‚Äîthe theory that cultures originated from a small number of cultures * \\"Kulturkugel\\" (a German compound meaning \\"culture bullet\\", coined by J. P. Mallory), a mechanism suggested by MalloryIn the context of Indo-Aryan migration; Mallory, \\"A European Perspective on Indo-Europeans in Asia\\". In The Bronze Age and Early Iron Age Peoples of Eastern and Central Asia. Ed. Mair. Washington D.C.: Institute for the Study of Man (1998) to model the scale of invasion vs. gradual migration vs. diffusion. According to this model, local continuity of material culture and social organization is stronger than linguistic continuity, so that cultural contact or limited migration regularly leads to linguistic changes without affecting material culture or social organization.The term is a 'half-facetious' mechanical analogy, imagining a \\"bullet\\" of which the tip is material culture and the \\"charge\\" is language and social structure. Upon \\"intrusion\\" into a host culture, migrants will \\"shed\\" their material culture (the \\"tip\\") while possibly still maintaining their \\"charge\\" of language and, to a lesser extent, social customs (viz., the effect is a diaspora culture, which depending on the political situation may either form a substratum or a superstratum within the host culture). * Hyperdiffusionism‚Äîthe theory that all cultures originated from one culture A concept that has often been mentioned in this regard, which may be framed in the evolutionary diffusionism model, is that of \\"an idea whose time has come\\" ‚Äî whereby a new cultural item appears almost simultaneously and independently in several widely separated places, after certain prerequisite items have diffused across the respective communities. This concept was invoked with regard to the independent development of calculus by Newton and Leibnitz, and the inventions of the airplane and of the electronic computer. Hyperdiffusionism Hyperdiffusionists deny that parallel evolution or independent invention took place to any great extent throughout history; they claim that all major inventions and all cultures can be traced back to a single culture.Legend and lore of the Americas before 1492: an encyclopedia of visitors, explorers, and immigrants, Ronald H. Fritze, 1993, p. 70 Early theories of hyperdiffusionism can be traced to ideas about South America being the origin of mankind. Antonio de Le√≥n Pinelo, a Spaniard who settled in Bolivia, claimed in his book Para√≠so en el Nuevo Mundo that the Garden of Eden and the creation of man had occurred in present-day Bolivia and that the rest of the world was populated by migrations from there. Similar ideas were also held by Emeterio Villamil de Rada; in his book La Lengua de Ad√°n he attempted to prove that Aymara was the original language of mankind and that humanity had originated in Sorata in the Bolivian Andes. The first scientific defence of humanity originating in South America came from the Argentine paleontologist Florentino Ameghino in 1880, who published his research in La antig√ºedad del hombre en el Plata.Indians of the Andes: Aymaras and Quechuas, Harold Osborne, 2004, pp. 2‚Äì3 The work of Grafton Elliot Smith fomented a revival of hyperdiffusionism in 1911; he asserted that copper‚Äìproducing knowledge spread from Egypt to the rest of the world along with megalithic culture.The Routledge Dictionary of Anthropologists, G√©rald Gaillard, 2004, p. 48 Smith claimed that all major inventions had been made by the ancient Egyptians and were carried to the rest of the world by migrants and voyagers. His views became known as \\"Egyptocentric-Hyperdiffusionism\\".Megaliths, Myths and Men: An Introduction to Astro-Archaeology, Peter Lancaster Brown, 2000, p. 267 William James Perry elaborated on Smith's hypothesis by using ethnographic data. Another hyperdiffusionist was Lord Raglan; in his book How Came Civilization (1939) he wrote that instead of Egypt all culture and civilization had come from Mesopotamia.Sociocultural Evolution: Calculation and Contingency, Bruce G. Trigger, 1998, p. 101 Hyperdiffusionism after this did not entirely disappear, but it was generally abandoned by mainstream academia. Medieval Europe Diffusion theory has been advanced as an explanation for the \\"European miracle\\", the adoption of technological innovation in medieval Europe which by the 17th century culminated in European technological achievement surpassing the Islamic world and China.Carlo M. Cipolla, Before the Industrial revolution: European Society and Economy 1000‚Äì1700, W.W. Norton and Co., New York (1980) Such technological import to medieval Europe include gunpowder, clock mechanisms, shipbuilding, paper and the windmill, however, in each of these cases Europeans not only adopted the technologies, but improved the manufacturing scale, inherent technology, and applications to a point clearly surpassing the evolution of the original invention in its country of origin. There are also some historians who have questioned whether Europe really owes the development of such inventions as gunpowder, the compass, the windmill or printing to the Chinese or other cultures.Peter Jackson: The Mongols and the West, Pearson Longman 2005, p. 315Donald F. Lach: Asia in the Making of Europe. 3 volumes, Chicago, Illinois, 1965‚Äì93; I:1, pp. 82‚Äì83Robert Bartlett: The Making of Europe. Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950‚Äì1350, Allen Lane, 1993 However historian Peter Frankopan argues that influences, particularly trade, through the middle east & central Asia to China through the silk roads have been overlooked in traditional histories of the \\"rise of the west\\". He argues that the renaissance was funded with trade with the east (due to the demise of Byzantium at the hands of Venice and the 4th Crusade), and that the trade allowed ideas and technology to be shared with Europe. But the constant warfare and rivalry in Europe meant there was extreme evolutionary pressure for developing these ideas for military and economic advantage, and a desperate need to use them in expansion.'The Silk Roads: A New History of the World' Disputes While the concept of diffusion is well accepted in general, conjectures about the existence or the extent of diffusion in some specific contexts have been hotly disputed. An example of such disputes is the proposal by Thor Heyerdahl that similarities between the culture of Polynesia and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Andes are due to diffusion from the latter to the former‚Äîa theory that currently has few supporters among professional anthropologists. Heyerdahl's theory of Polynesian origins has not gained acceptance among anthropologists.Robert C. Suggs The Island Civilizations of Polynesia, New York: New American Library, pp. 212-224Kirch, P. (2000). On the Roads to the Wind: An archaeological history of the Pacific Islands before European contact. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000Physical and cultural evidence had long suggested that Polynesia was settled from west to east, migration having begun from the Asian mainland, not South America. In the late 1990s, genetic testing found that the mitochondrial DNA of the Polynesians is more similar to people from southeast Asia than to people from South America, showing that their ancestors most likely came from Asia.

Biography He was born Roberto Godofredo Christophersen Arlt in Buenos Aires on April 26, 1900. His parents were both immigrants: his father Karl Arlt was a Prussian from Posen (now Pozna≈Ñ in present-day Poland) and his mother was Ekatherine Iobstraibitzer, a native of Trieste and Italian speaking. German was the language commonly used at their home. His relationship with his father was stressful, as Karl Arlt was a very severe and austere man, by Arlt's own account. The memory of his oppressive father would appear in several of his writings. For example, Remo Erdosain (a character at least partially based on Arlt's own life) often recalls his abusive father and how little if any support he would give him. After being expelled from school at the age of eight, Arlt became an autodidact and worked at all sorts of different odd jobs before landing a job on at a local newspaper: as clerk at a bookstore, apprentice to a tinsmith, painter, mechanic, welder, manager in a brick factory, and dock worker. His first novel, El juguete rabioso (1926) (\\"Mad Toy\\"), was the semi-autobiographical story of Silvio, a dropout who goes through a series of adventures trying to be \\"somebody.\\" Narrated by Silvio's older self, the novel reflects the energy and chaos of the early 20th century in Buenos Aires. The narrator's literary and sometimes poetic language contrasts sharply with the street-level slang of Mad Toy's many colorful characters. Arlt's second novel, the popular Los siete locos (The Seven Madmen) was rough, brutal, colloquial and surreal, a complete break from the polite, middle-class literature more typical of Argentine literature. Los lanzallamas (The Flame-Throwers) was the sequel, and these two novels together are thought by many to be his greatest work. What followed were a series of short stories and plays in which Arlt pursued his vision of bizarre, half-mad, alienated characters pursuing insane quests in a landscape of urban chaos. In 1932 he published El amor brujo. During his lifetime, however, Arlt was best known for his \\"Aguafuertes\\" (\\"Etchings\\"), the result of his contributions as a columnist - between 1928 and 1942 - to the Buenos Aires daily \\"El Mundo\\". Arlt used these columns to comment, in his characteristically forthright and unpretentious style, on the peculiarities, hypocrisies, strangeness and beauty of everyday life in Argentina's capital. These articles included occasional expos√©s of public institutions, such as the juvenile justice system (\\"Escuela primaria de delincuencia\\", 26‚Äì29 September 1932) or the Public Health System. Some of the \\"Aguafuertes\\" were collected in two volumes under the titles Secretos femeninos. Aguafuertes in√©ditas and Tratado de delincuencia. Aguafuertes in√©ditas which were edited by Sergio Olgu√≠n and published by Ediciones 12 and P√°gina/12 in 1996. Between March and May 1930, Arlt wrote a series of \\"Aguafuertes\\" as a correspondent to \\"El Mundo\\" in Rio de Janeiro. In 1935 he spent nearly a year writing as he traveled throughout Spain and North Africa, on the eve of the Spanish Civil War. At the time of his death, Arlt was hoping to be sent to the United States as a correspondent. Worn out and exhausted after a lifetime of hardships, he died from a stroke on July 26, 1942. His coffin was lowered from his apartment by an operated crane, an ironic end, considering his bizarre stories. Arlt has been massively influential on Latin American literature, including the 1960s \\"Boom\\" generation of writers such as Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. \\"Let's say, modestly, that Arlt is Jesus Christ,\\" propounded Roberto Bola√±o. Analogues in English literature are those who avoid literary 'respectability' by writing about the poor, the criminal and the mad: writers like William Burroughs, Iceberg Slim, and Irvine Welsh. Arlt, however, predated all of them. He is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern Argentine novel; among those contemporary writers who claim to have been influenced by Arlt are Abelardo Castillo, Ricardo Piglia and C√©sar Aira. At least two Argentine movies were based on his novels, Los siete locos (1974) and El juguete rabioso (1985). Peter Damian Bellis, editor of the independent press River Boat Books of Minneapolis, became resolved to make Los siete locos and Los lanzallamas available together in English translation. Although a plan to publish the two closely linked novels in the same volume proved unfeasible, The Seven Madmen and The Flamethrowers, respectively translated by Naomi Lindstrom and Larry Riley, appeared simultaneously in July 2018.

The tale follows the theme of the doppelg√§nger and is written in a style based on rationality. It also appeared in the 1840 collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque, and has been adapted several times. Plot summary The story follows a man of \\"a noble descent\\" who calls himself William Wilson because, although denouncing his profligate past, he does not accept full blame for his actions, saying that \\"man was never thus ... tempted before\\". After several paragraphs, the narration then segues into a description of Wilson's boyhood, which is spent in a school \\"in a misty-looking village of England\\". Wilson and his \\"double\\" at the carnival in an illustration by Byam Shaw for a London edition dated 1909 William meets another boy in his school who has the same name and roughly the same appearance, and who was even born on the same date (January 19, Poe's own birthday). William's name (he asserts that his actual name is only similar to \\"William Wilson\\") embarrasses him because it sounds \\"plebeian\\" or common, and he is irked that he must hear the name twice as much on account of the other William. The boy also dresses like William, walks like him, but can only speak in a whisper. He begins to give advice to William of an unspecified nature, which he refuses to obey, resenting the boy's \\"arrogance\\". One night he steals into the other William's bedroom and recoils in horror at the boy's face‚Äîwhich now resembles his own. William then immediately leaves the academy and, in the same week, the other boy follows suit. William eventually attends Eton and Oxford, gradually becoming more debauched and performing what he terms \\"mischief\\". For example, he steals from a man by cheating at cards. The other William appears, his face covered, and whispers a few words sufficient to alert others to William's behavior, and then leaves with no others seeing his face. William is haunted by his double in subsequent years, who thwarts plans described by William as driven by ambition, anger and lust. In one caper, he attempts to seduce a married woman at Carnival in Rome, but the other William stops him. The enraged protagonist drags his \\"unresisting\\" double‚Äîwho wears identical clothes‚Äî into an antechamber, and, after a brief sword fight in which the double participates only reluctantly, stabs him fatally. After William does this, a large mirror suddenly seems to appear. Reflected at him, he sees \\"mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood\\": apparently the dead double, \\"but he spoke no longer in a whisper\\". The narrator feels as if he is pronouncing the words: \\"In me didst thou exist‚Äîand in my death, see ... how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.\\"  Background  Stoke Newington retains two parish churches: St Mary's Old Church (left) and New Church (right) The setting of \\"William Wilson\\" is semi-autobiographical and relates to Poe's residence in England as a boy. The \\"misty-looking village of England\\" of the story is Stoke Newington, now a suburb of north London. The school is based on the Manor House School in Stoke Newington which Poe attended from 1817 to 1820. Poe's headmaster there, the Reverend John Bransby, shares the same name as the headmaster in the story, though, in the latter, he acquires the dignity of being a \\"Doctor\\".Quinn, Arthur Hobson Quinn. Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998: 75. This school has since been demolished. The church mentioned in the story is based on St Mary's \\"Old\\" Church, the original parish church of Stoke Newington. This building is still extant. In Poe's story the church is described to have a Gothic spire. The spire, however, was only added to the church in 1829 some nine years after Poe had left the school. Additionally, Poe acknowledged that the idea of a story about the irritation one feels by meeting someone with the same name, thereby ruining a feeling of uniqueness, was inspired by Washington Irving's \\"An Unwritten Drama of Lord Byron\\". At the end of Irving's tale, the main character kills his double with his sword, only to see his own face behind the mask.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York City: Harper Perennial, 1991: 149‚Äì150. Analysis \\"William Wilson\\" clearly explores the theme of the double. This second self haunts the protagonist and leads him to insanity and also represents his own insanity.Meyers, Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992: 287. According to Poe biographer, Arthur Hobson Quinn, the second self represents the conscience.Quinn, Arthur Hobson Quinn. Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998: 286‚Äì287. This division of the self is reinforced by the narrator's admission that \\"William Wilson\\" is actually a pseudonym. The name itself is an interesting choice: \\"son\\" of \\"will\\". In other words, William Wilson has willed himself into being along with the double which shares that name.Hoffman, Daniel. Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1972. p. 209. Poe wrote the story very carefully and with subtlety. Sentences are balanced, with very few adjectives, and there is little concrete imagery beyond the description of Wilson's school. Pacing is purposely set as leisurely and measured using a formal style and longer sentences. Rather than creating a poetic effect or mood, as Poe recommends in \\"The Philosophy of Composition\\", Poe is creating a tale based on rationality and logic.Stauffer, Donald Barlow. \\"Style and Meaning in 'Ligeia' and 'William Wilson'\\", from Twentieth Century Interpretations of Poe's Tales, edited by William L. Howarth. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc., 1971: 82. Publication history \\"William Wilson\\" was published in the October 1839 issue of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine, though it appeared earlier that year in The Gift: A Christmas and New Year's Present dated for 1840.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 256. The tale was later translated into French in December 1844, printed in the Paris newspaper La Quotidienne in two installments. This was the first translation of Poe's work to a language other than English and marked Poe's introduction to France.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York City: Harper Perennial, 1991: 233. Critical reception Wilson confronts his \\"double\\" in an illustration by Arthur Rackham 1935 When Poe wrote to Washington Irving asking for a word of endorsement, he specifically requested a response to \\"William Wilson\\", calling it \\"my best effort\\".Neimeyer, Mark. \\"Poe and Popular Culture\\", collected in The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe. Cambridge University Press, 2002: 207. Irving responded, \\"It is managed in a highly picturesque Style and the Singular and Mysterious interest is well sustained throughout\\".Jones, Brian Jay. Washington Irving: An American Original. New York: Arcade Publishing, 2008: 334. Thomas Mann said of Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Double: A Petersburg Poem, which explores a similar doppelg√§nger theme, \\"by no means improved on Edgar Allan Poe's 'William Wilson,' a tale that deals with the same old romantic motif in a way far more profound on the moral side and more successfully resolving the critical [theme] in the poetic\\". In Poe's review of Nathaniel Hawthorne's Twice-Told Tales, Poe noted that the short story \\"Howe's Masquerade\\" was similar to \\"William Wilson\\". As he wrote, \\"not only are the two general conceptions identical but there are various points of similarity\\".Poe, Edgar Allan, \\"Twice-Told Tales: A Review\\", Graham's Magazine, May 1842, Adaptations In 1913, \\"William Wilson\\" was freely adapted into The Student of Prague, a German film directed by Stellan Rye and Paul Wegener and starring Wegener. A 1926 version was also made in Germany and directed by Henrik Galeen and starred Conrad Veidt. A third German adaptation, made in 1935, was directed by Arthur Robison and starred Anton Walbrook. In 1943, \\"William Wilson\\" was adapted as a radio play for The Weird Circle on the Mutual Broadcasting System. A French-Italian collaboration came out in 1968 called Spirits of the Dead or Histoires extraordinaires. The film is composed of three vignettes, directed by Roger Vadim, Louis Malle and Federico Fellini and starring Alain Delon and Brigitte Bardot.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 256‚Äì257. The other two segments adapt Poe's \\"Metzengerstein\\" and \\"Never Bet the Devil Your Head\\". It would also form the basis for The Smithereens' song of the same name, from their 1989 album 11. In 1968, Editora Taika in Brazil published a comic adaptation in Album Classicos De Terror #6. Art was by Osvaldo Talo. It was reprinted in Classicos De Terror (2nd series) #5 in June 1973. In 1974, Skywald published a comic adaptation in Nightmare #19 (June 1974), adapted by Al Hewetson, with art by Alfonso Font. This was reprinted by Mehmet K. Benli Turkey in Vampirella #3 (October 25, 1976) and Vampirella # (1977); and by Eternity Comics in Edgar Allan Poe: The Tell-Tale Heart and Other Stories #1 (June 1988). In 1976 the BBC anthology series Centre Play aired an adaptation written by Hugh Whitemore featuring Norman Eshley as the title character along with Stephen Murray, Anthony Daniels, and Robert Tayman. In 1976, British filmmaker Peter de Rome made a loose adaptation of the story with his second and final feature, The Destroying Angel, a hybrid of horror movie and gay porn film, produced by New York studio Hand in Hand Films. The film is about a man on sabbatical from seminary who experiences inner conflict between his sexual desires and his call to the cloth, which is made manifest through the appearances of his doppelganger. The stabbing scene in Poe's story is the one moment that is directly paralleled in the film. Peter de Rome said he was inspired to make this film when he saw a portrait of Poe and realized that Poe was, essentially, visually his own doppelganger. In 1979, Ediciones De La Urraca in Argentina published a comic adaptation in El Pendulo #2 (October 1979). Adaptation was by Guillermo Saccomanno, art was by Alberto Breccia. This was reprinted by Les Humanoides Associes in France in Le Coeur Revelator (1992 and September 1995) and by Doedyeeditores in Argentina in El Gato Negro Y Outras Historias (2011). In 1979, Bloch Editores S.A. in Brazil published a comic adaptation in Aventuras Macabras #12 (1979). The adaptation and art were by Jose Menezes. In 1999, Spanish director Jorge Dayas released a 35 mm animated short film, awarded in Animadrid 2000 and Malaga Film Festival. References in other works There are strains of the story of \\"William Wilson\\" in Andrew Taylor's \\"The American Boy\\", in which Edgar Allan Poe himself is featured as a character. Nabokov's Lolita has been cited as at least a parody of the story. In Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 film Pierrot Le Fou, the main character, Ferdinand, summarizes the story as an example of things that he and the other protagonist, Marianne, could perform to earn money.

Genetic matrilineal distances between European Neolithic Linear Pottery Culture populations (5,500‚Äì4,900 calibrated BC) and modern Western Eurasian populations. Demic diffusion, as opposed to trans-cultural diffusion, is a demographic term referring to a migratory model, developed by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, of population diffusion into and across an area that had been previously uninhabited by that group, possibly, but not necessarily, displacing, replacing, or intermixing with an existing population (such as has been suggested for the spread of agriculture across Neolithic Europe and several other Landnahme events). In its original formulation, the demic diffusion model includes three phases: (1) population growth, prompted by new available resources as in the case of early farmers, and/or other technological developments; (2) a dispersal into regions with lower population density; (3) a limited initial admixture with the people encountered in the process. Evidence Theoretical work by Cavalli-Sforza showed that if admixture between expanding farmers and previously resident groups of hunters and gatherers is not immediate, the process would result in the establishment of broad genetic gradients. Because broad gradients, spanning much of Europe from southeast to northwest, were identified in empirical genetic studies by Cavalli-Sforza, Robert R. Sokal, Guido Barbujani, Loun√®s Chikhi and others, it seemed likely that the spread of agriculture into Europe occurred by the expansion and spread of agriculturists, possibly originating in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East region.Chicki, L; Nichols, RA; Barbujani, G; Beaumont, MA. 2002.

The distinct identity and fragmentation of the Balkans owes much to its common and often turbulent history regarding centuries of Ottoman conquest and to its very mountainous geography. Prehistory =Neolithic= A burial at Varna, Bulgaria, with some of the world's oldest gold jewelry. Archaeologists have identified several early culture-complexes, including the Cucuteni culture (4500 to 3500 BC), Starcevo culture (6500 to 4000 BC), Vinƒça culture (5000 to 3000 BC), Linear pottery culture (5500 to 4500 BC), and Ezero culture (3300‚Äî2700 BC). The Eneolithic Varna culture in Bulgaria (4600‚Äì4200 BC radiocarbon dating) produced the world's earliest known gold treasure and had sophisticated beliefs about afterlife. A notable set of artifacts are the TƒÉrtƒÉria tablets found in Romania, which appear to be inscribed with proto-writing. The Butmir Culture (2600 to 2400 BC), found on the outskirts of present-day Sarajevo, developed unique ceramics, and was likely overrun by the proto-Illyrians in the Bronze Age. The \\"Kurgan hypothesis\\" of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) origins assumes gradual expansion of the \\"Kurgan culture\\", around 5000 BC, until it encompassed the entire pontic steppe.

These three major tribal groups spoke Paleo-Balkan languages, Indo-European languages. The Phrygians seem to have settled in the southern Balkans at first, centuries later continuing their migration to settle in Asia Minor, now extinct as a separate group and language. Antiquity = Iron Age = After the period that followed the arrival of the Dorians, known as the Greek Dark Ages or the Geometric Period, the classical Greek culture developed in the southern Balkan peninsula, the Aegean islands and the western Asia Minor Greek colonies starting around the 9th or 8th century BC and peaking with the democracy that developed in 6th and 5th century BC Athens. Later, Hellenistic culture spread throughout the empire created by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE. The Greeks were the first to establish a system of trade routes in the Balkans, and in order to facilitate trade with the natives, between 700 BC and 300 BC they founded a number of colonies on the Black Sea (Pontus Euxinus) coast, Asia Minor, Dalmatia, Southern Italy (Magna Graecia) etc. By the end of the 4th century BC Greek language and culture were dominant not only in the Balkans but also around the whole Eastern Mediterranean. In the late 6th century BC, the Persians invaded the Balkans, and then proceed to the fertile areas of Europe. Parts of the Balkans and more northern areas were ruled by the Achaemenid Persians for some time, including Thrace, Paeonia, Macedon, and most Black Sea coastal regions of Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Russia.The Oxford Classical Dictionary by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth,,\\"page 1515,\\"The Thracians were subdued by the Persians by 516\\"Joseph Roisman,Ian Worthington A Companion to Ancient Macedonia pp 342‚Äì345 John Wiley & Sons, 7 jul. 2011 However, the outcome of the Greco-Persian Wars resulted in the Achaemenids being forced to withdraw from most of their European territories. The Thracian Odrysian empire - the Odrysian kingdom, was the most important Daco-Thracian state union, and probably was founded in the 470s BC, after the Persian defeat in Greece, had its capital at Seuthopolis, near Kazanlak, Stara Zagora Province, in central Bulgaria. Other tribal unions existed in Dacia at least as early as the beginning of the 2nd century BC under King Oroles. The Illyrian tribes were situated in the area corresponding to today's Adriatic coast. The name Illyrii was originally used to refer to a people occupying an area centered on Lake Skadar, situated between Albania and Montenegro (Illyrians proper). However, the term was subsequently used by the Greeks and Romans as a generic name for the different peoples within a well defined but much greater area.The Illyrians. John Wilkes In the same way, the territory to the north of the kingdom of Macedon was occupied by the Paeonians, who were also ruled by kings. =Achaemenid Persian Empire (6th to 5th century BC)= Around 513 BC, as part of the military incursions ordered by Darius I, a huge Achaemenid army invaded the Balkans and tried to defeat the Western Scythians roaming to the north of the Danube river. Several Thracian peoples, and nearly all of the other European regions bordering the Black Sea (including parts of the modern-day Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Russia), were conquered by the Achaemenid army before it returned to Asia Minor. Darius's highly regarded commander Megabazus was responsible to fulfill the conquers in the Balkans. The Achaemenid troops conquered Thrace, the coastal Greek cities, and the Paeonians.Timothy Howe, Jeanne Reames. Macedonian Legacies: Studies in Ancient Macedonian History and Culture in Honor of Eugene N. Borza (original from the Indiana University) Regina Books, 2008 p 239 Eventually, in about 512‚Äì511 BC, the Macedonian king Amyntas I accepted the Achaemenid domination and surrendered his country as a vassal state to the Achaemenid Persia. The multi- ethnic Achaemenid army possessed many soldiers from the Balkans. Moreover, many of the Macedonian and Persian elite intermarried. For instance, Megabazus' own son, Bubares, married Amyntas' daughter, Gygaea; and that supposedly ensured good relations between the Macedonian and Achaemenid rulers. Following the Ionian Revolt the Persian authority in the Balkans was restored by Mardonius in 492, which not only included the re-subjugation of Thrace, but also the full subordinate inclusion of Macedon into the Persian Empire.Herodotus VI, 44 The Persian invasion led indirectly to Macedonia's rise in power and Persia had some common interests in the Balkans; with Persian aid, the Macedonians stood to gain much at the expense of some Balkan tribes such as the Paeonians and Greeks. All in all, the Macedonians were \\"willing and useful Persian allies.\\"Joseph Roisman,Ian Worthington A Companion to Ancient Macedonia p. 344 John Wiley & Sons, 7 jul. 2011 Macedonian soldiers fought against Athens and Sparta in Xerxes' army. Although Persian rule in the Balkans was overthrown following the failure of Xerxes' invasion, the Macedonians and Thracians borrowed heavily from the Achaemenid Persians their tradition in culture and economy in the 5th- to mid-4th centuries. Some artificats, excavated at Sindos and Vergina maybe be considered as influenced by Asian practices, or even imported from Persia in the late sixth and early fifth centuries. =Pre-Roman states (4th to 1st centuries BC)= Bardylis, a Dardanian chieftain, created a kingdom which turned Illyria into a formidable local power in the 4th century BC. The main cities of this kingdom were Scodra (present-day Shkodra, Albania) and Rhizon (present-day Risan, Montenegro). In 359 BC, King Perdiccas III of Macedon was killed by attacking Illyrians. But in 358 BC, Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, defeated the Illyrians and assumed control of their territory as far as Lake Ohrid (present-day North Macedonia). Alexander himself routed the forces of the Illyrian chieftain Cleitus in 335 BC, and Illyrian tribal leaders and soldiers accompanied Alexander on his conquest of Persia. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, the Greek states started fighting among themselves again, while up north independent Illyrian polities arose again. In 312 BC, King Glaukias seized Epidamnus. By the end of the 3rd century BC, an Illyrian kingdom based in Scodra controlled parts of northern Albania, and littoral Montenegro. Under Queen Teuta, Illyrians attacked Roman merchant vessels plying the Adriatic Sea and gave Rome an excuse to invade the Balkans. In the Illyrian Wars of 229 BC and 219 BC, Rome overran the Illyrian settlements in the Neretva river valley and suppressed the piracy that had made the Adriatic unsafe. In 180 BC, the Dalmatians declared themselves independent of the Illyrian king Gentius, who kept his capital at Scodra. The Romans defeated Gentius, the last king of Illyria, at Scodra in 168 BC and captured him, bringing him to Rome in 165 BC. Four client-republics were set up, which were in fact ruled by Rome. Later, the region was directly governed by Rome and organized as a province, with Scodra as its capital. Also, in 168 BC, by taking advantage of the constant Greek civil wars, the Romans defeated Perseus, the last King of Macedonia and with their allies in southern Greece, they became overlords of the region. The territories were split to Macedonia, Achaia and Epirus. Roman period The Balkan provinces in the Western Roman Empire Starting in the 2nd century BC the rising Roman Republic began annexing the Balkan area, transforming it into one of the Empire's most prosperous and stable regions. To this day, the Roman legacy is clearly visible in the numerous monuments and artifacts scattered throughout the Balkans, and most importantly in the Latin-based languages used by almost 25 million people in the area (the Balkan Romance languages). However, the Roman influence failed to dissolve Greek culture, which maintained a predominant status in the Eastern half of the Empire, and continued to be strong in the southern half of the Balkans. Beginning in the 3rd century AD, Rome's frontiers in the Balkans were weakened because of internal political and economic disorders. During this time, the Balkans, especially Illyricum, grew to greater importance. It became one of the Empire's four prefectures, and many warriors, administrators and emperors arose from the region. Many rulers built their residences in the region.The Serbs, Chapter 1 -Ancient Heritage, S M Cirkovic Though the situation had stabilized temporarily by the time of Constantine, waves of non-Roman peoples, most prominently the Thervings, Greuthungs and Huns, began to cross into the territory, first (in the case of the Thervingi) as refugees with imperial permission to take shelter from their foes the Huns, then later as invaders. Turning on their hosts after decades of servitude and simmering hostility, Thervingi under Fritigern and later Visigoths under Alaric I eventually conquered and laid waste the entire Balkan region before moving westward to invade Italy itself. By the end of the Empire the region had become a conduit for invaders to move westward, as well as the scene of treaties and complex political maneuvers by Romans, Goths and Huns, all seeking the best advantage for their peoples amid the shifting and disorderly final decades of Roman imperial power. =Rise of Christianity= Christianity first came to the area when Saint Paul and some of his followers traveled in the Balkans passing through Thracian, Illyrian and Greek populated areas. He spread Christianity to the Greeks at Beroia, Thessaloniki, Athens, Corinth and Dyrrachium. Saint Andrew also worked among the Thracians, Dacians and Scythians, and had preached in Dobruja and Pontus Euxinus. In 46 AD, this territory was conquered by the Romans and annexed to Moesia. In 106 AD the emperor Trajan invaded Dacia. Subsequently, Christian colonists, soldiers and slaves came to Dacia and spread Christianity. St. Sofia Church, Sofia, Bulgaria. The Edict of Serdica, also called Edict of Toleration by Emperor Galerius, was issued in 311 in Serdica (today Sofia, Bulgaria) by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity in the East. In the 3rd century the number of Christians grew. When Emperor Constantine of Rome issued the Edict of Milan in 313, thus ending all Roman-sponsored persecution of Christianity, the area became a haven for Christians. Just twelve years later in 325, Constantine assembled the First Council of Nicaea. In 391, Theodosius I made Christianity the official religion of Rome. The East-West Schism, known also as the Great Schism (though this latter term sometimes refers to the later Western Schism), was the event that divided Christianity into Western Catholicism and Greek Eastern Orthodoxy, following the dividing line of the Empire in Western Latin-speaking and Eastern Greek- speaking parts. Though normally dated to 1054, when Pope Leo IX and Patriarch of Constantinople Michael I Cerularius excommunicated each other, the East- West Schism was actually the result of an extended period of estrangement between the two Churches. The primary claimed causes of the Schism were disputes over papal authority‚Äîthe Pope claimed he held authority over the four Eastern patriarchs, while the patriarchs claimed that the Pope was merely a first among equals‚Äîand over the insertion of the filioque clause into the Nicene Creed. Most serious (and real) cause of course, was the competition for power between the old and the new capitals of the Roman Empire (Rome and Constantinople). There were other, less significant catalysts for the Schism, including variance over liturgical practices and conflicting claims of jurisdiction. Early Middle Ages = Eastern Roman Empire = The Jireƒçek Line separating zones of Greek and Latin influence prior to the Slavic invasions. The Byzantine Empire was the Greek-speaking, Eastern Roman Empire during the Middle Ages, centered at its capital in Constantinople. During most of its history it controlled provinces in the Balkans and Asia Minor. The Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian for a time retook and restored much of the territory once held by the unified Roman Empire, from Spain and Italy, to Anatolia. Unlike the Western Roman Empire, which met a famous if rather ill- defined death in the year 476 AD, the Eastern Roman Empire came to a much less famous but far more definitive conclusion at the hands of Mehmet II and the Ottoman Empire in the year 1453. Its expert military and diplomatic power ensured inadvertently that Western Europe remained safe from many of the more devastating invasions from eastern peoples, at a time when the still new and fragile Western Christian kingdoms might have had difficulty containing it. The magnitude of influence and contribution the Byzantine Empire made to Europe and Christendom has only begun to be recognised recently. The Emperor Justinian I's formation of a new code of law, the Corpus Juris Civilis, served as a basis of subsequent development of legal codes. Byzantium played an important role in the transmission of classical knowledge to the Islamic world and to Renaissance Italy. Its rich historiographical tradition preserved ancient knowledge upon which splendid art, architecture, literature and technological achievements were built. This is embodied in the Byzantine version of Christianity, which spread Orthodoxy and eventually led to the creation of the so-called \\"Byzantine commonwealth\\" (a term coined by 20th- century historians) throughout Eastern Europe. Early Byzantine missionary work spread Orthodox Christianity to various Slavic peoples, amongst whom it still is a predominant religion. Jewish communities were also spread through the Balkans at this time, while the Jews were primarily Romaniotes.Mapping the Jewish communities of the Byzantine EmpireLaurentiu, R. At Europe's Borders: Medieval Towns in the Romanian Principalities, pp. 109, 219. 2010 In a sense of a Greek-influenced \\"Byzantine commonwealth\\", the Greek Christian culture and also the Romaniote culture have influenced the emerging cultures both the Christian and the Jewish cultures of the Balkans and of Eastern Europe.R. Bonfil et al., Jews in Byzantium: Dialectics of Minority and Majority Cultures, p. 127-ff. 2011 Roman Empire and Barbarian confederacies in the Balkans, c. 200 AD Throughout its history, its borders were ever fluctuating, often involved in multi-sided conflicts with not only the Arabs, Persians and Turks of the east, but also with its Christian neighbours- the Bulgarians, Serbs, Normans and the Crusaders, which all at one time or another conquered large amounts of its territory. By the end, the empire consisted of nothing but Constantinople and small holdings in mainland Greece, with all other territories in both the Balkans and Asia Minor gone. The conclusion was reached in 1453, when the city was successfully besieged by Mehmet II, bringing the Second Rome to an end. =Barbarian incursions= Coinciding with the decline of the Roman Empire, many \\"barbarian\\" tribes passed through the Balkans, most of whom did not leave any lasting state. During these \\"Dark Ages\\", Eastern Europe, like Western Europe, regressed culturally and economically, although enclaves of prosperity and culture persisted along the coastal towns of the Adriatic and the major Greek cities in the south. As the Byzantine Empire withdrew its borders more and more, in an attempt to consolidate its waning power, vast areas were de-urbanised, roads abandoned and native populations may have withdrawn to isolated areas such as mountains and forests. The first such barbarian tribe to enter the Balkans were the Goths. From northern East Germany, via Scythia, they pushed southwards into the Roman Balkans following the threat of the Huns. These Goths were eventually granted lands inside the Byzantine realm (south of the Danube), as foederati (allies). However, after a period of famine, the proto-Visigoths rebelled and defeated the emperor in 378. The Visigoths subsequently sacked Rome in 410, and in an attempt to deal with them, they were granted lands in France. The Huns, a confederation of a Turkic-Uralic ruling core that subsequently incorporated various Germanic, Sarmatian and Slavic tribes, moved west into Europe entering Pannonia in 400‚Äì410 AD. The Huns are supposed to have triggered the great German migrations into western Europe. From their base, the Huns subdued many people and carved out a sphere of terror extending from Germany and the Baltic to the Black Sea. With the death of Attila the Hun in 454 AD, succession struggles led to the rapid collapse of Hun prestige and subsequent disappearance from Europe. In the meantime, the Ostrogoths freed themselves from Hunnish domination in 454 AD and became foedorati as well. The Ostrogoths too migrated westwards, commissioned by the Byzantines, and established a state in Italy. In the second half of the 5th- and first of the 6th century, new Germanic barbarian tribes entered the Balkans. The Gepids, having lived in Dacia in the 3rd century with the Goths, settled Pannonia and eventually conquered Singidunum (Belgrade) and Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica), establishing a short-lived kingdom in the 6th century. The Lombards entered Pannonia in 550s, defeated the Gepids and absorbed them. In 569 they moved into northern Italy, establishing their own kingdom at the expense of the Ostrogoths. Hunnic Empire. The Slavs, known as the Sklavenoi, migrated in successive waves. Small numbers might have moved down as early as the 3rd century however the bulk of migration did not occur until the 6th century. The Slavs migrated from Central Europe and Eastern Europe and eventually became known as South Slavs. Most still remained subjects of the Roman Empire. The northern Balkans in the 6th century. The Avars were a Turkic group (or possibly MongolDavid Christian-A history of Russia, Central Asia, and Mongolia, p.280), possibly with a ruling core derived from the Rouran that escaped the G√∂kt√ºrks. They entered Central Europe in the 7th century AD, forcing the Lombards to flee to Italy. They continuously raided the Balkans, contributing to the general decline of the area that had begun centuries earlier. After their unsuccessful siege on Constantinople in 626, they limited themselves to Central Europe. They ruled over the Western Slavs that had already inhabited the region. By the 10th century, the Avar confederacy collapsed due to internal conflicts, Frankish and Slavic attacks. The remnant Avars were subsequently absorbed by the Slavs and Magyars. The Bulgars, Turkic people of Central Asia, first appeared in a wave commenced with the arrival of Asparuh's Bulgars. Asparuh was one of Kubrat's, the Great Khan, successors. They had occupied the fertile plains of the Ukraine for several centuries until the Khazars swept their confederation in the 660s and triggered their further migration. One part of them ‚Äî under the leadership of Asparuh ‚Äî headed southwest and settled in the 670s in present-day Bessarabia. In 680 AD they invaded Moesia and Dobrudja and formed a confederation with the local Slavic tribes who had migrated there a century earlier. After suffering a defeat at the hands of Bulgars and Slavs, the Byzantine Empire recognised the sovereignty of Asparuh's Khanate in a subsequent treaty signed in 681 AD. The same year is usually regarded as the year of the establishment of Bulgaria (see History of Bulgaria). A smaller group of Bulgars under Khan Kouber settled almost simultaneously in the Pelagonian plain in western Macedonia after spending some time in Panonia. Some Bulgars actually entered Europe earlier with the Huns. After the disintegration of the Hunnic Empire the Bulgars dispersed mostly to eastern Europe. The Magyars, led by √Årp√°d, were the leading clan in a ten tribe confederacy. They entered Europe in the 10th century AD, settling in Pannonia. There they encountered a predominantly Slavic populace and Avar remnants. The Magyars were a Uralic people, originating from west of the Ural Mountains. They learned the art of horseback warfare from Turkic people. They then migrated further west around 400AD, settling in the Don-Dnieper area. Here they were subjects of the Khazar Khaganate. They were neighboured by the Bulgars and Alans. They sided with 3 rebel Khazar tribes against the ruling factions. Their loss in this civil war, and ongoing battles with the Pechenegs, was probably the catalyst for them to move further west into Europe. The local Romans and Romanized remnants of the Iron Age populace of the Balkans began their assimilation into mainly the Slavs and Greeks, however, notable Latin-speaking communities are known to have survived. In literature, these Romance-speakers are known as \\"Vlachs\\". In Dacia, Roman colonists and Romanized Dacians retreated in the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania after the Roman withdrawal. Archaeological evidence indicate a Romanized population in Transylvania by at least the 8th century. By the 7th and 8th centuries, the Roman Empire existed only south of the Danube River in the form of the Byzantine Empire, with its capital at Constantinople. In this ethnically diverse closing area of the Roman Empire, Vlachs were recognized as those who spoke Latin, the official language of the Byzantine Empire used only in official documents, until the 6th century when it was changed to the more popular Greek. These original Vlachs probably consisted of a variety of ethnic groups (most notably Thracians, Dacians, Illyrians) who shared the commonality of having been assimilated in language and culture of the Roman Empire with the Roman colonists settled in their areas. Anna Comnene relates in Alexiade about Dacians (instead of Vlachs) from Balkans and from the North side of Danube and they were identified as Romanians.Elian, Alexandru and Tanasoca, Nicolae-Serban (1975). Fontes Historiae Daco-Romanae, Saec. XI-XIV, Editura Academiei RSR, Bucuresti,1975, note 91 on p.117. Romance-speaking populations survived on the Adriatic, and the Albanians are believed by some to be descending from partially Romanized Illyrians. =First Bulgarian Empire= The First Bulgarian Empire's greatest territorial extent during the reign of Simeon I. In the 7th century the Bulgaria was established by Khan Asparuh. It greatly increased in strength in the coming centuries stretching from Dnieper to Budapest and the Mediterranean. Bulgaria dominated the Balkans for the next four centuries and was instrumental in the adoption of Christianity in the region and among other Slavs. Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I the Great, following the cultural and political course of his father Boris I, ordered the creation of the Bulgarian Alphabet, which was later spread by missionaries to the north reaching modern Russia. High Middle Ages =Republic of Venice= The Uprising of Asen and Peter was a revolt of Bulgarians and VlachsThe Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest, John Van Antwerp Fine, University of Michigan Press, 1994, , p. 12History of the Byzantine Empire, 324-1453, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vasil πev, Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1952, , p. 442. living in Moesia and the Balkan Mountains, then the theme of Paristrion of the Byzantine Empire, caused by a tax increase. It began on 26 October 1185, the feast day of St. Demetrius of Thessaloniki, and ended with the restoration of Bulgaria with the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire, ruled by the Asen dynasty. In building its maritime commercial empire, the Republic of Venice dominated the trade in salt,Richard Cowen, The importance of salt acquired control of most of the islands in the Aegean, including Cyprus and Crete, and became a major \\"power\\" in the Near East and in all the Balkans. Venice seized a number of locations on the eastern shores of the Adriatic sea before 1200, partly for purely commercial reasons, but also because pirates based there were a menace to its trade. The Doge since that time bore the titles of Duke of Dalmatia and Duke of Istria. Venice became a fully imperial power following the Venetian-financed Fourth Crusade, which in 1203 captured and in 1204 sacked and conquered Constantinople, dividing the Byzantine Empire into several smaller states and established the Latin Empire. Venice subsequently carved out a sphere of influence in the Aegean known as the Duchy of the Archipelago, and also gained control of the island of Crete. Weakened by constant warfare with Bulgaria and the unconquered sections of the empire, the Latin Empire eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century. Late Middle Ages The Balkans in 1355. From the 14th century, Venice controlled most of the maritime commerce of the Balkans with important colonial possessions on the Adriatic and Aegean coasts. Venice's long decline started in the 15th century, when it first made an unsuccessful attempt to hold Thessalonica against the Ottomans (1423‚Äì1430). She also sent ships to help defend Constantinople against the besieging Turks (1453). After the city fell to Sultan Mehmet II, he declared war on Venice. The war lasted thirty years and cost Venice many of the eastern Mediterranean possessions. Slowly the Republic of Venice lost nearly all possessions in the Balkans, maintaining in the 18th century only the Adriatic areas of Istria, Dalmatia and Albania Veneta. The Venetian island of Corfu was the only area of Greece never occupied by the Turks. In 1797 Napoleon conquered Venice and caused the end of the Republic of Venice in the Balkans. Early modern period =Ottoman Empire= 1726 Map of The Ottoman Empire in the Balkans The Balkans at the end of the 19th century Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the Early modern period. Ottoman rule was long, lasting from the 14th century up until the early 20th in some territories. The Ottoman Empire was religiously, linguistically and ethnically diverse, and, at times, a much more tolerant place for religious practices when compared to other parts of the world.Gail Warrander, Verena Knau, Kosovo, 2nd: The Bradt Travel Guide.Edoardo Corradi, Rethinking Islamized Balkans, Balkan Social Science Review, vol. 8, December 2016, p. 121 ‚Äì 139. The different groups in the empire were organised along confessional lines, in the so-called the Millet system. Among the Orthodox Christians of the empire (the Rum Millet) a common identity was forged based on a shared sense of time defined by the ecclesiastical calendar, saint's days and feasts.Kitromilides, Paschalis M. 1996. \\"‚ÄôBalkan mentality‚Äô: history, legend, imagination\\", in: Nations and Nationalism, 2 (2), pp. 163‚Äì191. The social structure of the Balkans in the late 18th century was complex. The Ottoman rulers exercised control chiefly in indirect ways.Franklin L. Ford, Europe: 1780‚Äì1830 (1970) pp 39‚Äì41 In Albania and Montenegro, for example, local leaders paid nominal tribute to the Empire and otherwise had little contact. The Republic of Ragusa paid an annual tribute but otherwise was free to pursue its rivalry with the Republic of Venice. The two Romance-speaking principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia had their own nobility, but were ruled by Greek families chosen by the Sultan. In Greece, the elite comprised clergymen and scholars, but there was scarcely any Greek aristocracy. A million or more Turks had settled in the Balkans, typically in smaller urban centers where they were garrison troops, civil servants, and craftsmen and merchants. There were also important communities of Jewish and Greek merchants. The Turks and Jews were not to be found in the countryside, so there was a very sharp social differentiation between the cities and their surrounding region in terms of language, religion and ethnicity. The Ottoman Empire collected taxes at about the 10% rate but there was no forced labor and the workers and peasants were not especially oppressed by the Empire. The Sultan favoured and protected the Orthodox clergy, primarily as a protection against the missionary zeal of Roman Catholics.Ford, Europe: 1780‚Äì1830 (1970) pp 39‚Äì41 Rise of nationalism in the Balkans The rise of Nationalism under the Ottoman Empire caused the breakdown of millet concept. With the rise of national states and their histories, it is very hard to find reliable sources on the Ottoman concept of a nation and the centuries of the relations between House of Osman and the provinces, which turned into states. Unquestionably, understanding the Ottoman conception of nationhood helps us to understand what happened in the Balkans in the late Ottoman period. * Albanian National Awakening (1830-1881) * Bulgarian National Revival and National awakening of Bulgaria (18-19th century) * Serbian Revolution (1804‚Äì1815/1817/1833) * Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1832) * Bosnian uprising (1831‚Äì1832) The bloody suppression of the April Uprising in Bulgaria, became occasion of the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) and the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878. =Congress of Berlin= Anton von Werner, At the Congress of Berlin (1878) the tall Bismarck on the right is shaking hands with Gyula Andr√°ssy and Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov; on the left are Alajos K√°rolyi, Alexander Gorchakov and Benjamin Disraeli The Congress of Berlin (13 June ‚Äì 13 July 1878) was a meeting of the leading statesmen of Europe's Great Powers and the Ottoman Empire. In the wake of the Russia's decisive victory in a war with Turkey, 1877‚Äì78, the urgent need was to stabilize and reorganize the Balkans, and set up new nations. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who led the Congress, undertook to adjust boundaries to minimize the risks of major war, while recognizing the reduced power of the Ottoman Empire, and balance the distinct interests of the great powers. As a result, Ottoman holdings in Europe declined sharply; Bulgaria was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire, but was not allowed to keep all its previous territory. Bulgaria, without being admitted to the Congress, lost more than 70% of its territory, and over 50% of its ethnic population remained outside its borders‚Äîwhich caused a number of uprisings and brought the country into subsequent Balkan wars. Bulgaria lost Eastern Rumelia, which was restored to the Turks under a special administration. Macedonia, and East and Western Thrace were returned outright to the Turks, who promised reform and Northern Dobrudja became part of Romania, which achieved full independence but had to turn over part of Bessarabia to Russia. Serbia and Montenegro finally gained complete independence, but with smaller territories. Austria took over Bosnia and Herzegovina, and effectively took control of the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. Britain took over Cyprus.A.J.P. Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848‚Äì1918 (1954) pp 228‚Äì54 The results were at first hailed as a great achievement in peacemaking and stabilization. However, most of the participants were not fully satisfied, and grievances regarding the results festered until they exploded into World War in 1914. Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece made gains, but far less than they thought they deserved. The Ottoman Empire, called at the time the \\"sick man of Europe,\\" was humiliated and significantly weakened, rendering it more liable to domestic unrest and more vulnerable to attack. Although Russia had been victorious in the war that caused the conference, it was humiliated at Berlin, and resented its treatment. Austria-Hungary gained a great deal of territory, which angered the South Slavs, and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bismarck became the target of hatred of Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and found that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria in the Balkans.Jerome L. Blum, et al. The European World: A History (1970) p 841 In the long-run, tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary intensified, as did the nationality question in the Balkans. The congress was aimed at the revision of the Treaty of San Stefano and at keeping Constantinople in Ottoman hands. It effectively disavowed Russia's victory over the decaying Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War. The Congress of Berlin returned to the Ottoman Empire territories that the previous treaty had given to the Principality of Bulgaria, most notably Macedonia, thus setting up a strong revanchist demand in Bulgaria that in 1912 was one of many causes of the First Balkan War. 20th century Balkan traditional clothing, c. 1905 =Balkan Wars= Greek lithograph of the Battle of Kilkis‚ÄìLachanas The Balkan Wars were two wars that took place in the Balkans in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war; one of the four, Bulgaria, was defeated in the second war. The Ottoman Empire lost nearly all of its holdings in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, was weakened as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples. The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus was a \\"prelude to the First World War.\\"Richard C. Hall, The Balkan Wars 1912-1913: Prelude to the First World War (2000) =World War I= Coming of war 1914 The monumentally colossal World War I was ignited from a spark in the Balkans, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated the heir to the Austrian throne, Franz Ferdinand. Princip was a member of a Serbian militant group called the Crna Ruka (Serbian for \\"Black Hand\\").https://www.britannica.com/topic/Black-Hand- secret-Serbian-society Following the assassination, Austria-Hungary sent Serbia an ultimatum in July 1914 with several provisions largely designed to prevent Serbian compliance. When Serbia only partially fulfilled the terms of the ultimatum, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914. Many members of the Austro-Hungarian government, such as Conrad von H√∂tzendorf had hoped to provoke a war with Serbia for several years. They had a couple of motives. In part they feared the power of Serbia and its ability to sow dissent and disruption in the empire's \\"south-Slav\\" provinces under the banner of a \\"greater Slav state\\". Another hope was that they could annex Serbian territories in order to change the ethnic composition of the empire. With more Slavs in the Empire, some in the German-dominated half of the government hoped to balance the power of the Magyar-dominated Hungarian government. Until 1914 more peaceful elements had been able to argue against these military strategies, either through strategic considerations or political ones. However, Franz Ferdinand, a leading advocate of a peaceful solution, had been removed from the scene, and more hawkish elements were able to prevail. Another factor in this was the development in Germany giving the Dual-Monarchy a \\"blank cheque\\" to pursue a military strategy that ensured Germany's backing. Austro-Hungarian planning for operations against Serbia was not extensive and they ran into many logistical difficulties in mobilizing the army and beginning operations against the Serbs. They encountered problems with train schedules and mobilization schedules, which conflicted with agricultural cycles in some areas. When operations began in early August Austria-Hungary was unable to crush the Serbian armies as many within the monarchy had predicted. One difficulty for the Austro-Hungarians was that they had to divert many divisions north to counter advancing Russian armies. Planning for operations against Serbia had not accounted for possible Russian intervention, which the Austro-Hungarian army had assumed would be countered by Germany. However, the German army had long planned on attacking France before turning to Russia given a war with the Entente powers. (See: Schlieffen Plan) Poor communication between the two governments led to this catastrophic oversight. Fighting in 1914 As a result, Austria-Hungary's war effort was damaged almost beyond redemption within a couple of months of the war beginning. The Serb army, which was coming up from the south of the country, met the Austrian army at the Battle of Cer beginning on August 12, 1914. The Serbians were set up in defensive positions against the Austro-Hungarians. The first attack came on August 16, between parts of the 21st Austro-Hungarian division and parts of the Serbian Combined division. In harsh night-time fighting, the battle ebbed and flowed, until the Serbian line was rallied under the leadership of Stepa Stepanovic. Three days later the Austrians retreated across the Danube, having suffered 21,000 casualties against 16,000 Serbian casualties. This marked the first Allied victory of the war. The Austrians had not achieved their main goal of eliminating Serbia. In the next couple of months the two armies fought large battles at Drina (September 6 to November 11) and at Kolubara from November 16 to December 15. In the autumn, with many Austro-Hungarians tied up in heavy fighting with Serbia, Russia was able to make huge inroads into Austria-Hungary capturing Galicia and destroying much of the Empire's fighting ability. It wasn't until October 1915 with a lot of German, Bulgarian, and Turkish assistance that Serbia was finally occupied, although the weakened Serbian army retreated to Corfu with Italian assistance and continued to fight against the central powers. Yugoslav Committee, a political interest group formed by South Slavs from Austria-Hungary during World War I, aimed at joining the existing south Slavic nations in an independent state. From this plan, a new kingdom eventually was born: The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians. Montenegro declared war on 6 August 1914. Bulgaria, however, stood aside before eventually joining the Central Powers in 1915, and Romania joined the Allies in 1916. In 1916 the Allies sent their ill-fated expedition to Gallipoli in the Dardanelles, and in the autumn of 1916 they established themselves in Salonika, establishing front. However, their armies did not move from front until near end of the war, when they marched up north to free territories under rule of Central Powers. Bulgaria Bulgaria, the most populous of the Balkan states with 7 million people sought to acquire Macedonia but when it tried it was defeated in 1913 in the Second Balkan War. In 1914 Bulgaria stayed neutral. However its leaders still hoped to acquire Macedonia, which was controlled by an ally, Serbia. In 1915 joining the Central Powers seemed the best route.Tucker, The European powers in the First World War (1996). pp 149‚Äì52 Bulgaria mobilized a very large army of 800,000 men, using equipment supplied by Germany. The Bulgarian-German-Austrian invasion of Serbia in 1915 was a quick victory, but by the end of 1915 Bulgaria was also fighting the British and French‚Äîas well as the Romanians in 1916 and the Greeks in 1917. Bulgaria was ill-prepared for a long war; absence of so many soldiers sharply reduced agricultural output. Much of its best food was smuggled out to feed lucrative black markets elsewhere. By 1918 the soldiers were not only short of basic equipment like boots but they were being fed mostly corn bread with a little meat. Germany increasingly was in control, and Bulgarian relations with its ally the Ottoman Empire soured. The Allied offensive in September 1918, which failed in 1916 & 1917 was successful at Dobro Pole. Troops mutinied and peasants revolted, demanding peace. By month's end Bulgaria signed an armistice, giving up its conquests and its military hardware. The Czar abdicated and Bulgaria's war was over. The peace treaty in 1919 stripped Bulgaria of its conquests, reduced its army to 20,000 men, and demanded reparations of ¬£100 million.Richard C. Hall, \\"Bulgaria in the First World War,\\" Historian, (Summer 2011) 73#2 pp 300‚Äì315 online =Consequences of World War I= Political history of the Balkans The war had enormous repercussions for the Balkan peninsula. People across the area suffered serious economic dislocation, and the mass mobilization resulted in severe casualties, particularly in Serbia where over 1.5 million Serbs died, which was approx. ¬º of the total population and over half of the male population. In less-developed areas World War I was felt in different ways: requisitioning of draft animals, for example, caused severe problems in villages that were already suffering from the enlistment of young men, and many recently created trade connections were ruined. The borders of many states were completely redrawn, and the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later Yugoslavia, was created. Both Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire were formally dissolved. As a result, the balance of power, economic relations, and ethnic divisions were completely altered. Some important territorial changes include: * The addition of Transylvania and Eastern Banat to Romania * The incorporation of Serbia, Montenegro, Slavonia, Croatia, Vojvodina, Carniola, part of Styria, most of Dalmatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. * Istria, Zadar, and Trieste became part of Italy, Between World War I and World War II, in order to create nation-states the following population movements were seen: * In the interwar period, almost 1.5 million Greeks were removed from Turkey; almost 700,000 Turks removed from Greece * The 1919 Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine provided for the reciprocal emigration of ethnic minorities between Greece and Bulgaria. Between 92,000 and 102,000 Bulgarians were removed from Greece; 35,000 Greeks were removed from Bulgaria. Although no agreement on exchange of population between Bulgaria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was ever reached because of the latter's adamant refusal to recognise any Bulgarian minority in its eastern regions, the number of refugees from Macedonia and Eastern Serbia to Bulgaria also exceeded 100,000. Between the two world wars, some 67,000 Turks emigrated from Bulgaria to Turkey on basis of bilateral agreements. * Under the terms of 1940 Treaty of Craiova, 88,000 Romanians and Aromanians of Southern Dobruja were forced to move in Northern Dobruja and 65,000 Bulgarians of Northern Dobruja were forced to move in Southern Dobruja.

They invaded Albania in 1939 and annexed after just a week to the Kingdom of Italy. Then demanded Greece to surrender in October 1940. However, the defiance of the Greek prime minister Metaxas on 28 October 1940, started the Greco-Italian war. After seven months of hard fighting, with some of the first Allied victories and the Italians losing nearly one third of Albania, Germany intervened to save its ally. In 1941, it invaded Yugoslavia with the forces they later used against the Soviet Union. After the fall of Sarajevo on 16 April 1941 to Nazi Germany, the Yugoslav provinces of Croatia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina were recreated as fascist satellite states, Nezavisna Dr≈æava Hrvatska (NDH, the Independent State of Croatia). Croat-nationalist, Ante Paveliƒá was appointed leader. The Nazis effectively created the Handschar division and collaborated with Usta≈°e in order to combat the Yugoslav Partisans. With help from Italy, they succeeded in conquering Yugoslavia within two weeks. They then joined forces with Bulgaria and invaded Greece from the Yugoslavian side. Despite Greek resistance, the Germans took advantage of the Greek army's presence in Albania against the Italians to advance in Northern Greece and consequently conquer the entire country within 3 weeks, with the exception of Crete. However, even with the fierce Cretan resistance, which cost the Nazis the bulk of their elite paratrooper forces, the island capitulated after 11 days of fighting. On May 1 the Balkan frontiers were once again reshuffled, with the creation of several puppet states, such as Croatia and Montenegro, the Albanian expansion into Greece and Yugoslavia, Bulgarian annexation of territories in the Greek North, creation of a Vlach state in the Greek mountains of Pindus and the annexation of all the Ionian and part of the Aegean islands into Italy. With the end of the war, the changes of the ethnic composition reverted to their original conditions and the settlers returned to their homelands, mainly the ones settled in Greece. An Albanian population of the Greek North, the Cams, were forced to flee their lands because they collaborated with the Italians. Their numbers were about 18 000 in 1944. =Aftermath of World War II= On January 7‚Äì9, 1945, Yugoslav authorities killed several hundred of declared Bulgarians in Macedonia as collaborators, in an event known as the \\"Bloody Christmas\\". The Greek Civil War was fought between 1944 and 1949 in Greece between the armed forces of the Greek government, supported at first by Britain and later by the United States, against the forces of the wartime resistance against the German occupation, whose leadership was controlled by the Communist Party of Greece. Its goal was the creation of a Communist Northern Greece. It was the first time in the Cold War that hostilities led to a proxy war. In 1949, the partisans were defeated by the government forces. =Cold War= During the Cold War, most of the countries in the Balkans were ruled by Soviet-supported communist governments. The nationalism was not dead after World War II. Yugoslavia was not an isolated case of ethnic tension. For example: in Bulgaria, beginning in 1984, the Communist government led by Todor Zhivkov began implementing a policy of forced assimilation of the ethnic Turkish minority. Ethnic Turks were required to change their names to Bulgarian equivalents, or to leave the country. In 1989, a Turkish dissident movement was formed to resist these assimilationist measures. The Bulgarian government responded with violence and mass expulsions of the activists. In this repressive environment, over 300,000 ethnic Turks fled to neighboring Turkey.Ethnic Cleansing and the Normative Transformation of International Society However, despite being under communist governments, Yugoslavia (1948) and Albania (1961) fell out with the Soviet Union. After World War 2, communist plans of merging Albania and Bulgaria into Yugoslavia were created, but later nullified when Albania broke all relations with Yugoslavia, due to Tito breaking from the USSR. Marshal Josip Broz Tito (1892‚Äì1980), later rejected the idea of merging with Bulgaria, and instead sought closer relations with the West, later even creating the Non-Aligned Movement, which brought them closer ties with third world countries. Albania on the other hand gravitated toward Communist China, later adopting an isolationist position. The only non-communist countries were Greece and Turkey, which were (and still are) part of NATO. Religious persecutions took place in Bulgaria, directed against the Christian Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches as well as the Muslim, Jewish and others in the country. Antagonism between the communist state and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church eased somewhat after Todor Zhivkov became Bulgarian Communist Party leader in 1956. Zhivkov even used the Bulgarian Orthodox Church for the purposes of his policies. =Post- Communism= The late 1980s and the early 1990s brought the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. As westernization spread through the Balkans, many reforms were carried out that led to implementation of market economy and to privatization, among other capitalist reforms. In Albania, Bulgaria and Romania the changes in political and economic system were accompanied by a period of political and economic instability and tragic events. The same was the case in most of former Yugoslav republics. Yugoslav wars The collapse of the Yugoslav federation was due to various factors in various republics that composed it. In Serbia and Montenegro, there were efforts of different factions of the old party elite to retain power under new conditions along, and an attempt to create Greater Serbia by keeping all Serbs in one state.Ethnic cleansed Great Serbia In Croatia and Slovenia, multi-party elections produced nationally inclined leadership that followed in the footsteps of their previous Communist predecessors and oriented itself towards capitalism and secession. Bosnia and Herzegovina was split between the conflicting interests of its Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks, while Macedonia mostly tried to steer away from conflicting situations. An outbreak of violence and aggression came as a consequence of unresolved national, political and economic questions. The conflicts caused the death of many civilians. The real start of the war was a military attack on Slovenia and Croatia taken by Serb-controlled JNA. Before the war, JNA had started accepting volunteers driven by ideology of Serbian nationalists keen to realise their nationalist goals. The Ten-Day War in Slovenia in June 1991 was short and with few casualties. However, the Croatian War of Independence in the latter half of 1991 brought many casualties and much damage on Croatian towns. As the war eventually subsided in Croatia, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina started in early 1992. Peace only came in 1995 after such events as the Srebrenica massacre, Operation Storm, Operation Mistral 2 and the Dayton Agreement, which provided for a temporary solution, but nothing was permanently resolved. The economy suffered an enormous damage in all of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the affected parts of Croatia. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also suffered an economic hardship under internationally imposed economic sanctions. Also many large historical cities were devastated by the wars, for example Sarajevo, Dubrovnik, Zadar, Mostar, ≈†ibenik and others. The wars caused large population migrations, mostly involuntary. With the exception of its former republics of Slovenia and Macedonia, the settlement and the national composition of population in all parts of Yugoslavia changed drastically, due to war, but also political pressure and threats. Because it was a conflict fueled by ethnic nationalism, people of minority ethnicities generally fled towards regions where their ethnicity was in a majority. Since the Bosniaks had no immediate refuge, they were arguably hardest hit by the ethnic violence. The United Nations tried to create safe areas for the Bosniak populations of eastern Bosnia but in cases such as the Srebrenica massacre, the peacekeeping troops (Dutch forces) failed to protect the safe areas resulting in the massacre of thousands. The Dayton Accords ended the war in Bosnia, fixating the borders between the warring parties roughly to the ones established by the autumn of 1995. One immediate result of population transfers following the peace deal was a sharp decline in ethnic violence in the region. A number of commanders and politicians, notably Serbia's former president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, were put on trial by the United Nations' International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for a variety of war crimes‚Äîincluding deportations and genocide that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Croatia's former president Franjo Tuƒëman and Bosnia's Alija Izetbegoviƒá died before any alleged accusations were leveled at them at the ICTY. Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá died before his trial could be concluded. Initial upsets on Kosovo did not escalate into a war until 1999 when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) was bombarded by NATO for 78 days with Kosovo being made a protectorate of international peacekeeping troops. A massive and systematic deportation of ethnic Albanians took place during the Kosovo War of 1999, with over one million Albanians (out of a population of about 1.8 million) forced to flee Kosovo. This was quickly reversed from the aftermath. 2000 to present Greece has been a member of the European Union since 1981. Greece is also an official member of the Eurozone, and the Western European Union. Slovenia and Cyprus have been EU members since 2004, and Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007. Croatia joined the EU in 2013. North Macedonia also received candidate status in 2005 under its then provisional name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, while the other Balkan countries have expressed a desire to join the EU but at some date in the future. Greece has been a member of NATO since 1952. In 2004 Bulgaria, Romania and Slovenia became members of NATO. Croatia and Albania joined NATO in 2009. In 2006, Montenegro separated from the state of Serbia and Montenegro, also making Serbia a separate state. On October 17, 2007 Croatia became a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2008‚Äì2009 term, while Bosnia and Herzegovina became a non-permanent member for the 2010‚Äì2011 period. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008. Since the 2008 economic crisis, the former Yugoslav countries began to cooperate on levels that were similar to those in Yugoslavia. The term \\"Yugosphere\\" was coined by The Economist after a regional train service \\"Cargo 10\\" was created. Overview of state histories * Albania: The proto Albanians were likely a conglomerate of Illyrian tribes that resisted assimilation with latter waves of migrations into the Balkans. The Ardiaean kingdom, with its capital in Scodra, is perhaps the best example of a centralized, ancient Albanian state. After several conflicts with the Roman Republic, building up to the Third Illyrian War, Ardiaean as well as much of the Balkans was brought into Roman rule for centuries onward. Its last ruler, King Gentius, being taken captive in 167BC to Rome. After the Western Roman Empire's collapse the territory of what is today Albania remained under Byzantine control until the Slavic migrations. It was integrated into the Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century. The territorial nucleus of the Albanian state formed in the Middle Ages, as the Principality of Arb√´r and the Kingdom of Albania. The first records of the Albanian people as a distinct ethnicity also date to this period. Most of the coast of Albania was controlled by the Republic of Venice from the 10th century until the arrival of the Ottoman Turks (Albania Veneta), while the interior was ruled by Byzantians, Bulgarians or Serbs. Despite the long resistance of Skanderbeg, the area was conquered in the 15th century by the Ottoman Empire and remained under their control as part of the Rumelia province until 1912, when the first independent Albanian state was declared. The formation of an Albanian national consciousness dates to the later 19th century and is part of the larger phenomenon of rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire. * Bosnia and Herzegovina: The territory was divided between Croatia and Serbia in the Early Middle Ages. \\"Bosnia\\" itself was a Serbian polity according to the DAI. Bosnia, along with other territories, became part of Duklja in the 11th century. In time, Bosnia became separated under its own ruler. After 1101, Bosnia was detached from Duklja, and subsequently came under Hungarian suzerainty, as was the case with Croatia. Byzantine rule interrupted Hungarian rule, and under Byzantine suzerainty, the Banate of Bosnia came to existence. The later ban became a Hungarian nominal vassal. The Bosnian Church was a Christian church in Bosnia deemed heretical, which some rulers were adherents of. The rulers empowered themselves through trade with Ragusa, and gained lands from Serbia (Herzegovina). Bosnia reached its zenith under the rule of Tvrtko who took more lands, including parts of Dalmatia, and crowned himself as king in 1377. After the Ottoman conquest of Serbia, Bosnia followed. The Sanjak of Bosnia was established, and the local population was subject of Islamization during the following centuries by the Ottoman Empire which guaranteed more rights to Muslims. The ethnic tensions that arose in modern times stem from this religious division. Austria-Hungary took over Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878 and annexed it in 1908. It was subsequently joined to Yugoslavia. After the Bosnian War, the state received international independence for the first time. * Bulgaria: The Bulgars came from northeast and settled the Balkans after 680. They subsequently were absorbed by the numerous local Slavs. Bulgaria became officially Christian in the late 9th century. The Cyrillic was developed in the Preslav Literary School in Bulgaria in the late 9th - beginning of the 10th century. The Bulgarian Church was recognized as autocephalous during the reign of Boris I of Bulgaria and became Patriarchate during tsar Simeon the Great, who greatly expanded the state over Byzantine territory. In 1018, Bulgaria became an autonomous theme in the Roman empire until the restoration by the Asen dynasty in 1185. In the 13th century Bulgaria was once again one of the powerful states in the region. By 1422 all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube became part of the Ottoman state, however local control remained in Bulgarian hands in many places. North of the Danube, Bulgarian Boyars continued to rule for the next three centuries. Bulgarian language continued to be used as the official language north of the Danube until the 19th century. * Croatia: Following the settlement of Slavs in the Roman provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia, Croat tribes established two duchies. They were surrounded by the Franks (and later Venetians) and Avars (and later Magyars), while Byzantines tried to maintain control of the Dalmatian coast. The Kingdom of Croatia was founded in 925. It covered parts of Dalmatia, Bosnia and Pannonia. The state came under Papal (Catholic) influence. In 1102, Croatia entered a union with Hungary. Croatia was still considered a separate, albeit a vassal, kingdom. With the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, Croatia fell after successive battles, finalized in 1526. The remaining part then received Austrian rule and protection. Much of its border areas became part of the Military Frontier, inhabited and protected by Serbs, Vlachs, Croats and Germans since the area had previously become deserted. Croatia joined Yugoslavia in 1918‚Äì20. Independence was retained following the Croatian War. * Greece: Greeks, an ancient ethnic group (Athenians, Spartans, Peloponnesians, Thessalians, Macedonians etc.) and the oldest civilization of Europe and then the Mycenaean civilization on the mainland (1600‚Äì1100 BC). The scope of Greek habitation and rule has varied throughout the ages and as a result the history of Greece is similarly elastic in what it includes. * Montenegro: In the 10th century, there were three principalities on the territory of Montenegro: Duklja, Travunia, and Serbia (\\"Ra≈°ka\\"). In the mid-11th century Duklja attained independence through a revolt against the Byzantines; the Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty ruled as Serbian monarchs, having taken over territories of the former Serbian Principality. It then came under the rule of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty of Serbia. By the 13th century, Zeta had replaced Duklja when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (Zeta) came under the rule of the Bal≈°iƒá noble family, then the Crnojeviƒá noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as Crna Gora (Venetian: '). Large portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878. The Republic of Venice dominated the coasts of today's Montenegro from 1420 to 1797; the area around the Kotor became part of Venetian Albania. Parts were also briefly controlled by the First French Empire and Austria-Hungary in the 19th century. From 1696 until 1851 the metropolitans of Cetinje (of the House of Petroviƒá-Njego≈°) ruled the polity of Montenegro (Old Montenegro) alongside tribal rulers. The Petroviƒá-Njego≈° transformed Montenegro into a principality in 1851 and ruled until 1918. Independence of the Principality of Montenegro was received in 1878. From 1918, it was a part of Yugoslavia. On the basis of an independence referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro became independent. * North Macedonia: North Macedonia officially celebrates 8 September 1991 as Independence day (, Den na nezavisnosta), with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia, albeit legalising participation in future union of the former states of Yugoslavia.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 1278 The anniversary of the start of the Ilinden Uprising (St. Elijah's Day) on 2 August is also widely celebrated on an official level as the Day of the Republic. * Serbia: Following the settlement of Slavs, the Serbs established several principalities, as described in the DAI. Serbia was elevated to a kingdom in 1217, and an empire in 1346. By the 16th century, the entire territory of modern-day Serbia was annexed by the Ottoman Empire, at times interrupted by the Habsburg Empire. In the early 19th century the Serbian Revolution re-established the Serbian state, pioneering in the abolition of feudalism in the Balkans. Serbia became the region's first constitutional monarchy, and subsequently expanded its territory in the wars. The former Habsburg crownland of Vojvodina united with the Kingdom of Serbia in 1918. Following World War I, Serbia formed Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples which existed in several forms up until 2006, when the country retrieved its independence.

","title":"History of the Balkans"},{"id":"994326","text":"Robert Beck (born Robert Lee Maupin or Robert Moppins Jr.; August 4, 1918 - April 30, 1992), better known as Iceberg Slim, was an American pimp who subsequently became an influential author among a primarily African-American readership. Beck's novels were adapted into movies. Early life Robert Maupin was born in Chicago, Illinois. He spent his childhood in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Rockford, Illinois, until he returned to Chicago. When his mother was abandoned by his father, she established a beauty shop and worked as a domestic to support both of them in Milwaukee. In his autobiography, Maupin expressed gratitude to his mother for not abandoning him as well. She earned enough money working in her salon to give her son the privileges of a middle-class life such as a college education, which at that time was difficult for the average person. Slim attended Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama, but having spent time in the \\"street culture\\", he soon began bootlegging and was expelled as a result.https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-fires-that-forged- iceberg-slim/amp After his expulsion, his mother encouraged him to become a criminal lawyer so that he could make a legitimate living while continuing to work with the street people he was so fond of, but Maupin, seeing the pimps bringing women into his mother's beauty salon, was far more attracted to the model of money and control over women that pimping provided. Pimping According to his memoir, Pimp, Slim started pimping at 18 and continued until age 42. The book claims that during his career he had over 400 women, both black and white, working for him. He said he was known for his frosty temperament and for staying calm in emergencies, which combined with his slim build to earn him the street name Iceberg Slim. When verbal instruction and psychological manipulation failed to keep the women compliant, he beat them with wire hangers; in his autobiography he concedes he was a ruthless, vicious man. Slim had been connected with several other popular pimps, one of them Albert \\"Baby\\" Bell, a man born in 1899 who had been pimping for decades and had a Duesenberg and a bejeweled pet ocelot. Another pimp, who had gotten Slim hooked on cocaine, went by the name of \\"Satin\\" and was a major drug figure in the eastern part of the country. Throughout his pimping career, Slim was noted for being able to effectively conceal his emotions, something he said he learned from Baby Bell: \\"A pimp has gotta know his whores, but not let them know him; he's gotta be god all the way.\\" Writing In 1961, after serving 10 months of solitary confinement in a Cook County jail, Maupin decided he was too old for a life of pimping and was unable to compete with younger, more ruthless pimps. In an interview with the Washington Post, he said he retired \\"because I was old. I did not want to be teased, tormented, and brutalized by young whores.\\" In 1961, Maupin moved to Los Angeles and changed his name to Robert Beck, taking the last name of the man his mother was married to at the time. He met Betty Shue, who became his common-law wife and the mother of his three daughters, while he was working as an insecticide salesman. Betty encouraged Beck to write the story of his life as a novel, and they began sporadically writing some draft chapters. According to her, a white writer, whom Beck would later only refer to as \\"the Professor\\", became interested in writing Beck's life story; Beck became convinced that the man was trying to steal their idea for himself, so they cut him out of the deal and finished it without him. Bentley Morris of Holloway House recognized the merit of Pimp, and it was published in 1967. The hip-hop writer Mark Skillz wrote that when Beck began work on Pimp, \\"he made two promises to himself: no glamorizing his former life and no snitching.\\" Hip hop artist Fab 5 Freddy, a friend of Beck's, claimed that \\"Many of Bob's friends were still alive when he wrote that book. So he changed all of their names and descriptions. 'Baby' Bell became 'Sweet' Jones, his best friend 'Satin' became 'Glass Top,' and he created composite characters of some of his former 'employees.'\\" Reviews of Pimp were mixed. Although \\"he found his book being shelved next to other black authors of the angry 60's like Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice and Malcolm X's The Autobiography of Malcolm X\\", Beck's vision was considerably bleaker than most other black writers of the time. His work tended to be based on his personal experiences in the criminal underworld and revealed a world of seemingly bottomless brutality and viciousness. His was the first insider look into the world of black pimps, to be followed by a half-dozen pimp memoirs by other writers. In 1973, Hollie West questioned in The Washington Post whether societal changes and the women's movement would soon render the outlook expressed in Pimp obsolete: \\"The Iceberg Slim of yesteryear is considered an anachronism to the young dudes now out there on the block trying to hustle. They say he is crude and violent, overlooking his tremendous gift of the gab. Iceberg acknowledges that pimping has changed because 'women have changed.' The advent of women's lib, changing sexual mores, general affluence in this society and widespread use of drugs by pimps to control prostitutes have made an impact.\\"West, H. (1973) Washington Post Pimp sold very well, mainly among black audiences. By 1973, it had been reprinted 19 times and had sold nearly 2 million copies. Pimp was eventually translated into German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and Greek. Following Pimp, Beck wrote several more novels, an autobiography, and a story collection. He sold over six million books before his death in 1992, making him one of the best- selling African-American writers. =Recordings= In 1976, Iceberg Slim released the album Reflections, in which he recited passages from his autobiography over a funky musical backing supplied by the Red Holloway Quartet. The album, produced by David Drozen, was initially released on ALA records and reissued in 2008 by Uproar Entertainment. Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Victor W. Valdivia wrote \\"For those who aren't easily offended, this album will be spellbinding. Slim's skills as a storyteller cannot be overstated; even at his crudest, he still spins riveting yarns.\\" Valdivia praised the record for \\"the mixture of street smarts and the intellectual and emotional depth shown here\\", which, he said, was often lacking in Iceberg Slim's followers. =Film adaptations= Slim's second novel, Trick Baby, was adapted as an eponymous 1972 movie directed by Larry Yust and produced independently for $600,000, with a cast of unknowns. Universal Pictures acquired the film for $1,000,000 and released it in 1973 to a considerable amount of Iceberg Slim fanfare; the movie grossed $11,000,000 at the US box office. The New York Times praised the film for its depiction of race relations and the friendship between two con men, set \\"in the grimier reaches of Philadelphia\\". In 2009, television executive producer Rob Weiss, of the HBO show Entourage, and Mitch Davis purchased the film rights to produce Pimp. Personal life After his release from prison in 1961, Beck met Betty Shue, who became his common-law wife and the mother of his three daughters (Melody, Misty and Camille) while he was working as an insecticide salesman. Shue encouraged Beck to write his life story and helped him write drafts. Beck married Diane Millman Beck in 1982. Death According to Beck's widow, Diane Millman Beck, Beck's final years were plagued by financial worries and deteriorating health. Beck suffered from diabetes and became increasingly reclusive. He died from liver failure on April 30, 1992, aged 73. In 2005, Diane Millman Beck and Beck's three daughters from his previous relationship, Melody, Misty and Camille, filed suit against Holloway House for back payment of royalties. They claimed in their suit that Robert Beck died penniless. Influence Scottish author Irvine Welsh said \\"Iceberg Slim did for the pimp what Jean Genet did for the homosexual and thief and William Burroughs did for the junkie: he articulated the thoughts and feelings of someone who had been there.

She served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for thirteen years, and was a member of New Democratic Premier Gary Doer's cabinet from 1999 to 2003. Friesen was born in Oldham, Lancashire, in England, and moved to Canada at a young age. She was educated at McGill University and the University of British Columbia during the 1960s. Friesen was employed by the National Museum of Canada from 1967 to 1973, and has been a faculty member in the University of Manitoba's Department of History since that time. In 1991, she co-edited a work entitled Aboriginal Resource Use in Canada: Historical and Legal Aspects. Friesen was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal Harold Taylor by over one thousand votes in the central-Winnipeg riding of Wolseley. The election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Friesen joined nineteen other New Democrats in the official opposition. In the 1995 provincial election, she was re-elected for Wolseley in a landslide. Also in 1995, she supported Lorne Nystrom for the federal New Democratic Party leadership. The NDP were victorious in the election of 1999, and Friesen again scored an easy victory in her own riding. She was appointed Deputy Premier and Minister of Intergovernment Affairs on October 5, 1999, also receiving ministerial responsibility for Cooperative Development on September 25, 2002. Also in 2002, she defended the provincial government's controversial decision to spray malathion in the Winnipeg area, as a means of controlling the city's insect population during an outbreak of West Nile fever. In 2003, she supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party. Friesen did not run for re-election in 2003, and formally stepped down from cabinet on June 25 of that year. She has subsequently returned to her teaching position at the University of Manitoba, and in 2004 issued a work entitled Magnificent Gifts: The Treaties of Canada with Indians of the Northwest, 1869-76.

He became one of the leading communist intellectuals active in the 1930s. Early life He was born in Colchester, Essex, where he attended the local grammar school. He served as an officer in the British Army in World War I, having joined the Artists' Rifles in 1916, being awarded a Military Cross.A Conversation with Edgell Rickword He was a published war poet, and collected his early verse in Behind the Eyes (1921).http://www.english.emory.edu/LostPoets/Rickword.html On 4 January 1919, Rickword developed an illness that was diagnosed as a \\"general vascular invasion which had resulted in general septicaemia\\". His left eye was so badly infected that they thought it necessary to remove it to prevent the infection from spreading to the other eye. He went up to the University of Oxford in 1919, staying only four terms reading French literature, and leaving when he married. Literary friends from this period included mainly other ex-soldiers: Anthony Bertram, Edmund Blunden, Vivian de Sola Pinto, A. E. Coppard, Louis Golding, Robert Graves, L. P. Hartley, and Alan Porter.Hobday, p. 44. His work appeared in the Oxford Poetry 1921 anthology, with Blunden, Golding, Porter, Graves, Richard Hughes, and Frank Prewett.http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/oxpoetry/index/ir.html Critic He then took up literary work in London. He reviewed for the Times Literary Supplement, which led to his celebrated review of T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land. J. C. Squire published him in the London Mercury, and Desmond MacCarthy as literary editor of the New Statesman gave him work. He started the Calendar of Modern Letters literary review, now highly regarded, in March 1925. It lasted until July 1927, assisted by Douglas Garman and then Bertram Higgins, and contributions from his cousin C. H. Rickword. The Scrutinies books of collected pieces from it were a succes d'estime; the purpose of the publication was a mass killing of the sacred cows of Edwardian literature (G. K. Chesterton, John Galsworthy, John Masefield, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells).David Perkins, A History of Modern Poetry: From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode (1976), p. 419. Its undoubted influence as a precursor of later criticism was very marked in the early days of Scrutiny, the magazine founded a few years later by F. R. Leavis and Q. D. Leavis.Bernard Bergonzi, The Calendar of Modern Letters, The Yearbook of English Studies, Vol. 16, Literary Periodicals Special Number (1986), pp. 150-163. Rickword also wrote for that publication. Communist He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1934,Hobday, p. 153. and became increasingly active in political work during the period of the Spanish Civil War; while still writing poetry. He was friendly with Randall Swingler, the 'official' poetry voice of the CPGB, and with Jack Lindsay, his only real rival as a theoretician. He was closely connected with the leading cultural figures on the hard Left, such as Mulk Raj Anand, Ralph Fox, Julius Lipton, A. L. Morton, Sylvia Townsend Warner and Alick West. When Lawrence & Wishart was created as the official CPGB publishing house, in 1936, Rickword became a director.Hobday, p. 168. It was through Rickword that Lawrence & Wishart published Nancy Cunard's Negro: An Anthology, though at her own expense.Anne Chisholm, Nancy Cunard: A Biography (1979), p. 277. At that same period he was a co-founder of the Left Review, which he edited. His associates included James Boswell, who was the art editor; they had met around 1929.Andy Croft (editor). A Weapon in the Struggle (1998), p. 29. Left Review existed from 1934 to 1938, was set up by Rickword and Douglas Garman, had as writers both CPGB members and notable figures outside the party, and founded Marxist criticism in the UK.Laura Marcus, Peter Nicholls, The Cambridge History of Twentieth-century English Literature (2004), p. 387.M. Keith Booker, Encyclopedia of Literature and Politics: Censorship, Revolution, and Writing (2005), p. 419. Later he became Editor of Our Time, the Communist review, from 1944 to 1947, working with Arnold Rattenburyhttp://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1906567.ece and David Holbrook. Rickword had an upbeat view at the time on the possibilities of popular culture and radical politics, and the circulation rose as he broadened the publication's scope from popular political poetry.Simon Featherstone, War Poetry: An Introductory Reader (1995), p. 46.

The \\"C\\" stands for \\"competition\\". The car used the XK 120 running gear of the contemporary road proven XK120 in a lightweight tubular frame designed by Jaguar Chief Engineer William Heynes with an aerodynamic aluminium body jointly developed by William Heynes, R J (Bob) Knight and later Malcolm Sayer. A total of 53 C-Types were built, 43 of which were sold to private owners mainly in the US. Specification 1953 C-Type The road-going XK120‚Äôs 3.4-litre twin-cam, straight-6 engine produces between 160 and . The C-Type version was originally tuned to around . The early C-Types were fitted with SU carburetors and drum brakes. Later C-Types (mid 1953) are more powerful, using triple twin-choke Weber carburettors and high-lift camshafts. They are also lighter, and from mid 1953 braking performance was improved by disc brakes on all four wheels. The lightweight, multi-tubular, triangulated frame was designed by Heynes. Heynes, Knight and Sayer together developed the aerodynamic body. Made of aluminium in the barchetta style, it is devoid of road-going items such as carpets, weather equipment and exterior door handles. According to the Jaguar Heritage Registry the cars were produced between May 1952 starting with XKC001 and ending August 1953 XK054. The original alloy body was marked with the prefix K (e.g. K1037). Racing 1953 Jaguar C-Type in Ecurie Ecosse colours displayed at Dulwich Picture Gallery, 29 June 2014 C-Type frame The C-Type was successful in racing, most notably at the Le Mans 24 hours race, which it won twice. In 1951, the car won at its first attempt. The factory entered three, whose driver pairings were Stirling Moss and Jack Fairman, Leslie Johnson and triple Mille Miglia winner Clemente Biondetti, and the eventual winners, Peter Walker and Peter Whitehead. The Walker-Whitehead car was the only factory entry to finish, the other two retiring with lack of oil pressure. A privately entered XK120, owned by Robert Lawrie, co-driven by Ivan Waller, also completed the race, finishing 11th. In 1952, Jaguar, worried by a report about the speed of the Mercedes-Benz 300SLs that would run at Le Mans, modified the C-Type‚Äôs aerodynamics to increase the top speed. However, the consequent rearrangement of the cooling system made the cars vulnerable to overheating, and all three retired from the race. The Peter Whitehead-Ian Stewart and Tony Rolt/Duncan Hamilton cars blew head gaskets, and the Stirling Moss-Peter Walker car, the only one not overheating having had a full-sized radiator hurriedly fitted, lost oil pressure after a mechanical breakage. Testing by Norman Dewis at MIRA after the race proved that the overheating was caused more by the revisions to the cooling system than by the altered aerodynamics: the water pump pulley was undersized, so it was spinning too fast and causing cavitation; also the header tank was in front of the passenger-side bulkhead, far from the radiator, and the tubing diameter was too small at 7/8 inch. With the pump pulley enlarged, and the tubing increased to 1 1/4 inch, the problem was eliminated. The main drawback of the new body shape was that it reduced downforce on the tail to the extent that it caused lift and directional instability at speeds over on the Mulsanne Straight. These cars had chassis numbers XKC 001, 002 and 011. The first two were dismantled at the factory, and the third survives in normal C-type form. In 1953, C-Types won again, and also placed second and fourth. This time the body was in thinner, lighter aluminium and the original twin H8 sand cast SU carburettors were replaced by three DCO3 40mm Webers, which helped boost power to . Philip Porter mentions additional changes: > Further weight was saved by using a rubber bag fuel tank ... lighter > electrical equipment and thinner gauge steel for some of the chassis tubes > ... [T]he most significant change to the cars were the triple Weber > carburetors and [switch to] disc brakes. Duncan Hamilton and Tony Rolt won the race at ‚Äì the first time Le Mans had been won at an average of over . Disc brakes were novel in 1953, and Jaguar's win, partly due to their superiority, set off a scramble to include discs in production cars. 1954, the C-Type's final year at Le Mans, saw a fourth place by the Ecurie Francorchamps entry driven by Roger Laurent and Jacques Swaters. Values When new, the car sold for about $6,000, approximately twice the price of an XK120. In an article in the 11 June 2003 issue of Autocar magazine (\\"Slick Cat Jaguar\\", p. 70) the value of a \\"genuine, healthy\\" C-Type is estimated as ¬£400,000, and the value of the 1953 Le Mans winner is about ¬£2 million; replicas are available from a variety of sources from ¬£40,000. A C-Type once owned and raced by Phil Hill sold at an American auction in August 2009 for $2,530,000 and another C-type was sold at the Pebble Beach auction in 2012 for $3,725,000, Recently an unrestored C-Type that raced at Le Mans has sold for ¬£5,715,580, during the Grand Prix Historique race meeting in Monaco. In August 2015, an ex-Ecurie Ecosse Lightweight C-type, chassis XKC052 and the second of only three works lightweights, driven by Peter Whitehead and Ian Stewart to fourth at the 1953 Le Mans 24 Hours, fetched $13.2 million (¬£8.4 million) at auction in California Notes References * External links *Jaguar Heritage Trust - Official Jaguar Heritage Trust Page on 1950s developments *Jaguar Heritage Trust - Official Jaguar Heritage Chassis Number description *Coventry Racers ‚Äì Pages for each of the 54 C-Types, including photos and short histories for many.

PDS connector is at bottom left of photo. The card was mounted parallel to the main logic board, unlike most computer busses in which cards are inserted at right angles to the motherboard. The Processor Direct Slot or PDS, introduced by Apple Computer, in several of their Macintosh models, provided a limited measure of hardware expandability, without going to the expense (in terms of desk space as well as selling price) of providing full-fledged bus expansion slots. Typically, a machine would feature multiple bus expansions slots, if any. However, there was never more than one PDS slot. Rather than providing a sophisticated communication protocol with arbitration between different bits of hardware that might be trying to use the communication channel at the same time, the PDS slot, for the most part, just gave direct access to signal pins on the CPU, making it closer in nature to a local bus. Thus, PDS slots tended to be CPU-specific, and therefore a card designed for the PDS slot in the Motorola 68030-based Macintosh SE/30, for example, would not work in the Motorola 68040-based Quadra 700. The one notable exception to this was the PDS design for the original Motorola 68020-based Macintosh LC.

In October 2007, The Diane Rehm Show was named to the Audience Research Analysis list of the top ten most powerful national programs in public radio, the only talk show on the list. ACT 1 Systems Inc., using Nielsen audience data, estimated that the program (sometimes shortened to \\"The DR Show\\") at that time had \\"1.7 million listeners,\\" a number that was later revised upward to 2.4 million listeners in December 2015. It was produced by WAMU and hosted by Diane Rehm. The show debuted on WAMU in the 1970s as Kaleidoscope, a weekday morning arts and discussion program. Diane took over as host in 1979, and the show became The Diane Rehm Show in 1984. The final broadcast of The Diane Rehm Show was aired on December 23, 2016. As of January 2, 2017, WAMU broadcasts 1A in the same timeslot.  Format  The show aired live Monday through Friday from 10:00 to 12:00 EST, but some local stations re-aired it at later times. The first hour of the show was an in-depth discussion of a topic or theme in the news. Occasionally, it was an interview with a newsmaker. Two examples of past show topics for the first hour include \\"European & Arab Media on the U.S. in Iraq\\" and \\"Drug-Resistant Bacteria\\". The second hour was either an interview with an author about a book or a segment of general interest. The books could be fiction or nonfiction and covered a wide range of subjects and opinions. Occasionally, Rhem allowed callers to call in and interact with the author directly, often resulting in a lively debate. There were also recurring features. Each Friday, there was a two-hour weekly \\"News Roundup\\" where the major national and international headlines of the past week were discussed by reporters. The first hour was devoted to domestic American news, the second to international stories. A (usually) monthly \\"Reader's Review\\" was when older books are reviewed and discussed. The show was produced by Sandra Pinkard, Nancy Robertson, Susan Nabors and Denise Couture, Monique Nazareth and Sarah Ashworth. The engineers were Tobey Schreiner, Jonathan Charry, Timothy Olmstead, and Andrew Chadwick. Natalie Yuravlivker answered the phones. Streaming recordings of the show are available via the official web site.  Host  Diane Rehm hosted the show from 1979, when it was titled 'Kaleidoscope'; it was renamed for her in 1984. The show was sometimes guest hosted when Rehm was out for treatment for her spasmodic dysphonia, by a rotating list of NPR and NPR-related hosts including Susan Page, Tom Gjelten, Steve Roberts, Terence Smith, Frank Sesno, Andrea Seabrook, and Katty Kay. In March 2007, Rehm missed shows due to a bout of pneumonia. In March 2007, Diane Rehm suffered severe and painful corneal burns when she sprayed perfume on her contact lens during a trip to Oklahoma City. Rehm said that she labeled the identical three-ounce tinted plastic bottles to show they held different solutions but that the labels became blurred and hard to read, especially without her lenses in. From August 21 into September 2009, Susan Page, of USA Today, filled in for the sidelined host, initially reporting that Rehm \\"caught her heel in the hem of her slacks while she was dashing across the street yesterday afternoon, and she cracked her pelvis when she fell.\\" Rehm's spasmodic dysphonia has also required her to miss several shows in recent years.

It may have square or semicircular ends, and as a rule it is what upholsterers call \\"overstuffed\\", meaning no wood is visible. It may be used as a stool, footstool or as an alternative to a sofa. Ottomans are often sold as coordinating furniture with armchairs or gliders. An ottoman can also be used as and called a \\"footstool\\", tuffet, hassock, or pouffe. \\"Ottoman\\" may also denote an upholstered seat without a back or arms, but one that usually serves as storage, with the seat hinged to form a lid. History The ottoman traces its roots to furnishing practices in the Ottoman Empire, where it was the central piece of residential seating, generally designed as a low wooden platform intended to be piled with cushions. It was first designed as sectional furniture that wrapped around three walls of a room, before evolving into smaller versions that fit into the corner of a room or circular padded seats surrounding a column or pole in a public room. The ottoman was eventually brought to Europe from the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century and named after its place of origin. The earliest known instance of the use of the name is ottomane in French in 1729, while the first known recorded use in English occurs in one of Thomas Jefferson's memorandum books from 1789: \\"P[ai]d. for an Ottomane of velours d'Utrecht.\\"Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. \\"ottoman\\", accessed 6 March 2013. Over time, European ottomans took on a circular or octagonal shape through the 19th century, with seating divided in the center by arms or by a central, padded column that might hold a plant or statue. As clubs became more popular, so did the ottoman, which began to have hinged seats underneath to hold storage.

He has served successively in the Michigan House of Representatives, the Michigan Senate, the United States House of Representatives and then again the Michigan Senate, from which he was term- limited in January 2011. He has served as County Executive of Bay County, Michigan since January, 2017. Early life and education Barcia was born in Bay City, Michigan and graduated from Bay City Central High School. He received a B.A. from Saginaw Valley State University in 1974. He was staff assistant to United States Senator Philip A. Hart of Michigan in 1971. Barcia also was a community service coordinator for the Michigan Blood Center, between 1974 and 1975, and he was an administrative assistant to Michigan state representative Donald J. Albosta, from 1975 to 1976. Career Barcia was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives, from 1977 to 1983. He left the House after being elected to the Michigan Senate, where he served until he resigned in 1993 to enter the United States House of Representatives. Barcia's Congressional District from 1993 to 2002 Barcia was elected as a Democrat from Michigan's 5th congressional district to the 103rd Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1993 to January 3, 2003. Like many Michigan Democrats outside of Ann Arbor, Detroit, and Flint, Barcia was quite moderate. He was opposed to abortion and gun control, and had a lifetime rating of 54 from the American Conservative Union‚Äîthe highest of any Democrat from Michigan at the time. After the United States 2000 Census, Barcia's district was dismantled by the Republican- controlled state legislature. Most of his district's territory was shifted to the 10th District, but his home in Bay City was merged with the neighboring 9th District of fellow Democrat Dale Kildee. The new district retained Barcia's district number (the 5th), but was geographically more Kildee's district. Under the circumstances, Barcia opted to run for his old seat in the State Senate and won. On October 10, 2002, Jim Barcia was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq. With Kildee announcing his retirement July 2011, Barcia considered running for his congressional seat in 2012. In 2016, Barcia won a heated election to the position of Bay County Executive, after winning the Democratic primary against long-time incumbent Thomas L. Hickner in August. During the campaign, Barcia was accused of hiding campaign funds and using a misleading TV ad.

He was conceived and written by Hironobu Sakaguchi, while his appearance was designed by Yoshitaka Amano and re-interpreted by Toshiyuki Itahana. Like other members of the Final Fantasy IX cast, but unlike characters of previous Final Fantasy games, Zidane was designed after the plot for the game was written. Presented as a charming, puckish character, Zidane has a happy, outgoing and self-confident personality whose mixture of lechery and devil-may-care attitude helps put danger in perspective. Zidane has appeared in the Dissidia Final Fantasy spin-off series, and in smaller roles in various spin-off Final Fantasy and crossover games. While some sources have criticized Final Fantasy IX's art style and the visual design of its characters, Zidane is mostly well received, particularly in Japan where he is rated as one of the most popular Final Fantasy characters in fan polls. Various sources have commented on Zidane's characterization being a departure from prior Final Fantasy protagonists who are known for being moody as well as his relationship with Garnet, while criticism was focused on his inconsistent character arc. Concept and creation Zidane, along with other characters, was designed after the creation of Final Fantasy IXs plot, unlike its predecessors, Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII, which had its protagonists created before the story. Both Zidane and Vivi's size and age were less than that of the characters from the above-mentioned other titles. He was one of the original three characters revealed, along with Vivi and Steiner. He was conceived and written by Hironobu Sakaguchi, while his appearance was designed by Yoshitaka Amano and re-interpreted by Toshiyuki Itahana. His womanizing aspect was designed by Hiroyuki Ito. Sakaguchi described him as a person who \\"likes girls and doesn't care for much\\", lacking any real objective and being carefree, but a key character nonetheless. Zidane has shoulder-length blonde hair, blue eyes, and a prehensile monkey-like tail, as witnessed in game when Zidane hangs from his tail to evade Steiner. He can either use two daggers or a single swallow-blade as weapons. In trance form, Zidane's hair becomes longer, and his clothing is replaced with pink fur. Zidane is identified as a thief, and has the unique ability to steal items from enemies. As he is considered the main character of Final Fantasy IX, the stealing mechanic was made more important than in previous games, which means that players have ample opportunity to acquire a lot of valuable items earlier than normal through stealing them from enemies. He was redesigned by Tetsuya Nomura in the video game Dissidia Final Fantasy. He is voiced by Romi Park and Bryce Papenbrook in the Japanese and English versions of Dissidia respectively. Appearances =Final Fantasy IX= Zidane first appears in the video game Final Fantasy IX as one of its protagonists. Prior to the events of the game, an orphaned Zidane leaves his adoptive father Baku to search for his real home, his only memory being a blue light.Zidane: \\"Once upon a time... ...there was a man. There was a man who didn't know where he came from...\\" / Dagger: \\"...Zidane?\\" / Zidane: \\"This man had longed to find his birthplace ever since he was a small child. His birthplace. A place he only remembered in his dreams...\\" / Dagger: \\"Why...?\\" / Zidane: \\"He wanted to know more about himself, maybe. About his place, the house where he was born... One day, the man left the home of his adoptive father and went on a quest to find the answer. His only clue was the blue light he saw in his dreams...\\" Unsuccessful in his search, he returns to Baku and rejoins his troupe of performers and criminals called Tantalus.Zidane: \\"Hey, you're jumping ahead. A lot of things happened along the way. Alright, we can skip ahead... No, he never found it. How could he? His only clue was a colored light. So he went back to the home of his adoptive father... What do you think his father did when he came home?\\" At the age of sixteen, he becomes involved in Baku's scheme to kidnap Princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII, fomented by Regent Cid Fabool VIII of Lindblum in order to distance the princess from her increasingly hawkish adoptive mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria.Regent Cid: \\"I once promised your father , that should anything happen, I would protect you. We've known about the disturbances in Alexandria for some time. But had we acted directly, it would've started a war. So, I asked Baku for help. He and I go way back. The play was the perfect cover to enter Alexandria and get you out. No one would suspect Lindblum was behind it. We were forced to take action, because we knew Alexandria would never seek our help. I'm relieved we were able to get you here.\\" Zidane and his cohorts travel to the kingdom of Alexandria aboard the airship Prima Vista, ostensibly to perform a theatre play as a part of their plot to kidnap Princess Garnet. While the rest of the crew is performing the play \\"I Want to be Your Canary\\" before Queen Brahne and her citizens, Zidane would use the cover to sneak in and attempt to kidnap the princess. He first encounters her when she tries to sneak out of the palace herself, and, at her request, promises to do his best to kidnap her.Hooded Girl: \\"As you have no doubt suspected... ...the truth is that... I am actually... Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, heir to the throne of Alexandria. I have a favor I wish to ask of you... I wish to be kidnapped...right away.\\"Zidane: \\"Alright then, Your Highness! I shall hereby do my best to kidnap you!\\" During the crew's escape flying out of the castle in the Prima Vista with the princess, the Queen's forces managed to damage the airship. From there, Zidane and his crew, along with Garnet, her stowaway bodyguard Adelbert Steiner, and a little black mage named Vivi all wind up crash-landing into a magical forest full of monsters. The group will commence their travel into a world-spanning adventure involving war, subterfuge, magical crystals, summoned monsters, and clones. Zidane takes a liking to the princess and does not hesitate to flirt with her throughout the game, much to Steiner's dismay. His dagger became the inspiration for Princess Garnet's chosen alias for herself.Garnet: \\"Stop it, you two! ...Steiner, I do not intend to return to the castle. And I do see Zidane's point. I need a new name... Zidane... What is this called?\\" Zidane: \\"That? That's a dagger. All knives of that length are called daggers. Short swords are a bit longer. The big sword you hold with both hands is called a broadsword. And...\\" Garnet: \\"Oh, okay... I understand now. So this is called a 'dagger'...\\" Steiner: \\"Princess! It's a weapon! Please be careful.\\" Garnet: \\"I've decided! From now on, my name is...\\" Zidane would adapt to his role as party leader, and his charisma and personality drawing many characters in the game: Eiko joins the party after becoming infatuated with him, and his rival Amarant joins the party out of curiosity following his defeat by Zidane.Red-headed Man: \\"What are you after?\\" / Zidane: \\"Follow me and maybe you'll understand. Besides, you're pretty good in a fight. We could use someone like you. We're hunting a man down.\\" / Red-headed Man: (Hmph. His only constant is his unpredictability...) / Zidane: \\"Huh? You say something'?\\" / Red-headed Man: \\"Very well. I'll find out what makes you so strong.\\" Later in the game, it is discovered that the true reason for Zidane's existence is revealed: he is a Genome, an artificially constructed cloned life form doll-like humanoid. He was originally created by the wizard Garland on the planet Terra to replace his failed creation, the villain Kuja, as a more powerful \\"Angel of Death\\", whose purpose is to wipe out all life on the planet Gaia.\\"Zidane: So...Kuja is just an angel of death who sends souls to the Tree of Iifa. / Garland: Yes, my angel of death. But only until you came of age. / Zidane: What do you mean!? / Garland: His soul is not eternal... I was going to create you next, after all.Garland: \\"When you received the gift of life in Bran Bal, Kuja could not bear it. He could not bear to see a Genome with more power than his own; he felt threatened. Kuja discarded you. He dropped you onto Gaia, the world he would destroy.\\" As part of the Terran's original plan to save their dying civilization, the young planet of Gaia was selected for on assimilation. The Terrans left their physical bodies and locked their souls in Pandemonium to be watched over by Garland until the Fusion's completion. The Fusion was a disastrous failure, leaving Gaia's surface in ruin and ending up with Terra shifting inside the planet of Gaia. Garland was tasked with removing the souls of Gaia's \\"cycle of souls\\" and replacing them with Terra's. The Genomes are empty, soulless vessels synthesized by Garland to eventually host the Terran souls, and he planted the Iifa Tree, a gigantic brain-like tree filtering the souls of Gaia. Bitter and jealous of his successor, Kuja casts Zidane down to Gaia, where he is found and adopted by Baku. The revelation drives Zidane to despair and he briefly abandons the party, but later returns the group manages to after mollify him. After the party is rescued from the Iifa Tree by Kuja, Zidane choose to go back inside the collapsing structure to save Kuja. For nearly a year it is believed that he did not survive; however, he makes a dramatic reappearance on stage in Alexandria at the end of the game. =Other Appearances= Zidane appears as the protagonist hero representing Final Fantasy IX in the Dissidia series of games: Dissidia Final Fantasy, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, and Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia. He is also featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy and Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call as the main character representing Final Fantasy IX. His appearances in Final Fantasy spin-off games include Final Fantasy Record Keeper, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, and Final Fantasy All the Bravest. His appearances in crossover video games include Itadaki Street Portable, Monster Strike, and Puzzle and Dragons. Reception Since his appearance in Final Fantasy IX, Zidane has received a generally positive reception. He is regarded by Famitsu readers as one of the best video game characters, placing #17 in the Famitsu top 50 character ranking in 2010. In 2020 NHK conducted an All-Final Fantasy Grand Poll of Japanese players, featuring over 468,000 votes. The poll results revealed that Zidane was ranked the fifth greatest Final Fantasy character by Japanese respondents, just after Vivi who was ranked fourth. Game journalists listed him as one of the greatest Final Fantasy characters based on multiple of his traits. Some reviewers praised the character's personality. IGN editor David Smith called him charming, and that he \\"breaks the streak of reluctant Final Fantasy heroes, injecting a touch of redder blood back into the series\\". For Zidane's appearance in Dissidia Final Fantasy, IGN editor Ryan Clements described Zidane as a \\"laid back, flirtatious character and one full of energy and enthusiasm\\", unlike his peers from other numbered entries. He adds that seeing his \\"short blades spin in a dizzying frenzy is definitely a sight to behold.\\" GameSpot editor Andrew Vestal called Zidane's \\"instinctive womanizing\\" as an amusing trait of his. Jeremy Parish from Polygon thought Zidane have \\"a roguish, Han Solo-like quality to him, making him something of a small fry and an outsider in a big-picture narrative that involves kingdoms at war, almighty summoned monsters and ancient races\\", until the manifestation of conventional Final Fantasy tropes which reveal Zidane's true cosmic origins. Lucas White from Playstation Lifestyle noted that \\"his personality and motivations are drastically different from those of his peers, making him the driving force of Final Fantasy IX‚Äôs unique flavor\\" , and that at his core is \\"his ability to protect people he cares about; his essence is his virtue\\". Daniella Lucas from Gamesradar thought Zidane was \\"cool with his dual daggers\\", and noted that \\"Zidane‚Äôs tale of adventure and self discovery while dealing with the evil that Kuja inflicts upon the world of Gaia is as classic as Final Fantasy gets\\". Michel S. Beaulieu, co-author of the book Final Fantasy and Philosophy: The Ultimate Walkthrough suggested that Zidane is a revolutionary, fighting against the abusive power of the upper class, represented by Queen Brahne. Nadia Oxford from USGamer commented that she had mixed feelings about how Zidane's character is developed, in particular the Genomes and Terra reveal towards the end of the game, which she believes overlaps with Vivi's character arc. Oxford believed that there could have been an interesting contrast between Zidane and Vivi if the entire sequence was handled with a better focus; Oxford compared him to other Final Fantasy protagonists such as Terra Branford and Cloud, noting that it was typical of JRPG's from the 1990s where many characters would suffer an existential crisis upon realizing that they are not who they actually think they are. Nevertheless, Oxford is satisfied by his overall character arc, noting that the surprise reveal of Zidane's true nature does tie into the game's narrative theme. Oxford concluded that Zidane is likeable and well-developed as a character, as he eventually accepts that he is not the sum of his parts and he could find his own purpose. GameCritics editor Erin Bell called Zidane the \\"strangest looking Final Fantasy hero to date\\", citing his \\"nondescript features and monkey tail\\". However, she did describe him as a hero that is easy for one to understand and sympathize with. Zidane also received a less positive response from some reviewers. Beaulieu described Zidane and his altruistic motto of \\"you don't need a reason to help people\\" as a \\"hopeless case\\" when judged against the Hobbesian model of moral philosophy. Chris Carter of Destructoid was of the view that Zidane as the protagonist of Final Fantasy IX is not being discussed as much as his peers from other Final Fantasy games, and expressed a personal preference for Vivi. Houston Press expressed disappointment with the story of Final Fantasy IX as he felt Garnet was more interesting as a main character than Zidane, criticizing how besides having some unlikable traits, in the ending the character tries to save the main antagonist, Kuja. Scott Baird from Screen Rant echoed Oxford's view that Zidane's character arc overlaps with Vivi's, commenting that the plot twist \\"might not have been so bad if it wasn't also being done in a far superior manner with Vivi\\", and criticized the developers' decision to add \\"unnecessary layers of grimness\\" to Zidane's backstory which came out of nowhere and \\"doesn't really add anything to the story\\". Zidane's relationship with Garnet has invited some comment from various sources. GamesRadar and Screen Rant believed that their relationship is poorly depicted, citing a lack of chemistry between the two characters and disapproved of their big-headed, childlike character design. Mia Consalvo, author of \\"Hot Dates and Fairy-Tale Romances\\" published in the book The Video Game Theory Reader, described his appearance as feminized, referencing his small stature, long hair, clothing with laces, and lack of obvious muscles. She questioned whether heterosexual players may identify less with a character like this, and whether homosexual players may. She added that his relationship with female protagonist Garnet saves him from being considered \\"abnormal\\", and that the ultimate goal is for the players to relate to Zidane as best as possible. She added that no matter how the players proceed, Zidane always ends up forming a relationship with Garnet, and players are encouraged to insert themselves into the character as their avatar. Because of this, she questions how female and homosexual players would feel about their relationship, which she states would destroy the immersion. IGNs Leah B. Jackson was more positive towards the relationship, finding the early premise that Garnet wanted to be kidnapped by Zidane intriguing. Jason Schreier from Kotaku praised the game‚Äôs final scene, in which Zidane returns to Garnet, as being particularly memorable. Promotion and merchandise Zidane, along with three other protagonists of the Final Fantasy series, Cloud Strife, Squall Leonheart, and Tidus were released as figurines as part of the first volume of the Dissidia Final Fantasy Trading Arts series to celebrate the franchise's 20th anniversary. Zidane, along with Cloud, Squall, Tidus, and Lightning are part of a line of super-deformed mini figures released by Dissidia Final Fantasy Trading Arts series. Zidane was released as a figurine in Square Enix's Bring Arts line, sold as a pair along with Garnet.

Here most comfortable weather is the summer season.Nathiagali weather forecast, Publisher: nathiagali.com . Retrieved 10 November 2012. Frequent rainfall occurs here annually. Rainfall lies between 1650mm-1850mm annually.in winter temperature can drop to _10*C and in summer it rise to a high of 30*C. Transportation The town is connected to Abbottabad and Murree by Nathiagali road. Public transport runs daily from Abbottabad and Rawalpindi to Nathiagali. Between December to January, heavy snowfall can occur in this area and the road leading to Nathiagali is sometimes blocked due to heavy snow. Communication Nathiagali is covered by all GSM operators. Land line phone service is also available here. Accommodation Hotels, rest houses and cottages equipped with most facilities are available here for the tourists. From May to August their rates become high. A small market also exists here where all the basic necessities of life are available. Tourism Nathia Gali town also serves as the administrative centre of Nathia Gali Union Council. It is today located in what is the Abbottabad District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At an elevation of 2,410 m (8,000 ft), it is a popular tourist resort in the summer months. It is forested with pine, cedar, oak walnut and also oak and maple trees. During the summer, Nathia Gali is relatively popular amongst tourists, but due to its limited area and availability of property, it is not thronged by as many people as the hill-station Murree, which is only an hour away, even though it has more recreation. Nathiagali is known for a beautiful trek that leads to Thandiani that passes through Dagri naka. Ayubia National Park is also one of the spots here that tourists and nature lovers often visit.  Scenery  Scenic view of Nathia Gali The natural scenery is highly attractive. Nathia Gali is famous for its lush green meadows, deep forests of oak, cedar and pine, where fog in July/August present a glory. In winter snowfall adds to the scene. Nathia Gali has a church, St. Matthew's, a remnant from the British period and made entirely of wood. It is situated at the edge of the mountain with a nice panorama towards Kashmir. Nathia Gali has a mini bazaar. Mukshpuri and Miranjani are two nearby high peaks. On a clear day, the Nanga Parbat can be seen in the distance. Wildlife The Nathia Gali region is home to various species of birds, insects, butterflies and other animals. The World Wildlife Fund has an office in the Galliat and has assisted in the breeding and reintroduction of the species of the near-extinct common hill leopard in the forests of the Ayubia National park, right by Dungagali and Nathia Gali. This area was thought to be a perfect habitat for them but according to local reports they frequently came out of the forest after cattle of the local villagers and were occasionally shot. Packs of pi-dogs which were previously considered to be a night-time menace can no longer be seen anywhere in the Galliat; it is thought that most have been killed by leopards. In the summer of 2006, several women were found dead in the deep valleys of Galliat with wounds from attacks. A large leopard was caught and eventually shot. His body has been stuffed and kept in the Dunga Gali Wildlife Museum, where he has been named the 'Ghost of Galyat'. However, despite their reputation, these leopards are rarely spotted. Horses are a common sight during summer months and are offered to children and adults alike for rides at rates that are often negotiable. The common hill rhesus monkeys can often be seen. Previously known to be a little shy, they have reportedly become more aggressive in recent years. This may be due to increased interaction with tourists, who often tease these monkeys or try to catch them. Monkeys often come up to guesthouses and hotels in search of snacks and can be quite noisy and playful. Visitors are advised to sun their bedding on arrival to get rid of bed-bugs, and to keep repellents and pesticides for insects as these have a tendency to show up a lot, especially in old homes, and in the monsoon season. Subdivisions Administrative subdivisions of Nathia Gali. The Union Council of Nathia Gali is divided into the following areas: Bagan, Donga Gali, Jhansa, Keri Sarafali, Keri Raiki, Lassan, Malach, Nathiagali and Pasala.Nathia Gali Union Council  Ethnic groups  The main tribe of Nathia Gali are the Karlal and a minority of Dhunds (who now call themselves 'Dhund-Abbasis').Hazara Gazetteer 1921; They are akin to the people of Murree area nearby, in Punjab, a continuation of the Galyat range The locals are a kin to the people of other parts of Galyat and speak the Hindko language. Until well into the 1960s, most of these tribes and clans were mostly living rather basic and primitive lives, due to lack of educational and employment opportunitiesHazara Divisional Report, 1991-1992, Pub. Govt. of NWFP, 1993, pp. 45-46 and most of them had to seek jobs and education down in the plains and cities such as Rawalpindi, Lahore, Peshawar and even as far away as Karachi; but in more recent times, with economic development, many of them are either employed locally in the tourism industry or in various jobs and businesses in the Abbottabad area.

The story revolves around a man who makes a pornographic film in his apartment with a friend and an attention-seeking starlet, while his teenage son stays in his room and listens to ambient noise music. The film is notable for its explicit imagery, including close-ups of vaginal reconstruction surgery, an anal sex scene without the use of lubrication, a masturbation scene with a toothbrush, and an extended scene about the woman's vagina. Moodysson leaves the interpretation of the film to the viewer: \\"I have cooked you a delicious meal, but I'm not going to chew it for you.\\" Plot In an apartment somewhere in Sweden, a woman, a man and his friend are recording an amateur porn movie, while the one man's teenage son is trying to stay out of their way in his room. As time progresses, their filming gets out of hand. All the while, the father is concerned that his son has no respect for him, and the son is concerned about how his father treats the woman. Cast * Thorsten Flinck as Richard * Sanna Br√•ding as Tess * Bj√∂rn Almroth as Erik * Goran Marjanovic as Geko Production Moodysson's original intent was to have the film taking place in the United States, using an American cast. Research was made about the American porn industry, but eventually Moodysson decided to set the story in Sweden: \\"I was, like, hit by a truck ‚Äî and that truck was Lilya 4-ever. When I tried to return to that American version, some kind of story that takes place in the American porn industry, I discovered I couldn‚Äôt do it. I had to transform it into this much smaller and more claustrophobic Swedish story.\\"Anderson, Jason \\"Heart Attack: Lukas Moodysson on A Hole in My Heart.\\" Cinema Scope (22). Retrieved on 2009-05-19. Filming took place during 4 weeks in Trollh√§ttan. The film was shot digitally with DVCams. After the first day of filming, Thorsten Flinck went to a hospital and lied to a doctor about having an aching back, which prompted the doctor to give him three morphine pills. When Flinck woke up the next morning he started the day by swallowing all three pills. He was nearly fired when he arrived at the set on drugs, but was given a second chance. The rest of the production was free from incidents. Release The film premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released in Sweden on 17 September 2004. The theatrical poster featured a warning sign about strong images. Lukas Moodysson has expressed disapproval over the future VHS and DVD releases of the film (the decision to release it was out of his hands) -- he would have preferred a theatres-only release, to avoid children being exposed to it. =Critical response= The Swedish reception was split. With a few reservations, Malena Janson at Svenska Dagbladet rated the film 5 out of 6 and praised Moodysson for his daring approach: \\"A Hole in My Heart consolidates Moodysson's role as the fearless innovator, border stretcher and truth teller in European cinema - who fully masters, and isn't reluctant to use, the film medium's artistic and political possibilities.

Jens Peterson at Aftonbladet respected the film for being uncompromising, but couldn't give it a higher rating than 2 out of 5: \\"Several times, the narrative style stands in the way of the story.

Spanning the Chesapeake Bay, it connects the state's rural Eastern Shore region with the urban Western Shore. The original span, opened in 1952 and with a length of , was the world's longest continuous over-water steel structure. The parallel span was added in 1973. The bridge is officially named the Gov. William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge after William Preston Lane Jr. who, as the 52nd Governor of Maryland, initiated its construction in the late 1940s finally after decades of political indecision and public controversy. The bridge is part of U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301, and serves as a vital link in both routes. As part of cross-country US 50, it connects the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area with Ocean City, Maryland, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and other coastal tourist resort destinations. As part of US 301, it serves as part of an alternative route for Interstate 95 travelers, between northern Delaware and the Washington, D.C., area. Because of this linkage, the bridge is busy and has become known as a point of traffic congestion, particularly during peak hours and summer months. The bridge's role in transportation was filled by ferries prior to the first span's construction. An annual 10K run across the bridge has been organized on-and-off since 1975. The bridge's economic impact on the areas it connects has been significant, with both Queen Anne's County and Ocean City expanding significantly since the bridge's construction. Future expansion of the bridge has been discussed since 2004, with a task force being formed to investigate the possibility of building a third span. History =Proposals and ferries= It is possible that studies may have been conducted as early as the 1880s into the possibility of a bridge across the Chesapeake Bay. However, the first known proposal came about in 1907 and called for a crossing between Baltimore and Tolchester Beach. In 1927, local businesspeople were authorized to finance the construction of a Baltimore to Tolchester Beach crossing. Plans for the new bridge were made, but construction was canceled following the Stock Market Crash of 1929 with the collapse of the American economy and resulting Great Depression of the 1930s. Ferries were used as the main mode of transportation across the bay from the colonial period until the completion of the 1952 bridge. The first service ran from Annapolis to Broad Creek on Kent Island, roughly where the bridge is today. In 1919, the Claiborne‚ÄìAnnapolis Ferry Company began running ferries between Annapolis and Claiborne, a community near St. Michaels. In July 1930, the Claiborne‚ÄìAnnapolis Ferry Company added a new route, one running from Annapolis to Matapeake, a significantly shorter distance. The auto and passenger ferries were taken over by the State Roads Commission in 1941 (reorganized into today's State Highway Administration of the Maryland Department of Transportation in 1973). Two years later, the commission moved the western terminus of the old Annapolis‚ÄìMatapeake ferry to Sandy Point (later adjacent to Sandy Point State Park), shortening the cross-bay trip. =Construction of 1952 span= A 1938 proposal by the Maryland General Assembly was the first to call for a bridge at the Sandy Point‚ÄìKent Island location. Although the legislation authorizing the new bridge passed, the involvement of the United States in World War II delayed the bridge's construction. In 1947, with the war over, the Assembly, under the leadership of Maryland Governor William Preston Lane Jr., (1892‚Äì1967), passed legislation directing the old State Roads Commission to begin construction. Ground was broken in January 1949, and after a -year construction project, the bridge opened to traffic on July 30, 1952, as both the longest continuous over-water steel structure, and the third longest bridge in the world. Before the opening, a parade of vehicles made the first official crossing, led by then current Governor Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin, (1900‚Äì1974), and other state officials in a distinctive white Cadillac convertible flying huge American and Maryland flags. On November 9, 1967, the bridge was dedicated to Governor Lane, who had died earlier that year, and officially renamed the \\"William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge\\". =1973 expansion= In 1967, due to increasing traffic volumes, the Maryland General Assembly authorized three possible new crossings, all suggested during the 1964 Chesapeake Bay crossing study. These included one further north near Baltimore, one in southern Maryland, and an additional span to be added to the existing bridge from Kent Island to Sandy Point; ultimately, the third option was chosen. Construction of the new parallel span began in 1969 to the north of the original bridge, and it was completed on June 28, 1973. =Notable incidents= The Bay Bridge during 2003's alt=Rain falls on the Bay Bridge Police block traffic leading up to the Bay Bridge during alt=People in safety vests reroute traffic Because of its height, the narrowness of the spans (there are no hard shoulders), the low guardrails, and the frequency of high winds, it is often cited as one of the scariest bridges in the United States. Several weather-related incidents have caused complete closures of the bridge. The bridge has been closed four times due to extreme weather. The first time was September 18, 2003, during Hurricane Isabel and its high winds. On August 27, 2011, the bridge was closed to all traffic due to the impact of Hurricane Irene. Then-Governor Martin O'Malley ordered the bridge closed when sustained winds exceeded . On October 29, 2012, the bridge was closed due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy. On March 6, 2013, during the March 2013 nor'easter, high winds again caused the bridge to be closed. On August 10, 2008, a tractor trailer involved in a head- on collision near the west end fell from the bridge; the driver died in the crash. The incident highlighted concern that the bridge may not be structurally safe, but the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) discounted any structural or engineering problems with it. Inspections of the wall in the weeks following the accident revealed that there was deterioration in the form of corrosion of the steel reinforcements inside barriers; this prompted immediate repairs to the wall. Specifications and operations With shore- to-shore lengths of , the two spans of the bridge form the longest fixed water crossing in Maryland. The bridge's western terminus is in Sandy Point State Park, located northeast of Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, and its eastern terminus is in Stevensville on Kent Island in Queen Anne's County. The two spans are relatively similar in height, with the older span at and the newer span at . =Structural details= With the exception of the number of lanes on each (two on the original span and three on the newer span) and differences owing to the design standards for the periods in which they were built, the spans are structurally similar. Both were designed by J. E. Greiner Company, which later became a part of AECOM through the company's acquisition of URS Corporation. Each span features: *Two main spans over the bay's two shipping channels: **A suspension span over the western channel with a maximum clearance of ‚Äîhigh enough to accommodate ocean-going vessels and tall ships **A through-truss cantilever span over the eastern channel *Deck truss and steel girder spans flanking the main spans *Concrete beam spans on the portions closest to the shores *A curve near the western terminus, which is required so that the main spans cross the bay's shipping channels at 90 degrees per United States Army Corps of Engineers requirements =Traffic control= alt=Electronic signs indicate vehicles are moving the correct direction on the bridge Traffic patterns on the bridge's five lanes can be adjusted via its lane control system, which consists of overhead lane control signals on both spans and approaches. Typically, the two lanes on the south- most span are configured for vehicles traveling east on eastbound US 50/US 301, while the three lanes on the north-most span are configured for vehicles traveling west on westbound US 50/US 301; the spans are therefore referred to as the \\"eastbound span\\" and \\"westbound span\\", respectively. However, this pattern is adjusted during incidents or peak travel times: for instance, on the outset of weekends when there is a high volume of beach-bound traffic, one lane on the westbound span is configured for eastbound traffic. In 2006, pink markers were placed along the eastbound span to mark out the suggested following distance, similar to systems used in Minnesota and Pennsylvania. The markers are a part of the MDTA's \\"Pace Your Space\\" campaign to prevent vehicle collisions and traffic congestion due to tailgating on the bridge. In April 2013, changes were made to increase safety on the westbound span during two- way operations: signs, pavement markings, and rumble strips were modified, and a buffer zone between the left and center lanes was created. As a result, motorists can no longer switch between the left and center lanes, whether or not two-way operations are in effect. Two-way traffic may occur on the eastbound span during overnight roadwork or during emergency situations that close the westbound span, on which two-way traffic is more common. When the MDTA closes either span for overnight roadwork, it implements two-way traffic on the span that remains open. During eastbound span closure, two-way traffic operates on the westbound span with the center lane closed. alt=Tollbooth is removed by a large vehicle using straps In January 2020, Governor Larry Hogan announced that the tollbooths on the eastbound side of bridge were being removed in preparation for all-electronic tolling on the Kent Island side of the eastbound bridge. The merged lanes tie directly into the two lanes on the eastbound bridge. The MDTA is replacing lane control signals on both bridges with those that have flashing strobe lights to indicate a lane closure or a lane with contraflow traffic, and is installing an automated gate system on the bridge to allow quicker implementation of two-way traffic on the bridge. The automated gate system will reduce traffic congestion when implementing two-way traffic. The MDTA has used traffic cones and barrels to open and close crossovers, and to create tapers for the reversible lane. When two-way traffic is implemented, the MDTA momentarily stops traffic to reposition traffic cones and barrels to taper traffic into the reversible lane. MDTA Police then escort traffic across the bridge in the reversible lane. The MDTA will not implement two-way traffic in certain weather conditions, including excess precipitation and high winds. The MDTA may stop all traffic when the wind speed exceeds 55 mph. Two-way traffic on the bridge requires all associated signage and systems to be operational. The MDTA has to monitor two-way traffic operations on the bridge due to the length of the bridge and its lack of shoulders. The MDTA will stop two-way traffic if westbound delays pile up, at which point westbound traffic will be prioritized. Any time contraflow traffic is implemented on either of the bridges, the speed limit for the contraflow lane is reduced to 40 mph while the other lanes remain at 50 mph. MDTA Police will momentarily stop traffic for MDTA crews to reposition traffic cones and barrels to close off the left lane leading up to the bridge in the event of inclement weather during contraflow traffic. =Tolls and fees= Operated by the MDTA, the bridge has a one-way toll (eastbound) of $4.00 for two-axle vehicles; vehicles with a Maryland E-ZPass pay $2.50. Previously the bridge had a one-way (eastbound) toll of $6.00 for two-axle vehicles (raised from $4 on July 1, 2013); vehicles with E-ZPass that were enrolled in the Bay Bridge Commuter Plan paid $2.10 (raised from $1 on July 1, 2013). Tolls were collected in both directions until April 1989, when tolls were doubled and only collected in the Eastbound direction. All-electronic tolling began on May 12, 2020, with tolls payable through E-ZPass or Video Tolling, which uses automatic license plate recognition. The MDTA previously provided transportation across the bridge for nervous drivers, but that role is now filled by private companies. Bay Bridge Walk and Run Governor alt=Larry Hogan and his team move across the bridge as others run behind them While there are no pedestrian facilities on the bridge, the Bay Bridge Walk and Governor's Bay Bridge Run used to afford an opportunity to cross the bridge on foot, usually on the first Sunday in May. The events took place on the eastbound span, which was closed to vehicles while two-way traffic shared the westbound span. Participants started on the east end of the bridge (on Kent Island) and proceeded west to the finish near the toll plaza. WMATA and MTA transit buses transported participants between outlying parking areas and the start and finish points. The run, a 10K race across the bridge, is held early in the morning before the walk. It is conducted by the Annapolis Striders, a local running organization, and controlled by the MDTA and Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Proceeds went to the Chesapeake Bay Trust in support of the bay. The first walk was held in 1975, when a Towson Boy Scout leader asked Governor Marvin Mandel if his troop could walk across the bridge during maintenance. The annual walk was canceled for the first time in 1980 due to poor weather conditions, and later saw frequent cancellations throughout the 2000s. During this period the walk was canceled in: *2002 and 2007 due to poor weather conditions. *2003 and 2005 due to security concerns. *2008, 2009, and 2010 due to construction activity in the area on the west side of the bridge where participants would otherwise be staged. Fiscal concerns were also cited as a contributing factor to the 2010 cancellation. *2011 due to fiscal concerns. *2012 for undisclosed reasons. Following its cancellation in 2005, the MDTA considered decreasing the annual frequency of the event, citing traffic, fiscal, manpower, and security concerns. The most recent event (held in 2006) cost over $350,000, and the cost estimate for 2012 was almost $400,000. In late 2011, a non-profit group, the Greater Washington Sports Alliance (GWSA), approached the MDTA Capital Committee to propose sponsoring the event, along with a concert at Sandy Point State Park, at no cost to the MDTA. While the Capital Committee unanimously recommended that the MDTA Board approve the proposal contingent upon an agreement between the GWSA and the MDTA, the 2012 event was ultimately cancelled. After increasingly consistent cancellations of the walking event, the MDTA, along with Queen Anne's County, contracted with an outside company to have a professional 10K race across the bridge, which has been labeled the \\"Across the Bay 10K\\". The inaugural event occurred November 9, 2014. The Race Director is Dave McGillivray, who has served in that capacity for the BAA Boston Marathon since 1988. The Across the Bay 10K has several charity beneficiaries, including bay research, bay restoration, and breast cancer research. The IRONMAN Foundation took over the race's organization in 2016. In 2019, the race was held virtually due to maintenance on the bridge. Impact alt=Aerial view of houses and large hotels in Ocean City Since its construction, the bridge has made significant impacts on both sides of the bay; among them has been the growth of Eastern Shore communities. When the bridge opened in 1952, and again when the second span was added in 1973, the Eastern Shore was given easier access to Baltimore and Washington, causing areas in southern Queen Anne's County to develop as bedroom communities. This extension of the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington suburbs has led Queen Anne's County to be listed as part of the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Metropolitan Area. The bridge has also given easier access to Ocean City from the Western Shore, which has caused Ocean City to grow from a small town to one that is said to become the second largest city in Maryland during the summer. In 1948, the impending completion of the bridge gave rise to an extension of US 50 to Ocean City. The route was extended along the corridor of Maryland Route 404 (MD 404) and a large portion of US 213, cutting both of those routes back. During the 1950s, US 50 on the Western Shore was rerouted onto the long-proposed Annapolis‚ÄìWashington Expressway (now known as the John Hanson Highway), which was built at the time in order to provide better access to the bridge. As the Eastern Shore, particularly Ocean City, grew, further upgrades and realignments of US 50 took place. This work included the aforementioned 1973 completion of the second Bay Bridge span, the extension of the US 50 freeway eastward to the US 50/US 301 split in Queenstown, and the construction of a freeway bypass around the north side of Salisbury in 2002. Additionally, the road has been upgraded and realigned over the years from its original two-lane configuration to a four-lane divided highway, with the last such section being in Vienna, bypassed in 1991. Previous plans to expand US 50's freeway portion and replace the aging Harry W. Kelley Memorial Bridge into Ocean City have been delayed. The bridge is often the site of suicides by jumpers. As of 1995, more than 75 people had committed suicide during the bridge's 43-year existence. Future expansion alt=High aerial photo of the bridge spans In December 2004, a study concluded that traffic across the bridge was expected to increase by 40% by 2025. The following year, a task force formed by Governor Bob Ehrlich met to again explore the possibility of establishing a new Chesapeake Bay crossing. The task force concluded that a bridge would be the best option for an additional crossing, and four geographic locations for such a bridge were explored: Anne Arundel County to Queen Anne's County (the existing location), Baltimore County to Kent County, Anne Arundel or Calvert County to Talbot County, and Calvert County to Dorchester County. In late 2006, the task force released a report on the study but did not make a final recommendation; members of the task force requested additional time to continue the study. In 2020, it was announced that 11 of 14 potential sites for a third span had been rejected by the Maryland Transportation Authority following a $5 million study into the impacts of an additional span. Significant environmental and economic impacts were identified, with a report stating that any additional crossing is \\"expected to be multiple billions of dollars.\\" See also *Kent Narrows Bridge *List of bridges by length *Severn River Bridge References External links *Chesapeake Bay Bridge official website *Bay Bridge Page at MdTA website *Roads to the Future website *Page at dcroads.net *Live Video Rt 50 Kent Island, Live Video Rt 50 Sandy Point *A 1950 comprehensive study of the economic effects of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (pdf)  1952 establishments in Maryland Bridges completed in 1952 Bridges completed in 1973 Bridges in Anne Arundel County, Maryland Bridges in Queen Anne's County, Maryland Bridges on the United States Numbered Highways Cantilever bridges in the United States Chesapeake Bay Concrete bridges in the United States Girder bridges in the United States Intracoastal Waterway Towers in Maryland Road bridges in Maryland Roads with a reversible lane Steel bridges in the United States Suspension bridges in Maryland Through arch bridges in the United States Toll bridges in Maryland U.S. Route 50 U.S. Route 301 ","title":"Chesapeake Bay Bridge"},{"id":"994431","text":"Chigorin can refer to: * Mikhail Chigorin (1850‚Äì1908), Russian chess player * Chigorin Defense, a chess opening * Chigorin Memorial, a chess tournament * 7268 Chigorin, a minor planet Surnames of Russian origin ","title":"Chigorin"},{"id":"994437","text":"Lake Torrens is a large ephemeral, normally endorheic salt lake in central South Australia. After sufficiently extreme rainfall events, the lake flows out through the Pirie-Torrens corridor to the Spencer Gulf. Description Lake Torrens lies between the Arcoona Plateau to the west and the Flinders Ranges to the east, about north of Port Augusta and about north of the Adelaide city centre. The lake is approximately above sea level,Barker, McCaskill & Ward, p.173, 1995 with a maximum depth of 1 m. It is located within the boundaries of Lake Torrens National Park. Lake Torrens stretches approximately in length and in average width. It is Australia's second largest lake when filled with water and encompasses an area of . Usually the Lake Torrens catchment is an endorheic basin, having no outflow of water to the ocean. History Approximately 35,000 years ago, the lake water was fresh to brackish, but has become increasingly saline since. The traditional owners of the area are the Arabunna peoples to the north, the Kokatha to the west and the Kuyani to the east. In addition, the lake is a sacred site to at least four peoples: the Barngarla, Kokatha, Kuyani and Adnyamathanha peoples. However, the Supreme Court of Australia made a determination in 2016 that none of the groups would be awarded native title to the area, as it was not possible to know which, if any, had ownership before colonisation of the area, despite the fact that the Kokatha previously had native title. The first European to see the lake was Edward Eyre in 1839, who spotted the salt bed from Mount Arden at the head of the Spencer Gulf. Eyre named the lake after Colonel Robert TorrensPlaceNames Online - South Australian State Gazetteer Site is a searchable database. Accessed 3 April 2012. who was one of the founders of the colony of South Australia. However the Kuyani people had long called the lake Ngarndamukia, meaning \\"shower of rain\\". The lake filled in 1897 and again in April 1989. The 1989 filling resulted in the lake outflowing through the Pirie-Torrens corridor to the Spencer Gulf, suggesting it likely did so in 1897 as well. It has a thin salt crust with red-brown clays beneath, which are soft and boggy. The area around the lake is sparsely vegetated with samphire, saltbush and bluebush. In April 2013, the full extent of Lake Torrens was gazetted by the Government of South Australia as a locality with the name Lake Torrens. Protected area status =South Australian government= The full extent of Lake Torrens has been protected as a national park under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 since 1991. =Non- statutory arrangements= Lake Torrens is part of an area known as the Inland Saline Lakes which has been listed in the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia since at least 1995. Lake Torrens has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area known as the Lake Torrens Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supported up to 100,000 breeding banded stilts during the major filling event of 1989. It may occasionally support over 1% of the world population of red-capped plovers. Cinnamon quail-thrushes are also common in the IBA. Exploratory drilling for minerals In April 2017 Kelaray, a subsidiary of mining company Argonaut Resources, secured native title permission to do exploratory drilling for iron, copper and gold under the lake, intending to work traditional owners to ‚Äúpreserve and protect‚Äù important sites. The area was drilled in 2007 to 2008 without obtaining permission of the Kokatha people, who then held native title (see History, above). Some drilling was done in 2019, but was paused pending a technical review relating to the aquifer below the lake. In September 2020, representatives of the local Kuyani and Kokatha people raised concerns about further drilling proposals.

He is the son of Weohstan, a Swede of the W√¶gmunding clan who had entered the service of Beowulf, king of the Geats. Wiglaf is called Scylfing as a metonym for Swede, as the Scylfings were the ruling Swedish clan. While in the service of the Scylfing Onela, king of the Swedes, Weohstan killed the rebel prince Eanmund and took his sword as a trophy;Lines 2612-5. Wiglaf later inherited it.Lines 2620-4.

At Beowulf's command, Wiglaf gathers treasure from the dragon's lair and piles it where Beowulf can see it.Lines 2752-82.

Wiglaf's last appearance is at line 3120, where he chooses seven thanes to help him push the dragon's corpse over the cliff into the sea, loot the lair, and lay the treasure on Beowulf's funeral pyre.Lines 3120-36. Etymological significance An apparent example of etymological refraction can be found within Beowulf through Wiglaf's name. When he first enters battle alongside his lord the poet structures the words of the poem in such a way that reflect greater significance of Wiglaf's name. The separation and reversal and elements of the name within the manuscript form of Beowulf suggest that the name Wiglaf signifies being the inheritor of strength or being one that is fulfilled through battle according to Dr. Patrick J. Gallacher and Dr. Helen Damico at the University of New Mexico. Wiglaf is able to be divided in this way because it is a Germanic dithematic name. The elements combined are wig (fight, battle, war etc.) and laf (what or who is left). An alternate understanding of the name in the context of a typical dithematic name, where the two elements may be as independent in meaning as separate names, \\"laf\\" could be read as \\"one who remains, one who survives or endures\\". Gallacher and Damico have acknowledged this alternative interpretation but feel that it is unnecessary to argue that one discernible element within a name submerges another as all interpretations are collectively useful in the pursuit of deep analysis. Cultural references In the 1981 animated film Grendel Grendel Grendel, Wiglaf (voiced by Ernie Bourne) is portrayed as one of Hrothgar's thanes rather than an ally of Beowulf, and is killed by Grendel. In the 2007 film Beowulf (directed by Robert Zemeckis), Wiglaf's role (played by Brendan Gleeson) is larger; he is present in the film from the first introduction of Beowulf and the Geats to the end when Beowulf vanquishes the dragon and dies. The film makes Wiglaf into a sidekick, the second-in-command and the best friend of the epic hero. In the 2018 Harry Potter fan-made film Voldemort: Origins of the Heir, the descendant of Rowena Ravenclaw is named Wiglaf Sigurdsson.

As a teenager he fought in the Chaco War between Paraguay and Bolivia, and he later worked as a journalist, screenwriter and professor. He is best known for his complex novel Yo el Supremo (I, the Supreme) and for winning the Premio Miguel de Cervantes in 1989, Spanish literature's most prestigious prize. Yo el Supremo explores the dictations and inner thoughts of Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia, the eccentric dictator of Paraguay who ruled with an iron fist, from 1814 until his death in 1840. Roa Bastos' life and writing were marked by experience with dictatorial military regimes. In 1947 he was forced into exile in Argentina, and in 1976 he fled Buenos Aires for France in similar political circumstances. Most of Roa Bastos' work was written in exile, but this did not deter him from fiercely tackling Paraguayan social and historical issues in his work. Writing in a Spanish that was at times heavily augmented by Guaran√≠ words (the major Paraguayan indigenous language), Roa Bastos incorporated Paraguayan myths and symbols into a Baroque style known as magical realism. He is considered a late-comer to the Latin American Boom literary movement. Roa Bastos' canon includes the novels Hijo de hombre (1960; Son of Man) and El fiscal (1993; The Prosecutor), as well as numerous other novels, short stories, poems, and screenplays.  Biography  = Early life (1917‚Äì1932) = Roa Bastos was born in Asunci√≥n on June 13, 1917. He spent his childhood in Iturbe, a provincial town in the Guaira region where his father was an administrator on a sugar plantation. It was here, some to the south of the Paraguayan capital of Asunci√≥n, that Roa Bastos learned to speak both Spanish and Guaran√≠, the language of Paraguay's indigenous people. At the age of ten he was sent to school in Asunci√≥n where he stayed with his uncle, Hermenegildo Roa, the liberal bishop of Asunci√≥n. His uncle's extensive personal library provided the young Roa Bastos with his first exposure to the classical Spanish literature of the Baroque and Renaissance traditions that he would imitate in his early poetry throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In addition, his uncle's emphasis on the mystical aspects of classic literature would have a profound Roa Bastos' later writings. His experience of Guaran√≠ social customs and language combined with the traditional Spanish education that he received in Asunci√≥n, created a cultural and linguistic duality that would manifest itself in much of Roa Bastos' writing. His rural upbringing also exposed Roa Bastos to the exploitation and oppression of the indigenous and peasant peoples of Paraguay, which would become a prominent theme in his writing. = War and writing (1932‚Äì1947) = In 1932 the territorial Chaco War began between Paraguay and Bolivia and continued until 1935. At some point, perhaps as late as 1934, Roa Bastos joined the Paraguayan army as a medical auxiliary. The war would have a profound effect on the future writer who said: \\"when I left for that war I dreamed of purification in the fire of battles.\\" Instead of glory he found \\"maimed bodies\\" and \\"destruction\\" which left him to question \\"why two brother countries like Bolivia and Paraguay were massacring each other\\", and as a consequence Roa Bastos became a pacifist. Directly after the war he worked as a bank clerk and later as a journalist. During this time he began writing plays and poetry. In 1941 Roa Bastos won the Ateneo Paraguayo prize for Fulgencia Miranda, although the book was never published. In the early 1940s he spent significant time on the yerba mate plantations in northern Paraguay, an experience he would later draw upon in his first published novel, Hijo de hombre (1960; Son of Man). In 1942 he was appointed editorial secretary for the Asunci√≥n daily El Pa√≠s. In 1944 the British Council awarded Roa Bastos a nine-month fellowship for journalism in London. During this time he traveled extensively in Britain, France and Africa and witnessed the devastation of WWII first hand. He served as the El Pa√≠s war correspondent, notably conducting an interview with General Charles de Gaulle after the latter's return to Paris in 1945. Roa Bastos also broadcast Latin American programs at the invitation of the BBC and France's Ministry of Information. Throughout this eventful period in his life Roa Bastos continued to write and he was considered a poet of the Paraguayan avant garde. In 1942 he published a book of poems in the classic Spanish style, which he titled El Ruise√±or De La Aurora (The Dawn Nightingale), a work he later renounced. He also had plays successfully performed during the 1940s, though they were never published. Of his prolific poetry of the late 1940s only \\"El naranjal ardiente\\" (1960; \\"The Burning Orange Grove\\") was published. = Exile in Argentina (1947‚Äì1976) = During the 1947 Paraguayan Civil War, Roa Bastos was forced to flee to Buenos Aires, Argentina, because he had spoken out against President Higinio Mor√≠√±igo. About 500,000 of his fellow Paraguayans left for Argentina at the same time. Roa Bastos remained in Argentina until just before the establishment of the military dictatorship there in 1976, and he did not return permanently to Paraguay until 1989. He found exile difficult, but his time in Buenos Aires was a prolific period. Roa Bastos said this in reference to his exile: > I can't complain...Exile brought out in me, in addition to a revulsion > against violence and against depreciation of the human condition, a feeling > for the universality of man. Exile lent me perspectives from which to know > my own country from other people's point of view, and from which to live for > the enormity of its misfortune. In 1953 the collection of 17 short stories El trueno entre las hojas (1953; Thunder Among the Leaves) was published and circulated internationally, but it was not until the 1960 publication of the novel Hijo de hombre (Son of Man) that Roa Bastos won major critical and popular success. The novel draws on the oppressive history of Paraguay from the rule of Dr. Jose Gaspar de Francia in the early 19th century until the Chaco War in the 1930s. Its multiple narrative perspectives and historical and political themes anticipate his most famous work, Yo, el Supremo, written more than a decade later. Roa Bastos adapted Hijo de hombre into an award-winning film in the same year as its publication. Roa Bastos further established himself as a screenwriter with the screenplay of Shunko (1960), directed by Lautaro Mur√∫a and based on the memoirs of a country school teacher. In 1961 he once again collaborated with Mur√∫a for Alias Gardelito (1961), which depicted the lives of urban petty criminals and became a major independent film of the nuevo cine movement. In 1974 Roa Bastos published his influential masterpiece Yo, el Supremo, the result of seven years' work. When Jorge Rafael Videla's military dictatorship came to power in 1976, however, the book was banned in Argentina, and Roa Bastos was exiled once again, this time to Toulouse, France. = France (1976‚Äì1989) = In Toulouse Roa Bastos taught Guaran√≠ and Spanish literature at the University of Toulouse. Although he had been allowed to visit Paraguay to work with a new generation of Paraguayan writers, starting in 1970, he was again barred from entry in 1982, for purportedly engaging in subversive activities. There is however, little evidence that he participated in sectarian politics of any kind. In France, Roa Bastos faced the second forced relocation of his life, but he also won a new readership for his work during this time. Helen Lane's English translation of Yo, el Supremo, I, The Supreme, published in 1986, was greeted with widespread acclaim in the English-speaking world. However, in France, Roa Bastos' writing focus was primarily academic, and his literary output did not match that of his time in Argentina. In 1985 Roa Bastos left his post at the University of Toulouse. Following the downfall of the oppressive Alfredo Stroessner regime in 1989, Roa Bastos returned to Paraguay at the request of its new leader Andr√©s Rodr√≠guez. = Return to Paraguay and Cervantes Prize (1989‚Äì2005) = Following the toppling of the Stroessner regime, Roa Bastos won the Premio Cervantes (Cervantes Prize), awarded by the Spanish Royal Academy in partnership with the Spanish government, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to Spanish- language literature. It was at this time that Roa Bastos began to travel frequently between Paraguay and France. In 1991, representing Paraguay, Roa Bastos signed The Morelia Declaration \\"demanding the reversal of the ecological destruction of the planet.\\" It was at this time that Roa Bastos again became an active novelist and screenwriter. In 1991 Roa Bastos adapted Yo, el Supremo for the screen. His first novel since Yo, el Supremo, Vigilia del admirante (1992; Vigil of the Admiral) was published in 1992, and El fiscal (1993; The Prosecutor) the following year. Although neither of his later novels had the impact of his earlier work, El fiscal is considered an important work. Roa Bastos died on April 26, 2005 in Asunci√≥n from a heart attack. He was survived by his three children, his third wife, Iris Gim√©nez, and a reputation as one of Latin American's finest writers.  Major works  = Hijo de hombre = Hijo de hombre (1960; Son of Man), Roa Bastos' first published and award-winning novel, represents his definitive break with poetry. It is seen as a refined \\"outgrowth\\" of his earlier works of short fiction such as El trueno entre las hojas (1953), which also dealt with themes of political oppression and social struggle in Paraguay. This novel portrays the conflict between the governing √©lite and the oppressed masses in Paraguay from 1912 until just after the end of the Chaco War with Bolivia in 1936. Like his later Yo, el Supremo, Hijo de hombre draws upon a series of Paraguayan legends and stories dating back to start of Dr. Francia's dictatorship in 1814. Hijo de hombre builds upon a system of Christian metaphors as part of the Neobaroque concept of Magic Realism, in order to examine the pain of being Paraguayan. This novel contrasts two figures: Miguel Vera and Crist√≥bal Jara. Vera narrates the odd chapters, although he might also be the narrator of all nine chapters (this is unclear). He is a well-to-do and educated romantic supporter of revolution, who is unable to take real action to support his ideals and in the end betrays them (not unlike Judas). Jara, on the other hand, is an uneducated \\"son of man\\" who becomes a Christ-like leader for Paraguayan people through action and strength of character. Although it was a massive critical success, Roa Bastos remained dissatisfied with the work for a number reasons. It was fourteen years before he published another novel. = Yo, el Supremo = Roa Bastos portrayed the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia in his novel Yo, el Supremo. Yo, el Supremo (I, the Supreme) is a fictionalized account of the 19th-century Paraguayan dictator Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia, who was also known as \\"Dr. Francia\\". The book's title derives from the fact that Francia referred to himself as \\"El Supremo\\" or \\"The Supreme.\\" The first in a long line of dictators, The Supreme was a severe, calculating despot. He ruled absolutely from 1814 until his death in 1840, and is a unique figure in Latin American history. The goal of his rule mirrored that of the Jesuits who had ruled Paraguay for much of its history before him: to keep the Paraguayan people and their customs pure by protecting them from the corrupting influence of European and other outside forces. In Yo, el supremo, Roa Bastos is also fundamentally concerned with the power (and the weakness) of writing itself: its plot revolves around the dictator's efforts to uncover who has been forging his signature on a series of pasquinades discovered around the capital, and his relationship with his secretary, Pati√±o, to whom he dictates his thoughts and orders, but whom he never fully trusts. The novel itself is \\"an exceptional cultural phenomenon.\\" It has been suggested that it \\"[is] more immediately and unanimously acclaimed than any novel since One Hundred Years of Solitude, [and the] strictly historical importance [may] be even greater than that of Garc√≠a M√°rquez's fabulously successful creation.\\" Yo, el supremo has contributed widely to a number of different genres and styles. It belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Yo, el supremo is also an important milestone in the evolution of the historical novel genre. \\"Yo, el supremo weaves a plethora of formats into a single work: history, novel, sociological essay, moral philosophy, biographical novel, revolutionary pamphlet, testimonial documentary, poetic prose, autobiographic confession, ideological debate over literary limits, and linguistic treatise on the limits of verbal expression.\\"  Precursors and influences  Ruy D√≠az de Guzm√°n's Anales del descubrimiento, poblaci√≥n y conquista del R√≠o de la Plata, is considered one of the most important antecedents to Roa Bastos' writings. Guzm√°n, a Paraguayan explorer of Guaran√≠ and Spanish heritage, wrote extensively about the geography of Paraguay using mythical descriptions of the landscape and the Guaran√≠ language. The most important precursor to Roa Bastos, however, is Rafael Barrett (1876‚Äì1910), whose writings incorporated many of the important themes and writings styles that Roa Bastos would later master including: Spanish-Guaran√≠ bilingualism, magic realism, the revision of Paraguayan history, social literature, exploration of collective memory and the universe of poetic symbols. Barrett's essay \\"Lo que son los yerbales\\" is a severe critique of the exploitation of workers on yerba mate tea plantations. Roa Bastos spent part of the early 1940s documenting this same issue and there is much speculation about the role of \\"Lo que son los yerbales\\" in the creation of his first major novel Hijo de hombre. The Uruguayan writer Horacio Quiroga is another important predecessor.  Style  Roa Bastos was an exponent of the Neobaroque style that brought Latin American literature to the fore internationally in the mid-20th century. Among others, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda is also associated with this school of writing. The style uses a complex system of metaphors that are often very closely tied to the land, flora and culture of the particular writer, especially in the case of Roa Bastos. Magic realism is a Neobaroque concept that applies such systems of metaphor to otherwise realistic settings (Yo, el Supremo being a notable example of the form). The Neobaroque style was used by many Paraguayan writers in exile after 1947 and until the 1980s. At the core of much of the work from this group are ideas of political freedom and the emancipation of their homeland. Roa Bastos started out writing poetry in the Spanish Renaissance and Baroque traditions. Later he took on \\"a new sensibility\\" in response to the poetry of Valle-Incl√°n, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, and Garc√≠a Lorca. However, it is as a prose-fiction writer Roa Bastos has built his considerable reputation, through his novels and numerous short stories. Roa Bastos' novels blend the present and past by creating scenes with myths from pre-colonial times and Christian legends, developing a special kind of Magic Realism, although there are significant stylistic variations between his major novels.  Themes  = Paraguay: collective memory = The majority of Roa Bastos' work was written in exile owing to the oppressive political condition of his country, at a time when Paraguay was one of the least culturally, economically, and politically developed countries in Latin America. Thus, much of Roa Bastos' important writing is an attempt to \\"capture the tragic essence, the 'inner weakness' as well as the inner strength of his country's people.\\" His work reveals an intense preoccupation not only with contemporary Paraguay but with its history, looking back to the beginning of the 19th century and the rule of Dr. Gaspar de Francia (whose life is the focus of Yo, el Supremo). While key historical figures and events interest Roa Bastos, it is the impact of these \\"socio-historical roots\\" on \\"the nature of the masses\\" that forms the central theme of his literary work. His writing deploys symbols and multiple narratives that build on the collective memory of the Paraguayan people. Hijo de hombre, for example, constructs an \\"alternative history of popular movements\\" out of the people's recollections and symbols. The intertextual novel Yo, el Supremo is particularly representative of this technique, both in its construction and narrative. In El Fiscal (1993), a third novel about the abuses of political power‚Äîthis time focusing on Stroessner's r√©gime‚ÄîRoa Bastos again offers an alternative to the accepted versions of events in Paraguay and challenges \\"the intelligibility of history\\". To this end he weaves elements of fantasy and metafiction into his narratives. = Humanism and the engaged writer = Roa Bastos believed that it was the role of the writer to directly engage in the interpretation of both contemporary and historical events. Rather than be the objective \\"chronicler\\", he thought the writer should engage morally with the social problems depicted in the writing. According to Roa Bastos, ‚Äùliterary activity has come to signify the necessity for facing up to a destiny, the will to enlist in the vital reality of a collectivity, in its true moral context and social structure, in the complex relationships of a contemporary reality ‚Äì that is to say, by projecting themselves toward a universal world of man.‚Äù Thus, one of the major themes in the writing of Roa Bastos is a deep and universal humanism, with a particular focus on suffering Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own experiences played a significant role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in Hijo de hombre. Later he saw the devastation of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El Trueno entre las Hojas, set the stage for Hijo de hombre and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre. = Bilingualism = As is customary for most Paraguayans of peasant or working class origins, Roa Bastos learned to speak Spanish and Guaran√≠ from birth. Both Spanish and Guaran√≠ are the official languages of Paraguay (the latter is primarily an oral language). Although Guaran√≠ remains the \\"popular\\" language spoken at home and on the \\"street\\", Spanish is the language of official business and of power. The preservation and widespread use of an indigenous language after centuries of European immigration is unique in Latin America, and Guarani remains a symbol of Paraguayan nationalism and an \\"important vehicle for interpreting the country's reality\\". This is the legacy of the Jesuits who ruled Paraguay in the 18th century and used Guarani (instead of Spanish or Latin) to spread Christianity throughout Paraguay. While Roa Bastos wrote primarily in Spanish, the interplay between these two languages is an essential part of his style. His bilingualism gives Roa Bastos a much greater range of language to work with, but also creates tension between an internationally recognized language and one that is obscure and fiercely Paraguayan. Roa Bastos has described the relationship between the two languages as \\"an almost schizophrenic split not only on communicational levels of the spoken language, but also and quite particularly in the literary language.\\"  Honors and distinctions  Over the course of his career, Roa Bastos received a diversity of honors and distinctions. In 1941 he won the Ateneo Paraguayo Prize for his (unpublished) novel Fulgencio Miranda. This first award was followed by a British Council fellowship for journalism that enabled him to travel to Europe during World War II. In 1959 Roa Bastos won the Losada prize for his first published novel Hijo de hombre. The adaptation of this novel, for which he wrote the screenplay, won best film in the Spanish language and first prize of the Argentine Instituto de Cinematografia the following year. His most prestigious awards were a 1971 John Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship for creative writers, and in 1989, the Cervantes Prize, an award given by the Spanish government for lifetime achievement, and Spanish language literature's most prestigious prize. Roa Bastos donated most of his prize money to provide easier access to books in Paraguay. In 1997 France distinguished him as Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur.  Legacy  The writing of Roa Bastos spans four countries, six decades, and countless genres. In his lifetime he made important contributions to Latin American Boom writing, to the related Dictator Novel, and to the Nuevo Cine film movement through screenplays like Alias Gardelito (1961). Roa Bastos' influence can be found in the works of many foreign post-boom writers, including Mempo Giardinelli, Isabel Allende, Eraclio Zepeda, Antonio Sk√°rmeta, Saul Ibargoyen, and Luisa Valenzuela. The most important author to come out of Paraguay, he also remains highly influential for a new generation of Paraguayan authors. Roa Bastos' relationship with his country, unbroken by over 40 years of exile, was considered so important that in 1989 he was invited back by Paraguay's new president, Andr√©s Rodr√≠guez, following the collapse of the Stroessner regime. Even before Yo, el Supremo, Roa Bastos was considered part of \\"the pantheon of great writers\\" by some critics, due to Hijo de hombre. However, it was the former work that cemented his place as a significant literary figure. According to Juan Manuel Marcos, Yo, el Supremo \\"anticipates many of the post- boom writing techniques\\" such as \\"the carnivalization of historical discourse, transtextualization, and parody\\". Mexican literary great, Carlos Fuentes has called Yo, el Supremo one of the milestones in Latin American literature. While his reputation rests on his novels, Roa Bastos' achievements in film, creative writing, and journalism add further substance to his legacy.

He also identified one or possibly two blue stragglers. These are unexpectedly hot and luminous stars that appear younger than surrounding stars, and have likely developed by sucking matter off companion stars.

It is a historic area of commerce and culture administratively within Xuhui District, which is named after the locality. The area is a well-known precinct for shopping and entertainment in Shanghai. It is served by the Xujiahui Station of the Shanghai Metro.  Name  The tomb of Xu Guangqi in Xujiahui, Shanghai. Xujiahui means \\"Xu family junction\\" - more precisely, \\"property of Xu family at the junction of two rivers\\". The \\"Xu family\\" refers to the family of Xu Guangqi (Hs√º Kuang-ch'i; 1562‚Äì1633), China's most notable Catholic convert. Most of what is now Xujiahui was once the ancestral home of the Xu family. Baptized by famed Italian Jesuit, Matteo Ricci, Xu Guangqi and his descendants donated large plots of land to the Catholic Church, including the site of the St. Ignatius Cathedral. St. Ignatius Cathedral, Xujiahui, Shanghai. Pronounced in the Shanghainese dialect of Wu Chinese, it is called \\"zi-ga-wei\\". During the 18th century it was known by Shanghai's western residents as \\"Ziccawei\\" or \\"Siccawei\\" (English) or \\"Zikawei\\" or \\"Zi-ka-wei\\" (French). These names survive in the names of some institutions, such as the Bibliotheca Zi-Ka-Wei, and the area is still listed in a number of contemporary guidebooks and literature as \\"Zikawei\\" or some variant thereof.  History  A river scene, with the mission and observatory, caption reads (in German): \\"Jesuiten Kloster mit Meteorolog. Observatorium in Zi-ca-wei bei Shanghai\\" The Siccawei Observatory, c. 1908 The former site of the Siccawei Observatory is now a part of the Shanghai Meteorological Center The former Site of Path√© Petain Apartments With land donated by Xu Guangqi's family and those acquired by other means, the Society of Jesus established a grand cathedral as well as an entire one square mile complex that covers most of present-day Xujiahui. In addition to the cathedral, the French Jesuits also built orphanages, monasteries, schools, libraries and the (now the Shanghai Bureau of Meteorology). In time, it became a stronghold of Catholics in East Asia. One of the first structures to be built by the Jesuits was the St. Ignatius Cathedral in 1847, later reconstructed in 1906. The Cathedral is located on what is now known as North Caoxi Road and is still referred to in English as the St. Ignatius Cathedral. The sign on the street calls it simply \\"Catholic Church.\\" The cathedral was featured in the opening scenes of Steven Spielberg's 1987 film Empire of the Sun. The Bibliotheca Zikawei, now a branch of the Shanghai Library. A number of other structures survive from its days as a center of Catholicism. One is the Coll√®ge Saint Ignace or Xuhui College on 68 Hongqiao Road, now renamed Xuhui High School (or Xuhui Middle School). Established by Jesuits in 1850, Xuhui (St. Ignatius) College was the first educational institution in China to offer a fully western curriculum. Another is the Bibliotheca Zikawei (or Bibliotheque de Mission), now a branch of Shanghai Library, adjacent to the cathedral. Several of the convent buildings scattered around Xujiahui are still visible in various states of preservation: one (structurally modified but still recognizable) serves as the office of the Xuhui District Government and People's Procurate. The Tou-Se-We Orphanage (Mandarin: Tushanwan) operated by the church, whose workshops supplied much of the religious art on Xujiahui's religious buildings, is half a mile to the south of Xujiahui junction; the sole surviving building of the orphanage is now the Tou-Se-We Museum. The educational institutions founded by the Catholic church led to Xujiahui's reputation as a center of education. The Aurora University was founded by the Jesuits in Xujiahui. The imperial Nanyang Public School system was founded in Xujiahui at the end of the 19th century, and the historic main campus of its most prominent descendent school, Jiao Tong University, one of Shanghai's most prestigious, is still located in Xujiahui. Fudan University, also one of Shanghai's most prestigious, was located in Xujiahui until 1922. While central Xujiahui was administratively part of the Chinese area of Shanghai, it was in reality controlled by the Catholic Church, which was closely associated with the French authorities of the French Concession. From 1914, Xujiahui sat just outside the borders of the French Concession, and remained under heavy French influence. Catholic Xujiahui came to an abrupt end with the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. A few years after the People's Liberation Army entered Shanghai, the Jesuits abandoned Xujiahui and relocated to nearby posts such as Macau or Manila. Many of those who remained were imprisoned by Communist authorities. These include Cardinal Ignatius Kung, who spent decades in prison, and Father Chang-min \\"Beda\\" Chang, who died in prison in November 1951. Xujiahui junction at night From 1949 onwards, most of the large houses and estates in Xujiahui were compulsarily acquired or seized by the government and converted into factories. Up until the late 1990s, the area was predominantly an industrial area. Grand Gateway at Xujiahui Circle During the late 1990s, many of the state-owned factories were sold off and torn down. Xujiahui is now mainly a retail district of downtown Shanghai.  Economy  Xujiahui today is mainly a commercial area, though the Catholic church retains a significant presence and there are still educational and scientific institutions in the area. The main Xujiahui shopping district is centered on the intersection of the streets Hongqiao Rd, Huashan Rd, Zhaojiabang Rd and North Caoxi Rd. Each of these streets terminates at the intersection, which is home to three supermarkets, six major shopping malls and nine large-scale office towers. (Clockwise from Hongqiao Road, Grand Gateway, Huashan Road, Pacific Sogo, Hengshan Road Tunnel, Huijin Department Store, Zhaojiabang Road, Metro-City, North Caoxi Road, Oriental Shopping Mall.) Everything from cosmetics to cars to cucumbers is available within five minutes, but the type of product that Xujiahui is most famous for is electronics. It is one of the biggest places for people to get electronic equipment, from cameras to PSPs to Xboxes and modchips for those Xboxes and other game consoles as well. However, the biggest shopping mall for electronic equipment has closed in 2016. Currently, a brand new shopping center is under construction, it is located on Hongqiao Road, right beside the Grand Gateway. The new shopping center will officially open in 2016. Education The historic main campus of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University is located in Xujiahui, to the north of the Xujiahui junction. While due to space limitations the university has moved its undergraduate department to a new campus on the outskirts of Shanghai, the Xujiahui campus still houses the university's School of International Education and several research institutes. The campus is notable for a number of historic buildings dating from the early 20th century, including its imperial-style gate and remnants of the imperial-style marble bridges, reflecting the university's former status as the Imperial Polytechnic. The former Coll√®ge Saint Ignace, founded in 1850 and now Xuhui High School, is still in Xujiahui. The former Shanghai Medical University, now Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, is located close to Xujiahui metro station. The Bibliotheca Zi-Ka-Wei (Xujiahui Library) is in the area. Parks On the location of a former brick factory now stands the Xujiahui park, which was completed in 2002. The park also contains a manmade meandering brook (miniature model of the course of the Huangpu River), basketball courts, and a children's playground. The park is traversed by a roughly 250 meter (820 feet)-long elevated pathway. The eastern part of the park features the historic Red House, which once housed the Path√© China record company. The Shanghai Conservatory of Music - also located in Xuhui district - often stages free performances during the Spring and Autumn months in the park, as these are the times when weather in Shanghai is the best. The other notable park in Xujiahui is Guangqi Park, which features the tomb of Xu Guangqi, after whom the area and district are ultimately named. The tomb, recently restored according to its original set-up, is a curious combination of a large Christian cross as the grave marker, with a traditional Chinese \\"spirit way\\" lined with stone animals. Also located in the park is a traditional house relocated here as a result of urban redevelopment elsewhere in the district.  Transportation  The main intersection at Xujiahui is a transportation hub. It is served by dozens of bus routes, and by the Xujiahui metro station on Lines 1, 9 and 11 of the Shanghai Metro.  Xujiahui Subdistrict  Xujiahui Subdistrict was established in May 1994 as a subdistrict of Xuhui District, Shanghai. The subdistrict covers . There are 31,624 households which total 94,872 residents. There are roughly 110,000 permanent residents in the district. The subdistrict is not co-extensive with the geographical locality.

It prevented system overloads by monitoring call center traffic and prioritizing tasks on phone switching systems to enable more robust service during peak calling times. At Bell Laboratories where she worked for over 32 years, Hoover was described as an important pioneer for women in the field of computer technology. Early life Erna Schneider was born on June 19, 1926, in Irvington, New Jersey. Her family lived in South Orange, New Jersey and her father was a dentist and her mother was a teacher. She had a younger brother who died from polio at the age of five. She loved swimming, sailing, canoeing, and was interested in science at an early age. According to one source, she read the biography of Marie Curie which suggested to her that she could succeed in a scientific field despite the prevailing ideas about gender roles at the time. She graduated from Columbia High School in nearby Maplewood in 1944, which would later induct her into its hall of fame in 2007.Hall of Fame , Columbia High School. Accessed November 12, 2018. Hoover attended Wellesley College where she studied classical and medieval philosophy and history. She graduated from Wellesley in 1948 with honors, earning a bachelor's degree, and she was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa and was honored as a Durant Scholar. She earned her Ph.D from Yale University in philosophy and foundations of mathematics in 1951. Career Hoover was a professor at Swarthmore College from 1951 to 1954 where she taught philosophy and logic. However, she had been unable to win a tenure-track position, possibly because of her gender and marital status, according to one view. In 1953, she married Charles Wilson Hoover, Jr., and he was very supportive of his wife's career pursuits. In 1954, she joined Bell Labs as a senior technical associate, and was promoted in 1956. According to one source, the internal training program was the \\"equivalent of a master's degree in computer science.\\" Switching systems were moving from electronic to computer-based technologies. Problems happened when a call center would be inundated with thousands of calls in a short amount of time, overwhelming the unreliable electronic relays, and causing the entire system to \\"freeze up.\\" Hoover used her knowledge of symbolic logic and feedback theory to program the control mechanisms of a call center to use data about incoming calls to impose order on the whole system. It used computer electronic methods to monitor the frequency of incoming calls at different times. Her method gave priority to processes that were concerned with the input and output of the switch over processes that were less important such as record keeping and billing. The computer, as a result, would adjust the call center's acceptance rate automatically, greatly reducing the overloading problem. The system became known as stored program control. Hoover's thinking about the invention happened while she was in a hospital recuperating after having given birth to her second daughter, according to several sources. Lawyers for Bell Labs handling the patent had to go to her house to visit her while she was on maternity leave so that she could sign the papers. The result of the invention was much more robust service to callers during peak load times: The College of New Jersey, she was instrumental in its efforts to attract the state's best students, hire women faculty, and win more state aid. For her invention, termed Feedback Control Monitor for Stored Program Data Processing System, Hoover was awarded patent #3,623,007 in November 1971, one of the first software patents ever issued. The patent was applied for in 1967 and issued in 1971.See Patent #3623007 November 23, 1971 As a result of her invention, she became the first woman supervisor of a technical department at Bell Labs. She headed the operations support department in 1987. The principles of her invention are still being used in telecommunications equipment in the 21st century. Hoover worked on various high-level applications such as research radar control programs of the Safeguard Anti- Ballistic Missile System, which were systems to intercept incoming intercontinental ballistic missile warheads. Her department worked on artificial intelligence methods, large databases, and transactional software to support large telephone networks. She worked at Bell Labs for 32 years until retiring in 1987. In addition, she served on the boards of higher education organizations in New Jersey. As a member of the board of Trustees of The College of New Jersey, she was described as a visionary who was instrumental in increasing women faculty as well as enrolling the \\"best prepared high school graduates\\" in the state, and she helped build the college into a respected institution of higher education by lobbying extensively for state funding. Awards She was awarded one of the first patents for computer software. She was elected as a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008. She received the Wellesley College alumni achievement award.

The village is north of Leeds city centre and it is in the LS16 Leeds postcode area. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 3,400. The population had increased to 3,533 at the 2011 Census. It is predominantly made up of large, privately owned houses which tend to be above the average value for properties in West Yorkshire. Bramhope sits in the Leeds North West constituency and the Adel & Wharfedale ward of Leeds City Council. Etymology The place-name Bramhope appears first in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Brahop and Bramhop, with later medieval spellings including Bramhop(a) and Bramhop(p)e. The name seems to derive from the Old English words br≈çm 'broom' and h≈çp 'a small valley, side-valley off a larger valley', here referring to a small valley off Wharfedale,Victor Watts (ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names, Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v. BRAMHOPE. probably the one through which flows Bramhope Beck.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Name Society, 2017), p. 27.  History  Town well The earliest known settlement in the area was a British camp established off Moor Road. The Romans built a road through the area from Adel to Ilkley, traces of which remain in a field near Leeds Bradford Airport. In 1086, Bramhope was the manor of an Anglo-Saxon thegn, Uchill. In 1095 the manor passed to the Percy family, and in 1165 was sold to Ralph de Bramhope. In the 13th century the monasteries owned much of the land and had granges where sheep were grazed. The monks used tracks, such as Scotland Lane and Staircase Lane, as they travelled from their outlying granges to Kirkstall Abbey. The village had a small population until the 20th century. The Black Death of 1348-09 reduced the number of adults to 34, but this gradually increased to about 400 in 1900. Now it is approximately 3,400. Water was drawn from private wells or the town well at the foot of Northgate (now Church Hill). The town well was restored in 1991 by the Bramhope History Group, and is located opposite St Giles' Church. The plaque says that the well was exposed in 1991, so perhaps it had been lost for some time.  Churches  Puritan Chapel, 1649 At the Dissolution of the Monasteries Henry VIII gave the land to the Earl of Cumberland. In the 16th century the Dyneley family moved into the area and acquired Bramhope Hall. In 1649 they built the Puritan Chapel, which was taken over by the Church of England after the Restoration. The chapel is one of only a few built during the Commonwealth period. It is said not to have been consecrated but nevertheless was regularly used for church services until 1881-82. The Puritan Chapel was listed Grade I in 1966. When the chapel proved too small for the growing population, St Giles' Church was built in 1881. The original Methodist chapel was built in 1837 and replaced by the much bigger church in 1896. There is a map showing the location of St Giles and the Methodist church here. Bramhope Cemetery, established in 1861, is in Moor Road, but there are still some historical gravestones remaining in the cemetery of the Puritan Chapel.  Road and railway  Milestone near St Giles' Church For many centuries travellers to the market towns in the vicinity used Otley Old Road. However, it was the Leeds to Otley turnpike road, with its tollhouses, opened in 1842, which routed travellers through the outskirts of Bramhope. It is along this route that motorists today travel between Leeds and the northwest. The milestones along the road were erected in 1850. The railway was excavated under the village through the Bramhope Tunnel constructed between 1845 and 1849. The tunnel has an elaborate castellated northern entrance and there are many heaps of spoil and several ventilation shafts along its length. There is a replica of the tunnel entrance in Otley churchyard, erected as a memorial to the 24 men who lost their lives during the tunnel's construction. There is no Bramhope railway station.  Schools  A village school was built in Eastgate where the war memorial garden is situated. A plaque states \\"On this site in 1790 a Day School was erected by the freeholders and copyholders of Bramhope Township. It was also used as a Sunday School and Public Meeting Place. Demolished 1961\\". The school became overcrowded whilst tunnelling work for the railway was going on in the late 1840s. It was replaced by a larger building in 1873 in Breary Lane, next to the shopping parade. The present school, situated on Tredgold Crescent, was opened in 1961.  Community  Robert Craven Memorial Hall Bramhope has a Round Table, which organises activities to raise money for charity. Bramhope has a cricket club which plays at the Recreation Ground on Old Lane. The club plays in the Leeds and Wetherby Cricket League and has two senior teams. = Memorial Hall = Robert Craven Memorial Hall (originally the Craven Institute, 1896) was part of the bequest of Robert Craven, a local farmer. It is now the village hall and administered as a registered charity. It has a crown bowling green, car park and tennis courts. Inside there are various rooms plus a large hall with stage, which doubles as a badminton court. On the second Saturday of every month a farmer's market is hosted at this hall. The memorial hall also hosts a yearly flower show in the autumn, and a bridge club. =Bramhope Scout Campsite= The 13-acre Bramhope Scout Campsite, to the west of the village, is owned by Central Yorkshire Scouts.

It was discovered by the Italian court astronomer Giovanni Batista Hodierna, who published his finding in 1654. William Herschel called it a \\"beautiful cluster\\", while William Henry Smyth said it \\"has a beautiful appearance, the bright white star being surrounded by a rich gathering of minute companions, in a slightly elongated form, and nearly vertical position\\". In the past it has also been listed as a nebula, but in 1930 Robert J. Trumpler found no evidence of nebulosity. The brightest member star system is Tau Canis Majoris, and therefore it is sometimes called the Tau Canis Majoris Cluster. The cluster is located at a distance of approximately 1.48 kpc from the Sun, and appears associated with the giant nebula Sh2-310 that lies at the same distance, about one degree to the east. This giant H II region is being ionized by the brighter members of the NGC 2362 cluster. NGC 2362 is a relatively young 4‚Äì5 million years in age but is devoid of star-forming gas and dust, indicating that the star formation process has come to a halt.

Local officers of Spain and the United States agreed to leave the Neutral Ground temporarily outside the jurisdiction of either country. The area, now in western Louisiana, had neutral status from 1806 to 1821.  Background  Spain had been concerned for many years with what it viewed as the encroachment of the French from Louisiana into Texas. About 1734, the French moved their post at Natchitoches from the east to the west side of the Red River. The Spanish governor of Texas, Manuel de Sandoval, was reprimanded for not protesting this violation of what Spain believed was its sovereign territory. In 1740, Governor Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra was ordered to investigate French intrusion in the Natchitoches area. Other investigations were ordered in 1744 and 1751.\\"The Neutral Ground\\" chronology , at Louisiana Places In 1753, Texas Governor Jacinto de Barrios y J√°uregui determined that the French had encroached on Texas by occupying territory to the west of Arroyo Hondo, a small creek in western Natchitoches Parish that had previously been used by the French as their western boundary with Texas. In 1764, the boundary dispute became temporarily moot when France ceded its Louisiana colony to Spain. This colony was the large area west of the Mississippi River but drained by the same, plus New Orleans and its immediate vicinity.See Louisiana (New Spain) The transfer was made without resolving the earlier border dispute, which did not seem significant under the circumstances. Spain administered the area from Havana, contracting out governing to people from many nationalities as long as they swore allegiance to Spain and promised to publicly worship in Catholic churches. Many Americans took advantage of these grants that would eventually become known as Rio Hondo claims.Claims to Land Between the Rio Hondo and Sabine Rivers in Louisiana. Communicated to the Senate January 31, 1825 By the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso of October 1, 1800, Louisiana was formally transferred back to France, although the Spanish continued to administer it. The terms of the treaty did not specify the boundaries of the territory being returned. Rumors of the treaty reached U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, who sought to purchase land at the mouth of the Mississippi to ensure American access to the Gulf of Mexico. Jefferson discovered that Napoleon was willing to sell the entire territory to help fund his wars in Europe. France took formal control of Louisiana from Spain on November 30, 1803, and turned over New Orleans to the United States on December 20, 1803. The U.S. took over the rest of the territory on March 10, 1804. The Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the United States and opened U.S. expansion west to the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf Coast.  The boundary dispute between Spain and the United States  The precise boundaries of the area had still not been determined. The United States, having purchased the territory from France, claimed the same boundaries France had claimed before the transfer to Spain. In fact, the U.S. asserted a claim to the Rio Grande as the western border, based on the temporary settlement by Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in Texas in 1684. The more serious U.S. claim, however, was to the Sabine River, today's boundary between the U.S. states of Louisiana and Texas. Spanish claims were the same as before ‚Äî to the Arroyo Hondo in Natchitoches Parish and, south of the Kisatchie Hills, to the Calcasieu River. Negotiations to resolve the dispute broke down in 1805 when Spain severed diplomatic relations with the United States. From October 1805 until October 1806, there was continual skirmishing, both verbal and military, around the Sabine River. There were rumors that both sides were amassing troops near the disputed area.\\"The Cabildo\\", at the Louisiana State Museum web site = Establishment of the Neutral Ground = Neither side, however, wanted to go to war over the dispute. In order to avert further armed clashes, U.S. General James Wilkinson and Spanish Lt. Col. Sim√≥n de Herrera, the two military commanders in the region, signed an agreement declaring the disputed territory Neutral Ground (November 5, 1806),Neutral Ground agreement -retrieved 2010-12-24 until the boundary could be formally established by their respective governments. The agreement was not a treaty and was not ratified by either government, although it was largely respected. Even with this agreement, the boundaries of the Neutral Ground were not entirely specified. The Arroyo Hondo and (unconnected) Calcasieu River were the eastern boundary, with the Sabine River serving as the western boundary. The southern boundary was undoubtedly the Gulf of Mexico, and it can be assumed that the northern boundary was the thirty-second parallel, approximately.John V. Haggard, \\"Neutral Ground\\", Handbook of Texas Online It included portions of the present-day Louisiana parishes of De Soto, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon, Rapides, Beauregard, Allen, Calcasieu, Jefferson Davis, and Cameron.\\"Louisiana Documents: The Territorial Legislature Defines Counties in 1805\\" , at Louisiana Places The area covered by the agreement was declared off-limits to soldiers of both countries. The agreement also stipulated that no settlers would be permitted in the Neutral Ground. Nevertheless, settlers from New Spain and the United States territory began to move in. After the area was recognized as a part of the United States, these settlers were granted third class homestead claims. (Those with Spanish land grants predating the sale of the Louisiana Purchase to the United States were granted first class claims.) Some of the settlers from the United States would form the nucleus of the Louisiana Redbone community. This lawless area also attracted exiles, deserters, political refugees, fortune hunters, and a variety of criminals. Eventually, the highwaymen organized to the degree that they manned outposts and organized spies in order to better fleece travelers and avoid the American and Spanish military.\\"Texas 1806\\" , Texas Archeological Society In 1810 and again in 1812 the two governments sent joint military expeditions into the area to expel outlaws.  Resolution and afterward  The Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty,Adams-Onis Treaty -Retrieved 2010-12-24 signed in 1819 and ratified in 1821, recognized the U.S. claim, setting the border at the Sabine River. Spain surrendered any claim to the area. (Two years after the treaty was negotiated, New Spain won its independence as the Mexican Empire.) After the treaty, however, the Neutral Ground and the adjacent part of East Texas remained in the hands of the Spanish. The Regulator‚ÄìModerator War in East Texas in 1839‚Äì44 had its roots in the earlier anarchy of the Neutral Ground.\\"The Worst Feud\\" by Bob Bowman, at TexasEscapes.com  See also  *Fort Jessup *Los Adaes *History of Lake Charles, Louisiana *Redbone (ethnicity) *Spain ‚Äì United States relations  References   Bibliography  *J.

Boston: Heinle. as the sixth child and second son of Prudencio Quiroga and Pastora Forteza, a middle-class family. At the time of his birth, his father had been working for 18 years as head of the Argentine Vice-Consulate. Before Quiroga was two and a half months old, on March 14, 1879, his father accidentally fired a gun he was carrying in his hands and died as a result. Quiroga was baptized three months later in the parish church of his native town. = Training and travels = Quiroga in 1897. Quiroga finished school in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. He studied at the National College and also attended the Polytechnic Institute of Montevideo for technical training. From a very young age, he showed great interest in a variety of subjects and activities including literature, chemistry, photography, mechanics, cycling and country life. Around this time he founded the Salto Cycling Club and achieved the remarkable feat of cycling from his home town to Paysand√∫, a distance of 120 kilometres (74¬Ω miles).=) It was also around this time that he worked in a machinery repair shop; under the influence of the owner's son he became interested in philosophy, describing himself as a \\"forthright and passionate foot soldier of materialism.\\" At the age of 22, Quiroga became interested in poetry, discovering the work of Leopoldo Lugones, with whom he would later become great friends, and of Edgar Allan Poe. This led him to dabble in various forms and styles of poetic expression himself: post- romanticism, symbolism and modernism. He soon began to publish his poems in his home town. While studying and working, he collaborated with publications such as La Revista and La Reforma, improving his style and making a name for himself. During the Carnival of 1898, the young poet met his first love, a girl named Mary Esther Jurkovski, who would inspire two of his most important works: Las sacrificadas (1920; The Slaughtered) and Una estaci√≥n de amor (1912; A Season of Love). However, the young girl's Jewish parents disapproved of the relationship on the grounds that Quiroga was a Gentile, and the couple were forced to separate. In his home town, he founded a magazine titled Revista de Salto (1899). In the same year, his stepfather committed suicide by shooting himself; Quiroga witnessed the death. With the money he received as inheritance he embarked on a four-month trip to Paris, which turned out to be a failure: he returned to Uruguay hungry and disheartened. =Consistory of the Gay Science and early works= On his return Quiroga gathered together his friends Federico Ferrando, Alberto Brignole, Julio Jaureche, Fern√°ndez Salda√±a, Jos√© Hasda and Asdr√∫bal Delgado, and with them founded the Consistorio del Gay Saber (The Consistory of The Gay Science), a literary laboratory for their experimental writing, in which they found new ways to express themselves and their modernist goals. In 1901 Quiroga published his first book, Los Arrecifes de Coral (Coral Reefs), but the achievement was overshadowed by the deaths of two of his siblings, Prudencio and Pastora, who were victims of typhoid fever in Chaco. That fateful year held yet another shocking event in store for Quiroga. His friend Federico Ferrando had received bad reviews from Germ√°n Papini, a Montevideo journalist, and challenged him to a duel. Quiroga, anxious about his friend's safety, offered to check and clean the gun that was to be used. While inspecting the weapon, he accidentally fired off a shot that hit Ferrando in the mouth, killing him instantly. When the police arrived, Quiroga was arrested, interrogated and transferred to a correctional prison. The police investigated the circumstances of the homicide and deemed Ferrando's death an accident; Quiroga was released after four days' detention. He was eventually exonerated of blame. Racked with grief and guilt over the death of his beloved friend, Quiroga dissolved The Consistory and moved from Uruguay to Argentina. He crossed the R√≠o de la Plata in 1902 and went to live with Mar√≠a, one of his sisters. In Buenos Aires Quiroga the artist reached professional maturity, which would come to full fruition during his stays in the jungle. His sister's husband also introduced him to pedagogy and found him work as a teacher under contract to the board of examination for the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. He was appointed professor of Castilian at the British School of Buenos Aires in March 1903. = To Chaco and back to Buenos Aires = In June of that year Quiroga, already an experienced photographer, accompanied Leopoldo Lugones on an expedition, funded by the Argentine Ministry of Education, in which the famous Argentine poet planned to investigate some ruins of Jesuit missions in the province of Misiones. The jungle of Misiones left a profound impression on Quiroga that marked his life forever: he spent six months and the last of his inheritance (seven thousand pesos) on some land for cotton in Chaco province, located seven kilometers from Resistencia, next to the Saladito River. The project failed, due to problems with his aboriginal workers, but Quiroga's life was enriched by experiencing life as a countryman for the first time. His narrative benefited from his new knowledge of country people and rural culture; this permanently changed his style. Upon returning to Buenos Aires after his failed experience in the Chaco, Quiroga embraced the short story with passion and energy. In 1904 he published a book of stories called The Crime of Another, which was heavily influenced by the style of Edgar Allan Poe. Quiroga did not mind these early comparisons with Poe, and until the end of his life, he would often say that Poe was his first and principal teacher. Quiroga worked for the next two years on a multitude of stories, many were about rural terror, but others were delightful stories for children. During this time he wrote the magnificent horror story, \\"The Feather Pillow\\". It was published in 1907 by a famous magazine in Argentina, Caras y Caretas (\\"Faces and Masks\\"), which went on to publish eight of his other stories that year. Shortly after it was published, Quiroga became famous and his writings were eagerly sought by thousands of readers. = Love and the jungle = In 1906 Quiroga decided to return to his beloved jungle. Taking advantage of the fact that the government wanted the land to be used, Quiroga bought a farm (with Vincent Gozalbo) of in the province of Misiones, on the banks of the Upper Parana, and began making preparations, while teaching Castilian and Literature nearby. He moved in during the winter of 1908. Quiroga fell in love with one of his teenage students, Ana Mar√≠a Cires, to whom he would dedicate his first novel, entitled History of a Troubled Love. Quiroga insisted on the relationship despite the opposition of her parents, eventually garnering their permission to marry her and take her to live in the jungle with him. Quiroga's parents-in-law were concerned about the risks of living in Misiones, a wild region, and that is why they decided to join their daughter and son-in-law, and live close by in order to help them. So, Ana Mar√≠a's parents and a friend of her mother moved into a house near Quiroga. In 1911, Ana Mar√≠a gave birth to the couple's first child, at their home in the jungle; they named her Egl√© Quiroga. During the same year, the writer began farming in partnership with his friend, fellow Uruguayan Vicente Gozalbo, and he was also appointed Justice of the Peace in the Civil Registry of San Ignacio. This job was not the best fit for Quiroga who, forgetful, disorganized and careless, took to the habit of jotting down deaths, marriages and births on small pieces of paper and \\"archiving\\" them in a cookie tin. Later, a character in one of his stories was given a similar trait. The following year Ana Mar√≠a gave birth to a son, named Dar√≠o. Quiroga decided, just as the children were learning to walk, that he would personally take care of their education. Stern and dictatorial, Quiroga demanded that every little detail be done according to his requirements. From a young age, his children got used to the mountains and jungle. Quiroga exposed them to danger so that they would be able to cope alone and overcome any situation. He even went as far as to leave them alone one night in the jungle; another time he made them sit on the edge of a cliff with their legs dangling into the void. His daughter learned to breed wild animals and the son to use a shotgun, ride a bike and travel alone in a canoe. Quiroga's children never objected to these experiences and actually enjoyed them. Their mother, however, was terrified and exasperated by her husband's eccentric ways. Elements of this upbringing appear in his short story, \\"Hijo,\\" (\\"Son\\") written in 1935 and included in his collection M√°s all√°. Between 1912 and 1915 the writer, who already had experience as a cotton farmer and herbalist, undertook a bold pursuit to increase the farming and maximize the natural resources of their lands. He began to distill oranges and produce coal and resins, as well as many other similar activities. Meanwhile, he raised livestock, domesticated wild animals, hunted, and fished. Literature continued to be the peak of his life: in the journal Fray Mocho de Buenos Aires Quiroga published numerous stories, many set in the jungle and populated by characters so naturalistic that they seemed real. But Quiroga's wife was not happy: although she had become well-adapted to life in the jungle, the relationship between her and her husband was fraught with discord. Clashes between the couple occurred frequently, and although the cause was usually trivial, their excessive arguments became daily setbacks. These incidences, accentuated by Quiroga's volatile nature, disturbed his wife so greatly that she became severely depressed. Ana Mar√≠a became a new tragedy in Quiroga's life when, after a violent fight with the writer, she ingested a fatal dose of \\"sublimado,\\" or Mercury(II) chloride. Unfortunately, the poison did not kill her instantly; instead, she was forced to endure terrible agony for eight days before finally dying in her husband's arms on December 14, 1915. The tragedy of Ana Mar√≠a's painful death plunged Quiroga and his two children, five-year-old Egl√© and four-year-old Dar√≠o, into dark despair. = Buenos Aires = After this tragedy, Quiroga quickly left for Buenos Aires with his children where he became an Under-Secretary-General Accountant in the Uruguayan Consulate, thanks to the efforts of some of his friends who wanted to help. Throughout the year 1917 Quiroga lived in a basement with his children on Avenue Canning, alternating his diplomatic work with setting up a home office and working on many stories, which were being published in prestigious magazines. Quiroga collected most of the stories in several books, the first was Tales of Love, Madness and Death (1917). Manuel Galvez, owner of a publishing firm, had suggested that he write it and the volume immediately became a huge success with audiences and critics, consolidating Quiroga as the true master of the Latin American short story. The following year he settled in a small apartment on Calle Ag√ºero, while he published Jungle Tales (1918, a collection of children's stories featuring animals and set in the Misiones rainforest). Quiroga dedicated this book to his children, who accompanied him during that rough period of poverty in the damp basement. 1919 was a good year for Quiroga, with two major promotions in the consular ranks and the publication of his new book of stories, The Wild. The next year, following the idea of \\"The Consistory\\", Quiroga founded the Anaconda Association, a group of intellectuals involved in cultural activities in Argentina and Uruguay. His only play, The Slaughtered, was published in 1920 and was released in 1921, when Anaconda was released (another book of short stories). An important Argentine newspaper, La Naci√≥n (The Nation), also began to publish his stories, which by now already enjoyed impressive popularity. Between 1922 and 1924, Quiroga served as secretary of a cultural embassy to Brazil and he published his new book: The Desert (stories). For a while the writer was devoted to film criticism, taking charge of the magazine section of \\"Atlantis, The Home and The Nation\\". He also wrote the screenplay for a feature film (The Florida Raft) that was never filmed. Shortly thereafter, he was invited to form a School of Cinematography by Russian investors, but it was unsuccessful. = New love and some hobbies = Quiroga repairing a canoe in San Ignacio, Misiones Province, 1926. Quiroga then returned to Misiones. He was in love again, this time with a 22-year-old Ana Mar√≠a Palacio. He tried to persuade her parents to let her go to live in the jungle with him. Palacio's parents' unrelenting rejection of this idea and the consequent failure of the relationship inspired the theme of his second novel, Past love (published later, in 1929). The novel contains autobiographical elements of the strategies he used himself to get the girl, such as leaving messages in a hollowed branch, sending letters written in code and trying to dig a long tunnel to her room with thoughts of kidnapping her. Finally, the parents grew tired of Quiroga's attempts and took her away so he was forced to renounce his love. In the workshop in his house, he built a boat he christened Gaviota. His home was on the water and he used the boat to go from San Ignacio downriver to Buenos Aires and on numerous river expeditions. In early 1926, Quiroga returned to Buenos Aires and rented a villa in a suburban area. At the height of his popularity, a major publisher honored him, along with other literary figures of the time such as Arturo Capdevila, Baldomero Fernandez Moreno, Benito Lynch, Juana de Ibarbourou, Armando Donoso and Luis Franco. A lover of classical music, Quiroga often attended the concerts of the Wagner Association. He also tirelessly read technical texts, manuals on mechanics, and books on arts and physics. In 1927, Quiroga decided to raise and domesticate wild animals, while publishing his new book of short stories, Exiles. But the amorous artist had already set his eyes on what would be his last love: Mar√≠a Elena Bravo, a classmate of his daughter Egl√©, who married him that year, not even 20 years old (He was 49). = Back to the jungle = In 1932 Quiroga again settled in Misiones, where he would retire, with his wife and third daughter (Mar√≠a Elena, called Pitoca, who was born in 1928). To do this, he got a decree transferring his consular office to a nearby city. He was devoted to living quietly in the jungle with his wife and daughter. Due to a change of government, his services were declined and he was expelled from the consulate. To exacerbate Quiroga's problems, his wife did not like living in the jungle, so fighting and violent discussions became a daily occurrence. In this time of frustration and pain he published a collection of short stories titled Beyond (1935). From his interest in the work of Munthe and Ibsen, Quiroga began reading new authors and styles and began planning his autobiography. =Disease and death= In 1935 Quiroga began to experience uncomfortable symptoms, apparently related to prostatitis or another prostate disease. With the pain intensifying and difficulty urinating, his wife managed to convince him to go to Posadas, where he was diagnosed with prostate hypertrophy. But the problems continued for the Quiroga family: his wife and daughter left him permanently, leaving him alone and sick in the jungle. They went back to Buenos Aires, and the writer's spirits fell completely in the face of this serious loss. When he could not stand the disease anymore, Quiroga traveled to Buenos Aires for treatment. In 1937, an exploratory surgery revealed that he suffered from an advanced case of prostate cancer, untreatable and inoperable. Mar√≠a Elena and his large group of friends came to comfort him. When Quiroga was in the emergency ward, he had learned that a patient was shut up in the basement with hideous deformities similar to those of the infamous English Joseph Merrick (the \\"Elephant Man\\"). Taking pity, Quiroga demanded that the patient, named Vicent Batistessa, be released from confinement and moved into his room. As expected, Batistessa befriended and paid eternal gratitude to the great storyteller. Feeling desperate about his present suffering and realizing that his life was over, he told Batistessa his plan to shorten his suffering and Batistessa promised to help. That morning (February 19, 1937) in the presence of his friend, Horacio Quiroga drank a glass of cyanide that killed him within minutes of unbearable pain. His body was buried in the grounds of the Casa del Teatro de la Sociedad Argentina de Escritores (SADE), of which he was the founder and vice-president, although his remains were later repatriated to his homeland.  Work  The house in San Ignacio where Quiroga lived, now a museum. Being a follower of the modernist school founded by Rub√©n Dar√≠o and an obsessive reader of Edgar Allan Poe and Guy de Maupassant, Quiroga was attracted to topics covering the most intriguing aspects of nature, often tinged with horror, disease, insanity and human suffering. Many of his stories belong to this movement, embodied in his work Tales of Love, Madness and Death. Quiroga was also inspired by British writer Rudyard Kipling (The Jungle Book), which is shown in his own Jungle Tales, a delightful exercise in fantasy divided into several stories featuring animals.Rodgers, Christy (2006). Quiroga, Kipling, and the Exotic Frontier: A Comparative Study. San Francisco State University. His Ten Rules for the Perfect Storyteller, dedicated to young writers, provides certain contradictions with his own work. While the Decalogue touts an economic and precise style, using few adjectives, natural and simple wording, and clarity of expression, in many of his own stories Quiroga did not follow his own principles, using ornate language, with plenty of adjectives and at times ostentatious vocabulary. As he further developed his particular style, Quiroga evolved into realistic portraits (often anguished and desperate) of the wild nature around him in Misiones: the jungle, the river, wildlife, climate, and terrain make up the scaffolding and scenery in which his characters move, suffer, and often die. Especially in his stories, Quiroga describes the tragedy that haunts the miserable rural workers in the region, the danger and suffering to which they are exposed, and how this existential pain is perpetuated to succeeding generations. He also experimented with many subjects considered taboo in the society of the early twentieth century. = Analysis of work = In his first book, Coral Reefs, consisting of 18 poems, 30 pages of poetic prose, and four stories, Quiroga shows his immaturity and adolescent confusion. On the other hand, he shows a glimpse of the modernist style and naturalistic elements that would come to characterize his later work. His two novels, History of a Troubled Love and Past Love, deal with the same theme that haunted the author in his personal life: love affairs between older men and teenage girls. In the first novel, Quiroga divided the action into three parts. In the first, a nine-year-old girl falls in love with an older man. In the second part, it is eight years later, and the man, who had noticed her affection, begins to woo her. The third part is the present tense of the novel, in which it has been ten years since the young girl left the man. In Past Love history repeats itself: a grown man returns to a place after years of absence and falls for a young woman he had loved as a child. Knowing the personal history of Quiroga, the two novels feature some autobiographical components. For example, the protagonist in History of a Trouble Love is named Egl√© (the name of Quiroga's daughter, whose classmate he later married). Also, in these novels, there is a great deal of emphasis on the opposition of the girls' parents, rejection that Quiroga had accepted as part of his life and that he always had to deal with. The critics never liked his novels and called his only play, The Slaughtered, \\"a mistake.\\" They considered his short stories to be his most transcendent works, and some have credited them with stimulating all Latin American short stories after him. This makes sense since Quiroga was the first person to be concerned about the technical aspects of the short story, tirelessly honing his style (for which he always returns to the same subjects) to reach near-perfection in his last works. Though clearly influenced by modernism, he gradually begins to turn the decadent Uruguayan language to describing the natural surroundings with meticulous precision. But he makes it clear that Nature's relationship with man is always one of conflict. Loss, injury, misery, failures, starvation, death, and animal attacks plague Quiroga's human characters. Nature is hostile, and it almost always wins. Quiroga's morbid obsession with torment and death is much more easily accepted by the characters than by the reader: in the narrative technique the author uses, he presents players accustomed to risk and danger, playing by clear and specific rules. They know not to make mistakes because the forest is unforgiving, and failure often means death. Nature is blind but fair, and the attacks on the farmer or fisherman (a swarm of angry bees, an alligator, a bloodsucking parasite, etc.) are simply obstacles in a horrible game in which Man tries to snatch property or natural resources (reflecting Quiroga's efforts to do so in life), and Nature absolutely refuses to let go, an unequal struggle that usually ends with the human loss, dementia, death, or simply disappointment. Sensitive, excitable, given to impossible love, thwarted in his commercial enterprises but still highly creative, Quiroga waded through his tragic life and suffered through nature to construct, with the eyes of a careful observer, narrative work that critics considered \\"autobiographical poetry\\". Perhaps it is this \\"internal realism\\" or the \\"organic\\" nature of his writing that created the irresistible draw that Quiroga continues to have on readers.

German trenches are at the right and bottom, and British trenches are at the top left. The vertical line to the left of centre indicates the course of a pre-war road or track. No man's land is land that is unoccupied or is under dispute between parties who leave it unoccupied out of fear or uncertainty. The term was originally used to define a contested territory or a dumping ground for refuse between fiefdoms. In modern times it is commonly associated with World War I to describe the area of land between two enemy trench systems, which neither side wished to cross or seize for fear of being attacked by the enemy in the process.Coleman p. 268 The term is also used to refer to ambiguity, an anomalous, or indefinite area, in regards to an application, situation, or jurisdiction.  Origin  According to Alasdair Pinkerton, an expert in human geography at the Royal Holloway University of London, the term is first mentioned in Domesday Book in the 11th century, to describe parcels of land that were just beyond the London city walls. The Oxford English Dictionary contains a reference to the term dating back to 1320, spelled nonesmanneslond, to describe a territory that was disputed or involved in a legal disagreement.Persico p. 68Levenback p. 95 The same term was later used as the name for the piece of land outside the north wall of London that was assigned as the place of execution. The term was also applied to a little-used area on ships called the forecastle, where various ropes, tackle, block, and other supplies were stored.Hendrickson, Robert Facts on File Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins (2008) In the United Kingdom, several places called No Man's Land denoted \\"extra-parochial spaces that were beyond the rule of the church, beyond the rule of different fiefdoms that were handed out by the king ‚Ä¶ ribbons of land between these different regimes of power\\". Examples = World War I = A stretch of no man's land at Flanders Fields, Belgium, 1919 The British Army did not widely employ the term when the Regular Army arrived in France in August 1914, soon after the outbreak of World War I. The terms used most frequently at the start of the war to describe the area between the trench lines included 'between the trenches' or 'between the lines'. The term 'no man's land' was first used in a military context by soldier and historian Ernest Swinton in his short story \\"The Point of View\\". Swinton used the term in war correspondence on the Western Front, with specific mention of the terms with respect to the Race to the Sea in late 1914. The Anglo-German Christmas truce of 1914 brought the term into common use, and thereafter it appeared frequently in official communiqu√©s, newspaper reports, and personnel correspondences of the members of the British Expeditionary Force. In World War I, no man's land often ranged from several hundred yards to in some cases less than 10 yards. Heavily defended by machine guns, mortars, artillery, and riflemen on both sides, it was often extensively cratered, and was riddled with barbed wire, rudimentary improvised land mines, as well as corpses and wounded soldiers who were unable to make it through the hail of bullets, explosions, and flames. The area was sometimes contaminated by chemical weapons. It was open to fire from the opposing trenches and hard going generally slowed any attempted advance. Not only were soldiers forced to cross no man's land when advancing, and as the case might be when retreating, but after an attack the stretcher bearers had to enter it to bring in the wounded. No man's land remained a regular feature of the battlefield until near the end of World War I, when mechanised weapons (i.e., tanks) made entrenched lines less of an obstacle. Effects from World War I no man's lands persist today, for example at Verdun in France, where the Zone Rouge (Red Zone) contains unexploded ordnance, and is poisoned beyond habitation by arsenic, chlorine, and phosgene. The zone is sealed off completely and still deemed too dangerous for civilians to return: \\"The area is still considered to be very poisoned, so the French government planted an enormous forest of black pines, like a living sarcophagus\\", comments Alasdair Pinkerton, a researcher at Royal Holloway University of London, who compared the zone to the nuclear disaster site at Chernobyl, similarly encased in a \\"concrete sarcophagus\\". = Cold War = During the Cold War, one example of \\"no man's land\\" was the territory close to the Iron Curtain. Officially the territory belonged to the Eastern Bloc countries, but over the entire Iron Curtain there were several wide tracts of uninhabited land, several hundred meters in width, containing watch towers, minefields, unexploded bombs, and other such debris. Would-be escapees from Eastern Bloc countries who successfully scaled the border fortifications could still be apprehended or shot by border guards in the zone. The U.S. Naval Base at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba is separated from Cuba proper by an area called the Cactus Curtain. In late 1961, the Cuban Army had its troops plant an barrier of Opuntia cactus along the northeastern section of the fence surrounding the base to prevent economic migrants fleeing from Cuba from resettling in the United States. This was dubbed the \\"Cactus Curtain\\", an allusion to Europe's Iron Curtain and the Bamboo Curtain in East Asia. U.S. and Cuban troops placed some 55,000 land mines across the no man's land, creating the second-largest minefield in the world, and the largest in the Americas. On 16 May 1996, President Bill Clinton ordered the U.S. land mines to be removed and replaced with motion and sound sensors to detect intruders. The Cuban government has not removed the corresponding minefield on its side of the border. = Israel‚ÄìJordan = No man's land in alt=Largely empty land near the Old City wall, Dormition Abbey (on the far right), and Tower of David (centre-left). The 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Transjordan were signed in Rhodes with the help of UN mediation on 3 April 1949. Armistice lines were determined in November 1948. Between the lines territory was left that was defined as no man's land. Such areas existed in Jerusalem in the area between the western and southern parts of the Walls of Jerusalem and Musrara.

(Subsequent parenthetical page references throughout are to this ed.) Characters *Hirst, a man in his sixties *Spooner, a man in his sixties *Foster, a man in his thirties *Briggs, a man in his forties Hirst is an alcoholic upper-class litterateur who lives in a grand house presumed to be in Hampstead, with Foster and Briggs, respectively his purported amanuensis and man servant (or apparent bodyguard), who may be lovers. Spooner, a \\"failed, down-at-heel poet\\" whom Hirst has \\"picked up in a Hampstead pub\\" and invited home for a drink, becomes Hirst's house guest for the night; claiming to be a fellow poet, through a contest of at least-partly fantastic reminiscences, he appears to have known Hirst at university and to have shared male and female acquaintances and relationships. The four characters are named after cricket players.(Billington, Harold Pinter 245‚Äì46) It has been suggested that Spooner was originally inspired by the poet Eddie Linden, whom Pinter knew. Plot synopsis =Act 1= A man in his sixties named Hirst begins a night of heavy drinking (mainly vodka) in his drawing room with an anonymous peer whom he only just met at a pub. Hirst's overly talkative guest, calling himself a poet, long-windedly explains how he is penetratingly perceptive, until he finally introduces himself as \\"Spooner\\". As the men are becoming more intoxicated, Hirst suddenly rises and throws his glass, while Spooner abruptly taunts Hirst about his masculinity and wife. Hirst merely comments \\"No man's land...does not move...or change...or grow old...remains...forever...icy...silent\\", before collapsing twice and finally crawling out of the room. A young man enters and suspiciously questions Spooner, who now becomes relatively silent, about his identity. The younger man introduces himself as John \\"Jack\\" Foster before the entrance of a fourth man, Briggs, who is in his forties and who also unsuccessfully questions Spooner and then bickers with Foster. At last, Hirst reenters, having slept, and struggles to remember a recent dream. Foster and Briggs have also started drinking, and they refill the older men's glasses. Hirst mentions an album of photographs he keeps, commenting on the appearances of the people in the album. He does not appear to fully remember Spooner's identity, insisting that his true friends are kept safely in the album. He begins drinking straight from the bottle, mutters incoherent statements, and continues to ponder his dream‚Äîinvolving someone drowning‚Äîwhen Spooner abruptly says that he was the one drowning in Hirst's dream. Hirst drunkenly collapses and Spooner now rushes in to Hirst's aid, brushing away the two younger men and claiming to be Hirst's true friend. The younger pair becomes defensive and accusatory, asserting their obligation to protect Hirst against \\"men of evil\\". Foster openly criticises his own past, as well as Hirst's impulsiveness and alcoholism. It gradually becomes apparent that Foster is Hirst's apprentice and housekeeper, and Briggs is Hirst's personal servant. All exit except for Spooner and Foster, who says \\"Listen. You know what it's like when you're in a room with the light on and then suddenly the light goes out? I'll show you. It's like this\\". He flicks off the lights, causing a blackout. =Act 2= The next morning, Spooner, alone, stands from his chair and attempts to leave, but the door is locked. Briggs soon enters to deliver Spooner food and champagne, rambling on about how he met Foster and ignoring Spooner's desire to know why the door was locked. Spooner thinks of a quick excuse to leave; however, when Briggs mentions that both Foster and Hirst are poets, Spooner shows vague recognition of this fact. Hirst himself bursts in and is delighted to see Spooner, whom he oddly mistakes for (or pretends is) an old friend. He speaks as though the two were Oxbridge classmates in the 1930s, which Spooner finally plays along with. Hirst and Spooner then bizarrely discuss scandalous romantic encounters they both had with the same women, leading to a series of increasingly questionable reminiscences, until finally Hirst is accused of having had an affair with Spooner's own wife. All the while, Hirst refers to Briggs by a variety of inconsistent names and then launches into a rant about once-known faces in his photo album. Spooner says that Foster, who now reappears, should have pursued his dream of being a poet, instead of working for Hirst. Spooner shows great interest in seeing Hirst's photo album, but both Briggs and Foster discourage this. All four are now drinking champagne, and Foster, for his own pride and dignity's sake, abruptly asserts that he desired to work in this house of his own choice, where he feels privileged to serve as famous a writer as Hirst. Suddenly, Spooner asks desperately that Hirst consider hiring him as well, verbosely praising his own work ethic and other virtues. After all this, Hirst merely replies \\"Let's change the subject for the last time\\", and after a pause worriedly asks \\"What have I said?\\" Foster explains definitively that Hirst's statement means that he (Hirst) will never be able to change the subject ever again. Hirst thinks back to his youth, when he mistakenly thought he saw a drowned body in a lake. Spooner now comments, \\"No. You are in no man's land. Which never moves, which never changes, which never grows older, but which remains forever, icy and silent.\\" Hirst responds \\"I'll drink to that!\\" and the lights fade slowly to black. Production history The London premi√®re of No Man's Land, directed by Peter Hall, opened at the Old Vic Theatre (then home to the National Theatre), on 24 April 1975, starring John Gielgud as Spooner and Ralph Richardson as Hirst and with Michael Kitchen as Foster and Terence Rigby as Briggs. It transferred to Wyndham's Theatre, in London's West End, on 15 July 1975 (Baker and Ross xxxiii). This production transferred to Broadway, in New York City, from October through December 1976, with Richardson nominated for the 1977 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for his performance as Hirst. Peter Hall's production returned to the National Theatre (NT), playing at the Lyttelton Theatre, from January through February 1977. The original production with Richardson and Gielgud was filmed for the National Theatre Archive and has been shown on British television as part of Pinter at the BBC on BBC Four. There is a related video clip of Pinter's official biographer Michael Billington discussing the play as part of the online features relating to Pinter at the BBC (2 mins., 17 secs.). A major revival at the Almeida Theatre, London, directed by David Leveaux, opened in February 1993, and starred Paul Eddington as Spooner and Pinter himself as Hirst; Douglas Hodge played Foster and Gawn Grainger played Briggs. In the Broadway revival by the Roundabout Theatre Company directed by David Jones, which opened on 27 February 1994 at the Criterion Centre Stage Right Theatre, in New York City, with Jason Robards as Hirst, Christopher Plummer (nominated for a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play) as Spooner, Tom Wood as Foster, and John Seitz as Briggs. Marquee for No Man's Land, Duke of York's Theatre, London, 30 December 2008 In 2001, another major revival at the NT was directed by Harold Pinter, with Corin Redgrave as Hirst, John Wood as Spooner, Danny Dyer as Foster, and Andy de la Tour as Briggs. In the summer of 2008, a production directed by Rupert Goold premi√®red at the Gate Theatre, in Dublin, with Michael Gambon (Hirst), David Bradley (Spooner), David Walliams (Foster), and Nick Dunning (Briggs). Goold's production transferred to the Duke of York's Theatre, in the West End, London, opening on 7 October 2008 and closing on 3 January 2009, the week after Pinter's death on 24 December 2008. (Includes video clip.) A production directed by Sean Mathias opened at Berkeley Rep in August 2013, with Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Billy Crudup and Shuler Hensley. It opened on Broadway at the Cort Theatre, in repertory with Waiting for Godot, on 24 November 2013 (previews began on 31 October 2013). It closed on 30 March 2014, but was restaged in the UK in 2016, with Owen Teale and Damien Molony replacing Hensley and Crudup. It played at the Sheffield Lyceum, Newcastle Theatre Royal, Brighton Theatre Royal and Cardiff New Theatre before transferring to Wyndham's Theatre in London's West End. Critical reception and interpretation In reviewing the London premi√®re, on 24 April 1975, Michael Billington, of The Guardian, observes that the play is \\"about precisely what its title suggests\\": > the sense of being caught in some mysterious limbo between life and death, > between a world of brute reality and one of fluid uncertainty. ... the play > is a masterly summation of all the themes that have long obsessed Pinter: > the fallibility of memory, the co-existence in one man of brute strength and > sensitivity, the ultimate unknowability of women, the notion that all human > contact is a battle between who and whom. ... It is in no sense a dry, > mannerist work but a living, theatrical experience full of rich comedy in > which one speech constantly undercuts another. Over a decade after having written The Life and Work of Harold Pinter (London: Faber, 1996), the first edition of his authorised biography of Pinter, Billington discusses his critical perspective on the play in his videotaped discussion for Pinter at the BBC, broadcast on BBC Four television from 26 October through 9 November 2002. After admitting that No Man's Land is a \\"haunting weird play\\" that he himself \\"can never fully understand ‚Äì Who can? ‚Äì but it works on you\\", he reviews the genesis of the play's first line (\\"As it is?\\"), which came to Pinter in a taxicab while riding home from dinner out alone, and the thematic significance of the titular metaphorical phrase no man's land, and finds \\"something of Pinter\\" in both of the main characters, each one a writer whom Pinter may have to some degree feared becoming: one \\"with all the trappings of success but [who] is inured by fame, wealth, comfort\\" (Hirst); the other, \\"the struggling, marginal, the pin-striped writer\\" who \\"does not make it\\" (Spooner); though when Billington put his theory to Pinter, Pinter said (jokingly), \\"Well, yes, maybe; but I've never had two man-servants named Foster and Briggs.\\" In reviewing Goold's revival of the play at the Duke of York's Theatre in 2008, Billington points out that \\"Hirst, a litterateur haunted by dreams and memories, is, as he tells Spooner, 'in the last lap of a race I had long forgotten to run'. But, while his servants conspire to lead Hirst to oblivion, Spooner attempts a chivalric rescue-act, dragging him towards the light of the living. The assumption is that his bid fails, as all four characters are finally marooned in a no-man's land 'which remains forever, icy and silent'.\\" In this play replete with echoes of T. S. Eliot, Spooner may appear to have failed in his apparent efforts to ingratiate himself with and perhaps even to \\"rescue\\" Hirst from \\"drowning\\" himself in drink. (Considers the significance of the allusions to works by T. S. Eliot, such as the Four Quartets, \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\", and The Waste Land, \\"in the verbal imagery of the two dueling former and/or would-be poets in No Man's Land.\\") But Spooner still remains in the house at the end of the play, \\"in no man's land,\\" along with Hirst (and Foster and Briggs), and the play ends in an impasse much like that of Pinter's 1960 play The Caretaker, to which critics compare No Man's Land. As various other critics do, Michael Coveney is still asking: \\"Yes, but what does it all mean? Kenneth Tynan railed against the 'gratuitous obscurity' of Harold Pinter's poetic 1975 play when it was first produced by Peter Hall at the National starring John Gielgud as the supplicant versifier Spooner and Ralph Richardson as his host Hirst, patron and supporter of the arts. But the play is always gloriously enjoyable as an off-kilter vaudeville of friendship and dependency.\\" In The Guardian, Billington concludes that \\"This is a compelling revival much aided by Neil Austin's lighting and Adam Cork's subliminal sound,\\" observing: \\"when audience and cast finally joined in applauding Pinter, [who was] seated in a box, I felt it was in recognition of an eerily disturbing play that transports us into a world somewhere between reality and dream.\\" Both Billington and Paul Taylor (in The Independent) give the production 4 out of 5 stars, while Charles Spencer, reviewing the production in The Daily Telegraph, like other critics making inevitable comparisons with the original production, rates it as \\"equally fine, with Michael Gambon and David Bradley rising magnificently to the benchmark set by their illustrious predecessors,\\" but points out that he too does not feel that he fully understands it: \\"Even after three decades I cannot claim fully to understand this haunting drama that proves by turns funny, scary, and resonantly poetic, but I have no doubt that it is one of the handful of indisputable modern classics that Pinter has written, and a piece that will haunt and tantalise the memory of all who see it.\\" In another feature on Goold's 2008 revival, following the responses of \\"three Pinter virgins\\" who did not understand or enjoy it (\\"Matilda Egere-Cooper, urban music journalist: 'Obscure and exhausting' \\"; \\"David Knott, political lobbyist: 'Don't expect to feel uplifted...' \\"; and \\"Susie Rushton, editor and columnist: 'Where's the joke?' \\"), the Independents critic, Paul Taylor, reiterates his praise of No Man's Land, concluding: What is less clear is the purpose of the play's undercurrent of homosexuality. In the opening scene there are repeated references to scopophilia and Spooner asks Hirst if he often hangs \\"around Hampstead Heath\\" and the pub Jack Straw‚Äôs Castle, both notorious for homosexual activity in the 1960s and ‚Äò70s. Most analysts have tended to ignore this subtext but it is there. With this and lines with double meaning like \\"You had a cottage?\\" as well as oblique but explicit references to baleful mothers, \\"quaint little perversions\\", women \\"especially in Siam or Bali\\", \\"Lord Lancer\\", a man called Bunty and male virginity, it seems likely that Pinter is playing a joke of some kind on more naive critics and admirers.

It was discovered by William Herschel on December 31, 1788.http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n2419.html NGC 4189 at SEDS NGC 2419 is at a distance of about 300,000 light years from the solar system and at the same distance from the galactic center. NGC 2419 bears the nickname \\"the Intergalactic Wanderer,\\" which was bestowed when it was erroneously thought not to be in orbit around the Milky Way. Its orbit takes it further away from the galactic center than the Magellanic Clouds, but it can (with qualifications) be considered as part of the Milky Way. At this great distance it takes three billion years to make one trip around the galaxy.Ferris, Timothy. Seeing in the Dark. 2002. p. 244 The cluster is dim in comparison to more famous globular clusters such as M13. Nonetheless, NGC 2419 is a 9th magnitude object and is readily viewed, in good sky conditions, with good quality telescopes as small as 102mm (four inches) in aperture. Intrinsically it is one of the brightest and most massive globular clusters of our galaxy, having an absolute magnitude of -9.42 and being 900,000 times more massive than our Sun. It was proposed that NGC 2419 could be, as Omega Centauri, the remnant of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy disrupted and accreted by the Milky Way. However, later research seems to disprove that possibility. Astronomer Leos Ondra has noted that NGC 2419 would be the \\"best and brightest\\" for any observers in the Andromeda Galaxy, looking for globular clusters in our galaxy since it lies outside the obscuring density of the main disk. This is analogous to the way the cluster G1 can be seen orbiting outside of the Andromeda Galaxy from Earth.

Biography Rivers was born in Au Gres, Michigan and graduated from Au Gres- Sims High School, Arenac County, in 1975. She received a B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1987 and a J.D. from Wayne State University in 1992.

Rivers was elected as a Democrat from Michigan's 13th District to the United States House of Representatives for the 104th and to the three succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1995 to January 3, 2003. Rivers resorted to negative attack ads against her opponent David W. Geiss (the endorsed candidate of sitting Congressman William D. Ford) to win the Democratic primary in 1994. Her district was eliminated after Michigan lost a district in the United States 2000 Census, and most of her territory was merged with the 15th District of long-time incumbent John Dingell. Rivers challenged Dingell in the Democratic primary for the new 15th. However, running in a district that was over 65 percent new to her, she lost to Dingell. In 1994, Rivers spoke publicly about her 24-year struggle with bipolar disorder, making her the first member of the House to publicly discuss having emotional problems.

Tivat is the centre of Tivat Municipality, which is the smallest municipality by area in Montenegro. Name In Serbian and Montenegrin language the town is known as Tivat (–¢–∏–≤–∞—Ç); in Italian and Venetian as Teodo; the name of the city is derived either from the name of Illyrian Queen Teuta who ruled the region in 3rd Century BC, or from the Greek word \\"ŒòŒµŒØŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ\\" (Thiodhos meaning \\"way of God\\"). History According to legend, Tivat is derived from Illyrian queen Teuta. Teuta had a residence in Rhizon and a summer residence between the church of St. Rocco in Donja Lastva and Seljanovo. The name could also come from the names of old Christian saints: Saint Theodulus, Theodocius or Theodotus. Besides the popular name Theudo, a Latin expression Latus Tiuveti comes from the 16th century. Finally, the name could originate from Celtic word \\"touto\\", town. Archaeological sites attest that the area was inhabited in antiquity, with Greek and Roman settlements. Tombs and tombstones from the Roman period were discovered in Lastva and Opatovo. Tivat, the youngest town in the Boka area was established on the plateau at the bottom of Vrmac. According to the archives of Kotor (Cattaro), Teude, Theode, and Theudo was used for the settlement in the 14th century. During the Middle Ages the fertile lands of the area belonged mostly to the aristocrats of Cattaro, Prƒçanj and Dobrota. Estates, castles and chalets were there as well as the collective church of St Anton dating from 1373. Part of this inheritance, which was the property of the wealthy Buƒáa family, is a historic chalet which today houses Tivat's museums and galleries. The residence of the metropolitan of the bishopric of Zeta was built from the 13th to the 15th century on the Prevlaka Island. Tivat, known as Teodo in Venetian, was under the Republic of Venice as a part of Albania Veneta from 1420 to 1797. In those centuries Teodo enjoyed economic development that attracted many Serb refugees from Ottoman-held areas. Some Venetian-style buildings are still standing today. Rapid development of Tivat started in the second half of 19th century when the Austrian empire built a maritime arsenal for its fleet. Still the town shaped itself by developing small industry. In the beginning of 1918, in the Tivat Bay sailors revolted against the mighty Austrian empire. With great approval and support, people from this area followed their revolutionary actions. The period between two world wars was marked with syndicate activity in Raƒçica, Krtoli and Arsenal. Between 1941 and 1943 the town was part of the Italian Governatorate of Dalmatia. In 1889 the Naval arsenal was built by Austrians, and was later used as a naval military base of the Italian Navy, the Yugoslav People's Army and the Army of Montenegro. The JNA enjoyed an international reputation as a powerful, well- equipped, and well-trained force. The base was also used by Russia and Libya as the technical base for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of their ships and submarines. The former naval base is now \\"Porto Montenegro\\", a superyacht marina developed by Canadian billionaire Peter Munk, then sold in 2016 to the Investment Corporation of Dubai. Geography St. Marko and Our Lady of Grace Islands, near town of Tivat Tivat is located in the central part of the Bay of Kotor (Boka Kotorska, or simply \\"Boka\\"), south of mount Vrmac. The municipality lies mostly south of the town, and has an exit to open sea at the tourist location Pr≈æno inlet near Radoviƒái village to the south. Its central part, where Tivat Airport is located, lies in fertile Grbalj valley. The airport is located near the isthmus of Lu≈°tica peninsula, which belongs to the municipality of Herceg Novi for the most part. Its geographical position, climate and natural environment make it a tourist destination. Boka was described and celebrated in verse by many poets, writers and scientists: Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, Ljubomir Nenadoviƒá, Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, Simo Matavulj, Laza Kostiƒá, Aleksa ≈†antiƒá, Jovan Cvijiƒá and many others. Boka has captured many writers of travels from England, Germany and France, among them: Padget, Lamb, Fraser, Gilles Verne and Pierre Loti. American Boyd said: ‚ÄùGod made the world in six days, and on the seventh day he took his time and created this fjord under Lovcen.‚Äù Tivat has about 14,000 inhabitants. It is away from Herceg Novi, away from Kotor, away from Budva, from Dubrovnik and from Podgorica. Geomorphologically, Tivat is composed of three areas. The first is the hills and peaks of Vrmac, Velji Vrh () and Popova glava (). Water activity formed capes Seljanovo, Pakovo and Raƒçica. The second area is Tivat field, flattened by water activity. The third area is Krtoli with islands ‚Äì Island of Flowers, St. Marko, and Lady of Mercy which is bordered by Novski bay on the north-west and Grbalj area on the south-east. Population Tivat is the administrative centre of Tivat municipality, which has a population of 14,031 (2011). In 1981 the municipality had a population of 9,315: * 2,876 Croats * 2,831 Montenegrins * 2,384 Yugoslavs * 850 Serbs * 129 Albanians * 155 others In 1991 the municipality had a population of 11,404: * 3,809 Montenegrins (33.4%) * 2,663 Croats (23.35%) * 2,346 Yugoslavs (20.57%) * 1,724 Serbs (15.11%) * 219 Muslims (1.92%) * 485 others (4.27%) In 2011 the municipality had a population of 14,031:http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/popis2011/saopstenje/saopstenje(1).pdf *4,666 Montenegrins (33.25%) *4,435 Serbs (31.61%) *2,304 Croats (16.42%) *2,626 others/undeclared (18,71%) =Languages= * 5,493 Serbian (38.93%) * 4,319 Montenegrin (30.61%) * 1,167 Croatian (8.27%) * 3,132 rest and undeclared (22.19%) Tourism Porto Montenegro, luxury yacht marina Already a popular tourist resort, Tivat is set to become a nautical tourism centre for the southern Adriatic. The inlets near Prevlaka, as well as the localities of ≈Ωupa and Kalimanj, provide great conditions for the construction of marinas and yachting clubs. Canadian businessman Peter Munk bought a naval shipyard in Tivat, intending to transform it into a luxury vacation resort and a marina for luxury yachts called Porto Montenegro. In 1971 Tivat Airport acquired a modern runway and is now a significant airport for foreign air traffic. It served 1,367,282 passengers in 2019. Although it is the youngest town in the Boka region, Tivat has a number of tourist sites. Renaissance Summer House Buca in the centre of city, Ostrvo Cvijeƒáa (Flowers‚Äô Island) with sacred monuments, Gornja Lastva, the old nucleus at an altitude of , the magnificent sandy beach at Plavi Horizonti and the Sveti Marko Island with ex-Club Med cottages are the most visited. In the city itself there is the natural port Kalimanj. There is also a choice of cultural events, such as \\"Bocce Olympiad\\" and \\"Summer Fest\\". Tivat boasts a botanic garden planted with gifts from Bokan sailors who brought back a wide variety of exotic tree species and ornamental plants from their voyages. Transport Ferry at Lepetane. Tivat is connected with the rest of Montenegro by the Adriatic Highway, a two-laned road that runs down the length of Montenegrin coast. Travelling inland is possible by leaving the Adriatic Highway at Budva or Sutomore (through the Sozina tunnel). A ferry operates on the Kamenari - Lepetane line across the Verige strait, eliminating the need to go all the way around Boka Kotorska bay in order to reach the Herceg Novi riviera. It is speculated that a future Verige bridge will be constructed across the bay. Tivat Airport is away. This is the biggest airport in Montenegro, although Podgorica airport is more modern. There are regular flights to Belgrade throughout the year, and dozens of charter planes land daily at Tivat Airport during the summer season.

It is also known under the name for its publishing and corporate operations, as it is the company official name, while Type-Moon is a brand name as a homage to the original doujin group. After creating the popular visual novel Tsukihime as a doujin soft circle, Type-Moon has since incorporated and produced the also popular visual novel Fate/stay night. The latter has also been adapted into anime and manga series that have amassed a global fanbase. History Type-Moon was founded by artist Takashi Takeuchi and writer Kinoko Nasu, whose first project was the novel Kara no Kyoukai, which was originally released in October 1998 and reprinted in 2004. The company name Type-Moon actually comes from one of Nasu's older works, , written for the angel-themed doujin anthology Angel Voice in May 1999. In December 2000, Type-Moon released the adult Windows visual novel Tsukihime, which sold extremely well and amassed a large fanbase because of its comprehensive and expansive storyline and writer Kinoko Nasu's unique style of storytelling. The game led to the creation of numerous top selling merchandise, memorabilia, and a fanbase numbering millions around the world. Tsukihime was adapted soon after in 2003 into an anime series, Shingetsutan Tsukihime, which was produced by J.C.Staff and licensed by Geneon in North America, and a manga series based upon Shingetsutan Tsukihime that has been published since 2004. Soon after, in January 2001, Type-Moon released Plus-Disk, an addition to Tsukihime that featured three side-stories and assorted multimedia. In August 2001, Type-Moon released a sequel to Tsukihime, Kagetsu Tohya, and soon, in April 2003 released Tsuki-Bako, a specially packaged three-disk set that included Tsukihime, Plus-Disk, and Kagetsu Tohya, as well as a remixed soundtrack for both games and more multimedia. In December 2002, Type-Moon, in association with French-Bread (known as Watanabe Seisakujo prior to 2003), released their first fighting game, Melty Blood, a PC-based doujin game based on the Tsukihime universe, which was very popular and was followed soon after by an expansion, Melty Blood Re-ACT, released in May 2004, to which a patch update, Melty Blood Re-ACT Final Tuned, was released as a free download over the Internet. Melty Blood is widely considered among the best doujin 2D fighting games ever made, and has been released as an arcade port, Melty Blood: Act Cadenza, in March 2005, and was released on the PS2 platform in August 2006. Type-Moon soon transitioned from a doujin soft organization to a commercial organization, and on 30 January 2004, released their first commercial release, a PC-based eroge visual novel game, Fate/stay night, which broke all records on its opening day and became immensely popular. It was later adapted into an anime series that aired 24 episodes in Japan starting 6 January 2006; a second anime series that premiered in October 2014; and a manga series that ran in publication between 26 December 2005 and 26 October 2012, in Monthly Shounen Ace. A sequel to Fate/stay night, Fate/hollow ataraxia, was released on 28 October 2005. Fate/stay night was also released on the PS2 platform in May 2007. A prequel, Fate/Zero, was released as a light novel written by Gen Urobuchi (from nitro+) under Kinoko Nasu's supervision, featuring art by Takashi Takeuchi, in 2006‚Äì2007, followed by an animated adaptation by ufotable in 2011‚Äì2012. At Comiket 72 in 2007, they released the \\"All Around TYPE-MOON drama CD\\". In August 2019, Type Moon announced that they established a new company called Type-Moon Studio BB, a video game development studio with former Square Enix and Atlus employee Kazuya Nino, who was a director for the series Trauma Center, Etrian Odyssey and Dragon Quest Builders as the head of the studio. According to Nino, the company plans to make medium to large-scale 3D games developed in cooperation with external developers, and small-scale 2D games developed in-house.

The song, a spirited march written by George M. Cohan, is a tribute to the U.S. flag. In addition to obvious references to the flag, it incorporates snippets of other popular songs, including one of his own. Cohan wrote it in 1906 for his stage musical George Washington, Jr. History The song was first publicly performed on February 6, the play's opening night, at Herald Square Theater in New York City. \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\" quickly became the first song from a musical to sell over a million copies of sheet music. The title and first lyric comes from someone Cohan once met; the Library of Congress website notes. \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\", would become one of the most popular American marching-band pieces of all time. In the play itself, the scene with the Civil War soldier was replicated. The soldier's comment was the lead-in to this song. Thus, the first version of the chorus began, \\"You're a grand old rag / You're a high- flying flag\\". Despite Cohan's efforts to pull that version, some artists such as Billy Murray had recorded it under its original title, \\"The Grand Old Rag\\", in advance of the play's opening, and copies under that title still circulate among collectors. Cohan's second attempt at writing the chorus began, \\"You're a grand old flag / Though you're torn to a rag\\". The final version, with its redundant rhyme, is as shown below. Today, many different arrangements of the song exist. In particular, Paul V. Yoder's arrangement of \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\" is a version commonly used today by the U.S. military in its performances of the song.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiHHmTN- Rhc%20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xpKWCe44Bo Lyrics ;Verse 1 :There's a feeling comes a-stealing, :And it sets my brain a-reeling, :When I'm list'ning to the music of a military band. :Any tune like \\"Yankee Doodle\\" :Simply sets me off my noodle, :It's that patriotic something that no one can understand. :\\"Way down South, in the land of cotton,\\" :Melody untiring, :Ain't that inspiring? :Hurrah!

He is perhaps best known for his work on the staff of Stephen Long's expedition to the Great Lakes in 1823, an account of which he published in 1824. In the account he first hypothesized the existence of what is now known as Lake Agassiz. Formed at the end of the last ice age during the retreat of the great North American glaciers Lake Agassiz was, at its peak, much larger than any currently existing lake. The tremendous significance of the discovery has come to be appreciated in recent decades because the draining of Lake Agassiz into the North Atlantic Ocean is now generally thought to have been responsible for sudden periods of cooling of Northern Hemisphere climate at the end of the Pleistocene. The most dramatic of these periods of cooling is known as the Younger Dryas.

Born Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft 1919, 21, 679-685.F. Haber Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft 1919, 21, 750-768. It was also independently formulated by Kasimir FajansK. Fajans Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft 1919, 21, 714-722. and published concurrently in the same issue of the same journal. The cycle is concerned with the formation of an ionic compound from the reaction of a metal (often a Group I or Group II element) with a halogen or other non-metallic element such as oxygen. Born‚ÄìHaber cycles are used primarily as a means of calculating lattice energy (or more precisely enthalpyThe difference between energy and enthalpy is very small and the two terms are interchanged freely in this article.), which cannot otherwise be measured directly. The lattice enthalpy is the enthalpy change involved in the formation of an ionic compound from gaseous ions (an exothermic process), or sometimes defined as the energy to break the ionic compound into gaseous ions (an endothermic process). A Born‚ÄìHaber cycle applies Hess's law to calculate the lattice enthalpy by comparing the standard enthalpy change of formation of the ionic compound (from the elements) to the enthalpy required to make gaseous ions from the elements. This latter calculation is complex. To make gaseous ions from elements it is necessary to atomise the elements (turn each into gaseous atoms) and then to ionise the atoms. If the element is normally a molecule then we first have to consider its bond dissociation enthalpy (see also bond energy). The energy required to remove one or more electrons to make a cation is a sum of successive ionization energies; for example, the energy needed to form Mg2+ is the ionization energy required to remove the first electron from Mg, plus the ionization energy required to remove the second electron from Mg+. Electron affinity is defined as the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion. The Born‚ÄìHaber cycle applies only to fully ionic solids such as certain alkali halides. Most compounds include covalent and ionic contributions to chemical bonding and to the lattice energy, which is represented by an extended Born-Haber thermodynamic cycle.H. Heinz and U. W. Suter Journal of Physical Chemistry B 2004, 108, 18341-18352. The extended Born‚ÄìHaber cycle can be used to estimate the polarity and the atomic charges of polar compounds. Examples =Formation of LiF= Born‚ÄìHaber cycle for the standard enthalpy change of formation of lithium fluoride. ŒîHlatt corresponds to UL in the text. The downward arrow \\"electron affinity\\" shows the negative quantity ‚ÄìEAF, since EAF is usually defined as positive. The enthalpy of formation of lithium fluoride (LiF) from its elements lithium and fluorine in their stable forms is modeled in five steps in the diagram: # Enthalpy change of atomization enthalpy of lithium # Ionization enthalpy of lithium # Atomization enthalpy of fluorine # Electron affinity of fluorine # Lattice enthalpy The same calculation applies for any metal other than lithium or any non-metal other than fluorine. The sum of the energies for each step of the process must equal the enthalpy of formation of the metal and non-metal, \\\\Delta H_{f}. :\\\\Delta H_{f} = V + \\\\frac{1}{2}B + \\\\mathit{IE}_\\\\ce{M} - \\\\ce{EA}_\\\\ce{X} + U_L * is the enthalpy of sublimation for metal atoms (lithium) * is the bond energy (of F2).

Instead, the lattice energy is calculated by subtracting the other four energies in the Born‚ÄìHaber cycle from the net enthalpy of formation.Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs. Chemistry: The Molecular Science. 3rd edition. 2008. . pages 320‚Äì321. The word cycle refers to the fact that one can also equate to zero the total enthalpy change for a cyclic process, starting and ending with LiF(s) in the example. This leads to : 0 = - \\\\Delta H_{f} + V + \\\\frac{1}{2}B + \\\\mathit{IE}_\\\\ce{M} - \\\\mathit{EA}_\\\\ce{X} + U_L which is equivalent to the previous equation. =Formation of NaBr= When Na is solid and Br2 is liquid, heat of vaporization is added to the equation: :\\\\Delta H_{f} = V + \\\\frac{1}{2}B + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Delta_{vap}H + \\\\mathit{IE}_\\\\ce{M} - \\\\ce{EA}_\\\\ce{X} + U_L *\\\\Delta_{vap}H is the enthalpy of vaporization of Br2 in kJ/mol.

The Noyyal River is a small river in Western Tamil Nadu, and a tributary of Kaveri River. It rises from the Vellingiri hills in the Western Ghats in Tamil Nadu, very close to Kerala border, and flows through many villages and the cities of Coimbatore, and Tirupur finally draining into the Kaveri River at Noyyal, a village in Karur district named after the river itself. The river's basin is long and wide and covers a total area of . Cultivated land in the basin amounts to while the population density is 120 people per km¬≤ (311/mi¬≤) in the countryside, and 1000 people per km¬≤ (2590/mi¬≤) in the cities. The area is known for its scanty rainfall and the development of the Noyyal River Tanks System to hold any overflow from the rains plus the water of the Northeast and Southwest monsoon season was ecologically important. The long tributary of the Kaveri River filled 32 tanks. These interconnecting tanks held the water flowing from the Noyyal. Ecology The township of Coimbatore once was surrounded by the Noyyal river and its canals, tanks, and rivulets. The Noyyal river and its interconnected tank and canal system, believed to have been originally built by the Chalukya Cholas kings, was then an efficient system that provided water transport, storage, and maintained stable groundwater levels. Surplus water from the Noyyal river spilled into the canals and were channeled to the tanks, preventing unwanted flooding. The tanks were a major factor in replenishing the ground water through percolation of the subsoil water. As urbanisation grew, the system was neglected and the number of functional tanks was drastically reduced until only eleven were left. Today the system no longer works and water is scarce. Agriculture has significantly decreased. Lacking irrigation water, lakhs of Coconut trees in the area have dried up. History The \\"Noyyal\\" is a sacred river in Tamil history. Its original name was Kanchinadi but changed later to the name of the place where it drains into the Kaveri River in 1750 A.D. The Noyyal village is situated at the banks of Noyyal and Kaveri (Ponni) rivers where they both merge. An ancient temple to the goddess Sellandiyamman is also situated at Sangamam. Pollution A critical issue is the pollution of the rivers Noyyal and Nallaru originating and flowing in the Kongu Nadu region. The river flows with natural antibiotic minerals. The entire Orathuppalayam Dam has become a tank holding effluent and releases water after every rainfall, effectively polluting the down river villages in the Tirupur and Karur district. However, from 2004 onwards, efforts by local volunteers organization Siruthuli have been trying to conserve the water resource. After several petitions from 2003 to 2011, dying and bleaching units were ordered closed on the river until zero liquid discharge status was achieved. On 9 July 2018, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu announced that a sum of Rs. 150 crores would be earmarked for preventing pollution in of Noyyal within Tirupur city limits. Geography The Cheyyar River and the Kanchimanadhi are the tributaries to the river. They all have their origins in the Western Ghats. Periar flows out of the Siruvani hills and the Kovai Kuttralam, a landmark waterfalls. Chadiaar or Cheyyar River flows through Chaadivayal and later along with the other rivers join up at Kooduthurai to become Noyyal River. After running through a distance of , Noyyal joins with river Cauvery near Kodumudi, the place is also called Noyyal, Karur District. Apart from these three rivers, there are numerous rivulets that also join Noyyal. But most of these rivulets carry water only during the rainy season and therefore are not perennial. According to the available sources, the number of rivulets are 34. The river has a valley fill (made of alluvial kankar soil) over a stretch of and a depth of . It extends from the origin of the river at Kooduthurai (in Madhvarayapuram, west of the city) to the Ukkadam Tank on the city border. The fill absorbs water like a sponge. Only when the absorption reaches a saturation point does excess water flow to the suburbs and the city. Dams and reservoirs Noyyal contains two major dam Orathuppalayam (Near Chennimalai) and Aathupalayam Dam (Near Vellakoil) commissioned in the aim of irrigating about 20,000 acres of land in Tirupur and Karur districts. As of now Orathuppalayam dam stands decommissioned and acting as effluent tank for the Tirupur textile units. The river has 23 check dams. Decades ago, it irrigated .

The bottom 23 floors of the tower are for commercial use and above it are luxury apartments, which increase in size the higher they are. Soon after the building's completion, residents of nearby buildings complained of hearing a loud whistling noise which, it later turned out, came from the wind blowing through the decorative dome at the building's top. The city threatened daily fines for the noise, which lasted for more than a year. Developers silenced the whistle by removing every other louver in the cooling tower, thereby widening the narrow channels through which the wind whistled. The Moorish- inspired dome, which is a homage to the adjacent New York City Center on West 55th Street, is illuminated at night with a white light. The building has an unusual octagonal shape. CitySpire Center is part of a cluster of four tall towers along with the Carnegie Hall Tower (which mimics the design of its famous namesake concert hall), the Metropolitan Tower and One57.

William Sawtrey, also known as William Salter (died March 1401) was an English Roman Catholic priest who was executed for heresy. Sawtrey was born in Norfolk, England. He was a follower of John Wycliffe, the leader of an early reformation movement called Lollardy. Sawtrey was a priest at two churches, St. Margaret's in Lynn and Tilney in Norfolk. Sawtrey's association with Lollardy Sawtrey preached and endorsed Lollard beliefs, including the rejection of Catholic saints and the sacrament of Eucharist. Of the latter, he claimed that \\"after the consecration [of the host] by the priest there remaineth true material bread\\" (Trevelyan 334). As a result of spreading these views, Sawtrey was taken to Henry le Despenser on 30 April 1399. Le Despenser, a bishop then based in North Elmham, ordered an examination of Sawtrey. The examination lasted for two days. Sawtrey's examiners claimed that he rejected free will, and that he did not believe in venerating images and embarking on pilgrimages. He was therefore charged with heresy and sent to an Episcopal prison. Sawtrey denounced Lollardy upon his release. He abjured privately at first, but then publicly in Lynn on 25 May 1399. He appeared before le Despenser in St. John's Hospital the next day, and swore on the Gospels that he would never again preach Lollardy. He also promised to never hear confession without a license from le Despenser. In 1401, Sawtrey moved to London and began working as a parish-priest at St. Osyth's, where he continued to preach Lollard beliefs. It is possible that he moved to London in order to distance himself from le Despenser, but he had not removed himself from the anti-Lollard sentiment of the Catholic Church. One year earlier, De heretico comburendo (Statute of Heresies) was passed. The statute called for the burning of heretics either plainly rejecting Catholicism, or accepting Catholic beliefs but returning to their previous heretical beliefs. Sawtrey was summoned to appear at St. Paul's on 12 February 1401. Sawtrey appeared before Archbishop Thomas Arundel. Before convocation, Sawtrey was delivered the following heretical charges: failure to \\"adore the true cross\\" (National Biography 869), belief that a priest's time spent in hourly prayers could be better spent preaching and spreading the word of God, his opinion on the temporalities of the church and on how the money could be put to better use, preaching on adoration of mankind over angels, and finally his belief in consubstantiation. Sawtrey resisted, and was once again charged with heresy. Sawtrey demanded a copy of his charges and was given 18 February to make an appeal. At his appeal before Parliament he defended his beliefs with quotes from St. John, St. Paul, and St. Augustine. His defence was heavily questioned by Arundel, who spent three hours questioning of the topic of the Eucharist alone, all the while trying to convert him back to Catholicism. Sawtrey resisted, and on 23 February charges were once again made against him. He was condemned and \\"through seven successive stages he was degraded from priest to doorkeeper, then stripped of every clerical function, attribute, and vestment\\". Vol. 50 p. 381. Sawtrey was convicted and sentenced to death on 26 February 1401. In March, he was taken to Smithfield and publicly burned at the stake. He was the first follower of Lollardy to die for his beliefs. He and John Purvey, a friend and follower of John Wycliffe who also was tortured for his beliefs, were the two most egregious cases against Lollardy committed under the Statute of Heresy. Aftereffects The lower classes of England were quick to catch on to Lollard ideas, especially about disbursing Church funds to aid people in need and to ease lower class financial stresses caused by heavy taxation. The representatives of the lower class made efforts on two occasions to convince King Henry IV and Parliament to appropriate the Church's money and to use it for the people of England. The Church reacted against this proposal and, with the help of the King, set forth a number of statutes to protect Church temporalities. Among these orders was the statute De heretico comburendo, which stated that heresy was punishable by means of public burning. The severity of Sawtrey and Purvey's punishments created a wave of Lollard supporters. Among them was John Oldcastle, a knight and captain for the Prince of Wales. He protected and hid preachers from the Statute of Heresy. Oldcastle and other Lollard-sympathizing knights pleaded with King Henry IV to change the law. They argued that the King should take the money the Church was wasting and put it into England's armoury, almshouses, and universities. Many students of Oxford University were also Lollard sympathizers. Students translated Wycliffe's work and began to debate the lawfulness of Bible translations. However, despite their efforts, the persecution of Lollards continued. The knights' arguments were shot down, and Oxford was discredited by the Church. Nevertheless, Lollard believers continued practising their faith in an underground network below the Church's radar. Other supporters After John Wycliffe's death, Archbishop William Courtenay began to defend his beliefs in 1382. He argued concepts such as consubstantiation, the belief that the Eucharist is still indeed bread and that body of Christ exists simultaneously with the bread. He also used the Bible to explain that certain mass ceremonies were not specifically ordered by Christ. He defended the belief that, \\"a priest in mortal sin could not administer the Sacraments.\\" He also supported Wycliffe in his opinion about confession, which was that if a man is truly contrite after his verbal confession, then no other action is necessary. The final point he argued was that of papacy. In his life Wycliffe had proposed that Pope Urban VI should be the last pope and that people govern themselves under their own laws.

Her father, Malik Ghulam Jilani, was a civil servant who entered politics upon retirement and spent years both in jail and under house arrest for opposing military dictatorships. Malik was imprisoned on several occasions for his outspoken views, which included denouncing the Pakistani government for genocide during their military action in what is now Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan). Her mother, Begum Sabiha Jilani (1927‚Äì2012), was educated at a co-ed college named Forman Christian College situated in Lahore, at a time when few Muslim women even received higher education. Sabiha also fought the traditional system, pioneering her own clothing business until her family's lands were confiscated in 1967 as a result of her husband's opinions and detention.EuropaWorld 9/3/2001 Jahangir herself became involved at a young age in protests against the military regime as well as opposing her father's detention by then president, Benazir Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1972.

Jahangir was a staunch critic of the Hudood Ordinance and blasphemy laws of Pakistan put in place as part of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization program in Pakistan.Prize winner 2002: Asma Jahangir Asma Jahangir by Laila Kazmi She was a founding member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, and served as Secretary-General and later Chairperson of the organisation. In 1980, Jahangir and her sister, Hina Jilani, got together with fellow activists and lawyers to form the first law firm established by women in Pakistan. In the same year they also helped form the Women‚Äôs Action Forum (WAF), a pressure group campaigning against Pakistan's discriminatory legislation, most notably against the Proposed Law of Evidence, where the value of a woman's testimony was reduced to half that of a man's testimony, and the Hadood Ordinances, where victims of rape had to prove their innocence or else face punishment themselves.Women and Children: The Human Rights Relationship ‚Äì Asia On 12 February 1983, the Punjab Women Lawyers Association in Lahore organised a public protest (one of its leaders was Jahangir) against the Proposed Law of Evidence, during which Jahangir and other participating WAF members were beaten, teargassed, and arrested by police.Fight Hudood, Protect Women By Beena Sarwar The first WAF demonstration, however, took place in 1983 when some 25‚Äì50 women took to the streets protesting the controversial case of Safia Bibi. In 1983, Safia, a blind 13-year-old girl, was raped by her employers, and as a result became pregnant, yet ended up in jail charged with fornication (zina) sentenced to flogging, three years of imprisonment and fined. Jahangir defended Safia in her appeal and eventually the verdict was over-ruled by an appeals court due to pressure and protests.Swat The System They would say: \\"We [their law firm] had been given a lot of cases by the advocate general and the moment this demonstration came to light, the cases were taken away from us.\\"Dawn ‚Äì The Reviewer, 2 April 1998, \\"A ray of hope\\" by Muneeza Shamsie In 1982, Jahangir earned the nickname \\"little heroine\\" after leading a protest march in Islamabad against a decision by then-president Zia-ul-Haq to enforce religious laws and stated: \\"Family laws [which are religious laws] give women few rights\\" and that \\"They have to be reformed because Pakistan cannot live in isolation. We cannot remain shackled while other women progress\\".Asma Jahangir , Retrieved 16 March 2016 In 1986, Jahangir and Hina set up AGHS Legal Aid, the first free legal aid centre in Pakistan. The AGHS Legal Aid Cell in Lahore also runs a shelter for women, called 'Dastak', looked after by her secretary Munib Ahmed.Asma Jahangir and Hina Jilani She was also a proponent of protecting the rights of persecuted religious minorities in Pakistan and spoke out against forced conversions.Democracy is Survival for Women Jahangir campaigned against human rights abuses taking place in government and police custody in Pakistan. In a letter to The New York Times, she said that \\"Women are arrested, raped and sexually assaulted every day in the presence of female constables, who find themselves helpless in such situations\\".The New York Times, letter to the editor, 23 September 1992. Cited in . In 1996, the Lahore High Court ruled that an adult Muslim woman could not get married without the consent of her male guardian (wali). Women, who chose their husbands independently, could be forced to annul their marriages and the repercussions were highlighted by Jahangir, who also took on such cases (i.e. the case of Saima Waheed);Book: Muslim women and the politics of participation by Mahnaz Afkhami, Erika FriedlPolice exploiting LHC ruling, apex court told: Delay in Saima case affected 250 couples: Asma \\"Hundreds have already been arrested. This is simply going to open up the floodgates for the harassment of women and girls by their families and the authorities. The courts have sanctioned their oppression. Thousands more are bound to be affected by this.\\"A beacon in Islam's dark age By Yasmin Alibhai-Brown 22 October 1996 Jahangir demanded that the government of Parvez Musharraf work to improve the record of human rights domestically. Citing examples of human rights abuses, she wrote, \\"A Hindu income tax inspector gets lynched in the presence of the army personnel for allegedly having made a remark on the beard of a trader. Promptly, the unfortunate Hindu government servant is booked for having committed blasphemy, while the traders and the Lashkar-e-Taiba activists were offered tea over parleys. A seventy-year-old Mukhtaran Bibi and her pregnant daughter Samina are languishing in Sheikhupura jail on trumped-up charges of blasphemy\\".Whither are we? She was also an active opponent of child labour and capital punishment: \\"It would be hypocrisy to defend laws I don't believe in, like capital punishment, the blasphemy law and laws against women and in favor of child labor.\\" Asma Jahangir served as the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions from 1998 to 2004, and as the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief from 2004 to 2010. In her capacity as a UN official, Jahangir was in Pakistan, when Pervez Musharraf declared a state of emergency in 2007. In November 2006, she participated the international meeting for The Yogyakarta Principles as one of 29 experts. On 5 November 2007, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour indicated that Jahangir was among the judicial and political officials detained by the Musharraf government., Retrieved 16 March 2016 On 18 January 2017, Jahangir became the first Pakistani to deliver the 2017 Amartya Sen Lecture at the London School of Economics, where she called for a counter-narrative of liberal politics to challenge religious intolerance. She added that there was a \\"large scale impunity\\" among those who commit crimes in the name of religion, and this has to be addressed at the national as well as the international levels, the rights activist said. \\"In 1986, Pakistan got the blasphemy law. So, while we had just two cases of blasphemy before that year, now we have thousands. It shows that one should be careful while bringing religion into legislation, because the law itself can become an instrument of persecution,\\" she added. In August 2017, Jahangir represented the families of terror convicts sentenced to death by military tribunals before the Supreme Court in Said Zaman Khan v. Federation of Pakistan. Jahangir asked order retrial in all cases in which military courts handed down convictions, including capital punishments, but the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the sentence of the convicts on 29 August 2017. Asma spoke against the five member Supreme Court judgment which deposed Nawaz Sharif from his premiership. She questioned why members of Inter Services Intelligence and Military intelligence were inducted in Joint Investigation team ferreting out corruption by Sharif's family and his close companions. She questioned how the Panama case five judges would have felt if members of the ISI and MI were inducted in Supreme Judicial Council, a body authorised to punish erring judges. Earlier she had suggested that ousted prime minister would get no relief from Supreme Court but from coming on streets. In December 2017, Jahangir called for a probe by a parliamentary committee to ascertain as to who was behind the recent Faizabad sit-in. She questioned \\"We need to know how the army became a guarantor during the agreement between the government and protesters. Why money was distributed among the protesters,\\". In her last case before the Supreme Court, Jahangir appeared for former Member of the National Assembly Rai Hasan Nawaz in Sami Ullah Baloch v. Abdul Karim Nousherwani in February 2018. She argued that there should not be a constant period of electoral disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, but courts should decide the question according to the conduct of individuals. She said the Supreme Court had held Nawaz Sharif eligible to contest elections in 2009 by deeming him sadiq and ameen, but now it was difficult to understand whether the court had increased the bar of honesty or reduced it. = House arrest = On 5 November 2007, The Economist reported that \\"Over 500 lawyers, opposition politicians and human rights activists have been arrested. They include Asma Jahangir, boss of the country's human-rights commission and a former UN special rapporteur.

She was found not guilty of blasphemy. Declan Walsh, writing for The Guardian, described Jahangir's career as \\"for almost four decades she has towered over Pakistan's human rights war.\\" Adding that \\"she has championed battered wives, rescued teenagers from death row, defended people accused of blasphemy, and sought justice for the victims of honour killings. These battles have won her admirers and enemies in great number.\\" Abbas Nasir has described her as the \\"gutsiest woman that Pakistan has\\". William Dalrymple, writing for The New Yorker, described Jahangir as Pakistan's \\"most visible and celebrated‚Äîas well as most vilified‚Äîhuman-rights lawyer\\", adding that she has \\"spent her professional life fighting for a secular civil society, challenging the mullahs and generals.\\" Several conservative and nationalist commenters have written extensively against Jahangir.

The ANPP had several accomplishments, but ultimately it was considered to be \\"a solution in search of a problem.\\" The U.S. Army Engineer Reactors Group managed this program and it was headquartered at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The program began in 1954 and had effectively terminated by about 1977, with the last class of NPP operators graduating in 1977. Work continued for some time thereafter either for decommissioning of the plants or placing them into SAFSTOR (long term storage and monitoring before decommissioning). The current development of small modular reactors has led to a renewed interest in military applications.COL Paul E. Roege - Can nuclear energy fill critical gaps in the military energy portfolio? @ TEAC3 - YouTube Background There was interest in the possible application of nuclear power to land-based military needs as early as 1952. A memo from the Secretary of Defense, dated 10 February 1954, assigned the Army the responsibility for \\"developing nuclear power plants to supply heat and electricity at remote and relatively inaccessible military installations.\\" The Secretary of the Army established the Army Nuclear Power Program and assigned it to the Corps of Engineers.Army Nuclear Power Program: Past, Present, Future. A briefing document prepared and presented to the Ad Hoc Study Group of the Army Scientific Advisory Panel, 10‚Äì11 February 1969 The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 made the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) responsible for R&D; in the nuclear field, so that the ANPP then became a joint interagency 'activity' of the Department of the Army (DA) and the AEC. When the Atomic Energy Act was revised in 1954, Paragraph 91b authorized the Department of Defense to obtain special nuclear material for use in defense utilization facilities. The focus of the Army Nuclear Power Program was on power production facilities while the Naval Reactors Program concentrated on nuclear propulsion for submarines and ships. On 9 April 1954 the Chief of Engineers established the US Army Engineer Reactors Group to perform the missions assigned by DA. Essentially, these missions were to: * conduct R&D;, with the AEC, on nuclear power plant development; * operate the Corps of Engineers nuclear power plants; * carry out training in support of the plants; * provide technical support to other agencies as required; * develop programs for application of nuclear reactors to military needs. In a Department of the Army Approved Qualitative Materiel Development Objective for Nuclear Power Plants, dated 7 January 1965, these objectives were stated for the program: * Reduction or elimination of dependence on [fossil] fuel sources. * Reduction or elimination of logistic burden necessary to support conventional power plants. * Reliable operation. * Infrequent refueling and maintenance. * Reduced crew size, with ultimate goal of unattended operation. * Transportability, mobility, and reaction times compatible with the mission or equipment to be supported. * Improved cost-effectiveness. The AEC ultimately concluded that the probability of achieving the objectives of the Army Nuclear Power Program in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost was not high enough to justify continued funding of its portion of projects to develop small, stationary, and mobile reactors. Cutbacks in military funding for long- range research and development because of the Vietnam War led the AEC to phase out its support of the program in 1966. The costs of developing and producing compact nuclear power plants were so high that they could be justified only if the reactor had a unique capability and filled a clearly defined objective backed by DOD. After that, the Army's participation in nuclear power plant research and development efforts steadily declined and eventually stopped altogether.Pfeffer, Macon, Nuclear Power: An Option for the Army's Future, Army Logistician, PB 700-01-5, Vol 33, Issue 5, Sept/Oct 2001, retrieved from on January 30, 2009 List of plants Eight plants were constructed. Due to the requirement for a small physical size, all these reactors other than the MH-1A used highly enriched uranium (HEU). The MH-1A had more space to work with, and more weight-carrying capacity, so this was a low-enrichment reactor; i.e., larger and heavier. The MH-1A was briefly considered for use in Vietnam, but the idea of anything nuclear in Vietnam was quickly rejected by the State Department. The plants are listed in order of their initial criticality. See the gallery of photos in the next section. Sources for this data include the only known book on the ANPP, by Suid,Suid, L. H., The Army's Nuclear Power Program: The Evolution of a Support Agency, Greenwood (1990), and a DOE document. SM-1 Ft. Belvoir Virginia * SM-1: 2 MW electric. Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Initial criticality April 8, 1957 (several months before the Shippingport Reactor) and the first U.S. nuclear power plant to be connected to an electrical grid. Used primarily for training and testing, rather than power generation for Ft. Belvoir. The plant was designed by the American Locomotive Company (renamed ALCO Products, in 1955), and was the first reactor developed under the Army Nuclear Power Program. See the SM-1 image gallery, below. This plant was a tri-service training facility, with both the US Navy and Air Force sending personnel to be trained on shore-based facilities (the Navy had a different stand-alone program for ship-based nuclear power, which is still in operation). The SM-1 and associated training facilities at Ft. Belvoir were the only training facility for shore-based military power plants. The plant cooled its condensers using the waters of the Potomac River. For about the first 10 years of its operation, the SM-1 unknowingly released tritium into the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, until the development of the Packard Tri- Carb detector, which was the first detector system capable of detecting the low-energy beta decay of tritium. The instrumentation in the SM-1 pre-dated the development of solid-state devices and used vacuum tubes. SL-1 NRTS, Idaho * SL-1: Boiling water reactor, 200 kW electrical, 400 kW thermal for heating, National Reactor Testing Station, Idaho. Initial criticality August 11, 1958. The SL-1 was designed by the Argonne National Laboratory to gain experience in boiling water reactor operations, develop performance characteristics, train military crews, and test components. Combustion Engineering was awarded a contract by the AEC to operate the SL-1 and in turn employed the Army's military operating crew to continue running the plant. This BWR was specifically designed to power DEW line stations. :On January 3, 1961, the reactor was being prepared for restart after a shutdown of eleven days over the holidays. Maintenance procedures were in progress, which required the main central control rod to be manually withdrawn a few inches to reconnect it to its drive mechanism; at 9:01 p.m. this rod was suddenly withdrawn too far, causing SL-1 to go prompt critical instantly. In four milliseconds, the heat generated by the resulting enormous power surge caused water surrounding the core to begin to explosively vaporize. The water vapor caused a pressure wave to strike the top of the reactor vessel, causing water and steam to spray from the top of the vessel. This extreme form of water hammer propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upwards. A later investigation concluded that the vessel had jumped and the upper control rod drive mechanisms had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location. Chapter 15. The spray of water and steam knocked two operators onto the floor, killing one and severely injuring another. One of the shield plugs on top of the reactor vessel impaled the third man through his groin and exited his shoulder, pinning him to the ceiling. The victims were Army Specialists John A. Byrnes (age 27) and Richard Leroy McKinley (age 22), and Navy Seabee Construction Electrician First Class (CE1) Richard C. Legg (age 26). :It was later established that Byrnes (the reactor operator) had lifted the rod and caused the excursion, Legg (the shift supervisor) was standing on top of the reactor vessel and was impaled and pinned to the ceiling, and McKinley, the trainee who stood nearby, was later found alive by rescuers. All three men succumbed to injuries from physical trauma; the radiation from the nuclear excursion would have given the men no chance of survival. :This was the only fatal incident at a US nuclear power reactor, which destroyed the reactor. This incident was important in the development of commercial power because future designs prevented the core from going critical with the removal of a single rod. PM-2A Camp Century, Greenland * PM-2A: 2 MW electric, plus heating. Camp Century, Greenland. Initial criticality October 3, 1960. The first \\"portable\\" nuclear power reactor. Brought to Greenland in parts, assembled, operated, disassembled, shipped back to United States.PM-2A The PM-2A in Camp Century, Greenland, was designed by the American Locomotive Company to demonstrate the ability to assemble a nuclear power plant from prefabricated components in a remote, arctic location. The pressure vessel was subsequently used to investigate neutron embrittlement in carbon steel. This plant was shut down 1963-1964\\\\. PM-2A operated at a uranium-235 enrichment of 93 percent.Atomic Energy, Volume 9, Number 4 - SpringerLink * ML-1: first closed cycle gas turbine. Initial criticality was on March 30, 1961. Designed for 300 kW, but only achieved 140 kW. Operated for only a few hundred hours of testing. The ML-1 was designed by Aerojet General Corporation to test an integrated reactor package that was transportable by military semi-trailers, railroad flatcars, and barges. This reactor was shut down in 1965. PM-1 Nuclear Power Plant, Sundance Air Force Station * PM-1: 1.25 MW electric, plus heating. Sundance Air Force Station, Wyoming. Owned by the Air Force, this pressurized water reactor was used to power a radar station. Initial criticality was on February 25, 1962. The PM-1 was designed by the Martin Company and provided electric power to the 731st Radar Squadron of the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD). This plant was shut down in 1968. PM-1 operated at a uranium-235 enrichment of 93 percent. CHARACTERISTICS OF PM-1 (SUNDANCE) PM-3A McMurdo Station, Antarctica * PM-3A: 1.75 MW electric, plus heating and desalinization. McMurdo Station, Antarctica.Antarctic Environmental Awareness Pages Owned by the Navy. Initial criticality March 3, 1962, decommissioned 1972. The PM-3A, located at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, was designed by the Martin Company to provide electric power and steam heating to the Naval Air Facility at McMurdo Sound. PM-3A operated at a uranium-235 enrichment of 93 percent. The PM-3A (Portable, Medium-power, 3rd generation) was a plant installed to provide power for the McMurdo Base in Antarctica. During 1970-1971, it achieved a world-record power run. It was one of the first shore-based power plants to use solid-state equipment. The PM-3A was not operated by the Army, but was under the NAVFAC (Naval Facilities Engineering Command), shore-based power division of the US Navy. Although the majority of the personnel were Navy, the PM-3A was a tri-service stationing. For 1970-1971, there was an Army Sergeant and an Air Force Sergeant stationed with the crew. The plant was air- cooled with the condensers and fan units running glycol. Waste heat was also used for desalination using vacuum flash distillation. The reactor was located in buried tanks in the ground. The plant suffered from a multitude of problems, including a fire and coolant leakage. It was shut down in Sep. 1972. After decommissioning, the plant was cut into pieces and transported to the US for burial. The soil surrounding the tanks had become radioactive, so it was also removed and transported to Port Hueneme Naval Base, California, where it was incorporated into asphalt pavement. SM-1A Ft. Greely, Alaska * SM-1A: 2 MW electric, plus heating. Fort Greely, Alaska. Initial criticality March 13, 1962. The SM-1A at Ft. Greely, Alaska, was designed by ALCO Products and was the first field facility developed under the Army Nuclear Power Program. This site was selected to develop construction methods in a remote, Arctic location. This plant was shut down in 1972. SM-1A operated at a uranium-235 enrichment of 93 percent. MH-1A Power Barge Sturgis, Gunston Cove, Ft. Belvoir, MH-1A control room simulator * MH-1A: 10 MW electric, plus fresh water supply to the adjacent base. Mounted on the Sturgis, a barge (no propulsion systems) converted from a Liberty ship, and moored in the Panama Canal Zone. Initial criticality at Ft. Belvoir (in Gunston Cove, off the Potomac River), January 24, 1967. It was the last of the eight plants to permanently cease operation. The MH-1A was designed by Martin Marietta Corporation. It remained moored at Gatun Lake in the Panama Canal from 1968 until 1977, when it was towed back to Ft. Belvoir for decommissioning. It was moved to the James River Reserve Fleet in 1978 for an expected 50 years of SAFSTOR. This reactor used low-enrichment uranium (LEU) in the range of 4 to 7 percent. The MH-1A had an elaborate analog-computer- powered simulator installed at the Training Division, USAERG, Ft. Belvoir. The MH-1A simulator was obtained by Memphis State University Center for Nuclear Studies in the early 1980s, but was never restored or returned to operational service. Its fate is unknown after the Center for Nuclear Studies closed. * MM-1: ~2.5 MW electric, Conceptualized but never built. Conceived as the \\"Military Compact Reactor\\". A truck mounted liquid metal cooled reactor, with shorter start up and shut down times. Requiring no shielding of Earth or exclusion zones to protect the operators from radiation. With its reactor core containing the energy equivalent of over 8 million pounds of gasoline. Envisioned to have higher power density; its power output meant for the first time the powerplant would weigh less than a diesel generator of comparable output. While initially meant to power bases and field operations, the program was shifted to the Army's \\"Energy Depot Concept\\" to investigate the production of synthetic fuels. The reactor and associated trailers would produce liquid fuels for tanks, trucks, armored personnel carriers, and aircraft and drastically reduce the vulnerable petroleum logistical supply chain. The associated trailers would use chemical conversion processes to convert the reactor's waste heat energy into useful fuels using elements universally found in air and water (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon), potentially producing methanol, liquid hydrogen and/or ammonia. Key to the codes: * First letter: S - stationary, M - mobile, P - portable. * Second letter: H - high power, M - medium power, L - low power. * Digit: Sequence number. * Third letter: A indicates field installation.

The company is headquartered in Grapevine, Texas, United States, a suburb of Fort Worth, and operated 5,509 retail stores throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe as of February 1, 2020.http://sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000022/a10k-fy19q4.htm The company's retail stores primarily operate under the GameStop, EB Games, ThinkGeek and Micromania-Zing brands. In addition to retail stores, GameStop also owns Game Informer, a video game magazine. GameStop has been the subject of criticism over the years in response to several of its policies. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the company was criticized for their stores remaining open to customers, a decision that was later reversed the following month in response to the negative feedback. History Logo of retailer Software, Etc. on a 5.25\\" floppy disk branded by the company =Babbage's (1984‚Äì1994)= GameStop traces its roots to Babbage's, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin. The company was named after Charles Babbage and opened its first store in Dallas's North Park Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company. The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600. Babbage's began selling Nintendo games in 1987. The company went public in 1988. By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage's sales. =NeoStar Retail Group (1994‚Äì1996)= Babbage's merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994. The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams. Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage's president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. President Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar's executive committee. Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage's in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatteo, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin's duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO. The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year. NeoStar merged its Babbage's and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president. In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory necessary for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. With the filing, NeoStar board member Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman and James McCurry remained company chief executive and president. The leadership changes were not enough and in November 1996 the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes & Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar's bankruptcy accepted Riggio's bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique's bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed. =Babbage's Etc. (1996‚Äì1999)= Following his purchase of NeoStar's assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage's Etc. He appointed Richard \\"Dick\\" Fontaine, previously Software Etc.'s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.'s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO. Three years later, in 1999, Babbage's Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores located in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage's and Software Etc. stores. =Barnes & Noble Booksellers (1999‚Äì2004)= Gamestop shop front inside Bentley Mall, Fairbanks, Alaska. Barnes & Noble Booksellers purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million. Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble Booksellers evaluated and signed off on the deal. A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million. Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco. With its acquisition of Funco (also known as FuncoLand),https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/why-some-of-us-will-miss- gamestop-when-its-gone/ Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991. Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company. Barnes & Noble Booksellers took GameStop public with a February 2002 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. GameStop was listed under the ticker symbol GME. Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company. =GameStop's successful years (2004‚Äì2016)= A store in Hillsboro, Oregon GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) in 2005 for $1.44 billion. The acquisition expanded GameStop's operations into Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Two years later, in 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. Rhino Video Games operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States. GameStop purchased Free Record Shop's Norwegian stores in April 2008. The company acquired 49 stores and converted them into video game shops. Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company's chairman. J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September. GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video-game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video-game stores. It also acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser-based game studio, in November 2009. Jolt closed in 2012. J. Paul Raines became GameStop CEO in June 2010. He replaced Daniel DeMatteo who was named executive chairman of the company. While serving as CEO in 2012, GameStop's digital revenue grew from $190 million in 2011 to more than $600 million in 2012. GameStop acquired Kongregate, a San Francisco, California- based website for browser-based games; terms of the deal were not disclosed. GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse in separate transactions during 2011. Spawn Labs was a developer of technology that allowed users to play video games that were run remotely on machines in data centers rather than their personal computer or console. Impulse was a digital distribution and multiplayer gaming platform. GameStop closed Spawn Labs in 2014. GameStop purchased BuyMyTronics, a Denver, Colorado-based online market place for consumer electronics, in 2012. Later that year, it acquired a minority interest in Simply Mac, a Utah-based authorized Apple reseller. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Simply Mac in November 2013. GameStop also acquired Spring Mobile, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based retailer of AT&T-branded; wireless services, in November 2013. They obtained 163 RadioShack locations as of February 26, 2015, as well. All GameStop stores have been closed down in Puerto Rico at the end of March 2016, citing increased rates of government taxes. On August 3, 2016, it acquired 507 AT&T; store chains in plans to diversify into new businesses and less dependent on the video game market. =Decline (2016‚Äìpresent)= Changes in market conditions The market for physical game media has been in a state of decline since online services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Nintendo eShop, and Steam, all of which offer downloadable digital versions of games, have taken foothold. GameStop, whose business was long rooted in new and pre- owned software, has begun feeling the effects of the changing market. In 2017, GameStop reported a 16.4% drop in sales for the 2016 holiday season, but expressed optimism in its non-physical gaming businesses. Reasons cited for the decline in sales included industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure, and lower in-store traffic. Financial losses Shares of GameStop stock fell 16% throughout 2016. On February 28, 2017, shares dropped an additional 8% following Microsoft's announcement of its Xbox Game Pass service. Following these reports, GameStop announced it would close over 150 stores in 2017 and expand its nongaming business. On the same day, however, GameStop said it planned to open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores due to a 44% and 28% increase in sales, respectively. GameStop expects a continued drop in operating income between 3% and 10% in 2017. GameStop's total revenue fell 7.6% to $3.06 billion in the quarter ended February 2. Analysts had estimated revenue of $3.28 billion. (The fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 contained 13 weeks of operating results compared to 14 weeks in fiscal 2017.) In late June 2018, GameStop confirmed talks of a possible sale, with Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm in New York, the most likely buyer, with a target deal expected by February 2019. However, on January 29, 2019, GameStop reported it had stopped looking for a buyer for the company, due to a \\"lack of available financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquirer\\", and was looking for other actions to help re-establish its financial ground. Shares dropped 27% to a 14-year low immediately following this announcement. The financial results for 2018 showed the biggest loss in GameStop company history. For the 52-week period ending on February 2, 2019, GameStop reported a record-breaking net loss of $673 million.http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop- reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2018-results-and This was a change from the net profit of $34.7 million in the previous year. The net sales for fiscal year 2018 were down year-on-year to $8.29 billion, a decrease of 3 percent. Management changes Paul Raines notified GameStop of his resignation on January 31, 2018. Raines had been on medical leave since November 2017. He had a medical reoccurrence of a brain tumor, and later died on March 4, 2018. DeMatteo, GameStop's executive chairman stepped in as interim chief executive officer. On February 6, 2018, the company announced Michael K. Mauler as the new CEO and new member of the board of directors. On May 11, 2018, Mauler resigned due to \\"personal reasons\\" and chairman Dan DeMatteo was named interim CEO. Mauler did not take any severance package or separation benefits. On May 31, 2018, GameStop named Shane Kim as interim CEO. Kim was replaced by George Sherman in March 2019. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that a group of shareholders including Hestia Capital Partners LP and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP sent a \\"threat\\" letter to the Grapevine, Texas, company's board, urging it to appoint a stockholder representative as a director.https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-under-renewed-pressure-from- unhappy-investor-group-11583990600 Turnaround efforts In July 2019, GameStop partnered with an outside design firm, R/GA, to put forth plans to revamp stores to focus on competitive gaming and retrogaming, and to introduce new ways for customers to try games before buying them. Each concept store is expected to be mutually exclusive. A leaked email revealed on July 31, 2019, indicated that 50 employees, including district and regional managers, would be laid off as a result of reorganization efforts. Later, in August 2019, GameStop laid off over 120 positions, including about half of the staff of Game Informer as part of their \\"GameStop Reboot initiative to transform our business for the future and improve our financial performance\\". In August 2019, Michael Burry's investment firm Scion Asset Management sent a letter to GameStop urging the company to engage in a portion of stock buybacks. The letter also revealed that Scion currently owns approximately 2,750,000 shares, or about 3.05% of GME. GME, which has been in steady decline in share price since late January 2019, saw a spike of roughly 20% after Burry revealed that he's going long on the stock in an interview with Barrons. In the interview, Burry explained that both Sony and Microsoft will enter the next console generation with a physical disc drive and therefore likely extend the longevity of GameStop. He also noted that the company's balance sheet was in good condition. However, he later went on to lower his stake in GameStop stock. After reporting that it has missed analysts' expectations during their 2nd quarter of the fiscal year 2019 ending August 2019, as reported in September 2019, GameStop announced that it plans to close about 180‚Äì200 underperforming stores of the 5,700 it had worldwide in short term, along with developing metrics to evaluate other potential closures over the next two years. In March 2020, four members of GameStop's Board of Directors - Dan DeMatteo, Gerald Szczepanski, Larry Zilavy, and Steve Koonin - stepped down and were replaced by Reggie Fils-Aim√©, Bill Simon and J.K. Symancyk as part of the company's effort to turn around the business. The COVID-19 pandemic forced GameStop to close the physical operation of all of it 3,500 stores from roughly March to May 2020, though not without some controversy in the early stages, though it was still able to handle online and curbside sales. Sherman and the board of the directors took a 50% pay cut while other executives took a 30% to offset losses, While digital sales grew by 519%, its retail dropped by more than 30% in the same period from the prior year, and the chain reported a loss in contrast to a for the same quarter in 2019. However, with the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 still planned for release in the latter part of 2020, Sherman expected to be able to recover from these losses. On October 8, 2020, GameStop announced an agreement with Microsoft to migrate backend systems to Microsoft 365 platforms including Dynamics 365, also including in-store usage of Microsoft Surface products by employees. It was later reported that this agreement would also include revenue sharing on all digital game purchases for Xbox Series X and S for each product sold by the retailer, although the exact percentage of this share was not disclosed.  Operations  GameStop is divided into two operating segments: Video Game Brands and Technology Brands. The Technology Brands segment was created during the fourth quarter of 2013 and houses the companies Simply Mac, Spring Mobile, and Cricket Wireless. As of April 2014, the Technology Brands segment included 218 retail outlets. GameStop's Video Game Brands segment includes the company's other businesses such as video game and consumer electronics retail shops; Kongregate, a digital video game distribution site; and buymytronics.com, a consumer electronics marketplace. Pre-owned and value video games accounted for 47% of GameStop's gross revenue for the fiscal year ending February 2014. Owned brands and concepts =Game Informer= Game Informer is a magazine owned by GameStop, Inc. and primarily sold through subscriptions which can be purchased at GameStop locations. Purchasing a subscription to the magazine also gets the subscriber the PowerUp Rewards Pro card, a premium version of GameStop's loyalty card. This increases all store- credit trade values by 10%, discounts all used accessories and games by 10%, gives new PowerUp members a coupon for \\"Buy 2 Get 1 Free\\" on pre-owned games and accessories, enters them twice for the Epic Rewards Giveaway for each purchase, gives the cardholder opportunities to gain points with their purchases, and redeem them for rewards and gains them access to special content on the Game Informer website. = GameStop PC = GameStop PC Downloads formerly called Impulse, is a digital distribution service run and operated by GameStop. Originally known as Impulse when owned by Stardock, it was sold to GameStop in 2011 and rebranded as GameStop PC Downloads, with the Impulse client renamed as the GameStop App. Under the ownership of GameStop, the service has had a redesign and sells games that use other platforms such as Steam while also selling games that use its own proprietary DRM solution Impulse:Reactor. =Trade-ins= GameStop sells games that are traded in for store credit. This practice has come under fire from game publishers and developers as they make no money from the transaction. =GameStop TV= GameStop TV is the in-store television network run internally by GameStop, with non-endemic sales in partnership with Playwire Media, Inc. GameStop TV features programming designed to speak to the consumers shopping in GameStop stores. Each month brings content segments about upcoming video game releases, exclusive developer interviews, product demonstrations and more. =Pre-order bonuses= Game publishers have begun to obtain more pre-orders by including exclusive in-game or physical bonuses, available only if the player pre- ordered the game. Bonuses typically include extras such as exclusive characters, weapons, and maps. For example, GameStop included an additional avatar costume for Call of Duty: Black Ops when it was released in November 2010, and a pictorial Art-Folio for Metroid: Other M. Soundtracks, artbooks, plushies, figurines, posters, and T-shirts have also been special bonuses. =MovieStop= GameStop founded MovieStop in 2004 as a standalone store that focused on new and used movies. More than 40 locations were opened, which typically adjoined or were adjacent to GameStop locations. GameStop spun off MovieStop to private owners in 2012. In November 2014, Draw Another Circle LLC, a company controlled by merchandising executive Joel Weinshanker that also owns Hastings Entertainment, purchased MovieStop. The chain shuttered in 2016. =GameStop Kids= In October 2012 at Grapevine Mills in Dallas, GameStop introduced a new store concept known as GameStop Kids. The brand focus on children's products, and carried only games rated \\"Everyone\\" by the ESRB, along with merchandise of popular franchises aimed towards the demographic. The locations opened in 80 malls as pop-up stores for the holiday shopping season. =GameTrust Games= In January 2016, GameStop announced a partnership it had made with Insomniac Games with their 2016 title Song of the Deep. GameStop executive Mark Stanley said the concept was to help the chain have more direct communication with players, and would expect to expand out to other similar distribution deals with other developers if this one succeeds. Subsequently, in April 2016, GameStop announced that it was formally creating the GameTrust Games publishing division within the company to serve as a publisher for mid-sized developers. In addition to Insomniac Games, GameTrust Games announced they were working with Ready At Dawn, Tequila Works, and Frozenbyte to prepare more titles to be published by the end of 2016. =Simply Mac= In October 2012, GameStop acquired a 49.9% minority equity ownership interest in the Salt Lake City-based Apple authorized reseller and repairer Simply Mac. Simply Mac was founded in Salt Lake City in 2006. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% that it did not own in November 2013. GameStop tried to target areas for potential new Simply Mac locations in slight smaller markets that did not have an existing Apple Store within a reasonable driving distance. In January 2017, GameStop closed a large number of Simply Mac locations. The chain had as many as 70 locations at the time of the announcement. After the closings, a few recently vacated Simply Mac locations were replaced by sister company ThinkGeek. Criticism =Opened copies of game titles= The company has a policy where some copies of newly released games are opened and the game discs stored behind the counter so the cases can be put on display. Purchasers of the game receive a factory-sealed copy unless the opened copy is the last copy of the game in stock, where they'll receive the opened copy sold at regular price. GameStop's check-out policy allows employees \\"to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days\\", with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content. This checkout policy does not apply to new as well as used merchandise, but sometimes managers abuse this system and it does happen, which has been a hotly contested practice among the community. GameStop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution on OnLive, a cloud gaming service. GameStop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had acquired in April 2011. Later, GameStop entirely removed the PC version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution from its stores. Square Enix, the publisher of Deus Ex, said that it \\"respects the right of GameStop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies\\". =Used games market= GameStop has been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles. By reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game, it is argued that GameStop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue. In effect, this means that companies such as GameStop can resell used copies of a game within days of the title's release and keep all of the profit, thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers. =Fingerprint identification= It was revealed in early August 2014 that GameStop was required by the Philadelphia Police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at Philadelphia GameStop locations. The policy had been in place since early July of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of Philadelphia. This caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area. Philadelphia Police asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves. By August 4, 2014, the policy had been reversed in all Philadelphia-area GameStop stores. =Circle of Life policy= In February 2017, it was revealed that GameStop enforced, on all of its retail employees, a program known as Circle of Life. The policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allow a certain percentage of their sales to pre-orders, rewards cards, used games, or have a customer trade in a game. Upon revelation of the policy, many GameStop employees including current and former, brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers. Many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress. Later into the month, GameStop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis, though still maintaining a heavy emphasis on the individuals' performance to maintain strong store metrics. = COVID-19 pandemic response = In mid-March 2020, GameStop faced criticism for its response to the coronavirus pandemic in North America, with employees and social media users accusing the company of placing its business ahead of the safety of its staff and customers, in order to capitalize on an influx of video game purchases and related products for entertainment during the pandemic and related lockdowns. GameStop stated that it would suspend in-store events (including midnight launches) and the use of demo stations, perform additional cleaning, and structure lines and limit store capacity to enforce physical distancing. In order to prevent enlarged crowds for two high-profile video game releases on March 20 ‚Äî Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Doom Eternal, GameStop announced that it would begin selling Doom Eternal in its stores a day ahead of its official release date. Polygon reported on March 17 that several stores in the San Francisco area had remained open, seemingly in violation of a stay-at-home order issued by Bay Area counties that restricts non-essential business. Several employees told Polygon and Vice that they did not receive additional cleaning supplies that were to be provided by corporate, requiring them to purchase them on their own and request reimbursement. In regards to orders restricting non-essential businesses, a memo obtained by Kotaku on March 19 indicated that GameStop saw itself as an essential business because some of its technology products are relevant to enhancing remote work (a practice that has seen expansion due to the pandemic). In a statement later that day, GameStop reiterated the safety measures that it had put in place, and also announced that it would reduce store hours and suspend all trade-ins until at least March 29, and offer curbside pickup. The company stated that it aimed to \\"continue to provide essential products to our customers that allows them to stay connected, and provide products that allow business and consumers to work remotely\\", as they were serving the \\"significant need for technology solutions\\" at this point in time. An employee of a GameStop store in Athens, Georgia (which was shut down on March 20 by order of the police to comply with a similar order in Athens- Clark County) disputed the argument, saying that the high-end, gaming-oriented peripherals (such as keyboards and mice) sold at GameStop were not necessarily essential for remote work, and that cheaper alternatives were readily available at stores allowed to remain open, such as Walmart. California had announced a state-wide stay-at-home order on March 19; while GameStop had originally stated to its stores it was an essential retail business, by March 20 they had instead decided to close down its California branches, while keeping most other nationwide stores open. Following similar stay-at-home orders in New York and Illinois over the following days, GameStop announced that it would close all locations effective March 22, with selected locations continuing to offer contact-free curbside pickup (where an employee, wearing either gloves or a bag over their hands, would slip the customer's order through the front door, remaining behind the glass) and home delivery. In early April, a location in Dorchester, Boston received a nuisance citation by local police, who deemed the curbside pickup a violation of the Massachusetts stay-at-home order. GameStop subsequently ceased offering curbside pickup in the state. GameStop's Canadian subsidiary EB Games faced similar criticism on March 20 as well, as morning lineups for the new Animal Crossing and Doom games at a Toronto location induced large public gatherings discouraged by officials. The city's public health chief Eileen de Villa stated that the gathering did not \\"line up with what we expect from those in our community who are interested in protecting and strengthening our community\\". Mayor John Tory accused the company of \\"plac[ing] commerce above the public interest\\", while Premier of Ontario Doug Ford stated that \\"everyone in this province has a responsibility to make sure we protect each other and I am very, very disappointed in the store owner that would do this\\". EB Games later announced that it would close all Canadian stores on March 21.

The book's premise is that a good software program or web site should let users accomplish their intended tasks as easily and directly as possible. Krug points out that people are good at satisficing, or taking the first available solution to their problem, so design should take advantage of this. He frequently cites Amazon.com as an example of a well-designed web site that manages to allow high-quality interaction, even though the web site gets bigger and more complex every day.

It started in 1961 and features the letters of viewers offering praise, criticism and observations on BBC television programmes of recent weeks. The current series is being narrated by Tina Daheley. History Points of View began in 1961 with Robert Robinson presenting viewers' letters to the BBC. It was originally designed as an occasional five-minute \\"filler\\" to plug gaps between shows. A critic for the Daily Herald wrote \\"I believe this marks an important turning point in the BBC's attitude to its audience\\". The series was regarded cynically by the public as some believed most of the letters were written by the BBC themselves. Kenneth Robinson (1925‚Äì1994) took over in 1965, though Robert Robinson returned in 1969 before the show was dropped in 1971. During the 1960s there was also a spin-off, Junior Points of View. The show returned in 1979 after a hiatus of eight years, with the dry humour of Barry Took at the helm. Originally only being broadcast in the London area as a five-minute filler part of the regional programming, by 1980 it was broadcast across the whole of the UK. Took left in 1986 and was replaced by guest presenters including Tony Robinson, Alan Titchmarsh and Chris Serle, until Anne Robinson took over as presenter in 1987. For many years during this period, the programme held a slot of 20:50 on Wednesday evenings. In 1997 Anne Robinson left the series to concentrate on Watchdog. In September 1999, Points of View was moved to a Sunday early evening slot presented by Terry Wogan and now included emails in addition to letters and telephone calls. In the 2007 series, Points of View featured diverse films, such as students from Sussex University making a passionate plea for the BBC to keep the soap opera Neighbours, John Leivers interviewing Roly Keating (the controller of BBC Two) on the channel's direction, and Jill Parkinson asking why there aren't more people with disabilities featured in BBC programmes. In 2008 Jeremy Vine became the regular presenter of the series. From April 2013, production switched to BBC Northern Ireland. On the last show of the present series on 1 July 2018, Vine announced his retirement from the show. In order to refresh the series, which will return in the autumn, and allow more time for audience feedback the show will no longer be presenter-led. Public perception The show has been seen as representing a certain passive-aggressive aspect of British culture; Victoria Wood once said \\"When the Russians feel strongly about an issue they form a bloody revolution ‚Äì the British write a strongly worded letter to Points of View\\". Although, much less common now, the show has over the decades featured many a letter beginning \\"Why, oh why, oh why...\\" and signed \\"Upset of Uxbridge\\" or \\"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\", or something similar (these days, most, if not all, simply use their real names). Along the way the show has catered for those who wish to see particular parts of programmes again, featuring letters asking \\"Please, please, please could you show the clip where Vera Lynn sang to the troops on the 50th anniversary of D-Day last week\\", and the like. The series has been criticised for featuring too much praise of the BBC and its programmes, and playing down criticism. This tendency has been sent up by many comedians over the years, including memorable skits in Monty Python's Flying Circus and Not the Nine O'Clock News. In the latter, positive letters said such things as \\"I think the (television licence) fee is far too low. I would willingly sell my house and all its contents to help the BBC.\\" Further criticism came from comedians Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie in their sketch comedy show A Bit of Fry and Laurie. In a sketch where Fry had supposedly removed Laurie's brain, Laurie said that he was \\"off to write a letter to Points of View\\". In a later episode, a woman claims she has had two letters read out on Points of View, and that \\"they say if you get three, you're automatically sectioned under the Mental Health Act.\\" The programme became (around 1994) the first BBC TV show to invite contributions by email, and at one point, its producer Bernard Newnham had the only Internet connection in BBC Television Centre.

Theme The original theme tune to the programme was the first 13 seconds of Kid Ory's trad jazz piece \\"Yaaka Hula Hickey Dula\\", played by the Dutch Swing College Band. When the series returned in 1979 a new piece called \\"Northern soul\\" was used before switching in 1983 to adopted The Beatles' \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" as its theme tune (because of the lyric \\"Send me a postcard, drop me a line, stating point of view\\"). This was dropped by the early 90s. In 2003, a bespoke acapella theme tune, entitled \\"Blah Blah\\" or \\"Blah Boopity Baya\\" was introduced, alongside a new title sequence featuring members of the public talking to a screen showing BBC programmes, set against a black background with streaks of light flying past. The composers and performers involved in the creation of this theme tune are unknown. In 2009, the theme gained notoriety when it was featured on BBC Radio 6 Music's Adam and Joe radio show, with the presenters mocking the theme tune's upbeat sound compared to the overall serious tone of Points of View at the time (then presented by Jeremy Vine), adding that \\"the BBC's been in some quite serious trouble of late, so this is just a suggestion to our colleagues at the castle [BBC Television Centre]... you might want to change that music\\". In 2011, an alternative mix of the previous theme came into use, with the acapella vocals being swapped for a synthesiser and background strings.

Background  Hebrard studied at the √âcole des Beaux- Arts, and in 1904 won the Grand Prix de Rome, allowing him to study at the Acad√©mie de France in Rome, located in the Villa Medici. It was here that he chose to study Diocletian's palace at Split, eventually leading to the 1912 publication of a monograph containing what is still regarded as the most accurate image of the original appearance of the Palace. At the Academie, he was a few years behind Henri Prost, later famed as the planner of Casablanca, and together with other members of the reformist Mus√©e social, he developed an interest in the possibilities of town planning. Work in Greece During WW1, in 1916, Hebrard had been conscripted as the Director of the Archaeological Service of the Army of the Orient based in Thessaloniki, and so was present when the majority of the city was largely destroyed in the Great Fire of 1917. The Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos forbade the reconstruction of the city center until a modern city plan was approved. He commissioned Ernest H√©brard for the work, which the architect conceived and developed with the aid of the Greek architects Aristotelis Zachos and Konstantinos Kitsikis, as well as British designer Thomas Hayton Mawson and fellow Frenchman Joseph Pleyber. The plan did away with the medieval and Ottoman street layout, imposing instead a plan of formal boulevards, in a symmetrical pattern about a central axis, carefully composed around the most important ancient Byzantine churches and mosques. H√©brard taught at the National Technical University of Athens, and his work is well known in the architecture schools of Greece. Work in Indochina In 1921, he was appointed the head of the Indochina Architecture and Town Planning Service, based in Hanoi, the capital of French Indochina, at first charged with planning the hill station of Da Lat in Annam, Vietnam's middle province. He participated in the planning new districts or urban improvements of several other cities in the region, including Hanoi itself. He also designed a number of prominent buildings, including the eclectically styled Martyr's Church, popularly known as the C·ª≠a B·∫Øc Church, in central Hanoi in the late 1920s (completed c1931The Vietnamese Wikipedia attributes to the design to the church priest Fr Antoine Depaulis.), but he is particularly noted for a series of government buildings that worked to incorporate elements of vernacular design from French Indochina into modern structures. They include : * Hanoi University of Pharmacy, originally the Hanoi Medical University, built 1926. * Ministry of Foreign Affairs, originally built as the Indochina Ministry of Finance, 1924-28. *National Museum of Vietnamese History, originally the French School of the Far East, built 1926-31, and intended to house the archeological collections of the school. *L√™ H·ªìng Phong High School, originally Lycee Petrus K√Ω, District 5, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City, 1925-28. *Hotel Le Royal, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, proposed 1924, opened 1929 (with Jean Desbois). In 1930, he presented a project for the building of a university in Salonika, and in 1931 he returned to Paris, where he died at the age of 58 two years later. 4G4A7753 HDR.jpg|Martyr's Church, C·ª≠a B·∫Øc Church, c1929-31 VNU lethanhtong 900x600.jpg|Hanoi Medical University, now Hanoi University of Pharmacy, 1926 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hanoi, 1928 (2) (37781035864).jpg|Indochina Ministry of Finance now Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1924-28 B√¢timents 172.jpg|French School of the Far East now National Museum of Vietnamese History, 1928-32 Tr∆∞·ªùng Trung H·ªçc Petrus K√Ω.jpg|Lycee Petrus K√Ω now L√™ H·ªìng Phong High School, 1925-28 LeRoyal PP.jpg|hotel Le Royal, Phnom Penh, 1924-29 See also Aristotelous Square References French urban planners French archaeologists 1875 births 1933 deaths Architects from Paris Modern history of Thessaloniki Architecture of Greece 20th-century French architects Architecture of Thessaloniki Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery National Technical University of Athens faculty ","title":"Ernest H√©brard"},{"id":"994670","text":"The Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) is an Iranian state-run news outlet. History and profile Iranian Students News Agency was established in December 1999 in order to report on news from Iranian universities. It now covers a variety of national and international topics.Engber, Daniel. \\" What's With the Iranian Students News Agency?\\", Slate, 2 February 2006. Retrieved 7 February 2007. Editors and correspondents are themselves students in a variety of subjects, many of them are volunteers (nearly 1000). ISNA is considered by Western media to be one of the most independent and moderate media organizations in Iran, and is often quoted.\\"Bombs boost town's Taleban support\\", BBC News, 6 November 2001. Retrieved 7 February 2007. \\"While taking a reformist view of events, ISNA has managed to remain politically independent. It has, however, maintained its loyalty to the former president and carries a section devoted to \\"Khatami's perspectives\\". Although it is generally considered independent, the ISNA is financially supported in part by the Iranian government and is supported by ACECR (Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research), another student organization. The agency's main founder and first director Abolfazl Fateh, who resigned in late 2005, was taken to the court on several occasions, including for a report on Shirin Ebadi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist. Also, once he was beaten by police while supporting his correspondents to report student demonstration in June 2003. According to the Guardian, reformist daily Aftab-e Yazd 14 June 2003, in its Editorial column wrote: \\"It is not easy to overlook the injury caused to Dr Abolfazl Fateh, the hardworking managing director of the Iranian Students' News Agency, who had come to the scene to ensure an accurate reporting of events and prevent any news distortion by foreign media... [His] greatest concern was that if the people do not receive the news from us, they would do so from our enemies or at best from our competitors.\\".'Standing up to this regime takes courage', The Guardian, 17 June 2003. In January 2005 a server called The Planet unilaterally stopped hosting the website of the ISNA. The ISNA said that they did not receive a reason for the closure, and had only been informed 48 hours before the move. An Iranian government official later accused the United States of ordering the shutdown. The incident led to new calls for Iran to develop its own satellite communication technology.\\"US accused after Iran site closed\\", BBC News, 24 January 2005. Retrieved 7 February 2007. After Abolfazl Fateh's resignation in September 2005, Mehdi Nad'alizadeh, ISNA's head of political news was appointed as ISNA's director. He was replaced by Hamid Hasan - Zadeh in 2007 . They were the only directors who were appointed from ISNA's editors. However, from 2008 till now, all directors have been appointed from outside the ISNA but most were a member of the ACECR.. Abolfazl Fateh in his PhD thesis, defended in 2011 at University of Oxford\\" entitled \\"the Power of News Production\\" stated about ISNA (Iranian Student News Agency),\\"During this period [1999-2005], ISNA turned into a major source of news, information and content in the Iranian media, attracting the attention of journalists, media experts and academics. Although the reasons for this strong attention may vary among these groups ‚Äî from ISNA‚Äôs political impact to its peculiarities as a news agency ‚Äî perhaps the common denominator among all of them was that ISNA presented a novelty on the Iranian (and to some degree, global) media scene. In a society that seemingly had experience of major changes initiated by unofficial media, as had happened during the Islamic Revolution (Sreberny- Mohammadi 1990), or by few periodicals and a newspaper with a small circulation together with student activists, as had happened during the reform movement (KhƒÅniki 1998), this news source had and demonstrated the potential to bring about a considerable change in Iran‚Äôs media content and its functions. ISNA may not be framed as a news agency or fit a specific model; however, it was a symbol of the media that \\"reflect and direct at the same time\\" (Deuze 2009, p. 457). Meanwhile, the Thesis confirms \\"ISNA suffered from certain shortcomings having to do with how it operates -- for example, not operating twenty four hours a day; not presenting news according to established professional standards; not having a multilingual website; having educational, editorial and technological weaknesses; focusing on domestic activities and news, and not having vast regional or international branches; and, most importantly, financial dependence on the government. Moreover, despite its honesty, fairness, and accuracy, the agency could not demonstrate itself as an impartial news agency particularly in later years of the period when it pumped out reform idealism and combined news activities with cyber activism. Therefore,... ISNA perhaps cannot be characterized as a member of the media with the highest journalistic values and professional standards. However, under the circumstances that prevailed at the time, it would be safe to say that it provided the best possible and strategic way to set up a relatively reliable but constant information flow in the country during this period\\". As indicated in the thesis, \\"Regardless of any fate that the agency [ISNA] faces in the future..., it is clearly evident that ISNA, in the context of the Iranian media sphere and in comparison with other news sources in the country [during the period in between 1999-2005], rose as a new media phenomenon. This unique student news agency created a range of innovatory and influential journalistic work. All of these characteristics emerged while ISNA was affiliated with a revolutionary organization like ACECR. This affiliation raises the question as to whether ISNA represents a mutation in the revolutionary organizations in the country\\". The thesis statement added, \\"ISNA was a new idea that turned into a reality and added another dimension to the news agency‚Äôs mission in the country. The study reminds us of the importance and significance of news agencies in a region where they are not considered important or powerful players. As such, it introduces a workable model that can be potentially replicated in the region\\". As Fateh's thesis explained, \\"ISNA represents a unique type of journalism and a unique form of media organization that combined distinctive elements of local and global characteristics in its inception and operation. It is difficult to frame ISNA as a news agency or claim that the agency ‚Äúfits a model‚Äù. At one level ISNA can probably be seen as a hybrid of participatory and traditional journalism and at another level as a hybrid organization that bridged the gap between competent journalism and cyber activism or cyber politics. In a serious way, ISNA defined its own model of a news agency, while at the same time acting as a social maverick and providing a mould for civic participation. These unique characteristics explain the success and impact of ISNA on the media scene in Iran, providing the key to its early development and survival. As such, in a rather direct way, ISNA embodied the socio-politics of Iran, with its deep heterogeneity and perhaps contradictions. It symbolizes a period of Iranian contemporary history in its rich complexity\\".Fateh, Abolfazl 2011, \\"The Power of News Production\\", PhD thesis, University of Oxford.

Barton Springs Pool is a recreational outdoor swimming pool that is filled entirely with water from nearby natural springs. It is located on the grounds of Zilker Park in Austin, Texas. The pool exists within the channel of Barton Creek and utilizes water from Main Barton Spring, the fourth largest spring in Texas. The pool is a popular venue for year-round swimming, as its temperature hovers between about and year round. http://fitness.blog.mystatesman.com/2017/07/13/whats-the-real- temperature-at-barton-springs-pool-hint-its-not-68-degrees/  History  Long before Barton Springs Pool was built, the springs were considered sacred and were used for purification rituals by the Tonkawa Native American tribe who inhabited the area. Spanish explorers first found the springs in the 17th century, and around 1730 erected temporary missions at the site (later moving to San Antonio). In 1837, soon after incorporation of the city of Austin, William (\\"Uncle Billy\\") Barton, the springs' namesake, settled the area. Barton named the three separate springs after his three daughters: Parthenia, Eliza, and Zenobia. He, and subsequent owners of the property, recognized its value as a tourist attraction, and promoted it vigorously, thus leading to the swimming hole's lasting popularity. The last private owner of the property, Andrew Jackson Zilker, deeded it to Austin in 1918. During the 1920s, the city undertook a construction project to create a larger swimming area by damming the springs and building sidewalks. The bathhouse was designed in 1947 by Dan Driscoll, who also designed the bathhouse at Deep Eddy Pool.  Operation of the pool  Stairs leading to Barton Springs Pool The pool is usually open to the public from 5:00am to 10:00pm, Friday through Wednesday. During this time, the floodgates on the pool's dam are closed, and Main Barton Spring fills the pool to a maximum depth of more than 18 feet. At the upper end of the pool, another dam prevents surface water from Barton Creek from entering the pool by diverting it through a tunnel under the sidewalks. Although admission to the pool is free from November through mid March, from mid March to October a small fee ($1 to $8 for residents of Austin) is charged for entry after 8:00am. Every evening after 9:00pm during the charging season, admission is free until closing. Summer passes, valid from Memorial Day to Labor Day, are also available. Barton Springs Pool Lifeguards are usually present except before 8:00am, when swimmers are cautioned to \\"swim at your own risk\\".\\"City of Austin\\" Accessed: 7-20-2011. The pool is surrounded by grassy slopes and beautiful trees with plenty of shade. Items prohibited from entering the facility include coolers, food, non-resealable beverages other than water, glass containers, alcohol, loud speakers, pets other than service animals, and bicycles. Flotation devices are permitted at either end of the pool, but not allowed in the middle. On Thursdays, the pool is closed for cleaning from 9:00am until 7:00pm. The floodgates are sometimes partially opened, lowering the water level in the pool by several feet. Employees then buff or blast pressured water against the limestone bottom of the pool's shallow end, as well as the steps and ramps leading into the water, in order to wash away the hazardous and slippery algae buildup. In the deep end, a fire hose is used to push debris toward the downstream dam. Overgrown vegetation is also trimmed on cleaning days. Once a year the pool is closed for several weeks for more extensive cleaning. The pool is closed during flash flood warnings as Barton Creek may flood and overflow the diversion dam. Swimming in Barton Springs Pool is then unsafe, as it transforms into a raging creek. The pool is then closed for several days after a flood, so mud and debris that washed into the pool can be removed. Other unplanned reasons for pool closure include lightning or thunder in the area, \\"search and rescue\\" situations, serious medical emergencies, high fecal coliform count, and chemical spills (either inside the pool itself or over the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer).  Environmental issues  The pool has been closed to the public a number of times since the 1980s due to unsafe levels of fecal coliform (E. coli) bacteria in its waters. The source of contamination is still undetermined: many point to upstream urban development as the cause, although others note that high bacteria levels were seen in the 1950s, when development was less pervasive. Contamination is usually worse after heavy rains due to the flushing of the effluent of upstream subdivisions into the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone which feeds the springs. The environmental conditions of the springs gave birth to a local political movement called the Save Our Springs Alliance (SOS). SOS became a force in Austin municipal politics, leading to many \\"green\\" initiatives involving environmental issues in addition to those of the springs. Robert Redford, who first learned to swim at Barton Springs Pool, has also been an outspoken ally. In 2007 he and Terrence Malick co- produced The Unforeseen, a documentary highlighting environmental impact to the Edwards aquifer from the surrounding real estate subdivision. Another environmental issue involving the springs and the pool emerged with the discovery of the Barton Springs salamander, a federally listed endangered or threatened species which only exists in the pool and a few surrounding environs. After some debate, and studies by the city of Austin, Texas state agencies, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it was determined that swimmers and salamanders could co-exist (as they had probably been doing for some time).

The programme is a parody of British middle class newspapers, in particular the lifestyle supplements and glossy celebrity magazines that fill Sunday papers. The programme consists of a series of short sketches that dramatise the articles in the eponymous newspaper, with the cast assuming accents to convey the characters of the journalists or columnists. The articles are presented in the format of a British Sunday newspaper, with the copy distributed in columns across the body of the paper, and commonly feature lists of items or instructions. Sketches are broken up, and often use backing music which also stops and starts along with the reading of the column. This leads to a surreal, Dadaist juxtaposition of sketches, with jokes being set up at the beginning of the episode and the punchline being delivered at a random point before the end.  Conception  The show was first heard in 1996 in a one-off pilot episode. It did not return until a four-part series aired in Feb/Mar 1999, followed by six episodes in Nov/Dec 2000, and three additional four-part series in Sep/Oct 2001, Jan 2003 and Jan/Feb 2004.

He is best known for his tenure with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he was a one time Tag Team Champion with Road Warrior Animal as a part of the 2005 version of the Legion of Doom. American football career Prior to professional wrestling, Heidenreich played American football and was invited to training camp prior to the 1992 season by the defending Super Bowl XXVI Champion Washington Redskins as an undrafted rookie offensive tackle out of Northeast Louisiana University, which later became University of Louisiana at Monroe in 1999. Heidenreich was among the first round of roster cuts by Head Coach Joe Gibbs on July 27, 1992. One week before training camp began in July 1993, Heidenreich signed with the New Orleans Saints and outspoken Head Coach Jim E. Mora. Mora had liked what he saw in Heidenreich during a late-June tryout to fill a training camp roster spot while standout offensive lineman Jim Dombrowski held out until signing a five-year contract worth $11.25 million on August 13, one week before training camp ended. On the first day of camp, Heidenreich (wearing jersey #65) was involved in a fight with teammate and Saints defensive lineman Rick Dolly in the morning session. In the afternoon session, Heidenreich was involved in another skirmish when he grabbed Saints outside linebacker and 1990 first- round draft pick Renaldo Turnbull from behind and threw him to the ground after Turnbull had just beaten him on a move to the outside. Heidenreich was cut on August 24, 1993, the final day of roster cuts to meet the mandatory 60-player requirement. In July 1994, Heidenreich was invited to training camp by first-year Atlanta Falcons Head Coach June Jones. This time Heidenreich wore jersey #74 and was often tasked with blocking fellow WWE wrestler Bill Goldberg, who played defensive tackle for the Falcons from 1992 to 1994. Heidenreich was again denied a final roster spot when the Falcons cut him on the final day of roster cuts on August 23, 1994. He played as an offensive lineman for two seasons (1994 and 1995) in the Canadian Football League for the Shreveport Pirates before playing for the Texas Terror of the Arena Football League (AFL) in 1996 and the Frankfurt Galaxy of NFL Europa in 1997. Professional wrestling career =Early career (2001‚Äì2003)= Heidenreich began training at California-based Ultimate Pro Wrestling before he was first signed to a World Wrestling Federation developmental contract in 2001 after he impressed Bruce Prichard. After being released from the WWF, he wrestled in Japan's Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX promotion, where he won the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship with Nathan Jones and impressed WWE scouts, who re-signed him in 2003. =World Wrestling Entertainment (2003-2006)=  Early years (2003-2004)  Heidenreich made his World Wrestling Entertainment debut on the September 29, 2003 episode of Raw with a gimmick being \\"controlled\\" by an entity known as \\"Little Johnny\\". After weeks of trying secure a tryout match, he was finally granted one on the October 27 episode of Raw, teaming with The Hurricane to defeat La Resistance. On the November 3 episode of Raw, he teamed with Trish Stratus to defeat Victoria and Stevie Richards. Over the next month, Heidenreich remained undefeated, before his streak was snapped by Rico on the December 14 edition of Sunday Night Heat. On the February 2, 2004 episode of Heat, Heidenreich was defeated by Rob Van Dam. After wrestling a few more times, Heidenreich disappeared from WWE television around May 2004. In an interview with ThePainClinic.net in 2007, Heidenreich revealed that \\"Little Johnny\\" was actually meant to be a small doll that represented his inner child who was still angry at being born in a charity hospital. He stated that he used the character in OVW and brought the doll out to the ring with him in the same vein as Al Snow used to bring out the styrofoam head. According to Heidenreich, the angle was supposedly inspired by his own childhood where he spoke to a doll himself at one point. In 2008, former WWE writer Dan Madigan revealed that in 2004 he had pitched directly to Vince McMahon an idea to have Heidenreich return as a Nazi stormtrooper named Baron Von Bava, who had been cryogenically frozen before being revived by Paul Heyman (A Jewish son of a Holocaust survivor), complete with Heidenreich wearing the red armband with the swastika and even goose- stepping to the ring. While WWE would eventually have Heyman manage Heidenreich, the pitch was considered so shocking that McMahon left the board room speechless and didn't return for the rest of the day. The pitch led to Madigan leaving WWE later that year.  Feuding with The Undertaker (2004-2005)  Tribute to the Troops in 2004 He returned on the August 26, 2004 episode of SmackDown! as a heel under the management of Paul Heyman. His new gimmick was as a psychopath: running in during random matches, attacking fans, and reciting hateful poetry, which he referred to as \\"Disasterpieces.\\" On the September 16 episode of SmackDown!, he attacked commentator Michael Cole and dragged him to the arena restroom to sexually assault him. In a 2008 interview, Heidenreich explained that the Cole scare angle was McMahon's idea, and that Pulp Fiction came to mind when Stephanie McMahon approached him with the idea. His first feud came against The Undertaker, and began after Heidenreich ran in during Undertaker's WWE Championship match against John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield at No Mercy. Undertaker beat Heidenreich at the next month's Survivor Series, but again Heidenreich cost him a WWE Championship match at December's Armageddon when he interfered in the main event fatal four-way match not once, but twice. At WWE Tribute to the Troops on December 23, Heidenreich lost to the Undertaker via countout. On the January 6, 2005 episode of SmackDown!, Heidenreich and Heyman lost to the Undertaker in a 2-on-1 handicap match, after Heyman was pinned. After the match, Heyman was placed in a casket by the Undertaker, writing him off television. At Royal Rumble on January 30, he faced The Undertaker in a casket match. Midway through the match, Snitsky from the Raw brand interfered on Heidenreich's behalf. However, after opening the casket, it was revealed that Kane was hidden in the casket, who pounced on both Snitsky and Heidenreich; they continued their fight in the crowd, while Heidenreich lost the match. This started a chain reaction of feuds, originally planned to lead to a match at WrestleMania 21 in which The Undertaker would partner with Kane to take on Snitsky and Heidenreich. This idea was later nixed; Undertaker instead fought Randy Orton and Kane was placed into the Money in the Bank ladder match. The feud between the four instead culminated at a live event on February 6, with Undertaker and Kane getting the win. Teaming with Animal and departure (2005-2006) At No Way Out, Heidenreich lost to Booker T by disqualification after hitting Booker with a steel chair. On the March 3 episode of SmackDown!, Heidenreich faced Booker T in a rematch, which ended in a disqualification win for Heidenreich after Booker performed a DDT on a chair. Heidenreich and Booker faced once again on the March 10 episode of SmackDown! in a no disqualification match, which ended with Booker decisively defeating Heidenreich. On the March 17 episode of SmackDown!, Heidenreich read Booker a poem, thanking him for encouraging him to show the \\"real\\" Heidenreich, turning face in the process. Heidenreich participated in a 30-man battle royal at WrestleMania 21, which was won by Booker T. His \\"disasterpieces\\" became more light-hearted and began receiving cheers from the crowd. Heidenreich was then given a segment on SmackDown! in which he \\"made friends\\" with audience members, read them a piece of his poetry, and had them stand in his corner during his match. He also had a brief feud with Orlando Jordan, unsuccessfully challenging him for the United States Championship at Judgment Day. Heidenreich went on to feud with MNM (Melina, Johnny Nitro, and Joey Mercury) after they attacked him while he was eating chocolate with divas on the June 16 episode of SmackDown!. After being attacked week in and week out by the trio, he was finally helped out by Road Warrior Animal on the July 14 episode of SmackDown!. Animal and Heidenreich then challenged MNM to a match at the Great American Bash, where they defeated them to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the July 28 episode of SmackDown!, Heidenreich reluctantly shaved his hair into a mohawk at Animal's request. After Animal convinced him he wasn't looking for a \\"replacement\\" for Road Warrior Hawk, but simply a partner with talent, Animal talked him into wearing face paint and, on the August 18 SmackDown!, he was made an \\"official\\" member of the Legion of Doom and presented with a pair of Road Warrior spikes. On the October 28 episode of SmackDown!, the Road Warriors lost the Tag Team Championship back to MNM in a match also involving The Mexicools and William Regal and Paul Burchill. Heidenreich wrestled his final match, teaming up with Animal to defeat Nunzio and Vito, on the December 30 edition of Velocity. On January 17, 2006, WWE announced that Heidenreich had been released from his contract. =World Wrestling Council (2006‚Äì2007)= Heidenreich after defeating Brutus Beefcake during the Hulkamania Tour in 2009. After his run in the WWE, Heidenreich moved on to World Wrestling Council, where he defeated Abbad on October 28, 2006 to win the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship, the top title in the Puerto Rico based promotion. Two months later he lost the title to Carlito at the Lockout event. However, he was given the title back when Carlito was stripped of the title due to Carlito's contractual compromises with World Wrestling Entertainment. He lost the title a second time to Eddie Col√≥n, Carlito's brother, on January 6, 2007. =Independent circuit (2007‚Äì2009, 2016‚Äì2018)= After leaving the WWE, Heidenreich made his debut in All-American Wrestling, a Louisiana-based promotion on May 19, 2007, where he defeated J.T. Lamotta. On May 18, 2008, he teamed with Rodney Mack to defeat Latinos Locos for the promotion's Tag Team Championship. However, the title was vacated soon afterwards due to interference in the original title match. On December 14, Heidenreich won the promotion's Heavyweight Championship in a three way Loser Leaves AAW match involving then-champion The Angel of Sinn and Haniel, in which he pinned Angel to win the title. He retired from professional wrestling soon after. Heidenreich wrestled his first match since 2009, for New York-based promotion Warriors of Wrestling on June 11, 2016, against Juba. The match ended in a double disqualification. On November 12, 2017, Heidenreich won the 302 Wrestling Heavyweight Championship; however the title was immediately retired after his win. Other media Heidenreich participated in the wrestling film, Bloodstained Memoirs. He also appears as a playable character in WWE Day of Reckoning 2 and WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006. Personal life Heidenreich and his wife, Marissa, have one child: a son named Stetson Austin Heidenreich. He is fond of fast racing cars and owns Nissan GTR and Ferrari-6FI. In July 2016, Heidenreich was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018. Championships and accomplishments Despite what has been posted on various internet sites, Jon Heidenreich was not a member of the 1991 Washington Redskins Super Bowl XXVI Championship team. He was signed as a rookie free agent over three months later, in May 1992, after going undrafted in the 1992 NFL Draft. =Professional wrestling= *302 Wrestling **302 Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *All American Wrestling (Louisiana) **AAW Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **AAW Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Rodney Mack *American Wrestling Rampage **AWR No Limits Championship (1 time) *Bluegrass Championship Wrestling **BCW World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *No Limit Wrestling **NLW Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Over The Top Wrestling **OTT No Limits Championship (1 time) *Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX **NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Nathan Jones *Texas Wrestling Alliance **TWA Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Busta *World Wrestling Council **WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship (2 times) *World Wrestling Entertainment **WWE Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Road Warrior Animal References External links *Online World of Wrestling profile 1969 births American football offensive linemen American male professional wrestlers Frankfurt Galaxy players Living people Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe Warhawks football players Mississippi State Bulldogs football players Players of American football from Louisiana Professional wrestlers from California Shreveport Pirates players The Road Warriors members ","title":"Jon Heidenreich"},{"id":"994709","text":"The Garden of Mirrors is an album by Stephan Micus, released by the ECM label.

Beginnings with Victoria He made his debut for Victoria in the 1992‚Äì1993 season and soon established himself as one of the top opening batsmen in Australian domestic cricket, before progressing his way through to the Bendigo and District Cricket Association playing for the Bendigo Cricket Club in his role as an opening batsman. Test career Elliot was called up to the Australian national team in the 1996‚Äì97 season, making his Test debut against the West Indies in November 1996. Unfortunately for Elliott, in just his second Test match he was injured in a mid-pitch collision with teammate Mark Waugh, resulting in the need for knee surgery. Elliott returned for the 1997 tour of South Africa. On the Ashes series in the same year in England and scored two centuries, including a career-best 199. He also made his One Day International debut in 1997 in the Texaco Cup, but scored 1, making it his only appearance in a limited overs international. Elliott was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1998, although this wasn't enough for him to hold down a regular spot, and due to inconsistent performances after the Ashes series, he slipped out of the national team in 1999. Steve Waugh, in his autobiography, described Elliott as \\"technically gifted but temperamentally flawed\\" and \\"prone to serious bouts of self-doubt and a tendency to let injuries rule his thought processes.\\" He stated that \\"[Elliott] would have been a perfect candidate...[for] a sports psychologist.\\" He continued to perform at domestic level for Victoria and on the English county scene, and in the 2003‚Äì2004 season scored a remarkable 1381 runs in the Pura Cup, overtaking Graham Yallop's previous record (which was succeeded the very next year in 2004-05 by Michael Bevan). Rewarded with the Pura Cup Player of the Year Award and a new Cricket Australia contract, he was recalled to the national team for the first time in 5 years, albeit for one unsuccessful Test against Sri Lanka where he batted at number 3 in place of Ricky Ponting who took time off due to a family bereavement. Batting outside his normal position, Elliott scored just 0 and 1. This performance dented hopes of a resurgence in his international career greatly. In addition to this, he also had a below-par season in the subsequent 04/05 domestic season for Victoria, averaging in the mid-30s. Move to South Australia Matthew Elliott's Test career batting performance In April 2005 Elliott made a request to leave the Victorian team to join South Australia as player-coach; this was originally rejected by Cricket Victoria although Elliott appealed their decision. On 5 May a Cricket Australia grievance tribunal overturned Cricket Victoria's decision, freeing the way for Elliott to join South Australia. In the 2005-06 season Elliott struggled with injury and inconsistent form. The 2006-07 Australian domestic season was equally disappointing, with just 193 runs at 13.8 from seven first class (Pura Cup) games. As a result, he was axed from the South Australian state side. Curiously his form in the domestic one-day competition was much better with 465 runs at 51.6, highlighted by two centuries. English County Cricket On the English county scene, Elliott made a century at Lord's in the 2002 C & G final to win the trophy for Yorkshire - their first one-day trophy for 15 years. He signed a short-term contract for the 2007 season with Yorkshire CCC. This was as cover for Yorkshire's primary overseas player Younis Khan, who was due to be participating in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. However, following Pakistan's untimely exit, Younis was able to take up his role at his new county from the start of the season, thus Elliott was left surplus to requirements. Following the cancellation, Elliott agreed to join Glamorgan on a four-week deal as cover for Australian left-handed batsmen Jimmy Maher.

Lehmann made his ODI debut in 1996 and Test debut in 1998. He was on the fringes of national selection for the entirety of the 1990s, and only became a regular in the ODI team in 2001 and Test team in late 2002, before being dropped in early 2005. Primarily an aggressive left-handed batsman, Lehmann was also a part-time left arm orthodox bowler, and gained renown for his disregard for physical fitness and modern dietary regimes. He announced his retirement from first-class cricket in November 2007.Aussie star Lehmann quits playing BBC News retrieved 19 November 2007 He coached the IPL teams Deccan Chargers from 2009 to 2012 and Kings XI Punjab in 2013. He also coached Queensland during the 2010/11 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, in place of Trevor Barsby who had resigned. In June 2013, Lehmann replaced Mickey Arthur as the coach of the Australian cricket team, only two weeks before the 2013 Ashes series.\\"Ashes 2013: Cricket Australia installs Darren Lehmann as coach Mickey Arthur's replacement\\". (24 June 2013) Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved 24 June 2013. Although Australia lost that series 3-nil, Lehmann went on to coach the side to a 5-nil victory in the 2013‚Äì14 series less than five months later. Lehmann stepped down as head coach after the fourth test match against South Africa in March 2018, following the ball tampering scandal which he perpetuated that occurred during the match. He was originally thought to have been involved in the scandal, however Cricket Australia cleared him of blame at the conclusion of their investigation. Early years Of German-Australian descent, Lehmann was a junior representative for South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club Central District as well as playing cricket. Lehmann left school at the age of 16 to work on the assembly line of Holden car manufacturers in Elizabeth, South Australia. He declined selection to the first intake of the newly formed Australian Cricket Academy, a full-time cricket centre, citing his enjoyment of the factory life. Lehmann entered the first-class scene as a 17-year-old in the 1987/88 season for South Australia, playing one match against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after both Tim May and Peter Sleep were called into the national team. After making 10, Lehmann was omitted upon their return and did not play any further part in the season. In 1988/89, South Australia were at the bottom of the ladder, when coach Barry Richards called Lehmann into the team, playing against Western Australia at the WACA. Lehmann remembered little of the match; after being struck in the right temple by a Bruce Reid bouncer, he was knocked unconscious and temporarily ceased breathing. Lehmann made his mark in the following match against New South Wales Blues at Adelaide Oval, reaching 50, but the innings was marred by the manner in which it was ended. Going for a quick single, Lehmann collided with bowler Geoff Lawson and was run out after falling over. However, Richards and South Australian captain David Hookes claimed that Lawson had tripped Lehmann, leading to a confrontation between the two teams. In 1989/90, Lehmann came into contention for national selection, after scoring 228 runs at the age of 19 in a match against New South Wales in that season. He also scored a century against the touring New Zealand cricket team and followed that with centuries in three consecutive Sheffield Shield matches. Having scored over 700 runs in the first half of the season, Lehmann was drafted into the Australian squad for the New Year's Test against Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground after both openers David Boon and Geoff Marsh were injured. As Lehmann was not an opener, Mike Veletta and Tom Moody were selected, and he was relegated to being 12th man. Lehmann was also called into the squad for the triangular ODI series, but after being unused, he was replaced by Mark Waugh. The following year, Lehmann was lured to move to Victoria by John Elliott and Ian Collins, then directors of the Carlton Football Club with a lucrative deal for him to play district cricket for Carlton, as well as the Victorian state team. Lehmann believed that he had a better chance of international selection, feeling that selectors disregarded batting performances at Adelaide Oval on the perception that it was a flat track. Lehmann was not, however, rewarded with international selection, but he did participate in a Shield victory in 1990/91. He was fortunate to play in the final, having needed facial surgery prior to the match after being struck in the nose during a training session. Following another season, Lehmann expressed dissatisfaction, and returned to South Australia.  South Australia and Yorkshire: 1993/94 to 2007/08  From the 1993/94 season until 2007/08, Lehmann played domestic cricket for his home state, South Australia, as well as for Yorkshire in England (from 1997 until 2006). During this time, Lehmann had great success as a player for both teams and he captained them both; South Australia from 1998/99 until 2006/07 and Yorkshire in 2002. Playing for South Australia in this period, Lehmann scored over 10,500 runs in 107 first-class appearances for the state, at an average of around 55. In 1995/96 he was a part of the South Australian team that claimed the Sheffield Shield. He made 37 centuries with a top score of 301 not out against Western Australia at the Adelaide Oval in 2005/06. He also took 44 wickets at an average of 38.06. He held the record for the most first-class runs scored and first-class games played before selection to the Australian Test team prior to Michael Hussey's Test debut in 2005. He currently holds the record for the most runs in the history of the Sheffield Shield/Pura Cup with 12971, over 2000 more than the second highest run scorer, Jamie Cox. Whilst he had great success as a player, his captaincy record was not as distinguished; South Australia did not win any silverware under his captaincy and he quit the role at the end of the 2006/07 season after South Australia managed to win only one Pura Cup game. Lehmann announced his retirement on 19 November 2007 citing injury concerns as the main reason behind his decision to quit. He ended his limited-overs career for South Australia on 21 November with an unbeaten 126 from 104 balls in an unbroken 236 partnership with Matthew Elliott (a South Australian record for any wicket in List A cricket) to complete the highest successful run-chase in Australian List A cricket so far. His final first-class innings for South Australia was a man-of-the-match winning 167 against Western Australia the following weekend. From 1997 until 2006, Lehmann represented Yorkshire as an overseas player. He is by far the most successful overseas player to represent the club since the members first voted to allow overseas players in 1992, having played 88 County Championship games, scoring 8871 runs at an average of 68.76. In 2001 he helped Yorkshire to their first County Championship title since 1968, with 1416 runs in 13 games at an average of 83.29. He scored 26 centuries with a top score of 339 against Durham in 2006 during his final game for the club, helping Yorkshire to avoid relegation by a single point. It is the highest individual first- class innings at Headingley, surpassing Don Bradman's 334 against England in 1930, and the second highest for Yorkshire behind George Hirst's 341 against Leicestershire in 1905. He also holds the record for the highest one-day score for Yorkshire, 191 from 103 balls against Nottinghamshire at Scarborough in 2001. He took 61 wickets at an average of 32.00 in County Championship games. As with South Australia, his captaincy record was not as distinguished as his playing record. He captained Yorkshire only in the 2002 season during which they were relegated to the second division of the County Championship. They did, however, win the Cheltenham and Gloucester Trophy, the 50-over-a-side limited overs competition, under his captaincy. Lehmann was a very popular member of the Yorkshire team amongst both the fans and the club hierarchy. He stated at the time that he would like to return to Yorkshire in a coaching role after his retirement from playing for South Australia. Struggle to make the Australian side Darren Lehmann's Test career performance graph Lehmann had only limited opportunities at the international level. His body shape, relative lack of fitness and physical condition, while never dulling his run- scoring capabilities, meant he was never a favourite of the Australian hierarchy, and notably never saw eye-to-eye with former coach Bob Simpson in the early-mid-1990s. Simpson was regarded as one of the best fielders to have played the game, and was renowned for his heavy emphasis on fielding and fitness, the weakest aspects of Lehmann's game. With Simpson's retirement at the end of the 1996 Cricket World Cup, Lehmann made his ODI debut later in the year in Sharjah after injuries to other players. He was a sporadic member of the team until the 1997/98 Australian season, when captain Mark Taylor was dropped from the team. Lehmann then became a semi-regular member of the ODI team, and also toured India in early 1998. Lehmann made his Test debut in the Third Test against India in March 1998 in Bangalore, after Steve Waugh suffered a hamstring injury. Lehmann scored 52 on debut, as well as claiming Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin while bowling. Selectors were impressed with his performance, and when Waugh returned from injury on the tour of Pakistan later that year, Ricky Ponting was instead dropped. Lehmann scored 98 in the First Test in Rawalpindi, but an injury forced him out of the Second Test in Peshawar in which Taylor scored a (then) Australian record 334 not out on a flat pitch in a high-scoring drawn match. Lehmann failed to perform in the final Test in Karachi and, despite scoring his maiden ODI century, he was dropped for the first two Tests of the 1998/99 Ashes series. Ponting was recalled by the selectors, under the justification of \\"horses for courses\\", as he was regarded as a superior player of pace bowling but weaker in spin, with the first two Tests being held on bouncy wickets in Brisbane and Perth. However, failures by Ponting in the first three Tests saw Lehmann recalled to the team for the final two Tests in Melbourne and Sydney. Further failures by Lehmann in those Tests saw him dropped in early 1999 from the Test team to tour the West Indies, who had a pure pace attack. Lehmann retained his position, however, in the ODI team, and scored another century during the West Indies tour. He went on to the 1999 World Cup, where he played in every match bar one where he was injured, and hit the winning runs in the final. However, upon his return to Australia, he was dropped from the ODI team in favour of Damien Martyn, who was the reserve batsman. Lehmann spent the 1999/2000 international season out of the team, and was not given an opportunity again until the 2000/01 season. During that season Australia was in dominant form, winning all five Tests. Captain Steve Waugh took the opportunity to introduce a rotation system for the ODI series, and Lehmann was allowed regular matches as all members of the team were periodically rested. Despite topping the averages and Steve Waugh having the lowest among the batsmen during the round- robin stages of the triangular tournament, Lehmann was dropped for the finals series, as he was the least senior batsman in the team. Lehmann did not receive further chances in the Test format either, as Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn and Simon Katich were all recalled in 2000 and 2001 when other players were dropped. Following Hayden's heavy scoring in the 2001 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India, he was afforded a place in the ODI squad, and Lehmann was removed altogether from the squad during the 2001/02 season. Australia however faltered during the campaign, and Lehmann was recalled for the final match of the series, in which he top scored. After Australia failed to qualify for the finals, batsmen Mark and Steve Waugh were dropped from the ODI team, and Lehmann's ODI position became permanent. Later in 2002, Mark Waugh was dropped from the Test team, and Lehmann was recalled for the first time in almost four years. After playing three Tests without posting a large score, Lehmann was injured, and Martin Love replaced him. Lehmann came under more pressure upon his return, when during an ODI against Sri Lanka, he had an error of judgment and was run out. Upon returning to the dressing room, he made an offensive racial comment which saw him banned for five ODI matches, becoming the first player banned for racial vilification. After missing the first part of the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Lehmann went on to take the winning catch in the final against India in Johannesburg. Lehmann's Test spot was spared when Martyn was forced out due to a finger injury, with Love and Lehmann playing in the middle order on the subsequent tour of the West Indies. Lehmann then posted his maiden Test century on the tour, and on the winter Test series against Bangladesh in northern Australia, Lehmann scored consecutive centuries to solidify his position in the team. His Test career was again put on hold, when he was injured in November against Zimbabwe, allowing Katich to play in his place and score a century and top score in both innings in the Fourth Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground to stake a claim for Lehmann's spot. However, Steve Waugh retired after the series, and both players were included on the tour to Sri Lanka. There, Lehmann scored consecutive centuries on turning tracks against Muttiah Muralitharan to help Australia to a 3‚Äì0 clean sweep despite conceding a first innings lead in each of the matches. Lehmann's position was again called into question on the 2004 tour to India when Michael Clarke had an opportunity to debut in Bangalore on the 2004 India tour, when Ricky Ponting broke his thumb, and Clarke scored 151 in his first innings in Test matches. When Ponting returned, the Australian selectors were obliged to select Clarke, meaning that they had to drop Lehmann or Katich. Lehmann publicly offered to be dropped following a run of poor form, but the selectors did not take the offer, and the younger Katich was instead dropped. Lehmann stayed on briefly, but after two ungainly dismissals to Pakistani paceman Shoaib Akhtar in the first Two Tests of the 2004/05 series, in which Lehmann was out of position after wandering across the crease, he was dropped in favour of Shane Watson for the Sydney Test. Another maligned shot selection in the following ODI series, attempting to reverse sweep Shahid Afridi first ball, resulted in his dismissal from the ODI team, with Katich again promoted. Lehmann was unable to reclaim a spot as Australia headed towards the 2005 Ashes series looking for batsmen to combat an England team fielding four pace bowlers, including three at the high speed of , and he was never again on the Cricket Australia's contracted players list. In November 2007, he announced his retirement, stating that \\"Physically and mentally I've had enough\\". He published his autobiography, Worth the Wait, in 2004.National Library of Australia catalogue Coaching career Lehmann coaching Australia in 2014 In 2008, Lehmann toured with the Cricket Australia Centre of Excellence as an assistant coach. After the Deccan Chargers disastrous first season, he took charge of them as coach - replacing former India player Robin Singh; Adam Gilchrist was named captain replacing VVS Laxman. Following the below-par performance in the inaugural season, and finishing at the bottom, Deccan then staged an inspired comeback in 2009 by winning the second IPL season. Subsequent to an undefeated run in the initial league stage, the team suffered minor setbacks by losing some close matches. However, the return of Andrew Symonds, Rohit Sharma regaining form, and the continuing exuberance of Captain Adam Gilchrist, bolstered the side. Some luck came the Charger's way towards the end of the league stage, with Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals losing key matches, enabling Deccan to reach the semi-finals. During the semi-finals against the Delhi Daredevils (who were at the top of the table), few gave the Chargers more than an outside chance of winning. Nevertheless, and against the odds, Gilchrist scored a sensational 85 off just 35 balls to put the Daredevils out of the competition, thus giving the Chargers their first IPL final against the Royal Challengers Bangalore. In the final match, Gilchrist was out for a duck in the first over, however the Chargers managed to recover and posted a total of 143 for the loss of 6 wickets; it was felt that a good defending total would have been a further 20 to 30 runs. In the second innings the Chargers came out with all guns blazing right from the first ball, and their spirited effort ensured that they successfully defended the total, winning the game by 6 runs and lifting the prized IPL trophy. On account of emerging as the winners of the 2009 season of the Indian Premier League, the team participated in the inaugural edition of the T20 Champions League, along with two other Indian teams. These were the runners-up of the IPL in 2009 - the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Delhi Daredevils, the toppers of the league-stage points table. The Deccan Chargers were knocked-out in the group stages after losing to the Somerset Sabres and Trinidad & Tobago, who they were drawn against in Group A. After winning the IPL in 2009, there were great expectations of Chargers for 2010. Disappointingly, the team opened with a loss in their inaugural match against KKR, but subsequently won next three matches. Unfortunately, the Chargers then went on to lose their next five matches. This situation caused many to doubt whether the Chargers would be able to make it into next round, but they did so by winning the next five consecutive matches, which qualified them for the play-offs. However the Chargers lost both games in the play-offs (Semi-finals), and were relegated to third place. Before the start of the 2011 Auction of players, the Chargers decided not to retain any of their existing team, putting all of them up for auction. The much anticipated Auction in January not only lived up to expectations, but exceeded them in many ways. The new Deccan team started the 2011 campaign by losing their first two games, but managed to win their next match. Thereafter the team started losing badly, and despite winning some games, were consequentially eliminated from the competition. The team managed to bounce back and showed some pride by winning their final three matches, although these results had no effect on the other teams' chances for qualifying. The Charger's disappointing performance was clearly due to the inexperience of the new squad, and especially to the lack of internationally experienced Indian batsmen. Fans of DC have criticized management for not retaining Rohit Sharma during player the Auction. Deccan finally got to play IPL matches at their home ground after almost three years, but their dismal performances continued at Hyderabad, with but a single win against RCB being the only exception. However, in the away matches, the Chargers did manage to beat Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Pune Warriors, and Kings XI. They ended on a positive note with three consecutive wins, but were unable to rise above seventh position in the league standings. In the 2012 Indian Premier League competition the Deccan Chargers named a new fielding coach Trevor Penney, replacing Mike Young. The Chargers failed to play consistently in 2012, with consecutive defeats - some by narrow margins. Shikhar Dhawan, Dale Steyn, and Cameron White were the only players who managed to help the team put up a fight. The team experienced weakness in the bowling and fielding departments, with fast bowler Ishant Sharma being ruled out due to injury, and spinner Pragyan Ojha traded to the Mumbai Indians. Deccan finished eighth out of the nine teams in the league stage points table, after languishing at the bottom for most of the season. The Deccan Chargers had come into the 2012 season being characterized as 'underdogs', and are yet to lose that name. Lehmann expressed interest in taking up the England coach's job, which was up for grabs after Peter Moores was sacked in first week of January 2009. Lehmann was not the first Australian whose name had been brought-up for discussion of the English job, as Tom Moody was also linked to the position. South Africa's Graham Ford, the Kent director of cricket, had also expressed an interest in filling the post. After having his name connected to the English cricket team, Lehmann was also linked to the New Zealand cricket team, as they were searching for coach as well, to succeed Andy Moles who had resigned in October 2009. Lehmann, Mark Greatbatch, and Jeff Crowe were shortlisted as candidates for the post with New Zealand Cricket, with Lehmann eventually losing-out to Greatbatch. Lehmann was then named coach of the Queensland team after Trevor Barsby's sudden exit in 2010. He took over as coach of the Twenty20 side to prepare for its opening match against Victoria. Under Lehmann's coaching, Queensland won the 2011/12 (110th) season of the Sheffield Shield, the Australian domestic first-class cricket competition; this was only their seventh victory since joining that competition in 1926. They had won six out of their ten Shield matches, lost two, and drew two matches. At the same time as he took up coaching Queensland, he also signed to the Brisbane Heat side, which competed in an expanded eight- team domestic Twenty20 competition. Once again Lehmann‚Äôs old mate in the Australian team Shane Warne suggested to Cricket Australia that Lehmann would be a perfect coach for the young Australian cricket team. Warne also believed his old-school approach would be good for either the vacant head coach role, or a position on the selection panel. Lehmann was appointed the coach of the IPL Kings XI Punjab franchise for 2013, replacing Adam Gilchrist who was coach (and captain) in 2012; he was himself was replaced in 2014 by Sanjay Bangar. As well as previously coaching the now defunct Deccan Chargers franchise, Lehmann had also played for the Rajasthan Royals in the inaugural IPL edition in 2008. In June 2013, Lehmann was appointed as head coach of Australia, replacing Mickey Arthur who had suffered a bad result in the Champions Trophy. His first assignment was the Ashes series in England, which Australia lost 3‚Äì0, however they won the ODI series. On 25 December 2017 Lehmann stated that he wouldn't seek renewal on his contract after the end of 2019. = Resignation as coach after the ball tampering scandal and Brisbane = Lehmann was suspected of involvement in altering the conditions of the ball, along with Cameron Bancroft, skipper Steve Smith, and vice-captain David Warner, on the third day of the third Test against South Africa on 24 March 2018. After an investigation by Cricket Australia, Lehmann was cleared of involvement. However, he later announced that he would resign as head coach of Australia after the fourth and final Test match of the series in Johannesburg. In March 2019, Lehmann was named head coach of Brisbane Heat, a team in the Big Bash League. Playing style Lehmann‚Äôs batting technique was quite unconventional; taking guard outside leg stump, and, just before a ball was bowled, stepping back and across toward and sometimes past off stump. This peculiar technique meant that if the ball was short in pitch, he did not need to step back any further. Lehmann was noted for his play against spin, and was a useful left-arm orthodox spinner himself, as evidenced by his match figures of 6/92 against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2004. He was relatively accurate, but had little ability to turn the ball and used a flat trajectory.  Personal life  Lehmann is married to Andrea White, the sister of his Victorian, and later Yorkshire, teammate and English Test player Craig White. He has two children with his previous wife Emma, one of whom, Jake, has played cricket.

He was the coach for the IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad till 2019. He has been appointed head coach of the Bangladesh Premier League franchise Rangpur Riders for the next three seasons of the tournament from 2017 as well as the head coach of the Multan Sultans in the PSL starting from 2018. In 2017, he applied for the Head coach of Indian Cricket Team. Early life Schooled at Guildford Grammar School in Perth, where his father was headmaster, he exhibited talent for athletics (particularly the high jump) and Australian rules football but excelled at cricket. He was selected to train with the 1st XI side (usually made up of year twelve students) at just thirteen, and play with them the following year. Upon leaving school he moved immediately into Western Australian Grade Cricket with the Midland-Guildford team and in the winter months pursued overseas experience as a young pro in the Northern leagues in England. Playing career \\"Long\\" Tom Moody, so nicknamed for his 1.99 metre (six foot six inch) height, began his first-class career in the 1985/86 season with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and also played in England with Warwickshire and Worcestershire. Captaining WA and Worcester to various trophies, Moody, an aggressive and fast scoring batsman, scored over 20,000 first-class runs and hit 64 centuries; he was also a useful medium pace bowler. His 1,387 List A runs for Worcestershire in 1991 is a record for the county. He played eight Test matches for Australia between 1989 and 1992, although he had more success with Australia's one-day team, appearing in three World Cups and two finals ‚Äì 1987 and 1999 ‚Äì alongside Steve Waugh. He was even more successful when he threw a haggis the distance of 230 feet in 1989. In 1994, he along with Tim Curtis set the record for the highest ever partnership for the 3rd wicket in List A cricket history (309*) Post-retirement Since retirement in 2001, Moody has coached, been an Australian cricketer's representative and for several years held the post of director of cricket with Worcestershire. In May 2005 he was appointed coach of the Sri Lankan national team and he led them to the final of the 2007 world cup before leaving the post. On 14 May 2007, the WACA announced Moody's appointment as manager and head coach of the Western Warriors for the next three years. He coached Kings XI Punjab for the first season of Indian Premier League. Trevor Penney, England's fielding coach during the 2005 Ashes series and assistant to Moody in Sri Lanka, will join as assistant coach. However Moody announced in March 2010 that he would not seek a new contract after the 2009‚Äì2010 season. Under Moody, WA qualified for one final in three seasons, in the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, in his first season which it lost to Victoria. He then began cricket commentary around the world as well as covering some Australian Test and ODI Cricket for Channel Nine and the Big Bash League for Channel Ten. Moody still regularly commentates on both television and radio throughout the Australian international and domestic season. In December 2012, it was announced that Moody would coach the new IPL Sunrisers Hyderabad team.Moody to coach SunRisers Hyderabad Over the course of 2013-2019, Sunrisers Hyderabad have reached the qualifier rounds five times and won the championship in 2016. Moody's long involvement in the game has been recognised over the recent years with appointments to two significant consultancy roles. The first being appointed as the International Director of Cricket for the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) and the second being appointed in 2014 as Director of Cricket with the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League. On 22 September 2017 it was announced that Moody would be appointed as the head coach of the newest team in the Pakistan Super League for the upcoming 2018 season, the Multan Sultans.

Knight was given his middle name in honour of the 1930s English Test bowler Hedley Verity who was killed in World War II and is a distant family relation.Independent newspaper article A left- handed opening batsman and a fine fielder, Knight played in 17 Test Matches and 100 One Day Internationals before announcing his retirement from international cricket after the 2003 World Cup. Biography Born in Watford, Hertfordshire, Knight was educated at Felsted School in Essex and Loughborough University and was an outstanding cricketer from an early age. He won the Daily Telegraph 'Young Cricketer of the Year' award in 1989 and he played cricket for Brentwood cricket club in 1989/91. In domestic cricket, he began his career with Essex in 1991 before transferring to Warwickshire four years later. He was captain of Warwickshire from 2003 to 2005, and led them to victory in the County Championship in the 2004 season. He retired from first- class cricket after the 2006 season and is now a member of the Sky Sports cricket commentary team. He finished his career with 16,172 runs at 44.18 and 40 hundreds. His highest score was an unbeaten 303. International career =Test Cricket= He struggled in the Test arena and made only 1 test century, an innings of 113 vs Pakistan at Headingley in 1996. His next best score was 96 vs Zimbabwe in a drawn game at Bulawayo in 1996‚Äì97. The most obvious reason for this was his technique. Never afraid of genuine fast bowling, his footwork was often not decisive enough which caused him at times to appear to be backing away from short balls and his test innings frequently ended giving a catch to the slips or the wicket-keeper. As a fine fielder and a hard worker, it is surprising that he did not play more for England ‚Äì the England team was not blessed with too many good batsman during Knight's era. However two of the better batsmen were Michael Atherton and Mark Butcher with whom Knight was vying for a place for most of his career. Atherton too was captain of England until 1998 so would have been an automatic choice for opening batsman. =One Day Internationals= Nick Knight commentary at the toss with Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews during England tour in Sri Lanka 2015 Knight was a far more successful, and certainly regular, one-day player for England. In one-day cricket, this backing away in fact helped him score a lot of runs and became something of a hallmark. This same strength/weakness was mirrored in Michael Bevan ‚Äì one of Knight's contemporaries. Debuting in 1996, he scored centuries in his second and third innings in ODI cricket, on consecutive days against a Pakistan bowling attack that included Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. Nick Knight set a world record for the highest ever ODI innings by a batsman when carrying his bat through his innings(125*) when he achieved it v Pakistan in 1996 He was also the first Englishman to carry his bat in an ODI innings. Knight wasn't selected for the World Cup team in 1999 and made his World Cup debut in the 2003 tournament. He performed well in an unsuccessful campaign for England and faced the first delivery in cricket officially to break the 100 mph barrier, bowled by Shoaib Akhtar.Selvey, Mike (2010-07-07). \\"Shaun Tait is certainly very fast, but 100mph?\\".

In limited over international cricket, he played over 50 One Day Internationals for England as a batsman and occasional off-spinner. In county cricket, he played for Surrey, having previously spent 17 years at Worcestershire. In 2007, he became the 24th Worcestershire batsman to pass 10,000 career runs for the county. He also captained Worcestershire from 2005 to 2010, before resigning mid- season.Cricinfo match report In September 2015 he announced his retirement as a player. After obtaining an LLB from the Open University, Vikram then studied the Legal Practice Course at the University of Law. In January 2018, Solanki was appointed deputy head coach at Surrey CCChttps://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/42793322, and in June 2020 he was promoted to head coach by Surrey's Director of Cricket, Alec Stewart, in succession to Michael di Venuto. In addition to Solanki's playing and coaching roles, he has also held cricket administration roles. In March 2009 he was appointed Chairman of The Professional Cricketer's Associationhttps://www.cricketworld.com/vikram-solanki-is-named-as-new-pca- chairman/20040.htm, where he also held the role of Interim Chief Executive and in March 2017 he became FICA Presidenthttps://www.thefica.com/vikram-solanki- appointed-fica-president/ , succeeding former West Indian International, Jimmy Adams.  Early life and domestic career  Solanki was born in Udaipur, Rajasthan, India, but moved to Wolverhampton with his family at the age of eight. Solanki played junior and senior cricket for Wolverhampton cricket club and education from Regis School, Wolverhampton. He made his first-class debut for Worcestershire in 1995, although he had played one-day cricket for the county two seasons earlier. In 1996 he was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award. Although principally taken on by Worcestestershire as a batsman, on his first-class debut, due to there being no fit spinners available, he was selected to bowl his off breaks ‚Äî something he had done with a degree of success the previous winter while on tour with England U19. Although generally an occasional bowler, Solanki produced a ten-wicket haul, five wickets in each innings, against Lancashire at Old Trafford in 1996.Lancashire v Worcestershire, 1996 In 1999 he achieved a batting average of over 40, something he repeated in 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006. 2006 was also the first season since 2000 in which he managed to top 1,000 first-class runs, making 1,252. Together with Worcestershire teammate Kabir Ali, Solanki accepted an offer to play for Rajasthan in the Indian Ranji Trophy during the 2006‚Äì07 season. Solanki joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL) in 2007, he made six appearances for the Mumbai Champs in his single season of ICL. = England A tours = Solanki was picked for two England A tours: to South Africa and Zimbabwe in 1998‚Äì99, and to Bangladesh and New Zealand in 1999‚Äì2000. His fine performances on these latter tours led to his making his full One Day International debut against the South Africans later that same winter. However, he was unable to translate his A-team feats into runs for the senior England side, and after eight innings yielding just 96 runs, he was dropped and not picked again for more than three years.  English county cricket  Solanki was also an occasional bowler of off-spin for Worcestershire, although he has only bowled a handful of overs for England. Worcestershire appointed Solanki as captain of the county for 2005, succeeding the retiring Steve Rhodes. In September 2006 he agreed an extension to his contract which saw him remain at the county until 2009. Following a defeat by Glamorgan on 12 August 2010, he announced his resignation as captain with immediate effect stating that \\"it was time for somebody else to be at the helm\\". After showing good form in the first half of the 2009 season Solanki was called up to the England Lions squad for their fixture against Australia. In July 2012, it was announced that Solanki would leave Worcestershire at the expiry of his contract in September, and join Surrey on a two-year contract. He announced his retirement from the first-class game at the end of the 2015 season, during which he played in only one County Championship match. International career Solanki represented England on 51 occasions in one-day cricket, but has not been selected for a Test Match. His natural talent only rarely came through into his performances for his country, and his England batting average was in the mid-20s. He made two international hundreds, 106 off 108 balls against South Africa at The Oval in 2003 (when he shared an opening partnership of 200 with Marcus Trescothick), and exactly 100 off 93 balls versus Zimbabwe at Bulawayo in 2004/05. Solanki played in four of the five One Day Internationals when England toured Pakistan in December 2005, his best score of 49 also being the highest in England's innings in the final match, which England went on to win by 6 wickets. However, Solanki was not selected for the team to go on the tour to India, instead being chosen to captain the 'A' team in the West Indies. On 1 July 2006, Solanki took his first wicket in ODIs at Headingley, removing Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya for 152. It was something of a hollow triumph, however, as Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga (109) had put on 286, a world record for the first wicket in ODIs, and England were crushed as Sri Lanka scored 324/2 to win by eight wickets in just 37.3 overs. Solanki made history against Australia in 2005 when he became the first supersub in a One Day International, replacing Simon Jones to strengthen England's tail after a batting collapse; coming to the crease at no.8 with England 93/6, Solanki made 53 not out. He also took part in the final two matches of England's time in the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship, replacing the injured Matt Prior. Keeping wicket and opening the batting in both of his matches in that tournament, he took two catches in the first, conceded no byes in either match, and scored 24 and 43. Those were his last international appearances.

Modern Chinese leaders state that they run a \\"socialist democracy\\" in which the Communist Party of China is the central authority that acts in the interest of the people and approves which political parties can run. Many foreign media outlets, however, describe China as totalitarian, authoritarian, soft authoritarian, as a surveillance state, or as a dictatorship. The Democracy Index, produced by the Economist Intelligence Unit, for instance, gives China a 2.26 out of 10 and classifies its government as authoritarian. Zhengxu Wang of Fudan University in Shanghai wrote in a report in 2007: \\"It is clear that public support for democracy is high in China. Public opinion surveys show that more than 90% of Chinese citizens believe that having a democracy is good. But the majority is not yet ready for a major effort towards democratization because they still see economic growth and social stability as more important than freedom of speech, political participation, and other democratic rights.\\" Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping said that a multi-party system would not work for China during a visit to Europe in 2014. He said China had experimented in the past with various political systems, including multi-party democracy, warning that copying foreign political or development models could be catastrophic because of its unique historical and social conditions.  Qing dynasty  The first introduction of the concept of the modern democracy into China is credited to exiled Chinese writer Liang Qichao. In 1895, he participated in protests in Beijing for increased popular participation during the late Qing dynasty, the last ruling dynasty of China. It was the first of its kind in modern Chinese history. After escaping to Japan following the government's clampdown on anti- Qing protesters, Liang Qichao translated and commented on the works of Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, Hume, Bentham and many other western political philosophers. He published his essays in a series of journals that easily found an audience among Chinese intelligentsia hungering for an explanation of why China, once a formidable empire of its own, was now on the verge of being dismembered by foreign powers. In interpreting Western democracy through the prism of his strongly Confucian background, Liang shaped the ideas of democracy that would be used throughout the next century. Liang favored gradual reform to turn China into a constitutional monarchy with democracy. The goal of the Hundred Days' Reform was to reform China into such as system, but it was rapidly reversed in the Wuxu Coup. Liang's great rival among progressive intellectuals was Dr. Sun Yat-sen, a republican revolutionary. Sun felt that democracy would be impossible as long as the Qing monarchy still existed. Democracy was part of his platform, the Three Principles of the People (‰∏âÊ∞ë‰∏ªÁæ©) ‚Äì the principle of the people under 1 nation (nationalism), the principle of the people's rights (democracy), and the principle of the people's livelihood and well-being (civility, decency and respect). Like Liang, Sun agreed that democracy, or at least universal suffrage, could not happen overnight in a country with high illiteracy rates and lack of political consciousness. Sun's Three Stages of Revolution called for a period of \\"political tutelage\\" where people would be educated before elections can occur. Responding to civil failures and discontent, the Qing Imperial Court responded by organizing elections. China's first modern elections were organized by Yuan Shikai for Tianjin's county council in 1907. In 1909, 21 of 22 provinces, with the exception being Xinjiang, held elections for provincial assemblies and municipal councils. Requirements were strict; only those that passed the imperial exams, worked in government or military, or owned 5000 yuan of property may vote or run for office. This essentially limited the electorate to the gentry class. Hundreds of thousands voted and the winners were overwhelmingly constitutional monarchists, followers of Liang Qichao. The provincial assemblies elected half of the 200 member national assembly, the other half was selected by regent Prince Chun. All of these assemblies became hotbeds of dissent against the Qing as they were protected by freedom of speech. In 1909, the Qing government held parliamentary elections.  Republic of China, 1912‚Äìpresent When the 1911 Revolution began, it was the provincial assemblies that provided legitimacy to the rebels by declaring their independence from the Qing Empire. The national assembly also issued an ultimatum to the Qing court. Delegates from the provincial assemblies were sent to Nanjing to publicly legitimize the authority of the provisional government of the Republic of China founded on 1 January 1912. They later also formed the provisional senate. The limited acts passed by this government included the formal abdication of the Qing dynasty and some economic initiatives. In late 1912, national elections were held with an enlarged electorate, albeit still small proportionally to the national population. Sun's Nationalist Party dominated both houses of the National Assembly. Song Jiaoren, the incoming Nationalist prime minister, was assassinated in March 1913 before the assembly's first session. A police investigation implicated sitting prime minister Zhao Bingjun while popular belief was that provisional president Yuan Shikai was behind it. This led to the failed Second Revolution against Yuan. Victorious, Yuan forced the National Assembly to elect him president for a five-year term then purged it of Nationalists. Without a quorum, the assembly was dissolved. After Yuan's death in 1916, the National Assembly reconvened until it was dissolved again the following year by Zhang Xun's coup attempt to restore the Qing. Prime Minister Duan Qirui refused to reconvene the National Assembly, opting instead to hold elections for a new assembly more favorable to him. As a result, a rump of the old assembly moved to Guangzhou to start a rival government in southern China. In northern China, 17 provinces elected a new assembly dominated by Duan's Anfu Club in 1918. This new assembly was dissolved following Duan's defeat in the Zhili‚ÄìAnhui War of 1920. President Xu Shichang organized elections for a third assembly in 1921, but with only 11 provinces voting it never had a quorum and thus never convened. That was the last attempt to hold national elections until 1947. All assemblies were dissolved after the Nationalists' Northern Expedition. The formation of the Nationalist one-party state in 1927 implemented the late Sun's \\"political tutelage\\" program, which forbade elections until the people were considered properly educated. All other parties were kept out of government until 1937, when the impending Second Sino-Japanese War led to the United Front and the formation of the People's Political Council which included the smaller parties. In 1940, partly in response to tensions in the United Front, Mao Zedong offered the new Communist Party doctrine, New Democracy. New Democracy was an intermediary stage unlike western parliamentary, electoral democracy but not yet communism. After the war, the Nationalist's \\"political tutelage\\" ended with the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China. The 1947 National Assembly and 1948 legislative elections were boycotted by the Communists which held most of northern China. As a result, the Nationalists and their junior coalition partners, the Chinese Youth Party and China Democratic Socialist Party, won. =Taiwan, 1945‚Äìpresent= In 1945, after the Surrender of Japan, governance of Taiwan was transferred to the Republic of China. The ceding of Taiwan was formalized under the Treaty of Taipei in 1952. After the governmental exodus from mainland China to the island of Taiwan in 1949, martial law was imposed following the February 28 Incident in 1947. The period of martial law lasted for 38 years and 57 days from 19 May 1949 to 15 July 1987. During this period, The Republic of China was governed as a one-party state under the Kuomintang. On 28 September 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party was founded as an alternate party to the Kuomintang. Since the lifting of martial law in 1987, the ROC has had two major political parties, the Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party. Since then, smaller parties have split from the two main parties and formed as new groups, largely within the Pan-Blue Coalition and Pan-Green Coalition. Until 1996, the President of the Republic of China was elected by the National Assembly. In 1996, the Republic of China electoral code was amended to allow for direct election of the President via plurality voting. The Pan-Blue Coalition consists of the Kuomintang, the People First Party (PFP), New Party (CNP), and Minkuotang (MKT). The Pan-Blue parties traditionally favor Chinese unification, with some moving towards a position supporting the present status quo with eventual unification with China. The Pan-Green Coalition consists of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), Taiwan Independence Party (TAIP), and Taiwan Constitution Association (TCA). The Pan-Green traditionally favor Taiwanese independence.  People's Republic of China, 1949‚Äìpresent  The People's Republic of China was initially based on Mao's concept of \\"New Democracy\\", not the immediate \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\". Soon, however, Mao called for establishing the people's democratic dictatorship. Starting in the 1980s, in the period of Opening and Reform, the government organized village elections in which several candidates would run. However, each candidate was chosen or approved by the Party. Higher levels of government are indirectly elected, with candidates vetted by the government. As a result, the highest levels of government contain either Communist Party members, their United Front allies, or sympathetic independents. Opposition parties are outlawed. China continuously elucidates democracy with \\"Chinese characteristics\\", trying to portray itself as a democratic country, just not a liberal democratic one. The Diplomat says that China's leadership wishes the world to acknowledge that China is run by a legitimate system with the aim of improving the well-being of people. Chinese who supported the Communist Party or held anti-democratic perspectives had long expressed skepticism towards Western style democracy as incompatible with traditionalist Chinese culture. They hold that government is legitimate not when people influence it but when it represents their higher interests. Leaders of the post-Mao reforms in the 1980s argued that the Party's record under Mao was bad, but that the Party reformed without being forced. The American political scientist Andrew Nathan concluded that \\"the reforms aimed to change China from a terror-based, totalitarian dictatorship to a 'mature,' administered dictatorship of the Post-Stalinist Soviet or Eastern European type.\\" \\"Democracy\\" would not involve elections or participation in decision making but \\"the rule of law\\", which was based in procedural regularity in the exercise of power.Andrew J. Nathan. Chinese Democracy. (New York: Knopf : Distributed by Random House, 1985). . pp. 227‚Äì228. In the spring of 1989, student leaders of the Chinese Democracy Movement expressed demands for democracy in terms which deliberately recalled the demands of the May Fourth Movement, which led to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Intellectual leaders such as Liu Xiaobo and Fang Lizhi supported their calls for participation in government and procedures to fight corruption. Prefecture-level members of the National People's Congress are directly elected the general public. Higher level bodies are elected by those from lower level bodies; the provincial legislature is elected by members of the prefecture bodies, and members of the national congress are elected by provincial level bodies. Analysts believe that due to the fact that people are more knowledgeable the leaders they choose at local levels. As policy is more straightforward and potential mistakes cause relatively less damage, local elections are encouraged. In December 2008, more than 350 intellectual and cultural leaders, including Liu Xiaobo, issued Charter 08. The Charter said China remains the only large world power to still retain an authoritarian system that so infringes on human rights, and \\"This situation must change! Political democratic reforms cannot be delayed any longer!\\" After Xi Jinping succeeded General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Amnesty International said that human rights in China have become worse. Human rights abuses are rejected by the government, which insists the country is run according to law. Xi Jinping said that the democracy in China is a whole- process democracy; all major legislative decisions are made only after democratic deliberations and thorough procedures to ensure sound and democratic decision-making. This concept was announced in the State Council's 2007 ‚ÄúWhite Paper on China‚Äôs Political Party System\\", and was consolidated after the 19th Central Committee's fourth plenary session. This type of democracy, where there is political participation including sortition, consultation and deliberation, and elections at lower levels of government, have been called \\"political meritocracy\\" by analysts. This political system aims to select and promote skilled and talented public officials at lower levels of government, instead of a universal electoral democratic method of selecting political leaders at highest levels of government. China's flexible political system allows easy experimentation at local levels. China's constitution does not expiate strict power divisions between the government hierarchy. Socio-economic experiments are first executed in city and provincial levels, adjustments are made then replicated nationwide. For example, the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone tested market economy policies; this was subsequently extended across China. Recent testing has seen initiatives such as recruiting NGOs to provide elderly healthcare and workers rights. The standard barometer specifying economic growth above all has been diminished, with things like environmental sustainability and urban-rural income gap indicies in lieu of GDP growth targets implemented in Hangzhou and Chengdu respectively. The idea of Intra-party democracy has been repeatedly emphasized and expounded by the CPC as an alternative to liberal democratic ideals characterized by multiparty elections and competition. Electoral reform in Hong Kong was seen as an avenue for political liberalization in China; the universal suffrage reform package which would allow Hongkongers to vote for the chief executive but the chief executive first needed to be approved by a comittee. The law failed to pass Hong Kong's legislative council when pan- democrats voted against the package and most of the pro-Beijing members walked out. At the same time, the party has been warning against the harms that \\"Western constitutional democracy\\" could bring to China. = Special Administrative Regions, 1997‚Äìpresent = As European colonies, both were denied democratic governments until very late in the colonial period. Official memos from Communist Party of China leaders, threatening the British government if they were to hold elections in Hong Kong, were repeatedly sent from the 1950s onwards. Hong Kong got its first elections in the 1980s, and Macau in the 1990s. Both Hong Kong and Macau have legislatures; 35 of Hong Kong's 70 legislators are directly elected, as are 14 of Macau's 33. Also, like grassroots elections in China, Hong Kong does hold elections for the district counsel, which act as consultants to the government. Hong Kong The first Chief Executive election saw the Chief Executive elected by a 400-member Selection Committee in 1996, then by 800-member Election Committee in 2002, 2005, 2007 and then 1200-member Election Committee in 2012 and 2017. The Legislative Council of Hong Kong from 1997‚Äì2004 had 60 seats with 24 were directly elected, six elected from an 800-member electoral college known as the Election Committee of Hong Kong, and 30 elected from FCs. Elections in 2004 and 2008, had 30 members were directly elected by universal suffrage from geographical constituencies (GCs) and 30 were elected from functional constituencies (FCs). From 2012 onwards, The Legislative Council consists of 70 elected members, 35 members were directly elected by universal suffrage from geographical constituencies and 35 were elected from functional constituencies. There have been many attempts with many different ideas to introduce universal suffrage since the handover. In 2014, Hong Kong experienced massive protests against the Chinese government's universal suffrage reform package, as the candidates would have to \\"love the country, and love Hong Kong\\" and would \\"protect the broad stability of Hong Kong now and in the future\\" to be able to stand for election. The universal suffrage reform package failed to pass Hong Kong's legislative council when the majority voted against the package. Macau The first Macao Legislative Council in 1996 had 23 members: eight of whom were directly elected (GC), eight indirectly (FC), and seven nominated by the Chief Executive. Its second Legislative Council (2001) had four more members: two more directly elected and two more indirectly. Its third and fourth (2005&2009) legislative councils had 29 members, and the fifth (2013) and sixth (2017) have 33. The first Chief Executive of Macau was elected by the 200-member Chief Executive Selection Committee in 1999, 2004 and 2009 saw the Chief Executive elected by 300-member Election Committee, and 400-member Election Committee in 2014 and 2019.  Popular support  Very few comprehensive surveys have been done to understand the popular support for or against democracy. A 1990 survey from Andrew Nathan and Tianjian Shi reported than 55% of people surveyed agree that \\"China needs more democracy now\\", but 76% agreed that Chinese democracy depends on the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. They also reported that a sizeable proportion feared the negative aspects of democracy, 36% agreed that too many parties would \\"cause political chaos.\\" Surveys done with the World Values Survey and the East Asia Barometer in 2001 and 2002 shows high explicit support for democracy. In the survey, 96% answered either \\"fairly good\\" or \\"very good\\" to the question \\"Do you think having a democratic political system is....\\". Moreover, 81% of respondents agreed do the statement \\"democracy may have problems but it is better than any form government.\\" When asked to compare authoritarianism or democracy, only 5% of respondents said that an authoritarian government can be preferable, with 20% saying it doesn't matter. When chosen to rate out of 10 how suitable democracy is for China, only 2% gave a rating lower than 5, 96% gave a 6 or higher, 76% giving a 8, 9 or 10. Nevertheless, 60 to 70% of respondents feared some democratic practices may cause negative effects. 26% agreed or strongly agreed with the statements \\"in democracy the economic systems runs badly.\\" 35% agreed with that statement \\"democracies are indecisive and have too much quibbling.\\" 18% agreed with the statement \\"democracies aren't good at maintaining order.\\" See also * Chinese views of democracy References  Further reading  Daniel Bell, East Meets West: Human Rights and Democracy in East Asia (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2000). *Daniel Bell, Beyond Liberal Democracy: Political Thinking for an East Asian Context (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2006). *Edmund S.

He was known as one of the foremost exponents of the drive. He was also known by the nickname 'Colonel'. Along with Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath, he was a key player in the Indian batting line up in the late 70s and early 80s. He went on to play till 1992. Dilip has also represented Bombay in the Ranji Trophy. At this pinnacle of best his career, Vengsarkar was rated as the best batsmen in the Coopers and Lybrand rating (a predecessor of the PWC ratings) and he held the number one slot for 21 months in a row till March 2, 1989. Career Vengsarkar made his international cricket debut against New Zealand at Auckland in 1975‚Äì76 as an opening batsman. India won this Test convincingly, but he did not have much success. Later on he usually batted in the No.3 or No.4 position. He played a memorable inning in 1979 against Asif Iqbal's Pakistan team in the 2nd Test at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi. Requiring 390 to win on the final day, he led India's chase getting the team very close to a victory. India ended up with 364 for 6, just 26 runs short of what would have been a remarkable win. With Yashpal Sharma, Kapil Dev and Roger Binny back to the pavilion after the Tea break, Vengsarkar saw himself running out of partners and decided to play the last few overs for a draw. He remained unbeaten on 146. During the 1978‚Äì79 Test Series in India against the West Indies, he was involved in a partnership of over 300 runs with Sunil Gavaskar at Calcutta, with both batsman scoring centuries. He was a member of the 1983 World Champion's team. He had a productive run of scores between 1985 and 1987, where he scored centuries against Pakistan, Australia, England, West Indies and Sri Lanka, many of them in successive games. While the West Indies pacemen dominated the cricket world, Dilip Vengsarkar was one of the few batsmen who was successful against them, and scored 6 centuries against the likes of Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding and Andy Roberts. He is currently team mentor and coach for Telugu Warrior team in the Celebrity Cricket League Season 5 Unique distinction He also scored a century at Lord's in 1986 and thereby attaining the distinction of scoring three consecutive Test match centuries at Lord's. For his effort to help India win the Test series in England (a rare feat in itself) he was awarded the Man of the Series award. He has scored 3 Test centuries at Lord's, which is most by any visiting batsman at the venue in Tests. Captaincy Vengsarkar took over the captaincy from Kapil Dev after the 1987 Cricket World Cup, despite criticism that he missed the semi-final match due to a stomach disorder resulting from seafood allergy. Although he started with two centuries in his first series as captain, his captaincy period was turbulent and he lost the job following a disastrous tour of the West Indies in early 1989 and a stand- off with the Indian cricket board (BCCI).

Though, he was the front runner for the post of the Chairman, Selection Committee, Dilip opted out because of his policy against zonal representation. Dilip Vengsarkar was made the Chairman of the Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) when it was created in 2002 to develop cricket talent within the country. The TRDW program also had the support of Brijesh Patel. Presently he is Chief Adviser of the Cricket Association of Telangana (CAT). In March 2006, BCCI proposed the name of Vengsarkar for match referee, but the proposal did not move forward as Vengsarkar accepted the job as chairman of selectors of the BCCI in September 2006 ‚Äì in contrast to his stance on zonal representation a decade ago. He runs three cricket academies, two in Mumbai and one in Pune. These academies give cricket training free of cost to the selected players selected on their skill level. He has recently launched his own website whose aim is to help upcoming players of India to move a step ahead.

It consists of four strings, stretched over a gourd, which serves as a resonator. The strings each have a different thickness. The thickness of it determines how low the sound will be. For example, a string that is really thick has a low sound and a really thin string as a high- pitched sound. In addition, the instrument also has a tin rattle attached to its body, which the musician plays by striking the strings and gourd simultaneously, adding an element of percussion to the music. In this way, it is similar to the sinding. The bolombatto was originally played by shepherds, who used the combined sounds of the strings and percussion to frighten away wild animals.

She was the first woman to be awarded a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Cambridge, in 1926. Early life Blodgett was born on January 10, 1898 in Schenectady, New York. She was the second child of Katharine Buchanan (Burr) and George Reddington Blodgett. Her father was a patent attorney at General Electric where he headed that department. He was shot and killed in his home by a burglar just before she was born. GE offered a $5,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of the killer, but the suspected killer hanged himself in his jail cell in Salem, New York. Her mother was financially secure after her husband's death, and she moved to New York City with Katharine and her son George Jr. shortly after Katharine's birth. In 1901, Katherine's mother moved the family to France so that the children would be bilingual. They lived there for several years, returned to New York for a year, during which time Katherine attended school in Saranac Lake, then spent time traveling through Germany. In 1912, Blodgett returned to New York City with her family and attended New York City's Rayson School. Education Blodgett's early childhood was split between New York and Europe, and she wasn't enrolled in school until she was eight years old. After attending Rayson School in New York City, she entered Bryn Mawr College on a scholarship, where she was inspired by two professors in particular: mathematician Charlotte Angas Scott and physicist James Barnes. In 1917, Irving Langmuir, a former colleague of her father and future Nobel Prize laureate, took Katherine on a tour of General Electric (GE)'s research laboratories. He offered her a research position at GE if she first completed higher education, so she enrolled in a master's degree program at the University of Chicago after receiving her bachelor's degree. At the University of Chicago she studied gas adsorption with Harvey B. Lemon, researching the chemical structure of gas masks. She graduated in 1918 and took a research scientist position working with Langmuir. After six years at the company, Blodgett decided to pursue a doctoral degree with hopes of advancing further within GE. Langmuir arranged for her to study physics at Cambridge University, at the Cavendish Laboratory persuading somewhat reluctant administrators to offer one of their few positions to a woman. She was enrolled at Newnham College, matriculating in 1924.Newnham College student records, accessed January 10, 2019 She studied with Sir Ernest Rutherford and in 1926 became the first woman to receive a PhD in physics from Cambridge University. Work at General Electric Blodgett was hired by General Electric as a research scientist in 1918 after receiving a master's degree from the University of Chicago. She was the first woman to work as a scientist for General Electric Laboratory in Schenectady, NY. She often worked with Irving Langmuir, who had pioneered a technique for creating single-molecule thin films on the surface of water. Blodgett and Langmuir explored the application of similar techniques to lipids, polymers, and proteins, creating monomolecular coatings designed to cover surfaces of water, metal, or glass. These special coatings were oily and could be deposited in layers only a few nanometers thick. In 1935, Blodgett extended Langmuir's work by devising a method to spread monomolecular coatings one at a time onto glass or metal. By repeatedly dipping a metal plate into water covered by a layer of oil, she was able to stack oil layers onto the plate with molecular precision. The apparatus which she used and refined is known as the Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett trough. Using this technique, Blodgett developed practical uses for Langmuir's gossamer films. Blodgett used a barium stearate film to cover glass with 44 monomolecular layers, making the glass more than 99% transmissive and creating \\"invisible\\" glass. The visible light reflected by the layers of film canceled the reflections created by the glass. This type of nonreflective coating is now called Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett film and is widely used. The first major cinematic production to use Blodgett's invisible glass was the popular film Gone with the Wind (1939), noted for its crystal- clear cinematography. Once introduced, nonreflective lenses were used for projectors and cameras by the post-war movie industry. Blodgett's glass was also used for submarine periscopes and airplane spy cameras during World War II. Blodgett also invented the color gauge, a method to measure the molecular coatings on the glass to one millionth of an inch. The gauge employs the concept that different thicknesses of coatings are different colors. While examining the layering of stearic acid on a glass plate, she realized that the addition of each layer, about 2/10,000,000 inch thick, reliably changed the color of the plate. Before her invention, the best measurement instruments were only accurate to a few thousandths of an inch. Her glass \\"ruler\\" much more precisely showed the progression of colors and their corresponding thicknesses. Measuring thickness became as simple as matching colors. Blodgett and Langmuir also worked on improvements to the light bulb. Their studies on electrical discharges in gases helped lay the foundations for plasma physics. Blodgett was issued eight U.S. patents during her career. She was the sole inventor on all but two of the patents, working with Vincent J. Schaefer as co-inventor. Blodgett published over 30 technical papers in various scientific journals and was the inventor of poison gas adsorbents, methods for deicing aircraft wings, and improving smokescreens. Personal life Blodgett never married and lived a vibrant life, living in a Boston marriage for many years with Gertrude Brown, who came from an old Schenectady family. For another period she also lived with Elsie Errington, the English-born director of a nearby girls' school. \\"The household arrangement freed Blodgett from most domestic responsibilities‚Äîexcept for making her famous applesauce and popovers.\\" Unfortunately, she did not leave any personal papers with her thoughts about her long-term relationships with these women. Blodgett's niece and namesake was astrophysicist and civil servant Katharine Blodgett Gebbie. In an autobiographical memoir, Gebbie recalled that on family visits her Aunt Blodgett: :\\"always arrived with suitcases full of 'apparatus', with which she showed us such wonders as how to make colors by dipping glass rods into thin films of oil floating on water.\\" Gebbie often spoke in later life of her aunt's influence by personal example on her choice of a career in science. Blodgett bought a home in Schenectady overlooking her birthplace where she spent most of her adult life. She was an actress in her town's theater group and volunteered for civic and charitable organizations. Blodgett was the treasurer of the Traveler's Aid Society there. She spent summers at a camp at Lake George in upstate New York, to pursue her love of gardening. Blodgett was also an avid amateur astronomer; she collected antiques, played bridge with friends and wrote funny poems in her spare time. She died in her home on October 12, 1979. Awards Blodgett received numerous awards during her lifetime. She received a star in the seventh edition of American Men of Science (1943), recognizing her as one of the 1,000 most distinguished scientists in the United States. In 1945, the American Association of University Women honored her with its Annual Achievement Award. In 1951 she received the prestigious Francis Garvan Medal from the American Chemical Society for her work on monomolecular films. That same year, she was chosen by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as one of 15 \\"women of achievement.‚Äù Also in 1951, she was honored in Boston's First Assembly of American Women in Achievement (the only scientist in the group) and the mayor of Schenectady honored her with Katharine Blodgett Day on June 13, 1951 because of all the honor she had brought to her community. In 1972, the Photographic Society of America presented her with its Annual Achievement Award and in 2007 she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 2008 an elementary school in Schenectady was opened bearing her name. She received honorary doctorates from Elmira College (1939), Western College (1942), Brown University (1942), and Russell Sage College (1944).

Skinner Butte is a local landmark and the location of Skinner Butte Park, a municipal park. It is named after Eugene Skinner, the founder of Eugene. During the latter 20th century, it was the location of a cross which was removed in 1997. Description The view of downtown Eugene from the top of Skinner Butte The elevation at the top of Skinner Butte is 682 feet (208 m), approximately 200 feet (60 m) above the surrounding city. A winding road leads to the summit, which provides a comprehensive view of the city. The public park features hiking trails, as well as open lawns. The butte is also the location of a giant \\"O\\" emblem (representing the University of Oregon) visible from the air and the city. Less visible is the \\"Big E\\" symbolizing the former Eugene High School (now South Eugene High School). These emblems were erected in the early 20th century. The \\"O\\" used to be lit leading up to the Civil War game. On September 23, 2010, the Big \\"O\\" was added to the National Register of Historic Places. A small reservoir sits on public land on the east flank of the butte below the summit. History Shelton- McMurphey House The butte was known as \\"Ya-Po-Ah\\" in the language of the Kalapuya, who inhabited the Willamette Valley prior to the arrival of Euro- American settlers in the 19th century. In 1846, Eugene Skinner, an American settler who had arrived in the valley after traveling overland to California, erected a cabin on the butte on the advice of the Kalupuya, who warned him about floods on the Willamette. Skinner's cabin became the basis for his Donation Land Claim. The site of the cabin is commemorated today by a marker on the hillside. A replica of the cabin has been located in various places in the park over the years. Skinner Butte Park was dedicated in 1914. According to the Register-Guard, \\"at one point, the park...included a car camp, a zoo and, during the Depression, a Civilian Conservation Corps regional camp.\\" The park is a popular site for rockclimbing (on \\"The Columns\\" the site of a former basalt quarry on the west side of the butte that operated from the 1890s through the 1930s) and birding, among other recreational activities. In July 2006, the City of Eugene opened a new playground, RiverPlay Discovery Village Playground, in the park. The butte is also the site of the Shelton-McMurphey- Johnson House, a Queen Anne Victorian residence built in 1880 by a family that once owned the entire butte. Before trees grew up and obscured it, the house was known as the \\"Castle on the Hill\\". It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.Shelton-McMurphey-Johnson House The name \\"Ya-Po-Ah\\" lives on in \\"Ya-Po-Ah Terrace\\", a controversial high-rise retirement home built at the foot of the butte in 1968.Style & Vernacular: A Guide to the Architecture of Lane County, Oregon. Western Imprints, The Press of the Oregon Historical Society: 1983. = Cross controversy= A sign shows the location of where lit crosses used to be on Skinner Butte between 1936 and 1964 The Skinner Butte Cross at New Hope Christian College (formerly Eugene Bible College) From the opinion of the 9th Federal Circuit Court, the official history of this controversy is as follows: :The City of Eugene (\\"City\\") maintains a public park on and around Skinner's Butte [sic], a hill cresting immediately north of the City's downtown business district. The land was donated to the City and has been maintained as a public park for many years. From the late 1930s to 1964, private individuals erected a succession of wooden crosses in the park, one replacing another as they deteriorated. In 1964, private individuals erected the cross at issue in this litigation. It is a fifty-one foot concrete Latin cross with neon inset tubing, and it is located at the crest of Skinner's Butte [sic]. The parties who erected the cross did not seek the City's permission to do so beforehand; however, they subsequently applied for and received from the City a building permit and an electrical permit. :Since 1970, the City has illuminated the cross for seven days during the Christmas season, five days during the Thanksgiving season, and on Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Veteran's Day. :The cross has been the subject of litigation since the time it was erected. In 1969, the Oregon Supreme Court held that the cross violated both the federal and the Oregon Constitutions because it was erected with a religious purpose and created the inference of official endorsement of Christianity. Lowe v. City of Eugene, 463 P.2d 360, 362-63 (Or. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1042, rehearing denied, 398 U.S. 944 (1970). Soon after, the City held a charter amendment election, and on May 26, 1970, the voters, by a wide margin, approved an amendment to the City Charter designating the cross a war memorial. Pursuant to that amendment, the cross was deeded to the City as a gift, and a bronze plaque was placed at the foot of the cross dedicating it as a memorial to war veterans. The Eugene City Charter provides that the \\"concrete cross on the south slope of the butte shall remain at that location and in that form as property of the city and is hereby dedicated as a memorial to the veterans of all wars in which the United States has participated.\\" On June 14, 1997 and as a result of the 9th Federal Circuit's ruling, the cross was subsequently removed and reinstalled at Eugene Bible College near Churchill High School and a flagpole flying an American flag was erected in its place. U.S. Representative from Oregon Charles O. Porter was one of the people who had advocated for the removal of the cross.

History  Union Building from Kensington Gore The establishment of a students' union was recognised with the construction of the north building of Beit Quad in 1910-11 designed by Sir Aston Webb. The original idea for the building came from Sir Arthur Acland, a member of the governing body, who saw the need for a place for students to congregate and develop a collegiate social life. = Timeline = * 1907 Formation of Imperial College of Science and Technology incorporating the Royal School of Mines, the Royal College of Science and City and Guilds College * 1907 Imperial College Union formed as a federation of the 3 College Unions * 1911 The Union building in South Kensington is constructed * 1922 Founder member of NUS (leaves for the first time in 1923) * 1949 Felix (newspaper) is founded * 1969 First directly elected sabbatical President See Felix issues of and * 1984 The Union starts catering operation * 1985 The Union Starts running own bars * 1987 First professional welfare advisor at the Union * 1988 Imperial College School of Medicine is established at St. Mary‚Äôs * 1996 Union Council is made the supreme governing body * 1997 Union stops running bookshop on campus. * 1997 First medical student to be elected President (Andrew Heeps) * 1998 First Deputy President (Education & Welfare) Sabbatical * 1998 Imperial College School of Medicine merges with Charing Cross and Royal Postgraduate Medical schools * 2000 Merger with Wye College and Kennedy Institute * 2001 Sir Richard Sykes appointed Rector of Imperial College * 2003 College adopts Faculty structure in place of constituent Colleges. * 2004 College rebrands as \\"Imperial College, London\\" * 2005 Union Building Redevelopment - Project starts * 2005 First Deputy President(Graduate Students) at the Union. * 2006 Union Building Redevelopment - Construction work starts * 2007 Imperial College Centenary * 2007 The Union rejoins the NUS (again) * 2007 Imperial College leaves the University of London * 2008 The Union leaves the NUS * 2009 First Deputy President (Education) and Deputy President (Welfare) = Relationship with the NUS = Imperial College Union is most noted for the history of its relationship with the National Union of Students (NUS). Despite being involved in the founding of the NUS in 1922, Imperial College Union withdrew its membership of the NUS a year later. Since then, Imperial College Union spent long periods outside the NUS, interspersed with brief periods of membership. A referendum for NUS affiliation held in 2002 was overwhelmingly rejected by members of the Imperial College Union with 72% in favour of remaining out of the NUS. In November 2006, after 30 years of not being part of the NUS, a petition proposed a debate to affiliate with NUS at Freshers' Fair 2006 collected 617 valid signatures, from just above the 5% minimum of Imperial College Union members necessary to call a referendum. A referendum was held between 14 and 16 November 2006, which resulted in NUS affiliation with 53.26% for to 46.74% against and a turn-out of over 30%. After the failure of governance reform measures supported by Imperial College Union at the NUS conference in 2008, the union council voted in favour of holding a referendum on disaffiliation from the NUS. The resulting referendum showed that the Members of Imperial College Union decided that their Union should no longer affiliate to the National Union of Students.  Organisation  The Union is controlled by a variety of democratically elected representatives who sit on Union committees, control Union resources and represent the views of students to the College and external bodies. The Union is led by officers who act as representatives to the 14,900 Union members. The most senior officers are the five sabbatical officers who work full-time for the Union on a variety of areas ranging from commercial services to campaigns and representation. These officers are supported by 35 full-time and up to 250 part-time staff, and the 2,600 elected officers of the Union's 320+ clubs and societies. In 2013, the Union successfully registered as a charity. =Constituent Union Structure= There are six constituent unions which run as constituent parts of the Union. These are largely historical in origin and retain many traditions, such as their names when most of the actual faculties now have different names. Some represent the students in their respective faculties: the City and Guilds College Union (for engineers), the Royal College of Science Union (for scientists) and the Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union (for medical students). They are all run by part-time officers elected from the student body, with the exception of the Medical Union President, who is an elected full-time sabbatical officer with a one-year tenure. In 2002 the Royal School of Mines Union was absorbed into the City and Guilds College Union and became a clubs & societies committee. However, in 2012 after running autonomously from City and Guilds Union for many years, The Royal School of Mines regained its constituent union status, solely looking after the social aspects of its students. In the same governance review of 2012, Silwood Park Students' Union and the Graduate Students' Association (representing all postgraduate students) also became a constituent union. The Silwood Park Union operates largely independently from the overall Union but has no part or full-time sabbatical leadership.  Clubs, volunteering projects and societies  Imperial College Union has a large number of student-led clubs, volunteering projects and societies (known as CSPs), with over 400 in total. Funding for CSPs at Imperial College Union is significant, taking up a sizeable portion of the Union's annual subvention provided by Imperial College London, though many clubs supplement this with sponsorship from outside of the Union. CSPs at Imperial College Union are administered by the Clubs, Societies' and Project Board, who deal with the majority of procedural issues and who are responsible for representing the clubs within their care to Imperial College Union. Clubs are then grouped and fall under smaller organisational boards (e.g. the Athletics Clubs Committee handles the sports clubs). Examples of notable student groups are Project Nepal which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development in rural NepalFelix Online Archive, November 30 2011 Article on new Project Nepal group at Imperial College and partnership with InterVol. Retrieved 16 January 2012. and the El Salvador Project, a construction based project in Central America.El Salvador Project Sponsors Page El Salvador Project lists Imperial College Union as an official sponsor. Retrieved 16 January 2012. Other societies include sports-related societies, such as Imperial College Boat Club and Imperial College Gliding Club; music societies such as Imperial College A Capella, under which The Techtonics won the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2016; social societies such as the Imperial College Debating Society. Each department also has its own departmental society. CSPs are supported by a number of features, including 15 minibuses which are available for clubs to hire. Imperial College also owns a mountain hut in Snowdonia, Wales, which it lets clubs use free of charge. Facilities =Bars= Beit Quad. The Union Bar, 568, and Metric are on the ground floor The main Union bars are located on the north side of the Beit Quadrangle. There are three: *FiveSixEight is a bar serving food, with large screens often showing sports events or popular music channels. *The Union Bar is a small wood-panelled bar, and has existed in its current form since 1956. The bar has a large selection of real ale and claims to boast the largest collection of pewter tankards in Europe, with many dating back to the early 20th century. Each tankard represents an officer of one of the clubs and only the current or former club officers are allowed to use their club's tankards. *Metric is a nightclub which opened in November 2010. During term time, Metric often plays host to DJs or to live bands performing to the backdrop of an electronic lighting wall. During the summer Metric hosts some of the Proms Extra events (part of The Proms). FiveSightEight and The Union Bar are both Cask Marque Accredited. The Union also runs the Reynolds Bar situated in Charing Cross Hospital, largely frequented by the students of Imperial College School of Medicine. The bar was originally run by CXWSU for the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School. The Silwood Park campus bar is operated by an external company, although students have pushed for a Union-run bar in recent years. The bar boasts Guinness and Stella Artois Cidre on tap and also has a small selection of bottled ales and ciders. Three flavors of crisps are available to feed hungry patrons. The bar television almost exclusively shows Big Bang Theory, and there is a small stereo in the main room which students can hook up to their own musical collections if desired. =Theatre= Imperial College Union has a theatre located in the Union Concert Hall (UCH) which is found on the second floor of the Main Union Building, Beit Quad. The majority of performances are put on by the student societies of Imperial College, ranging from serious drama through to Gilbert & Sullivan Marathons. The space is shared with the Imperial College Dramatic Society and Imperial Cinema and other student societies as a multipurpose space. The theatre has a fly tower with a selection of lighting and fly bars, the venue has lectriflex, DMX and sound & comms multicore installed throughout. In the Summer of 2014 the Union Concert Hall underwent an extensive redevelopment after a grant was awarded to do so. In early 2015, the Dramatic Society installed a considerable amount of brand new cabling which will make the venue even more useful to anyone who wishes to use it. =Cinema= Imperial College Union has a student run Cinema located in the Union Concert Hall, in Beit Hall. The Cinema is considered a club under the Arts & Entertainments Board, however provides a service to members and non-members. The cinema is a professionally equipped cinema with a 33 ft screen, Dolby Digital surround sound system, Kinoton (35mm) and Barco (Digital) projectors and seats up to 200. Pre-show advertisements are provided by Pearl & Dean. =Redevelopment of the Union Building= As of August 2006 ¬£2.2 million had been raised out of the total ¬£6 million required for the redevelopment of the Union wing of Beit Hall. All three phases of the building project were completed by 2011, including the full bar and nightclub refurbishment and moving the Union Gym to level 3 of the building. Former ICU Presidents and Sabbatical Officers Notable former sabbaticals include: * Piers Corbyn, President 1969-70. * Trevor Phillips, President 1975-77. * Christopher Fox, Baron Fox, President 1980. * Pallab Ghosh, Felix Editor 1983-84.

It begins identically to Metamorphosis II, with the word metamorphose (the Dutch form of the word metamorphosis) forming a grid pattern and then becoming a black-and-white checkered pattern. Then the first set of new imagery begins. The angles of the checkered pattern change to elongated diamond shapes. These then become an image of flowers with bees. This image then returns to the diamond pattern and back into the checkered pattern. It then resumes with the Metamorphosis II imagery until the bird pattern. The birds then become sailing boats. From the sailing boats the image changes to a second fish pattern. Then from the fish to horses. The horses then become a second bird pattern. The second bird pattern then becomes black-and-white triangles, which then become envelopes with wings.

Snakes depicts a disc made up of interlocking circles that grow progressively smaller towards the center and towards the edge. There are three snakes laced through the edge of the disc. The image is printed in three colours: green, brown and black. The use of snakes and the color palette of this composition recalls an earlier woodcut by the artist, M√∂bius Strip I (1960). The print has rotational symmetry of order 3, comprising a single wedge-shaped image repeated three times in a circle. This means that it was printed from three blocks that were rotated on a pin to make three impressions each. Close inspection reveals the central mark left by the pin. In several earlier works Escher explored the limits of infinitesimal size and infinite number, for example the Circle Limit series, by actually carrying through the rendering of smaller and smaller figures to the smallest possible sizes. By contrast, in Snakes, the infinite diminution of size ‚Äì and infinite increase in number ‚Äì is only suggested in the finished work.

Since retiring he has been a lawn bowls competitor. He was a left-handed opening batsman. He played first-class cricket for Orange Free State, Western Province, Northern Transvaal, Eastern Province and Griqualand West in South Africa, for Queensland in Australia and Sussex in England. In 2008, he coached the Indian Premier League franchise Chennai Super Kings and later returned to coaching in South Africa.  Early years  Wessels was six years old when he was introduced to the game of cricket. Volsteedt taught him the basics of the game and began to regularly play cricket with him during Sunday visits to the Wessels household. A few years later, Volsteedt became the master in charge of cricket at Grey College, Bloemfontein, and coached Wessels during his playing days for the school's first team. From a very early age, Wessels showed exceptional sporting talent. By the age of 12, he was playing rugby union for the Free State primary schools team and he was one of the leading schoolboy swimmers in the province. However, after a close encounter with death, due to nephritis, Kepler's father decided that his son would no longer be allowed to participate in swimming. Wessels decided to switch to cricket, even though the rules of Grey College did not allow him to play at such a young age. With the help of Johan Volsteedt (who was the first team captain), Wessels was allowed to participate in the net practices and soon cricket became his main activity during summer. During winter, he played tennis, at which he won so frequently that, by 1973, he was the number 1 under-16 player in South Africa and was offered a scholarship of $25 000 over four years from the University of Houston. However, due to the fact that he played as an under-16 against adults, Wessels began to lose regularly in senior tournaments. After a dramatic loss during the Griqualand West Open in Kimberley ‚Äì after which he cut all the strings from his racket in the changing room ‚Äì Wessels turned down the offer from Houston and decided to focus all his attention on cricket. As a young cricket player, Wessels scored his first century at the age of nine and was taken into the Free State under-13 side during the same year, getting scores of 80, 80, 88 and 121 against players four years his senior. By the end of 1969, his batting average for Grey College (after nine innings) was 259.59. He was selected to represent the Free State schools side at the prestigious Nuffield Week for five consecutive seasons; and was selected three times for the South African schools side, the third season as captain. Wessels finished his high school cricket career with an innings of 130 not out, during a home game for Grey College, against rival Queen's College from the Eastern Cape. His superb innings laid the foundation for Grey's first victory over Queen's in 18 years. He played his first first-class match at the age of 16, batting at number nine and making 32 for Orange Free State in a team captained by the Test veteran Colin Bland. At 18 he was playing professionally in England, opening the batting for Sussex.  World Series Cricket  In the late 1970s, Wessels was drafted by Kerry Packer to play for the Australian World Series Cricket Team. As a South African with little hope of playing Test cricket for his country, Wessels joined the \\"circus\\" to take advantage of the better pay and conditions that the WSC offered. He arrived in Sydney at the age of 21 and was put on trial at the local Waverley club, for Packer to see first if Wessels was decent material for World Series Cricket. After scoring 123 against Penrith, newspapers started speculating about a place for Wessels in the New South Wales state side. The media was unaware that Wessels had already signed for Packer. An innings of 137 followed against the Sydney club side and the selectors immediately named him in the state training squad. That was the signal Packer needed and he quickly called a press conference to announce that Wessels would be playing World Series Cricket instead. Packer saw in Wessels a reliable opening batsman ‚Äì something that the Australian WSC side was in serious need of. To help him find his feet in the new environment, Wessels played a couple of games for the second-string Cavaliers side. During his first game, two short balls had struck him in the ribs and on the chest, and in both cases, he refused to leave the field and battled on to score a 54 from the innings. Finally, Wessels was included in the Australian XI, for a one-day game against the WSC World XI, which included four fellow South Africans. He scored 20, made 21 in the next game and then got 92 against the Cavaliers side. A Supertest against a 'Rest of the World' side followed in Melbourne, but Wessels scored only eight in the first innings. In the second innings, he managed to get to 46. He regained some respect, however, during the next Supertest against the WSC West Indies, by scoring 126 in his first innings. During the Supertest final between Australia and the World XI, Wessels scored 27 in his first innings, but experienced a miserable second one. Australia lost by five wickets. The one-day series involved a best-of-five final between Australia and the West Indies and Wessels scored an unbeaten 136 during the first match which was the only century in the WSC International Cup, during one of the finest one-day innings of his career. He scored 40 and 70 from the next two games respectively, after which the West Indies led the series 2‚Äì1. They won the series during the fourth match, thanks to a better run-rate, when Australia couldn't finish bowling their 50 overs by the scheduled end of the match at 10:30 p.m. A third leg to the World Series was due to be played in the West Indies, but Wessels was forced to stay behind, because he still held a South African passport and would not be granted visas for the Caribbean. It was the end of his World Series Cricket experience, as Packer reached a settlement with the Australian Cricket Board in 1979. The World Series was disbanded after that.  Australian international career  = 1982/83 England tour of Australia ‚Äì debut = Wessels stayed in Australia to qualify for the Australian Test side, playing for Queensland, and made his debut against England at The Gabba in Brisbane on 26 November 1982. He became the first South-African born person to play for Australia, and the 13th Australian player to score a century on debut. Wessels dominated the English bowling, with scores of 162 in the first innings and 46 in the second. He was instrumental in Australia's victory by seven wickets and was given the \\"Man of the Match\\" award. He eventually played four Tests in his debut series and scored 386 runs at an average of 48.25. = 1982/83 Australian tour of Sri Lanka = In April 1983, Australia played their inaugural Test match against Sri Lanka. Wessels continued his good form with 141, thus becoming the first overseas player to score a century in Sri Lanka. He was named \\"man of the match\\" in Australia's innings victory. = 1983 World Cup = Wessels also played in the 1983 World Cup. He made 76 against Zimbabwe but it was not enough to save Australia from defeat. After failing against West Indies and India, he was dropped from the side. = 1983/84 Pakistan tour of Australia = Wessels played in each of the five Tests against Pakistan, scoring 256 runs at an average of 42.66. This included 179 in the third Test, which remained his top score. Despite this moderately good form, Wessels was outscored by five other Australian players who took advantage of the poor quality Pakistan bowling. Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh all retired from Australian cricket at the end of the series, and much was expected of Wessels (and others) to score consistently in the upcoming series against the West Indies. = 1983/84 Australian tour of West Indies = Any hope that Wessels and other new Australian batsmen would cope against the West Indian fast bowling was dashed. Wessels scored 4 and 20 in the first Test and 4 and 4 in the second Test, before injury ruled him out of the rest of the series. He was dismissed by West Indian fast bowler Joel Garner three times, and was nicknamed \\"Joel's bunny\\" as a result. For the first time in his Test career, Wessels' form had deserted him and he was not a certainty for selection when the West Indians toured Australia in 1984/85. However he won man of the series during a five-match one day tour of India in September and October 1984. = 1984/85 West Indian tour of Australia = As a Test player, Wessels' most successful period came during the disastrous West Indian tour of Australia. After scoring only 13 and 0 in the first Test, Wessels was in danger of being dropped from the Australian side. However, due to the poor performance of almost all of Australia's batting in that match, he was retained for the second Test. He responded by going out for 0 after the second ball, and many people thought that his career was over. In the second innings, however, he top scored with 61, giving the selectors no option but to include him for the third Test. Batting up number 3, Wessels top scored again with 98 runs in the first innings and 70 in the second, in a match where the Australian batting was being taken apart by the West Indian bowlers. The fourth Test saw Wessels continue his heavy scoring, with 90 and 0 helping Australia force a draw. It was in the fifth Test, however, which saw him totally dominate the West Indian bowlers with 173. His batting helped Australia to 9 (declared) for 471, which was a winning total on a wicket that was taking spin. Wessels scored 505 runs at an average of 56.11 against the West Indies, which was more than double the number of runs scored by any other Australian batsmen during that series. Given the dominance of West Indian bowling at the time, and the fragility of the Australian batting line-up, Wessels' performance during that series was world class. = 1985 Australian tour of England = Unfortunately, Wessels was unable to maintain his form during the 1985 Ashes Tour of England. Although he scored three fifties (top score 83), Wessels ended the series with 368 runs at an average of 33.45. While this was not a failure, it was certainly below his best. Australia lost the series and suffered two very heavy innings defeats as, Allan Border aside, the batting lineup become increasingly fragile. It is likely that the impending rebel tour to South Africa affected Wessels' concentration during the 1985 Ashes tour. Because of his South African background, Wessels was seen by many players and officials as one of the major contacts for the Rebel Tour amongst the Australian players. Wessels has steadfastly denied this accusation. = 1985/86 New Zealand tour of Australia ‚Äì Retirement = Wessels' final match for Australia was the first Test against New Zealand in Brisbane, 8‚Äì12 November 1985. Wessels was alone in resisting the devastating bowling of Richard Hadlee, scoring 70 out of Australia's first innings total of 179. He scored only 3 in the second innings, with Australia suffering its heaviest defeat against New Zealand. Soon after the match was finished, Wessels announced his retirement, expressing his disillusionment with Australian cricket. He did not realize that 6 years later he would be playing Test Cricket again, this time for his home nation.  Between test careers  Cricket was still Wessels' profession, and he played a full season (1985/86) of Sheffield Shield Cricket for Queensland where he scored 957 runs at an average of 50.37. He also captained the side in Border's absence, and was unlucky not to captain the first Queensland side to win the Sheffield Shield. The final, between NSW and Queensland, was held in Sydney on 14‚Äì18 March 1986. Despite Wessels scoring 166 and 29 in his last match for Queensland, and despite a dominating all-round performance from his team, the match ended in a draw, which allowed NSW to win the Sheffield Shield. Wessels' last act for Queensland was a creditable individual bowling performance of 16‚Äì5‚Äì26‚Äì2, including the wicket of a young Mark Waugh. After the season finished, Wessels re-settled in South Africa again and began playing, this time for Eastern Province. Before moving to Australia, Wessels had played for Orange Free State, Western Province and Northern Transvaal. He remained playing for Eastern Province from 1986 until his retirement in 2000. His debut with Eastern Province was auspicious, captaining the side to a 212-run victory over Orange Free State, and personal scores of 133 and 78 against a bowling attack that included a young Allan Donald. Wessels was also included in the 1986-7 Australian rebel tour to South Africa, where he played for Australia. The series of four \\"Tests\\" ended in a 1‚Äì0 victory to the South African team, but Wessels scored 327 runs at 54.50, including two centuries in the fourth match. Wessels played with many former Australian teammates in this series, including Kim Hughes, John Dyson, Steve Smith, Rodney Hogg, Carl Rackemann and Terry Alderman. His involvement in this tour re-ignited suspicions that he was one of the covert organizers, but it was the last time Wessels ever represented Australia in cricket. Frank Heydenrych, writing for the 1991 Wisden, comments upon Eastern Province's success during this season: :...from the way that Kepler Wessels, (the Eastern Province captain), had reinforced their playing squad with high-quality players, it was difficult to see an immediate end to the golden days (and nights) he had brought to Eastern Province. In 1989/90 Wessels also played for South Africa against a rebel English team captained by Mike Gatting. He scored 1 & 2 in the only match played, which South Africa won.  Captain of the 'new' South Africa  With apartheid being removed from South Africa in 1991, the International Cricket Council unanimously removed the ban against playing South Africa. As a result, South Africa could now play Test and One-day international cricket. = The 1992 Cricket World Cup = When South Africa played its first Test since March 1970, ten of the eleven players were making their debuts. At 34, Wessels had both the first-class experience of contemporaries such as Clive Rice and Jimmy Cook, but also had experience at Test level that no other South African player had. As a result of these credentials, he was chosen to captain the inexperienced South African side to the 1992 Cricket World Cup, which would signal the country's return to official international cricket. The decision to name Wessels captain over such local heroes as Rice and Cook (who both didn't even make the side) was met by widespread controversy. More than 10 000 signatures were collected for a petition against the dropping of Rice and Cook, while 71 percent of provincial players told the Sunday Times in South Africa, that they had no confidence in the selectors. Despite the local outrage, Wessels led the unknown South African side in the tournament. Playing against Australia in their opening match, they produced what was arguably the biggest surprise of the tournament, beating the hosts by nine wickets. However, the spectacular victory was followed by consecutive defeats against New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Once again, criticism against Wessels started to mount back in South Africa, with many analysts believing that South Africa's problems were caused by the captain's conservative approach to one-day cricket. South Africa desperately needed to win their next match against the West Indies and, thanks to a vicious bowling assault on their batsmen, the South Africans claimed victory. They won their remaining matches against Pakistan and Zimbabwe, but lost against England. The last group match against India was now vital if they were to reach the semi- finals of the tournament. Rain-delays caused the match to be played 30 overs a side and, once again, South Africa managed to secure victory after India set an imposing target. Wessels and his team were to play against England in Sydney. Four days before the semi-final, South African President F.W. de Klerk called a referendum on political reform in South Africa, and the result of the vote seemed vital for South Africa's continuing in the Cricket World Cup. Some even suggested that the team would be withdrawn from the tournament, if the result of the referendum had been negative. The result of 68.7% in favour of political reform, ensured not only the cricket team's continuing participation in the tournament, but also the future participation of other South African sports teams in international competitions. The semi-final against England took place on 22 March 1992 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. England reached a total of 252 for 6 (in 45 overs) and South Africa required a run-rate of 5.62 to win. With 13 balls left in the match, they required 22 more runs, when rain suddenly started pouring down over Sydney. Two overs (or 12 balls) were lost and when play resumed, South Africa's new target was calculated by subtracting the number of runs England had scored in their two least productive overs (those totalling just one run). South Africa thus required 21 runs off one ball, although the scoreboard initially displayed a target of 22. The last ball was played with batsman Brian MacMillan scoring a single, and South Africa lost the semi-final by 19 runs. The team did a lap of honor around the Sydney Cricket Ground, providing one of the most lasting images of the tournament. = 1991/92 tour of the West Indies = South Africa narrowly lost to a West Indian team featuring such players as Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Patrick Patterson, Desmond Haynes and Brian Lara. South Africa, under Wessels' leadership, controlled most of the match but fell for 148 chasing 201 for victory in the final innings. This was blamed on remarkable bowling from the West Indian pacemen, with one reporter commenting; 'They [Walsh and Ambrose] pitched everything on off stump and let a pitch stricken by multiple- personality disorder do the rest. Each perfect delivery was followed by another perfect delivery. It was as if Richie Richardson had found a loophole in the laws that allowed him to unleash the same unplayable bowler from both ends. Fittingly, that Wambrose bloke ended up with 10 wickets.' Wessels contributed 59 and 74 in this Test. = 1993/94 tour of Australia and 1994 tour of England = During the 1993/94 international season, Wessels' cricketing career reached full circle, as he captained the South African side in a tour to Australia. The first Test match of the tour, in Melbourne, was drawn. The second, and arguably most memorable, test was played out in front of a capacity crowd in Sydney. It turned out to be Wessels' last match of the tour, following a hand injury during play. Shane Warne took seven wickets in the first innings and everything seemed lost for the South Africans. However, thanks to some heroic bowling and batting by the visitors, Australia was eventually set a winning target of 117 runs in the second innings. The home side was bowled out for 110 runs, and South Africa won their first Test match against Australia since 1969. Wessels was forced to return to South Africa because of his injury, thus missing out on the rest of the tour. He was, however, immediately reinstated as captain for the home series against Australia. The series was drawn 1‚Äì1, and Wessels was criticized for 'baffling' captaincy in the final Test by failing to declare and allowing the tail to score slowly when South Africa seemed to be in a position to win the match and the series. He led the side to England in the summer of 1994, drawing the three Test series 1‚Äì1. Following a heavy defeat at the Oval, however, where he made the second highest score of 28 with the bat during a major collapse in the second innings, he retired from Test cricket and was replaced as captain by Hansie Cronje.  After retirement  After retiring he coached English county side Northamptonshire from 2003 to 2006. His son, Riki Wessels, also played for the club as a Kolpak player. In 2008, he was chosen to coach the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He later moved to the Highveld Lions franchise in South Africa as a consultant. In 2018, Wessels became a member of the Cricket Australia Supplementary Referee Panel.  Criticism  Wessels was the subject of much criticism during his cricket career, especially from his country of birth, South Africa. It ranged from doubts over his ability to play one-day cricket, his \\"ugly\\" stance to his style of captaining as well as his rather serious approach to the game. = Ability to play one-day cricket = Wessels was, at times, heavily criticised for his alleged inability to play one-day cricket. Although he played 109 One Day Internationals for both Australia and South Africa, he averaged only 34.35, at a strike rate of 55.3, and scored only one ODI century in his career. From the Channel Nine commentary box, Tony Greig went as far as to say that Wessels \\"went through a period when his temperament was totally against everything that one-day cricket stood for.\\" Wessels pointed out that he fulfilled the anchor role in the side and that it was his job to bat throughout an innings. Former Australian captain and teammate Kim Hughes, had publicly supported Wessels on this fact, saying: \\"Kepler hits so many boundaries that he is always going to score enough runs and, even in one-day cricket, you need someone who can anchor the innings. He's the bloke I want in that role.\\" Despite the criticism, Wessels collected many player's accolades during his ODI career, including the \\"Man of the Series\\" award during the 1983 ODI series against the West Indies, as well as the \\"Man of the Match\\" award for his 81 not out against Australia in the 1992 World Cup. He was never dismissed for a duck during his 105 ODI innings; no other retired player can boast this feat for a career longer than 50 innings. = Captaincy = During the 1989 Currie Cup final in Port Elizabeth, Wessels angered South African cricket authorities by letting his Eastern Province side bat deep into the third day, without declaring the first innings closed. He was accused of killing the game and ruining what was supposed to be the annual showpiece of South African cricket, by not giving his opponents, Transvaal, a fair chance at batting. However, the decision proved to be correct from an Eastern Province point of view, as the home side managed to bowl Transvaal out twice by the fifth day, thereby winning by an innings and 103 runs. As captain of the national side, Wessels was similarly criticized for playing too conservatively in South Africa's first test series since readmission into international cricket. Although South Africa won the home series against India by 1‚Äì0, fans and critics sharpened their pencils and attacked the captain mercilessly for his team's apparent lack of passion and ambition. The fourth test in Cape Town, in particular, was condemned across the cricketing world. The two teams scored a total of 795 runs in 433.4 overs, at an average of only 1.83 runs per over and ended in a draw.

Previously, as an administrator, he served as Chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board, caretaker Federal Minister of Pakistan and Chief Minister of Punjab, Pakistan. As a journalist, he is a left-leaning political commentator who serves as the editor-in-chief of The Friday Times and serves as Chairman of Pakistan Super League. He has also served as the caretaker chief minister of Punjab during the 2013 election. He formerly used to host primetime current affairs show Aapas ki Baat on Geo News. He is currently the President of AAP Media Media Network / Indus News. Najam Sethi began his sociopolitical endeavours with the socialist movement working for the rights of Baluchistan, leading to his arrest in 1975 before being discharged in 1978. He consequently left politics and established Vanguard Books, a progressive book publishing company. In 1989, Sethi along with his wife Jugnu Mohsin launched an independent English weekly, The Friday Times. He was arrested by the second Nawaz Sharif government in 1999 on trumped-up charges of treason before being released by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. In 2002, he founded the Daily Times of Pakistan and became its editor until leaving in October 2009. He also served as the Pakistan correspondent of The Economist from 1990 to 2008. Sethi won the 1999 International Press Freedom Award of the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists and the 2009 World Association of Newspapers' Golden Pen of Freedom Award. On 26 March 2013, his name was approved for the interim position of the chief minister of Punjab as a result of consensus between members of the selection committee comprising individuals from both the governing and the opposing political parties. He took the oath on 27 March 2013, and left the office after the May 2013 elections on 6 June 2013.  Career  According to Sethi, he first conceived of the idea for an independent Pakistani newspaper out of frustration: while briefly imprisoned in 1984 on trumped-up copyright charges, no newspapers had protested his arrest. The following year, he and Mohsin applied for a publishing licence under Mohsin's name, since Sethi was \\"too notorious an offender\\" to be approved. Called into Nawaz Sharif's office to discuss the application, Mohsin told him that she intended to publish \\"a social chit chat thing, you know, with lots of pictures of parties and weddings\\". It was finally approved in 1987, but Mohsin requested a one-year delay to avoid the first issue coming out during the dictatorship of General Zia ul Haq. The paper's first issue appeared in May 1989. =1999 arrest= In early 1999, Sethi gave an interview to a team for the British Broadcasting Corporation television show Correspondent, which was planning to report on corruption in the Nawaz Sharif government. At the beginning of May, he was warned by contacts that his co- operation with the team was being interpreted by the Nawaz Sharif government as an attempt to destabilize it and that officials were planning Sethi's arrest. On 8 May, he was taken from his home by personnel of Punjab Police. According to Sethi's wife Mohsin, at least eight armed officers broke into the house, assaulting the family's security guards; when asked to produce a warrant, one of them threatened simply to shoot Sethi on the spot. Mohsin was tied up and left locked in another room. Sethi was then held for almost a month without charge. He was kept incommunicado at a detention center in Lahore. Amnesty International stated its belief that his arrest was connected with his investigations into government corruption, and designated him a prisoner of conscience. The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists also sent a protest letter to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, noting the organisation's dismay \\"that the state continues its persecution of independent journalists\\", and World Bank president James Wolfensohn called Sharif to urge Sethi's release. On 1 June, authorities charged Sethi with \\"Condemnation of the Creation of the State and Advocacy of Abolition of its Sovereignty\\" and \\"Promoting Enmity Between Different Groups\\" and transferred him to police custody. However, the following day, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the government had provided insufficient evidence to justify Sethi's detention. He was released, and the charges against him were dropped. =My Feudal Lord= In June 1991, Mohsin and Sethi's publishing company, Vanguard Books, released Tehmina Durrani's My Feudal Lord, a \\"politically explosive\\" book about her marriage with leading politician Mustafa Khar. In the book, Durrani alleges that Khar mistreated and abused her. It was an \\"instant sensation\\" and later became the \\"hottest book in Pakistan's history\\". Durrani signed a contract vesting foreign rights with Mohsin and giving her 50% of foreign royalties. On 19 May 1999, however‚Äîduring Sethi's one-month incommunicado detention‚ÄîDurrani called a press conference to denounce him as having stolen all of her earnings from the book, stating that his actions were \\"an even bigger case of hypocrisy than my experience with the feudal system\\". Durrani sued Sethi for mental torture, and he countersued for defamation. An earlier dispute over the foreign rights had been settled out of court in 1992. A review of the contracts by the UK newspaper The Independent described Sethi as acting in good faith and described him and Mohsin as \\"the injured party\\". In 2008, when Sethi's newspapers ran a series of editorials opposing religious fundamentalism, the Taliban threatened him with death, causing him to live under constant guard. Sethi also received death threats in July 2008 for publishing an editorial cartoon showing Umme Hassaan, principal of a girls' school, encouraging young women in burqas to \\"kidnap Chinese masseuses\\". The joke referred to Lal Masjid, the fundamentalist mosque at which her husband Abdul Aziz Ghazi was a cleric; the mosque had kidnapped six Chinese women that it accused of being prostitutes, leading to Ghazi's arrest. = Caretaker Chief Minister of Punjab = Najam Sethi was appointed as the caretaker Chief Minister (CM) Punjab on 26 March 2013, for the 'General Elections 2013', which were scheduled to be held on 11 May 2013. His name was presented by PPP (Pakistan Peoples Party) and the opposition, PML-N (Pakistan Muslim League ‚Äì Nawaz) agreed on it. He then became the Chief Minister of Pakistan's province, Punjab. On 6 June 2013, he stepped down in favour of the newly elected Pakistan Muslim League ‚Äì Nawaz (PML-N) leader Shahbaz Sharif. PTI, the party that lost the 2013 elections, had accused Najam Sethi of fixing the elections in 35 constituencies. =Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board= Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif appointed him as the acting chairman Pakistan Cricket Board after the Islamabad High Court ordered the appointment of an interim chairman until a pending case on the serving chairman, Zaka Ashraf, was decided. Later, a two-member bench of Islamabad high court cleared Zaka Ashraf and ordered his restoration as chairman PCB. Sethi then relinquished chairmanship.  Personal life  Sethi is married to fellow journalist Jugnu Mohsin, the publisher of The Friday Times. The couple have two children: author and singer Ali Sethi and journalist and actress Mira Sethi.  Awards and recognition  In 1999, Sethi and Mohsin were both given the International Press Freedom Award of the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which recognises journalists who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threats, or imprisonment. Ten years later, he was awarded the 2009 Golden Pen of Freedom, the annual press freedom prize of the World Association of Newspapers.

She is larger and less talkative than the other robots. Gypsy normally only appears during the show's host segments and introduction, but briefly took a seat in the theater to watch the movie in episode #412 (Hercules and the Captive Women). She only delivered a couple of \\"riffs\\" ‚Äì partially because she took the movie and what the 'boys' were saying too literally, and left after realizing how bad the movie was. Along with the other robots, Gypsy was designed and built by series creator Joel Hodgson. He named Gypsy after a pet turtle his brother once owned, as the robot's size and ponderousness reminded him of the turtle. Role According to the MST3K storyline, Gypsy takes care of the higher functions on board the Satellite of Love. She needs to use most of her computing power to handle this responsibility, which generally makes her appear slow-witted when dealing with others. The episode #207: Wild Rebels briefly demonstrated a much brighter Gypsy when the demand on her systems was temporarily reduced. (She also made a quick appearance in the theater during this experiment when someone mentioned Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, on account of her oft-stated fascination for the show's star, Richard Basehart). As the series progressed, she became a more frequent participant in the host segments, and appeared more intelligent, even attempting to sit in on an experiment during one of the Hercules films, Hercules and the Captive Women. But she begged out after a few minutes when she \\"realized there were these things\\" she had to go take care of. Gypsy is a big fan of Richard Basehart; her brain was once X-rayed, and found to contain RAM chips and a photo of Basehart. She is also a notary. Gypsy played a key role in the series' overall plot in episode #512, Mitchell, when she overheard the Mads discussing killing Mike Nelson, who was currently working at Gizmonic Institute as a temp, and mistakenly believed they were plotting to kill Joel. Terrified, she worked to come up with a plan to help Joel escape. Talking with Mike over the viewscreen, they were able to locate an escape pod. At the end of the episode, Gypsy launched Joel off of the Satellite of Love in the pod, marking Joel's departure as a regular character. The Mads then abandon their plan to kill Mike, and instead use him as the new human test subject. Mike became the regular host for the remainder of the series' original run. In season six, the show introduced a device usually referred to as the Umbilicus, although in some episodes it was referred to as either the Umbilicon or the Umbiliport. The Umbilicus was a long tether that connected the Satellite of Love to the underground lair Deep 13, and allowed objects to be sent back and forth between Mike and the mad scientists who had stranded him in orbit. In its first appearance on the show, in episode #601: Girls Town, the Umbilicus was directly connected to Gypsy's snake-like body, with objects being sent or received through her mouth. The receiving station was later changed to an oven-like hatch on the bridge of the Satellite of Love. Gypsy also developed an independent bohemian feminist side to her personality, beginning with the Creeping Terror episode during the Mad Scientist's \\"coffeehouse poseur\\" experiment, when she sang, 'you, the middle-class white male, are my personal oppressor!'. As the series progressed, she penned her own one-woman, cabaret show; \\"Gypsy Rose Me!\\" (a reference to burlesque performer Gypsy Rose Lee). After the Satellite of Love crashed into the Earth in the final episode of the original run of MST3K (#1013: Diabolik), Gypsy is not present with Mike and the Bots in their shared apartment. Tom Servo is seen reviewing a \\"ConGypsCo Annual Report\\", and the guys reflect on their failure to have taken up new corporate mogul Gypsy on her public offering. During KTMA episode #6, Gamera vs. Gaos, Joel claimed to have tried to program her voice to resemble Kim Carnes, but failed. In a sketch in episode #13, SST: Death Flight, Gypsy was uniquely voiced and operated by a woman (Faye Burkholder). In episode #409, The Indestructible Man, Gypsy swapped voices with Magic Voice in the opening host segment. In the Season 1 premiere, Gypsy managed to uncoil herself, revealing that she was at least fifty feet long. Joel explained that he just kept making her longer and longer compulsively when he built her (comparing it to, \\"When you start connecting paper clips, you get hooked on it...\\"). Hodgson confirmed that Gypsy would appear in the 2017 revival series, where she is played by Rebecca Hanson, an alum of The Second City. Hodgson reworked how Gypsy would be constructed and interact with the Satellite crew as to correct some of the faults he found in her appearance in the original series; while she still operates the ship, the power of cloud computing allows this responsibility to be shared among all the 'bots, and she will be able to dedicate more of her computation cycles to participating in conversation, including appearing in some of the theater riffing. In addition, she now travels through the SoL via the overhead flyspace, and now speaks in a feminine midwest accent, thanks to some upgrades provided by Jonah Heston, the new human test subject. After the return of the show in 2017, some internet users wanted her name to be changed, claiming that \\"Gypsy\\" is now widely viewed as an ethnic slur against Romani and other itinerant peoples. Joel eventually acquiesced to these demands and created a new version, now called \\"GPC\\". Behind the scenes Gypsy's head was built out of a \\"Century Infant Love Seat\\". Parts of an Eveready flashlight were used for her eye, the white rubber \\"hood\\" portion generally absent after the first couple of seasons. Foam tubing was used on her lips (usually a dull light gray), and her neck was made of a long black PVC hose. The head portion was painted a metallic purple, with a small amount of metallic blue on the inside of her mouth. Occasionally the tubing of her lips is colored red, giving the effect that she's wearing lipstick. During the initial KTMA season a different children's car seat was used for the head portion, the entire puppet painted a copper color. Also during this season, her name was sometimes given as \\"Gypsum.\\" This Gypsy, with small alterations, would later be used for Cambot during the opening of season one episodes. During the KTMA season, Gypsy's voice and operation were handled by Josh Weinstein. From the first to eighth nationally telecast seasons, Gypsy was voiced and handled by Jim Mallon, who was one of the producers and writers on the show. Starting midway through season 8 in episode #815, Agent for H.A.R.M., the job of operating and voicing Gypsy was handed over to Patrick Brantseg, who also performed most of the puppetry during filming of Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie so as to allow Jim Mallon to focus on directing rather than working the puppet. Patrick Brantseg would handle the role for the remainder of the series. For the briefly-running MST3K Flash series on the show's official website in 2007, Jim Mallon once again provided the voice of Gypsy.

It is through Cambot's \\"eye\\" that viewers watch Joel Robinson (later Mike Nelson and subsequently Jonah Heston) and the other robots as they watch the movies that are sent to the Satellite of Love each week.  Appearance  Cambot is only seen during the \\"Robot Roll Call\\" portion of the opening credits, often with his name reversed, presumably to imply he is shooting his own image in a mirror. His appearance was changed with almost every reshooting of the opening credits. In the original KTMA season, Cambot was depicted as a robot operating a separate camera. Season 1 Cambot was a modification of the KTMA Gypsy, with an integrated camera, whereas later Cambot incarnations more closely resembled television recording equipment. In episode #507, I Accuse My Parents, Gypsy presented a drawing that depicted the Satellite of Loves crew as her \\"ideal family\\"; in the drawing, Cambot's torso was shown as a long and snakelike tube, not unlike Gypsy's. Midway through the fifth season of the series the opening was once again reshot, and Cambot was again redesigned, this time with a more compact shape, becoming a round hovering ball with a TV camera vidicon sensor for an eye. He would keep this form for the remainder of the series, although the color scheme was changed during MST3K's switch from Comedy Central to the Sci Fi Channel (becoming blue instead of gray). With the relaunch of the series with Season 11, Cambot underwent another drastic redesign, now appearing much more like a giant lens now with mock studio lighting camera reflectors. He appears to be attached to the ceiling by some kind of long mount.  Overview  Cambot acts as an audio-visual conduit between the crew of the Satellite of Love and their observers. He also apparently joins Joel, Mike, Crow T. Robot, and Tom Servo in the theatre when a movie is shown, and records the cast watching the film. Apparently the footage he shoots in the theater is what the Mads end up seeing, as evidenced by Frank once saying \\"You think you have it bad? We have to watch you watching the movie.\\" Although a number of episodes depict the cast reacting as if traumatized by a particularly bad movie, Cambot suffered a severe reaction only once, weeping when several security cameras were systematically destroyed by the hero in episode #620: Danger!! Death Ray. (This was signified by a watery effect over the screen image.) Another rare case of Cambot interacting during a movie segment came in episode #202: The Sidehackers, when Cambot added a mock ESPN scorecard on one side of the screen during the movie's race scenes. Cambot also frequently provides music, video clips, and other enhancements to host segments. When Joel or another character requests to see through \\"Rocket Number Nine\\" (the ship-mounted camera that allows the crew to see the ship's exterior and anything in its vicinity), it is Cambot who provides the image. During the first five seasons, when Joel or Mike would read fan mail sent to the show, they would request Cambot to put the letter on \\"still store,\\" freeze framing on a close-up of the letter. Cambot was voiced a single time during the original KTMA run by Kevin Murphy. At the end of Season 7, Cambot was shown joining his fellow crew-members ascending into pure energy at the end of the universe. When the Satellite of Love crashed on Earth in the show's final episode, it is not specified whether Cambot survived the crash (although one could assume that he is the one filming the final scene). Cambot was not mentioned in Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie. Cambot is revealed to have survived the crash in the Netflix revival of the series.

Captain Stephen Decatur, Sr., was appointed to command and outfit her for sea. During the Quasi-War with France, Delaware cruised to protect American merchant shipping from French privateers.

The army originated as the Reserve Corps during the preparations for the British part of the Somme Offensive of 1916, was renamed Reserve Army when it was expanded and became the Fifth Army in October 1916. History The Fifth Army was created on 30 October 1916, by renaming the Reserve Army (General Hubert Gough). It participated in the Battle of the Ancre, which became the final British effort in the Battle of the Somme. In 1917, the Fifth Army was involved in the Battle of Arras and then the Third Battle of Ypres. The following year, the Fifth Army took over a stretch of front-line previously occupied by the French south of the River Somme and on 21 March, bore the brunt of the opening phase of the German Spring Offensive, known as Operation Michael. The failure of the Fifth Army to withstand the German advance led to Gough's dismissal and replacement by General Henry Rawlinson on 28 March and on 2 April, the army was renamed the Fourth Army. Gough and his remaining staff officers were to be renamed the Reserve Army with a headquarters at Cr√©cy-en-Ponthieu, to survey a defensive line west of Amiens as a precaution and to oversee the building of all GHQ lines.

It is an important intermediate in the production of titanium metal and the pigment titanium dioxide. TiCl4 is a volatile liquid. Upon contact with humid air, it forms spectacular opaque clouds of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and hydrated hydrogen chloride. It is sometimes referred to as \\"tickle\\" or \\"tickle 4\\" due to the phonetic resemblance of its molecular formula (TiCl4) to the word. American Chemistry Council ‚Äì \\"Titanium Tetrachloride: Stepping Stone to Amazing Technology\\" Iowa State University ‚Äì \\"Chemistry Material Safety Data Sheets\\" Properties and structure TiCl4 is a dense, colourless distillable liquid, although crude samples may be yellow or even red-brown. It is one of the rare transition metal halides that is a liquid at room temperature, VCl4 being another example. This property reflects the fact that molecules of TiCl4 weakly self-associate. Most metal chlorides are polymers, wherein the chloride atoms bridge between the metals. Its melting and boiling points are similar to those of CCl4. Ti4+ has a \\"closed\\" electronic shell, with the same number of electrons as the inert gas argon. The tetrahedral structure for TiCl4 is consistent with its description as a d0 metal center (Ti4+) surrounded by four identical ligands. This configuration leads to highly symmetrical structures, hence the tetrahedral shape of the molecule. TiCl4 adopts similar structures to TiBr4 and TiI4; the three compounds share many similarities. TiCl4 and TiBr4 react to give mixed halides TiCl4‚àíxBrx, where x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Magnetic resonance measurements also indicate that halide exchange is also rapid between TiCl4 and VCl4. TiCl4 is soluble in toluene and chlorocarbons. Certain arenes form complexes of the type [(C6R6)TiCl3]+. TiCl4 reacts exothermically with donor solvents such as THF to give hexacoordinated adducts. Bulkier ligands (L) give pentacoordinated adducts TiCl4L. Production TiCl4 is produced by the chloride process, which involves the reduction of titanium oxide ores, typically ilmenite (FeTiO3), with carbon under flowing chlorine at 900 ¬∞C. Impurities are removed by distillation. :2 FeTiO3 \\\\+ 7 Cl2 \\\\+ 6 C ‚Üí 2 TiCl4 \\\\+ 2 FeCl3 \\\\+ 6 CO The coproduction of FeCl3 is undesirable, which has motivated the development of alternative technologies. Instead of directly using ilmenite, \\"rutile slag\\" is used. This material, an impure form of TiO2, is derived from ilmenite by removal of iron, either using carbon reduction or extraction with sulfuric acid. Crude TiCl4 contains a variety of other volatile halides, including vanadyl chloride (VOCl3), silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), and tin tetrachloride (SnCl4), which must be separated. Applications =Production of titanium metal= The world's supply of titanium metal, about 250,000 tons per year, is made from TiCl4. The conversion involves the reduction of the tetrachloride with magnesium metal. This procedure is known as the Kroll process: :2 Mg + TiCl4 ‚Üí 2 MgCl2 \\\\+ Ti In the Hunter process, liquid sodium is the reducing agent instead of magnesium. =Production of titanium dioxide= Around 90% of the TiCl4 production is used to make the pigment titanium dioxide (TiO2). The conversion involves hydrolysis of TiCl4, a process that forms hydrogen chloride: :TiCl4 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí TiO2 \\\\+ 4 HCl In some cases, TiCl4 is oxidised directly with oxygen: :TiCl4 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí TiO2 \\\\+ 2 Cl2 =Smoke screens= It has been used to produce smoke screens since it produces a heavy, white smoke that has little tendency to rise. Chemical reactions Titanium tetrachloride is a versatile reagent that forms diverse derivatives including those illustrated below. 500px =Hydrolysis and related reactions= The most noteworthy reaction of TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by the release of hydrogen chloride and the formation of titanium oxides and oxychlorides, as described above for the production of TiO2. Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens. The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly refractive titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This smoke is however corrosive. Alcohols react with TiCl4 to give the corresponding alkoxides with the formula [Ti(OR)4]n (R = alkyl, n = 1, 2, 4). As indicated by their formula, these alkoxides can adopt complex structures ranging from monomers to tetramers. Such compounds are useful in materials science as well as organic synthesis. A well known derivative is titanium isopropoxide, which is a monomer. Organic amines react with TiCl4 to give complexes containing amido (R2N‚àí-containing) and imido (RN2‚àí-containing) complexes. With ammonia, titanium nitride is formed. An illustrative reaction is the synthesis of tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium Ti(NMe2)4, a yellow, benzene-soluble liquid: This molecule is tetrahedral, with planar nitrogen centers. : 4 LiNMe2 \\\\+ TiCl4 ‚Üí 4 LiCl + Ti(NMe2)4 =Complexes with simple ligands= TiCl4 is a Lewis acid as implicated by its tendency to hydrolyze. With the ether THF, TiCl4 reacts to give yellow crystals of TiCl4(THF)2. With chloride salts, TiCl4 reacts to form sequentially [Ti2Cl9]‚àí, [Ti2Cl10]2‚àí (see figure above), and [TiCl6]2‚àí. The reaction of chloride ions with TiCl4 depends on the counterion. NBu4Cl and TiCl4 gives the pentacoordinate complex NBu4TiCl5, whereas smaller gives (NEt4)2Ti2Cl10. These reactions highlight the influence of electrostatics on the structures of compounds with highly ionic bonding. =Redox= Reduction of TiCl4 with aluminium results in one-electron reduction. The trichloride (TiCl3) and tetrachloride have contrasting properties: the trichloride is a solid, being a coordination polymer, and is paramagnetic. When the reduction is conducted in THF solution, the Ti(III) product converts to the light-blue adduct TiCl3(THF)3. =Organometallic chemistry= The organometallic chemistry of titanium typically starts from TiCl4. An important reaction involves sodium cyclopentadienyl to give titanocene dichloride, TiCl2(C5H5)2. This compound and many of its derivatives are precursors to Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalysts. Tebbe's reagent, useful in organic chemistry, is an aluminium-containing derivative of titanocene that arises from the reaction of titanocene dichloride with trimethylaluminium. It is used for the \\"olefination\\" reactions. Arenes, such as C6(CH3)6 react to give the piano-stool complexes [Ti(C6R6)Cl3]+ (R = H, CH3; see figure above). This reaction illustrates the high Lewis acidity of the entity, which is generated by abstraction of chloride from TiCl4 by AlCl3. =Reagent in organic synthesis= TiCl4 finds occasional use in organic synthesis, capitalizing on its Lewis acidity, its oxophilicity, and the electron-transfer properties of its reduced titanium halides It is used in the Lewis acid catalysed aldol additionMariappan Periasamy (2002): \\"New synthetic methods using the TiCl4-NR3 reagent system\\", ARKIVOC, p. 151-166. Key to this application is the tendency of TiCl4 to activate aldehydes (RCHO) by formation of adducts such as (RCHO)TiCl4OC(H)R. Toxicity and safety considerations Hazards posed by titanium tetrachloride generally arise from the release of hydrogen chloride (HCl). TiCl4 is a strong Lewis acid, exothermically forming adducts with even weak bases such as THF and explosively with water, releasing HCl.

Life Map showing major events of Gongsun Zan's life. Little is known of Gongsun Zan's early life. He and Liu Bei studied under the tutelage of Lu Zhi. At the time, the administrator of his home commandery appreciated Gongsun Zan's impressive looks and booming voice, so he arranged for his daughter to marry him. Gongsun Zan was deployed by He Jin to quash rebellions in the north which he did successfully. Following a misunderstanding with his lord, Liu Yu, Gongsun attacked Liu and won control of the surrounding areas; however, contrary to popular belief, he was never formally appointed as a commandery administrator. During this time his former classmate Liu Bei came to serve him and was allocated the city of Pingyuan to defend. Zhao Yun displays valour in front of Gongsun Zan To the south, the two brothers Yuan Shao in the north and Yuan Shu in the south vied for supremacy over central China. Gongsun Zan formed an alliance with Yuan Shu and sent his second cousin, Gongsun Yue, to help Yuan Shu's general, Sun Jian, retake Yangcheng. However, Gongsun Yue died in the campaign. Using this as pretext, Gongsun Zan attacked Yuan Shao after his initial plan to gain Han Fu's lands went awry. However, Gongsun Zan was defeated by Yuan Shao at the Battle of Yijing. He committed suicide by setting himself on fire, after killing his wife and sisters. Family * Gongsun Yue (), Gongsun Zan's younger second cousin. Gongsun Zan sent him with 1,000 troops and supplies to assist the warlord Yuan Shu, who was in a proxy war with his half-brother Yuan Shao. Gongsun Yue died after being hit by a stray arrow during the Battle of Yangcheng in 191 while fighting alongside Sun Jian (Yuan Shu's proxy) against Zhou Yu (Renming) (Yuan Shao's proxy). Gongsun Zan used Gongsun Yue's death as an excuse to declare war on Yuan Shao. ** In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Gongsun Yue is Gongsun Zan's younger brother. Gongsun Zan sends Gongsun Yue as a messenger to demand that Yuan Shao keep his promise by dividing Ji Province between him and Gongsun Zan after seizing it from Han Fu, but Yuan Shao refuses. While Gongsun Yue is on his return journey, Yuan Shao orders his men to pretend to be Dong Zhuo's soldiers and then ambush and kill Gongsun Yue. Gongsun Zan sees through Yuan Shao's ruse and subsequently declares war on him. * Gongsun Fan (), Gongsun Zan's younger second cousin. He leads troops from Bohai Commandery () to join Gongsun Zan. He also fought in the Battle of Jieqiao alongside Gongsun Zan against Yuan Shao. * Gongsun Xu (), Gongsun Zan's son. During the Battle of Yijing (198‚Äì199), Gongsun Zan sent him to seek reinforcements from the Heishan bandits led by Zhang Yan. They returned too late as Gongsun Zan had already been defeated by Yuan Shao and had committed suicide along with the rest of his family. Gongsun Xu later met his end at the hands of the Tuge (), a Xiongnu tribe. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Gongsun Zan is a character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He leads an elite cavalry unit called the \\"White Riders\\" and has served on the northern and eastern frontiers of the Han Empire by defending the borders from incursions by various non-Han Chinese tribes. In 191, Gongsun Zan joins the coalition against Dong Zhuo, the warlord who seized power in Luoyang and holds the figurehead Emperor Xian hostage. After the coalition breaks up, he gets into a rivalry with Yuan Shao over the territories in northern China and engages him in a series of battles throughout the 190s, starting with the Battle of Jieqiao and ending with his defeat and death at the Battle of Yijing. In the novel, Gongsun Zan is nicknamed \\"White Horse General\\" because the elite cavalry unit he leads is made up completely of horses of pure white. The reason for doing so is that he knows that the non-Han Chinese tribes consider white horses sacred animals so they will run away when they encounter an enemy unit riding white horses in battle. In Records of the Three Kingdoms Gongsun Zan's white horse volunteers () has historical basis, and appears in the historical records as an elite mounted unit on white horses which formed the core of his fighting force.

Powers and abilities As King of the Norse Gods, Odin possesses vast strength, stamina and durability far greater than that of a normal Asgardian, along with resistance to all Earthly diseases and toxins, incredible resistance to magic and, as a courtesy of the Golden Apples of Idunn, a greatly extended lifespan. Odin has all the abilities of his son Thor, but to a much greater degree.

Other versions =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel imprint, Odin is referenced as far back as The Ultimates (mostly by Thor),Ultimates #1-13 but the way the series is initially written leaves the reader unsure whether or not Odin or Asgard actually exist as Thor is portrayed as human with Norse God delusions and technology that gives him his Godlike powers. In the final issue of The Ultimates 2, Thor proves his claims to be a genuine god by killing Thor and summoning an army of Asgardian warriors to help the Ultimates defend Loki's army of monsters. Thor references Odin in his last conversation with Loki before he destroys him, sending him back to Odin. When the Ultimates begin to be financed by Tony Stark after their retirement from S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor informs that this is indeed the will of Odin.The Ultimates 2#1-13 In Ultimate Comics: Thor, a prequel to The Ultimates, Odin explains to Thor that he is Asgard, and when he dies Asgard will be destroyed with him. He also informs that the Norn Stones and Mjolnir are extensions of his own power. When Loki leads an army of Frost Giants to invade and destroy Asgard, Odin forces Loki into the Room With No Doors and is killed in the battle with Mammoth. Asgard disintegrates around him with Thor giving one last powerful strike at his enemies. In present day, leading up to The Ultimates, Thor and Balder are reincarnated as mortals and Balder (reincarnated as the Ultimate version of Donald Blake) explains that the Gods are to be restored and Odin will return to rule Asgard again.Ultimate Comics: Thor #1-4 He is later killed in Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates but unlike the tradition of Ultimate Marvel characters to remain deceased, Odin and the other Asgardians are still active (of sorts), as they appear to Thor in visions and act as a sixth sense for him.

The rules governing registration vary between jurisdictions. In most jurisdictions, voting and registration is optional, while in others (such as in Australia) registration and voting are compulsory for citizens of voting age. In some jurisdictions, enrolment may require an application being made by an eligible voter and registered persons to re- register or update registration details when they change residence or other relevant information changes. In some jurisdictions, an enrolment agency may receive change of address information from other government agencies, which is used to automatically update voter details; for example, when a person registers a change of residence with a government agency for, say, a driver's license, the government agency may forward the information to the electoral agency to update voter registration details. Some jurisdictions have \\"election day registration\\" and others do not require registration, or may require production of evidence of entitlement to vote at time of voting. In jurisdictions where registration is not mandatory, an effort may be made to encourage persons otherwise eligible to vote to register, in what is called as a voter registration drive. In countries where resident registration is compulsory, voter registration usually does not exist, since voter eligibility can be determined from the residence register. Even in countries where registration is the individual's responsibility, many reformers, seeking to maximize voter turnout, argue for a wider availability of the required forms, or more ease of process by having more places where they can register. The United States, for example, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (\\"Motor Voter Law\\") and similar laws require states to offer voter registration at motor vehicle departments (driver's license offices) as well as disability centers, public schools, and public libraries, in order to offer more access to the system. State authorities are also required to accept mail- in voter registrations. Many jurisdictions also offer online registrations. Effects and controversy Registration laws making it harder for voters to register correlate strongly with lower percentages of people turning out to vote where voting is voluntary.For the U.S, see Julianna Pacheco and Eric Plutzer, \\"How State Electoral Institutions Influence the Electoral Participation of Young Citizens\\", Department of Political Science, Penn State University, 2007, i + 18 pp. Historically in the United States, the southern states of the former Confederacy passed new constitutions and laws at the turn of the century that created barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and complicated record keeping requirements. In practice, in their system of Jim Crow, these elements were used to disenfranchise most African Americans and many poor whites from voting, excluding thousands of people in each state from the political system. The minority of white Democrats in these states controlled the political process and elections, gaining outsize power locally and in Congress as the Solid South. The states maintained such exclusion of most African Americans for more than 60 years. Other minority groups have also been discriminated against by other states at various times in voter registration practices, such as Native Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and other language minorities. Because of this history, voter registration laws and practices in the United States have been closely scrutinized by interest groups and the federal government, especially following passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It authorized federal oversight of jurisdictions with a history of under-representation of certain portions of their populations in voting. Such laws are often controversial. Some advocate for their abolition, while others argue that the laws should be reformed, for instance: to allow voters to register on the day of the election. Several US states - Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming - have adopted this approach, called Election Day Registration. For the 2012 election year, California joined this list. Registration of voters internationally Systems of voter registration vary widely from country to country, and sometimes among lower jurisdictions, such as states or provinces. In some nations, voters are automatically added to the rolls when they reach legal voting age. In others, potential voters are required to apply to be added to the rolls. =Australia= Voter registration is compulsory in Australia for all citizens 18 years of age or above. The Australian Electoral Commission maintains Australia's federal electoral roll. Each state also has its own electoral commission or office, but voters need to register only with the AEC, which shares the registration details with the relevant state electoral commission. =Canada= In Canada, the National Register of Electors is a continuously-updated permanent database of eligible electors for federal elections in Canada maintained by Elections Canada. In the 1990s Canada adopted an opt-in process, by which voters mark their consent to be added the national register on their annual income tax returns. The Register is also updated using the following sources: *provincial and territorial motor vehicle registrars *Canada Revenue Agency *Citizenship and Immigration Canada *provincial and territorial vital statistics registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent lists of electors (e.g. British Columbia and Quebec) *information supplied by electors when they register to vote or revise their information during and between federal electoral events *proven electoral lists from other Canadian jurisdictions Same-day registration is also permitted. =Chile= Since 2012, voter registration in Chile is automatic. It is based on a database by the Civil Registry Office of Chileans and resident foreigners in possession of an identity card number, which is unique for each individual when issues and is never re-used after a person's death. All Chileans and eligible foreigners are added automatically to the electoral roll at age 17 and placed on an electoral constituency based on their last reported address with the Office. That address, known as \\"electoral domicile,\\" can be different from a person's living address, if so desired. The electoral roll may contain a substantial number of persons residing abroad. Residents abroad are not allowed to vote in Chilean elections. =Czech Republic= All citizens and residents are included in the national register. Each person is assigned a personal identification number that includes the person's date of birth and is divisible by 11. =Denmark= All citizens and residents of Denmark are included in the national register, Det Centrale Personregister. Each person is assigned a personal number of ten digits, which include the person's date of birth. The register is used for tax lists, voter lists, membership in the universal health care system, official record of residence, and other purposes. All eligible voters receive a card in the mail before each election which shows the date, time and local polling place; it may only be presented at the designated local polling station. Only citizens may vote in national elections, while long-time residents may vote in local and regional elections. Permanent address within Denmark is required in order to vote. Voting is voluntary. =Finland= Voter registration in Finland is automatic and based on the national population register. Each citizen is assigned an identification number at birth. Permanent residents are recorded in this register even if they are not citizens, and their citizenship status is indicated in the register. People in the register are legally obliged to notify the register keeper of changes of address. Changing the address in the register automatically notifies all other public bodies (for example the tax district for local taxation, the social security authorities, the conscription authorities) and certain trusted private ones (e.g. banks and insurance companies), making the process of moving residence very simple. Close to election time, the government mails a notification to registered persons informing them of the election and where and when to cast their votes. Only citizens may vote in national elections, but all residents may vote in local elections. =Germany= In Germany, there is no separate voter registration, as resident registration is compulsory. All permanent residents of Germany are required to register their place of residence (or the fact that they are homeless) with local government. Citizens who will be 18 or older on the day of voting automatically receive a notification card in the mail some weeks before any election in which they are eligible to vote: for local elections, resident citizens of other EU countries will also receive these cards and may vote. Polling places have lists of all eligible voters resident in the neighborhood served by the particular station; the voter's notification card (or photo ID such as an identity card or passport if the notification card is not at hand) is checked against these lists before individuals receive a ballot. Voting is not compulsory. =Hong Kong= In Hong Kong all permanent residents who are above 18 years of age and do not suffer from a mental illness can register as voters. Imprisoned people can also register and vote since the laws prohibiting them from voting was ruled unconstitutional in 2009 and are able to vote since mid-2010 as the electoral roll is updated annually. The registration process is voluntary. In 2002 around 1.6 million permanent residents did not register. =Iceland= All citizens of Iceland are registered in a central database at birth, which is maintained by Registers Iceland. They do not need to register separately to vote. =India= The Government of India conducts a revision of the voters list every 5 years. An additional summary revision is conducted every year. Apart from this, citizens can request their inclusion in the voters list by applying through Form 6. If the application is valid, the applicant's name will get included in the list. At 18 years old, completed person should be eligible for voter list (for Indian citizens only). =Israel= In Israel, all citizens who are 18 years of age or older on election day are automatically registered to vote.Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \\"FAQ: Elections in Israel.\\" Retrieved 20 January 2016. =Italy= In Italy, all municipalities have a registry of residents and a registry of eligible voters. This is revised every six months and whenever there is an election. The registry of eligible voters can be viewed by anyone to ensure maximum transparency in the electoral process.Making electoral operations public ( ... ) gives a supervisory role and participation to the candidate, the party representatives and, albeit in a milder form, the same voters: All citizens aged 18 or more on the election day are automatically registered to vote. =Mexico= Voter ID card from Mexico. Mexico has a general electoral census. Any citizen of age 18 or greater must go to an electoral office in order be registered into the electoral census. Citizens receive a voting card (credencial de elector con fotograf√≠a), issued by the National Electoral Institute (INE) (from 1990 until 4/2014 it was called Federal Electoral Institute) that must be shown to vote in any election. The voting card also serves as a national identity document. =Netherlands= No separate voter registration: all eligible voters receive an invitation with a poll card using the national Civil registration (Basic Registry of Persons). Voters must present a valid ID that has not expired for more than 5 years at the polling station.Dutch election board: elections of the house of representatives Eligibility varies depending on the type of election. For national and provincial elections, only Dutch civilians are permitted to vote, while for European Parliament elections one has to have the nationality of an EU member state.Dutch Election board: elections of the European Parliament In municipal elections, eligibility is dependent on the place of residency on nomination day, with non-EU nationals also having voting rights when they have been living in the Netherlands legally for five years or more.Dutch Election board: elections of municipal council =Norway= There is no separate voter registration: All eligible voters can automatically vote. Citizens and residents of Norway are included in the national register, Folkeregisteret, where each person is assigned a personal number of eleven digits which include the person's date of birth. The register is used for tax lists, voter lists, membership in the universal health care system and other purposes, and it is maintained by the tax authorities. All eligible voters receive a card in the mail before each election which shows the date, time and local polling place. Only citizens may vote in national elections, while longtime residents may vote in local and regional elections. Voting is not compulsory.Valgloven ¬ß2, (Norwegian.) \\"Stemmerett\\" means right to vote while \\"stemmeplikt\\" means that voting is compulsory. =Peru= All citizens of Peru between 18 and 70 years are registered to vote through the National Registry of Identification and Civil Status, except all members of the police and the armed forces, who are not allowed to participate in elections. For all citizens in the country and abroad voting is mandatory, unless legally exempted. Failing to vote in the election of 7 Oct 2018 was fined with S/ 83, with 50% or 75% discount for areas with poverty or extreme poverty, and this must be paid to get access to many public services.Peru: voting is obligatory =Philippines= =South Korea= There is no formal process for voter registration for South Korean citizens. All citizens will be automatically listed in the voters' list upon each election date. A domestic in-absentee vote was ceased and citizens can visit any residents' center (Ï£ºÎØºÏÑºÌÑ∞) and vote in advance during the weekend before the actual election date. However, citizens either temporary visiting or permanently residing abroad must register for an overseas in-absentee ballot in order to vote. Voting can be done in Korean overseas missions. =Spain= No registration is required: all Spanish citizens of voting age are listed in the electoral roll through the National Statistics Institute's Electoral Census Office. Only citizens may vote in national and regional elections, while foreign residents may vote in local elections upon a reciprocity basis. Citizens from other European Union countries may also vote in European elections. Certain convicted felons are disenfranchised while serving their sentences, but their voting rights are automatically restored afterwards without exception. Most prisoners are not disenfranchised and can vote by mail as absentees. All eligible voters receive a letter in the mail to their registered address prior to election Sunday showing the date, time and local polling place, which is almost invariably the nearest school or the town hall in very small towns without a school. Polling may also be done at a Spanish diplomatic mission if residing overseas. All absentee and early voting ballots are sent physically to the registered local polling station for counting and double checking the voter's identity with the electoral roll eliminating any risk of double voting. Government-issued ID is required to vote. Voting is not compulsory.http://www.juntaelectoralcentral.es/cs/jec/informacion/enlaces/Electores =Sweden= Voter registration in Sweden is automatic and based on the national population register, Folkbokf√∂ringsregistret, administered by the Swedish Tax Agency, where all citizens and residents of Sweden are included. Each person is assigned a ten digit national identification number, which include the person's date of birth. The register is used for tax lists, voter lists, membership in the universal health care system, public insurance, official record of residence, and other purposes. Permanent residents shall be recorded in this register even if they are not citizens but enjoy right of residence, and their citizenship status is indicated in the register. Changing the address in the central register automatically notifies all other public bodies (for example the tax district for local taxation, the social security authorities, the conscription authorities) and certain trusted private ones (e.g. banks and insurance companies), making the administration of a move of residence very simple. All eligible voters receive a letter in the mail to their registered address of 30 days prior to election day, in Sweden or abroad, which shows the date, time and local polling place, always on a Sunday, normally in September each 4 years. Polling may also be done anywhere in the country at various early voting stations determined by the local Election Committee or at a Swedish Diplomatic mission, all to facilitate for the voters. To vote in person a recognized photo identity document is required, or a confirmation by someone with proper identification. The voting card letter is not compulsory to bring as it is possible to print a copy of it, but it reduces waiting time. For people with difficulties to move, like elderly, hospitalized or imprisoned, there are ambulant voting stations and the possibility to vote as an absentee through a proxy, that can be a family member, caretaker, prison guard or other person in a normal relationship with the voter. Those living on the country-side can vote with their postman and those staying abroad are allowed to vote through mail with the material provided by a diplomatic mission. Elections through Internet are not yet implemented, although most other registry related services are available, like leaving a tax return. The Local Election Committee, that manages the electoral roll and oversees safe vote counting and reporting, is appointed by each County Administrative Board and all work is transparent, as Swedish authorities by default must follow the principle of transparency, but the actual vote of each individual is kept secret. All absentee and early voting ballots are sent physically to the registered local polling station for counting and double checking the voter's identity with the electoral roll eliminating any risk of double voting. Only Swedish citizens being 18 years old on the election day and living in Sweden may vote in all public elections. Registered residents may vote in local and regional elections. Swedish citizens that are resident abroad have the right to vote in Riksdag and EU elections only. To maintain a record in the electoral roll as an expatriate, one needs to refresh the registration within 10 years; a vote counts as a valid refresh. In the elections for political members of the Church Board (Parochial church council), similar elections are held, but only members of the Church of Sweden above 16 years of age have suffrage. Universal egalitarian voting rights are protected by the constitution; all voting is voluntary and free of charge, but often seen as a duty, with voter turnout between 80 and 90% in the last decades. It is possible to change an early vote, on the election day, thus scrapping a previously sent vote. By Swedish law, the elections are direct and proportional, which means that the actual votes are reflected in each party's share of the 349 of representatives in the Riksdag, but each individual enter according to amount of personal votes. Any mismatch between districts that could skew the proportion is managed through the Leveling seats, rendering no votes powerless if placed on a party that can enter the parliament. The eligibility to the governing bodies follow the same limitations as for the voting. Through the use of blank (1,09% in 2010 Parliament elections) and unlocked ballots to allow total democracy and voting for unregistered parties, people that were not even running for office have been elected to municipal boards when their name has been handwritten on ballots raising controversy, thus the rules are being changed to disqualify ballots for a person that does not approve or is disapproved by the party.The Swedish electoral system =Switzerland= =Taiwan= All citizens of Taiwan are registered in a national database at birth, which is maintained by the Household Registration Office and the Central Election Commission of Taiwan. Taiwanese citizens do not need to register separately to vote, whereas all citizens above twenty years old will be automatically informed by postal mail from the government few weeks before every public election. =United Kingdom= In the UK voter registration is compulsory, but the requirement to register is rarely enforced. The current system of registration in the United Kingdom (UK), introduced by the Labour government, is known as rolling registration. Electors can register with a local authority at any time of the year. This replaced the twice-yearly census of electors, which often disenfranchised those who had moved during the interval between censuses. Across the country, the registration of electors is still technically the responsibility of the head of household, a concept which some consider to be anachronistic in modern society. This current system is controversial, as it is possible for one person to delete persons who live with them from the electoral roll. As of January 2012, mandatory individual registration, pursuant to the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009, was anticipated. A feasibility study for electronic individual voter registration (IVR), based on the experience of other nations, was undertaken by EURIM (Information Society Alliance) in 2010. The final report was released in 2011. According to the House of Commons Hansard from 16 January 2012, the IVR initiative is yet to be implemented in the UK. There was discussion of data from Northern Ireland, where individual voter registration levels significantly decreased following the introduction of an IVR policy. In an experiment in Northern Ireland using personal identifiers, such as National Insurance numbers and signatures, the number of registered electors fell by some ten thousand. It was also understood that the new process may have resulted in fictitious voters being dropped from rolls. Registration is mandatory pursuant to section 23 of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 (No. 341) and violators are liable on summary conviction and face a maximum fine of ¬£1,000. Voters must be on the electoral roll in order to vote in national, local or European elections. A fixed address is required in order for an individual to vote in an election. To provide for persons who are transient, if an individual lacking a fixed address wants to vote, they may register by filling in a 'Declaration of local connection' form. This establishes a connection to the area based on the last fixed address someone had, or the place where they spend a substantial amount of their time (e.g. a homeless shelter). A voting card is sent to each registrant shortly before any elections. The individual does not need to take the card to the polling station, instead it serves to remind individuals of the details they had provided to the electoral register. =United States= A group of African- American children gather around a sign and booth to register voters. Early 1960s. Sumter County Voter Information Card. In the United States, states generally require voter registration, with North Dakota being the only state which has no registration requirement. Some U.S. states do not require advance registration, instead allowing voters to register when they arrive at the polls, in what is called same day registration (SDR) or election day registration (EDR). Same-day registration (SDR) has been linked to higher voter turn-out, with SDR states reporting average turn-out of 71% in the 2012 United States Presidential election, well above the average voter turn-out rate of 59% for non-SDR states. Voter registration in the United States takes place at the county level, and is a prerequisite to voting at federal, state and local elections. The only exception is North Dakota, although North Dakota law allows cities to register voters for city elections. A 2012 study by The Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that 24% of the voting-eligible population in the United States are not registered to vote, a percentage that represents \\"at least 51 million eligible U.S. citizens.\\" Numerous states had a history of creating barriers to voter registration through a variety of fees, literacy or comprehension tests, and record-keeping requirements that in practice discriminated against racial or ethnic minorities, language minorities, and other groups. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 forbade such abuses and authorized federal oversight in jurisdictions of historic under-representation of certain groups. States continue to develop new practices that may discriminate against certain populations. By August 2016, federal rulings in five cases have overturned all or parts of voter registration or voter ID laws in Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and North Dakota that were found to place undue burden on minorities and other groups among voters.Ariane de Vogue, \\"Voting challenges head toward the Supreme Court: 4 cases to watch\\" , CNN, 19 July 2016; accessed 30 July 2016\\"Voter ID Laws Take a Beating in U.S. Courts\\", New York Times, 30 July 2016, p. 1 The states are required to offer alternatives for the November 2016 elections; many of these cases are expected to reach the US Supreme Court for additional hearings. While voters traditionally had to register at government offices by a certain period before an election, in the mid-1990s, the federal government made efforts to simplify registration procedures to improve access and increase turnout. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the \\"Motor Voter\\" law) required state governments to either provide uniform opt-in registration services through drivers' license registration centers, disability centers, schools, libraries, and mail-in registration, or to allow voter registration on Election Day, where voters can register at polling places immediately prior to voting. From 1 January 2016, Oregon was the first state to adopt a fully automatic (opt-out) voter registration system as part of the process of issuing driver licenses and ID cards. By April 2016 three more states - California, West Virginia, and Vermont - followed suit, and in May 2016 Connecticut implemented it administratively rather than by legislation, bringing the number of states with automatic voter registration to five. Alaskan voters approved Measure 1 during the 8 November 2016 general election, allowing residents the ability to register to vote when applying annually for the state's Permanent Dividend Fund. Voter approval of Measure 1 made Alaska the first state to implement automatic (opt-in) voter registration via ballot initiative and the sixth state to implement automatic registration by any means including passing legislation. Several more states have drafted legislation proposing automatic registration. Political parties and other organizations sometimes hold voter registration drives, organized efforts to register groups of new voters.

It is known for its rock formations, the result of sedimentary layering and later seismic uplift. It is located in the town of Agua Dulce, between the suburbs of Santa Clarita and Palmdale. The area is also visible from the Antelope Valley Freeway (State Route 14). It has been used as a location for films and television programs on many occasions. History These rock formations were formed by rapid erosion during uplift about 25 million years ago, and then later exposed by uplift activity along the San Andreas Fault. The Tataviam people were living here when the Spanish arrived. Their language was most likely a Takic Uto-Aztecan language. They lived in grass huts within villages. With the coming of the Spanish missions, some of these people were forced to work there. They eventually began speaking Spanish and inter-marrying with other tribes. The last of the Tataviam people died in 1916.\\"The Tataviam at Vasquez Rocks,\\" handout of County of Los Angeles Department of Parks & Recreation, Vasquez Rocks Natural Area. In 1874, Tiburcio V√°squez, one of California's most notorious bandits, used these rocks to elude capture by law enforcement. His name has since been associated with this geologic feature. The land and rock formations were acquired gradually by Los Angeles County, beginning with a donation of 40 acres in 1971, with more parcels being added through 2001. The Pacific Crest Trail crosses through the park. Vasquez Rocks was added to the National Register of Historic Places (site #72000228) in 1972 because of its significance as a prehistoric site for the Shoshone and Tataviam peoples. Formation Literature reviews have dated the earliest sedimentation of the Vasquez Formation occurring between the later portion of the Oligocene Epoch to the lower Miocene Epoch, each respectively 33.9-23 million years ago and 23.03-5.3 million years ago. The Vasquez Formation is located just east of the city of Santa Clarita, Los Angeles County, California, USA. It resides within the Soledad Basin, an orthogonal rift between the Sierra Pelona Mountains to the northwest and the San Gabriel Mountains to the east, which are both within the province of the Transverse Mountain Range of Southern California. The San Andreas Fault runs parallel behind the Sierra Pelona Mountains and separates the formation from the North American Plate. The Vasquez Formation consists of alluvial sediments that eroded from the Sierra Pelona and San Gabriel Mountains and were deposited in alluvial fans on both sides of the Soledad Basin. Erosion of the sediment included processes like rain, floods, wind, and earthquakes. Over the course of millions of years, the sediment was laid down under alternating lacustrine and fluviatile conditions. Once laid flat across the basin floor, immense pressure converted the layers into sandstone, which became covered with younger sediment deposits. The sediment beds reside in a sharply-folded syncline. Due to its proximity to the San Andreas Fault, tectonic activity has been an important factor in the reshaping, uplift, and exposure of the buried sandstone. The Elkhorn Fault, an offshoot of the San Andreas Fault, runs through the Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park. Other faults, such as the Pelona, Vasquez Canyon, Soledad, and San Gabriel Faults, are all within proximity of the formation. The most exposed portion of the Vasquez Formation is the oldest tertiary formation within the east portion of the Ventura Basin. The Vasquez Rocks consist mainly of coarse-grained conglomerate and breccia sediments, which were deposited adjacent to active faults during rapid uplift and consequent erosion of the San Gabriel Mountains. Approximately 25 million years ago (late Oligocene time), the collision of the North American and Pacific tectonic plates uplifted the area along the Elkhorn Fault. Energetic erosion of the highland along with uplift and volcanism caused debris flow sediments to be distributed in alluvial fans into a rapidly subsiding rift known as the Soledad Basin. These sediments were buried and lithified through the Miocene and became exposed more recently via activity along the San Andreas fault system. The strata are now highly tilted and disconnected from their source area. The strata were deformed and offset by the later fault activity. The distinctive hogback ridges of steeply inclined strata serve to graphically demonstrate the significant fault activity in the area. It is possible to see the extreme variance in grain size between layers of sediment where the strata are exposed. These sedimentary rocks, named the Mint Canyon Formation, were laid down about 8-15 million years ago. In the upper layers, many animal fossils have been found, including camels, horses and rodents.\\"Geology Trail,\\" handout of County of Los Angeles Department of Parks & Recreation, Vasquez Rocks Natural Area. Soil surveyors mapped much of the park as Rock Land with no soil cover; where soil exists the dominant series is Gaviota gravelly loam which ranges from 6 to 20 inches thick.https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/ SoilWeb: An Online Soil Survey Browser California Soil Resource Lab Role in entertainment Universal Studios assigned Stanley Bergerman as executive producer on the film Werewolf of London (1935). Bergerman suggested Vasquez Rocks as the filming location used to portray Tibet. The prominent rock formation was featured in several episodes of the original Star Trek series. It recurred in the franchise later in the film Star Trek V: The Final Frontier and an episode of Star Trek: Picard, in a scene identified as taking place at that real location, and on other occasions. Feature films shot at Vasquez Rocks include Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, Dante's Peak, Hot Shots! Part Deux, Rustlers' Rhapsody, The Flintstones, Blazing Saddles, Free Enterprise, Paul, and Hail, Caesar!. Television shows include Zorro, The Fugitive, F Troop, The A-Team, MacGyver and G.L.O.W.. Commercials for Taco Bell, Bank of America, Pacific Bell, Pepsi, and Nike have been filmed at the rocks. Musicians Radiohead, Michael Jackson, Greta Van Fleet, 311, Eddie Money, Sammy Kershaw, Restless Heart, Lee Tae-min, and BTS have made music videos there.Cook, Tari, \\"Filming in Agua Dulce,\\" The 1997 Agua Dulce Chamber of Commerce Business & Community Guide.

The character is based on a god in Greek mythology. Publication history The comic version of Zeus is based on the god of the same name from Greek mythology. Zeus first appears in Venus #5 (June 1949), and was adapted by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Zeus is the youngest son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, the children of sky god Ouranos and elder goddess Gaea (also known as \\"Mother Earth\\"). His father Cronus rose to power in the dimension which later became known as Olympus, after fatally wounding his own father Ouranos. As he lay dying, Ouranos prophesied that one of the children of Cronus would overthrow him in turn, so Cronus ate each of his children as they were born. His wife Rhea hid Zeus, their sixth child, on Mount Lycaeum in Arcadia, and tricked Cronos into eating a stone instead of the infant Zeus. There Zeus grew to adulthood and then plotted his revenge on Cronus. Zeus, out of revenge, went down to Tartarus and freed his siblings Hades, Hestia, Hera, Poseidon, and Demeter, all now grown to adulthood, as well as the three Cyclopes, and the three hundred-handed giants called Hekatoncheries, which he had also imprisoned. The Cyclopes gave the three gods their respective weapons (Zeus' thunderbolt, Poseidon's trident, and Hades' Helm of Darkness) and taught Zeus how to wield his energy-manipulating powers, and Zeus led his allies in a ten- year war against Cronus and the Titans. After winning the war, Zeus imprisoned Cronus and most of the male Titans in Tartarus. Zeus drew lots with his brothers Hades and Poseidon, and became supreme ruler of the Olympian gods, their dimension and the sky. Zeus married Hera, but engaged in many relationships with goddesses and mortal women alike, angering his jealous wife. Some of his children from these unions were gods, and joined the Olympian pantheon, while others were mortals such as Helen of Troy and the hero Hercules who eventually became a god. At some point during Zeus' rise to power, Zeus imprisoned Nyx until the day when the Sun is separated from Earth.Avengers: No Road Home #2. Marvel Comics. After the Hyborian Age, the ancient Greek civilization began to rise, so Zeus made the Olympian gods known to them to gain their worship. Zeus discovered the principal nexus between the Olympian dimension and Greece was at the top of Greece's Mount Olympus, near Olympia, the principal city of Earth's Eternals. Zeus and his daughter Athena met with Zuras, the leader of the Eternals, and his daughter Azura. Given the physical resemblance between the Eternals and Olympians, both parties formed an alliance, with the Eternals representing the gods on Earth. Zuras soon decreed that Azura become Thena. However, the humans began to think of the Eternals as the Olympian gods themselves and not merely their representatives, leading to a growing resentment by the gods towards the Eternals which eventually erupted into war for a time. Christianity eventually became the dominant religion of the Roman Empire, and Zeus decided that the Olympian gods would break most of their ties with Earth, except for Poseidon, who would continue to watch over his worshippers in Atlantis. During the war of Troy Zeus battled Thor who had accidentally been transported there. Hades deplored Zeus' decree, and challenged Zeus' supremacy many times. A millennium ago, Hercules transported a band of soldiers from ancient Greece through time to battle Norsemen who were under the protection of the Asgardian god Thor, leading to war between the Asgardians and Olympians. Zeus met secretly with the Asgardian ruler Odin, and the two elder gods put an end to the war and formed an alliance to defend Earth from the Celestials. Zeus' first depiction in modern comics shows his first meeting with Thor.

Mikaboshi also stole Alexander, the son of Ares, and brainwashed Alexander into becoming his personal God of War. In the end though, thanks to Ares' love for his son, and the power of Zeus, Alexander broke free and apparently slew Mikaboshi.

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Zeus belongs to an extra-dimensional race of extraterrestrials known both among themselves and to mortals as the Olympians, also known simply as the Greek gods, Greco-Roman gods, or the Roman gods. Zeus possesses power on a cosmic scale surpassing those of any other Olympians and is the equal of beings such as Galactus, the Celestials, the Stranger and Odin.Thanos Annual #1 (2014). Marvel Comics. Like all Olympians, Zeus has superhuman physical attributes of strength, stamina and speed, although he is stronger than the other Olympians with the exception of his demigod son Hercules. His super- speed allows him to run and fly at speeds surpassing the speed of sound and possibly reaching orbital speed, though he is not exclusively a speedster like the mutant Quicksilver or his son the Messenger God Hermes, who is considerably faster than Zeus in the same way Hercules is stronger; his stamina allows him to exert himself rigorously for hours, possibly days, without tiring. His superior Olympian super-strength allows him to stand against virtually any superpowered foe, and the full force of Zeus's magic is powerful enough to stagger Galactus; though he is neither invincible nor omnipotent, and can be defeated by older deities or by cosmic beings of above- godly power. Zeus is virtually immortal in the sense that he does not age, is immune to all known diseases and Earthly toxins, and cannot be killed through conventional means. He, like all Olympians, can regenerate at an accelerated pace and possesses some resistance to magic due to his divine, otherworldly nature and inborn resilience. Zeus possesses the ability to manipulate vast amounts of cosmic and mystical energy for a variety of purposes, including temporary augmentation of his superhuman physical abilities, firing powerful bolts of electrical force energy, changing his shape and size at will, opening and closing inter-dimensional apertures, sending himself and others through these dimensions, creating mountains, granting superhuman abilities and properties to living beings or inanimate objects, and the power to generate great amounts of electrical energy and discharge it as lightning bolts. Zeus can also control the mystical life energies of other Olympian gods, and has removed and restored much of his son Hercules' divine attributes several times in the past. Zeus possesses limited precognitive abilities that allow him to glimpse various alternate futures. Zeus is also an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having thousands of years of experience at his disposal, and is virtually invincible in hurling lightning bolts.

The series includes four games and two expansion packs. Several remakes exist.  Gameplay  The central aspects of Warlords game series are units, heroes, cities and diplomacy. = Units = Units are the expendable resource in Warlords, produced and/or purchased in all active cities. Units come in different types such as light infantry, archers, elephants, and even mythological creatures such as minotaurs and unicorns. All units in Warlords have several standard properties: strength, distance of movement per turn, cost, and upkeep. Some have additional special abilities such as fly, bonuses to defense or combat, or traverse difficult terrain without hindrances. Since the introduction of Warlords III, units also have hit points. Allies are a special type of unit only found by searching ruins or hidden temples. Allies are relatively powerful compared to regular units, don't require upkeep, and often include one or more special abilities. Allies include units such as wizards, dragons, devils, and archons (angels). Some versions of the game, such as Warlords II, have an option to allow cities to produce allies like regular units. In this case, the allies require upkeep and have a production cost. = Heroes = Heroes are a special type of unit with a unique set of properties and special abilities: * Possess items - Heroes may pick up items found in ruins or in hidden tombs. These items increase your hero's or his stack combat abilities, player income, or the ability to cast spells (Warlords III); * Search ruins and hidden tombs - Heroes may search ruins and hidden tombs to fight a special enemy unit. If successful, the hero is rewarded with money, items, or allies; * Receive and complete a quest - A hero may receive a quest from a temple, whereupon completion results in a reward of money, items, or allies. Only one hero at a time may be on a quest; * Cast spells - Starting with Warlords III, heroes may gain the ability to cast spells. * Experience Points - Heroes are the only units to gain experience points by killing enemy units, conquering cities, and completing quests. More experience results in higher levels, up to a maximum of level 5 (except in Warlords 4) increasing the unit's combat abilities and movement per level. Within Warlords 4 you may keep 3 units from each battle as a personal retinue, this creates a replayability within the game and allows you to obtain very high levels with each of the units you hold in your retinue (waaaay above level 5). Each player begins play with a level 1 hero at the start of the game. Unlike other units, additional heroes can not be produced by cities or discovered in ruins or hidden tombs. The only way to gain a new hero is to accept an offer in exchange for money. Newly hired heroes often come with allies. Heroes have the potential to be the most powerful unit in the game. = Cities = The game flow of Warlords typically involves capturing the cities. The default winning condition is to conquer most of the cities on the map. The cities are the main source of new units in the game. Up to four different units can be available in a single city with an ability for player to buy production ‚Äî to replace the currently available units with others at some initial cost. Once the player owning the city orders production of unit, the city will provide new units of a kind until another order is issued. The production may be forwarded from one city to another, allowing player to concentrate armies on the borderline or in another location of strategic interest. The cities also serve the defense purpose: the defenders of city enjoy the \\"city bonus\\", which increases armies' strength. Several units have the special ability to cancel the city bonus. Once a city falls to another player, he or she has a choice whether to occupy, pillage, sack or raze it. Once razed, the city can't be rebuilt. Sacking the city removes all the production options returning the player half of their cost. Pillaging the city results in removal of some production options (those being the most expensive units in Warlords and Warlords II, and the units a player can't produce in Warlords III). = Diplomacy = The relations between the players are regulated by the diplomacy: the players should declare wars before actually engaging their armies in battles. While there is a possibility to attack another player without prior negotiations, such behavior may be followed by unilateral declaration of war by all other players on a violator. = Battles = The battles in Warlords (with the exception of Warlords IV) are non-interactive. The process of battle is shown as two enemy stacks opposing each other; when a unit is killed it disappears from the battle screen. The outcome of the battle is calculated using the units' abilities and several other factors using a sophisticated algorithm.  Original series  The games of the series are noted for the strong AI. The games are set in the fantasy world of Etheria, and tend to be based around the traditional premise of good versus evil, with neutrality in between. Heroes on the side of good are the Sirian Knights, the mercantile Empires of Men, the elves and the dwarves. On the side of evil are the demonic horsemen: the Lord of Plague, the Lord of Famine, the Lord of War, and the ever present Lord Bane, Lord of Death. The politics of the world, however, are more complicated than they first appear, particularly in the third installment of the series. For example, the Minotaurs, who were created as servants for Sartek, the Lord of War, are a neutral race rather than an evil one. Also, the third game opens with the human Empire pillaging and exploiting the newly discovered lands of the peaceful Srrathi snakemen, in an obvious nod to the historical European conquest of the Americas. Most importantly from a player's point of view, a Hero's race is not as important in determining his or her moral alignment as is his or her choice of class. For example, while the Undead are evil as a rule, an Undead Paladin would be treated as good (though such a thing is only possible in the third game, wherein all previous restrictions on race and class combinations have been removed). = Warlords = The first game in the series, Warlords, was created in 1990 by Steven Fawkner and was published by SSG. It featured eight different clans battling for the control of the mythical land of Illuria: Sirians, Storm Giants, Grey Dwarves, Orcs of Kor, Elvallie, Horse Lords, Selentines, and Lord Bane. Each clan could either be controlled by the computer or by a human player, allowing up to eight participants taking turns in hot seat play. Gameplay consisted of moving units, attacking opponent units or cities, adjusting production in cities, and moving hero units to explore ruins, temples, libraries, and to discover allies, relics, and other items. The goal of the game was to conquer the land of Illuria by capturing or razing at least two thirds of the cities in the land. = Warlords II = Following the success of Warlords, SSG released Warlords II in 1993. This version included five maps (although the later released mission pack increased the number). Another new feature was 'fog of war' - optionally, enemy units or even the map could be concealed from players without units close enough to see them. The interface of the game was improved, as were the graphics (with additional unique city graphics for each different player). Moreover, the game featured multiple army, city, and terrain sets (still in 16 colours), play by e-mail as well as hot seat, and a random map generator and map editor. The updated version of the game ‚Äî Warlords II Deluxe ‚Äî was released in 1995. It allowed for custom tile, army and city sets for maps and provided support for 256 colours. Thanks to the publication of the editor, Warlords II Deluxe led to an increase of user- created content. Many new maps, army and terrain sets, and scenarios were distributed on the Internet for the game. = Warlords III = After a four- year hiatus, SSG developed Warlords III: Reign of Heroes. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and used new system capabilities to dramatically improve graphics: * animated armies' movements * skinnable user interface * several landscape options * more advanced city graphics The heroes acquired the ability to cast spells to receive the temporary benefit. Each spell has its price expressed in mana points, which became the second (after gold) resource in game. The campaign system also became more advanced: the heroes from the previous game of the campaign followed the user to the new game, keeping their experience and items. The concept of diplomacy was further refined by adding new state of diplomatic relations: Treaty. This state allowed players trespassing each other's cities and winning the Allied victory exterminating all other parties. Another diplomacy-related feature introduced in Reign of Heroes was the ability to bribe enemies, thus influencing their diplomatic decisions. The amount of bribe was fine-tunable; the more substantial bribe was, the greater chances of needed decision were. In addition to the previously available multiplayer modes (hotseat and play by email) the Reign of Heroes introduced the ability to play over network. Shortly after releasing Reign of Heroes, SSG followed with Warlords III: Darklords Rising ‚Äî a stand-alone expansion pack. It featured the new maps and units and contained the sample graphics to facilitate development of alternative tile, army and city sets. The plot of the main campaign continued where the previous game had left off. Warlords III like Warlords II had a campaign editor and realistic terrain model. By the time of Warlords III games' releases the real-time strategy game genre was in full-swing, so there was less of a market for turn-based games. The oncoming rush of first person shooters and first generation MMORPGs also didn't help the popularity of the series. The turn-based strategy genre in general would take a hit during this period. = Warlords IV = Warlords IV, released in 2003, used pre-rendered 3D sprites for its unit and city graphics and particle graphics for various effects. Despite this, the game had an overall 2D look to it. The game flow was dramatically simplified. Diplomacy played virtually no role in the game, and micromanagement of units was scaled-down to a great extent. Rather than having multiple units battling it out at once, combat is one-on-one: the players could choose which units they wished to send into battle, one after another in the stack. The units with ranged attack capabilities get involved in every round in the battle regardless of active unit though. In warfare, the cities no longer added a fixed amount to the fighting values of the defenders, but rather fired random archery shots between the defenders' strikes. Although heroes were still obtainable in the usual way, it was now possible to routinely produce them in the top level castles as well. The city upgrades became more important, as the level of city determines the range of units it can produce. The races in game became predefined: knights, empire, elves, dark elves, dwarves, dragons, undead, demons, orcs and ogres. Each of these races had its traits, giving it advantages and disadvantages regarding the race of the opposing player. Each player had a certain favored race, and the pace of production of units belonging to other races depended on the interracial relations. The player's character in this game was personified as a special unit which only involved in battles over capital city and couldn't move around the map. The defeat of the warlord led to defeat of the player, so that all his cities became neutral. Depending on the traits the player picked at the time of warlord creation, he got some benefits and limitations in the game. The warlord character could be reused in other campaigns.  Spin-offs  = Battlecry series = Warlords Battlecry is a real-time strategy computer game released in July 2000 for Microsoft Windows. Two sequels were released: Warlords Battlecry II in 2002 and Warlords Battlecry III in 2004. = Puzzle Quest series = Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords is a puzzle game based on the Warlords universe released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. The game spawned several sequels.  Remakes  = Warlords II for Windows Mobile = On 27 October 2003 Pocket PC Studios released a Windows Mobile clone of Warlords II. The game featured the graphics and gameplay of the Warlords II for DOS with the slight user interface changes (related to devices' capabilities) and 200 pages of manual in Microsoft Reader format. Unlike the original game the remake featured several multiple language support with several localizations available. = Warlords Classic = On 26 October 2010 ALSEDI Group released Warlords Classic, a remake of the original Warlords game for iPhone. The remake preserved most of the game traits with only some subtle changes: the user interface of the game was adapted to iPhone and the game is saved automatically after each turn. On 10 June 2012 ALSEDI Group also released \\"Warlords Classic\\", a more accurate port of original game for iPhone and iPad. This version implements artifacts, production vectoring and more powerful AI. = FreeLords = FreeLords intends to be a turn-based strategy game like the original Warlords. It is early in development and the game is unplayable. = LordsAWar! = The abandoned C++ code base of FreeLords was taken over by Ben Asselstine, who named his project LordsAWar!. The goal was set to reimplement Warlords II as close as possible. The development began with removal of features not found in the original game. Identification and implementation of missing Warlords II functionality followed. As of October 2011 the game is playable locally and mostly feature complete, but network play is still broken. = Warbarons = Warbarons can be played for free within a web-browser. Being web-based makes it easier to find human opponents to play with. Development was started in 2009 by Mattias Carlstrom and Jonte Rydberg, initially not intended to be a Warlords clone. However, with help from members of the Warlords' player community, the game developed many striking similarities: map with square tiles, stacks of up to 8 units, the entire combat system, ruins, cities, temples, heroes, allies, etc. Notable differences to Warlords are: the level system for heroes (similar to Warlords III, but differing skills and classes); the absence of hero quests (sages just improve hero abilities) and that ships for water movement are not built, but instantly bought instead. As of September 2020, Warbarons is fully playable online and still actively maintained and improved by its original developers.

Its occurrence on Hoste Island has previously earned it the distinction of being the southernmost tree on earth, however in 2019 it was established that N. betuloides was found further south on Hornos Island. N. antarctica is present on Hornos as well, but the southernmost individual is slightly further north (17m) of the southernmost N. betuloides. Description Foliage Nothofagus antarctica typically grows 10‚Äì25 m (32‚Äì80 ft) tall and has a slender trunk with scaly bark. The leaves are simple and alternate, growing 2-4.5 cm long, and often viscid, with a sweetly scented wax. The leaf color is medium green, turning yellow to orange in the fall. The leaves are broadly ovate to triangular, crinkly, rounded at the tips, irregularly and minutely toothed. The flowers are inconspicuous yellow-green catkins. The fruit is a 6 mm, very fragrant 4-valved capsule containing three small nuts. Cultivation N. antarctica has been planted on the North Pacific Coast of the United States and in Great Britain where it thrives.

(18 October 1873 - 20 April 1951) was an Italian statesman before and after World War II and ruled Italy as the 25th Prime Minister of Italy. Bonomi was born in Mantua, Italy. He was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1909, representing Mantua as a member of the Italian Socialist Party. He was among those expelled from the party in 1912, for his advocacy of reformism and moderation, as well as his support for the Italian invasion of Libya. Bonomi joined the Italian Reformist Socialist Party, and supported Italy's participation in World War I on the side of the Triple Entente. Bonomi served as Minister of Public Works from 1916 until 1917, and as Minister of War from 1920 until 1921 - helping to negotiate a treaty with Yugoslavia (the Treaty of Rapallo). Later in 1921 he became Treasury Minister. A few months later, he became Prime Minister of Italy for the first time, in a coalition government‚Äîthe first socialist to hold the post. Early in 1922, his government collapsed, and he was replaced as Prime Minister by Luigi Facta, amidst the Fascist insurgency led by Benito Mussolini. In October 1922, Mussolini gained power through the March on Rome, and Bonomi withdrew from politics. In 1940, Bonomi joined an anti-Fascist movement. By 1943, when Mussolini was deposed, Bonomi had become a leader of the group. In June 1944, when Rome was taken by the Allies, he replaced Badoglio as Prime Minister of the new Italian government. He led Italy as the country was being gained from the Fascist Italian Social Republic and the Nazi German occupiers, and helped the country's transition to democracy. Numerous reforms in social security were made during Bonomi's time as prime minister.

The novel includes some characters who cross over from Rice's Lives of the Mayfair Witches trilogy (1990‚Äì1994), continuing the unified story begun in Merrick (2000). Plot summary Tarquin \\"Quinn\\" Blackwood, heir to a powerful old family in New Orleans, has been plagued by a mysterious spirit named Goblin for his entire life. Made a vampire in his youth, Quinn seeks out Lestat de Lioncourt looking for help in getting rid of Goblin, who has become more and more malevolent. Quinn recalls his youth, his family, and his forced transformation into a vampire by Petronia. His stories allow Lestat to better understand the reach and power of Goblin, and clue in Lestat to the fact that Quinn is connected to the Mayfair family of witches. After his own failure defeating Goblin, Lestat asks the witch Merrick Mayfair, also a vampire, for assistance. Meanwhile, Quinn has fallen in love with heiress Mona Mayfair, and the ghost of their mutual ancestor Julien Mayfair warns him against making Mona a vampire. Goblin is revealed to be the spirit of Quinn's twin Gawain, who died days after being born. He is bound to Quinn, and is relentlessly jealous to experience whatever Quinn does. Merrick performs a ritual using Gawain's corpse to exorcise Goblin. She sacrifices herself by carrying the child's spirit into the hereafter with her, and Lestat is heartbroken. Crossovers Some characters from Rice's Lives of the Mayfair Witches trilogy (1990‚Äì1994) appear in Merrick (2000), and later Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle (2003). Audiobooks In 2002, Penguin Random House Audio released an abridged audiobook adaptation of Blackwood Farm, narrated by Stephen Spinella, as well as an unabridged version, narrated by David Pittu. Critical reception Blackwood Farm debuted at No. 4 on The New York Times Best Seller list, spending a total of five weeks on the list. Publishers Weekly wrote that the novel contains plenty of \\"intrigue, eroticism and obsession\\", adding that \\"Rice fleshes out her slim plot line with gory set pieces of vampire history in ancient Athens, Pompeii and 19th century Naples. She excels at vivid descriptions of macabre landscapes, gloomy estate houses and the lust that motivates her Blood Hunters and propels her ghoulish narratives. Her dialogue and characterizations, however‚Äîeven of the durable Vampire Lestat‚Äîare flat and predictable here.\\" Reviewing the audiobook adaptation, AudioFile wrote, \\"Fraught with swamps, witches, cemeteries, forbidden love, and blood lust, all knotted up with family honor, this steamy potboiler is perfect for the 'vampirophile.'\\" References The Vampire Chronicles novels Novels by Anne Rice American horror novels 2002 American novels Alfred A.

The immediate subject of their meeting was to consider whether they should give battle to an enemy that lay encamped on the shore beneath them; but on the result of their deliberations depended, not merely the fate of two armies, but the whole future progress of human civilization.\\" # Defeat of the Athenians at Syracuse, 413 BC #* Known as the Battle of Syracuse. #* Excerpt: \\"Few cities have undergone more memorable sieges during ancient and medieval times than has the city of Syracuse.\\" # The Battle of Gaugamela, 331 BC #* Also called the Battle of Arbela. #* Excerpt: \\"the ancient Persian empire, which once subjugated all the nations of the earth, was defeated when Alexander had won his victory at Arbela.\\" # The Battle of the Metaurus, 207 BC #* Excerpt: \\"That battle was the determining crisis of the contest, not merely between Rome and Carthage, but between the two great families of the world...\\" # Victory of Arminius over the Roman Legions under Varus, AD 9 #* Known as the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. #* Excerpt: \\"that victory secured at once and forever the independence of the Teutonic race.\\" # The Battle of Ch√¢lons, AD 451 #* Also called the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields or the Battle of the Catalun. #* Excerpt: \\"The victory which the Roman general, A√´tius, with his Gothic allies, had then gained over the Huns, was the last victory of imperial Rome.\\" # The Battle of Tours, AD 732 #* Also called the Battle of Poitiers. #* Excerpt: \\"the great victory won by Charles Martel ... gave a decisive check to the career of Arab conquest in Western Europe.\\" # The Battle of Hastings, AD 1066 #* Excerpt: \\"no one who appreciates the influence of England and her empire upon the destinies of the world will ever rank that victory as one of secondary importance.\\" # Joan of Arc's Victory over the English at Orl√©ans, AD 1429 #* Known as the Siege of Orl√©ans. #* Excerpt: \\"the struggle by which the unconscious heroine of France, in the beginning of the fifteenth century, rescued her country from becoming a second Ireland under the yoke of the triumphant English.\\" # Defeat of the Spanish Armada, AD 1588 #* Excerpt: \\"The England of our own days is so strong, and the Spain of our own days is so feeble, that it is not easy, without some reflection and care, to comprehend the full extent of the peril which England then ran from the power and the ambition of Spain, or to appreciate the importance of that crisis in the history of the world.\\" # The Battle of Blenheim, AD 1704 #* Excerpt: \\"Had it not been for Blenheim, all Europe might at this day suffer under the effect of French conquests resembling those of Alexander in extent and those of the Romans in durability.\\" # The Battle of Pultowa, AD 1709 #* Also called the Battle of Poltava. #* Excerpt: \\"The decisive triumph of Russia over Sweden at Pultowa was therefore all-important to the world, on account of what it overthrew as well as for what it established\\" # Victory of the Americans over Burgoyne at Saratoga, AD 1777 #* Excerpt: \\"The ancient Roman boasted, with reason, of the growth of Rome from humble beginnings to the greatest magnitude which the world had then ever witnessed.

In 1936 the San Jacinto Monument was given an inscription that echoed Wharton's view: \\"Measured by its results, San Jacinto was one of the decisive battles of the world. The freedom of Texas from Mexico won here led to annexation and to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, resulting in the acquisition by the United States of the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California, Utah and parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas and Oklahoma.

He listed 16 battles from Arbela to Midway. * In 1963, Robert Silverberg published 15 Battles that Changed the World and acknowledged the inspiration of Creasy's book. Silverberg's list included seven battles that Creasy had listed (Marathon, Tours, Hastings, Orleans, the Spanish Armada, Blenheim, and Waterloo) with six different battles (Zama, Actium, Adrianople, Lepanto, the Plains of Abraham, and Valcour Island) and two that had occurred after Creasy's work (Gettysburg and Stalingrad). Silverberg also acknowledged that this was a list of battles that had affected Western history and did not include battles from other parts of history. * In 1964, American historian Lt. Col. Joseph B. Mitchell published Twenty Decisive Battles of the World, an update of Creasy's list with five additions: *# The Vicksburg Campaign, 1863.

P. 2016 came into an increasing amount of criticism from the 20th century onwards in regards to several aspects.Sir Edward Creasy Revisited Showalter, D. E. 1988. _Military Affairs_. Vol 52. No 4. =Eurocentrism= The vast majority Creasy's selected battles occurred on Europe between two European powers (or in the case of the Battle of Saratoga, between two Western powers), with the battles closest to Asia being Marathon and Poltava. In addition, many of his battles feature England in some capacity, leaving a lack of balance in regards to non-European history. =Non-Decisive= Creasy's text is premised on the fact that his chosen battles were _decisive_ \\\\- that an alternate result (or the absence of the battle) would lead to the world as we know it being radically different.Concept of Decisive Battles Harari, Y. N. _Journal of World History_. Vol. 18, No. 3 (Sep., 2007), pp. 251-266 This viewpoint has been frequently criticised in the last century, with most, though not all, viewpoints disagreeing that (these) singular battles were the primary movers of society. =Vagueness= Beyond potential errors in choice or concept, Creasy is criticised for the vagueness of his descriptions, sources given and battle analysis. By World War I fully reconstructed battle movements and plans were considered the norm if true analysis was to be undertaken. The lack of context, both political and social around the battles chosen makes consideration of its various impacts either difficult or impossible.British Army in the Middle East Kitchen, J, E. 2014. There is also a focus on dramatic description or rhetoric of the battles taking precedence over analysis. Set against this however is the fact that Creasy did not specifically set out to target his works for the military or military historians - he also wrote for public readership, and was without military experience or formal training in the field.Sir Edward Creasy, 1812-1878 Charles E.

New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 2014-11-16. is the vessel used in Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, High Church Lutheran and Anglican churches for the more convenient exhibition of some object of piety, such as the consecrated Eucharistic host during Eucharistic adoration or Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. It is also used as reliquary for the public display of relics of some saints.\\"\\". New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 2014-11-16. The word monstrance comes from the Latin word monstrare,\\"Demonstrate\\", The American Heritage Dictionary, men in Appendix I, Indo-European Roots while the word ostensorium came from the Latin word ostendere. Both terms, meaning \\"to show\\", are used for vessels intended for the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, but ostensorium has only this meaning.  Liturgical context  In the Catholic tradition, at the moment of consecration the elements (called \\"gifts\\" for liturgical purposes) are transformed (literally transubstantiated) into the body and blood of Christ. Catholic doctrine holds that the elements are not only spiritually transformed, but are (substantially) transformed into the body and blood of Christ. Although the elements retain the appearance, or \\"accidents,\\" of bread and wine, they become the body and blood of Christ. The presence of Jesus in the Eucharist is known as the doctrine of the Corporeal Presence within the Roman Catholic tradition. Other Christians (notably in the Anglican Church, Old Catholic Church, and Lutheran Church) accept the doctrine of the Real Presence, whilst rejecting transubstantiation as a philosophical concept (cf. sacramental union). Owing to these beliefs, the consecrated elements are given the same adoration and devotion that Christians of these traditions accord to Christ himself. Within churches of these traditions the reserved sacrament serves as a focal point of religious devotion. In many of them, during Eucharistic adoration, the celebrant displays the sacrament in the monstrance, typically on the altar. When not being displayed, the reserved sacrament is locked in a tabernacle (more common in Roman Catholicism) or aumbry (more common in the other traditions mentioned).  Use and design  The Blessed Sacrament in a monstrance carried in a procession by a priest wearing a humeral veil Two monstrances, showing the contrast between the modern simplified design on the right with its more ornate predecessor on the left In the service of benediction, (the priest blesses the people with the Eucharist displayed in the monstrance. This blessing differs from the priest's blessing, as it is seen to be the blessing by Christ rather than that of the individual priest. The exposition of the monstrance during Benediction is traditionally accompanied by chanting or singing of the hymn Tantum Ergo. Monstrances are usually elaborate in design; most are carried by the priest. Others may be much larger fixed constructions, typically for displaying the host in a special side chapel, often called the \\"Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament\\". For portable designs, the preferred form is a sunburstInstructio Clement., 5 on a stand, usually topped by a cross. Medieval monstrances were more varied in form than contemporary ones. Those used for relics, and occasionally for the host, typically had a crystal cylinder in a golden stand, and those usually used for hosts had a crystal window in a flat-faced golden construction, which could stand on its base. The monstrance was most often made of silver-gilt or other precious metal, and highly decorated. In the center of the sunburst, the monstrance normally has a small round glass the size of a Host, through which the Blessed Sacrament can be seen. Behind this glass is a round container made of glass and gilded metal, called a lunette, which holds the Host securely in place. When not in the monstrance, the Host in its luna is placed in a special standing container, called a standing pyx, in the Tabernacle. Before the current design, earlier \\"little shrines\\" or reliquaries of various shapes and sizes were used.

It currently focuses on the girl-next-door style pornography, offering cash for any photos of \\"readers' wives\\" printed; in the past, however, several notable glamour models were featured, including minor celebrity Joanne Guest. It also includes the traditional \\"true\\" stories. There was an earlier UK men's magazine of the same title that dates from the 1930s to the late 1950s. This was a pocket format title, which featured a colour centre spread by the illustrator George Davies. Despite the market for softcore pornography decreasing in the UK, presumably due to a combination of the internet, and more extreme material being available, Razzle is still successful, having launched some spin off titles including Razzle Extreme, The Best of Razzle, Razzle Readers Wives and Razzle DVD. Razzle does however offer hardcore imagery and videos of the photosets found in its magazines online, on the official Paul Raymond website. Razzle is published by the late Paul Raymond's publishing house, whose other publications include Club International, Escort, Mayfair, Men Only and Men's World.Sigel (2005) p.164 All of the Paul Raymond magazines are widely available in newsagents, although some larger retailers require a modesty bag in order to protect minors from seeing partial nudity on display on the cover. From 2013, the magazines were also available for a few years in digital format on the Paul Raymond digital newsstand. Early Days Nicholas Whittaker, journalist and author of Platform Souls, Blue Period and Sweet Talk, worked for the company from 1982 to 1987,Sigel (2005) p.162 and played a major role in establishing the new Razzle magazine. In its first format Razzle was 48 pages and sold for 50p. He wrote of his experiences and the formation of the new magazine in Blue Period.Sigel (2005) p.166 In popular culture The earlier men's magazine (1930s‚Äì1950s) was later immortalised in the Ian Dury song Razzle In My Pocket (1977, the 'B' side to Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll), a story of a boy trying to steal a copy of said magazine from a bookshop. The song also appears on the 1981 compilation LP Juke Box Dury (side 1, track 6). Razzle is also mentioned in David Lodge‚Äôs 1970 novel Out of the Shelter. In the book, the magazine is passed from hand to hand at the protagonists's school, and its readers are annoyed that the parts they are most interested in are covered up. The Paul Raymond magazine (1983‚Äì) has been referenced in the mainstream media, with the name Razzle having been mentioned in numerous British comedy TV programmes, including Meet Ricky Gervais, Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere, and in an episode of Absolutely Fabulous where it is implied that Patsy once posed for the magazine (albeit in the early 1970s when the magazine was not actually in production).The Advocate, 20 November 2001, p.44 It is also mentioned in Men Behaving Badly and Bottom, and in Little Britain, when Lou buys the magazine for Andy.

He was a member of the True Whig Party, which ruled the country from 1878 until 1980. He served as the 17th President of Liberia from 1920 until 1930. King was Attorney General from 1904 until 1912, and Secretary of State of Liberia from 1912 until he was elected president in 1919. In this capacity, he attended the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and the accompanying First Pan-African Congress. Though a moderate supporter of reform, he continued to support the patronage machine and dominance of the True Whig Party. In 1927, he won the presidential election with over 15 times more votes than there were electors, but a forced labor and slavery scandal forced his resignation in 1930. Presidency (1920‚Äì1930) Charles D. B. King became Liberia's President in 1920 and served for 10 years. Though a moderate supporter of reform, he continued to support the patronage machine and dominance of the True Whig Party. As president he helped establish the Booker Washington Agricultural and Industrial Institute in Kakata in 1929. =Negotiation of a loan from the United States= By the early 1920s, Liberia's financial crisis had worsened to the point where President King headed up a commission which traveled to the United States to seek reorganization of its staggering debt burden. They arrived in March 1921, shortly after President Harding had taken office. The United States Congress had suspended all foreign credit and extension of foreign loans, even though the State Department was sympathetic to the request from the Liberian delegation. Negotiations dragged on until October before the State Department finally granted Liberia a loan for $5 million. The U.S. government under President Harding proposed anew (after an attempt made during World War I from Liberian President Howard to get a loan from the previous Woodrow Wilson Administration) to Congress a $5 million loan to Liberia. The House gave its approval but the Senate refused, creating great disappointment and a sense of desperation among Liberian officials, who worried that British and French designs on their country might now prove unstoppable. Liberia had become a charter member of the League of Nations in 1919, and Monrovia was determined to safeguard its sovereignty. =Firestone Rubber Company= Firestone Rubber Company began exporting rubber from Liberia in 1934, having obtained a concession to lease land in 1926. The Liberian economy soon came to depend on it. Through subsidiary Finance Corporation of America, Firestone also boosted the Liberian economy with a $5 million loan that permitted the government to consolidate and bond debts and fund public improvements. =Presidential election of 1927= King, with his entourage on the steps of the Peace Palace, The Hague, in 1927. King was stiffly challenged in the presidential election of 1927 by Thomas Faulkner. According to an official statement, King received 234,000 votes; however, Liberia had 15,000 registered voters at the time. Thus, King won the dubious achievement of being listed in the Guinness Book of Records for the most fraudulent election reported in history. =Forced labor and slavery scandal= After losing the 1927 presidential election to King, Thomas Faulkner accused many members of the True Whig Party government of recruiting and selling contract labor as slaves. Despite Liberia's firm denials and a refusal to cooperate, the League of Nations established a commission under the leadership of British zoologist Cuthbert Christy to determine the extent of forced labor and slavery still practiced by Liberia. U.S. President Herbert Hoover briefly suspended relations to press Monrovia into compliance. In 1930 the League of Nations published the committee's report, dubbed the ‚ÄòChristy Report‚Äô after the Committee's chairman. The report supported many of Faulkner's allegations and implicated many government officials, including vice president Allen Yancy. It was found that forced labor was used for the construction of certain public works such as roads in the interior. And certain tribes did practice domestic servitude that could be considered as slavery. The report found: # \\"In order to suppress the native, prevent him from realizing his powers and limitations and prevent him from asserting himself in any way whatever, for the benefit of the dominant and colonizing race, although originally the same African stock as themselves, a policy of gross intimidation and suppression has for years been systematically fostered and encouraged, and is the key word of the Government native policy;\\" and # that, \\"...Vice President Yancy [of Liberia] and other high officials of the Liberian Government, as well as county superintendents and district commissioners, have given their sanction for compulsory recruitment of labor for road construction, for shipment abroad and other work, by the aid and assistance of the Liberian Frontier Force; and have condoned the utilization of this force for purposes of physical compulsion on road construction for the intimidation of villagers, for the humiliation and degradation of chiefs, of captured natives to the coast, there guarding them till the time of shipment [to Fernando Po and Sao Tome.]\\" Subsequently, King and Vice-President Yancy, along with other implicated leaders, resigned.

Still, there was already much debate at the time opposing the tenets of a traditional, etymological orthography, and those of a reformed, phonological transcription of the language. C√©sar-Pierre Richelet chose the latter option when he published the first monolingual French dictionary in 1680, but the chose to adhere firmly to tradition in the first edition of its dictionary (1694). Some proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest. Fon√©tik.fr writing system proposal. Ortofasil writing system proposal.

Ortograf.net writing system proposal. 16th century Spelling and punctuation before the 16th century was highly erratic, but the introduction of printing in 1470 provoked the need for uniformity. Several Renaissance humanists (working with publishers) proposed reforms in French orthography, the most famous being Jacques Peletier du Mans who developed a phonemic-based spelling system and introduced new typographic signs (1550). Peletier continued to use his system in all his published works, but his reform was not followed. 18th century :'‚ÄîAcad√©mie, 1740, using accents for the first time The third (1740) and fourth (1762) editions of the Acad√©mie dictionary were very progressive ones, changing the spelling of about half the words altogether. Accents, which had been in common use by printers for a long time, were finally adopted by the Acad√©mie, and many mute consonants were dropped. :' ‚Üí ' (to be) :' ‚Üí ' (monastic) Many changes suggested in the fourth edition were later abandoned along with thousands of neologisms added to it. Very importantly too, subsequent 18th century editions of the dictionary added the letters J and V to the French alphabet in replacement of consonant I and U, fixing many cases of homography. :' ‚Üí ' (vile) 19th century Many changes were introduced in the sixth edition of the Acad√©mie dictionary (1835), mainly under the influence of Voltaire. Most importantly, all oi digraphs that represented were changed to ai, thus changing the whole imperfect conjugation of all verbs. The borrowing of connoisseur into English predates this change; the modern French spelling is '. :' ‚Üí ' (was) The spelling of some plural words whose singular form ended in D and T was modified to reinsert this mute consonant, so as to bring the plural in morphological alignment with the singular. Only , retained the old form, because it was perceived that the singular and the plural had different meanings. The Acad√©mie had already tried to introduce a similar reform in 1694, but had given up with their dictionary's second edition. :' ‚Üí ' (parents) 20th century With important dictionaries published at the turn of the 20th century, such as those of √âmile Littr√©, Pierre Larousse, Ars√®ne Darmesteter, and later Paul Robert, the Acad√©mie gradually lost much of its prestige. Hence, new reforms suggested in 1901, 1935, and 1975 were almost totally ignored, except for the replacement of apostrophes with hyphens in some cases of (potential) elision in 1935. :' ‚Üí ' (grandmother) Since the 1970s, though, calls for the modernisation of French orthography have grown stronger. In 1989, French prime minister Michel Rocard appointed the Superior Council of the French language to simplify the orthography by regularising it. =Rectifications of 1990 = The council, with the help of some Acad√©mie members and observers from Francophone states, published reforms that it called \\"\\" on 6 December 1990. Those \\"rectifications\\", instead of changing individual spellings, published general rules or lists of modified words. In total, around 2000 words have seen their spelling changed, and French morphology was also affected. Hyphens Numerals are joined with hyphens: :' ‚Üí ' (700,321). Elements of compound nouns are fused together: *if one element is a verb: ' ‚Üí ' (wallet) *in bahuvrihi compounds (where the individual sense of the elements has changed): ' ‚Üí ' (midwife) *in onomatopoeias: ' ‚Üí ' (quack). Loan compounds are also fused together: :' ‚Üí ' (hot dog). :' ‚Üí ', aligning the word with its modern English spelling. Number Compound nouns joined with hyphens (or fused) make their plural using normal rules, that is adding a final s or x, unless the modifier is an adjective (in which case both elements must agree), or the head is a determined noun, or a proper noun: :' ‚Üí ' (letter scales) Loanwords also have a regular plural: :' ‚Üí ' (songs) ' The ' (known as a diaeresis in English) indicating exceptionally that the u is not silent in + vowel combinations is to be placed on the u instead of on the following vowel. Also, tr√©mas are added to such words where they were not previously used: :' ‚Üí ' (fem. acute) :' ‚Üí ' (ambiguity) :' ‚Üí ' (to argue) A is also added to a u following an ' added to soften a g, to prevent the eu combination being read as : :' ‚Üí ' (wager) Accents Verbs with their infinitive in √©Cer (where C can be any consonant) change their √© to √® in the future and conditional: :' ‚Üí ' (I shall give up) Additionally, verbs ending in e placed before an inverted subject \\"je\\" change their e to √® instead of √©: :' ‚Üí ' (do I like?) Circumflex accents are removed on i and u if they are not needed to distinguish between homographs. They are retained in the simple past and subjunctive of verbs: :' ‚Üí ' (driven), but ' unchanged (he must have driven), and :' (the past participle of the very common irregular verb ', or the noun created from this participle) is kept to make the distinction with ' (the required contraction of ', which means some when used as an undetermined masculine article, or means of the when used as a preposition). Wherever accents are missing or wrong because of past errors or omissions or a change of pronunciation, they are added or changed: :' ‚Üí ' (to receive ‚Äì stolen goods) :' ‚Üí ' (event) Accents are also added to loanwords where dictated by French pronunciation: :' ‚Üí ' (diesel) Schwa changing into open e In verbs with an infinitive in ' or ', the opening of the schwa could previously be noted either by changing the e to √® or by doubling the following l or t, depending on the verb in question. With this reform, only the first rule shall be used except in the cases of ', ', and their derivatives (which continue to use ll and tt respectively). :' ‚Üí ' (I label) This applies also when those verbs are nominalized using the suffix ': :' ‚Üí ' (pile) Past participle agreement Notwithstanding the normal rules (see French verbs), the past participle ' followed by an infinitive never agrees with the object: :' ‚Üí ' (I let them go) This is an alleged simplification of the rules governing the agreement as applied to a past participle followed by an infinitive. The participle ' already followed an identical rule. Miscellaneous Many phenomena were considered as \\"anomalies\\" and thus \\"corrected\\". Some \\"families\\" of words from the same root showing inconsistent spellings were uniformized on the model of the most usual word in the \\"family\\". :' ‚Üí ' (idiocy) This rule was also extended to suffixes in two cases, actually changing them into totally different morphemes altogether: :' ‚Üí ' (haunch) :' ‚Üí ' (leveret) Isolated words were adjusted to follow older reform where they had been omitted: :' ‚Üí ' (sickly sweet) :' ‚Üí ' (onion) Lastly, some words have simply seen their spelling simplified, or fixed when it was uncertain: :' ‚Üí ' (mess) :' ‚Üí ' (punch) Application These \\"rectifications\\" were supposed to be applied beginning in 1991 but, following a period of agitation and the publication of many books such as the Union of copy editors' attacking new rules one by one, Andr√© Goosse's defending them, or Josette Rey-Debove's accepting a few (that have been added, as alternative spellings, to Le Robert), they appeared to have become, for a while, dead proposals. 21st century In 2004, an international institutional effort to revive the 1990 spelling reforms arose. Notably, a French-Belgian-Swiss association was set up to promote reform. In July of the same year, Microsoft announced that the French version of their applications would soon comply with the new spelling rules. On 23 March 2005, a version of Encarta was published using the new spelling, and, on 14 April 2005, an update of Microsoft Office was offered. Officially, French people, including public workers, are free for an undetermined length of time to continue using the old spelling. The new spelling is \\"recommended\\", but both old and new are considered correct. In Quebec, the , which was reluctant at first to apply what it prefers to call the \\"modernisation\\", because of the opposition it received in France, announced that it was now applying its rules to new borrowings and neologisms. More and more publications are modernizing spelling. Le Forum, from the Universit√© de Montr√©al, and Les √âditions Perce-Neige have adopted the new spelling. In 2009, several major Belgian publishing groups began applying the new spelling in their online publications. The 2009 edition of the incorporates most of the changes. There are 6000 words that have both the traditional and alternative spellings. The 2011 edition of the Dictionnaire Larousse incorporates all of the changes. On 3 February 2016, a report by French television channel TF1(in French) R√©forme de l'orthographe: 10 mots qui vont changer √† la rentr√©e that the reforms would be applied from the next school year caused wide outrage. There are fringe mouvements to reform the language further, for example, that which is led by the linguist Mickael Korvin who would like to radically simplify French, by eliminating accents, punctuation and capital letters, and, in 2016 inventing a new way to spell French called nouvofrancet.

What is Billing? , Rating Matters issue n. 6, 21 March 2001 The rating process involves converting call-related data into a monetary-equivalent value. Call- related data is generated at various points in the network or measurements may be taken by third party equipment such as network probes. Generally this data is something quantifiable and specific. The usage data so gathered is then either packaged by the equipment or it may be sent to a charging gateway.etc. Rating systems typically use some or all of the following types of data about a call: * Time property of the call (day of week, date, time of day) * Amount of usage (Duration of call, amount of data, number of messages, number of songs) * Destination of the call (land line, overseas, etc.) * Origin of call/ Location of the caller (for mobile networks) * Premium charges (third party charges for premium content, cost of physical items such as movie tickets) Generally individual calls are rated and then the rated amounts are sent to a billing system to provide a bill to the subscriber. Often the rating system will be a module of a larger \\"Billing System\\" architecture. A rating system must be adapted to the constantly changing pricing policies, which have the strategic goal of stimulating demand.Susana Schwartz (2006) Mobile Operators Race to Embrace Retail Models Billing World and OSS Today 10/2006 Data structures To perform the rating calculations it is necessary to produce a Call detail record/EDR.

EDR stands for Event Data/Detail Record. EDR records are used for systems that charge more than calls - content. e.g. buying ring tones. The generated CDR/EDR may not be in a form suitable for the particular rating system. In this case a piece of software, known as the mediation system, may be required to render the data into a form useful by the rating system. The mediation system is also useful for gathering data from various sources to aggregate into one record. In spoken language CDR usually refers to any type of record: voice, SMS or data. Design choices: support for non programming configuration In complex systems there's the need of the flexibility to modify and maintain the system by an interface more human- readable than programing code, like editing tables where the behavior of the system is defined. This allows both a quicker editing and the possibility to let the configuration and maintenance of the system to non programmers, like business/tariff analysts. This flexibility comes at the cost of a heavier computational time. The support for \\"code external\\" textual configuration of both rating cases-amounts and the algorithmic rating process steps, is sometimes called \\"Rule-based Rating\\".Carl Wright, Service Level LLC (2002) Program Code Based vs. Table-driven vs. Rule-Based Rating, Rating Matters issue n. 12, 13 November 2002 Rule-based rating is one simple example of the use of the more general control table technique. As the telecommunications market comes under increasing pressure from new technologies (for example WiMAX), the leading differentiating factors between competing operators is often the innovation in new product offerings, and time to market. This leads to a natural tension between the capabilities that are offered by: * conventional configuration only systems (in which the products one operator can configure can also be offered by another), * rule based systems (in which new offerings can be created more easily, but performance considerations might not allow these to be offered to mass markets), and * programmed systems (in which you can create many more innovations, but the time to market and cost of implementation may be higher). In real life situations, even the most configurable systems generally have an implementation phase, in which new capabilities are created using programming methods, and a configuration phase, in which the new capabilities are configured and offered to the mass market. Complex rating As competition increased in the telecommunications space, rating is getting increasingly complex. Some rating scenarios use multiple measurements. Example: :Rating for a video download may involve measuring the number of minutes, the amount of data, the quality of data transfer as identified by the service level agreement (SLA) and the usage (copyright) cost of the video. Example: :A data session representing viewing a video-on-demand session, with a one-off charge, should not charge the user for the data volume since it was already charged for the video. These two charging events are correlated and the data volume spent on streaming video isn't charged to the user's data bundle/account. Complex rating could also involve non-network related parameters. Some of the rating data may come from the customer care or billing sub-systems. Example: :When usage above a certain amount is triggered in the billing sub-system the rating engine may assign a lower rate for the user. This is also known as an adjusting rate and can be complex to model in certain systems. Complex rating behaviour could be due to particular real or virtual behaviour. Example: :Subscribers who play an affiliated on line game may trade in-game currency or equipment or incentive tokens for discounted calls to other players of the game. Among the issues of rating that are unexpected sources of complexity is Daylight Saving Time time offsets.Carl Wright, Service Level LLC Why a Day Isn't Always 24 Hours Long Neutral currency rating Modern rating engines may also be currency neutral. Certain multi-national telecommunication providers provide the ability for subscribers settlement in multiple currencies. In this scenario the rating engine generates a currency neutral billing record. It is the billing engine which is assigned with converting the virtual currency into an actualized cost. Re- rating In some scenarios it may be necessary to re-rate calls but not all rating engines are capable of this. There is a philosophical argument as to the usefulness of re-rating, with no clear correct answer: =Pro re-rating= * It is useful to be able to correct errors that are identified. * The calculation of complex discounts may not be possible until all the calls for a billing cycle have been received. * Re-rating solves problems with CDRs arriving late. The flow of CDRs that reach the rating processes often can not be relied on to deliver the calls in the order in which they are needed for customer access to their billing information. When you charge for services provided by other providers (for example, international calls made while roaming in another carrier's region, services billed to your home number from a pay phone or other remote location), these CDRs may be delayed and arrive out of the order expected in the reporting of usage to customers. When usage records arrive out of order, you may need to re-rate previously received usage records. =Against re-rating= * The pro re-rating arguments are in fact based on a dying paradigm: Billing is done in a batch system, and the customer has no access to the un-billed information. This is not really the case any more: ** Modern billing systems are convergent (they can handle real time and batch rating on the same platform at the same time). Re-rating is not possible for real time events, because they would no longer be real time by definition ** Modern billing systems with self-care interfaces (so that the customer can see their charges on a web site in near real-time) means that re-rating is not possible. It would be unacceptable for the customer to see one price one day, and a different one later ** Re-rating must be completed before the bill production, which is usually monthly. It is sometimes not possible to perform re-rating for all the CDRs that should be re-rated, because the billing cycle is already closed. A closed bill is a legal document and cannot under any circumstances be modified * There is a natural wastefulness in re-rating: Telecommunications hardware is expensive, and should normally be exploited near to its capacity to maximise the return on investment. Re-rating means that extra capacity must be purchased, and will usually not be used. * Re- rating is often seen as a safety net for human error. However, if there is a safety net, errors are more likely to occur, and testing and planning may decrease in quality and thoroughness See also *Phone fraud *Test Call Generator *Revenue assurance *Telecommunications billing References External links *Real-time interconnect billing system and method of use *A collection of information resources on rating & billing (Service Level LLC) *Carl Wright, Service Level LLC (2003) Block Of Time Rating, Rating Matters issue n. 15, 28 February 2003 Telecommunications economics ","title":"Telecommunications rating"},{"id":"995019","text":"In quantum field theory, the mass gap is the difference in energy between the lowest energy state, the vacuum, and the next lowest energy state. The energy of the vacuum is zero by definition, and assuming that all energy states can be thought of as particles in plane-waves, the mass gap is the mass of the lightest particle. Since the energies of exact (i.e. nonperturbative) energy eigenstates are spread out and therefore they are not technically eigenstates, a more precise definition is that the mass gap is the greatest lower bound of the energy of any state which is orthogonal to the vacuum. The analog of a mass gap in many-body physics on a discrete lattice arises from a gapped Hamiltonian. Mathematical definitions For a given real-valued quantum field \\\\phi(x), where x = (\\\\boldsymbol{x},t), we can say that the theory has a mass gap if the two-point function has the property :\\\\langle\\\\phi(0,t)\\\\phi(0,0)\\\\rangle\\\\sim \\\\sum_nA_n\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\Delta_nt\\\\right) with \\\\Delta_0>0 being the lowest energy value in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian and thus the mass gap. This quantity, easy to generalize to other fields, is what is generally measured in lattice computations. It was proved in this way that Yang‚ÄìMills theory develops a mass gap on a lattice... The corresponding time-ordered value, the propagator, will have the property :\\\\lim_{p\\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\Delta(p)=\\\\mathrm{constant} with the constant being finite. A typical example is offered by a free massive particle and, in this case, the constant has the value 1/m2. In the same limit, the propagator for a massless particle is singular. Examples from classical theories An example of mass gap arising for massless theories, already at the classical level, can be seen in spontaneous breaking of symmetry or Higgs mechanism. In the former case, one has to cope with the appearance of massless excitations, Goldstone bosons, that are removed in the latter case due to gauge freedom. Quantization preserves this gauge freedom property. A quartic massless scalar field theory develops a mass gap already at classical level. Consider the equation :\\\\Box\\\\phi+\\\\lambda\\\\phi^3=0. This equation has the exact solution :\\\\phi(x)=\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{4}{\\\\rm sn}\\\\left(p\\\\cdot x+\\\\theta,-1\\\\right) ‚Äîwhere \\\\mu and \\\\theta are integration constants, and sn is a Jacobi elliptic function‚Äîprovided :p^2=\\\\mu^2\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2}}. At the classical level, a mass gap appears while, at quantum level, one has a tower of excitations and this property of the theory is preserved after quantization in the limit of momenta going to zero. Yang‚ÄìMills theory While lattice computations have suggested that Yang‚ÄìMills theory indeed has a mass gap and a tower of excitations, a theoretical proof is still missing. This is one of the Clay Institute Millennium problems and it remains an open problem. Such states for Yang‚ÄìMills theory should be physical states, named glueballs, and should be observable in the laboratory. K√§ll√©n‚ÄìLehmann representation If K√§ll√©n‚ÄìLehmann spectral representation holds, at this stage we exclude gauge theories, the spectral density function can take a very simple form with a discrete spectrum starting with a mass gap :\\\\rho(\\\\mu^2)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^NZ_n\\\\delta(\\\\mu^2-m_n^2)+\\\\rho_c(\\\\mu^2) being \\\\rho_c(\\\\mu^2) the contribution from multi-particle part of the spectrum. In this case, the propagator will take the simple form :\\\\Delta(p)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^N\\\\frac{Z_n}{p^2-m^2_n+i\\\\epsilon}+\\\\int_{4m_N^2}^\\\\infty d\\\\mu^2\\\\rho_c(\\\\mu^2)\\\\frac{1}{p^2-\\\\mu^2+i\\\\epsilon} being 4m_N^2 approximatively the starting point of the multi-particle sector. Now, using the fact that :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty d\\\\mu^2\\\\rho(\\\\mu^2)=1 we arrive at the following conclusion for the constants in the spectral density :1=\\\\sum_{n=1}^NZ_n+\\\\int_0^\\\\infty d\\\\mu^2\\\\rho_c(\\\\mu^2). This could not be true in a gauge theory. Rather it must be proved that a K√§ll√©n-Lehmann representation for the propagator holds also for this case. Absence of multi-particle contributions implies that the theory is trivial, as no bound states appear in the theory and so there is no interaction, even if the theory has a mass gap. In this case we have immediately the propagator just setting \\\\rho_c(\\\\mu^2)=0 in the formulas above.

The Library of Congress titled the image: \\"Destitute pea pickers in California. Mother of seven children. Age thirty-two. Nipomo, California.\\"Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division. fsa1998021539/PP Accessed July 14, 2008. Biography Florence Owens Thompson was born Florence Leona Christie on September 1, 1903, in Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma. Both her parents were of Cherokee descent. Her father, Jackson Christie, had abandoned her mother, Mary Jane Cobb, before Florence was born, and her mother remarried Charles Akman (of Choctaw descent) in the spring of 1905. The family lived on a small farm in Indian Territory outside of Tahlequah. Seventeen-year-old Florence married Cleo Owens, a 23-year-old farmer's son from Stone County, Missouri, on February 14, 1921. They soon had their first daughter, Violet, followed by a second daughter, Viola, and a son, Leroy (Troy). The family migrated west with other Owens relatives to Oroville, California, where they worked in the saw mills and on the farms of the Sacramento Valley. By 1931, Florence was pregnant with her sixth child when her husband Cleo died of tuberculosis. Florence then worked in the fields and in restaurants to support her six children. In 1933, Florence had another child, returned to Oklahoma for a time, and then was joined by her parents as they migrated to Shafter, California, north of Bakersfield. There Florence met Jim Hill, with whom she had three more children. During the 1930s, the family worked as migrant farm workers following the crops in California and at times into Arizona. Florence later recalled periods when she picked of cotton from first daylight until after it was too dark to work. She said: \\"I worked in hospitals. I tended bar. I cooked. I worked in the fields. I done a little bit of everything to make a living for my kids.\\" The family settled in Modesto, California, in 1945. Well after World War II, Florence met and married hospital administrator George Thompson. This marriage brought her far greater financial security than she had previously enjoyed. Iconic photo On March 6, 1936, after picking beets in the Imperial Valley, Florence and her family were traveling on U.S. Highway 101 towards Watsonville \\"where they had hoped to find work in the lettuce fields of the Pajaro Valley.\\" On the road, the car's timing chain snapped and they coasted to a stop just inside a pea-pickers' camp on Nipomo Mesa. They were shocked to find so many people camping there‚Äîas many as 2,500 to 3,500. A notice had been sent out for pickers, but the crops had been destroyed by freezing rain, leaving them without work or pay. Years later Florence told an interviewer that when she cooked food for her children that day, other children appeared from the pea pickers' camp asking, \\"Can I have a bite?\\" While Jim Hill, her partner, and two of Florence's sons went into town to get parts to repair the car,The Tribune (San Luis Obispo) (June 17, 2007) Dorothea Lange captured suffering of itinerant workers near Nipomo. Florence and some of the children set up a temporary camp. As Florence waited, photographer Dorothea Lange, working for the Resettlement Administration, drove up and started taking photos of Florence and her family. She took seven images in the course of ten minutes.Dorothea Lange. \\"The Assignment I‚Äôll Never Forget\\". Popular Photography 46, no. 2 (June 1960), pp. 42‚Äì43, 126. Lange's field notes for the Resettlement Administration were typically very thorough, but on this particular day she had been rushing to get home after a month on assignment, and the notes she submitted with this batch of negatives do not refer to any of the seven photographs she took of Thompson and her family. It seems that the published newspaper reports about this camp were later distilled into captions for the series, which explains inaccuracies on the file cards in the Library of Congress.Sarah Meister. Dorothea Lange: Migrant Mother. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 2019. For example, one of the file cards reads: Twenty-three years later, Lange wrote of the encounter with Thompson:Dorothea Lange. ‚ÄúThe Assignment I‚Äôll Never Forget.‚Äù Popular Photography 46, no. 2 (June 1960), pp. 42‚Äì43, 126. Troy Owens, one of Thompson's sons, recounted: In many ways, Migrant Mother is not typical of Lange's careful method of interacting with her subject. Exhausted after a long road-trip, she did not speak extensively to the migrant woman, Florence Thompson, and may not have recorded any notes. According to Thompson, Lange promised the photos would never be published. Lange did send them to the San Francisco News even before sending them to the Resettlement Administration in Washington, D.C. The News ran the pictures almost immediately and reported that 2,500 to 3,500 migrant workers were starving in Nipomo, California. Within days, the pea-picker camp received of food from the federal government. Thompson and her family had moved on by the time the food arrived and were working near Watsonville, California. While Thompson's identity was not known for over 40 years after the photos were taken, the images became famous. The image which later became known as Migrant Mother, \\"achieved near mythical status, symbolizing, if not defining, an entire era in United States history.\\" Roy Stryker called Migrant Mother the \\"ultimate\\" photo of the Depression Era: \\"[Lange] never surpassed it. To me, it was the picture ... . The others were marvelous, but that was special ... . She is immortal.\\" As a whole, the photographs taken for the Resettlement Administration \\"have been widely heralded as the epitome of documentary photography.\\" Edward Steichen described them as \\"the most remarkable human documents ever rendered in pictures.\\" Thompson's identity was discovered in the late 1970s. In 1978, acting on a tip, Modesto Bee reporter Emmett Corrigan located Thompson at her mobile home in Space 24 of the Modesto Mobile Village and recognized her from the 42-year-old photograph.King, Peter H. (October 18, 1998) The Fresno Bee One defiant family escapes poignant portrait of poverty. Section: Vision; Page F1. Florence was quoted as saying \\"I wish she [Lange] hadn't taken my picture. I can't get a penny out of it. She didn't ask my name. She said she wouldn't sell the pictures. She said she'd send me a copy. She never did.\\" As Lange was funded by the federal government when she took the picture, the image was public domain and Lange was not entitled to royalties. However, the picture did help make Lange a celebrity and earned her \\"respect from her colleagues.\\" While the image was being prepared for exhibit in 1938,James C. Curtis.

Accessed May 26, 2007. the negative of the photo was retouched to remove Florence's thumb from the lower-right corner of the image. Circulation of Migrant Mother In the late 1960s, Bill Hendrie found the original Migrant Mother photograph along with 31 other unretouched, vintage photos by Dorothea Lange in a dumpster at the San Jose Chamber of Commerce.Neff, Cynthia. (October 20, 2005) The Tribune (San Luis Obispo) Face of hard times has a big payday. Dorothea Lange's famous 'Migrant Mother' Depression photograph, taken in Nipomo, and others collect almost $300,000 at auction. After the death of Hendrie and his wife, their daughter, Marian Tankersley, rediscovered the photos while emptying her parents' San Jose home. In October 2005, an anonymous buyer paid $296,000 at Sotheby's for the 32 rediscovered Lange photos‚Äînearly six times their pre-bid estimate. In 1998, the retouched photo of Migrant Mother became a 32-cent U.S. Postal Service stamp in the 1930s portion of the Celebrate the Century series.Bennett, Lennie. (May 11, 2008) St. Petersburg Times A mother's strength knows no bounds. Section: Latitudes; Page 2L. The stamp printing was unusual since daughters Katherine McIntosh (on the left in the stamp) and Norma Rydlewski (in Thompson's arms in the stamp) were alive at the time of the printing and \\"It is very uncommon for the Postal Service to print stamps of individuals who have not been dead for at least 10 years.\\"Garchik, Leah.

Los Angeles Times. September 17, 1983. Florence Thompson, whose pensive, languid face became a symbol of the Great Depression, died Friday - only weeks after her family issued a national plea for money to help defray her mounting medical [costs]. Thompson was hospitalized and her family appealed for financial help in late August 1983. By September, the family had collected $35,000 in donations to pay for her medical care. Florence died of \\"stroke, cancer and heart problems\\" at Scotts Valley, California, on September 16, 1983 at age 80. She was buried in Lakewood Memorial Park, in Hughson, California, and her gravestone reads: \\"FLORENCE LEONA THOMPSON Migrant Mother ‚Äì A Legend of the Strength of American Motherhood.\\" In a 2008 interview with CNN, Thompson's daughter Katherine McIntosh recalled how her mother was a \\"very strong lady\\", and \\"the backbone of our family\\". She said: \\"We never had a lot, but she always made sure we had something. She didn't eat sometimes, but she made sure us children ate. That's one thing she did do.\\" Son Troy Owens said that more than 2,000 letters received along with donations for his mother's medical fund led to a re- appraisal of the photo: \\"For Mama and us, the photo had always been a bit of [a] curse. After all those letters came in, I think it gave us a sense of pride.\\" Other six photographs Lange took seven photos that day, the last being the famous Migrant Mother.

It was launched in September 2004 and was removed from the channel in February 2010. History Bionix broke away from YTV's \\"Keep It Weird\\" style and had a more technological feel to it in an effort to appeal to a teenage audience. Most of the programming consisted of anime. However, other programs were often included in order to ensure the Canadian content regulations were met. These programs include reruns of both older Mainframe Entertainment TV series (such as Dark Oracle) and live action YTV productions. On July 19, 2008, Bionix was moved from Fridays to its new timeslot on Saturdays, from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. On May 16, 2009, the block was pushed further back to midnight, and the viewer advisory bumps were switched from the Bionix-themed bumps to YTV's version. In September 2009, Bionix once again became a two-hour block, now airing at midnight and featuring two episodes of both Naruto and Bleach. The block's promos and bumps were removed for its final months of broadcast. In February 2010, YTV's website removed both the Bionix page and the Bionix on Demand page, leading to speculation that the block would soon be canceled. YTV removed the Bionix block that same month without public notice, with the final episodes being the back-to-back reruns of Bleach at 1:00 a.m. EST on February 7, 2010.

Although not as famous as Tom√°s Luis de Victoria, he was highly regarded at the time, and Victoria himself considered him to be his equal. Biography Alonso Lobo's \\"Credo romano\\", El Escorial. Lobo was born in Osuna, and after being a choirboy at the cathedral in Seville, he received a degree at the University of Osuna, and took a position as a canon at a church in Osuna sometime before 1591. In that year, the Seville Cathedral appointed him as assistant to Francisco Guerrero, and he later became maestro de capilla during Guerrero's leave of absence. In 1593, Toledo Cathedral hired him as maestro de capilla; he remained there until 1604, when he returned to Seville, where he died. Lobo's music combines the smooth contrapuntal technique of Palestrina with the sombre intensity of Victoria. Some of his music also uses polychoral techniques, which were common in Italy around 1600, though Lobo never used more than two choirs (contemporary choral music of the Venetian school often used many more -- the Gabrielis often wrote for as many choirs as there were choir-lofts at St Mark's Basilica). Lobo was influential far beyond the borders of his native Spain: in Portugal, and as far away as Mexico, for the next hundred years or more he was considered to be one of the finest Spanish composers. His works include masses and motets, three Passion settings, Lamentations, psalms and hymns, as well as a Miserere for 12 voices (which has since become lost). His best-known work, Versa est in luctum, was written on the death of Philip II in 1598. No secular or instrumental music by Lobo is known to survive today.

Forrester was the mother of Dr. Clayton Forrester (Trace Beaulieu). Initially devised as a guest character, Pearl would take on an increasingly important role in the series, first as a replacement supporting character for Dr Forrester and subsequently replacing him as the lead mad scientist. Character Pearl's first appearance was in episode 607, Bloodlust!. Her character was featured in the opening and closing host segments when she paid a visit to Dr Forrester and his current assistant, TV's Frank. It became apparent that Frank had become a firm friend of Pearl's through a long correspondence, and Pearl was much more interested in spending time with him than her own son. At the end of the sixth season, TV's Frank died (and was guided to 'Second Banana Heaven' by 'Torgo The White', a reference to the reborn Gandalf the White from Lord of the Rings). Forrester moved in to help her son at the beginning of the seventh season, and became a regular cast member from that point until the end of the show's tenth and final season. When Trace Beaulieu left at the end of the season, Pearl took over as the head Mad at the beginning of the eighth season. According to the backstory presented at that time, Pearl killed Dr. Forrester (after he had re- attained adulthood following his transformation into a 2001-esque Space Baby), then vowed to \\"avenge his death\\" by continuing his experiments on Mike and the Bots; she had herself cryogenically frozen until the year 2525 (probably a reference to the 1960s song \\"In the Year 2525\\") and became the leader of the Planet of the Apes-like apes who now dominated Earth, at which point she (apparently) somehow drew the Satellite of Loves crew back to the ship so that she could send them bad movies. In the episode \\"The Deadly Mantis,\\" the Earth was destroyed, when Professor Bobo and Dr. Peanut helped their mutant neighbors fix their thermonuclear device. From then until the end of the series, she was assisted by Professor Bobo, who often addressed her as \\"Lawgiver\\" (another Planet of the Apes reference), and Observer (a.k.a. Brain Guy). During the episode \\"Quest of the Delta Knights\\" she becomes frustrated with a significant lack of progress in the experiment and decides to do some role-reversal to see firsthand what is wrong with the experiment, switching places with Mike in the Satellite of Love while Mike takes her place in Castle Forrester. During the movie, in lieu of a smoke, she decides to suck on a mint and shares with the bots. She is later referred to as \\"Mintgiver\\" by the bots. When the Satellite of Love returned to the present, Pearl and her lackeys followed and took up residence at Castle Forrester, ancestral home of the Forrester family, where she found records of a long line of Forresters who had performed experiments similar to those she and Dr. Forrester conducted on Mike and the Bots. Oddly, Pearl claims to be descended from these Forresters, indicating that Dr. Forrester used his mother's original surname, rather than that of his father (whoever that might be), which might suggest that he was born out of wedlock, or that the strong-willed Pearl refused to change her surname on marriage and insisted on her children bearing her name, or possibly that his father died before he was born. Indeed, Pearl has been married several times, with all of her husbands meeting gruesome fates on their honeymoons (it is implied that she was responsible for all their deaths): * Chuck ‚Äì became a prairie dog when he and Pearl visited a prairie dog colony in South Dakota; cause of death unrevealed * Felipe ‚Äì shot * Maury ‚Äì had hatpins shoved through his eyes right before the ceremony, presumably lingered long enough to in fact marry Pearl, then die on the honeymoon * Wendell ‚Äì shot * Jerome ‚Äì cause of death unrevealed (by her sinister tone of voice when she alludes to his death, it is implied he died in a particularly gruesome manner) Which, if any, of these men was Dr. Forrester's father is unrevealed. At the end of the series, Pearl accidentally used a new controller to send the Satellite of Love crashing back to Earth. She supposedly became the ruler of Qatar, where she vowed that her first item of business would be to insert a \\"U\\" in the nation's name. She is last seen with her lair devoid of furnishings (it is evident that they are nearly moved out), attempting to dance and sing \\"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\\" with her cronies by the light of a lone light bulb in a parody of the final episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Her last words to Mike and the Bots before pulling the plug on Castle Forrester's observation equipment were, \\"Look, Nelson. Move on. I am.\\" She then makes an appearance in her van with Professor Bobo and Brain Guy deliberately trying to avoid her granddaughter Kinga. She had previously sent her a clone named Synthia, who had helped Kinga lure Jonah for the new round of experiments.

Primula officinalis Hill), is a herbaceous perennial flowering plant in the primrose family Primulaceae. The species is native throughout most of temperate Europe and western Asia, and although absent from more northerly areas including much of northwest Scotland, it reappears in northernmost Sutherland and Orkney and in Scandinavia. This species frequently hybridizes with other Primulas such as Primula vulgaris to form false oxlip (Primula √ó polyantha) which is often confused with true oxlip (Primula elatior), a much rarer plant.  Names  The common name cowslip may derive from the old English for cow dung, probably because the plant was often found growing amongst the manure in cow pastures. An alternative derivation simply refers to slippery or boggy ground; again, a typical habitat for this plant. The species name veris (of spring) is the genitive case form of Latin \\"ver\\" (spring). However, primrose P. vulgaris, flowers earlier, from December to May in the British isles. Other common names include cuy lippe, herb peter, paigle or pagilNotes to Beachy Head; with Other Poems: Charlotte Smith, 1807, peggle, key flower, key of heaven, fairy cups, petty mulleins, crewel, buckles, palsywort, and plumrocks.Cowslip, from A Modern Herbal  Description  Primula veris Primula veris ‚Äì MHNT Albrecht D√ºrer, Tuft of Cowslips, 1526, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., NGA 74162 Primula veris is a variable evergreen or semi-evergreen perennial plant growing to tall and broad, with a rosette of leaves 5‚Äì15 cm long and 2‚Äì6 cm broad. The deep yellow flowers are produced in spring, in clusters of 10‚Äì30 blooms together on a single stem. Each flower is 9‚Äì15 mm broad. Red- and orange-flowered plants occur rarely but can be locally widespread in areas where coloured primula hybrids bloom at the same time as the native cowslip, enabling cross-pollination.  Habitat and conservation  Primula veris in a meadow. The cowslip is frequently found on more open ground than the primrose, including open fields, meadows, coastal dunes and clifftops. The plant suffered a decline due to changing agricultural practices throughout the 1970s and 1980s in Britain. It may therefore be rare locally, though where found it may be abundant. Additionally the seeds are now often included in wildflower seed mixes used to landscape motorway banks and similar civil engineering earthworks where the plants may be seen in dense stands. This practice has led to a revival in its fortunes.http://your.caerphilly.gov.uk/countryside/sites/your.caerphilly.gov.uk.countryside/files/pdf/actionplan/vol2-10-cowslip.pdf In cultivation this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  Similar species  Red-flowered Primula veris plants The cowslip may be confused with the closely related Primula elatior (oxlip) which has a similar general appearance and habitat, although the oxlip has larger, pale yellow flowers more like a primrose, and a corolla tube without folds.  Chemical constituents  The roots of Primula veris contain several glycosides of 5-methoxysalicylic methyl ester, such as primeverinSee for chemical structure and primulaverin.See Merck Index monograph for chemical details In the dried crude root, their phenolic aglycones are responsible for the typical odour reminiscent of methyl salicylate or anethole. The dried roots contain significant amounts of triterpene saponins, such as primula acid I/II, while in the flower these constituents are located in the sepals, and the dominating constituents are flavonoids. Rare side effects of the saponins can be nausea or diarrhoea while some of the phenolic constituents are possibly responsible for allergic reactions. The subspecies macrocalyx, growing in Siberia, contains the phenolic compound riccardin C.  Cuisine  Cowslip leaves have been traditionally used in Spanish cooking as a salad green. Uses in English cookery include using the flowers to flavor country wine and vinegars; sugaring to be a sweet or eaten as part of a composed salad while the juice of the cowslip is used to prepare tansy for frying. The close cousin of the cowslip, the primrose P. vulgaris has often been confused with the cowslip and its uses in cuisine are similar with the addition of its flowers being used as a colouring agent in desserts. English children's writer Alison Uttley in her story \\"The Country Child\\" (1931) of family life on an English farm from the perspective of a 9-year-old farmer's daughter Susan describes cowslips among the favourite flowers of her heroine and mentions her participation in preparing them for making cowslip wine, a locally important process. After its initial preparation, cowslip wine \\"would change to sparkling yellow wine\\" offered in \\"little fluted glasses\\" with a biscuit to important \\"morning visitors\\" of the farm: such as the curate coming for subscriptions, the local squire (landowner) and an occasional dealer (of their produce). This wine \\"was more precious than elderberry wine, which was the drink for cold weather, for snow and sleet\\".  Myth and folklore  This herb was already mentioned by Pliny the Elder for its early blooming attributes. Species from the genus Primula along with other ritual plants played a significant role in the pharmacy and mythology of the Celtic druids, likely as an ingredient of magical potions to increase the absorption of other herbal constituents. In the Middle-Ages it was also known as St. Peter's herb or Petrella and was sought after by Florentine apothecaries. Hildegard von Bingen recommended the medicinal parts only for topical use but the leaves were also consumed as food. Other common names at the time were 'Herba paralysis', 'Verbascum', primrose or mullein leaves. It was frequently misidentified as or confused with similar species from the genus Primula.ES Burgess (Jan. 1902).

Demaine (born 28 February 1981) is a professor of Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former child prodigy.  Early life and education  Demaine was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to artist sculptor Martin L. Demaine and Judy Anderson. From the age of 7, he was identified as a child prodigy and spent time traveling across North America with his father. He was home-schooled during that time span until entering university at the age of 12. Demaine completed his bachelor's degree at 14 years of age at Dalhousie University in Canada, and completed his PhD at the University of Waterloo by the time he was 20 years old. Demaine's PhD dissertation, a work in the field of computational origami, was completed at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of Anna Lubiw and Ian Munro. This work was awarded the Canadian Governor General's Gold Medal from the University of Waterloo and the NSERC Doctoral Prize (2003) for the best PhD thesis and research in Canada. Some of the work from this thesis was later incorporated into his book Geometric Folding Algorithms on the mathematics of paper folding published with Joseph O'Rourke in 2007.

Many AAs will also offer a simple menu system (\\"for sales, press 1, for service, press 2,\\" etc.). An auto attendant may also allow a caller to reach a live operator by dialing a number, usually \\"0\\". Typically the auto attendant is included in a business's phone system such as a PBX, but some services allow businesses to use an AA without such a system. Modern AA services (which now overlap with more complicated interactive voice response or IVR systems) can route calls to mobile phones, VoIP virtual phones, other AAs/IVRs, or other locations using traditional land-line phones or voice message machines. Feature description Telephone callers will recognize an automated attendant system as one that greets calls incoming to an organization with a recorded greeting of the form, \\"Thank you for calling .... If you know your party's extension, you may dial it any time during this message.\\" Callers who have a touch tone (DTMF) phone can dial an extension number or, in most cases, wait for operator (\\"attendant\\") assistance. Since the telephone network does not transmit the DC signals from rotary dial telephones (except for audible clicks), callers who have rotary dial phones have to wait for assistance. On a purely technical level it could be argued that an automated attendant is a very simple kind of IVR, however in the telecom industry the terms IVR and auto attendant are generally considered distinct. An automated attendant serves a very specific purpose (replace live operator and route calls), whereas an IVR can perform all sorts of functions (telephone banking, account inquiries, etc.). An AA will often include a directory which will allow a caller to dial by name in order to find a user on a system. There is no standard format to these directories, and they can use combinations of first name, last name, or both. The following lists common routing steps that are components of an automated attendant (any other routing steps would probably be more suitable to an IVR): * Transfer to extension * Transfer to voicemail * Play message (i.e., \\"our address is ...\\") * Go to a sub menu * Repeat choices In addition, an automated attendant would be expected to have values for the following * '0' - where to go when the caller dials '0' * Timeout - what to do if the caller does nothing (usually go to the same place as '0') * Default mailbox - where to send calls if '0' is not answered (or is not pointing to a live person) Background PBXs (private branch exchanges) or PABXs (private automatic branch exchanges) are telephone systems that serve an organization that has many telephone extensions but fewer telephone lines (sometimes called \\"trunks\\") that connect that organization to the rest of the global telecommunications network. While persons within an enterprise served by a PBX can call each other by dialing their extension numbers, incoming calls, i.e., calls originating from a telephone not served by the PBX but intended for a party served by the PBX, required assistance from a switchboard operator (also called a \\"switchboard attendant\\") or a telephone service called DID (\\"direct inward dialing\\"). Direct inward dialing has advantages such as rapid connection to the destination party and disadvantages including cost, lack of identification of the called organization and use of ten-digit telephone numbers. Automated attendants provide, among many other things, a way for an external caller to be directed to an extension or department served by a PBX system without using direct inward dialing or without switchboard attendant assistance. History While many users may think an automated attendant is part of voice mail it is not. Voice messaging (or voicemail or VM) technology was around since the late 1970s but in the early 1980s companies provided voice prompting systems that allowed callers to reach (route the call) to an intended party, not necessarily to leave a message. Automated attendant systems are also referred to as automated menu systems and much early work in this field was done by Michael J. Freeman Ph.D. Time-based routing Many auto attendants will have options to allow for time of day routing, as well as weekend and holiday routing. The specifics of these features will depend entirely on the particular automated attendant, but typically there would be a normal greeting and routing steps that would take place during normal business hours, and a different greeting and routing for non-business hours.

The Aztec armed forces were typically composed of a large number of commoners (yƒÅ≈çquƒ´zqueh , \\"those who have gone to war\\") who possessed only basic military training, and a smaller but still considerable number of professional warriors belonging to the nobility (pƒ´piltin ) and who were organized into warrior societies and ranked according to their achievements. The Aztec state was centered on political expansion and dominance of and exaction of tribute from other city states, and warfare was the basic dynamic force in Aztec politics. Aztec society was also centered on warfare: every Aztec male received basic military training from an early age and the only possibility of upwards social mobility for commoners (mƒÅcehualtin ) was through military achievement ‚Äî especially the taking of captives (mƒÅltin , singular malli). Thus, only specifically chosen men served in the military. The sacrifice of war captives was an important part of many of the Aztec religious festivals. Warfare was thus the main driving force of both the Aztec economy and religion.  Warfare in Aztec society  Terracotta statue depicting an Eagle Warrior There were two main objectives in Aztec warfare. The first objective was political: the subjugation of enemy city states (Altepetl) in order to exact tribute and expand Aztec political hegemony. The second objective was religious and socioeconomic: the taking of captives to be sacrificed in religious ceremonies. These dual objectives also influenced the kind of warfare practiced by the Aztecs. Most warfare was primarily political and was driven by the expectations of the Aztec nobility for the TlahtoƒÅni to provide economic growth through expansion and the expectation of the commoners to have a chance of moving up in society through successful warfare. The first action of a ruler elect was always to stage a military campaign which served the dual purpose of showing his ability as a warrior and thus make it clear to subject polities that his rule would be as tough on any rebellious conduct as that of his predecessor, and to provide abundant captives for his coronation ceremony.Hassig, Ross. \\"Moteuczomah Illhuicamina.\\" Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1988. 158. Print. A failed coronation campaign was seen as an extremely bad omen for the rule of a Tlatoani and could lead to rebellions of city states subjected by earlier rulers and to the Aztec nobility distrusting his ability to rule ‚Äî this was the case for Tizoc who was poisoned by the Aztec nobles after several failed military campaigns.Hassig, Ross. \\"Tizoc.\\" Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1988. 198. Print. =Flower War= The second kind of warfare practiced by the Aztecs was referred to as Flower war (x≈çchiyƒÅ≈çy≈çtl ). This kind of warfare was fought by smaller armies after a previous arrangement between the parties involved. It was not aimed directly at the enemy city-state (altepetl) but served a number of other purposes. One often cited purpose is the taking of sacrificial captives and this was certainly an important part of most Aztec warfare. Friar Diego Dur√°n and the chronicles based on the Cr√≥nica X states that the Xochiyaoyotl was instigated by Tlacaelel during the great Mesoamerican famine of 1450-1454 under the reign of Moctezuma I. These sources state that Tlacaelel arranged with the leaders of Tlaxcala, Cholula, and Huexotzinco, and Tliliuhquitepec to engage in ritual battles that would provide all parties with enough sacrificial victims to appease the gods. Ross Hassig (1988) however poses four main political purposes of xochiyaoyotl: # This kind of warfare gave the Aztecs a chance to demonstrate their military might. Since the Aztec army was larger than their adversaries that were normally smaller city states and since the numbers of combatants on each side were fixed, the Aztec army was sending a much smaller percentage of their total forces than their opponents. Losing a Flower War would then be less damaging for the Aztec army than for its opponents. # This also meant that an objective was attrition ‚Äî the large Aztec army could afford to engage in small scale warfare much more frequently than their opponents, who would then gradually tire until they were ripe for actual conquest. # It also allowed a ruler to maintain hostilities, at low intensity, while occupied by other matters. # Mainly Xochiyaoyotl served as propaganda both towards other city-states and to the Aztec people allowing the Aztec rulers to continuously demonstrate their might with a constant influx of war captives to Tenochtitlan. # Most importantly, the flower war served as a function of capturing victims to perform ritual sacrifice. To the East of the growing Aztec empire was the city-state of Tlaxcala. The Tlaxcalans were a powerful people who shared their culture and language with the people of the Aztec empire proper. They were closely related to the empire, though never actually conquered by it. An agreement was made with the Tlaxcalans to have ritual battles called xochiyaoyotl. The flower war is a ritual war for Aztec people taking victim back and sacrifice them to their god Xipe Totec (Tezcatlipoca).  Birth ritual  Warriors were essential to Aztec life and culture. At birth, an Aztec boy would receive two symbols of being a warrior. A shield would be placed in his left hand, and an arrow would be placed in his right. After a short ceremony the newly born boy's umbilical cord, shield, and arrow would be taken to a battlefield to be buried by a renowned warrior. These parts would symbolize the rise of a warrior. Each shield and arrow would be made specifically for that boy and would resemble his family and the gods. These birth rituals show the importance of warrior culture to the Aztecs. As for girls, at birth their umbilical cord would be buried usually under the family fireplace, representing the woman's future life to be in the home taking care of household needs.  Life outside warfare  Since all boys starting at age 15 were trained to become warriors Aztec society as a whole had no standing army. Therefore, warriors would be drafted to a campaign through a Tequital (a payment of goods and labor enforced by the government). Outside of battle, many warriors were farmers and tradesmen. They would learn their trade from their father. Warriors would be married by their early twenties and would be a vital part of Aztec daily life. They would work a certain trade usually passed on through family status. Warriors would be lower class citizens, that when called upon would engage in battle. Being a warrior did, however, present a way to move up in Aztec society. The warrior's life was a chance to change one's social status. If they were successful as a warrior they would be presented with gifts and recognized publicly for their accomplishments in battle. If they reached the rank of Eagle or Jaguar warrior they would be considered as nobles. They would also become full-time warriors working for the city-state to protect merchants and the city itself. They resembled the police force of Aztec society.  Appearance of warriors  Nezahualcoyotl dressed in cotton armor with an obsidian sword, shield, and a helmet in the shape of a coyote or wolf. Codex Ixtlilxochitl, c. 1550. Aztec culture valued appearance, and appearance defined people within society. Warriors had a very distinct appearance. Their dress would be in relation to their success and triumph on the battlefield. Gaining ranks as an Aztec warrior was based on how many enemy soldiers that warrior had captured. A warrior who had taken one captive would carry a macuahuitl, and a chimalli without any decorations. He would also be rewarded with a manta, and an orange cape with a stripe, a carmine-colored loincloth, and a scorpion-knotted designed cape. (Daily, 145). A two-captive warrior would be able to wear sandals on the battlefield. He would also have a feathered warrior suit and a cone-shaped cap. The feathered suit and the cone-shaped cap appearance are the most common within the Codex Mendoza. A four captive warrior, which would be an eagle or jaguar warrior, would wear an actual jaguar skin over his body with an open slot for the head. These warriors would have expensive jewelry and weapons. Their hairstyle was also unique to their status. The hair would sit at the top of their head and be parted into two sections with a red cord wrapped around it. The red cord would also have an ornament of green, blue, and red feathers. The shields were made of wicker wood and leather, so very few survived. Fortifications The Aztecs didn't normally maintain tight territorial control within their empire but nonetheless, there are examples of fortifications built by the Aztecs. Prominent examples are the strongholds at Oztuma (Ozt≈çmƒÅn ) where the Aztecs built a garrison to keep the rebellious Chontales in line; in Quauhquechollan (modern-day Huauquechula) near Atlixco where the Aztecs built a garrison in order to always have forces close to their traditional enemies the Tlaxcalteca, Chololteca and Huexotzinca; and in Malinalco near Toluca. The latter is where Ahuitzotl built garrisons and fortifications to keep watch over the Matlatzinca, Mazahua and Otomies and to always have troops close to the enemy Tarascan state - the borders with which were also guarded and at least partly fortified on both sides. Organization Aztec warriors as depicted in the Codex Mendoza The Aztec army was organized into two groups. The commoners were organized into \\"wards\\" (calp≈çlli) that were under the leadership of tiachcahuan (\\"leaders\\") and calpoleque (\\"calpulli owners\\"). The nobles were organized into professional warrior societies. Apart from the Tlatoani, the war leaders of the Aztecs were the High General, the Tlacochcalcatl (\\"The man from the house of darts\\") and the General the TlƒÅcateccatl (\\"Cutter of men\\"). The Tlacochcalcatl and Tlacateccatl also had to name successors prior to any battle so that if they died they could be immediately replaced. Priests also took part in warfare, carrying the effigies of deities into battle alongside the armies. The army also had boys about the age of twelve along with them serving as porters and messengers; this was mainly for training measures. The adjacent image shows the Tlacateccatl and the Tlacochcalcatl and two other officers (probably priests) known as Huitznahuatl and Ticocyahuacatl, all dressed in their tlahuiztli suits. =Training= The formal education of the Aztecs was to train and teach young boys how to function in their society, particularly as warriors. The Aztecs had a relatively small standing army. Only the elite soldiers part of the societies (such as the Jaguar Knights) and the soldiers stationed at the few Aztec fortifications were full-time. Nevertheless, every boy was trained to become a warrior with the exception of nobles. Trades such as farming and artisan skills were not taught at the two formal schools. All boys who were between the ages of ten and twenty years old would attend one of the two schools: the Telpochcalli or the neighborhood school for commoners, and the Calmecac which was the exclusive school for nobles. At the Telpochcalli, students would learn the art of warfare, and would become warriors. At the Calmecac students would be trained to become military leaders, priests, government officials, etc. The sons of commoners were trained in the Tƒìlpochcalli \\"house of youth\\". Once a boy reached the age of ten, a section of hair on the back of his head was grown long to indicate that he had not yet taken captives in war. At age fifteen, the father of the boy handed the responsibility of training to the telpochcalli, who would then train the boy to become a warrior. The telpochcalli was accountable for the training of approximately 419 to 559 youths between the ages of fifteen and twenty years old.Hassig, R. 1988, 31. While the boys were in training, they were given basic duties, such as cleaning the house and making fires. The youth were tested to determine how fit they would be for battle by accompanying their leaders on campaigns as shield-bearers. War captains and veteran warriors had the role of training the boys how to handle their weapons. This generally included showing them how to hold a shield, how to hold a sword, how to shoot arrows from a bow and how to throw darts with an atlatl.Hassig, R. 1988, 32‚Äì33. Boys in training were only considered real men when they captured their first warrior.Clendinnen, I. 1991, 78. Sons of the nobles were trained at the calmecac (\\"lineage house\\") and received sophisticated training in warfare from the most experienced warriors in the army, as well as in general courtly subjects such as astronomy, calendrics, rhetorics, poetry and religion. The calmecac were attached to temples as a dedication to patron gods. For example, the calmecac in the main ceremonial complex of Tenochtitlan was dedicated to the god Quetzalcoatl. Although there is uncertainty about the exact ages that boys entered into the calmecac, according to evidence that recorded the king's sons entering at the age of five and sons of other nobles entering between the ages of six and thirteen, it seems that youth began their training here at a younger age than those in the telpochcalli did.Hassig, R. 1988, 34‚Äì35. When formal training in handling weapons began at age fifteen, youth would begin to accompany the seasoned warriors on campaigns so that they could become accustomed to military life and lose the fear of battle. At age twenty, those who wanted to become warriors officially went to war. The parents of the youth sought out veteran warriors, bringing them foods and gifts with the objective of securing a warrior to be the sponsor of their child. Ideally, the sponsor would watch over the youth and teach him how to take captives. However, the degree to which the warrior looked after and helped the noble's child depended greatly on the amount of payment received from the parents. Thus, sons of high nobility tended to succeed more often in war than those of lower nobility.Hassig, R. 1988, 35‚Äì36. A page from the Codex Mendoza depicting an Aztec warrior priest and Aztec priest rising through the ranks of their orders. =Stratification and ranks= Broadly, Aztec army ranks were similar to the modern Western rankings of ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù and \\"Major‚Äù, as were the groupings of warriors into categories such as ‚Äúenlisted men‚Äù or ‚Äúofficers‚Äù. However, while parallels can be drawn between the organization of Aztec and Western military systems, as each developed from similar functional necessities, the differences between the two are far greater than the similarities. The members of the Aztec army had loyalties to many different people and institutions, and ranking was not based solely on the position one held in a centralized military hierarchy. Thus, the classification of ranks and statuses cannot be defined in the same manner as that of the modern Western military.Hassig, R. 1988, 27. The commoners composed the bulk of the army; the lowest were porters (tlamemeh ) who carried weapons and supplies, next came the youths (identified by the top knot hairstyle they wore) of the telpochcalli led by their sergeants (the tƒìlpochyahqueh \\"youth leaders\\"). Next were the commoners yaoquizqueh. And finally, there were commoners who had taken captives, the so- called tlamanih. \\"captors\\". Ranking above these came the nobles of the \\"warrior societies\\". These were ranked according to the number of captives they had taken in previous battles; the number of captives determined which of the different suits of honor (called tlahuiztli ) they were allowed to wear, and allowed them certain rights like being able to wear sandals, jewelry, alter their hairstyles, wear warpaint, carry flowers onto the battlefield, pierce, and tattoo themselves. These tlahuiztli became gradually more spectacular as the ranks progressed, allowing the most excellent warriors who had taken many captives to stand out on the battlefield. The higher ranked warriors were also called \\"Pipiltin\\". This page from the Codex Mendoza shows the gradual improvements to equipment and tlahuiztli as a warrior progresses through the ranks from \\"commoner\\" to \\"porter\\" to \\"warrior\\" to \\"captor\\", and later as a noble progressing in the warrior societies from the \\"two-captive\\" to \\"Butterfly\\" to \\"Jaguar warrior\\" (\\"Eagle warrior\\" not included) to \\"Otomitl\\" to \\"Shorn One\\" and finally as \\"Tlacateccatl\\". The Butterfly Warrior, Otomitl, and Shorn One figures wear the pamitl. =Warrior societies= Commoners excelling in warfare could be promoted to the noble class and could enter some of the warrior societies (at least the Eagles and Jaguars). Sons of nobles trained at the Calmecac, however, were expected to enter into one of the societies as they progressed through the ranks. Warriors could shift from one society and into another when they became sufficiently proficient; exactly how this happened is uncertain. Each society had different styles of dress and equipment as well as styles of body paint and adornments. Tlamanih Tlamanih (captor) was a term that described commoners who had taken captives within the Aztec army, particularly those who had taken one captive. Cuextecatl Two captive warriors, recognizable by their red and black tlahuiztli and conical hats. This rank was introduced after the military campaign against the Huastec led by TlahtoƒÅni Ahuitzotl. Papalotl Papalotl (lit. butterfly) were warriors who had taken three captives; this rank wore \\"butterfly\\" like banners on their backs. Eagle and Jaguar warriors Aztec warriors were called a cuƒÅuhocƒìl≈çtl . The word cuƒÅuhocƒìl≈çtl derives from the Eagle warrior cuƒÅuhtli and the Jaguar Warrior ocƒìl≈çtl . Those Aztec warriors who demonstrated the most bravery and who fought well became either jaguar or eagle warriors. Of all of the Aztec warriors, they were the most feared. Both the jaguar and eagle Aztec warriors wore distinguishing helmets and uniforms. The jaguars were identifiable by the jaguar skins they wore over their entire body, with only their faces showing from within the jaguar head. The eagle Aztec warriors, on the other hand, wore feathered helmets including an open beak. Otomies The Otomies (Ot≈çntin) ) were another warrior society who took their name from the Otomi people who were renowned for their fierce fighting. In the historical sources, it is often difficult to discern whether the word otomitl \\"Otomi\\" refers to members of the Aztec warrior society or members of the ethnic group who also often joined the Aztec armies as mercenaries or allies. A celebrated member of this warrior sect was Tzilacatzin. The Shorn Ones The \\"Shorn Ones\\" (Cuachicqueh , plural. Cuachic, singular) was the most prestigious warrior society ‚Äì their heads were shaved apart from a long braid over the left ear. Their bald heads and faces were painted one-half blue and another half red or yellow. They served as imperial shock troops and took on special tasks as well as battlefield assistance roles when needed. Over six captives and dozens of other heroic deeds were required for this rank. They apparently turned down captaincies in order to remain constant battlefield combatants. Recognizable by their yellow tlahuitzli, they had sworn not to take a step backward during a battle on pain of death at the hands of their comrades.Hassig, R. 1988, p. 45‚Äì46. Strategic intelligence Because the Aztec empire was maintained through warfare or the threat of war with other cities, the gathering of information about those cities was crucial in the process of preparing for a single battle or an extended campaign. Also of great importance was the communication of messages between the military leaders and the warriors on the field so that political initiatives and collaborative ties could be established and maintained. As such, intelligence and communication were vital components in Aztec warfare. The four establishments principally used for these tasks were merchants, formal ambassadors, messengers, and spies.Hassig, R. 1988, 49. =Merchants= Merchants, called pochteca (singular: pochtecatl), were perhaps the most valued source of intelligence to the Aztec empire. As they traveled throughout the empire and beyond to trade with groups outside the Aztec's control, the king would often request that the pochteca return from their route with both general and specific information. General information, such as the perceived political climate of the areas traded in, could allow the king to gauge what actions might be necessary to prevent invasions and keep hostility from culminating in large-scale rebellion. As the Aztec's empire expanded, the merchant's role gained increasing importance. Because it became harder to obtain information about distant sites in a timely way, especially for those outside the empire, the feedback and warning received from merchants were invaluable. Often, they were the key to the Aztec army's successful response to external hostility. If a merchant was killed while trading, this was a cause for war. The Aztecs' rapid and violent retaliation following this event is testament to the immense importance that the merchants had to the Aztec empire.Hassig, R. 1988, 49-50. Merchants were very well respected in Aztec society. When merchants traveled south, they transported their merchandise either by canoe or by slaves, who would carry a majority of the goods on their backs. If the caravan was likely to pass through dangerous territory, Aztec warriors accompanied the travelers to provide much-needed protection from wild animals and rival cultures. In return, merchants often provided a military service to the empire by spying on the empire's many enemies while trading in the enemy's cities.Hassig, R. 1988, 150. They were able to earn their protection while further helping their empire. Aztec priest and warrior, 1787 =Ambassadors= Once the Aztecs had decided to conquer a particular city (Altepetl), they sent an ambassador from Tenochtitlan to offer the city protection. They would showcase the advantages cities would gain by trading with the empire. The Aztecs, in return, asked for gold or precious stones for the Emperor. They were given 20 days to decide their request. If they refused, more ambassadors were sent to the cities. However, these ambassadors were used as up front threats. Instead of trade, these men would point out the destruction the empire could and would cause if the city were to decline their offer. They were given another 20 days.Hassig, R. 1988, p. 160. If they refused the Aztec army was sent immediately. There were no more warnings. The cities were destroyed and their people were taken as prisoners. =Messengers= The Aztecs used a system in which men stationed approximately apart along main roads relayed messages from the empire to armies in the field or to distant cities and vice versa. For example, the runners might be sent by the king to inform allies to mobilize if a province began to rebel. Messengers also alerted certain tributary cities of the incoming army and their food needs, carried messages between two opposing armies, and delivered news back to Tenochtitlan about the outcome of the war. While messengers were also used in other regions of Mesoamerica, it was the Aztecs who apparently developed this system to a point of having impressive communicative scope.Hassig, R. 1988, 51. =Spies= Prior to mobilization, formal spies called quimichtin(lit. Mice) were sent into the territory of the enemy to gather information that would be advantageous to the Aztecs. Specifically, they were requested to take careful note of the terrain that would be crossed, fortification used, details about the army, and their preparations. These spies also sought out those who were dissidents in the area and paid them for information. The quimichtin traveled only by night and even spoke the language and wore the style of clothing specific to the region of the enemy. Due to the extremely dangerous nature of this job (they risked a torturous death and the enslavement of their family if discovered), these spies were amply compensated for their work.Hassig, R. 1988, 51-52. The Aztecs also used a group of trade spies, known as the naualoztomeca. The naualoztomeca were forced to disguise themselves as they traveled. They sought after rare goods and treasures. The naualoztomeca were also used for gathering information at the markets and reporting the information to the higher levels of pochteca.Hassig, R. 1988, p. 165 Equipment =Ranged weapons= An obsidian projectile point Ahtlatl: (perhaps lit. \\"non-sling\\") This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God Opochtli. The Aztec dart thrower (known by the Spanish as est√≥lica) was a weapon used to hurl small darts called \\"tlacochtli\\" with greater force and from greater range than they could be thrown by hand. This weapon was considered by the Aztecs to be suited only for royalty and the most elite warriors in the army, and was usually depicted as being the weapon of the Gods. Murals at Teotihuacan show warriors using this effective weapon and it is characteristic of the Mesoamerican cultures of central Mexico. Warriors at the front lines of the army would carry the ahtlatl and about three to five tlacochtli, and would launch them after the waves of arrows and sling projectiles as they advanced into battle before engaging into melee combat. The ahtlatl could also throw spears as its name implies \\"spear thrower\\". Tlacochtli: The \\"darts\\" launched from an Atlatl, not so much darts but more like big arrows about long. Tipped with obsidian, fish bones, or copper heads. Tlahhuƒ´t≈çlli: The Aztec war bow, constructed in a self bow fashion from the wood of the tepozan tree, about long and stringed with animal-sinew. Archers in the Aztec army were designated as Tequihua. Mƒ´comƒ´tl: The Aztec arrow quiver, usually made out of animal hide, it could hold about twenty arrows. YƒÅ≈çmƒ´tl: War arrows with barbed obsidian, chert, flint, or bone points. Typically fletched with turkey or duck feathers. TƒìmƒÅtlatl: A sling made from maguey fiber. The Aztecs used oval shaped rocks or hand molded clay balls filled with obsidian flakes or pebbles as projectiles for this weapon. Bernal Diaz del Castillo noted that the hail of stones flung by Aztec slingers was so furious that even well armored Spanish soldiers were wounded. Tlacalhuazcuahuitl: A blowgun consisting of a hollow reed using poisoned darts for ammunition. The darts used for this weapon were made out of sharpened wood fletched with cotton and usually doused in the neurotoxic secretions from the skin of tree frogs found in jungle areas of central Mexico. This was used primarily for hunting rather than warfare. =Melee weapons= An Aztec Jaguar Warrior Ready For Battle according to the Codex Magliabechiano. A likeness of an Aztec Jaguar Warrior by artist and historian George S. Stuart created from drawings in the Codex Magliabechiano. Aztec warrior dress and weapons Codex Duran Representation of a Cuahuitl, Codex Telleriano-Remensis pg.34. MƒÅcuahuitl: (lit. \\"hand-wood\\", or \\"wood at hand\\") This weapon was supposed to represent the Aztec God Tezcatlipoca. Essentially a wooden sword with sharp obsidian blades embedded into its sides (similar in appearance and build to a modern cricket bat). This was the standard armament of the elite cadres. Also known in Spanish by the Taino word \\"macana\\". A blow from such a weapon was reputedly capable of decapitating a horse.Hassig (1988), p.83. Cuahuitl:(Lit. Wood) A baton made out of hardwood (more than likely oak), reminiscent of the agave plant's leaves in its shape. Tepozt≈çpƒ´lli: Wooden spear with a broad head edged with sharp obsidian blades. Quauhol≈çlli: A mace-like weapon, the handle was made out of wood topped with a wooden, rock, or copper ball or sphere.Hassig, R. (1998). Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control Oklahoma Press: Norman. pp. 85 TlƒÅximaltep≈çztli:This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God Tepoztecatl. Basically an axe, comparable to a tomahawk, the head of which was made out of either stone, copper or bronze and had a two side design, one side had a sharp bladed edge while the other one a blunt protrusion. MƒÅcuƒÅhuitz≈çctli: A club about long, with a knob on each of its four sides and a pointed tip. Huitzauhqui: This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God Huitzilopochtli. A wooden club, somewhat resembling a baseball bat. This weapon was used for melee attacks just as it was made, but other designs were studded with flint or obsidian cutting elements on its sides. Tecpatl: This weapon was meant to represent the Aztec God Xiuhtecuhtli. A dagger with a double sided blade made out of flint or obsidian with an elaborate stone or wooden handle, overall in length. Although this would have been an effective side arm, this weapon was more commonly used in Aztec sacrifice ceremonies which may point to it being wielded mostly by Aztec warrior priests. =Armor= Modern replicas of Aztec weapons. Chƒ´malli: Shields made with different materials such as the wooden shield \\"cuauhchimalli\\" or maize cane \\"otlachimalli\\". There were also ornamental shields decorated with motifs made in featherwork, these were called mƒÅhuizzoh chimalli. Ichcahuƒ´pƒ´lli: Quilted cotton armor which was soaked in salt water brine and then hung to dry in shade so that the salt would crystallize inside of it. One or two fingers thick, this material was resistant to obsidian swords and atlatl darts. ƒíhuatl: (lit. \\"skin\\") The tunic that some noble warriors wore over their cotton armour or tlahuiztli,Hassig (1988), p. 83 known in Spanish as tilma. Aztec warrior dress and weapons Tlahuiztli: The distinctively decorated suits of prestigious warriors and members of warrior societies. These suits served as a way to identify warriors according to their achievements in battle as well as rank, alliance, and social status like priesthood or nobility. Usually made to work as a single piece of clothing with an opening in the back, they covered the entire torso and most of the extremities of a warrior, and offered added protection to the wearer. Made with elements of animal hide, leather, and cotton, the tlahuiztli was most effective by enhancing the Ichcahuipilli. Cuacalalatli: The Aztec war helmet, carved out of hardwood. Shaped to represent different animals like howler monkeys, predatory cats, birds, coyotes, or Aztec deities. These helmets protected most of a warriors head down to the jawline, the design allowed the warrior to see through the animal's open jaw and they were decorated according to the wearer's tlahuiztli.Hassig, 1988, p. 67-68 PƒÅmitl: The identifying emblems that officers and members of prestigious warrior societies wore on their backs. Similar to the Japanese sashimono. These were frequently unique to their wearers, and were meant to identify the warrior at a distance. These banners allowed officers to coordinate the movement of their units.John Pohl & charles Robinson III, Aztecs and conquistadores. The Spanish Invasion & the Collapse of the Aztec Empire, Osprey publishing Ltd, p. 75 Campaigns and battles Once the decision of going to war was made the news were proclaimed in the plazas calling for mobilization of the army for several days or weeks in advance. When the troops were ready and any allied cities had been alerted and had given their consent to partake in the campaign the march began. Usually the first to march were the priests carrying the effigies, the next day the nobles marched led by the Tlacochcalcatl and Tlacateccatl. And on the third day the main bulk of the army set out with the Tenochca marching first followed by the warriors from the other cities in the alliance (Tepanecas and Texcocas) and lastly the allied forces from other cities, some of these subject cities would also join in gradually during the march as the army passed by their cities. Thanks to the efficient system of roads maintained throughout central Mexico the army marched an estimated average of 19‚Äì32 kilometers per day.Hassig, 1988, p.67-68 The size of the Aztec army varied considerably from small contingents of a few thousand warriors to large armies with tens to hundreds of thousands of warriors. In the war against Coixtlahuacan the Aztec army numbered 200,000 warriors and 100,000 porters. Other sources mention Aztec armies of up to 700,000 men.In 1506, an Aztec army numbering 400,000 men conquered Tututepec, a Mixtec kingdom. =Combat= This is a conch shell trumpeter or quiquizoani. This page from the Codex Tovar depicts the burning of a temple from an annexed city. Battles (sometimes called in Nahuatl by the metaphorical diphrasism ƒÅtl tlachinolli - literally \\"water fire\\") usually started at dawn but sometimes during the middle of the day ‚Äî smoke signals were used to show that a battle was beginning and to coordinate attacks between different divisions of the army. The signal to attack was given by the drums (Teponaztli) and the conch shell trumpet (quiquiztli) blown by the trumpeter. Usually, the battle began with projectile fire ‚Äî the bulk of the army was composed of commoners often armed with bows or slings. Then the warriors advanced into melee combat and during this phase, the atlatl was used ‚Äî this missile weapon was more effective over shorter distances than slings and bows, and much more lethal. The first warriors to enter into melee were the most distinguished warriors of the Cuachicque and the Otontin societies; then came the Eagles and Jaguars, and lastly the commoners and unpracticed youths. Until entering into melee order rank was maintained and the Aztecs would try to surround or outflank the enemy, but once the melee began the ranks dissolved into a fray of individual hand-to- hand fighting. Youths participating in battle for the first time would usually not be allowed to fight before the Aztec victory was ensured, after which they would try to capture prisoners from the fleeing enemy. It is said that, particularly during flower wars, Aztec warriors would try to capture rather than kill their foes, sometimes striving to cut a hamstring or otherwise incapacitate their opponents. This has been used as an argument to explain the defeat of the Aztecs by the SpanishClendinnen, Inga (1991) Aztecs: An Interpretation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. but this argument has been rejected by many historians ‚Äî since sources clearly state that Aztecs did kill their Spanish opponents whenever they had the chance, and quickly adapted their combat strategies to their new opponents.Lockhart, James (ed. and trans.) (1993);We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico. Berkeley: University of California Press.Restall, Matthew. Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest. Oxford University Press (2003), ch. 7 Other Aztec tactical maneuvers included feigned retreats and ambushes where small portions of Aztec forces would attack and then fall back and lure the enemy into a trap where many more warriors were hidden in the terrain. If a defending enemy retreated into their city the battle was continued there ‚Äî but normally the objective was to conquer a city rather than destroy it. Once the city was conquered the main temple would be set on fire signaling far and wide, to all concerned, the Aztec victory. If enemies still refused to surrender the rest of the city could be burned as well, but this was uncommon.The description of Aztec combat is condensed from Hassig, 1988, chapter 7 =Gladiatorial combat= This page from the Codex Tovar depicts a scene of gladiatorial sacrificial rite, celebrated on the festival of Tlacaxipehualiztli (Feast of the Flaying of Men). Victim of sacrificial gladiatorial combat, from Codex Magliabechiano. Note that he is tied to a large stone and his macuahuitl (sword/club) is covered with what appears to be feathers instead of obsidian. Victims of sacrificial gladiatorial combat had one leg chained to the ground and they had to fight a \\"succession of champions\\". If they were victorious, they were freed. If they were defeated, they were killed.Frost, J. (1862). Pictorial history of Mexico and the Mexican War: comprising an account of the ancient Aztec empire, the conquest by Cortes, Mexico under the Spaniards, the Mexican revolution, the republic, the Texan war, and the recent war with the United States. Philadelphia: Charles Desilver. Some captives were sacrificed to Tonatiuh in ritual gladiatorial combat (as was the case of the famous warrior Tlahuicole). In this rite, the victim was tethered in place to a large carved circular \\"stone\\" (temalacatl)Matos Moctezuma & Solis Olgu√≠n 2002, p.451-2. and given a mock weapon.Smith 1996, 2003, p.218. The captive was supposed to die fighting against up to four or seven fully armed jaguar and eagle knights, whereupon falling he would be promptly disemboweled by a priest, but if the captive survived he was granted freedom.  Spanish eyewitness description of Aztec warriors   Death and burial  Death was an essential part of Aztec culture from sacrifice to burial. Warriors were especially a part of this cycle and cultural aspect. When a warrior died either from battle or sacrifice, a ceremony was involved. Captured warriors would be sacrificed to the sun god and in some cases, the warrior would do the sacrifice. If a warrior died in battle his corpse would be burned there on the battlefield rather than at his city-state. An arrow from the fallen warrior on the battlefield would be brought back, dressed in the Sun god insignia and burned, which is curious since arrows were little-used weapons in Mexica armies. It was believed by the Aztecs that the same place for the afterlife of warriors was also the place for women who died during childbirth. Mourning for fallen warriors was a long and sacred process. The mourners would not bathe and groom themselves for eighty days, believing this allowed time for the fallen warrior's soul to reach the Sky of the Sun. Women had a unique role in the mourning of their dead husbands. These women would carry the cloaks of their dead husbands around with them wherever they would go. They would also let down their hair and dance in lament to the sound of beating drums. Sons would also mourn for their dead fathers. They would carry around a small box which contained the jewelry and earplugs from his father. If an eagle warrior died their burial would be in the eagle warrior hall. They would be cremated and placed in the hall. In addition to their cremated bodies, they would be buried with jewelry, jaguar clays, and gold artifacts.

History In 1979 Russell Sipe left the Southern Baptist Convention ministry. A fan of computer games, he realized in spring 1981 there was no magazine dedicated to computer games. Although Sipe had no publishing experience, he formed Golden Empire Publications in June and found investors. He chose the name of Computer Gaming World (CGW) instead of alternatives such as Computer Games or Kilobaud Warrior because he hoped that the magazine would both review games and serve as a trade publication for the industry. The first issue appeared in November, at about the same as rivals Electronic Games and Softline. (Sipe's religious background led to \\"Psalm 9:1‚Äì2\\" appearing in each issue. His successor as editor, Johnny L. Wilson, was an evangelical Christian minister.) The first issue of Computer Gaming World from late 1981 The first issues of Computer Gaming World were published from Anaheim, California, and sold for $2.75 individually or $11 for a year's subscription of six issues. These early bi-monthly issues were typically 40‚Äì50 pages in length, written in a newsletter style, including submissions by game designers such as Joel Billings (SSI), Dan Bunten (Ozark Software), and Chris Crawford. As well, early covers were not always directly related to the magazine's contents, but rather featured work by artist Tim Finkas. In January/February 1986 CGW increased its publication cycle to nine times a year, and the editorial staff included popular writers such as Scorpia, Charles Ardai, and M. Evan Brooks. CGW survived the video game crash of 1983, which badly hurt the market; by summer 1985 it was the only survivor of 18 color magazines covering computer games in 1983. In autumn 1987 CGW introduced a quarterly newsletter called Computer Game Forum (CGF), which was published during the off-months of CGW. The newsletter never became popular; only two issues were published before it was cancelled. Some of CGF's content became part of CGW, which became a monthly. The magazine went through significant expansion starting in 1991, with growing page counts reaching 196 pages by its 100th issue, in November 1992. During that same year, Johnny Wilson (who started as a contributor in 1983), became editor-in-chief, although Sipe remained as Publisher. In 1993, Sipe sold the magazine to Ziff Davis‚Äîby then the magazine was so thick that a reader reported that the December issue's bulk slowed a thief who had stolen a shopping bag containing it‚Äîbut continued on as Publisher until 1995. The magazine kept growing through the 1990s, with the December 1997 issue weighing in at 500 pages. In January 1999, Wilson left the magazine and George Jones became editor-in-chief, at a time when print magazines were struggling with the growing popularity of the Internet. Jones had been the editor-in-chief of CNET Gamecenter, and had before that been a staffer at Computer Gaming World between 1994 and 1996. He was replaced by Jeff Green in 2002. On August 2, 2006, Ziff Davis and Microsoft jointly announced that Computer Gaming World would be replaced with Games for Windows: The Official Magazine. The new magazine replaced CGW as part of Microsoft's Games for Windows initiative. In their press release, Ziff Davis indicated that much of Computer Gaming Worlds's core content and the entire staff will be transferred to the new magazine. Because of these announcements, Ziff Davis' actions appeared more on the order of a rebranding of CGW, rather than an actual cancellation. The final CGW-labeled issue was November 2006, for a total of 268 published editions. On April 8, 2008, 1UP Network announced the print edition of Games for Windows: The Official Magazine had ceased, and that all content would be moved online. At the GFW Radio Penny Arcade Expo reunion, Jeff Green claimed that the deal with Microsoft allowed CGW/GFW to continue operating, and that if it had not occurred Ziff Davis would have shut down CGW. Simultaneously with the release of the final CGW issue, Ziff Davis announced the availability of the CGW Archive. The Archive features complete copies of the first 100 issues of CGW, as well as the 2 CGF issues, for a total of 7438 pages covering 11 years of gaming. The Archive was created by Stephane Racle, of the Computer Gaming World Museum, and is available in PDF format. Every issue was processed through Optical Character Recognition, which enabled the creation of a 3+ million word master index. Although Ziff Davis has taken its CGW Archive site offline, the magazines can be downloaded from the Computer Gaming World Museum.Computer Gaming World Museum  Content  CGW featured reviews, previews, news, features, letters, strategy, and columns dealing with computer games. While console games are occasionally touched on, these are primarily the territory of CGW's sister magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly. In 2006, two of the most popular features were \\"Greenspeak\\", a final- page column written by Editor-In-Chief Jeff Green, and \\"Tom vs. Bruce\\" a unique \\"duelling-diaries\\" piece in which writers Tom Chick and Bruce Geryk logged their gameplay experience as each tried to best the other at a given game. \\"Tom vs. Bruce\\" sometimes featured a guest appearance by Erik Wolpaw, formerly of Old Man Murray. For many years, CGW never assigned scores to reviews, preferring to let readers rate their favorite games through a monthly poll. Scores were finally introduced in 1994. However, beginning in April 2006, Computer Gaming World stopped assigning quantifiable scores to its reviews. In May of the same year, CGW changed the name of its review section to Viewpoint, and began evaluating games on a more diverse combination of factors than a game's content. Elements considered include the communities' reaction to a game, developers' continued support through patches and whether a game's online component continues to grow. The reviews were formerly based on a simple five-star structure, with five stars marking a truly outstanding game, and one star signalling virtual worthlessness. Three games, Postal¬≤ by Robert Coffey, Mistmare by Jeff Green, and Dungeon Lords by Denice Cook \\"...form an unholy trinity of the only games in CGW history to receive zero- star reviews.\\"  Circulation  According to MDS Computer Gaming World had a circulation of slightly above 300,000 as of 2006. In this regard, it was slightly behind industry arch-rival PC Gamer.  Awards and acclaim  Bruce F. Webster reviewed the first issue of Computer Gaming World in The Space Gamer No. 48. Webster commented that \\"I strongly recommend this magazine to computer gamers, and just one reason alone will (in my opinion) suffice: You can now start getting from just one publication the information that you've been having to dig out of three or four or five (or six...). Get it.\\" In 1988, CGW won the Origins Award for Best Professional Adventure Gaming Magazine of 1987. The New York Times repeatedly praised CGW, placing it as one of the premier computer game publications of its time. In 1997 the newspaper called it \\"the leading computer game magazine\\", In 1999 \\"the bible of computer game purists\\", and in 2005 \\"one of the top computer game magazines\\". PC Gaming World Ziff Davis also published a sister magazine to Computer Gaming World, entitled PC Gaming World, in the United Kingdom. It was the region's third- largest computer game magazine by August 2000. In 1998, journalist Stuart Campbell described PC Gaming World as a publication with a predominantly American bent, thanks to its \\"sober, serious, text-heavy style\\". He considered it to be out of step with the British game audience. Campbell later called the magazine an \\"oddity\\" that was \\"clearly aimed primarily at a 40-something audience and beyond\\", in comparison to more youthful rivals such as PC Gamer UK and PC Zone. In July 2000, Ziff Davis sold its publishing arm in Europe to Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen (VNU), including three magazines in Germany, three in France and four in the United Kingdom. PC Gaming World migrated with these publications. At the time, The Register reported that VNU saw PC Gaming World as a poor match for its business model, which left the magazine's future uncertain. The publisher sold PC Gaming World to Computec Media a month after the purchase, citing its lack of synergy with VNU's existing brand. This transition was set to be completed in October 2000. According to , Computec planned to fold PC Gaming World together with its own PC Gameplay magazine, which it launched in 2000. PC Gaming World had closed by the first half of 2001; Computec moved the publication's subscribers to PC Gameplay, which nevertheless struggled to grow its base. The company \\"relaunched\\" PC Gameplay as PC Gaming World in 2003, but did not release the new publication's subscriber count through the Audit Bureau of Circulations during the first half of that year. Writing for GamesIndustry.biz, Kristan Reed noted that this decision was \\"never a healthy sign\\". Computec sold its entire British game magazine branch to competitor Future Publishing in late 2003.

It flowers between April and August, dependent on altitude and latitude, but occasional flowers may occur at other times.  Description  Caltha palustris is a 10‚Äì80 cm high, hairless, fleshy, perennial, herbaceous plant, that dies down in autumn and overwinters with buds near the surface of the marshy soil. The plants have many, 2‚Äì3 mm thick strongly branching roots. Its flowering stems are hollow, erect or more or less decumbent. The alternate true leaves are in a rosette, each of which consist of a leaf stem that is about 4√ó as long as the kidney-shaped leaf blade, itself between 3‚Äì25 cm long and 3‚Äì20 cm wide, with a heart-shaped foot, a blunt tip, and a scalloped to toothed, sometime almost entire margin particularly towards the tip. In their youth the leaves are protected by a membranous sheath, that may be up to 3 cm long in fully grown plants. = Inflorescence = The common marsh-marigold mostly has several flowering stems of up to 80 cm long, carrying ‚Äì mostly several ‚Äì seated leaflike stipules ‚Äì or the lower ones may be on a short petiole -, and between four and six (but occasionally as few as one or as many as twenty five) flowers. The flowers are approximately 4 (2‚Äì5¬Ω) cm in diameter. There are four to nine (mostly five) petal-like, brightly colored ‚Äì yolk yellow, white or magenta -, inverted egg-shaped sepals, each about 1¬æ (1‚Äì2¬Ω) cm long and 1‚Öì (¬æ‚Äì1¬æ) cm wide with a blunt or sometimes acute tip. Real petals and nectaries are lacking. Between fifty and hundred-twenty stamens with flattened yellow filaments and yellow tricolpate or sometimes pantoporate pollen encircle between five and twenty-five free, flattened, linear-oblong, yellow to green carpels, with a two-lobed, obliquely positioned stigma, and each with many seedbuds. This later on develops into a seated, funnel-shaped fruit (a so-called follicle) of ¬æ‚Äì2 cm long and ¬º‚Äì¬Ω cm wide, that opens with one suture at the side of the axis and contains seven to twenty ovoid, brown to black seeds of about 2¬Ω√ó1‚Öì mm.  Taxonomy  = Taxonomic history = The oldest description that is generally acknowledged in the botanical literature dates from 1700 under the name Populago by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in part 1 of his Institutiones rei herbariae. He distinguished between P. flore major, P. flore minor and P. flore plena, and already says all of these are synonymous to Caltha palustris, without mentioning any previous author. As a plant name published before 1 May 1753, Populago Tourn. is invalid. And so is the first description as Caltha palustris by Carl Linnaeus in his Genera Plantarum of 1737. But Linnaeus re-describes the species under the same name in Species Plantarum of 1 May 1753, thus providing the correct name. = Etymology = A Caltha palustris flower and bud at the Ljubljana Botanical Garden in Slovenia The generic name Caltha is derived from the Ancient Greek (), meaning \\"goblet\\", and is said to refer to the shape of the flower. The species epithet palustris is Latin for \\"of the marsh\\" and indicates its common habitat.Archibald William Smith In the UK, Caltha palustris is known by a variety of vernacular names, varying by geographical region. These include in addition to the most common two, marsh marigold and kingcup, also brave bassinets, crazy Beth, horse blob, Molly- blob,https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/molly-blob May blob, mare blob, boots, water boots, meadow-bright, bullflower, meadow buttercup, water buttercup, soldier's buttons, meadow cowslip, water cowslip, publican's cloak, crowfoot, water dragon, drunkards, water goggles, meadow gowan, water gowan, yellow gowan, goldes, golds, goldings, gools, cow lily, marybuds, and publicans-and-sinners. The common name \\"marigold\\" refers to its use in medieval churches at Easter as a tribute to the Virgin Mary, as in \\"Mary gold\\". In North America Caltha palustris is sometimes known as cowslip. However, cowslip more often refers to Primula veris, the original plant to go by that name. Both are herbaceous plants with yellow flowers, but Primula veris is much smaller.  Culture  Caltha palustris is a plant commonly mentioned in literature, including Shakespeare: :Winking Marybuds begin :To open their golden eyes (Cymbeline, ii. 3). It also appears in Charlotte Bront√´'s Shirley: :They both halted on the green brow of the Common: they looked down on the deep valley robed in May raiment; on varied meads, some pearled with daisies, and some golden with king-cups: to-day all this young verdure smiled clear in sunlight; transparent emerald and amber gleams played over it and in Thomas Hardy's poem 'Overlooking the River Stour': :Closed were the kingcups; and the mead/Dripped in monotonous green,/Though the day's morning sheen/Had shown it golden and honeybee'd. Kingcup Cottage by Racey Helps is a children's book which features the plant. In Latvia Caltha palustris is also known as , which is also used as a girls name and symbolizes fire. The word is made from 2 words ‚Äì (\\"fire\\") and (\\"burned\\"). This refers to the burning reaction that some people experience from contact with Caltha sap.  Subdivision, synonymy and culture varieties  White form seen in the Hiamalayas in Kashmir, India Caltha palustris is a very variable species. Since most character states occur in almost any combination, this provides little basis for subdivisions. The following varieties are nevertheless widely recognised.

Double flowered: \\"Flore Pleno\\" (RHS's Award of Garden Merit), \\"Multiplex\\", \\"Plena\\", \\"Semiplena\\".  Ecology  spring flood plains of the Narew river. The marsh-marigold grows in places with oxygen-rich water near the surface of the soil. It likes richer soils, but dislikes application of fertilizer and avoids high concentrations of phosphate and ammonium, and is also shy of brackish water. It is often associated with seepage that is rich in iron, because iron ions react with phosphate, thus making it unavailable for plants. The resulting insoluble mineral appears as \\"rusty\\" flocs on the water soil and the surface of the stems of marsh plants. Around the edge of lakes and rivers it grows between reeds, and it can be found in black alder coppices and other regularly flooded and always moist forests. When it is present it often visually dominates when it is in bloom. It also used to be common on wet meadows, but due to agricultural rationalization it is now limited to ditches. It is a component of Purple moor grass and rush pastures ‚Äì a type of Biodiversity Action Plan habitat in the UK. It occurs on poorly drained neutral and acidic soils of the lowlands and upland fringe. In western Europe, the marsh-marigold moth Micropterix calthella bites open the anthers of the marsh-marigold and other plants to eat the pollen. The caterpillars that are present in summer and autumn also feed on marsh-marigold, although these are sometimes found on mosses too. Another visitor of Caltha palustris in western Europe is the leaf beetle Prasocuris phellandrii, which is black with four orange stripes and around ¬Ω cm and eats the sepals. Its larvae inhabit the hollow stems of members of the parsley family. In the USA (Illinois) two species of leaf beetle can be found on Caltha: Plateumaris nitida and Hydrothassa vittata. The maggots of some Phytomyza species (Agromyzidae) are miners in Caltha leaves. = Pollination = Caltha palustris pollination by a syrphid fly Sphegina montanaFlowers produce both nectar and copious amounts of pollen which attract many insect visitors. They may be most commonly pollinated by hoverflies (Syrphidae). In Canada, beetles (Cantharidae, Nitidulidae, Coccinellidae, Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae), thrips (Thripidae), bugs (Miridae), butterflies (Pieridae), sawflies (Tenthredinidae), bees (Apidae, Halictidae, Andrenidae), ants (Formicidae) and flies (Sepsidae, Sciomyzidae, Ephydridae, Syrphidae, Anthomyiidae, Tachinidae and Muscidae) have been observed to visit the leaves or flowers, many of which were found carrying Caltha pollen. In addition to other forms of pollination, this plant is adapted to rain-pollination. Caltha palustris is infertile when self-pollinated. Rather high fertility in crosses between sibling plants suggest that this phenomenon is genetically regulated by several genes. This regulation mechanism also occurs in Ranunculus and as far as known only in these two genera. = Seed dispersal = In Caltha palustris up to two hundred seeds may be produced by each flower. When the follicles open, they form a \\"splash cup\\". When a raindrop hits one at the right angle, the walls are shaped such that the seeds are expelled. The seeds also have some spongy tissue that makes them float on water, until they wash up in a location that may be suitable for this species to grow. = Diseases = The marsh-marigold is affected by the rust species Puccinia calthea and P. calthicola.Peter Zwetko: Die Rostpilze √ñsterreichs. Supplement und Wirt- Parasit-Verzeichnis zur 2. Auflage des Catalogus Florae Austriae, III. Teil, Heft 1, Uredinales. (PDF; 1,8 MB).  Use  Early spring greens and buds of Caltha palustris are edible when cooked. Young leaves or buds should be submerged a few times in fresh boiling water until barely tender, cut into bite-sized pieces, lightly salted, and served with melted butter and vinegar. Very young flowerbuds have been prepared like capers and used as a spice. The common marsh marigold is planted as an ornamental throughout temperate regions in the world, and sometimes recommended for low maintenance wildlife gardens. The double-flowered cultivar 'Flore Pleno' has won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  Toxicology  Caltha contains several active substances of which the most important from a toxicological point of view is protoanemonin. Larger quantities of the plant may cause convulsions, burning of the throat, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, dizziness and fainting. Contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the juices can cause blistering or inflammation, and gastric illness if ingested. Younger parts seem to contain less toxics and heating breaks these substances down. Small amounts of Caltha in hay do not cause problems when fed to husbandry, but larger quantities lead to gastric illness. Notes References *Clapham, A. R., Tutin, T. G., and Warburg, E.

He was one of the most famous Portuguese composers of the time, together with Filipe de Magalh√£es, Manuel Cardoso, composers who all began their academic studies as students of Manuel Mendes. Along with John IV, King of Portugal, they represent the \\"golden age\\" of Portuguese polyphony. Life Details of his life are sparse. He was born in Alc√°√ßovas, in Alentejo, southern Portugal. He is known to have been a choir boy at √âvora where he subsequently studied with Manuel Mendes. His first position was as mestre de capela of the cathedral of √âvora; sometime before 1589, he became maestro di cappella at the Hospital Real, Lisbon. By 1591 he was appointed as mestre de capela at the cathedral in Lisbon, a position he held till 1639. This was the most prestigious musical appointment in the country. He also served as director of the Seminar of S√£o Bartolomeu, and was also a professor of music at the 'Col√©gio do Claustro da S√©' (College at the Holy See Cloisters) in Lisbon, where he taught Manuel Machado. While chronologically his life overlapped with the beginning of the Baroque music era, he was a rather conservative composer who followed the techniques of the Renaissance masters of the previous generation. Palestrina's polyphonic style played a crucial role in his compositions throughout his life. Recordings *Duarte L√¥bo, Requiem. The Tallis Scholars, Peter Phillips.

Galactorrhea is reported to occur in 5‚Äì32% of women. Much of the difference in reported incidence can be attributed to different definitions of galactorrhea. Although frequently benign, it may be caused by serious underlying conditions and should be properly investigated. Galactorrhea also occurs in males, newborn infants and adolescents of both sexes. Causes Galactorrhea can take place as a result of dysregulation of certain hormones. Hormonal causes most frequently associated with galactorrhea are hyperprolactinemia and thyroid conditions with elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyrotropin- releasing hormone (TRH). No obvious cause is found in about 50% of cases. Lactation requires the presence of prolactin, and the evaluation of galactorrhea includes eliciting a history for various medications or foods (methyldopa, opioids, antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as licorice) and for behavioral causes (stress, and breast and chest wall stimulation), as well as evaluation for pregnancy, pituitary adenomas (with overproduction of prolactin or compression of the pituitary stalk), and hypothyroidism. Adenomas of the anterior pituitary are most often prolactinomas. Overproduction of prolactin leads to cessation of menstrual periods and infertility, which may be a diagnostic clue. Galactorrhea may also be caused by hormonal imbalances owing to birth control pills. Galactorrhea is also a side effect associated with the use of the second-generation H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine (Tagamet). Galactorrhea can also be caused by antipsychotics that cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking dopamine receptors responsible for control of prolactin release. Of these, risperidone is the most notorious for causing this complication. Case reports suggest proton-pump inhibitors have been shown to cause galactorrhea.

They are recognized as an official nationality by the Government of Nepal. In the Indian Terai, they live foremost in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Government of India recognizes the Tharu people as a scheduled tribe. The word ‡§•‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ç thƒÅru is thought to be derived from sthavir meaning follower of Theravada Buddhism.  Distribution  Map showing area inhabited by Tharu people in dark green As of 2011, the Tharu population of Nepal was censused at 1,737,470 people, or 6.6% of the total population. In 2009, the majority of Tharu people were estimated to live in Nepal. There are several endogamous sub-groups of Tharu that are scattered over most of the Terai: * Rana Tharu in the Kailali and Kanchanpur Districts of the far western Nepal Terai; also in India, in Udham Singh Nagar district, Uttarakhand and Kheri district in Uttar Pradesh. Rana Tharu claim Rajput origin. * Kathariya Tharu mostly in Kailali District and in India; * Sonha Tharu in Surkhet District; * Dangaura Tharu in the western Terai: Dang-Deukhuri, Banke, Bardia, Kailali, Kanchanpur, Rupandehi and Kapilvastu Districts; * Chitwan Tharu in central Terai: Sindhuli, Chitwan and Nawalparasi Districts; * Kochila Tharu in eastern Terai: Saptari, Bara, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Mahottari and Udayapur districts; * Danuwar in eastern Terai: Udayapur, Saptari and Morang Districts; *Lampucchwa Tharu in Morang and Sunsari District. Smaller numbers of Tharu people reside in the adjacent Indian districts Champaran of Bihar, Gorakhpur, Basti and Gonda districts in Uttar Pradesh and Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand. In 2001, Tharu people were the largest of five scheduled tribes in Uttarakhand, with a population of 256,129 accounting for 33.4% of all scheduled tribes. In the same year, they constituted 77.4% of the total tribal population of Uttar Pradesh with a population of 83,544. Genetics Genetic studies on Y-DNA of Tharu people from two villages in Chitwan district and one in Morang district revealed a high presence of Haplogroup O-M117 (33.3%) followed by Haplogroup H (Y-DNA) (25.7%), Haplogroup J-M172 (9.9%), Haplogroup R1a (8.8%), Haplogroup R2 (4.7%), haplogroup J-M172 (4.1%), haplogroup D-M174 (3.5%), Haplogroup L-M20 (2.3%), haplogroup O-K18 (2.3%), haplogroup E-M35 (1.8%), haplogroup O-M122 (1.2%), haplogroup Q-M242 (1.2%), Haplogroup C-M130 (0.6%), and haplogroup K-M9 (0.6%). Genetic studies on mtDNA of various Tharus shows South Asian maternal mtDNA haplogroups reaches from 34.2% to 67.5% in the Tharu while for East Asian it reaches from 32.5% to 68.4%, depending on the Tharu's group studied. = Resistance to malaria = The Tharu are famous for their ability to survive in the malarial parts of the Terai that were deadly to outsiders. Contemporary medical research comparing Tharu with other ethnic groups living nearby found an incidence of malaria nearly seven times lower among Tharu. The researchers believed such a large difference pointed to genetic factors rather than behavioural or dietary differences. This was confirmed by follow-up investigation finding genes for thalassemia in nearly all Tharu studied. History The origin of the Tharu people is not clear but surrounded by myths and oral tradition. The Rana Tharus claim to be of Rajput origin and to have migrated from the Thar Desert to Nepal's Far Western Terai region. Tharu people farther east claim to be descendants of the ≈öƒÅkya and Koliya peoples living in Kapilvastu. According to Alberuni, Tharu people have been living in the eastern Terai since at least the 10th century. =Modern history (1700‚Äì1990)= Following the unification of Nepal in the late 18th century, members of the ruling families received land grants in the Terai and were entitled to collect revenue from those who cultivated the land. Tharu people became bonded labourers, a system also known as Kamaiya. In 1854, Jung Bahadur Rana enforced the so-called Muluki Ain, a General Code, in which both Hindu and non-Hindu castes were classified based on their habits of food and drink. Tharu people were categorized as \\"Paani Chalne Masinya Matwali\\" (touchable enslavable alcohol drinking group) together with several other ethnic minorities. In the late 1950s, the World Health Organization supported the Nepalese government in eradicating malaria in the forests of the central Terai. Following the malaria eradication program using DDT in the 1960s, a large and heterogeneous non-Tharu population from the Nepali hills, Bhutan, Sikkim and India settled in the region. In the western Terai, many Tharu families lost the land, which they used to cultivate, to these immigrants and were forced to work as Kamaiya. When the first protected areas were established in Chitwan, Tharu communities were forced to relocate from their traditional lands. They were denied any right to own land and thus forced into a situation of landlessness and poverty. When the Chitwan National Park was designated, Nepalese soldiers destroyed the villages located inside the national park, burned down houses, and beat the people who tried to plough their fields. Some threatened Tharu people at gun point to leave. =Recent history (1990‚Äìpresent)= After the overthrow of the Panchayat system in Nepal in 1990, the Tharu ethnic association Tharu Kalyankari Sabha joined the umbrella organisation of ethnic groups, a predecessor of the Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities. In July 2000, the Government of Nepal outlawed the practice of bonded labour prevalent under the Kamaiya system, prohibiting anyone from employing any person as a bonded labourer, and declared that the act of making one work as a bonded labourer is illegal. Though democracy has been reinstated in the country, the Tharu community has called for a more inclusive democracy as they are fearful of remaining an underprivileged group. Culture Tharu village near Bardia National Park A Tharu man Wax statues of Tharu people in Tharu Museum, Chitwan The Tharu people themselves say that they are a people of the forest. In Chitwan, they have lived in the forests for hundreds of years practicing a short fallow shifting cultivation. They plant rice, wheat, mustard, corn and lentils, but also collect forest products such as wild fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants and materials to build their houses; hunt deer, rabbit and wild boar, and go fishing in the rivers and oxbow lakes. The Tharus never went abroad for employment ‚Äì a life that kept them isolated in their own localities. In this isolation they developed a unique culture free from the influence of adjacent India, or from the mountain groups of Nepal. The most striking aspects of their environment are the decorated rice containers, colorfully painted verandahs and outer walls of their homes using only available materials like clay, mud, dung and grass. Much of the rich design is rooted in devotional activities and passed on from one generation to the next, occasionally introducing contemporary elements such as a bus or an airplane. =Language= Tharu communities in different parts of Nepal and India do not share the same language. Several speak various endemic Tharu languages. In western Nepal and adjacent parts of India, Tharus speak variants of Hindi, Urdu and Awadhi. In and near central Nepal, they speak a variant of Bhojpuri. In eastern Nepal, they speak a variant of Maithili. More standard versions of these dialects are widely spoken by non- Tharu neighbors in the same areas so that there are no important linguistic barriers between Tharus and their neighbors. However, there are linguistic barriers between these dialects standing in the way of communication between Tharus from different regions. =Household structure= In the western Terai, Rana Tharu traditionally live in Badaghar called longhouses with big families of up to 31 members from four generations and between one and eight married couples. The household members pool their labour force, contribute their income, share the expenditure and use one kitchen. The eldest male person in charge of Badaghar households and associated land holdings is called Mukhiya. He assigns tasks to family members, is responsible for the family's social activities and has to report income and expenditures annually to the family. When families were forced to resettle, some of these Badaghar households broke up into smaller units of up to six households. =Social structure= Tharu people in Rajapur, Nepal are either landholders, cultivate land on a sharecropping basis or are landless agricultural labourers. Tharus from the mid west and far west of Nepal have been practicing the Badghar system, where a Badghar is elected chief of a village or a small group of villages for a year. The election generally takes place in January or February after celebrating the Maghi Festival and after completing major farming activities. In most cases, each household in the village which engages in farming has one voting right for electing a Badghar. Thus the election is based on a count of households count rather than a headcount. The role of the Badghar is to work for the welfare of the village. The Badghar direct the villagers to repair canals or streets when needed. They also oversee and manages the cultural traditions of the villages. They have an authority of punishing those who do not follow their orders or who go against the welfare of the village. Generally the Badghar has a Chaukidar to help him. With the consent of the villagers the Badghar may appoint a \\"Guruwa\\" who is the medic and chief priest of the village. Tharu people are mainly involved in farming, thus irrigating fields is important. Tharus in western Nepal built canals that irrigate thousands of hectares of land. Hundreds of years ago, without using any sophisticated tools, they built hundreds of kilometers of irrigation canals in Nepal's Kailali and Bardiya districts. These canals are used by several villages. Its water and diversion works need to be managed fairly. For this purpose, the Badghars of different villages elect a person for the position of Chaudhary to manage a canal system. When needed, the Chaudhary orders the Badghars to send people to repair or build the canals. In most cases the Badghars and Chaudharis are unpaid leaders of the community. However, they are exempt from compulsory physical labor for the betterment of the society. As a token of respect, the community members may also help them in farming for a day free of cost. =Marriage system= Traditionally, Rana Tharus practice arranged marriages, which parents often arrange already during the couple's childhood. The wedding ceremony is held when the bride and groom reach marriable age. The ceremony lasts several days, involving all the relatives of the two families. It is also a custom to arrange the marriage of a daughter in exchange for getting a bride for a son. Parents give particular attention to the working capacity of the groom and bride, rather than the economic situation of the in-law family. Polygamous marriages are also customary among Tharu people, with rich land holders marrying between two and five women. =Religion= The spiritual beliefs and moral values of the Tharu people are closely linked to the natural environment. The pantheon of their gods comprises a large number of deities that live in the forest. They are asked for support before entering the forest. =Cuisine= Tharu people of Nepal have different and special food items like Bagiya or Dhikri and ghonghi, an edible snail collected in water bodies. Dhikri is made of rice flour. The dough from the rice flour is given different shapes ‚Äì many are stick-like but some are also given the shapes of birds, fish and animals. It is cooked over steam and eaten together with chutney or curry. The ghonghi are left overnight so that all the gooey material inside them comes out. Their tail end is cut so that it is easier to suck out the meat from the shell. They are boiled and later cooked like curry adding spices like coriander, chilies, garlic and onions.

Selfridge received his Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of California, Los Angeles under the supervision of Theodore Motzkin. In 1962, he proved that 78,557 is a Sierpinski number; he showed that, when k = 78,557, all numbers of the form k2n + 1 have a factor in the covering set {3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 73}. Five years later, he and Sierpi≈Ñski proposed the conjecture that 78,557 is the smallest Sierpinski number, and thus the answer to the Sierpinski problem. A distributed computing project called Seventeen or Bust is currently trying to prove this statement, only five of the original seventeen possibilities remain. In 1964, Selfridge and Alexander Hurwitz proved that the 14th Fermat number 2^{2^{14}} + 1 was composite. However, their proof did not provide a factor. It was not until 2010 that the first factor of the 14th Fermat number was found. In 1975 John Brillhart, Derrick Henry Lehmer and Selfridge developed a method of proving the primality of p given only partial factorizations of p ‚àí 1 and p + 1\\\\. Together with Samuel Wagstaff they also all participated in the Cunningham project. Together with Paul Erd≈ës, Selfridge solved a 150-year-old problem, proving that the product of consecutive numbers is never a power. It took them many years to find the proof and John made extensive use of computers, but the final version of the proof requires only a modest amount of computation, namely evaluating an easily computed function f(n) for 30,000 consecutive values of n. Selfridge suffered from writer's block and paid a former student to write up the result, even though it is only two pages long. As a mathematician, Selfridge was one of the most effective number theorists with a computer. He also had a way with words. On the occasion that another computational number theorist, Samuel Wagstaff, was lecturing at the semiannual Bloomington Illinois Number Theory Conference on his computer investigations into Fermat's Last Theorem, someone a little too pointedly asked him what methods he was using and kept insisting on an answer. Wagstaff stood there like a deer blinded in headlights, totally at a loss what to say, until Selfridge helped him out. \\"He used the principle of computer fooling-aroundedness.\\" Wagstaff said later that you probably wouldn't want to use that phrase in a research proposal asking for funding, such as an NSF proposal. Selfridge also developed the Selfridge‚ÄìConway discrete procedure for creating an envy-free cake-cutting among three people. Selfridge developed this in 1960, and John Conway independently discovered it in 1993. Neither of them ever published the result, but Richard Guy told many people Selfridge's solution in the 1960s, and it was eventually attributed to the two of them in a number of books and articles. Selfridge served on the faculties of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Northern Illinois University from 1971 to 1991 (retirement), chairing the Department of Mathematical Sciences 1972‚Äì1976 and 1986‚Äì1990. He was executive editor of Mathematical Reviews from 1978 to 1986, overseeing the computerization of its operations . He was a founder of the Number Theory Foundation , which has named its Selfridge prize in his honour. Selfridge's conjecture about Fermat numbers Selfridge made the following conjecture about the Fermat numbers Fn = 22n \\\\+ 1 . Let g(n) be the number of distinct prime factors of Fn . As to 2016, g(n) is known only up to n = 11, and it is monotonic. Selfridge conjectured that contrary to appearances, g(n) is NOT monotonic. In support of his conjecture he showed: a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for its truth is the existence of another Fermat prime beyond the five known (3, 5, 17, 257, 65537).Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective, Richard Crandall and Carl Pomerance, Second edition, Springer, 2011 Look up Selfridge's Conjecture in the Index. Selfridge's conjecture about primality testing This conjecture is also called the PSW conjecture, after Selfridge, Carl Pomerance, and Samuel Wagstaff. Let p be an odd number, with p ‚â° ¬± 2 (mod 5). Selfridge conjectured that if * 2p‚àí1 ‚â° 1 (mod p) and at the same time * fp+1 ‚â° 0 (mod p), where fk is the kth Fibonacci number, then p is a prime number, and he offered $500 for an example disproving this. He also offered $20 for a proof that the conjecture was true. The Number Theory Foundation will now cover this prize. An example will actually yield you $620 because Samuel Wagstaff offers $100 for an example or a proof, and Carl Pomerance offers $20 for an example and $500 for a proof. Selfridge requires that a factorization be supplied, but Pomerance does not. The conjecture was still open August 23, 2015. The related test that fp‚àí1 ‚â° 0 (mod p) for p ‚â° ¬±1 (mod 5) is false and has e.g. a 6-digit counterexample.According to an email from Pomerance.Carl Pomerance, Richard Crandall, Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective, Second Edition, p. 168, Springer Verlag, 2005. The smallest counterexample for +1 (mod 5) is 6601 = 7 √ó 23 √ó 41 and the smallest for ‚àí1 (mod 5) is 30889 = 17 √ó 23 √ó 79. It should be known that a heuristic by Pomerance may show this conjecture is false (and therefore, a counterexample should exist).

Played by Kevin Murphy (who also voiced and operated robot Tom Servo on the show), Bobo is a sapient, speaking gorilla from the year 2525, an homage to the film Planet of the Apes. According to his family tree, he is the son of Coco and heir to the great lineage of Godo, Mogo and Chim-Chim. Professor Bobo is a curious mixture of eminent scientist, descended from a long line of supposedly respected apes, and of sensory-driven primate, often regressing to more primitive desires and actions. In the first three shows of Season 8, he leads an ape laboratory directed by the \\"Lawgiver\\" (Planet of the Apes) to continue the movie-watching \\"experiments\\" on Mike Nelson and his robots, again trapped in the Satellite of Love. In subsequent shows, Bobo travels with the Lawgiver, who turns out to be Pearl Forrester (inheriting the mad scientist role from her son, Dr. Clayton Forrester). Bobo ultimately becomes one of her henchmen after his planet is destroyed when Mike Nelson helps the apes and their new mutant friends activate an atomic bomb (a reference to PotA sequel Beneath the Planet of the Apes). Despite his title of \\"Professor\\", Bobo demonstrated remarkably little intelligence after leaving Earth of 2525. He was revealed to be illiterate (which may apply only to English and not the ape language), and in episode #820: Space Mutiny, he inadvertently obstructed Pearl's attempts to free the \\"Mads\\" from captivity in Neronian Rome, and starts the Great Fire of Rome by knocking over a lamp in his haste to steal a wheel of cheese. In the final episode (#1013 Danger: Diabolik), he boasted of his new \\"job\\" at a zoo, possibly unaware of his future role as a specimen.

He is played by Bill Corbett, and appears in the eighth through eleventh seasons of the series. Observer is a hyperintelligent, psychic alien from a planet of fellow aliens who confusingly all share the name \\"Observer\\" (the other two who appear in the series are played by Michael J. Nelson and Paul Chaplin). Supposedly, the Observers \\"evolved\\" beyond bodies into dark-green brains, contained in large Petri dishes (not unlike the Providers in the Star Trek episode \\"The Gamesters of Triskelion\\"). They are carried around by humanoid host bodies (controllable over a distance of up to 50 yards), rendering their abandonment of their original bodies rather pointless. (As the robot Gypsy points out, \\"Wouldn't it be more convenient to just keep your brains in your heads?\\") Thus Observer is, technically, only the brain which is being carried by the host body, but for all intents and purposes, he is considered a humanoid with brain separated from body. Observer joins the mad scientists (\\"The Mads\\") after his planet is accidentally destroyed by Mike Nelson. Like his colleagues Professor Bobo (Kevin Murphy) and Pearl Forrester (Mary Jo Pehl), Brain Guy is deeply dysfunctional. Unlike Bobo and Pearl, Brain Guy apparently has a considerable social and sexual life once the Mads returns to Earth in Seasons 9 and 10. He is also said to have, as Professor Bobo put it, \\"B.O.\\" (body odor). Observer denies this, claiming that he doesn't have a body, although eventually he gives himself a sniff and admits that he does, in fact, stink. After Observer joins the Mads, he usually ends up being the one who sends the movies to the Satellite of Love via his psychic abilities. Observer, like his fellow Observers, claims to be omnipotent and omniscient, much like Q and his people from Star Trek: The Next Generation, but frequently fails to demonstrate these supposed abilities (he once stated that he was \\"not that omnipotent\\"). In one of his early appearances (Episode #806, The Undead), before his homeworld is accidentally destroyed by Mike Nelson, his fellow Observers test the rest of the cast to see if any of them deserve the right to become part of their kind. He is surprised when Tom Servo scores higher than him, leading to Observer being painfully punished. Exposure to Pearl's autocratic manner appears to further degrade his powers over the course of the show, to the point that when Observer tries to punish Mike horribly, he only sends him a necktie. (\\"Don't you see what a terrible gift that is?\\") In the final episode, #1013, Danger: Diabolik, Pearl's playful dousing of his brain in Mountain Dew temporarily interferes with his speech and disables his gifts, allowing the Satellite of Love to crash to Earth. As the Mads pack up their things before leaving Castle Forrester, the Forrester family's ancestral home, Observer initially agrees with Pearl that he must have \\"lots of stuff goin‚Äô on\\" after they go their separate ways, but finally admits that he'll probably \\"have to take that position as the all-knowing eternal and universal consciousness over on Rylos 14\\".

The founder of the Williams Formula One team, he was team principal until September 2020.  Early life  Frank Williams was born in South Shields, South Tyneside. At the time, his father served as an active Royal Air Force officer, while his mother worked in special education ‚Äì initially as a teacher and later as headmistress. Williams was partly raised by his maternal aunt and uncle in Jarrow, after the breakdown of his parents' marriage. He subsequently spent much of his later childhood at a private, fee-paying boarding school, St Joseph's College, Dumfries, Scotland. In the late 1950s, a friend gave Williams a ride in his Jaguar XK150, which immediately served to catalyse his interest in fast cars.Matt Jeffery, Formula 1 Chronicles: Frank Williams, Highandbye.com, 21 June 2012  Motorsports career  After a brief career as a driver and mechanic, Williams founded Frank Williams Racing Cars in 1966, funded by his work as a travelling grocery salesman. He ran drivers‚Äîincluding Piers Courage‚Äîfor several years in Formula Two and Formula Three. Williams purchased a Brabham Formula One chassis, which Courage drove throughout the 1969 Formula One season, twice finishing in second place.People: Sir Frank Williams, Grandprix.com In 1970, Williams undertook a brief partnership with Alejandro de Tomaso. After the death of Courage at the Dutch Grand Prix that year, Williams's relationship with de Tomaso ended. In 1971, he raced Henri Pescarolo with a chassis purchased from March Engineering; 1972 saw the first F1 car built by the Williams works, the Politoys FX3 designed by Len Bailey. Pescarolo crashed and destroyed it at its first race. Williams, short on cash and conducting team business from a telephone box after being disconnected for unpaid bills, looked to Marlboro and Iso Rivolta, an Italian car company, for sponsorship. Though they pledged their support, they did not come through in time. In 1976, Williams took on a partner in Canadian oil magnate Walter Wolf. Though the team continued functioning, it no longer belonged to Williams and he left in 1977, along with one of his employees, engineer Patrick Head. The two acquired an empty carpet warehouse in Didcot, Oxfordshire, and announced the formation of Williams Grand Prix Engineering. This same team and partnership still compete in Formula One. They are currently based just outside of Grove, Oxfordshire. The team's first win came when Clay Regazzoni drove the Cosworth-powered Williams FW07 to victory at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Their first Drivers' Championship and Constructors' Championship both came in 1980, with the Australian Alan Jones winning the drivers' title. Between 1981 and 1997, the team won six more drivers' championships and eight more constructors' championships. In May 1994, following the death of Ayrton Senna in the Williams FW16 at Imola, Williams was charged with manslaughter in Italy, but was acquitted after several years. Since Senna's death, every chassis since the Williams FW17 has carried a tribute in the form of a small Senna logo on its front wing supports, or nearby. In March 2012, Williams announced he would be stepping down from the board of Williams F1 and would be replaced by his daughter Claire Williams, although he would still remain with the team in the role of team principal. Williams ceased to have any involvement with the sale of Williams F1 team in September 2020.  Personal life  Williams met Virginia Berry in 1967. They married in 1974. They had two sons, Jonathan and Jamie, and a daughter, Claire Williams (who would go on to become the deputy team principal of Frank's future Formula One team Williams Grand Prix Engineering). Williams has used a wheelchair since a car accident in France, on 8 March 1986, rendered him tetraplegic. He was driving with team sponsorship manager Peter Windsor in a rented Ford Sierra from the Paul Ricard Circuit to Nice C√¥te d'Azur Airport when the incident happened. Williams had been at the circuit to watch the testing of the team's new Williams FW11, but as a keen long distance runner, he was returning to the airport following the trials because he wished to compete in a fun run in London the next day. During the drive to the airport, Williams lost control of the rental car on a slight left hand kink in the road, causing it to leave the highway. An drop between the road and a field caused the car to roll onto the driver's side. Williams suffered a spinal fracture between the fourth and fifth vertebra after being pressed between his seat and the crushed roof. Windsor sustained only minor injuries. Virginia wrote an autobiographical book that was published in 1991, A Different Kind of Life, in which she describes her experiences in the Formula One team's formative years as well as her husband's near-fatal accident. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2010, and died on 7 March 2013, at the age of 66.  Honours  Williams was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth in 1986, and received a knighthood in 1999. He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour by France, for his work on Renault F1's engines. Williams received the Wheatcroft Trophy in 2008, in recognition of his significant contributions to motorsports. In 2010, he was awarded the Helen Rollason Award for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards.Sir Frank Williams honoured at BBC SPOTY, The F1 Times In 2012, a new road in Didcot, Oxfordshire, was named \\"Sir Frank Williams Avenue.\\"  Footnotes   External links  * Profile of Sir Frank Williams * All Rise for the Honourable Sir Frank by Roger Horton (1999) * Profile on WilliamsF1 official team website 1942 births Chevaliers of the L√©gion d'honneur Commanders of the Order of the British Empire English businesspeople English motorsport people English Roman Catholics Formula One people Formula One team owners Knights Bachelor Living people People educated at St Joseph's College, Dumfries People from Jarrow People in sports awarded knighthoods People with tetraplegia Segrave Trophy recipients ","title":"Frank Williams (Formula One)"},{"id":"995108","text":"Methyldopa, sold under the brand name Aldomet among others, is a medication used for high blood pressure. It is one of the preferred treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy. For other types of high blood pressure including very high blood pressure resulting in symptoms other medications are typically preferred. It can be given by mouth or injection into a vein. Onset of effects is around 5 hours and they last about a day. Common side effects include sleepiness. More severe side effects include red blood cell breakdown, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Methyldopa is in the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist family of medication. It works by stimulating the brain to decrease the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Methyldopa was discovered in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.  Medical uses  Methyldopa is used in the clinical treatment of the following disorders: * Hypertension (or high blood pressure) * Gestational hypertension (or pregnancy-induced hypertension) and pre-eclampsia  Side effects  Methyldopa is capable of inducing a number of adverse side effects, which range from mild to severe. Nevertheless, they are generally mild when the dose is less than 1 gram per day. Side effects may include: * Psychological ** Depression or even suicidal ideation, as well as nightmares ** Apathy or anhedonia, as well as dysphoria ** Anxiety, especially of the social anxiety variant ** Decreased alertness, awareness, and wakefulness ** Impaired attention, focus, and concentration ** Decreased desire, drive, and motivation ** Fatigue or lethargy or malaise or lassitude ** Sedation or drowsiness or somnolence or sleepiness ** Agitation or restlessness ** Cognitive and memory impairment ** Derealization or depersonalization, as well as mild psychosis ** Sexual dysfunction including impaired libido, desire, and drive * Physiological ** Dizziness, lightheadedness, or vertigo ** Miosis or pupil constriction ** Xerostomia or dry mouth ** Gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea or constipation ** Headache or migraine ** Myalgia or muscle aches, arthralgia or joint pain, or paresthesia (\\"pins and needles\\") ** Restless legs syndrome (RLS) ** Parkinsonian symptoms such as muscle tremors, rigidity, hypokinesia, or balance or postural instability ** Akathisia, ataxia, dyskinesia as well as even tardive dyskinesia, or dystonia ** Bell's palsy or facial paralysis ** Sexual dysfunction consisting of impaired erectile dysfunction or anorgasmia ** Hyperprolactinemia or excess prolactin, gynecomastia/breast enlargement in males, or amenorrhoea or absence of menstrual cycles in females ** Bradycardia or decreased heart rate ** Hypotension or decreased blood pressure (though this may also be considered a therapeutic benefit) ** Orthostatic hypotension (also known as postural hypotension) ** Hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, or liver dysfunction or damage ** Pancreatitis or inflammation of the pancreas ** Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia or deficiency in red blood cells (RBCs) ** Myelotoxicity or bone marrow suppression, potentially leading to thrombocytopenia or blood platelet deficiency or leukopenia or white blood cell (WBC) deficiency ** Hypersensitivity such as lupus erythematosus, myocarditis, or pericarditis ** Lichenoid reactions such as skin lesions or rashes ** Pallor = Rebound/withdrawal = Rebound hypertension via withdrawal on account of tolerance upon the abrupt discontinuation of methyldopa has been reported.Methyldopa (PIM 342)  Mechanism of action  The mechanism of action of methyldopa is not fully clear. Although it is a centrally acting sympathomimetic, it does not block reuptake or transporters. It may reduce the dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission in the peripheral nervous system and it indirectly affects norepinephrine (noradrenaline) synthesis. The S-enantiomer of methyldopa is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (LAAD), which converts L-DOPA into dopamine. L-DOPA can cross the blood brain barrier and thus methyldopa may have similar effects. LAAD converts it into alpha-methyldopamine, a false prescursor to norepinephrine, which in turn reduces synthesis of norepinephrine in the vesicles. Dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) converts alpha-methyldopamine into alpha-methylnorepinephrine, which is an agonist of the presynaptic Œ±2-adrenergic receptor causing inhibition of neurotransmitter release.  Pharmacokinetics  Methyldopa exhibits variable absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized in the liver and intestines and is excreted in urine.  History  When methyldopa was first introduced, it was the mainstay of antihypertensive treatment, but its use has declined on account of relatively severe adverse side effects, with increased use of other safer and more tolerable agents such as alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers.

The school is an affiliate of the eight-member Concordia University System operated by the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod. The university is a coeducational institution accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, offering 78 undergraduate majors and minors, 17 graduate programs, eight accelerated adult education programs, and three doctoral/professional programs, as well as accelerated evening and e-learning programs. Doctoral degrees are offered in pharmacy, physical therapy, and nursing practice. CUW also has 10 classroom centers providing community outreach with full adult education and post-graduate programs. CUW's School of Pharmacy is one of three pharmacy schools in Wisconsin‚Äîthe others being University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and Medical College of Wisconsin. The university is organized into five schools or colleges: the School of Education, the School of Business and Legal Studies, the School of Human Services, the School of Arts and Sciences, and the School of Adult and Continuing Education. In 2013, Concordia University Ann Arbor (CUAA) merged with Concordia University Wisconsin. This merger was due to low enrollment and financial troubles at the Ann Arbor campus. CUW became the administration for both campuses, with Ann Arbor considered a satellite campus to the Mequon campus. By 2018, CUAA had nearly doubled in enrollment, successfully started a School of Nursing, built a new football stadium, and completed extensive renovations to 75% of the classroom buildings. Campus The university is located at 12800 North Lake Shore Drive in Mequon, Wisconsin, a city north of Milwaukee of just over 23,000 citizens. The university owns a campus with over of indoor walkways, better known as \\"tunnels\\". These \\"tunnels\\" connect all academic and residence halls on campus except for the Concordia Center for Environmental Stewardship. The university and its 10 Concordia Centers are home to more than 7,900 undergraduate and graduate, traditional, as well as non-traditional students from 46 states and 34 countries. The university offers 70 undergraduate majors, 22 master's degree programs, and doctoral degrees in Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, and Nursing Practice. There are also a variety of accelerated evening and e-learning programs. History Concordia was opened in 1881 at Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church in downtown Milwaukee. Classes were taught in the basement of the building, with only 13 students in attendance. One year later, the college, known then as Concordia College, purchased nearby land to erect a permanent facility. The college was located between 31st and 33rd Streets and State Street and Highland Boulevard in Milwaukee until 1983. The campus is now owned and operated by the Forest County Potawatomi Community (the owners of the Potawatomi Hotel & Casino). For the first 83 years, from its inception to 1964, the college featured a classical education with a pre-theology emphasis. Its main mission was to prepare young men for pastoral careers in the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod. Originally, graduates matriculated to Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri for an additional four years of divinity studies, leading to ordination within the Lutheran Church. Prior to the fall of 1964, the combination high school and junior college operated as a male-only institution. Even after women students were accepted in the junior college program for the first time that fall, the high school and the pre-seminary program continued to restrict admissions to men. =Growth= Under the direction of President Wilbert Rosin, the college requested four-year institution status from the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod for its programs, and in 1978 the request was approved. Dr. R. John Buuck became president in 1979. In 1982, the former campus of the School Sisters of Notre Dame in Mequon, Wisconsin was purchased and now has become the permanent home of CUW. In 1996, the original Milwaukee campus was turned over to the Native American Educational System of Wisconsin, which teaches tribal youth about their culture and language as the Indian Community School of Milwaukee. As construction on the modern campus continued throughout the 1980s, the college petitioned its board of regents for full university status on August 27, 1989, and the request was approved for the fall 1990 term, making it the first among the ten Concordia University System campuses to achieve that standing. Subsequently, during his 17-year tenure, President R. John Buuck lead the university to unprecedented growth. With the introduction of programs such as business, nursing, adult education, physical therapy, occupational therapy etc., the university grew rapidly becoming the largest Lutheran college and university in North America in 1996. The past decade CUW has undergone much constructional change with the addition of many new buildings. In the Summer of 2011, construction for a School of Pharmacy building was completed. Concordia University Wisconsin's School of Pharmacy program was launched in the fall of 2010 and is a four-year professional pharmacy program designed to prepare students for a variety of careers within the pharmacy profession. By adding a School of Pharmacy, CUW has become one of three schools in the state of Wisconsin to offer a Pharm.D. degree. The building includes many amenities: clinical practice labs to develop patient care skills, state-of-the-art educational technologies, faculty research space, lecture halls, and faculty offices. =Presidents= * Christoph Henry Loeber ‚Äì installed 1885 * Max Albrecht ‚Äì installed 1893 * G.

Adult education programs were also expanded, thereby topping the list of the largest such programs in higher education for the Lutheran Church. CUW's enrollment makes it the largest Lutheran university in the United States. Faculty Student/Faculty ratio: 13 to 1 Average class size: 18 Full-time faculty with terminal degree: 74.2% Student media Concordia has several student publications, including the official student newspaper, The Beacon, founded in 1984. Prior to that, papers such as The Courier made up the student news publications. An underground publication at Concordia is The Shadow, which contains humorous fictional stories and is distributed by secret editorial staff. It is in its third incarnation, following in the footsteps of the original, but renamed as The Shadow Reborn. Athletics Concordia Wisconsin teams participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III and are members of the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference (NACC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, shooting, soccer, tennis, track & field and wrestling; women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, shooting, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field, volleyball and field hockey. In April 2012, CUW opened its new baseball field, Kapco Park. The field is home to both CUW's men's baseball and the Lakeshore Chinooks, a local minor league baseball team part-owned by Robin Yount and Bob Uecker. Kapco Park has the maximum capacity for 3,000 fans in various seating areas throughout the facility including reserved seats, fan decks, general admission and grass seating, all with beautiful views of Lake Michigan. This ballpark has a synthetic turf field, except the pitchers mound, for consistent play throughout the year. It also has a fully functioning press box, dugouts, concession area and restrooms. The park sits on the northeast corner of Concordia University Wisconsin, located on the shores of Lake Michigan. In 2013, CUW announced the addition of Acrobatics and Tumbling, the university's 24th sport with a competitive championship. CUW is expected to begin its first season of competition during the spring of 2015 with an approximate roster of 30-40 student-athletes. The official competition season is February‚ÄìApril. The Falcons will become the 12th school to sponsor the emerging sport, in association with the National Collegiate Acrobatics & Tumbling Association. =Mascot= CUW is represented by Freddy the Falcon. The school's athletic colors are royal blue, white, and grey. Student life =Clubs and organizations= The university has more than 70 student organizations in various fields of interest. Student government CUW's student government association (SGA) oversees all student organization on campus. It is made up of resident senators from each dormitory, commuter senators who live off campus, organization senators who represent campus organizations, and the executive board. SGA receives its funding from the $40 Student Government Program fee that full-time students pay. SGA works with the students, faculty, campus ministry, and the administration to represent the students in all aspects of life at Concordia. Campus activities The CUW Campus Activities Board coordinates, markets, and facilitates activities for the entire campus throughout the year. These events include Homecoming, An Evening at the Lounge, Casino Night, Winterfest, and many new and traditional events.

Also known as , it is one of the most famous Shinto shrines in the city. The shrine honors the three men who founded the Sens≈ç-ji. Asakusa Shrine is part of a larger grouping of sacred buildings in the area. It can be found on the east side of the Sens≈ç-ji down a street marked by a large stone torii. One of the only two buildings in the area to survive World War II, it is designated an Important Cultural Property due to its long history. History A torii leading the way to Asakusa Shrine An example of the gongen-zukuri style of architecture, Asakusa Shrine was commissioned by Tokugawa Iemitsu and constructed in 1649 during Japan's Edo period. It was constructed in order to honor the three men who established and constructed the Sens≈ç-ji. The legend states that two brothers, fishermen named Hinokuma Hamanari and Hinokuma Takenari, found a bosatsu Kannon statuette caught in a fishing-net in the Sumida River on May 17, 628. The third man, a wealthy landlord named Haji no Matsuchi (Haji no Nakatomo), heard about the discovery and approached the brothers to whom he delivered an impassioned sermon about the Buddha. The brothers were very impressed and subsequently converted to the Buddhist religion. The Kannon statue was consecrated in a small temple by the landlord and the brothers who thereafter devoted their lives to preaching the way of Buddhism. This temple is now known as the Sens≈ç-ji. Asakusa Shrine was built in order to worship these men as deities. The shrine and its surrounding area and buildings have also been the site of many Shinto and Buddhist festivals for centuries. The most important and famous of these festivals is Sanja Matsuri, held in late May. Unlike many other structures in the area, including the Sens≈ç-ji, the shrine (along with the Nitenmon) survived the Tokyo air raids of 1945. Because of this rich history, it was designated an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese Government in 1951.

IUMA is widely recognized as the birthplace of on-line music. IUMA's goal was to help independent artists use the Internet to distribute their music to fans while circumventing the usual distribution model of using a record company. IUMA was started by Rob Lord, Jeff Patterson and Jon Luini from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1993. Alt URL IUMA originally existed as FTP and Gopher sites, before the World Wide Web was widely used. On March 9, 1994 CNN featured IUMA in their \\"Showbiz News\\" segment. In June 1999, IUMA was purchased by EMusic, and moved operations from Santa Cruz to Redwood City, home of the EMusic offices. IUMA provided artists who registered with a free URL and web page. The artists could present their music over the Internet in stream, download, and internet radio format. Further, it provided an easy-to-use home page for the band and the ability to distribute their music with no bandwidth fees. Some of the original file formats used to encode the music were WAV, AIFF and MP2. MP3 was added later as that format became more popular. In 2000, IUMA offered US$5,000 to couples who named their baby \\"Iuma\\". Several families took up the offer. IUMA flourished, hosting events such as \\"Music-o-mania\\", the largest online \\"Battle of the Bands\\" ever held. The winners were given rock star treatment, flown to San Francisco to open for Primus at the Fillmore auditorium. Early in 2006, the IUMA website disappeared from the Internet. The site had already been closed to new submissions since 2001, when EMusic downsized, eliminating most of the IUMA staff. Despite this setback, much of IUMA's core group continued to work on a \\"volunteer\\" basis, in the hopes that IUMA could be resurrected. IUMA was then purchased by Vitaminic, an Italian music company. In late May 2012, Jason Scott Sadofsky (founder of Textfiles.com) announced that much of IUMA's collection has been reposted via the Internet Archive. John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), managed to retrieve the surviving files before its shutdown.

Gallagher, himself a two- time writer for Doctor Who, made the distinction that Eleventh Hour will be \\"science-based,\\" not science fiction or speculative fiction. =Changing crew= Material was added to the scripts by producer Simon Stephenson after the early episodes went into production, and creator Stephen Gallagher left his role on the series because of it.

It can also be adapted to systems under externally-applied fields, and used as a quantitative model for discontinuous (i.e., first-order) transitions. Mean-field formulation (no long-range correlation) Landau was motivated to suggest that the free energy of any system should obey two conditions: *It is analytic. *It obeys the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Given these two conditions, one can write down (in the vicinity of the critical temperature, Tc) a phenomenological expression for the free energy as a Taylor expansion in the order parameter. =Second-order transitions= Sketch of free energy as a function of order parameter \\\\eta Consider a system that breaks some symmetry below a phase transition, which is characterized by an order parameter \\\\eta. This order parameter is a measure of the order before and after a phase transition; the order parameter is often zero above some critical temperature and non-zero below the critical temperature. In a simple ferromagnetic system like the Ising model, the order parameter is characterized by the net magnetization m, which becomes spontaneously non-zero below a critical temperature T_c. In Landau theory, one considers a free energy functional that is an analytic function of the order parameter. In many systems with certain symmetries, the free energy will only be a function of even powers of the order parameter, for which it can be expressed as the series expansion :F(T,\\\\eta) - F_0 = a(T) \\\\eta^2 + \\\\frac{b(T)}{2} \\\\eta^4 + \\\\cdots In general, there are higher order terms present in the free energy, but it is a reasonable approximation to consider the series to fourth order in the order parameter, as long as the order parameter is small. For the system to be thermodynamically stable (that is, the system does not seek an infinite order parameter to minimize the energy), the coefficient of the highest even power of the order parameter must be positive, so b(T)>0. For simplicity, one can assume that b(T) = b_0, a constant, near the critical temperature. Furthermore, since a(T) changes sign above and below the critical temperature, one can likewise expand a(T) \\\\approx a_0 (T-T_c), where it is assumed that a>0 for the high-temperature phase while a<0 for the low-temperature phase, for a transition to occur. With these assumptions, minimizing the free energy with respect to the order parameter requires :\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial \\\\eta} = 2a(T) \\\\eta + 2b(T) \\\\eta^3 = 0 The solution to the order parameter that satisfies this condition is either \\\\eta= 0, or :\\\\eta_0^2 = -\\\\frac{a}{b} = - \\\\frac{a_0}{b_0}(T-T_c) Order parameter and specific heat as a function of temperature It is clear that this solution only exists for T, otherwise \\\\eta= 0 is the only solution. Indeed, \\\\eta= 0 is the minimum solution for T>T_c, but the solution \\\\eta_0 minimizes the free energy for T, and thus is a stable phase. Furthermore, the order parameter follows the relation :\\\\eta(T) \\\\propto \\\\leftT - T_c \\\\right|^{1/2} below the critical temperature, indicating a critical exponent \\\\beta = 1/2 for this Landau mean-theory model. The free- energy will vary as a function of temperature given by :F - F_0 = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\- \\\\dfrac{a_0^2}{2b_0} (T-T_c)^2, & TT_c \\\\end{cases} From the free energy, one can compute the specific heat, :c_p = -T\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 F}{\\\\partial T^2} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{a_0^2}{b_0} T, & TT_c \\\\end{cases} which has a finite jump at the critical temperature of size \\\\Delta c = a_0^2 T_c/b_0. This finite jump is therefore not associated with a discontinuity that would occur if the system absorbed latent heat, since T_c \\\\Delta S = 0. It is also noteworthy that the discontinuity in the specific heat is related to the discontinuity in the second derivative of the free energy, which is characteristic of a second-order phase transition. Furthermore, the fact that the specific heat has no divergence or cusp at the critical point indicates its critical exponent for c\\\\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\\\alpha} is \\\\alpha=0. =Applied fields= In many systems, one can consider a perturbing field h that couples linearly to the order parameter. For example, in the case of a classical dipole moment \\\\mu, the energy of the dipole-field system is -\\\\mu B. In the general case, one can assume an energy shift of -\\\\eta h due to the coupling of the order parameter to the applied field h, and the Landau free energy will change as a result: :F(T,\\\\eta) - F_0 = a_0 (T-T_c) \\\\eta^2 + \\\\frac{b_0}{2} \\\\eta^4 - \\\\eta h In this case, the minimization condition is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial \\\\eta} = 2 a(T) \\\\eta + 2b_0 \\\\eta^3 - h = 0 One immediate consequence of this equation and its solution is that, if the applied field is non-zero, then the magnetization is non-zero at any temperature. This implies there is no longer a spontaneous symmetry breaking that occurs at any temperature. Furthermore, some interesting thermodynamic and universal quantities can be obtained this above condition. For example, at the critical temperature where a(T_c)=0, one can find the dependence of the order parameter on the external field: :\\\\eta(T_c) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{h}{2b_0} \\\\right)^{1/3} \\\\propto h^{1/\\\\delta} indicating a critical exponent \\\\delta = 3. Zero-field susceptibility as a function of temperature near the critical temperature Furthermore, from the above condition, it is possible to find the zero-field susceptibility \\\\chi\\\\equiv \\\\partial \\\\eta/\\\\partial h|_{h=0}, which must satisfy :0 = 2 a \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\eta}{\\\\partial h} + 6b \\\\eta^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\eta}{\\\\partial h} - 1 :[2 a + 6b \\\\eta^2] \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\eta}{\\\\partial h} = 1 In this case, recalling in the zero-field case that \\\\eta^2 = -a/b at low temperatures, while \\\\eta^2=0 for temperatures above the critical temperature, the zero-field susceptibility therefore has the following temperature dependence: :\\\\chi(T,h\\\\to 0) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{2a_0(T-T_c)}, & T>T_c \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{-4a_0(T-T_c)}, & T which is reminiscent of the Curie-Weiss law for the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility in magnetic materials, and yields the mean-field critical exponent \\\\gamma=1. =First-order transitions= While commonly used to study second-order transitions, Landau theory can also be used to study first-order transitions. To model this, one can consider taking the free-energy expansion to sixth-order (in zero field) , :F(T,\\\\eta) = A(T) \\\\eta^2 - B_0 \\\\eta^4 + C_0 \\\\eta^6 where again A(T)=A_0(T-T_c). At some transition temperature T_*, there will be a change in the order parameter from being zero to being non-zero. At high temperatures above some \`\`transition temperature\\" T_*, this free energy functional is everywhere positive and concave up, and the order parameter is zero (since this minimizes the free energy). At the transition temperature, the order parameter will no longer be zero; furthermore, it will occur when the free energy is zero (just like the \\\\eta=0 solution), and furthermore this point should be a local minimum to be a stable solution. Extremizing the free energy with respect to the order parameter for these conditions yields two equations, :0=A(T) \\\\eta^2 - B_0 \\\\eta^4 + C_0 \\\\eta^6 :0=2A(T) \\\\eta - 4B_0 \\\\eta^3 + 6C_0 \\\\eta^5 First-order phase transition demonstrated in the discontinuity of the order parameter as a function of temperature which are satisfied when \\\\eta^2(T_*) = \\\\frac{B_0}{2C_0}. Using the same equations, it is also required that A(T_*) = A_0(T_*-T_c) = B_0^2/4C_0. From this comes two important results; first, the order parameter suffers a discontinuous jump at this transition temperature (since it is zero right above T_* but suddenly jumps right below T_*), characteristic of a first-order transition. Furthermore, the transition temperature T_* at which the order parameter changes is not the same as the critical temperature T_c of the system, where A(T_c)=0. At temperatures below the transition temperature, T, the order parameter is given by :\\\\eta^2 = \\\\frac{B_0}{3C_0} \\\\left[ 1 + \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{3A(T) C_0}{B_0^2}} \\\\right] which is plotted to the right. This shows the clear discontinuity associated with the order parameter as a function of the temperature. To further demonstrate that the transition is first-order, one can show that the free energy for this order parameter is continuous at the transition temperature T_*, but its first derivative suffers from a discontinuity. =Applications= It was known experimentally that the liquid‚Äìgas coexistence curve and the ferromagnet magnetization curve both exhibited a scaling relation of the form |T - T_c|^{\\\\beta} , where \\\\beta was mysteriously the same for both systems. This is the phenomenon of universality. It was also known that simple liquid‚Äìgas models are exactly mappable to simple magnetic models, which implied that the two systems possess the same symmetries. It then followed from Landau theory why these two apparently disparate systems should have the same critical exponents, despite having different microscopic parameters. It is now known that the phenomenon of universality arises for other reasons (see Renormalization group). In fact, Landau theory predicts the incorrect critical exponents for the Ising and liquid‚Äìgas systems. The great virtue of Landau theory is that it makes specific predictions for what kind of non-analytic behavior one should see when the underlying free energy is analytic. Then, all the non-analyticity at the critical point, the critical exponents, are because the equilibrium value of the order parameter changes non-analytically, as a square root, whenever the free energy loses its unique minimum. The extension of Landau theory to include fluctuations in the order parameter shows that Landau theory is only strictly valid near the critical points of ordinary systems with spatial dimensions higher than 4. This is the upper critical dimension, and it can be much higher than four in more finely tuned phase transition. In Mukhamel's analysis of the isotropic Lifschitz point, the critical dimension is 8. This is because Landau theory is a mean field theory, and does not include long-range correlations. This theory does not explain non-analyticity at the critical point, but when applied to superfluid and superconductor phase transition, Landau's theory provided inspiration for another theory, the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory of superconductivity. Including long-range correlations Consider the Ising model free energy above. Assume that the order parameter \\\\Psi and external magnetic field, H, may have spatial variations. Now, the free energy of the system can be assumed to take the following modified form: : F := \\\\int d^D x \\\\ \\\\left( a(T) + r(T) \\\\psi^2(x) + s(T) \\\\psi^4(x) \\\\ + f(T) ( abla \\\\psi(x))^2 \\\\ +h(x) \\\\psi(x)\\\\ \\\\ + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\psi^6 ; ( abla \\\\psi)^4) \\\\right) where D is the total spatial dimensionality. So, : \\\\langle \\\\psi(x) \\\\rangle := \\\\frac{\\\\text{Tr}\\\\ \\\\psi(x) {\\\\rm e}^{-\\\\beta H}}{Z} Assume that, for a localized external magnetic perturbation h(x) \\\\rightarrow 0 + h_0 \\\\delta(x) , the order parameter takes the form \\\\psi(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\psi_0 + \\\\phi(x) . Then, : \\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\langle \\\\psi(x) \\\\rangle}{\\\\delta h(0)} = \\\\frac{\\\\phi(x)}{h_0} = \\\\beta \\\\left ( \\\\langle \\\\psi(x) \\\\psi(0) \\\\rangle - \\\\langle \\\\psi(x) \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi(0) \\\\rangle \\\\right ) That is, the fluctuation \\\\phi(x) in the order parameter corresponds to the order-order correlation. Hence, neglecting this fluctuation (like in the earlier mean-field approach) corresponds to neglecting the order-order correlation, which diverges near the critical point. One can also solve \\"Equilibrium Statistical Physics\\" by Michael Plischke, Birger Bergersen, Section 3.10, 3rd ed for \\\\phi(x), from which the scaling exponent, u , for correlation length \\\\xi \\\\sim (T-T_c)^{- u} can deduced. From these, the Ginzburg criterion for the upper critical dimension for the validity of the Ising mean-field Landau theory (the one without long- range correlation) can be calculated as: : D \\\\ge 2 + 2 \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{ u} In our current Ising model, mean-field Landau theory gives \\\\beta = 1/2 = u and so, it (the Ising mean-field Landau theory) is valid only for spatial dimensionality greater than or equal to 4 (at the marginal values of D=4, there are small corrections to the exponents). This modified version of mean- field Landau theory is sometimes also referred to as the Landau-Ginzburg theory of Ising phase transitions. As a clarification, there is also a Landau- Ginzburg theory specific to superconductivity phase transition, which also includes fluctuations.

Its crest, at Ka ªala, is the highest peak on Oahu at . Like the neighboring Koolau, the Waianae Range is not a mountain range in the sense most people are familiar with, as the mountain range as a whole was created from a single volcano rather than for example plate tectonics. The oldest lava dated from the volcano are about 3.9 million years old. About 3.2 million years ago, the volcano's activity changed, the rate of eruption started to decrease and the composition of the lava erupted from the volcano changed. The volcano is thought to have last erupted about 2.5 million years ago. When active, the Waianae volcano's center of activity was at present-day Lualualei Valley. Intense erosion on the western flank of the mountain has destroyed much of those flanks. Thus, the mountain today is much smaller than it was when the volcano was active. While the western part of the mountain has been destroyed by erosion, the eastern part is still in a youthful stage of erosion. This is considered somewhat strange by some geologists since the western part of the volcano is on the leeward side of the island; thus, most rain falls on the eastern side of the volcano. Given this information, more erosion would be expected on the eastern portion of the mountain. One theory to explain this erosion pattern is that a large landslide cut away the western portion of the volcano. The faults from this huge landslide weakened the rock, making the western part of the mountain much more susceptible to erosion than the eastern side.

It is used to treat allergies, trouble sleeping, and nausea. It may help with some symptoms associated with the common cold. It may also be used for sedating people who are agitated or anxious. It is available by mouth as a syrup, as a rectal suppository, or by injection into a muscle. Common side effects include confusion and sleepiness. Alcohol or other sedatives can make this worse. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe for the baby. Use is not recommended in those less than two years old due to potentially negative effects on breathing. Use by injection into a vein is not recommended due to potential skin damage. It is in the phenothiazine family of medications. Promethazine was made in the 1940s by a team of scientists from Rh√¥ne-Poulenc laboratories. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1951. It is a generic medication and is available under many brand names globally. The wholesale cost of the by mouth formulation is less than US$0.20 per dose as of 2018. In the United Kingdom this dose costs less than ¬£0.25. In 2017, it was the 147th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions.  Medical uses  Promethazine has a variety of medical uses, including: * Sedation * Nausea and vomiting association with anesthesia or chemotherapy. It is commonly used postoperatively as an antiemetic. The antiemetic activity increases with increased dosing; however, side effects also increase, which often limits maximal dosing. * For moderate to severe morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum: In the UK, promethazine is drug of first choice, being preferred as an older drug with which there is a greater experience of use in pregnancy (second in line being metoclopramide or prochlorperazine).. * For allergies such as hay fever and together with other medications in anaphylaxis *To aid with symptoms of the common cold *Motion sickness *Hemolytic disease of the newborn *Anxiety before surgery  Side effects  Some documented side effects include: * Tardive dyskinesia, pseuodoparkinsonism, acute dystonia (effects due to dopamine D2 receptor antagonism) * Confusion in the elderly * Drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, more rarely vertigo * Dry mouth * NauseaNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence * Respiratory depression in patients under age of two and in those with severely compromised pulmonary function * Blurred vision, xerostomia, dry nasal passages, dilated pupils, constipation, and urinary retention. (due to cholinergic effects) * Chest discomfort/pressure (In children less than 2 years old) * AkathisiaCordingley Neurology Less frequent: * Cardiovascular side effects to include arrhythmias and hypotension * Neuroleptic malignant syndrome * Liver damage and cholestatic jaundice * Bone marrow suppression, potentially resulting in agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia * Depression of the thermoregulatory mechanism resulting in hypothermia/hyperthermia Rare side effects include: * Seizures Because of potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid in the elderly.NCQA‚Äôs HEDIS Measure: Use of High Risk Medications in the Elderly In many countries (including the US and UK), promethazine is contraindicated in children less than two years of age, and strongly cautioned against in children between two and six, due to problems with respiratory depression and sleep apnea. Promethazine is listed as one of the drugs of highest anticholinergic activity in a study of anticholinergenic burden, including long-term cognitive impairment.  Pharmacology  Promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative, is structurally different from the neuroleptic phenothiazines, with similar but different effects. It acts primarily as a strong antagonist of the H1 receptor (antihistamine) and a moderate mACh receptor antagonist (anticholinergic), and also has weak to moderate affinity for the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, D2, and Œ±1-adrenergic receptors, where it acts as an antagonist at all sites, as well. Another notable use of promethazine is as a local anesthetic, by blockade of sodium channels. = Chemistry = Solid promethazine hydrochloride is a white to faint-yellow, practically odorless, crystalline powder. Slow oxidation may occur upon prolonged exposure to air, usually causing blue discoloration. Its hydrochloride salt is freely soluble in water and somewhat soluble in alcohol. Promethazine is a chiral compound, occurring as a mixture of enantiomers. History Promethazine was first synthesized by a group at Rhone-Poulenc (which later became part of Sanofi) led by Paul Charpentier in the early 1940s. The team was seeking to improve on diphenhydramine; the same line on medical chemistry led to the creation of chlorpromazine. Society and culture As of July 2017 it was marketed under many brand names worldwide: Allersoothe, Antiallersin, Anvomin, Atosil, Avomine, Closin N, Codopalm, Diphergan, Farganesse, Fenazil, Fenergan, Fenezal, Frinova, Hiberna, Histabil, Histaloc, Histantil, Histazin, Histazine, Histerzin, Lenazine, Lergigan, Nufapreg, Otosil, Pamergan, Pharmaniaga, Phenadoz, Phenerex, Phenergan, Ph√©nergan, Pipolphen, Polfergan, Proazamine, Progene, Prohist, Promet, Prometal, Prometazin, Prometazina, Promethazin, Prom√©thazine, Promethazinum, Promethegan, Promezin, Proneurin, Prothazin, Prothiazine, Prozin, Pyrethia, Quitazine, Reactifargan, Receptozine, Romergan, Sominex, Sylomet, Xepagan, Zinmet, and Zoralix. It is also marketed in many combination drug formulations: * with carbocisteine as Actithiol Antihistaminico, Mucoease, Mucoprom, Mucotal Prometazine, and Rhinathiol; *with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as Algotropyl, Calmkid, Fevril, Phen Plus, and Velpro-P; *with paracetamol and dextromethorphan as Choligrip na noc, Coldrex Noƒçn√° Lieƒçba, Fedril Night Cold and Flu, Night Nurse, and Tachinotte; *with paracetamol, phenylephrine, and salicylamide as Flukit; *with dextromethorphan as Axcel Dextrozine and Hosedyl DM; *with dextromethorphan and ephedrine as Methorsedyl; *with dextromethorphan and pseudoephedrine as Sedilix-DM; *with dextromethorphan and phenylephedrine as Sedilix-RX; *with pholcodine as Codo-Q Junior and Tixylix; *with pholcodine and ephedrine as Phensedyl Dry Cough Linctus; *with pholcodine and phenylephedrine as Russedyl Compound Linctus; *with pholcodine and phenylpropanolamine as Triple 'P'; *with codeine as Kefei and Procodin; *with codeine and ephedrine as Dhasedyl, Fendyl, and P.E.C.; *with ephedrine and dextromethorphan as Dhasedyl DM; *with glutamic acid as Psico-Soma, and Psicosoma; *with noscapine as Tussisedal; and *with chlorpromazine and phenobarbital as Vegetamin. =Recreational use= The recreational drug Purple drank often contains a combination of promethazine with codeine containing cold medication. = Product liability lawsuit = In 2009, the US Supreme Court ruled on a product liability case involving promethazine. Diana Levine, a woman suffering from a migraine, was administered Wyeth's Phenergan via IV push. The drug was injected improperly, resulting in gangrene and subsequent amputation of her right forearm below the elbow. A state jury awarded her $6 million in punitive damages. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court on grounds of federal preemption and substantive due process. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' rulings, stating that \\"Wyeth could have unilaterally added a stronger warning about IV-push administration\\" without acting in opposition to federal law. In effect, this means drug manufacturers can be held liable for injuries if warnings of potential adverse effects, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are deemed insufficient by state courts. On September 9, 2009, the FDA required a boxed warning be put on promethazine for injection, stating the contraindication for subcutaneous administration. The preferred administrative route is intramuscular, which reduces risk of surrounding muscle and tissue damage.

It is based on the philosophy of responsible freedom, personal initiative, and individualized education. The Anchorage School District established the school in 1974 as a response to a proposal by the Committee of Alternative Secondary Education. Steller was named after Georg Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist from Germany who traveled with Vitus Bering on an exploratory voyage to Alaska. The school was named after him because of his independence, love of knowledge, courage, and pioneering spirit. Academic Competitions =All-State Band= Steller has had a number of students who are selected annually to participate in the ASAA Alaska All-State Band. In 2017, Steller students Sebastien Libbrecht, Kohiby Vierthaler, and Tatiana Rogers have been admitted to the music festival.http://asaa.org/wp- content/uploads/2017-All-State-Band-Selected-Participant-List.pdf Building history For the first nine years of its existence, Steller was located in the old North Star Elementary School building. After much political activity by Steller parents, the Alaska Legislature approved funds to remodel the school and add a new gym as well as a drama facility/auditorium. In 1992, the auditorium was rebuilt after a structural failure caused the roof to collapse, leaving nearly everything ruined except for the stage's curtains. The voters of Anchorage approved a school bond in 2003 to provide funding for the addition of a new science lab and relocation and renovation of the staff lounge, offices surrounding the gymnasium, and the special education office. This construction was completed in October 2004. Sports =Extramural Sports= Steller does not participate in sports within the Anchorage School District, but its students are allowed to play sports for a high school (or middle school depending on grade level) of their choice. This opportunity is not afforded to students in traditional schools within the ASD. =Intramural Sports= Many students and staff at Steller participate in an intramural gym hockey league. These games are closely followed by many members of the Steller community and culminate in a series of playoffs in late February.  Wars  = The Silverfish War = On March 20th, 2018, the student government of Steller Secondary (referred to as OP Group) declared war on the silverfish within the school. Arming themselves with a multitude of weapons such as longswords, scissors, flamethrowers, and trebuchets, the students and staff of Steller Secondary tore down the walls and stormed the tunnels of the school and attempted to eliminate all silverfish within the school. The assault began at 2:45 pm on March 20th, 2018 and ended at 3:58 am the following day. The battle resulted in the casualties of 82% of the student and staff and 3% of the silverfish population. Following the war, the remaining students and staff have been rigorously fundraising so the school can buy an atomic bomb to finally rid the school of silverfish. So far, the fundraising is yet to meet its goal of 9 billion USD.

They are two incompetent detectives who provide much of the comic relief throughout the series. While their different (albeit similar) surnames would suggest they are unrelated, they look like identical twins whose only discernible difference is the shape of their moustaches. They are afflicted with chronic spoonerisms, are extremely clumsy, thoroughly clueless, and usually intent on arresting the wrong character. In spite of this, they somehow are entrusted with delicate missions. The detective with the flat, drooping walrus moustache is Thompson and introduces himself as \\"Thompson, with a 'P', as in psychology\\" (or \\"Philadelphia\\", or any such word in which the \\"P\\" is not pronounced as \\"P\\"), while the detective with the flared, pointed moustache is Thomson, who often introduces himself as \\"Thomson, without a 'P', as in Venezuela.\\" Often, when one says something, the other adds \\"To be precise\\" (), but then repeats what the first said, only twisted around. This trait has gained popularity. Thomson and Thompson usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks, except when abroad: during these missions they insist on wearing the stereotypical costume of the country they are visiting so that they blend into the local population, but instead manage to dress in folkloric attire that actually makes them stand apart. The detectives were in part based on Herg√©'s father and uncle, identical twins who wore matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks. Character history In Tintin in America there are characters similar to the twins: two policemen collide and Mike MacAdam is a incompetent detective. Thomson and Thompson first appeared in Tintin in the Congo, making only a brief one-panel appearance; their first appearance towards the plot of a story was in 1932, in Cigars of the Pharaoh, when they come into conflict with Tintin on board a ship where he and Snowy are enjoying a holiday cruise. When this adventure was first published they were referred to as X33 and X33bis (or X33 and X33b). Here they show an unusually high level of cunning and efficiency, going to great lengths to rescue Tintin from the firing squad and saving Snowy from sacrifice in disguises that fool even Tintin. In this and two other early stories ‚Äî The Blue Lotus and The Black Island ‚Äî they spend most of their time, forced to follow official orders and faked evidence, in pursuit of Tintin himself for crimes he has not committed, the two noting in Blue Lotus that they never believed in Tintin's guilt even if they had to obey their orders. Except for their codenames, they remained nameless in the early adventures. It was not until King Ottokar's Sceptre, published in 1938, that Tintin mentions their definitive names when introducing them to Professor Alembick at the airport. In his 1941 play Tintin in India: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond co-written with Jacques Van Melkebeke, Herg√© named them as \\"Durant and Durand\\", although he later renamed them as \\"Dupont and Dupond\\". When King Ottokar's Sceptre was serialised in Eagle for British readers in 1951, the characters were referred to as \\"Thomson and Thompson\\"; these names were later adopted by translators Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner in their translation of the series into English for Methuen Publishing. While the original version of Cigars of the Pharaoh was published in 1932, the rewritten and redrawn version was issued in 1955, and the English version was not issued until 1971. This resulted in some chronological confusion for new readers of the Tintin series, which is why the text hints that Tintin already knows the pair, and is surprised at their unfriendly behaviour; however, on the original chronological sequence, this is indeed the first time they ever meet. In addition, Herg√© added them to the 1946 colour version of the second Tintin story, Tintin in the Congo, in the backdrop as Tintin embarks for what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thomson and Thompson were originally only side characters but later became more important. In the re-drawings of the earlier books, especially The Black Island, the detectives gained their now-traditional mannerisms. In Land of Black Gold, the detectives mistakenly swallow some mysterious pills used to adulterate fuel, that causes them to sprout immensely long beards and hair that change colour constantly and grow at a break-neck pace. The condition wears off by the end of this adventure, but it relapses in Explorers on the Moon, causing problems when Captain Haddock must continuously cut their hair, repeatedly switching back to re-cut floor length hair (and mustaches and beards) which all grow back in seconds. Frustrated at this, the captain exclaims \\"After all this, when they ask me what did I do on the spaceship, I'll reply 'Me, you say? I was the barber!'\\" In the 19 books following Cigars of the Pharaoh, Thomson and Thompson appear in 17 of them, not appearing in Tintin in Tibet or Flight 714 to Sydney. In some of these books their role is minor ‚Äî the duo's appearance in The Shooting Star is confined to two panels; they appear briefly only at the beginning of The Broken Ear (before being tricked into closing the case in the belief that the stolen object has been returned when it was actually replaced by a fake); and are imprisoned and face execution on false charges in Tintin and the Picaros. During their other appearances, they serve as the official investigators into whatever crimes Tintin is currently investigating. Inspiration and cultural impact The detectives were in part based on Herg√©'s father Alexis and uncle L√©on, identical twins who often took walks together wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks. Another inspiration was a picture of two mustachioed, bowler-hatted, formally dressed detectives who were featured on the cover of the Le Miroir edition of 2 March 1919. They were shown escorting Emile Cottin, who had attacked Georges Clemenceau‚Äîone detective was handcuffed to the man while the other was holding both umbrellas.Michael Farr, Tintin: The Complete Companion, John Murray, 2001. They also make a brief cameo appearance in the Asterix book Asterix in Belgium. They make an appearance in L'ombra che sfid√≤ Sherlock Holmes, an Italian comic spin-off of Martin Myst√®re, edited by Sergio Bonelli Editore.L'ombra che sfid√≤ Sherlock Holmes, Storie da Altrove, Sergio Bonelli Editore, November 2000, p. 55 The name of the pop group the Thompson Twins was based on Thomson and Thompson. The detectives are regular characters in the 1991‚Äì1992 television series The Adventures of Tintin (TV series).https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/18/how-could-do-this- tintin as well as the motion-capture film adaptation, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. In the film, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost portray Thomson and Thompson.

Both are outstanding examples of nineteenth-century yomihon, or \\"books for reading\\" (as opposed to picture books and books for recitation). Life Born as , he wrote under the pen name , which is a pun, as the kanji may also be read as kuruwa de makoto, meaning a man who is truly devoted to the courtesans of the pleasure districts. Later in life he took the pen name . Modern scholarship generally refers to him as Kyokutei Bakin, or just as Bakin. Born in Edo (present-day Tokyo) on 4 July 1767, Bakin was the fifth son of Omon and Okiyoshi. His father, Okiyoshi, was a samurai in the service of one of the Sh≈çgun's retainers, Matsudaira Nobunari. Two of his older brothers died in infancy, while the other two, Rabun (1759‚Äì1798) and Keich≈´ (1765‚Äì1786), played pivotal roles in Bakin's life. He had two younger sisters, Ohisa, born in 1771, and Okiku, born in 1774. In his diaries, Bakin wrote that his father, a heavy drinker, was devoted to scholarship and the classics, and diligent in his work as a samurai. He died in 1775, when Bakin was only nine years old, having aggravated his gout through drinking. Bakin's family stipend was soon reduced by half, and in December of the following year, Rabun gave up his service to the Matsudaira clan in favor of living as a r≈çnin. Bakin and his family were forced into a much smaller dwelling as a result. Eventually Rabun received a new post, and in 1778 Bakin's mother pretended to be sick in order to move in with him. Bakin had been placed in service of the Matsudaira lord's grandson, but was treated cruelly and ran away when only 14. He left the following haiku as a note explaining his reasons for leaving: :„Åì„Åå„Çâ„Åó„Å´ :ÊÄù„ÅÑÁ´ã„Å°„Åë„Çä :Á•û„ÅÆÊóÖ :Chilled by winter winds :I have decided :To journey with the gods. In 1807, Bakin started publishing Chinsetu Yumiharizuki (Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon, Ê§øË™¨ÂºìÂºµÊúà) a fantasy novel, one of his masterpieces about the activities of Minamoto no Tametomo in the H≈çgen rebellion and the founding of the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom, and his popularity skyrocketed. This popularity was also helped by Hokusai's creative and powerful illustrations, but the collaboration ended with seven works due to differences of opinion with Hokusai regarding the illustrations.ÂåóÊñéÁîüË™ï260Âπ¥Ë®òÂøµ ÂåóÊñéË≥áÊ†º„ÅÆ„Éû„Ç∏„ÉÉ„ÇØ Hokusai kanÊõ≤‰∫≠È¶¨Áê¥„Å®ËëõÈ£æÂåóÊñé Hokusai kan Nans≈ç Satomi Hakkenden (The Chronicles of the Eight Dog Heroes of the Satomi Clan of Nans≈ç) took 28 years to complete (1814‚Äì1842), and Bakin grew blind and lost his wife and son before he completed it. Comprising 106 volumes, it is one of the world's longest novels. The final parts of the work were dictated to his daughter-in-law. Although he was born of lower samurai birth, Bakin renounced his status to become a writer. His works center on samurai themes, including loyalty and family honor, as well as Confucianism, and Buddhist philosophy. Excerpts translated by Chris Drake are included in Early Modern Japanese Literature: An Anthology, 1600-1900, edited by Haruo Shirane (Columbia University Press, 2002). The Eight Dog Chronicles has been adapted many times in, for example, the anime OVA The Hakkenden. His Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki (Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon, 1807‚Äì1811) was adapted for the kabuki stage by Yukio Mishima. A series of ukiyo-e containing 50 pictures depicting characters from Nans≈ç Satomi Hakkenden and featuring leading kabuki actors was created by Utagawa Kunisada II. These prints were published in the early 1850s by Tsutaya Kichizo.Catalogue: Chiba Museum, Hakkenden no sekai (2008).

Early years Thomas was born to a Puerto Rican mother and Cuban father. His childhood neighborhood in the Spanish Harlem section of New York City was riddled with crime and violence. According to Thomas, children were expected to be gang members at a young age, and Thomas was no exception. Thomas was also exposed to racial discrimination because of his Afro-Latino heritage.\\"Discrimination, Evasion, and Livability\\" by Marta S. Rivera Monclova, 2013; a dissertation on discrimination against New York Puerto Ricans as portrayed in \\"Down These Mean Streets\\" by Piri Thomas and \\"Yo-Yo Boing!\\" by Giannina Braschi. He identified as Black because of his Afro-Puerto Rican heritage. Thomas was involved with drugs, gang warfare and crime. While spending seven years in prison, Thomas reflected on the teachings of his mother and father, and realized that a person is not born a criminal. Consequently, he decided to use his street and prison know-how to reach at- risk youth, and to help them avoid a life of crime.Life and Flow Down These Mean Streets In 1967, Thomas received funds from the Rabinowitz Foundation to write and publish his best-selling autobiography Down These Mean Streets. The book describes his struggle for survival as a Puerto Rican/Cuban born and raised in the barrios of New York. The book, which has been in print for 52 years, was banned in some places but also required reading, depending on the time and place. He narrated the rampant racism of the pre-Civil Rights Act of 1964. His other works include Savior, Savior Hold My Hand; Seven Long Times; and Stories from El Barrio.

Films The 2018 movie Andy Irons: Kissed by God (directed by adventure-sport documentarians Steve and Todd Jones) is about the three-time world champion who died at 32 after a lifelong struggle with bipolar disorder and addiction. The film features in-depth interviews with Andy's brother Bruce Irons, his wife Lyndie Irons, Joel Parkinson, Nathan Fletcher, Sunny Garcia, and Kelly Slater.Andy Irons: Kissed by God - the Movie, official website. 'Andy Irons: Kissed by God': Film Review by John DeFore, The Hollywood Reporter, 12 June 2018. The 2005 movie Blue Horizon (directed by surfing filmmaker Jack McCoy), paralleled his life on the WCT tour with that of free surfer, David Rastovich. The film also touched on his long-time rivalry with eleven-time world champion Kelly Slater. Although the film was created in a documentary-like style, there has been some debate over whether or not the film offered an accurate and fair portrayal of Irons' surfing lifestyle. In addition to \\"Blue Horizon\\", Irons was also a subject of many other surf films, including his screen appearance in Trilogy, which starred himself, Joel Parkinson, and Taj Burrow. Rivalry with Kelly Slater Irons had a much-publicized, and, according to him, over-hyped, rivalry with fellow professional surfer Kelly Slater. In an interview, Irons said: > For me, just being affiliated with Kelly--to be next to him--I mean, that's > awesome. He's the ultimate surfer. He's the best surfer in the world. Ever. > Best competitive, best free surfer, you name it, and to have my name put > next to his everywhere really is flattering. He's the Michael Jordan of our > sport. Kelly knows how I feel about him. Despite all the media hype that > comes out of a rivalry there's a lot of respect given both ways. People > don't realize there are times when we hang out. We'll go check the waves > together. We talk about boards. He invited me personally to his contest on > Tavarua. There's a ton of respect there. Slater himself was quoted in a Surfer Magazine tribute for Irons: > Andy was an absolutely gifted individual. I‚Äôm lucky to have known him and > had the times we had together. I feel blessed that we worked through the > differences we had and I was able to learn what I‚Äôm made of because of Andy. > I got to know a happy, funny, innocent kid who was happy to live every > second with the people he loved.

Legacy  A 2018 documentary titled Andy Irons: Kissed by God chronicled Irons' surfing career and his struggles with bipolar disorder and substance abuse. Iron's family runs the Andy Irons Foundation in his memory which focuses on community programs for youth struggling with mental illness.

Background Stone was born in Burrton, Kansas, to Herbert Stone and the former Laura Belfield. There, he graduated from Burrton High School, where he was active in the drama club, played basketball, and sang in a barbershop quartet. His uncle (Stone's brother, Joe Stone, says cousin), Fred Stone, was a versatile actor who appeared on Broadway and in circuses. His brother, Joe, was a writer who was the author of scripts for three episodes of Gunsmoke. Stone was a cousin of the character actress Madge Blake. Although Stone had a congressional appointment to the United States Naval Academy, he turned it down, choosing instead to become an actor with a stock theater company headed by Helen Ross. Career In 1919, Stone debuted on stage in a Kansas tent show. He ventured into vaudeville in the late 1920s, and in 1930, he was half of the Stone and Strain song-and-dance act. His Broadway credits include Around the Corner (1936) and Jayhawker (1934). In the 1930s, Stone came to Los Angeles, California, to launch his own screen career. He was featured in the \\"Tailspin Tommy\\" adventure serial for Monogram Pictures. In 1939 he played Stephen Douglas in the movie \\"Young Mr, Lincoln\\" with Henry Fonda and Ward Bond. In 1939 he appeared in When Tomorrow Comes as Head Busboy (uncredited). In 1940, he appeared with Marjorie Reynolds, Tristram Coffin, and I. Stanford Jolley in the comedy espionage film Chasing Trouble. That same year, he co- starred with Roy Rogers in the film Colorado in the role of Rogers' brother- gone-wrong. Stone appeared uncredited in the 1939 film Blackwell's Island. Stone played Dr. Blake in the 1943 film Gung Ho! and a liberal-minded warden in Monogram Pictures' Prison Mutiny in 1943. Signed by Universal Pictures in 1943, in the film Captive Wild Woman (1943), Jungle Woman (1943), Sherlock Holmes Faces Death [Captain Pat Vickery], (1944), he became a familiar face in its features and serials. In 1944, he portrayed a Ration Board representative in the Universal-produced public service film Prices Unlimited for the U.S. Office of Price Administration and the Office of War Information. One of his film roles was a radio columnist in the Gloria Jean-Kirby Grant musical I'll Remember April. He made such an impression in this film that Universal Studios gave him a starring role (and a similar characterization) in the 1945 serial The Master Key. The same year, he was featured in the Inner Sanctum murder mystery The Frozen Ghost. In 1955, one of CBS Radio's hit series, the Western Gunsmoke, was adapted for television and recast with experienced screen actors. Howard McNear, the radio Doc Adams, was replaced by Stone, who gave the role a harder edge consistent with his screen portrayals. He stayed with Gunsmoke through its entire television run, with the exception of 7 episodes in 1971, when Stone required heart surgery and Pat Hingle replaced him as Dr. Chapman. Stone appeared in 604 episodes through 1975, often shown sparring in a friendly manner with co-stars Dennis Weaver and Ken Curtis, who played, respectively, Chester Goode and Festus Haggen. Death In March 1971,\\"After heart surgery, 'Doc' continues to improve\\", birminghamrewound.com; accessed May 5, 2014. Stone had heart bypass surgery at UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. In June 1980, Stone died of a heart attackhttp://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/milburn-stone/ in La Jolla. He was buried at the El Camino Memorial Park in Sorrento Valley, San Diego.Cemeteries in San Diego Personal life Stone had a surviving daughter, Shirley Stone Gleason (born circa 1926) of Costa Mesa, California, from his first marriage of 12 years to Ellen Morrison, formerly of Delphos, Kansas, who died in 1937. His second wife, the former Jane Garrison, a native of Hutchinson, Kansas, died in 2002. Stone had married, divorced, and remarried Garrison. Legacy In 1968, Stone received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Drama for his work on Gunsmoke. Judith Allen and Milburn Stone in The Port of Missing Girls (1938) In 1975, Stone received an honorary doctorate from St. Mary of the Plains College in Dodge City, Kansas, where Gunsmoke was set but not filmed. A painting of the Doc Adams character was commissioned from Gary Hawk, a painter from Stone's home state of Kansas. When then-U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan, a friend of Stone's, heard about the painting, Hawk was invited to the Oval Office to present the artwork to the President. Stone lived to see Reagan emerge as the likely Republican nominee for President in 1980, but not to witness Reagan's defeat of Jimmy Carter, since Stone died in June 1980, and Reagan was not elected until November 1980. For his contribution to the television industry, Milburn Stone has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.The Hollywood Walk of Fame's website designates Stone as a Star of Motion Pictures and gives the address of his star as 6823 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1981, Stone was inducted posthumously into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. After his death, he left a legacy for the performing arts in Cecil County in northeastern Maryland, by way of the Milburn Stone Theatre in North East, Maryland.

It excludes frigates and lesser warships. The Dutch were often handicapped by the smaller size of their ships relative to the vessels of other nations, particularly those of England and France. This was partly due to the shallow home waters of the Netherlands, which limited the maximum draft with which ships could operate. Consequently the Dutch did not build large three-deckers such as were found in the navies of England and France, except for a brief period from 1682 to 1695 (and a very few later on). However, the Dutch made up in sheer quantity of ships what they lacked in terms of the size of vessels; the list below is incomplete and does not include some of the many hundreds of Dutch warships belonging to the United Provinces between 1579 (when the Netherlands effectively became independent from Spanish control) and 1795 (in which latter year the French invaded and established the puppet state of the Batavian Republic). The Five Admiralties Administratively and politically, there was not a single Dutch Navy but five distinct Admiralties. In the south was the Admiralty of Zeeland covering the Province of Zeeland (indicated by \\"(Z)\\" preceding a ship's name in the list below). Next were three covering the Province of Holland - the Admiralty of the Maas (or \\"Maze\\") in the south of Holland, centred on Rotterdam (indicated by \\"(M)\\"), the Admiralty of Amsterdam in the centre of the Province (indicated by \\"(A)\\"), and the Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier in the north of Holland (indicated by \\"(N)\\"). The fifth was the Admiralty of Friesland covering the Province of Friesland (indicated by \\"(F)\\"), albeit with fewer ships than the other four Admiralties. Each Dutch warship belonged exclusively to one or other of the five Admiralties, although in the 17th century the Dutch fleet included many ships of mercantile ownership, particularly those belonging to the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The names of Dutch warships were often common to several Admiralties, so that there were vessels bearing the same name in different Admiralties at the same time. Armament was often changed, so the number of guns mounted in any ship frequently varied from year to year. During the 1650 - 1680 period, many Dutch ships of the line were \\"up-gunned\\", ending with significantly more guns than when they first came into service. The Dutch Rating System Prior to the first Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch did not have a system of categorising vessels beyond a simple functional division into \\"ships\\", \\"frigates\\" and lesser ship- rigged \\"three-mast yachts\\".Frank Fox, The Four Days' Battle of 1666. The former coincided with the English categories of 1st to 4th Rates, i.e. they comprised the battlefleet units. In 1652 the Dutch - under pressure from their naval commander Maarten Tromp to build larger ships to combat the English - introduced a rating system which was based on a series of Charters, initially grading the battlefleet units by length of ship with classes of 130 Amsterdam feet|(Amsterdam) feet , 136 feet and 140 feet; this was at a time when the largest ship in the Dutch navies measured 134 feet in length. Subsequently, having won the Battle of Dungeness in November 1652, Tromp persuaded the Staten-Generaal to add a further class of 150 feet ships as the \\"1st Charter\\", although only two of this length were built initially - the Eendracht and Groot Hollandia, both launched at Rotterdam in 1653 and 1654 respectively with 58 guns each. Between 1652 and 1680 the \\"Charters\\" underwent drastic revision, but it was still more appropriate to classify ships of the line during this era by their (gundeck) length than by the number of guns carried. The lengths remained the basis of the Charters. By 1680, following the end of the later Anglo-Dutch Wars, the Staten-Generaal divided the warships of the five Admiralties into eight charters. The first four charters comprised the battlefleet, while the other four (5th to 8th Charters) covered frigates and smaller cruising warships. The 1st Charter comprised the largest two-deckers before 1680, then subsequently covered the three-deckers (for which see note below). These were ships carrying more than 70 guns, although this had risen to about 80 guns by 1670 and by 1680 to encompass ships of 90 guns or more. They generally (but not always) carried a mix of 36-pounder and 24-pounder guns on their primary (lower) gun deck, with lighter cannon (18-pounders and 12-pounders) on the upper deck and 6-pounders on their quarterdecks. The other battlefleet Charters were all two-decked warships. By the 1670s the 2nd Charter were all two-decker warships with a number of guns initially around 60 to 74, although by 1680 the 60-gun and 64-gun ships had been relegated to the 3rd Charter. They usually carried 18-pounders (or a mixture of 24-pounders and 18-pounders) on the lower deck. The 3rd and 4th Charter ships usually carried 18-pounders or 12-pounders as their main battery. The 4th Charter ships by 1680 carried between 44 and 56 guns; by 1714 a minimum of 50 guns applied. Dimensions All lengths quoted in this article are measured in Amsterdam feet, taken as the length of the uppermost continuous deck from stem to stern. The Amsterdam foot (Amsterdamse voet) was equivalent to 28.3133 cm, and thus equated to 0.9289 of an English foot, a factor to bear in mind in any comparisons. It was divided into eleven inches (Amsterdamse duim) equal to 2.57393 cm, compared with 2.54 cm for an English inch. Thus 150 Amsterdam feet equated to 139ft 4 inches in English measurement. The Rotterdam foot was considerably longer - 31.39 cm (equal to almost 1.03 English feet) - and was divided into twelve inches, each of 2.615 cm. Three-deckers Most of the Dutch ships of the line, for reasons given above, were built with two decks of guns. However, in the 1660s four ships of the Amsterdam Admiralty were built which were structurally three-deckers (the Spiegel of 1663, followed by the Gouden Leeuw, Witte Olifant and Dolphijn of 1666), but these had only partially-armed upper decks, with guns mounted forwards and aft (under the quarterdeck) but not in the waist at this level. From 1682 twenty complete three-deckers were built, the last in 1721; these comprised the 1st Charter issued on 15 February 1680, and provided for these to have dimensions of 170 (Amsterdam) feet on the gundeck (146 ft 3 in on the keel) x 43 feet x 16 ft. After these twenty, no further 1st Charter ships were built by the Netherlands.  Ships of the \\"Old Navy\\" (1579 to 1652)  This is the period during which the Dutch provinces consolidated their independence from Spanish rule, forming the United Provinces of the Netherlands, and took part in the Eighty Years' War. Ships of this era are not separated by Charter or Rate, as the categorisation system did not operate before 1652. The ships owned by the five Admiralties which were 120 (Amsterdam) feet as measured on the upper deck are listed; these were supplemented frequently by ships hired from the VOC or other mercantile source (this was particularly true in 1652, at the outbreak of the 1st Anglo-Dutch War), but only a few of these are mentioned. * (N) Eenhoorn 34 guns (1623, 125 ft) - 1655 * (M) Aemilia 46 guns (1632, 144 ft) - transferred to France 1643 as a privateer, captured by Spain and broken up 1647 * (Z) Middelburg 30 guns (1632, 125 ft) * (A) Utrecht 32 guns (1633) - Blew up on 28 September 1648 * (R) Gelderland 40 guns (1634, 128 ft) - 1659 * (A) Frederik Hendrik 36 guns (1636) * (A) Zutphen 30 guns (1636, 125 ft) * (A) Bommel 30 guns (1637, 120 ft) - broken up in 1655 * (F) Breda 28 guns (1637 purchase from VOC, 120 ft) - captured by Sweden in the Battle of the Sound in 1658 * (N) Eendracht 42 guns (1639, 130 ft) - sunk in action 1676 * (A) Zon (or Vergulde Zon) 40 guns (1640, 124 ft) * (A) Edam 38 guns (1641, 124 ft) - captured by English Navy on 4 June 1669, becoming HMS Black Bull * (A) Groningen 40 guns (1641, 125 ft) * (A) Goes (or Ter Goes) 40 guns (1641, 124 ft) * (A) Graaf Willem 40 guns (1641, 125 ft) - captured by England at the Battle of the Gabbard, 1653 * (N) Prinses Roijaal 40 guns (1641, 1254 ft) * (R) Prinses Roijaal Maria 36 guns (1643, 124 ft) - captured by England in June 1652, renamed Princess Maria * (A) Gewapende Ruyter (captured French Villeroi) 36 guns (1650) - Captured by England 1652 * (A) Maan 40 guns (1643, 125 ft) - broken up 1656 * (A) Verenigde Provinci√´ (or Zeven Provinci√´n) 40 guns (1643, 128 ft) - broken up 1665 * (A) Zeelandia 34 guns (1643, 120 ft) - sunk in action 12 December 1677 * (Z) Vlissingen 32 guns (1643, 130 ft) * (R) Brederode 54 guns (1644, 144 ft) - Gradually upgunned to 59 guns, captured and sunk in the Battle of the Sound on 8 November 1658 * (A) Haarlem 40 guns (1644, 128 ft) - broken up 1667 * (A) Leeuwarden 34 guns (1645, 121 ft) - hired to Venice 1655 * (A) Jaarsveld 44 guns (1648, 130 ft) - Wrecked 9 February 1653 * (A) Vrede 44 guns (1650, 131¬Ω ft) - broken up 1667 * (A) Huis van Nassau 36 guns (1651) - captured from Portugal 1651 and sold same year * (A) Vrijheid 46 guns (1651, 134 ft) - sunk in action at Battle of Palermo on 2 June 1676 =Hired East India Company (VOC) ships= * Mercurius 36 guns (1653, 122¬Ω ft) - East Indiaman.

Captured by England at Battle of Portland in 1653, renamed Great Charity; retaken by the Dutch at Battle of Lowestoft in 1665.  Ships of the \\"New Navy\\" (1652 to 1682)  This is the period during which the United Provinces fought three Anglo-Dutch Wars - conflicts of 1652-1656, 1665-1667 and 1672-1674; although England withdrew from this contest in 1674, the Dutch remained at war against the French until 1678. The Charter (rating) system was introduced in 1652 - initially defined by ships' lengths - but was radically revised during this era (see notes above). At the start of the 1st Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch navies relied heavily on hired ships to expand their fleet, but a programme to build thirty new ships of the line was promptly started. This comprised a flagship of 150 (Amsterdam) feet in length (the Eendracht of 1653), and twenty-nine other ships of 130 feet or more. It was followed within a year by a second thirty-ship programme, again consisting of a flagship of 150 (Amsterdam) feet in length (the Groot Hollandia of 1654), and twenty-nine other ships of 130 feet or more. = 1st Charter (150 feet length) = The first two of these were launched for the Maas Admiralty in 1653 and 1654. The first was originally intended to be named Prins Willem, but Willem himself ruled that it should bear the name Eendracht (\\"Concord\\") to honour the relationship between the seven provinces which constituted the United Netherlands. * (M) Eendracht 58 guns originally, 72 by 1665 (1653).

By the start of the 1680s, the ships of the 1660s were wearing out, and in 1682 a programme of 36 new ships was authorised by the Staten-Generaal. In 1685 a long-term plan for a battlefleet of 96 ships was agreed in principle (to comprise 20 of the 1st Charter, 28 of the 2nd, 24 of the 3rd and 24 of the 4th), although this target was never fully achieved. = 1st Charter = These were all three-deckers, with standard dimensions (all in Amsterdam feet) of 170 ft on the upper deck, 146¬º ft on the keel, 43 ft in breadth and 16 ft depth in hold. In later ships this standard was stretched to a greater length. The typical armament for one of these ships was 28 x 24pdrs on the lower deck, 28 x 18pdrs on the middle deck, 28 x 12pdrs on the upper deck and 8 x 6pdrs on the quarterdeck; however, this varied sometimes. * (Z) Zeelandia 90-94 guns (1682, 170 ft) * (N) Westfriesland 90-94 guns (1682, 170 ft) * (M) Admiraal Generaal (or Kapitein Generaal) 86 guns (1683, 170 ft) - Discarded 1704 * (A) Prinses Maria 92 guns (1683, 170 ft) - sold to be broken up in 1708 * (A) Prins Willem 92 guns (1687, 170 ft) - broken up in 1717 or 1718 * (N) Kasteel van Medemblik 90-94 guns (1688, 170 ft) * (M) Koning Willem 92-94 guns (1688, 170 ft) * (A) Keurvorst van Brandenburg 92 guns (1689, 170 ft) - Renamed Koning van Pruisen ('King of Prussia') in 1701, broken up in 1715 * (A) Keurvorstin van Brandenburg 92 guns (1689, 170 ft) - Renamed Koningen van Pruisen ('Queen of Prussia') in 1701, broken up in 1713 * (A) Keurvorst van Saksen 92 guns (1689, 170 ft) * (N) Beschermer 96 (1690, 170 ft)) * (M) Beschermer 90 guns (1691, 174 ft) - sold to be broken up in 1715 * (Z) Middelburg 80 guns (1691) * (A) Unie 94 (1692, 173 ft) - broken up 1721 * (M) Zeven Provinci√´n 90-94 guns (1694, 170 ft) - stranded in 1705, wreck sold 1706 * (A) Vrijheid 96 gund (1695, 176 ft) - sold to be broken up in 1723 * (Z) Middelburg 80-88 guns (1699, 180 ft) * (M) Eendracht 100 guns (1703, 181 ft) * (A) Amsterdam 96 guns (1712, 176 ft) - sold 1738 as useless Note that, although the 1685 long-term Plan had called for twenty ships of the 1st Charter to be built, the twentieth and last Dutch three-decker - the Amsterdam Admiralty's 96-gun Haarlem (of 177 ft) was not built until 1721. = 2nd Charter = These were all two-deckers, with standard dimensions (all in Amsterdam feet) of 156 ft on the upper deck, 133¬Ω ft on the keel, 41 ft in breadth and 15 ft depth in hold.

Members frequently changed until the release of the first album, and from there Deen has had four members: vocalist and lyricist Shuichi Ikemori, keyboardist and leader Koji Yamane, guitarist Shinji Tagawa and drummer Naoki Uzumoto. In January 2000, Utsumoto and in March 2018, Tagawa left the group. The band has sold over 15 million compact discs. History In the \\"Being\\" agency, Show Wesugi (original vocalist with Wands) and Tetsur≈ç Oda made song \\"Konomama Kimidake wo Ubaisaritai\\" (lit. \\"Now, I want to make off with only you\\"). The group was formed for singing this song. The band debuted by the single on March 10, 1993. The single was certified a million-seller by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). Their 1994 song \\"Hitomi Sorasanaide\\" (lit. \\"Don't Avert Your Eyes\\"), written by Izumi Sakai and Tetsur≈ç Oda, reached number-one position on the Japanese Oricon charts. Their first album Deen was also certified a million-seller by RIAJ. The group originally seemed to be just a project, but they began to perform live concerts in 1996. They also began to release their self-produced singles, but their sales declined. Their 1997 song \\"Yume de Aru Youni\\" (lit. \\"hope that it will be a dream\\"), written by themselves, was adopted by Tales of Destiny. It was no longer able to reach Top 10 on the Oricon charts. But for fans, this song remained most popular over a decade. In 1998, the band partly moved to BMG Japan under the Berg label, which consisted of the \\"being\\" agency artists. Since their 1999 single \\"Just One\\", almost all singles has been produced by them, but Utsumoto left Deen in 2000. They introduced classical music into their music. In 2002, they released a cover version of Kyu Sakamoto's \\"Miagete Goran Yoru no Hoshi o\\", featuring solo violinist Diana Yukawa. They began to call their style \\"Neo- AOR\\" after album Pray. The band completely moved from the \\"being\\" agency to BMG Japan in 2003. Their next album Utopia, released on November 5, 2003, enlisted the help of Al Schmitt. In 2006, baseball manager Bobby Valentine participated in the music video of their song \\"Diamond\\". On June 8, 2008, they performed their first live concert at the Nippon Budokan. On December 10, 2008, they released the single \\"Eien no Ashita\\" (lit. \\"Eternal Tomorrow\\"), adopted by Tales of Hearts. The single debuted at #6 on the Oricon weekly single charts. It was their highest position after 1996. On January 12, 2018, the guitarist and composer Tagawa has announced withdrawal from the band after 25th anniversary Budoukan Live finishes, which makes now left only two members keyboardist Yamane and vocalist Ikemori. On February 28 they released compilation album DEEN The Best FOREVER Complete Singles+ as part of their 25th debut anniversary, which will include their final song as 3 members \\"Journey\\". In August they've released three digital singles which includes completely new song Aloha and rearrangement of famous hits as Hitomi Sorasanaide and Power of Love with subtitle Jawaiian Style. On December 26 they've released 25th music video and blu-ray live footage Deen Live Joy Countdown Special: Solo! Solo!!

It sets chapters 26 and 27 of the Gospel of Matthew (in the Luther Bible) to music, with interspersed chorales and arias. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest masterpieces of classical sacred music. The original Latin title ' translates to \\"The Passion of our Lord J[esus] C[hrist] according to the Evangelist Matthew\\".Markus Rathey. 2016. Bach‚Äôs Major Vocal Works. Music, Drama, Liturgy, Yale University Press History Fair copy in Bach's own hand of the revised version of the St Matthew Passion BWV 244 that is generally dated to the year 1743‚Äì46 The St Matthew Passion is the second of two Passion settings by Bach that have survived in their entirety, the first being the St John Passion, first performed in 1724. =Versions and contemporary performances= Little is known with certainty about the creation process of the St Matthew Passion. The available information derives from extant early manuscripts, contemporary publications of the libretto, and circumstantial data, for instance in documents archived by the Town Council of Leipzig. The St Matthew Passion was probably first performed on 11 April (Good Friday) 1727 in the St. Thomas Church, and again on 15 April 1729, 30 March 1736, and 23 March 1742. Bach then revised it again between 1743 and 1746. First version (BWV 244.1, previously 244b) In Leipzig it was not allowed to paraphrase the words of the Gospel in a Passion presentation on Good Friday. A setting of the then-popular Brockes Passion libretto, largely consisting of such paraphrasing, could not be done without replacing the paraphrases by actual Gospel text. That was the option chosen by Bach for his 1724 St John Passion. In 1725 Christian Friedrich Henrici, a Leipzig poet who used Picander as his pen name, had published (\\"Edifying Thoughts on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday\\"), containing free verse suitable for a Passion presentation in addition to the Gospel text. Bach seems to have stimulated the poet to write more of such verse in order to come to a full- fledged libretto for a Passion presentation combined with the Passion text chapters 26 and 27 in the Gospel of St Matthew. Since 1975 it is usually assumed that Bach's St Matthew Passion was first performed on Good Friday 11 April 1727,Robin A. Leaver, \\"St Matthew Passion\\" Oxford Composer Companions: J. S. Bach, ed. Malcolm Boyd. Oxford: Oxford University Press (1999): 430. \\"Until 1975 it was thought that the St Matthew Passion was originally composed for Good Friday 1729, but modern research strongly suggests that it was performed two years earlier.\\" although its first performance may have been as late as Good Friday 1729 as older sources assert.Spitta 1884, pp. 477‚Äì569 The performance took place in the St. Thomas Church (Thomaskirche) in Leipzig. Bach was Thomaskantor (i.e. Cantor, and responsible for the music in the church) since 1723. In this version the Passion was written for two choruses and orchestras. Choir I consists of a soprano in ripieno voice, a soprano solo, an alto solo, a tenor solo, SATB chorus, two traversos, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two oboes da caccia, lute, strings (two violin sections, violas and cellos), and continuo (at least organ). Choir II consists of SATB voices, violin I, violin II, viola, viola da gamba, cello, two traversos, two oboes (d'amore) and possibly continuo.Bach-digital, BWV 244b Funeral cantata for K√∂then (BWV 1143, previously 244a) Klagt, Kinder, klagt es aller Welt, BWV 244a, a cantata of which only the text is extant, was performed 24 March 1729 in K√∂then at a memorial service held some months after the death of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then. The music of the cantata consisted largely of music adapted from the St Matthew Passion.Bach-digital, BWV 244a Passion performances in the St. Thomas Church \\"Small\\" organ loft in the St. Thomas Church, that would have fitted Chorus II and Orchestra II of the St Matthew Passion in Bach's time (note: the organ on this photograph is a late 20th- century addition) At the time only men sang in church: high pitch vocal parts were usually performed by treble choristers. In 1730 Bach informed the Leipzig Town Council as to what he saw as the number of singers that should be available for the churches under his responsibility, including those for the St. Thomas Church: a choir of twelve singers, plus eight singers that would serve both St. Thomas and the Peterskirche. The request was only partially granted by the Town Council,Spitta 1884, p. 239 ff. so possibly at least some of the Passion presentations in St. Thomas were with fewer than twenty singers, even for the large scale works, like the St Matthew Passion, that were written for double choir.David, Hans T. and Arthur Mendel. The Bach Reader. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1966. p. 124. In Bach's time St. Thomas Church had two organ lofts: the large organ loft that was used throughout the year for musicians performing in Sunday services, vespers, etc., and the small organ loft, situated at the opposite side of the former, that was used additionally in the grand services for Christmas and Easter. The St Matthew Passion was composed as to perform a single work from both organ lofts at the same time: Chorus and orchestra I would occupy the large organ loft, and Chorus and orchestra II performed from the small organ loft. The size of the organ lofts limited the number of performers for each Choir. Large choruses, in addition to the instrumentists indicated for Choir I and II, would have been impossible, so also here there is an indication that each part (including those of strings and singers) would have a limited number of performers, where, for the choruses, the numbers indicated by Bach in his 1730 request would appear to be (more than?) a maximum of what could be fitted in the organ lofts.Rifkin, Joshua (1982). \\"Bach's Chorus: A Preliminary Report.\\" The Musical Times 123(377), 747‚Äì754. Later revisions and performances (BWV 244.2, previously 244) Bach revised the Passion by 1736, for a performance on Good Friday 30 March 1736. This is the version (with some possible later adjustments) that is generally known as the St Matthew Passion, BWV 244. In this version both choirs have SATB soloists and chorus, and a string section and continuo consisting of at least violins I and II, viola, gamba and organ. The woodwinds are two traversos, oboes and oboes d'amore for each choir, and in addition for choir I two oboes da caccia.Bach-digital, BWV 244 Some parts were adjusted for a new performance on Good Friday 23 March 1742. Bach finalized his autograph score in 1743‚Äì1746; however, this undertaking was not tied to any new performance. =Numbering of the movements= Bach did not number the sections of the St Matthew Passion, all of them vocal movements, but twentieth-century scholars have done so. The two main schemes in use today are the scheme from the Neue Bach-Ausgabe (NBA, New Bach Edition) which uses a 1 through 68 numbering system, and the older Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV, Bach Works Catalog) scheme which divides the work into 78 numbers. Both use lettered subsections in some cases. (uses NBA numbering) This article is written using the NBA numbering system. = Text = Bach worked together with his librettist, Christian Friedrich Henrici, known as Picander who published the text of the libretto of the St Matthew Passion in 1729.Picander 1729 Bible text The Bible text used for Part One is . Part Two uses and Additionally, Song of Songs 6:1 is used in the opening aria (with chorus) of Part Two (No. 30). Free verse Picander wrote text for recitatives and arias, and for the large scale choral movements that open and close the Passion. Other libretto sections came from publications by Salomo Franck and Barthold Heinrich Brockes.Booklet of Johann Sebastian Bach: Matth√§us-Passion Karl Richter, M√ºnchener Bach-Orchester et. al. Archiv Produktion 1980 Chorales The chorale melodies and their texts would have been known to those attending the services in the St Thomas church. The oldest chorale Bach used in the St Matthew Passion dates from 1525. Three chorales are written by Paul Gerhardt and Bach included five stanzas from his O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden. Bach used the hymns in different ways, most are four-part setting, two as the of the two chorale fantasias framing Part I, one as a commenting element in a tenor recitative. In the early version BWV 244b the chorale No. 17 appears to be missing, and movement No. 29, concluding Part One, is a four- part setting of the chorale \\"Jesum lass ich nicht von mir\\" instead of the chorale fantasia on \\"O Mensch, bewein dein S√ºnde gro√ü\\".  Composition  Many composers wrote musical settings of the Passion in the late 17th century. Like other Baroque oratorio passions, Bach's setting presents the Biblical text of Matthew 26‚Äì27 in a relatively simple way, primarily using recitative, while aria and arioso movements set newly written poetic texts which comment on the various events in the Biblical narrative and present the characters' states of mind in a lyrical, monologue-like manner. The St Matthew Passion is set for two choirs and two orchestras. Both include two transverse flutes (Choir 1 also includes 2 recorders for No. 19), two oboes, in certain movements instead oboe d'amore or oboe da caccia, two violins, viola, viola da gamba, and basso continuo. For practical reasons the continuo organ is often shared and played with both orchestras. In many arias a solo instrument or more create a specific mood, such as the central soprano aria No. 49, \\"\\", where the absence of strings and basso continuo mark a desperate loss of security. =Vocal parts= Two distinctive aspects of Bach's setting spring from his other church endeavors. One is the double-choir format, which stems from his own double-choir motets and those of many other composers with which he routinely started Sunday services. The other is the extensive use of chorales, which appear in standard four-part settings, as interpolations in arias, and as a cantus firmus in large polyphonic movements. This is notable in \\"\\", the conclusion of the first half ‚Äì a movement which Bach also used as an opening chorus for the second version (1725) of his St John Passion (later ‚Äì ca. 1730 ‚Äì he reverted to the originally composed \\"Herr, unser Herrscher\\" there).Wolff, Christoph. Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician, 294. New York: WW Norton & Company. 2000 The opening chorus, \\"\\" is also notable for the use of chorale cantus firmus, in which the soprano in ripieno crowns a colossal buildup of polyphonic and harmonic tension, singing a verse of \\"\\". This was sung only in 1742 and 1743‚Äì1746 and had been played on the organ before. Gospel parts No. 60, and beginning of the recitative No. 61a (Bible words written in red) in Bach's autograph score: the recitative contains Christ's last words, and the only words by Christ sung without the characteristic string section accompaniment (\\"Eli, Eli lama asabthani?\\") The narration of the Gospel texts is sung by the tenor Evangelist in secco recitative accompanied only by continuo. Soloists sing the words of various characters, also in recitative; in addition to Jesus, there are named parts for Judas, Peter, two high priests (Pontifex I & II), Pontius Pilate, Pilate's wife (Uxor Pilati), two witnesses (Testis I & II) and two ancillae (maids). These are not always sung by all different soloists. The \\"character\\" soloists are also often assigned arias and sing with the choirs, a practice not always followed by modern performances. Two duets are sung by a pair of soloists representing two simultaneous speakers. A number of passages for several speakers, called turba (crowd) parts, are sung by one of the two choirs or both. The words of Jesus, also termed Vox Christi (voice of Christ), usually receive special treatment. Bach created particularly distinctive accompagnato recitatives in this work: they are accompanied not by continuo alone, but also by the entire string section of the first orchestra using long, sustained notes and \\"highlighting\\" certain words, thus creating an effect often referred to as Jesus's \\"halo\\". Only his final words, in Aramaic, Eli, Eli lama asabthani? (My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?), are sung without this \\"halo\\". In the revision of 1743‚Äì1746, it is also these words (the Vox Christi) that receive a sustained continuo part. In all prior versions (1727/1729, 1736, and 1742), the continuo part was sustained in all recitatives.  Interpolated texts  The arias, set to texts by Picander, are interspersed between sections of the Gospel text. They are sung by soloists with a variety of instrumental accompaniments, typical of the oratorio style. The interpolated texts theologically and personally interpret the Gospel texts. Many of them include the listener into the action, such as the chorale No. 10, \\"\\" (\\"It is I who should suffer\\"), after eleven disciples asked \\"\\" (Lord, is it I?) ‚Äì meaning: Am I the one going to betray? The alto aria No. 6, \\"\\", portrays a desire to anoint Jesus with her tears out of remorse. The bass aria No. 65, \\"Mache dich, mein Herze, rein\\", offers to bury Jesus himself. Jesus is often referred to as \\"my Jesus\\". The chorus alternates between participating in the narrative and commenting on it. As is typical of settings of the Passion (and originating in its liturgical use on Palm Sunday), there is no mention of the Resurrection in any of these texts (apart from indirect allusions at Matthew 26:32 and 27:53 and 63). Following the concept of Anselm of Canterbury, the crucifixion is the endpoint and the source of redemption; the emphasis is on the suffering of Jesus. The chorus sings, in the final chorale No. 62, \\"tear me from my fears / through your own fear and pain.\\" The bass, referring to the \\"sweet cross\\" expresses in No. 56, \\"Yes, of course this flesh and blood in us / want to be forced to the cross; / the better it is for our soul, / the more bitter it feels.\\" The first \\"\\" chorale compares Jesus' crucifixion to the ritual sacrifice of an Old Testament lamb, as an offering for sin. This theme is reinforced by the concluding chorale of the first part, (O man, bewail your great sin). = Compositional style = Bach's recitatives often set the mood for the particular passages by highlighting emotionally charged words such as \\"crucify\\", \\"kill\\", or \\"mourn\\" with chromatic melodies. Diminished seventh chords and sudden modulations accompany Jesus's apocalyptic prophecies. In the turba parts, the two choruses sometimes alternate in cori spezzati style (e.g. \\"\\") and sometimes sing together (\\"\\"). Other times only one chorus sings (chorus I always takes the parts of the disciples) or they alternate, for example when \\"some bystanders\\" say \\"He's calling for Elijah\\", and \\"others\\" say \\"Wait to see if Elijah comes to help him.\\" In the arias, obbligato instruments are equal partners with the voices, as was customary in late Baroque arias. Bach often uses madrigalisms, as in \\"\\", where the flutes start playing a raindrop-like staccato as the alto sings of drops of his tears falling. In \\"\\", the line about the serpent is set with a twisting melody. In \\"Erbarm es, Gott\\", the relentless dotted rhythm of the diminished chords evoke the emotional shock of the scourging.  Structure  As in other Passion oratorios the backbone of the structure is the narration of the Gospel, in this case chapters 26 and 27 of the Gospel of Matthew in the German translation of the Luther Bible. =Gospel text= The Evangelist, a tenor voice, sings the Gospel text in a declamatory style called secco recitative, that is, with only a continuo accompaniment. Direct speech sections of the Gospel text are brought by other singers in the same \\"secco\\" format (e.g. a soprano voice sings the words spoken by Pontius Pilate's wife), except for: * Vox Christi: the words spoken by Christ are sung by a bass as an accompagnato recitative, that is: accompanied by strings, and in a more arioso style than the secco recitatives. * Turba choruses: words spoken by a group of people (e.g. Jesus' disciples) are sung by the choir, usually accompanied by the complete orchestra. Apart from the Evangelist and the Vox Christi the dramatis personae of these Gospel sections of the St Matthew Passion consists of: * Judas (B), Peter (B), two witnesses (A T), two high priests (B), two maids (S), Pilate (B) and his wife (S) * A small group is represented by Chorus I or Chorus II separately (Chorus I always for the disciples); High priests and larger groups of people are sung by Chorus I and II together. =Interpolated text= In between the sections or scenes of the Gospel text, other texts are sung as a meditation or underlining the action, in a variety of formats: * soloists sing arias, in most cases preceded by an accompagnato recitative, and occasionally in a dialogue with the choir. These sections are based nearly exclusively on texts by Picander. The arias are in da capo format (ternary form). \\"Erbarme dich\\", for alto, and \\"Mache dich, mein Herze, rein\\", for bass, are examples of such arias in Part Two of the oratorio. In these movements the singers are accompanied by one or a few solo instruments and continuo, occasionally completed by other instrument groups of the orchestra.\\"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\\", vocal score * Choral movements come in two additional formats (apart from the turba and dialogue with soloist roles already mentioned above): ** Cornerstone choral movements, or chorale fantasias: these are the extended movements, typically used to open or close both parts of the oratorio. In the St Matthew Passion there are three such extended choral movements: the opening chorus (\\"Kommt, ihr T√∂chter, helft mir klagen\\", text by Picander and Nicolaus Decius), the conclusion of Part One (\\"O Mensch, bewein dein S√ºnde gro√ü\\", text by Sebald Heyden) and the final chorus (\\"Wir setzen uns mit Tr√§nen nieder\\", text by Picander) ** Chorale harmonization movements: using traditional chorale texts and their melodies. The text is sung in homophony by a four-part chorus with colla parte accompaniment by the orchestra. \\"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\\", on a text by Paul Gerhardt, is the one that returns most often throughout the Passion, in different harmonizations. =Overview= In the scheme below indentation indicates the type of movement: |‚Üí Cornerstone choral movements ::|-> Gospel parts (including Vox Christi and Turba sections) ‚Äì Evangelist sings in each of these Gospel sections ::::|-> Chorale harmonizations ::::::|-> (Non-Gospel) Recitatives and Arias (with or without dialogue with the chorus)  Part One  1\\\\.

' (Chorus I & II)  Movements  The work is divided into two parts to be performed before and after the sermon of the Good Friday service. = Part One = The first scenes are in Jerusalem: Jesus announces his death (No. 2), on the other hand the intention to get rid of him is expressed (No. 4). A scene in Bethany (No. 4c) shows a woman anointing his head with valuable oils. The next scene (No. 7) has Judas Iscariot negotiating the price for handing Jesus over. In a great contrast of mood the preparation for the \\"Easter meal\\" (Osterlamm) is described (No. 9) and the Passover meal itself, the Last Supper, foreshadowed by the announcement of betrayal. After the meal they go together to the Mount of Olives (No. 14) where Jesus predicts that Peter will deny him three times before the cock crows. At the garden of Gethsemane (No. 18) Jesus asks his followers several times to support him but they fall asleep while he is praying in agony. It is there (No. 26) that he is betrayed by Judas' kiss and arrested. While soprano and alto mourn (in duet, No. 27a) Jesus's arrest, the chorus make angry interjections ().

The melody of (slaughtered at the stem of the cross), the second line of Decius' chorale, is shown twice in red ink, without the words, on this page of Bach's autograph score: in the middle of the page for the ripienists, and in the upper of the two staves for organ II at the bottom of the page.Koch, Juan Martin. \\"In weiter Ferne, so nah\\" in Neue Musikzeitung, No. 3 of 2014. Part One is opened by the chorus \\"\\" (Come ye daughters, join my lament), on a text by Picander. After 16 measures of instrumental introduction in time, driven by an ostinato rhythm in the basses, Chorus I intones , until in measure 26 they sing (Hark!) and Chorus II promptly asks (Whom?), Chorus I replying with (the bridegroom ‚Äì implying Christ). The next call by Chorus I is (See him!), followed by the question (How?) by Chorus II, to which Chorus I answers (just like a lamb ‚Äì another reference to Christ). The dialogue with these questions is repeated, and then, from measure 30, Chorus I sings the text of the incipit again while in ripieno sopranos sing the first two lines of Nikolaus Decius' chorale \\"\\" (O Lamb of God, innocent) as the cantus firmus. All sentences of the first stanza of Decius' hymn are used as cantus firmus throughout the movement by the ripienists. The opening chorus continues by taking up the questions and answers by Chorus I and II again, now adding: (See it! ‚Äî What? ‚Äì See the endurance) and ultimately (Look! ‚Äî Where? ‚Äî to our guilt), after which Chorus I and II sing the last lines of Picander's text in separate blocks. When the cantus firmus has died out, Chorus I and II return to the first three lines of the text, from measure 82 until the conclusion of the chorus in measure 90.

Part I is closed by a four-part Chorale Fantasia (both choirs) on the chorale (O mankind, mourn your great sins), recapitulating that Jesus was born of the Virgin to \\"become the intercessor\\". The sopranos sing the cantus firmus, the other voices interpret aspects of the narration. In the 1742 and 1743‚Äì1746 versions, a ripieno soprano choir was added to the soprano line. In the 1727/1729 version, this part is concluded by a four-part setting of verse 6 of the Chorale \\"\\". = Part Two = The first scene of Part Two is an interrogation at the High Priest Caiaphas (No. 37) where two witnesses report Jesus having spoken about destroying the Temple and building it again in three days. Jesus is silent to this, but his answer to the question if he is the Son of God is considered a sacrilege calling for his death. Outside in the courtyard (No. 38) Peter is told three times that he belongs to Jesus and denies it three times ‚Äì then the cock crows. In the morning (No. 41) Jesus is sent to Pontius Pilate while Judas is overcome by remorse and kills himself. Pilate interrogates Jesus (No. 43), is impressed and is inclined to release him, as it was customary to release one prisoner for the holiday, supported in this by his wife. But the crowd, given the choice to have Jesus released or Barabbas, a thief, insurrectionist and murderer, asks with one voice \\"Barrabam!\\". They vote to crucify Jesus, Pilate gives in, washing his hands claiming his innocence, and delivers Jesus to torture and crucifixion. On the way to the crucifixion site (No. 55) Simon of Cyrene is forced to carry the cross. At Golgatha (No. 58) Jesus and two others are crucified and mocked by the crowd. Even his last words are misunderstood. Where he cites Psalm 22, \\"Eli, Eli, lama asabthani?\\" (My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?), he is supposed to have called Elijah. He dies. St. Matthew describes the tearing of the Temple curtain and an earthquake ‚Äì set to music by Bach. In the evening (No. 63c) Joseph of Arimathea asks Pilate for the corpse for burial.

Part Two is opened by a dialog between the alto soloist deploring her lost Jesus and choir II offering help in searching for him, quoting Song of Songs 6:1 ().

Chorale This is by far the most unusually chromatic setting of this chorale tune (Befiehl du deine Wege/O Haupt, voll Blut und Wunden) found in the Passion, occurring at the high point of intensity at the death of Jesus. This also marks the completion of Bach's gradual emptying out of the key signature in subsequent settings of this tune: No. 15 has four sharps (E major), No. 17 has three flats (E-flat major), No. 44 has two sharps (D major), No. 54 has one flat (D minor), and No. 62 has no accidentals (A minor).  63\\\\.

The work is closed by a grand scale chorus in da capo form, choir I and II mostly in unison for the first part (We sit down in tears), but in dialog in the middle section, choir II repeating \\"\\" (\\"Rest gently, gently rest!\\"), choir I reflecting: \\"Your grave and headstone shall, for the anxious conscience, be a comfortable pillow and the resting place for the soul. Highly contented, there the eyes fall asleep.\\" These are the last words (before the recapitulation), marked by Bach himself: p pp ppp (soft, very soft, extremely soft).  Reception  The St Matthew Passion was not heard in more or less its entirety outside Leipzig until 1829, when the twenty-year-old Felix Mendelssohn performed a version in Berlin, with the Berlin Singakademie, to great acclaim. Mendelssohn's revival brought the music of Bach, particularly the large-scale works, to public and scholarly attention (although the St John Passion had been rehearsed by the Singakademie in 1822). Sterndale Bennett 1845 edition of the Passion was to be the first of many (as Adolph Bernhard Marx and Adolf Martin Schlesinger's one in 1830), the latest being by Neil Jenkins (1997) and Nicholas Fisher and John Russell (2008). Appreciation, performance and study of Bach's composition have persisted into the present era. =Second half of the 18th century= The Passion was performed under the Cantor of St. Thomas until about 1800.Spitta, Philipp, Johann Sebastian Bach, 3 vols., 1873‚Äì1880, transl. by Clara Bell and J. A. Fuller-Maitland, Novello, London, 1889; repr. Dover, New York, 1952, vol. 2, p. 568; the quote is \\"till the end of the 17th century\\" presumably a misprint for 18th. Specifically, in 1780, the Cantor, Doles, had three of Bach's Passions performed, assumed to include the St. John and St. Matthew, and \\"possibly the St. Luke\\".Spitta, p. 518 =19th century= Performance part for Mendelssohn's 19th-century staging of the St Matthew Passion In 1824 Felix Mendelssohn's maternal grandmother Bella Salomon had given him a copy of the score of the Passion.Applegate 2005, p. 17 Carl Friedrich Zelter had been head of the Sing-Akademie since 1800.Applegate 2005, p. 16 He had been hired to teach music theory to both Felix Mendelssohn and his sister Fanny. Zelter had a supply of J. S. Bach scores and was an admirer of Bach's music but he was reluctant to undertake public performances.An attempt to put on Handel's Judas Maccabeus had recently been \\"botched\\" despite long rehearsals: Applegate 2005, p. 32 When Felix Mendelssohn was preparing his revival performance of the Passion in 1829 in Berlin (the first performance outside Leipzig), he cut out \\"ten arias (about a third of them), seven choruses (about half), [but] only a few of the chorales,\\" which \\"emphasized the drama of the Passion story ... at the expense of the reflective and Italianate solo singing.\\"Applegate 2005, p. 39 In 1827 Felix and a few friends began weekly sessions to rehearse the Passion.Applegate 2005, p. 24 One of the group was Eduard Devrient, a baritone and since 1820 one of the principal singers at the Berlin Royal Opera.Applegate 2005, p. 28 Around December 1828 ‚Äì January 1829 Devrient persuaded Felix that the two of them should approach Zelter to get the Sing- Akademie to support their project. Devrient was especially enthusiastic, hoping to sing the part of Jesus as he eventually did. Zelter was reluctant but eventually gave his approval; that of the Singakademie board followed.Applegate 2005, pp. 30‚Äì33 Once the fuller group of singers and the orchestra were brought in, Devrient recalled, participants were amazed at \\"the abundance of melodies, the rich expression of emotion, the passion, the singular style of declamation, and the force of the dramatic action.\\"Applegate 2005, p. 34 The 20-year-old Felix himself conducted the rehearsals and first two performances by the Singakademie. Their first performance was effectively publicized in six consecutive issues of the Berliner Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung, founded and edited by Adolf Bernhard Marx.Applegate 2005, pp. 36‚Äì37 It took place on 11 March 1829 and was sold out quickly. There was a second performance on 21 March, also sold out. In a third, on 18 April, Zelter conducted, and soon there were performances in Frankfurt (where a previously projected performance of the Passion had been upstaged by those in Berlin) and in Breslau and Stettin.Applegate 2005, p. 43 William Sterndale Bennett became a founder of the Bach Society of London in 1849 with the intention of introducing Bach's works to the English public. Helen Johnston (a student at Queen's College, London) translated the libretto of the Passion, and Bennett conducted the first English performance at the Hanover Square Rooms London on 6 April 1854 (the same year that it appeared in print by the Old Bach Society (Alte Bach-Gesellschaft). The soloists included Charlotte Helen Sainton-Dolby. =20th century= Excerpts of the work were performed on the American television program Omnibus on 31 March 1957 in the episode \\"The Music of J.S. Bach.\\" The presenter and explicator was Leonard Bernstein, who introduced the St Matthew Passion as \\"that glorious work that started me off on my own private passion for Bach.\\"Bernstein, Leonard. Omnibus: The Historic TV Broadcasts on 4 DVDs. E1 Entertainment, 2010. . Bernstein's lecture on Bach was also published in 1959. Bernstein, Leonard. The Joy of Music. Pompton Plains, New Jersey: Amadeus Press, Hal Leonard Corp., 2004 (reprint). . The \\"glorious work\\" quotation is on page 254. The St Matthew Passion has been presented in staged performances. Typically, these are done with all performers in street clothes or neutral costumes, the orchestras on stage, at least the soloists singing without scores from memory, and the words acted out in a solemn, melodramatic fashion with only a minimal stage set. On the other hand, George Balanchine staged it in 1943 with Stokowski conducting, and the Hamburg Ballet presented a Saint Matthew Passion under John Neumeier with Peter Schreier in 1981. Notable staged performances include Jonathan Miller's 1997 production in English. =21st century= Staged productions of the Passion include Lindy Hume's 2005 production for the Perth International Arts Festival, restaged in 2013 for Opera Queensland with , Sara Macliver, Tobias Cole; and Peter Sellars' 2010 production with the Berlin Philharmonic under Simon Rattle with Mark Padmore, Camilla Tilling, Magdalena Ko≈æen√°, Topi Lehtipuu, Christian Gerhaher and Thomas Quasthoff.

As the Malaysian coat of arms descended from that of the Federated Malay States under British colonial rule, it resembles European heraldic designs.  Design  The coat of arms consists of a shield guarded by two supporters as rampant tigers. The shield is topped by a crest consisting of a yellow crescent with a 14-pointed \\"federal star\\", and includes a motto, on a banner, at the bottom. = Crest or helm = The yellow colour of the crest, a crescent and a 14-pointed federal star, symbolises the country's monarchy. The crescent also represents Islam as the official religion while the federal star represents the thirteen states and the Federal Territories of Malaysia. Originally, the fourteen-pointed star represented the original fourteen states of Malaysia, which included Singapore. It was not changed when Singapore left the Federation in 1965, but it has generally been accepted that the 14th point represents the Federal Territories. = Escutcheon = The escutcheon, represented by a shield, is primarily intended to serve as a representation of states unified under the Malaysian federation, and is subdivided into ten divisions. The upper portion or chief of the shield contains five krises on a red background, representing the five former Unfederated Malay States, Johore, Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah and Perlis. The remainder of the shield, which in the coat of arms of Malaya was divided in three per pale (longitudinally) between the former Federated Malay States, Penang and Malacca, is now divided into four sections: * In the dexter (left from the observer's point of view) section is the Pinang palm along with the Penang Bridge representing Penang * In the upper middle of the shield, below the row of krises, are the colours of the Federated Malay States (red, black, white and yellow) arranged from left to right. The permutations of the colours red, black, white and yellow make up the colours of these states' flags. Red, black and yellow are for Negeri Sembilan; black and white for Pahang; black, white and yellow for Perak; and red and yellow for Selangor. * In the lower middle of the shield, there are three sections formerly representing the new (in 1963) states of Sabah, Singapore and Sarawak. Since 1965, Singapore's section has been replaced by a depiction of the national flower, the hibiscus. * In the sinister (right from the observer's point of view) section is the \\"Malacca\\" tree representing Malacca = Supporters = The two rampant tigers supporting the shield are traditional Malay symbols. They are retained from the earlier armorial ensign of the Federation of Malaya, and prior to that of the Federated Malay States. They symbolise strength and courage. = Motto = The motto of the arms, located below the shield, consists of a banner with the phrase \\"Unity is Strength\\" (Bersekutu Bertambah Mutu) written in both romanised Malay and Jawi. The original English phrase was replaced by romanised Malay some time after independence.  History  = Federated Malay States and Malayan Union = The origins of the Malaysian coat of arms can be traced to the formation of the Federated Malay States (FMS) under the colonial rule of the United Kingdom. In conjunction with the introduction of the flag of the Federated Malay States in 1895, the FMS coat of arms was adopted and remained in use from 1895 to the formation of the Federation of Malaya in 1948. The arms, like its modern successors, included a shield, two tigers, and a banner, but depicts an eastern crown on the helm, representing the four sultanates. The shield's design was also significantly simpler; as the FMS consists of only four states, the shield encompassed a quarterly \\"party per cross\\" division representing the colours of the flag of the four FMS (in the same way the flag of the FMS represents the states, and the colours in the modern Malaysian arms represent the same states). The motto was also originally written in Jawi as \\"Dipelihara Allah\\" (Under God's (Allah's) Protection) flanked by two eight-pointed stars. Dipelihara Allah is today the Selangor state motto. While the establishment of the Malayan Union in 1946 brought about the merging of the FMS with the five Unfederated Malay States and two of the Straits Settlements (excluding Singapore), the FMS arms remained in use unchanged as the Union's coat of arms for two years before the Union's dissolution. = Federation of Malaya = The Federation of Malaya arms in use between 1948 and 1963, based heavily on the FMS arms, would serve as the basis of the current Malaysian arms. The founding of the Federation of Malaya in 1948 led to a revision of the arms. Among the changes were a more complete representation the 11 states of the federation on the shield (where new partitions containing insignias of the additional states added over and beside the original FMS colours), the replacement of the eastern crown with a yellow crescent and an 11-pointed federal star (symbols representing the 11 states that were derived from the flag of the Federation of Malaya). The original Jawi motto was also replaced with \\"Unity is Strength\\" in both English and Jawi Malay. At the point of adoption, the shield was composed of the following elements: * In chief, the five krises representing the Unfederated Malay States; * In pale, the quartered colours of the FMS; * In dexter, the Prince of Wales's feathers, crenellation, and waves from the Penang coat of arms; and * In sinister, and gate of A Famosa from the Malaccan coat of arms. = Malaysia = The arms was amended a second time after the formation of Malaysia, with the admission of Singapore and the Borneo states of North Borneo (Sabah) and the Sarawak in 1963. The increased number of states later resulted in the modification of the Federation of Malaya coat of arms to support the three new member states with the widening of the shield. The tigers were redesigned to assume different positions of limbs (front limbs reaching over and behind the shield, and rear limbs reaching over the motto and the shield), and minor adjustments were also made on the appearance of the banner and the length of the crescent, while the 11-pointed federal star was updated to include 14 points. In tandem with the famous person named] as Malaysia's national language, the English motto was replaced with Malay language. During this period of revision, the Malacca's colonial A Famosa insignia was replaced by a Malacca tree. Some of the symbols was modified to eliminate the colonial symbols and other non-Islamic symbols. While other symbols was remained. Penang's Prince of Wales's feathers and crenellation were gradually replaced, by first substituting the feathers with a Pinang palm and, later, the crenellation with the Penang Bridge (which was constructed and completed during the 1980s). Following the expulsion of Singapore in 1965, the coat of arms was redesigned again. In 1988, Sarawak's symbol replaced by the current hornbill-based state arms; similarly, Sabah, which was originally represented by only its flag held up by a pair of arms from its pre-1963 state coat of arms, was revised to fully feature its current state arms in entirely. The Malaysia's version of coat of arms later resulted in a more realistic and aggressive appearance of tigers. The present coat of arms is featured on the flag of Putrajaya - signifying Putrajaya's importance as the new seat of the Malaysian government  Uses  The arms is adopted on several state flags. The Royal Standard of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the flag of the Federal Territories and the flag of Putrajaya all feature the arms charged in the centre largely unmodified.

Battlefleet units in the French Navy (Marine Royale before the French revolution established a republic) were categorised as vaisseaux (literally \\"vessels\\") as distinguished from lesser warships such as frigates (fr√©gates). The vaisseaux were classified according to size and/or firepower into a series of Rangs (ranks), roughly equivalent to the system of Rates used by the British Navy, although these did not correspond exactly. By 1671 there was a system of five Rangs, which officially pertained for over a century; the first three of these Rangs comprised the battlefleet vaisseaux, while the Fourth and Fifth Rangs comprised the larger frigates (\\"fr√©gates-vaisseaux\\" or simply \\"fr√©gates\\"). In practice by the early decades of the 18th century the formal ranking system among the vaisseaux had in practice been overtaken by a division based on the number of carriage guns borne in practice by individual ships. The article is divided into sections according to the Head of State at the time, which names are provided as chronological references. Note that throughout this article the term \\"-pounder\\" refers to French pre-metric units of weight (livres), which were almost 8% greater than UK/US units of the same name; every other maritime power likewise established its own system of weights and each country's 'pound' was different from that of every other nation. Similarly French pre-metric units of length (pieds and pouces) were 6.575% longer than equivalent UK/US units of measurement; the pre-metric French foot was equivalent to 324.8394 mm, whereas the UK/US foot equalled 304.8 mm. These differences should be taken into account in any calculations based on the units given below.  Valois-Angoul√™me dynasty (1515 to 1589)  Fran√ßois I was the first of the five French Kings of the Valois-Angoul√™me dynasty, who reigned from 1515 to 1589: Fran√ßois I (1 January 1515 - 31 March 1547) Henri II (1 April 1547 - 10 July 1559) - second son of Fran√ßois I Fran√ßois II (10 July 1559 - 5 December 1560) - eldest son of Henri II Charles IX (5 December 1560 - 30 May 1574) - third son of Henri II Henri III (30 May 1574 - 2 August 1589) (assassinated) - fourth son of Henri II The application of the Salic Law meant that with the extinction of the Valois in the male line, the Bourbons succeeded to the throne as descendants of Louis IX. Very few of the names of French ships of this era are known. * Grande Fran√ßaise (1533) * Caraquon (1544)  Henri IV (1589 to 1610)  *Lune (1608) ex-Dutch Maan, built 1604 at Amsterdam *Saint Louis (1609) Louis XIII (1610 to 1643) The first seven years of this reign were under the Regency of Marie de M√©dicis, the consort of Henri IV ‚Äì Louis XIII's father, who had been assassinated in 1610. Following the Siege of Saint-Martin-de-R√© and the Siege of La Rochelle, and in line with his general efforts to enhance the prestige and status of France in Europe, the Cardinal de Richelieu had a number of warships purchased from Holland, and eventually built in France by Holland- instructed French engineers. The largest of these early ships of the line, such as the famous 72-gun Couronne launched in 1638, would mount a number of guns comparable to later units of the 18th and 19th century, but the brunt of these ships would mount between 20 and 40 guns. The artillery was also comparatively lighter: the Couronne mounted 18-pounder long guns on her main battery, where any of the numerous 74-gun ships of the line that formed the backbone of the Navy from the late 18th century would mount 36-pounder long guns and 18-pounders would become common on frigates. =Ships of the Line (\\"vaisseaux\\")= * Ours d'Or (purchased 1618 at Middlebourg) - not mentioned after 1624 *Dutch-built vessels ** Pellicorne (or Notre Dame de La Victoire or Saint Marie) (1619) - condemned 1640 ** Saint Esprit (1619) - not mentioned after 1624 ** Galion de Guise (May 1620) - Flagship of the Flotte du Levant 1621-22; accidentally burnt (in combat by French fireship) at Barcelona on 2 July 1642 ** Grand Galion de Malte (loaned May 1621) - returned to the Order of Malta in 1823 * Saint Jean (1621) - disarmed 1637 * Saint Michel (June 1621) - not mentioned after 1623 * Vessels purchased in January 1625 at Blavet from the Order of the Milice Chr√©tienne; on 18 January all five were captured by Huguenot forces in a raid, but were retaken or destroyed by the King's forces later in 1625 ** Saint Basile (1625) - disposal unknown ** Saint Fran√ßois (1625) - destroyed in action 17 September 1625 ** Saint Jean (1625) - converted to fireship 1640 ** Saint Louis de Nevers (1625) - disposal unknown ** Saint Michel (1625) - deleted 1629 When Richelieu decided to renew the French Royal Navy in 1625, he began by ordering a number of warships to be built in Holland, as the French shipbuilding industry was not at that date capable of constructing them in sufficient quentity. However, in the interim, before these new ships could be built, he arranged to fill the gap by leasing or hiring a number of Dutch and English ships. In June 1625 he procured twenty Dutch warships, of which one was lost in action on 16 July and another on 17 September; the remaining eighteen ships were returned to the Dutch on 10 March 1626. In July 1625 he also hired the English Second rate warship Vanguard, and in August added six ships hired from the English East India Company; all these were returned to their owners on 26 May 1626. As these were never at any date owned by the French, they are excluded from the list below. * Corail (1626 in Holland) - not mentioned after 1639 * Europe (1626 in Holland) - condemned 1645 * Fortune (1626 in Holland) - sold January 1650 * Hercule (1626 in Holland) - deleted by 1635 * Licorne (1626 in Holland) - lost off Sardinia 1643 *Vierge 48 (purchased) ‚Äì Captured by the Rochellais, blew up at Ile de R√© on 17 September 1625 * Esp√©rance de Dieu (1627) * Grand Saint Louis (1627) * Navire du Roi 52 guns (1627) - sold in December 1649 and broken up 1650 * Vaisseau de la Reine 40 guns (1627) - wrecked in July 1639 off Morbihan. * Neptune (1628) - a frigate (dragon) * Saint Charles (1628) * Cygne (1629) * Marguerite du Ponant (1629) * Madeleine de Brest (1635) * Saint Louis de Saint Jean de Luz - 3rd Rank ship of 26 guns (1636) - built at Saint-Jean-de Luz (near Biarritz) * Couronne 72 guns (launched 1632 or 1633) - taken to pieces 1643 - 1645 *Amsterdam-built vessels, all begun in 1637 and launched in February 1638 ** Cardinal 42 guns (1638) - taken to pieces in 1662 ** Faucon 26 guns (1638) - deleted May 1661 ** Triomphe 30 guns (1638) - taken to pieces 1662 ** Triton 26 guns (1638) - captured by the English in September 1652 ** Victoire 34 guns (1638) - sank off Naples in October 1654 ** Vierge 34 guns (1638) - wrecked at Messina on 22 November 1650 * Dauphin 24 guns (launched 17 March 1638 at Le Havre) - condemned May 1661 * Lion Couronn√© 28 or 36 guns (1641) - captured by the Spanish 17 June 1651 * Sourdis 34 guns (1641) - deleted May 1661 * Lune class.

The French rating system was historically a division into three Ranks, but a new system of four Ranks was provisionally created in 1669; however a new system quickly replaced this in 1671. Earlier vessels are shown under the rating they were given in 1671 ‚Äì in the case of vessels deleted prior to 1671, these are included according to the rate they would have been given in 1671 had they not been deleted. Under this new system, French major warships were from 1671 divided into five ranks or \\"Rangs\\"; ships of the line (vaisseaux) were divided into the highest three ranks. The original rating system was thoroughly reformed under Colbert's administration two years later, on 24 June 1671, and the overwhelming majority of French warships underwent name changes at that date; vessels are listed below under their original name at time of launching or acquisition, even if they subsequently were better known by the name they were given later. Vessels of the Fourth and Fifth Ranks were categorised as frigates (fr√©gates or fr√©gates-vaisseaux) of the 1st Order and 2nd Order respectively; light frigates (fr√©gates l√©g√®res) and even smaller vessels were excluded from the rating system. =First Rank Ships (\\"vaisseaux de Premier Rang\\")= From 1670, the First Rank could be categorised as ships of the line carrying more than 70 carriage guns (although other factors also played a part in determining what Rank a ship was given); in 1690 this was limit was effectively risen to ships carrying 80 or more guns. Vaisseaux de Premier Rang Extraordinaire The largest and most heavily armed First Rank ships, effectively those carrying 100 carriage guns or more, were placed in a sub- category of Vaisseaux de Premier Rang Extraordinaire. Only a few of these were built, but they always provided the flagships of the two Fleets - the Flotte du Levant (on the Mediterranean coast of France) and the Flotte du Ponant (on the Atlantic and Channel coasts). They were all full three-deckers, i.e. with three full-length gun decks, with the uppermost of these surmounted by an armed forecastle, quarterdeck and poop. *Royal Louis 104 guns (designed and built by Rodolphe G√©d√©on, launched 1 February 1668 at Toulon) ‚Äì renamed Royal Louis Vieux 1692 and broken up 1697. Nominally assigned 120 guns, but never carried more than 104. *Dauphin Royal 100, later 104 guns (designed and built by Fran√ßois Pomet, launched 29 March 1668 at Toulon) ‚Äì broken up 1700 *Royal Duc 104 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched December 1668 at Brest) ‚Äì renamed Reine in June 1671 and broken up 1688 *Soleil Royal 106, later 110 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched 13 December 1669 at Brest) ‚Äì burnt by the English in an action at Cherbourg in June 1692 *Victorieux 108 guns (designed and built by Fran√ßois Pomet, probably launched in late 1675 at Rochefort) ‚Äì broken up 1685 (badly built and never brought into service) *Royal Louis 110 guns (designed and built by Fran√ßois Coulomb snr, launched 22 September 1692 at Toulon) ‚Äì broken up 1727 *Foudroyant 104 guns (designed and built by √âtienne Hubac, launched 24 December 1692 at Brest) ‚Äì exchanged names with Soleil Royal in March 1693 (see below), broken up 1714 *Terrible 100/104 guns (designed and built by Blaise Pangalo, launched 21 February 1693 at Brest) ‚Äì broken up 1714 *Foudroyant 104 guns (designed and built by Blaise Pangalo, launched 14 November 1693 at Brest) ‚Äì originally to have been named Soleil Royal, but exchanged names with Foudroyant in March 1693 (before work on her began), and broken up 1714 Vaisseaux de Premier Rang Ordinaire While the smaller First Rank ships also had three full- length gun decks, the uppermost of these before 1690 generally carried carriage guns only on the forward section and on the after section of that deck, with a section between them in the waist of the ship where no guns were mounted (and no gunports fitted). These ships had no forecastle or poop, so that the two sections of the upper gun deck served the function of forecastle and quarterdeck, while the nominal quarterdeck was short and served in effect the function of a poop. All First Rank ships built from 1689 (until 1740) had three full-length gun decks, usually plus a number of smaller carriage guns mounted on the gaillards (i.e. the quarterdeck, forecastle and possibly a poop deck). Some of the earlier ships built before 1689 received extra guns and gunports fitted in the waist section of their upper deck around 1689, to bring them up to 80 guns or more. *Vend√¥me 72, later 66 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched Spring 1651 at Brest) ‚Äì classed as First Rank in 1669; renamed Victorieux in June 1671 but hulked in the following month and taken to pieces in 1679. In 1660 the 72-gun Vend√¥me was the sole ship which met the criteria of carrying more than 70 guns, and she retained this First Rank status in spite of being later reduced to fewer than 70 guns. *Saint Philippe 78, later 84 guns (designed and built by Rodolphe G√©d√©on, launched 3 February 1663 at Toulon) ‚Äì classed as 1st Rank in 1669; burnt by the English in the Battle of La Hogue in June 1692 *Monarque 84 guns (designed and built by Laurent Coulomb, launched 28 April 1668 at Toulon) ‚Äì broken up 1700 *√éle de France 74/80 guns (designed and built by Louis Audibert, launched 16 February 1669 at Toulon) ‚Äì renamed Lys in June 1671 and broken up 1691 *Couronne 80/82 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched 18 February 1669 at Brest) ‚Äì broken up in 1712 *Paris 72/80 guns (designed and built by Jean Serrin, launched 13 March 1669 at Toulon) ‚Äì renamed Royale Th√©r√®se in June 1671 and broken up in 1692 *Henri 80 guns (designed and built by Jean-Pierre Brun, launched April 1669 at Tonnay-Charente) ‚Äì renamed Souverain in June 1671, then renamed Admirable in June 1678 *Sceptre 80, later 84 guns (designed and built by Laurent Coulomb, launched 11 February 1670 at Toulon) ‚Äì broken up 1692 *Magnanime 70, later 76/80 guns (designed by Rodolphe G√©d√©on and built by Charles Audibert, launched 30 August 1673 at Marseille) ‚Äì driven ashore and burnt in the Battle of Marbella in March 1705 *Admirable 80/84 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched 1678 at Brest) ‚Äì renamed Souverain in June 1678 and broken up 1706 *Grand 84/88 guns (designed and built by Honor√© Malet, launched October 1680 at Rochefort) ‚Äì broken up 1716 or 1717.

Initially during the first part of Louis XIV's reign these were designed and constructed as three-decked ships without forecastles and with minimal quarterdecks, although their upper decks were divided at the waist by an unarmed section of deck; but from about 1670 it was ruled that ships with fewer than 70 guns should not be built with three decks, so all subsequent Third Rank ships were two-decked vessels, i.e. carrying two complete gundecks, usually plus a few smaller carriage guns mounted on the gaillards (the quarterdeck and forecastle). During the first decade of the 18th century, the remaining Second Rank ships with 64 or fewer guns were down-graded (without change of armament) to Third Rank. *Dragon 42 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched 1646 at Brest) - reduced to 34 guns in 1669, hulked 1674 and sold in July 1684 *Mazarin 48, later 42 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched early 1647 at Brest) - renamed Bon in June 1671; wrecked in December 1671 *Reine 56 guns (designed and built by Rodolphe G√©d√©on, launched 9 February 1647 at Toulon) ‚Äì classed as 2nd Rank in 1669, then reduced to 50 guns in 1670 and reclassed as 3rd Rank in 1671; renamed Brave in June 1671 but hulked in 1673 and taken to pieces in 1674. *Br√©z√© 56 guns (designed and built by Rodolphe G√©d√©on, launched 9 October 1647 at Toulon) - wrecked 25 November 1665 at the mouth of the Charente. *C√©sar 56 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched 1648 at Brest) - renamed Rubis in June 1671 and taken to pieces in 1673. *Hercule 42 guns (designed and built by George Carteret and Laurent Hubac, launched 1655 at Brest) - broken up 1673 *Saint Louis 56 guns (designed and built by Jean Laure, launched 3 July 1658 at Soubise) ‚Äì classed as 2nd Rank in 1669, then reduced to 56 guns in 1670 and reclassed as 3rd Rank in 1671; renamed Aimable in June 1671; removed from service in 1688 and taken to pieces in 1690. *Royale 56 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched February 1661 at Brest) ‚Äì reclassed as 3rd Rank in 1670, renamed Ferme in June 1671, condemned 1676 *Chalain or Grand Chalain 42/48 (seized 1661, built 1657 at Concarneau) ‚Äì renamed Triomphe 1662, then Courageux in June 1671; condemned 1672 and broken up *Rubis 60, later 64 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched November 1664 at Brest) ‚Äì captured by the English on 28 September 1666, becoming French Ruby in the English Navy; broken up 1685. *Dauphin 56, later 54 guns (designed by Rodolphe G√©d√©on and built by Fran√ßois Pomet, launched March 1664 at Toulon) ‚Äì renamed Vermandois 1671, then Vigilant 1678; condemned 1699 and broken up 1700 *Diamant 54, later 56 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched December 1664 at Brest) ‚Äì broken up 1685 *Th√©r√®se 60 guns (designed and built by Fran√ßois Pomet, launched 13 March 1665 at Toulon) ‚Äì blew up in action 24 July 1669 *Trident 44, later 54 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched January 1666 at Brest) - renamed Aquilon in June 1671, hulked 1674 and sold in July 1684 *Breton 56 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched 8 February 1666 at Brest) - renamed Courtisan in June 1671; wrecked 1 May 1674 off India *Navarre 56 guns (designed and built by Jean-Pierre Brun, launched June 1666 at Tonnay-Charente) - renamed Constant in June 1671; wrecked June 1673 off India *Comte 50, later 60 guns (designed and built by Jean Nissard, launched 15 January 1667 at Toulon and completed by Rodolphe G√©d√©on) - renamed Prudent in June 1671; hulked 1695 *Lys 60 guns (designed and begun by Laurent Hubac, launched in Spring of 1667 at Brest) - renamed Assur√© in June 1671; sold 1689 *Fleuron 58, later 50 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched early 1668 at Brest) - condemned 1668 *Rouen 52 guns (designed and built by Jean Esnault for the French East India Company, purchased from them in February 1668 and launched 8 February 1666 at Brest) - wrecked 11 September 1670 off Le Havre *Rochefort 56 guns (designed and built by Fran√ßois Pomet, launched May 1669 at Rochefort) - renamed Sage in June 1671; wrecked off Ceuta on 19 April 1692. *Wallon 48, later 50 guns (designed and built by Laurent Hubac, launched 30 August 1669 at Brest) - renamed Duc in June 1671; condemned 1691 *Brave 48, later 54 guns (probably designed and built by Fran√ßois Pomet, launched March 1670 at Rochefort) ‚Äì renamed Prince in June 1671; wrecked in May 1678 *Bourbon Class Designed and built by Laurent Hubac. **Louvre 50 (launched 29 April 1670 at Brest) ‚Äì renamed Bourbon in June 1671; wrecked in May 1678 **Oriflamme 50 (launched 1 November 1670 at Brest) ‚Äì wrecked February 1691 *Alsace 56, later 60 guns (designed by Jean Laure and built by Fran√ßois Pomet, launched 4 October 1670 at Rochefort) - renamed Fier in June 1671; condemned 1695 and broken up before 1700. *Navarrais 56 guns (designed and built by Fran√ßois Pomet, launched 22 November 1670 at Rochefort) ‚Äì renamed Excellent in June 1671; deleted 1676 or 1677. *Furieux 56, later 58 guns (designed and built by Rodolphe G√©d√©on, launched 15 April 1671 at Toulon) ‚Äì renamed Brillant in June 1678; deleted 1687 and broken up 1688 or 1689. *Vaillant Class.

While the five Rangs theoretically remained in existence, the construction by 1715 had crystallised around a number of distinct types, based on the number of carriage guns which they each carried. =First Rank ships (\\"vaisseaux de Premier Rang\\") in the Louis XV era= Three-decker type Only four three-decker ships were completed during this reign of nearly sixty years; a fifth was destroyed before completion. *Foudroyant 110 (launched April 1724 at Brest) ‚Äì condemned 1742 and taken to pieces 1742-43. *Royal Louis 118 (built from 1740 at Brest but never launched ‚Äì burnt by arson while still on the stocks there on 25 December 1742). *Royal Louis 116 (launched May 1759 at Brest) ‚Äì condemned September 1772 and taken to pieces 1773. *Ville de Paris 90 (launched 19 January 1764 at Rochefort) ‚Äì laid down as Imp√©tueux in 1757, renamed January 1762.

Initially these carried just 26 guns - all 36-pounders - in their first (lower deck) battery and 28 guns in their second (upper deck) battery, with 16 guns on the gaillards (quarterdeck and forecastle) - the total of 74 guns being achieved by having 4 small guns (4-pounders) on the 'dunette' (poop); this applied to twelve of the first thirteen vessels listed below. The exception in this group was the 70-gun Aimable, which - while having the same number of ports (except for the poop, where the 4-pounder guns on other ships were never included) - had only 24-pounders in its first (lower deck) battery. The 4-pounders were removed from the poop of all active units of this type by about 1750, reducing each to a 70-gun ship. *Sceptre 74 (launched July 1720 at Brest, designed by √âtienne Hubac) - taken to pieces in 1745. *Bourbon 74 (launched September 1720 at Brest, designed by Laurent Helie) - foundered on 12 April 1741. *Saint Philippe 74 (launched 1722 at Rochefort, designed by Pierre Masson, finished by Blaise Ollivier) - condemned 1745 and taken to pieces in 1746. *Duc d'Orl√©ans Class.

His most famous role was as Sarek, father of the popular character Spock, in the science fiction Star Trek franchise, in both the original and animated series, as well as three films and two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. He also played a Klingon in Star Trek The Motion Picture, and a Romulan in an episode of Star Trek: The Original Series. Biography Lenard was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of a Russian Jewish immigrant, Abraham, and his wife, Bessie, but was raised in the small town of South Haven, Michigan, where his family owned a tourist resort. He joined the United States Army in 1943 and trained to be a paratrooper during World War II but did not see combat and was discharged in 1946 as a technical sergeant. He got his start on stage while in the army. After earning a master's degree in theater and speech from the University of Michigan, he became known in New York City for serious drama, including Ibsen, Shaw, and Chekov. His first notable role was that of Conrad in John Gielgud's production of Much Ado About Nothing. In the mid-1960s, he moved his family to Los Angeles, where he played one of the Three Wise Men in the biblical epic The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965). Lenard is best known for his appearances in the Star Trek franchise, particularly in the role of Sarek, the father of Spock (Leonard Nimoy). However, his first Star Trek appearance was in the first season of Star Trek: The Original Series, playing the first Romulan ever seen in the series, in the episode \\"Balance of Terror\\" (1966). He originated the character of Sarek in the second-season episode \\"Journey to Babel\\" (1967), and provided the voice of Sarek in the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \\"Yesteryear\\" (1973). He later played an ill-fated Klingon Captain in Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), which gave him the distinction of being the first actor to play a Romulan, a Vulcan, and a Klingon in Star Trek. He reprised the role of Sarek in three of the Star Trek feature films: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984), Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986), and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), and provided the voice of young Sarek in a brief flashback sequence in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989). Additionally, he appeared as the elderly Sarek in the third-season Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Sarek\\" (1990) and the fifth-season episode \\"Unification: Part 1\\" (1991). Lenard's work outside the Star Trek franchise included playing the prosecutor in Fort Grant in the Clint Eastwood film Hang 'Em High (1968). He also played the character Aaron Stempel in the television series Here Come the Brides, and the hostile gorilla Urko in the television series Planet of the Apes. He made a guest appearance on Little House on the Prairie in the episode \\"Journey in the Spring, Part I\\", playing Peter Ingalls, older brother of Charles Ingalls. He had roles in Gunsmoke several times, including in the episode \\"Nowhere to Run\\" (1968). Lenard guest-starred in several episodes of the original Mission: Impossible, including one with Leonard Nimoy, and in a two-part episode of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Lenard played a lead role in the film Noon Sunday, filmed on Guam with costars Keye Luke, TV series star John Russell from Lawman, and character actor Stacy Harris. In The Radicals (1990), which recounted the beginnings of the Swiss Anabaptist movement in the 1520s, he played a composite historical character, Eberhard Hoffman, a Catholic bishop who serves as prosecutor in the trial of his former abbot Michael Sattler. In 1993, Lenard and fellow Star Trek actor Walter Koenig toured in a production of The Boys in Autumn. Lenard played a late middle-aged Huck Finn who re-encounters his childhood friend Tom Sawyer after a lifetime apart. Koenig played Sawyer. Lenard died of multiple myeloma in New York City in 1996 at the age of 72.

(the name means the \\"wolf clan\\") was a powerful clan in Beowulf, Widsith and in the Norse sagas. While the poet of Beowulf does not locate the Wulfings geographically, Scandinavian sources define the Ylfings (the Old Norse form of the name) as the ruling clan of the Eastern Geats. The Wulfings play an important role in Beowulf as Beowulf's father Ecg√æeow of the W√¶gmunding clan had slain one of its members, and was banished for not paying the weregild. The Danish king Hro√∞gar, who was married to Wealh√æeow, a Wulfing woman, graciously paid the weregild, and when Beowulf arrived at the Danish court in order to slay Grendel, Hro√∞gar interpreted this as a son's gratitude. In Old Norse sources, the clan figure prominently in the Heimskringla and in S√∂gubrot, where Hj√∂rvard and his son Hj√∂rmund belong to it. It is also mentioned in the Lay of Hyndla and in Sk√°ldskaparm√°l where Eir√≠kr the Wise was one of its members. However, its most famous member was Helgi Hundingsbane who had two poems of his own (Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana I and Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana II), in the Poetic Edda, and whose story is also retold in the V√∂lsunga saga. Sam Newton and others (including Rupert Bruce- Mitford), have proposed that the East Anglian Wuffing dynasty was derived from the Wulfings, and it was at their court that Beowulf was first composed. Location According to the Norse sagas, the Wulfings ruled the Geatish petty kingdom of √ñsterg√∂tland. In the first poem (Helgakvi√∞a Hundingsbana I), Sinfj√∂tli has his residence on the Br√°vellir (see Battle of the Br√°vellir). Stanza 42: { :Sinfiotli qva√æ: :¬´√ûv vart brv√ær Grana :a Bravelli, :gvllbitlv√æ vart :gor til rasar; :hafda ec √æer mo√æri :mart scei√æ ri√æit, :svangri vnd sa/√æli, :simvl! forbergis.¬ª :Sinfjotli quoth: :\\"You were the bride of Grani the horse :you were at Br√°vellir; :harnessed with a golden bridle, :and you were ready to run; :I have ridden you tired downhill :quite often, :slim, as you were, :under the saddle you fool!\\" |} Helgi Hundingsbane resides at Hringsta√∞ir (probably modern Ringstad, an old royal estate on the same plain). In the Heimskringla, H√∂gni was the ruler of √ñsterg√∂tland. The legends of Helge Hundingsbane relate that H√∂gni lost his throne to Helgi Hundingsbane. On the other hand, S√∂gubrot relates that Ivar Vidfamne gave the East Geatish throne to Hj√∂rmund, the son of Hj√∂rvard, after Ingjald's death since it had been the kingdom of Hj√∂rmund's father Hj√∂rvard. :Hann setti konunga ok jarla ok l√©t ser skatta gjalda; han setti Hj√∂rmund konung, on Hervardar Ylfings, yfir Eystra-Gautland, er √°tt haf√∞i fa√∞ir hans ok Granmarr konungr. However, this contradicts both the legend of Helge Hundingsbane and the Heimskringla in which the dynasty never lost √ñsterg√∂tland, unless Ivar killed either H√∂gne or Helgi Hundingsbane before giving the throne to their relative Hj√∂rmund.

The second son of the Xuande Emperor, he was selected in 1449 to succeed his elder brother Emperor Yingzong of Ming (then reigned as \\"Zhengtong Emperor\\"), when the latter was captured by Mongols following the Tumu Crisis. He reigned for 8 years before being removed from the throne by his elder brother Emperor Yingzong of Ming (then reigned as \\"Tianshun Emperor\\"). The Jingtai Emperor's era name, \\"Jingtai\\", means \\"Exalted View\\".  Early life  The future Jingtai Emperor was born on September 21, 1428 with the name Zhu Qiyu. On August 3, 1449, he was appointed regent by his older half-brother the Zhengtong Emperor. Zhu Qiyu would ascend the throne in 1449 after his older brother, the Zhengtong Emperor was defeated and taken prisoner by the Oirat Mongols of Esen Khan. Reign During his reign, aided by the able minister Yu Qian, Jingtai paid particular attention to matters affecting his country. He repaired the Grand Canal as well as the system of dykes along the Yellow River. As a result of his administration, the economy prospered and the dynasty was further strengthened. The Zhengtong Emperor was released in 1450 after the Mongols learned that the Ming government had installed Zhu Qiyu as the new emperor. After that, Jingtai continued to rule as emperor while his brother was granted the title of Retired Emperor and lived in obscurity. = Deposition and Death = Jingtai reigned for eight years. When his death was imminent in 1457, he refused to name an heir, particularly because his own son had died mysteriously ‚Äî perhaps poisoned. The sidelined Zhengtong Emperor saw an opportunity to regain the throne and through a military coup overthrew the Jingtai Emperor. Zhengtong adopted a new era name, \\"Tianshun\\", and is henceforth known as the Tianshun Emperor. Jingtai was demoted to the Prince of Cheng, the title he had held before ascending the throne, and was placed under house arrest in Xiyuan (Ë•øËãë).Present day Zhongnanhai to the west of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Jingtai died a month later with some sources hinting that he was murdered by eunuchs on the order of the Tianshun Emperor. After the Jingtai Emperor's death, the Tianshun Emperor denied his brother's rightful honor to be buried at the Ming Dynasty Tombs (together with his predecessors) located north of Beijing. He was instead buried well away from that locale in the hills west of Beijing and was buried as a prince rather than an emperor. His posthumous name was also shortened to five characters, instead of the normal seventeen, to reflect his demoted status.

They have won awards from several organisations for their friendly behaviour and charitable work. They have also been criticised at times for aspects of their behaviour, however, such as jeering at \\"God Save the Queen\\".  History  The Tartan Army in Milan, Italy Scotland fans at the Stadio San Nicola in Bari for a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match against Italy. Tartan is part of the symbolic national dress of Scotland, and the name Tartan Army first came into common usage in the 1970s, to describe the \\"well-refreshed hordes\\" who would stand on the terracings at Hampden Park, or biannually at Wembley for the England match. Scotland fans were criticised at that time for their hooliganism, particularly after they invaded the Wembley pitch and destroyed the goalposts after the 2‚Äì1 win against England in 1977. p77 Two years later, 349 arrests were made and a further 144 fans were ejected from Wembley Stadium during the 1979 British Home Championship match, mainly for drunk and disorderly behaviour and vandalism. The behaviour in that latter match prompted the Scottish Sports Minister Alex Fletcher to apologise to colleagues and led to the creation of the Scotland Travel Club. The Scotland Travel Club was established in 1980 with the expressed purpose of encouraging responsible behaviour by fans. It has been suggested by Professor Eric Dunning that the improvement in behaviour arose mainly from a desire to look better than the English fans, who experienced significant problems with hooliganism during the 1980s and 1990s. The Tartan Army have won a number of awards for their vocal support and friendly nature. The organisation of the Travel Club had an immediate impact, with the Scotland matches at the 1982 FIFA World Cup being played in a \\"family atmosphere\\". The Tartan Army were named as the best supporters during the 1992 European Championship and also received an award for their behaviour at the 1998 World Cup in France. BBC News described the Scotland fans as \\"one of the highlights\\" of that World Cup, noting their colourful appearance. Matches against England, which used to be played on an annual basis as part of the British Home Championship, were eventually stopped after 1989 due to violence and organised hooliganism. Both matches that were played between the countries in November 1999 in qualification for UEFA Euro 2000 had associated problems. Strathclyde Police made 230 arrests in connection with the tie played at Hampden, while trouble at the second leg in Wembley resulted in 56 supporter injuries and 39 arrests. Police spokesmen downplayed the incidents after both games, however. Comments after the first game indicated that the arrests were for minor public order offences and that the scale of violence witnessed was lower than a typical Friday evening in Glasgow. The Metropolitan Police adopted a \\"zero tolerance\\" approach for the second game, but the number of arrests were \\"comparatively small\\" and the \\"vast majority\\" of supporters were well behaved. =21st century= The Tartan Army were awarded a Fair Play prize by the Belgian Olympic Committee after a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier in Brussels. The fans had been praised by the mayor of Zagreb for their behaviour after a match against Croatia in the same competition. In April 2002, during the joint bid by Scotland and Ireland to host the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament, First Minister of Scotland Jack McConnell cited the \\"worldwide reputation\\" of the Tartan Army as a strength of the bid, stating that other countries welcome their arrival \\"with open arms\\". In 2005, the Scotland Travel Club became the Scotland Supporters Club, with sections for younger fans being established. Membership had grown to 17,000 by this time. The UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying campaign saw membership numbers increase dramatically to a capacity of 27,500, with a waiting list of over 10,000. The Scotland Supporters Club is operated by the Scottish Football Association, with membership guaranteeing one match ticket for all home fixtures and offering the opportunity to apply for away match tickets. As of August 2010, the club is at its maximum capacity of 35,000 members and therefore does not accept applications. In August 2008, Irish Football Association chief executive Howard Wells criticised jeering from Scottish supporters during the British National Anthem, \\"God Save the Queen\\", before a friendly international match against Northern Ireland. The SFA, who had pleaded with fans not to jeer the anthem, admitted that they were also \\"disappointed\\" by the booing. The Scottish Government also criticised the Tartan Army, commenting that it had \\"tarnished\\" their reputation. Scotland were not punished for the booing because the match was a friendly, which fell outside the jurisdiction of UEFA. \\"God Save the Queen\\" was previously used as the Scottish team's anthem, but it was replaced during the 1970s due to consistent booing at matches. \\"Scotland the Brave\\" was initially used as a replacement, with \\"Flower of Scotland\\" being commonly used since 1990. This issue recurred when Scotland played Liechtenstein in September 2010, as their national anthem uses the tune of \\"God Save the Queen\\". SFA acting chief executive George Peat publicly apologised for a section of the fans jeering the anthem. It was again booed when Scotland played Northern Ireland in the 2011 Nations Cup. The Tartan Army has been a consistent opponent of the concept of a Great Britain team, particularly its participation in the 2012 Olympic Games, due to concerns that such participation would endanger the separate status of Scotland within international football.  Composition  Research carried out in 1996 noted that the proportion of the Tartan Army comprising Rangers supporters, \\"traditionally the backbone of the Tartan Army\\", had declined since the 1980s. However, Rangers still provided the single largest proportion with 21%, while west-of-Scotland Catholics, traditionally associated with Celtic, were still notably under-represented. Politically, the Scottish National Party enjoyed the support of almost two in five Tartan Army members.  Charitable work  The Tartan Army received a nomination in the inaugural International Scot Award, as part of The Herald newspaper's Scottish Politician of the Year ceremony, for their charitable work. The Tartan Army Children's Charity (TACC) and Tartan Army Sunshine Appeal (TASA) are both registered Scottish charities run by Scotland fans, raising money for disadvantaged children in Scotland and in the countries visited by fans following the team. The Sunshine Appeal was first launched after a Scotland away fixture against Bosnia in 2000, when group of fans were introduced to Kemal Karic, a local boy who had lost his leg in the shelling of Sarajevo. TASA's aim is to make a donation in every country where Scotland play a game, which they've done since 2003 on 50 consecutive away games. TACC has donated funds to projects for disabled and blind children in Ukraine, Georgia and North Macedonia. In 2009, ¬£30,000 was donated to each of two projects in South Africa, where the Tartan Army had hoped to visit for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The TACC, which is the nominated charity of the SFA, also organise trips for disadvantaged Scottish children to watch Scotland play at Hampden Park. TACC's main fundraising events are a lottery monthly lottery and the TACC Kiltwalk, an annual 26-mile sponsored walk from Hampden Park to Loch Lomond.  Official tartan  The Tartan Army tartan Prior to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Ian and Alan Adie, two Glasgow businessman, trademarked the name \\"Tartan Army\\" in 1997. They approached the Scottish Tartans Authority to assist in creating a tartan. Keith Lumsden designed the corporate tartan on their behalf and it was registered on 1 March 1997 under number 2389 with both the Scottish Tartans Authority (STA) and the Scottish Tartans World Register (STWR). It is mostly Balmoral Blue and Torea Bay , with Freedom Red , Gainsboro White , and Golden Poppy . The Scottish Tartans Society notes that the design was taken originally from Royal Stewart and modified having Black Watch added as a background. It was first seen in common use at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

The mills lie in the London Borough of Newham; and, despite lying on the Newham side of the Lea, access is principally from the western, London Borough of Tower Hamlets, side of the river. The River Lea Tidal Mill Trust Ltd owns the House Mill and the Miller's House buildings, which are used for educational projects and as conference spaces. The Lower Lea Project is also based at Three Mills in The Miller's House. History It is thought that there were eight or possibly nine mills on the River Lea in Stratford at the time of the Domesday Book (though this number may refer to the number of pairs of millstones rather than buildings). These are the earliest recorded examples of a tidal mill system. In the clock mill there were 16 workers. Stratford Langthorne Abbey, founded in 1135, acquired Three Mills some time in the 12th or 13th centuries, and the local area became known by the name. By the time Henry VIII dissolved the abbey in the 1530s, the mills were grinding flour for the bakers of Stratford-atte-Bow, who were celebrated for the quality of their bread and who supplied the huge City of London market. In 1588, one of the mills was described as a \\"gunpowder mill\\". During the 16th century the three mills were reduced to two (which today are the House Mill and the Clock Mill). In the 17th century, the mills were used to grind grain, which was then used to distill alcohol; the mills became a major supplier to the alcohol trade and gin palaces of London. The House Mill was built in 1776 (and after a fire destroyed it, quickly rebuilt) by Daniel Bisson. It is a grade I listed building. The Clock Mill was rebuilt by Philip Metcalfe between 1815 and 1817 incorporating the old clock, and an older bell. There was also a windmill which survived until about 1840. The House Mill continued to operate until 1940 and the Clock Mill until 1952. 261x261px Ownership changed relatively frequently during the 17th to the late 19th centuries, until 1872 when it was purchased by gin distillers J&W; Nicholson & Co of Clerkenwell. Initially producing Lamplighter Gin on site, the company eventually moved production of all of their brands to the site. Distilling ceased in 1941 during the rationing shortages of World War II. The Nicholson family, headed by Sir Richard Nicholson, sold the business to the Distillers Company. 258x258px Three Mills sustained severe air-raid damage during the Second World War. The Miller's House was destroyed in 1941 and rebuilt in 1995 with a modern interior and rear part, but retaining the original facade. Three Mills was used for bottling and warehousing by Bass Charrington and Hedges & Butler. The latter, one of the oldest wine merchants in Britain located their main working offices at Three Mills. Here, Bacardi was bottled and a large portfolio of wines and spirits was marketed. The House Mill remains the largest tidal mill in the world, although the water wheels are currently not in operation. The building is owned by The River Lea Tidal Mill Trust Ltd and is open to visitors on Sunday afternoons during the summer. It is one of only four Grade I listed buildings in the London Borough of Newham. The creation of the Three Mills Lock on the Prescott Channel and the Three Mills Wall River Weir, for the 2012 Summer Olympics construction work, has created a head of water behind the mill. This may mean that it can be operated again although it has partially removed the tidal benefits of the site. The Clock Mill is the temporary site of East London Science School. In 2017, J&W; Nicholson re- launched the gin brand which was launched in 1736 as Nicholson Gin. Three Mills Island 255x255px Three Mills Island is in Bromley-by-Bow in east London. It forms part of the 50-mile Lea Valley Walk celebrated in The Telegraph, The Guardian and The Newham Recorder. The Prescott Channel, a former flood relief channel passes to the east, making the land an island. The mills share Three Mills Island with the 3 Mills Studios, a 10-acre film and TV studio, which makes a large number of major films and television programmes and an open green and play area called Three Mills Green. The 26-acre area of land opposite the mills, shown in historical surveys as the Three Mills District, once housed a large cooperage producing barrels to support the mills, as well as a wide range of industries, from the manufacture of innovative inks to sugar refining. Called Sugar House Island, the development is being delivered by Vastint and will bring 2,500 jobs to the area, with a new business district as well as waterside homes and amenity.  Operation  255x255px In 1878 there were seven waterwheels at Three Mills. Most of them were around 20 ft in diameter and 3 ft in width, but one was 8 ft in width. There were four in the House Mill and three in the Clock Mill. They drove fourteen pairs of millstones and produced a total of 150 HP (112KW). The average output of the House Mill was about 2 tons of maize and 5 tons of barley per tide rising to 10 and 14 tons respectively on spring tides. The average weekly throughput of the two mills was 125 tons per week. Clock Mill was powered by three iron undershot water wheels, two of 6.1m diameter and one of 5.9m diameter. These wheels drove six pairs of millstones at 130 revolutions per minute. This mill operated until 1952.

He played three matches for Scotland between 1881 and 1882. Arthur Wharton was commonly thought to be Britain's first black player, as he was the first black professional footballer and the first to play in the Football League, but Watson's career predated him by over a decade. Early life and education Watson was the son of a wealthy Scottish sugar planter Peter Miller Watson (1805‚Äì1869) (the son of James Watson, of Crantit, Orkney, Scotland) and a local British Guianese woman named Hannah Rose. He came to Britain with his father, and his older sister Annetta, and they inherited a substantial amount when their father died in London in 1869.Watson, Andrew (1856‚Äì1921) Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2014; accessed 13 March 2015 He was educated at Heath Grammar School in Halifax, West Yorkshire and then from 1871 at King's College School, in Wimbledon, London, where records show he excelled at sports including football. He later studied natural philosophy, mathematics and engineering at the University of Glasgow when he was 19, where his love of football blossomed. He played in the full back position, on either the right or the left flank. Private life and career Watson left Glasgow University after one year and in 1877 became a partner in Watson, Miller, and Baird, a wholesale warehouse business in Glasgow. In November 1877 he married Jessie Nimmo Armour (1860‚Äì1882); she was the daughter of John Armour, a cabinet- maker. Their son Rupert Andrew was born in 1878, and a daughter Agnes Maude in 1880. Watson moved to London with his family in the summer of 1882 for work reasons. His wife died in the autumn of 1882 and their two children returned to Glasgow to live with their grandparents. He returned to Glasgow and married for a second time, to Eliza Kate Tyler (1861‚Äì1949) in February 1887. She was the daughter of Joseph Tyler, East India merchant. Later that year he moved to Liverpool, where he worked on ships and sat exams to qualify as a marine engineer. Watson and Eliza had two children, a son Henry Tyler in 1888 and a daughter Phyllis Kate in 1891. Football career =Club career= After first playing for Maxwell in 1876, Watson signed for local side Parkgrove, where he was additionally their match secretary, making him the first black administrator in football. At Parkgrove he played alongside another black player, Robert Walker. He also took part in athletics competitions, winning the high jump on several occasions. On 14 April 1880, he was selected to represent Glasgow against Sheffield; Glasgow won 1‚Äì0 at Bramall Lane. He was also selected for a tour to Canada in the summer of 1880 which was cancelled after the death of William Dick, secretary of the Scottish Football Association. In April 1880, he also signed for Queen's Park ‚Äì then Britain's largest football team ‚Äì and became their secretary in November 1881. He led the team to several Scottish Cup wins, thus becoming the first black player to win a major competition. Watson's entry in the Scottish Football Association Annual of 1880‚Äì81 reads as follows: :\\"Watson, Andrew: One of the very best backs we have; since joining Queen's Park has made rapid strides to the front as a player; has great speed and tackles splendidly; powerful and sure kick; well worthy of a place in any representative team.\\" In 1882, he moved to London and became the first black player to play in the English Cup when he turned out for Swifts. In 1883, he was the first foreign player to be invited to join the leading amateur club in England, the Corinthians. During his time there, this included an 8‚Äì1 victory against Blackburn Rovers, who were at that time the English Cup holders. He also played for other amateur English clubs, including Pilgrims, Brentwood, and London Caledonians. The colour of his skin was of no significance to his peers, and there is no historical record of racism on the part of the Scottish Football Association. One match report is more interested in Watson's unusual brown boots rather than the customary black boots of that time. As written in the minutes, before one match where Watson was injured and unable to play, an SFA vice-president said if Watson had been fit he would have happily drugged a fellow Scottish international to give Watson his place. He played his last match for Queen's Park in 1886. Paul McDonald, writing for the BBC, noted: \\"Payments to players had been made legal in England in 1885 and professional footballers were paid decent salaries for that time. Ironically this attracted many Scottish players southwards to ply their trade in England, whereas in Scotland the game remained, in theory anyway, an amateur game until 1893.\\" Professionalism Watson signed for Merseyside club Bootle in 1887. Bootle offered wages and signing fees to a number of players, and research by Tony Onslow outlined in The Forgotten Rivals. A history of Bootle Football Club indicates that Watson was paid professionally.The Forgotten Rivals. A history of Bootle Football Club. Tony Onslow. Countrywise Publication. 2005. This means that Watson's professional career would predate the professional career of Arthur Wharton, who was previously considered to be the first black footballer to play professionally. Onslow writes that Watson was Bootle's star signing and that the club pulled off the biggest coup in Merseyside by signing the Scotland international player. When Bootle was drawn with a Smethwick side Great Bridge Unity F.C., the Midlands club received a telegram from a 'Smith of Oakfield' who stated that Bootle's Watson and another Scottish player Anderson were being paid - and as such should be ineligible for their tie.The Forgotten Rivals. A history of Bootle Football Club. Tony Onslow. Countrywise Publication. 2005. Watson and others were in the Bootle side that beat Unity 2-1; and so directly after the match Unity lodged a complaint with the F.A. The F.A. announced that they would let Bootle proceed to the next round; but they would instead launch an investigation into the club.The Forgotten Rivals. A history of Bootle Football Club. Tony Onslow. Countrywise Publication. 2005. Onslow writes: > Bootle Football Club now faced a local FA committee on charge of paying a > certain number of their players. Dr. Morley of Blackburn, President of the > northern branch, chaired the meeting that took place at the Crompton Hotel > in Liverpool. Also present was Morton P. Betts from the London executive and > all the prominent members of the Liverpool and District F.A. committee. > Former Bootle players Izatt and Weir were called to give evidence before the > adjourned and referred the matter to London. The club was found guilty by the F.A.; but the F.A. punishment was lenient - they had that same season closed Anfield for a month when Everton similarly paid players - and Bootle escaped with a mere caution.The Forgotten Rivals. A history of Bootle Football Club. Tony Onslow. Countrywise Publication. 2005. =International career= Watson won three international caps for Scotland. His first cap came for Scotland in a match against England in London on 12 March 1881, in which he captained the side.The Times, 14 March 1881, p.6, col C Scotland won 6‚Äì1, which (as of 2019) is still a record home defeat for England. A few days later, Scotland played Wales and won 5‚Äì1. Watson's last cap came against England in Glasgow on 11 March 1882. This was a 5‚Äì1 victory again to Scotland. Watson moved to London in the summer of 1882, which effectively ended his international career as the SFA only picked players based in Scotland at this time. The next non-white person to receive a full international cap for Scotland was Paul Wilson in 1975. The next black person selected to play for Scotland after Andrew Watson was Nigel Quashie in 2004, 120 years later. Later life and tributes Watson retired to London in around 1910 and died of pneumonia at 88 Forest Road, Kew, in 1921. He is buried in Richmond Cemetery. In 1926 the sportswriter \\"Tityrus\\" (the pseudonym of J. A. H. Catton, editor of the Athletic News) named Andrew Watson as left- back in his all-time Scotland team.Catton, J. A. H.

That chronicle implies that they were neither his relatives nor of noble blood. Map of Kievan Rus in the 9th century Primary Chronicle The Primary Chronicle relates that Askold and Dir were sanctioned by Rurik to go to Constantinople (Norse Miklag√•rd, Slavic Tsargrad). When travelling on the Dnieper, they saw a settlement on a mountain and asked to whom it belonged. They were told that it was Kyiv and had been built by three brothers named Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv, who were the ancestors of the inhabitants, who were now paying tribute to the Khazars. Askold and Dir settled in the town and gathered a large number of fellow Varangians and began to rule the town and the land of the eastern Polans. The chronicle also states that they were killed by Oleg the Seer around 882,Many scholars believe the conquest of Kiev took place a generation later; see Oleg of Novgorod for discussion of the controversy surrounding this date. yet they were buried in various places. According to the Primary Chronicle Oleg tricked and killed Askold and Dir using an elaborate scheme. Vasily Tatischev, Boris Rybakov and some other Russian historians interpreted the 882 coup d'√©tat in Kiev as the reaction of the pagan Varangians to Askold's baptism. Tatischev went so far as to style Askold \\"the first martyr of Rus'\\". Tale of Ragnar's Sons According to Olof von Dalin, Askold (as Asleik Bjornson (Diar)) was the son of Bj√∂rn Ironside,Von der Chronistik zur modernen Geschichtswissenschaft: Die War√§gerfrage in der russischen, deutschen und schwedischen Historiographie (Veroffentlichungen Des Osteuropa-instituts Munchen, Band 5) Taschenbuch ‚Äì 1.

Other researchers believe that Askold was the son of HvitserkAdolf Stender-Petersen, Heinrich Bach.

C. 93-107. another son of Ragnar. Hvitserk was a contemporary of Rurik, and was said to have waged a war of conquest in Eastern Europe. Al-Masudi The only foreign source to mention one of the co-rulers is the Arab historian Al-Masudi. According to him, \\"king al-Dir [Dayr] was the first among the kings of the Saqaliba [Slavs].\\" Although some scholars have tried to prove that \\"al-Dir\\" refers to a Slavic ruler and Dir's contemporary, this speculation is questionable and it is at least equally probable that \\"al-Dir\\" and Dir were the same person.Golden, P.B. (2006) \\"Rus.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam (Brill Online). Eds.: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill. The theory has been voiced that in Old East Slavic it was originally \\"askold Dir\\" and not \\"Askold i Dir\\" as it is known from the Primary Chronicle. K.J.Erben believed that the word askold or oskold was derived from Old Norse √≥skyldr meaning strange, so there was probably a ruler of Kiev called Dir by the Slavs and the Varangians called him something like \\"√≥skyldr Dyri\\"‚Äîstranger Dir. The Varangians of Kievan Rus later forgot the meaning of √≥skyldr so Nestor wrote about two rulers of Kiev ‚Äî about Askold and Dir.The interpretation of name Oskold/Askold is mentioned in the K.J.Erben's translation of the Primary Chronicle into Czech language. Facts and records The Rus' attack on Constantinople in June 860 took the Greeks by surprise, \\"like a thunderbolt from heaven,\\" as it was put by Patriarch Photios in his famous oration written for the occasion. Although the Slavonic chronicles tend to associate this expedition with the names of Askold and Dir (and to date it to 866), the connection remains tenuous. Despite Photius' own assertion that he sent a bishop to the land of Rus' which became Christianized and friendly to the Eastern Roman Empire, most historians discard the idea of Askold's subsequent conversion as apocryphal. A Kievan legend identifies Askold's burial mound with Uhorska Hill, where Olga of Kiev later built two churches, devoted to Saint Nicholas and to Saint Irene. Today this place on the steep bank of the Dnieper is marked by a monument called Askold's Grave.

A former lighthouse tender, she sailed from the Black Sea to Palestine in early 1941. Ship history =Early career= The ship was built by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Glasgow in 1892 for the Northern Lighthouse Board and served as a tender, named Pole Star, based at Stromness. She was renamed Orphir in 1931, and then sold to William Marshall of Glasgow for conversion to a salvage ship under the same name. In 1933 she was again sold to James M. Stewart of Glasgow, and finally in 1939 sold to P. Svolakis & Co., of Piraeus, Greece, renamed Sophia S, and registered at Col√≥n, Panama. =Aliya Bet= In May 1940 the ship was purchased in Piraeus by Moshe Agami and Shmarya Zameret for $40,000. Zameret, who was a U.S. citizen, was the registered owner, and renamed the ship Darien II, still registered under the Panamanian flag. Both men were members of Mossad LeAliyah Bet, a branch of Haganah that organised illegal Jewish emigration from Europe to the British Mandate of Palestine. They planned to take the Darien II to a port in Yugoslavia to rescue 822 Jews from Poland, Germany and Austria, who had attempted to leave Europe in the ship Uranus via the Danube, but had been stranded at Kladovo on the Romanian/Yugoslav border. This plan was abandoned after the entry of Italy into the war in June 1940 made entering the Adriatic too dangerous. The ship then became involved in a struggle between two branches of Haganah, one dedicated to bringing Jewish refugees from Europe to Palestine in defiance of British restrictions, and the other actively co-operating with the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) to provide Jewish agents to carry out acts of sabotage and intelligence gathering in enemy territory. Various plans were put forward for the ship. Eliyahu Golomb suggested using her to simultaneously infiltrate agents and rescue Jewish refugees in Romania. Another suggestion was to sink the ship at the mouth of the Danube, blocking the entrance. A third plan involved occupying the port of Constan»õa, Romania, and appears to have received some support from the Royal Navy. Eventually the ship was sold to SOE for ¬£15,000 to operate in the Balkans in cooperation with Haganah, though Zameret remained the registered owner and the ship remained under the control of Mossad LeAliyah Bet. In August 1940 the Darien II sailed to Alexandria, then to Istanbul, and finally arrived at Constan»õa in November. There refugees from Romania and Poland boarded, and the ship sailed to Sulina where more refugees were expected. She waited until the end of December, but when they did not arrive, the ship finally left. On the return voyage to Constan»õa the Darien II hit a reef and had to be towed to a dry-dock for repairs. On 17 February 1941 Darien II left Constan»õa with 460 refugees on board, arriving at Varna, Bulgaria, the next day. When the Bulgarian authorities arrested the ship's captain, Olaf Bergenson, a former Norwegian naval officer, was appointed to command. On 28 February the ship sailed from Varna with 750 refugees aboard, arriving in Istanbul on 2 March. More refugees were embarked there bringing the total up to 792, which included survivors from the Salvador, another Aliyah Bet ship that sank in the Sea of Marmara on 14 December 1940 with the loss of 204, including 66 children. On 15 March 1941, the ship sailed from Istanbul. It was not intercepted by the British, and could have landed the refugees on the coast. However the ship sailed directly into Haifa on 19 March, and the refugees were detained in the Atlit detainee camp, and were not all released until 22 May 1942. Among the refugees aboard Darien II were Abba Berdichev, who joined SOE and was parachuted back into Europe only to be caught and executed by the Germans, and Shulamit, later wife of prime minister Yitzhak Shamir. =Later career and disposal= The Darien II was requisitioned by the British authorities, and under their control sailed to Tobruk in late 1941 following the lifting of the siege. She was then berthed at Alexandria, resuming convoy duties in early 1943 between ports in North Africa, and later Sicily, then shifting operations to ports in mainland Italy in 1944-1945. She operated under the control of the Ministry of War Transport, and was managed by the Wilson Line in 1945, and was purchased from her owners by the Ministry of Transport in 1948 to operate in the Eastern Mediterranean. She was eventually laid up at Port Said in 1950, sold to Italian ship- breakers, and arrived at Spezia for breaking up in 1951.

In 1946 the British colony of the Straits Settlements was dissolved. Penang and Malacca which had formed a part of the Straits Settlements were then grouped with the Unfederated Malay States and the Federated Malay States to form the Malayan Union. In 1948, the Malayan Union was reconstituted as a federation of eleven states known as the Federation of Malaya. Nine of the states of the new Federation of Malaya continued as British Protected States, while two of them, Penang and Malacca remained as British colonies. The Federation of Malaya gained full independence from the UK in August 1957.

Unlike the other Malay states under British protection, however, Johor remained outside of the Federated Malay States (formed in 1895).

In 1924, its Ginza branch became the first department store in Japan where customers could keep their shoes on everywhere inside the store (before that, people had to leave their shoes at the cloakroom). In 1931 a centre for textile art was opened in the Kyoto branch. Between 1931-1939, a remarkable collection of kimono came together with the work of dye craftsmen, antique dealers, and private collectors. Formerly there was a branch at Patterson Street, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong; this was the second Hong Kong branch, the first being when the Japanese Military Government of Hong Kong renamed and transferred Lane Crawford to Matsuzakaya. The branch in Paris had to close when the Japanese economy started cooling in the late 1980s. The store in Yokohama had to close in 2008. There are branches in Ginza and Ueno in Tokyo, Shizuoka City, Toyota, Aichi, and Takatsuki, Osaka. The store at Ginza was closed in 2013 for a large makeover.http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/07/01/business/corporate- business/matsuzakaya-closes-ginza-flagship-for-high-rise- makeover/#.WT6JO5LyiiR It was reopened in 2017 as Ginza Six. The south wing of the main store in Nagoya has in its lobby a large pipe organ. It was made in Canada and has 3231 pipes, of which the longest is 11 meters. On the top floor of the south wing is the Matsuzakaya Art Museum. The latest exhibitions featured ancient Egyptian treasures from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, works by Rubens from the collection of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, the Lady with an Ermine by Leonardo da Vinci from the Czartoryski Museum in Krak√≥w, and exhibit about empress Maria Theresa and Sch√∂nbrunn Palace.

A child prodigy, Cao Chong is best known for his ingenious method of weighing an elephant using the principle of buoyancy. He was considered by his father as a possible successor but died prematurely at the age of 12. Family background Cao Chong was the eldest son of Cao Cao and his concubine Lady Huan (Áí∞Â§´‰∫∫).

Principle of buoyancy On one occasion, the southern warlord Sun Quan sent an elephant as a gift to Cao Cao. Cao Cao wanted to know the animal's weight so he asked his subordinates but no one could think of a method to measure the elephant's weight. Cao Chong said, \\"Place the elephant on a boat and mark the water level. Then replace the elephant with other objects until the boat is submerged to the same level. The weight of the elephant can be found by summing up the weights of all the objects.\\" Cao Cao was delighted and he had Cao Chong's idea implemented.(ÊôÇÂ≠´Ê¨äÊõæËá¥Â∑®Ë±°ÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÊ¨≤Áü•ÂÖ∂Êñ§ÈáçÔºåË®™‰πãÁæ£‰∏ãÔºåÂí∏Ëé´ËÉΩÂá∫ÂÖ∂ÁêÜ„ÄÇÊ≤ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁΩÆË±°Â§ßËàπ‰πã‰∏äÔºåËÄåÂàªÂÖ∂Ê∞¥ÁóïÊâÄËá≥ÔºåÁ®±Áâ©‰ª•Ëºâ‰πãÔºåÂâáÊ†°ÂèØÁü•Áü£„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñÂ§ßÊÅ±ÔºåÂç≥ÊñΩË°åÁÑâ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 20. According to Joseph Needham, although no official treatise in the likes of Archimedes' principle was ever written regarding buoyancy in ancient China, there were observational precedents of it in the Rites of Zhou, compiled and edited in the early Han dynasty (202 BCE‚Äì220 CE). Needham states: Rodents incident In another incident, Cao Cao's saddle was chewed by rodents when it was kept in a store. The storekeepers feared for their lives because the laws were very harsh during those times of war, so they planned to tie themselves up and admit their mistake to Cao Cao in the hope of receiving a lenient punishment. Cao Chong told them, \\"Wait for three days before reporting the incident.\\" He used a knife to cut holes in his clothes, making it seem as though they had been damaged by rats, and then pretended to look upset. When his father asked him, he replied, \\"There is a saying that a person whose clothes have been chewed by rats will encounter ill luck. Now, as this has happened to me, I fear something might happen.\\" Cao Cao said, \\"This is just a superstition. There's nothing to worry about.\\" When the storekeepers reported the saddle incident to Cao Cao three days later, Cao Cao laughed and said, \\"My son's clothes were with him, yet they were still chewed by rats, so it is not surprising that my saddle in the store was also damaged.\\" He did not pursue the matter.(ÊôÇËªçÂúãÂ§ö‰∫ãÔºåÁî®ÂàëÂö¥Èáç„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñÈ¶¨ÈûåÂú®Â∫´ÔºåËÄåÁÇ∫Èº†ÊâÄÈΩßÔºåÂ∫´ÂêèÊáºÂøÖÊ≠ªÔºåË≠∞Ê¨≤Èù¢Á∏õÈ¶ñÁΩ™ÔºåÁå∂Êáº‰∏çÂÖç„ÄÇÊ≤ñË¨ÇÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂæÖ‰∏âÊó•‰∏≠ÔºåÁÑ∂ÂæåËá™Ê≠∏„ÄÇ„ÄçÊ≤ñÊñºÊòØ‰ª•ÂàÄÁ©øÂñÆË°£ÔºåÂ¶ÇÈº†ÈΩßËÄÖÔºåË¨¨ÁÇ∫Â§±ÊÑèÔºåË≤åÊúâÊÑÅËâ≤„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñÂïè‰πãÔºåÊ≤ñÂ∞çÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∏ñ‰øó‰ª•ÁÇ∫Èº†ÈΩßË°£ËÄÖÔºåÂÖ∂‰∏ª‰∏çÂêâ„ÄÇ‰ªäÂñÆË°£Ë¶ãÈΩßÔºåÊòØ‰ª•ÊÜÇÊàö„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊ≠§Â¶ÑË®ÄËÄ≥ÔºåÁÑ°ÊâÄËã¶‰πü„ÄÇ„Äç‰øÑËÄåÂ∫´Âêè‰ª•ÈΩßÈûåËÅûÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÁ¨ëÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÖíË°£Âú®ÂÅ¥ÔºåÂ∞öÈΩßÔºåÊ≥ÅÈûåÁ∏£Êü±‰πéÔºü„Äç‰∏ÄÁÑ°ÊâÄÂïè„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 20.

Biography Arazi was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ to a Jewish family in 1907. He immigrated with his parents to Tel Aviv in the Mandatory Palestine in 1924, studying in the Gymnasia Herzlia. While in Palestine, Arazi joined the Haganah and the Palestine Police Force. As a police officer, he was most notably involved as the investigating officer in the 1933 murder of Chaim Arlosoroff. In 1936, Arazi was sent back to Poland to help smuggle mat√©riel to Palestine. In 1931 he married Rivka Albin, a year later their daughter Ruth was born. She married in 1955 the Supreme Court judge Gabriel Bach. His son Dan was born in 1941. In 1943 he stole 5,000 rifles from the British Police for the Haganah, and had to go into hiding. In 1945, after two years of living in hiding as a wanted man in Palestine, Arazi and his partner Yitzhak Levy travelled to Egypt by train dressed as Royal Engineers sergeants. From there, they travelled through North Africa and into Italy, where they joined the Jewish Brigade of the British Army using falsified names. He was head of the Italy branch of the Mossad LeAliyah Bet, the Haganah agency involved in facilitating illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine, and was involved in the ‚ÄúLa Spezia‚Äù affair. After the independence of Israel in 1948, Arazi became a private businessman and built the Ramat Aviv Hotel. He died of brain cancer in 1959. Shortly before his death, he befriended the artist Chaim Goldberg, also a Polish Jew, who was commissioned to execute several sculptures and a fully functional water fountain for the front of his hotel. The artist established his studio in a former munitions factory that he received from Arazi, that was located behind the hotel. Arazi and the La Spezia affair gave the inspiration to Leon Uris for Ari Ben Canaan in Exodus. Arazi was known as ‚ÄúKing of Ruses‚Äù, changing disguises and identities according to needs.

The main brand was Bass Pale Ale, once the highest- selling beer in the UK. By 1877, Bass had become the largest brewery in the world, with an annual output of one million barrels. Its pale ale was exported throughout the British Empire, and the company's distinctive red triangle became the UK's first registered trade mark. Bass took control of a number of other large breweries in the early 20th century, and in the 1960s merged with Charrington United Breweries to become the largest UK brewing company, Bass Charrington. The brewing operations of the company were bought by Interbrew (now Anheuser-Busch InBev) in 2000, while the retail side (hotel and pub holdings) were renamed Six Continents plc. The UK government's Competition Commission was concerned about the monopoly implications arising from the deal, and instructed Interbrew to dispose of the brewery and certain brands (Carling and Worthington) to Coors (now Molson Coors Brewing Company), but allowed Interbrew to retain the rights to the Bass Pale Ale brand. In 2010, it was widely reported that AB-InBev are attempting to sell the rights to the Bass brand in the UK for around ¬£10 million to ¬£15 million. Draught Bass (4.4% ABV) has been brewed under contract in Burton by Marston's (formerly a relatively minor competitor) for AB-InBev since 2005. Bottled and keg products are brewed at AB-InBev's own brewery in Samlesbury, Lancashire for export, except to the United States and Belgium, where Bass is brewed locally. Bass Ale is a top ten premium canned ale in the UK, with 16,080 hectolitres sold in 2010.PBA Report 2011 History A small wooden barrel from the Bass Brewery, now in the Staffordshire County Museum at Shugborough Hall =1700s= Prior to establishing a brewery, William Bass transported ale for brewer Benjamin Printon. Bass sold this carrier business to the Pickford family, using the funds to establish Bass & Co Brewery in 1777 as one of the first breweries in Burton-upon-Trent. Advertisement for Bass' No.1 Barley Wine, showing the Bass Red Diamond =1800s= Early in the company's history, Bass was exporting bottled beer around the world, serving the Baltic region through the port of Hull. Growing demand led his son Michael Thomas Bass (senior), to build a second brewery in Burton in 1799 in partnership with John Ratcliff. The water produced from local boreholes became popular with brewers, with 30 operating there by the mid-19th century. His son, Michael Thomas Bass, succeeded on his father's death in 1827, renewed the Ratcliff partnership, brought in John Gretton, and created 'Bass, Ratcliff and Gretton'. The opening of a railway through Burton in 1839 redoubled Burton's preeminence as a brewing town. In the mid-1870s, Bass, Ratcliff and Gretton accounted for one third of Burton's output. A strong export business allowed Bass to boast their product was available \\"in every country in the globe\\".A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 9: Burton-upon-Trent (2003)A Bottle of Guinness Please By David Hughes By 1877, Bass was the largest brewery in the world, with an annual output of one million barrels. In the 1880s the brewery received unwanted publicity through the lifestyle of Frederick Gretton, son of John Gretton. Having worked for the company when a young man, he drifted away and developed a stable of racehorses. His 'Sterling' and 'Isonomy' were stars of the Turf. But 'Fred,' as he was known was also a heavy drinker and took a mistress, the teenage Fanny Lucy Radmall. In later life she would become a household name as Lucy, Lady Houston. When Fred died of drink in 1883 he left her ¬£6,000 a year, much to the disgust of his family. Following the death of the second Michael Bass in 1884, his son Michael Arthur Bass, later the 1st Baron Burton, took the reins. Both Michael Thomas Bass and his son Lord Burton were philanthropically inclined, making extensive charitable donations to the towns of Burton and Derby. The annual Bass excursions, laid on by the firm for its employees, were the largest operation of its type in the world by a private company. The brewer became a public limited company in 1888.Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition). New York: St Martin's Press, 1990, Bass' No. 1 Ale was the first beer to be marketed as barley wine, around 1870. = Early 1900s= Early in the 20th century, a declining market closed many Burton breweries, 20 in 1900 falling to eight in 1928. Bass took over Walkers in 1923, and Worthington in 1927. They also acquired Thomas Salt in 1927, which was founded in 1774 by Joseph Clay, for over ¬£1,000,000. =Mid-1900s= Bass was one of the original London Stock Exchange FT 30 companies when the listing was established in 1935. Over the next half-century, Bass maintained its UK dominance through acquiring such brewers as Mitchells & Butlers (1961), Charringtons (1967), Bents-Gartsides (1967), John Joule & Sons (1968), William Stones Ltd (1968), and Grimsby's Hewitt Brothers Ltd (1969), being variously known as Bass, Mitchells and Butlers or Bass Charrington. Draught Bass ale and Worthingon \\"E\\" were merged to become the same product until Bass became preferred as the name of the cask beer and Worthington for keg, although some pubs resisted this distinction. Bass had been reliant on railways to distribute its beer from Burton and owned the country's largest private rail network within the town linking its various premises. From the 1970s it followed the trend to abandon the use of rail freight which had become notoriously unreliable. The switch to road haulage required local transport depots, and in many places small independent breweries were bought and repurposed as such. At this time, along with the other major brewers which now dominated the industry, Bass were moving away from the production of traditional ales in favour of keg beer and particularly Carling lager at Warrington, ignoring opposition from CAMRA. =Late 20th Century= In 1988, Bass acquired the rights to franchise the Holiday Inn name outside of North and South America and in 1989 went on purchase the Holiday Inn hotel chain from Holiday Corporation. Following decades of closures and consolidation, Bass was left by the end of the 20th century with one of the two large remaining breweries in Burton. The brewing operations of the company were bought by Interbrew (now Anheuser-Busch InBev) in 2000, while the retail side (hotel and pub holdings) were renamed Six Continents plc. The UK government's Competition Commission was concerned about the monopoly implications arising from the deal, and instructed Interbrew to dispose of the brewery and certain brands (Carling and Worthington ) to Coors (now Molson Coors Brewing Company), but allowed Interbrew to retain the rights to the Bass Pale Ale brand. Mitchells & Butlers lives on as the assignee of the licensed retail outlet business, which separated from Six Continents. Separation of brewery and beer Iizaka, Fukushima, Japan Bass plc's brewing business was bought by the Belgian brewer Interbrew (now AB-InBev) in June 2000, its hotel and pub holdings absorbed and renamed Six Continents plc. After the Competition Commission raised potential monopoly concerns, Interbrew disposed of Bass Brewers Limited's Carling and Worthington brands to Coors (now Molson Coors Brewing Company), but retained the rights to the Bass beer brand. The beer was produced under licence by Coors, which acquired the Bass brewery facility. Bass Brewers Limited was renamed Coors Brewers Limited. When the licence to brew draught Bass came to an end in 2005, it was taken up by Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries PLC, which started production at Burton's Marston's Brewery. Bottled and keg Bass formerly exported to the US with a higher alcohol content are now produced there domestically by Anheuser-Busch at a Baldwinsville, New York, facility. Brewery museum Sited next to the brewery, the Bass Museum of Brewing (later renamed the Coors Visitor Centre & The Museum of Brewing), was Burton-upon-Trent's largest tourist attraction until closed by Coors in June 2008. A steering group was established to investigate re-opening, and the museum was relaunched in May 2010 as the National Brewery Centre. Branding Bottles of Bass on the bar in Manet's 1882 A Bar at the Folies-Berg√®re Bass was a pioneer in international brand marketing. \\"Many years before 1855\\" Bass applied a red triangle to casks of its Pale Ale. After 1855 the triangles were red, white or blue depending on which of three breweries it came from, but all bottles of Pale Ale had the red triangle from that date. The blue triangle was briefly revived after World War II for Pale Ale that wasn't bottle conditioned. The Bass Red Triangle was the first trade mark to be registered under the UK's Trade Marks Registration Act 1875. The Act came into effect on 1 January 1876 and legend has it that a Bass employee queued overnight outside the registrar's office on New Year's Eve in order to be the first in line to register a trade mark the next morning. As a result, Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton Limited received the first two registrations, the Bass Red Triangle for their pale ale and the Bass Red Diamond next for their strong ale. The trade marks are now owned by Brandbrew SA, an InBev subsidiary based in Luxembourg. In June 2013 InBev renamed Bass Pale Ale as Bass Trademark No.1. Bottles of Bass with the Red Triangle logo have occasionally appeared in art and literature, including √âdouard Manet's 1882 painting A Bar at the Folies-Berg√®reKenneth Bendiner, and in over 40 paintings by Picasso, mostly at the height of his Cubist period around 1914. In the \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" episode of James Joyce's Ulysses, Bloom observes the Bass logo.\\"During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its scarlet appearance.\\" ‚Äî Episode XIV, Ulysses, James Joyce (1922). =Sponsorship= Derby County sponsored by Bass Crewe Alexandra sponsored by Bass * Bass sponsored Derby County Football Club from 1984 to 1986. * Bass sponsored Crewe Alexandra Football Club from 1986 to 1989. * Bass sponsored Blackpool Football Club from 1988 to 1990. * Bass was the main sponsor of Bristol Rugby for 2006‚Äì07. * Bass was a major sponsor of Pontypridd RFC during the 2009‚Äì2011 seasons.

Estefan has won 19 Grammy Awards. He first came to prominence as a member of the Miami Sound Machine. He is the husband of singer Gloria Estefan, father of son Nayib Estefan and daughter Emily Estefan, and the uncle of Spanish-language television personality Lili Estefan. Background Emilio Estefan G√≥mez was born in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba to Emilio Estefan, Sr. (c. 1920‚Äì2003) and Carmen Maria G√≥mez (1921‚Äì2006). Carmen's parents Antonio G√≥mez and Carmen Vasquez were Spanish immigrants who met while the latter was working for the Bacardi family. Cuban-born Emilio Sr. was the second-to last child in his family (which consisted of eleven siblings), and he had Lebanese ancestry from his paternal side‚Äîmany of whom were textile traders that traveled throughout Cuba and the Caribbean. Emilio Sr. was raised by his widowed mother Julia, as his father had died when he was still a child. In 1967, at the age of fourteen, Estefan and his father Emilio Sr. fled Cuba for Spain to escape the Castro regime. The Estefan family planned to reunite in the United States and, as a result, Carmen chose to remain behind because she did not want to abandon her parents. In addition, Estefan's older brother Jos√© (b. 1945) was drafted in the military and could not leave Cuba until 1980. For about a year, Estefan and his father lived an impoverished life in Spain before relocating permanently in Miami, Florida. Although circumstances were far better in Miami, Estefan and Emilio Sr. still struggled as they lived in a cramped house with Estefan's aunt and 8 cousins. Estefan did not reunite with his mother until 1971 when she was finally able to immigrate to the United States. It was during his formative years that Estefan cultivated his musical sensibilities, as he had often used his accordion-playing skills to earn enough tips to support his father and family. Professional career = Early music = In 1975, Gloria and her cousin Mercedes \\"Merci\\" Navarro (1957‚Äì2007) met Estefan while performing at a church ensemble rehearsal. Estefan, who had formed the band the Miami Latin Boys earlier that year, learned about Gloria through a mutual acquaintance. While the Miami Latin Boys were performing at a Cuban wedding at Hotel Dupont, Gloria and Merci (who were wedding guests) performed two Cuban standards impromptu. They impressed the Miami Latin Boys so much that they were invited to join the band permanently with the band's name changing to Miami Sound Machine. Gloria, who was attending the University of Miami at the time, only agreed to perform during the weekends so that her studies would not be interrupted. Eventually, Miami Sound Machine would perform with Gloria Estefan (n√©e Fajardo) as the lead singer and headliner. = Producer = As a producer, Estefan has shaped the careers of several music superstars. He has also produced various events for both general market and Hispanic market television. These events include the Latin Grammys, Hispanic Heritage Awards, Nuestra Navidad, and some high- profile productions on HBO and Showtime. He has also produced many musical events at the White House. In 2008, Estefan produced and directed his first full-length documentary 90 Millas to showcase the history and pioneers of Cuban music. Estefan gathered dozens of Latino entertainers in 2010 to record Michael Jackson's \\"We Are The World\\" in Spanish. The Spanish language version, already written by Estefan and approved by Quincy Jones, became \\"Somos El Mundo\\". It premiered during El Show de Cristina on March 1, 2010 and the funds went to the Haiti relief. Also, in 2010, Estefan released his book The Rhythm of Success ‚Äì How an Immigrant Produced his own American Dream. The following year, Estefan presented the book The Exile Experience: A Journey to Freedom in collaboration with writer Carlos Pintado and journalist Carlos Alberto Montaner, which included the personal testimonials from different generations of exiles. The Exile Experience: Journey to Freedom is published in three separate editions ‚Äì each tailor-made for those who arrived through Operation Pedro Pan, the Freedom Flights and the Mariel boatlift. Each edition features the names of every Cuban who arrived via one of those three exoduses, and there has been an accumulation of 400,000 and more names amongst the three editions published. He partnered with the Nederlander Group in 2013 to produce the Broadway musical extravaganza, On Your Feet! The musical is based on the life and musical legacy of the Estefans and Fajardos. On Your Feet! premiered on Broadway in October 2015. Estefan also became an AARP Life Reimagined ambassador in 2013. In his new role, Emilio shares his expertise on a variety of subjects, including his passion for living, mentoring, entrepreneurship, philanthropy, and much more. In February 2014, Estefan directed and produced the documentary film An Unbreakable Bond about the real-life story of father- son duo Marc and Nick Buoniconti's undying commitment towards finding a cure for paralysis. The film premiered at National & International film festivals.Gloria & Emilio Estefan at the 2014 Miami International Film Festival premiere of An Unbreakable Bond In early 2014, in a decision unanimously approved by the County Commission, Estefan was appointed Miami- Dade Special Ambassador by Miami-Dade County Commissioner Jean Monestime. In his unpaid four-year non-partisan role, Emilio was set to represent the Miami- Dade community at an international level to encourage and promote the diversity of business and trade. During the same year, Estefan and Botr√°n Rum created a strategic marketing alliance including a personal endorsement by Estefan. Through his role, Estefan will help promote the brand throughout the U.S., leading a multi-channel marketing campaign with the mantra \\"The Night Begins with Botran.\\" Estefan sits as the second vice-chair to the commission for the National Museum of the American Latino, a bi-partisan commission charged with exploring the possibility of creating a National Latino Museum in Washington D.C. =Other business ventures= Ocean Drive, in Miami Beach, Florida. Gloria and Emilio Estefan own a number of business establishments, including several Cuban-themed restaurants (Bongos Cuban Caf√©; Larios on the Beach). The restaurants are located in Miami Beach, downtown Miami (part of the American Airlines Arena), at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, Walt Disney World's Disney Springs in Orlando, Florida, and in Miami International Airport. They also own two hotels: Costa d'Este in Vero Beach which opened in 2008, and The Cardozo in Miami Beach. In June 2009, Estefan and his wife became the first Hispanics to buy a minor ownership stake in an NFL team, the Miami Dolphins.\\"Dolphins announce Estefans' stake in team\\", Sports Illustrated (via AP Miami), June 25, 2009\\"Emilio and Gloria Estefan give Miami Dolphins celebrity appeal\\", The Miami Herald, June 26, 2009 According to articles published in People en Espa√±ol and AARP Magazine, the Estefans' estimated net worth as of 2011 was approximately $700 million. Awards In 1994, Estefan was awarded the El Premio Billboard award for his work in the Latin music industry. In the same year, he was given the Excellence Award at the 1994 Lo Nuestro Awards. At the Latin Grammy Awards of 2000, Estefan received the award for Producer of the Year for his work on the albums Ciego de Amor by Charlie Zaa, El Amor de Mi Tierra by Carlos Vives and the song \\"Da la Vuelta\\" by Marc Anthony and was recognized as Person of the Year by the Latin Recording Academy. In 2002, he was appointed to the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities by President George W. Bush. In 2005, Estefan received the BMI \\"Songwriter of the Year\\" award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Estefan has received honorary doctoral degrees from Barry University, the University of Miami, Florida International University and the Berklee College of Music. He also received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award by the Songwriters' Hall of Fame and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2009. Estefan was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014. In November 2015, President Barack Obama awarded Estefan and his wife Gloria with the nation's highest civilian honor‚Äîthe Presidential Medal of Freedom. They were also awarded Lo Nuestro Excellence Award in 2018. Personal life Estefan became romantically involved with the Miami Sound Machine's lead singer Gloria Fajardo in 1976. They married on September 2, 1978 and have a son, Nayib (born September 2, 1980), and a daughter, Emily (born December 5, 1994). The family lives on Star Island. Emily is a recording artist. Nayib is an aspiring filmmaker and owner of the Nite Owl Theater in Miami. On June 5, 2010, Nayib married Lara Diamante Coppola in the backyard of his parents' house. On June 21, 2012, the first Estefan grandchild was born: grandson Sasha Argento Coppola Estefan. Gloria Estefan has said that ‚ÄúSasha Argento,‚Äù which means ‚Äúbenefactor of mankind‚Äù in Arabic, was a possible name that she and Emilio thought about naming their son Nayib.

Synopsis The program featured Don Adams and Rupert Crosse as bumbling detectives, John Doucette their exasperated commanding officer. Dick Van Patten played the sycophantic desk sergeant. Robert Karvelas had a recurring role as Freddie, who compulsively confessed to crimes he did not commit. The pilot featured guest appearances by Joey Forman, Art Metrano, and Yvonne Craig. Production notes Unlike many television programs of its day, The Partners eschewed a traditional opening title sequence. The opening credits were merely interspersed during the first few minutes, akin to the technique that has become quite commonplace today. The theme music, which accompanied the closing credits and occasionally popped up during the program itself, was composed by Lalo Schifrin, best known for the theme to Mission: Impossible. Characters Unlike many other sitcoms of the 1960s and 70s, there is no family seen in the show. There are not many characters altogether. Detective Lennie Crooke: (Don Adams) Det. Lennie Crooke is a slightly inept police detective, a bit similar to Adams' previous character on Get Smart, Maxwell Smart. Details on his life and family are very sparse. He has mentioned on one or two occasions that he has acrophobia, the fear of heights, and he was never in Korea, according to his statement in the pilot episode, Here Come The Fuzz. He has a likelihood to forget things that no other sane detective would forget, including his pants. He is not married and we do see inside his apartment on one or two occasions. It appears to be very neat with every personal item in its own place. He isn't too intelligent and is prone to get everyone in a room confused in his attempts to carry on an intelligent conversation. He tends to dislike the desk sergeant Higgenbottem, who in turn doesn't seem to like Lennie. The two will argue about anything, such as how \\"It's not true that George let me escape but it is true that I locked George in the closet, so when I said it was true, I was referring to how it wasn't true that that was true\\" or how \\"They stole 13 cars in the last two weeks and that makes 14 if you count our car, but then they stole our other car which would make it 15 but then the car we found in the driveway takes it back to down to 14.\\" To which Higgenbottem will reply, \\"No, I'm counting both your cars and that car because whether you found it or not it was originally stolen and I'm also counting the Rolls Royce so that makes 16.\\" And then Lennie will continue to argue that he had forgotten the Rolls Royce and that made it 15 again, and so they would go on until Captain Andrews put a stop to it. The two seem to rather enjoy these comical arguments, in fact. Lennie was in every episode. Detective George Robinson: (Rupert Crosse) George is Lennie's best friend, longtime partner, and sarcastic steadying force. He was in every episode. He is a tall black man, prone to roll his eyes and shake his head at Lenny and his antics, and even less is known about him. He was in Korea, and while he has no fear or heights, he often does seem to have a fear of Lennie's driving. He notices things that go right over his partner's head, and he is the one that keeps Lennie, and sometimes Higgenbottem, from making complete fools of themselves. He doesn't seem to have a very large affinity for Higgenbottem, in fact in the pilot episode when Higgenbottom was reading the report on what the two partners had messed up, and was continually adding in pieces to the sentence that were charging the two with worse crimes, George offered to 'make a suggestion that might help the situation.' -- \\"Ask Higgenbottem to leave the room.\\" Captain Aaron William Andrews: (John Doucette) Captain Andrews is a sarcastic police captain, the boss of Lennie and George, who plays a role similar to that of the one Ed Platt played in Get Smart, as The Chief of CONTROL. He really does like Lennie and George in spite of his many sarcastic statements. A good example of his sarcasm: Higgenbottem, whom he is friends with, bursts into the room exclaiming that they have a \\"code 64,\\" Lennie tells him to take it to the animal shelter because that's a lost dog. \\"No, that's a code 65.\\" Higgenbottem said. \\"Oh, of course,\\" Lennie answered, \\"I was confusing it with a code 63--\\" \\"Which is someone being assaulted,\\" corrected Higginbottem, as Captain Andrews exclaimed, looking pointedly at Lenny, \\"And we may have one in this room at any moment!\\" Sgt. Nelson Higgenbottem.: (Dick Van Patten) The sycophantic desk Sergeant Higgenbottom is a small man who loves any chance to grate on Lennie's nerves and enjoys arguing with Lennie as well, only tolerates George but still looks for chances to annoy him too, and who does whatever Captain Andrews asks, and generally sides with him. Lennie has a habit of starting a sentence off with \\"Well, at least there's one good thing that came out of this...\\" after he's done something stupid. Higgenbottem always answers the same way, saying eagerly, \\"You're leaving the force?\\" Freddie Butler: Don Adams' real life cousin, Robert Karvelas, who played Agent Larabee on Get Smart, played Freddie Butler, who was in seven episodes. He is always chronically confessing to other people's crimes, and consistently manages to drive Lennie, George, and Higgenbottem and Captain Andrews crazy. When he appears, Lennie usually exclaims, \\"Just what I can't stand right now, Freddie Butler!\\" Reception NBC had exceptionally high hopes for the series after it performed well with test audiences. However, it failed to find a large enough audience because it aired Saturday nights at 8:00pm‚Äîright up against the highest-rated show on television, CBS's All in the Family. (Originally, CBS had scheduled My Three Sons against The Partners, but substituted All in the Family at the last minute.) After their January 8, 1972, broadcasts, NBC removed both The Partners and fellow freshman sitcom The Good Life from its schedule. (The move worked out for the network, as they were replaced with the medical drama Emergency!, which was a hit and ran six seasons.) Seventeen episodes of the show had aired by January; three more would be \\"burned off\\" in the summer of 1972. The show ranked 66th out of 78 shows that season with an average 12.5 rating.http://www.thetvratingsguide.com/2020/02/written-questioning-networks- changing.html The Partners has never been officially released on home video, but several websites offer low-quality bootleg DVDs of the series.

Teams which ranked in the top half of the league standings table (e.g. the top five teams in a ten-team league) were said to have finished in the \\"first division\\", while teams in the bottom half of the standings were said to be in the \\"second division\\". In the major leagues before 1969, players on teams finishing in the first division received monetary shares from the Players' Pool, which was funded by gate receipts from that year's World Series; specifically, prior to the aforementioned expansion, the team winning the World Series received 42% of this money, the team losing the World Series got 28%, with the second-, third- and fourth-place teams in each league being awarded 7¬Ω%, 5% and 2¬Ω% respectively. Concomitant with the expansion, 1% was taken from both of the World Series teams and given to each of the teams finishing in fifth place. The New York Yankees finished in the first division for a record 39 consecutive years, from 1926 through 1964, all inclusive; by contrast, the Chicago Cubs once finished in the second division for 20 years in a row -- between 1947 and 1966. Major League Baseball meaning since 1969 realignment With the realignment of both leagues into two geographically based divisions in 1969, the terms \\"first division\\" and \\"second division\\" quickly fell into disuse (largely because the word \\"division\\" had acquired a completely different meaning), although teams finishing in the top half of the standings -- now the first three teams in each of the new divisions -- continued to share in the Players' Pool. The distribution of the Players' Pool money was also changed at this time, with the World Series winner henceforth getting 36% of the pool, its loser 27%, the losers of the League Championship Series 12¬Ω% each, the second-place teams in the divisions 2 3/8% each, and the third-place teams 5/8% each. In 1991 these shares were revised to 36%, 24%, 12%, 3% and 1% respectively, and when both major leagues realigned again in 1995 (each league now consisting of three divisions, the winners thereof plus one wild card team in each league reaching the postseason), the 3% shares went to teams losing in the Division Series and the 1% shares went to the teams that finished second in their division but did not earn a wild card.

History The mill was built in 1821 because the construction of the Kennet and Avon Canal had included the canalisation of the River Bedwyn which had previously powered several water mills in the area. The windmill was in use for a century, continuing into the 1920s, but fell into disuse, probably as the result of competition from large steam roller mills. In the 1960s it was added to the list of buildings of architectural or historical merit as Grade II*. In 1971 it was bought by Wiltshire County Council and leased to the Wiltshire Historic Buildings Trust, which early in 1972 began to restore it to working condition.Anna Stowe, 'A brief history of Wilton Windmill' in Wiltshire Life magazine dated May 2011 By the end of the summer of 1976 the windmill was once again making flour. It is now owned by Wiltshire Council and managed by the Wilton Windmill Society, formed in 1976 and operated entirely by volunteers. In the 1980s the mill was in financial difficulties, which led to the Society forming a cricket XI, the Wilton Millers' Cricket Team, to raise funds by playing sponsored matches, and in 2011 this was still in existence, although no longer needed for fundraising. Flour, made from locally grown wheat, is still produced at the mill and can be bought on site and in local shops. Sails As when it was first constructed, the mill has a fantail, which causes the cap supporting the sails to turn to make best use of the available wind. Of the four sails, two are of canvas and two are more complicated \\"patent sails\\", each consisting of twenty-two sections which can be angled.

Bangles are traditionally rigid bracelets, originating from the Indian subcontinent, which are usually made of metal, wood, glass or plastic. They are traditional ornaments worn mostly by women from the Indian subcontinent. It is common to see a new bride wearing glass bangles at her wedding, they symbolize auspiciousness and sanctity of marriage. Bangles are a sign of a women's 'suhaag'.

A special type of bangle is worn by women and girls, especially in the Bengal area, commonly known as a \\"Bengali bangle\\", which is used as a substitute for a costly gold bangle, and is produced by fixing a thin gold strip (weighing between 1‚Äì3 g) is thermo-mechanically fused onto a bronze bangle, followed by manual crafting on that fused gold strip. Bangles are part of traditional Indian jewellery. They are sometimes worn in pairs by women, one or more on each arm. It is also common for women to wear a single bangle or several bangles on just one wrist. Most Indian women prefer wearing either gold or glass bangles or a combination of both. Inexpensive bangles made from plastic are slowly replacing those made by glass, but the ones made of glass are still preferred at traditional occasions such as marriages and on festivals. Bangles are the signs for traditional women and girls. Bangles play a very important role in various India dance forms. Some of dance forms include bangles striking to each other a tone of the music. The designs range from simple to intricate handmade designs, often studded with precious and semi-precious stones such as diamonds, gems and pearls. Sets of expensive bangles made of gold and silver make a jingling sound. The imitation jewellery tends to make a tinny sound when jingled. Types of bangles There are two basic types of bangles: a solid cylinder type; and a split, cylindrical spring opening/closing type. The primary distinguishing factor between these is the material used to make the bangles. This may vary from anything from glass to jade to metal to lac and even rubber or plastic. Multicolor glass bangles in Gangotri One factor that adds to the price of the bangles is the artifacts or the work done further on the metal. This includes embroidery or small glass pieces or paintings or even small hangings that are attached to the bangles. The rareness of a color and its unique value also increase the value. Bangles made from lac are one of the oldest types and among the most brittle. Lac is a resinous material, secreted by insects, which is collected and molded in hot kilns to make these bangles. Among the recent kinds are rubber bangles, worn more like a wristband by youngsters, and plastic ones which add a trendy look. Normally, a bangle worn by people around the world is simply an inflexible piece of jewelry worn around the wrist. However, in many cultures, especially those from Indian cultures and the broader Indian subcontinent, bangles have evolved into various types in which different ones are used on different occasions. Following are some popular designs of bangles in India:- # Jadau Bangles (Also known Kundan). # Meenakari Bangles. # Lac or Lakhs Bangles. Bangles, in India, usually used by married women or girl.

Levertin was a dominant voice of the Swedish cultural scene from 1897, when he started writing influential high-profile essays and reviews in the daily paper Svenska Dagbladet. From 1899 until his early death in 1906 he also occupied the first Chair of literary history at the University of Stockholm, in which role he published extensive studies, particularly in Swedish 18th century literature. Overview In his own short story collections in the 1880s, Levertin first aligned himself with the Naturalist school of fiction of which August Strindberg was the most prominent member. In 1888, however, the previously unheard Swedish romantic poetic voice of Verner von Heidenstam's Vallfart och vandrings√•r changed Levertin's stylistic ideals. Levertin and Heidenstam published together a pamphlet attacking the Naturalist style in 1890, and even though Levertin was never to abandon his scientific and materialist view of history (something that sets him off from other poets of his generation), his literary energies were thenceforth channelled into poetry of a romantic, exotic and historical character. Together with Heidenstam's work, Levertin's first collection of poetry, Legender och visor (Legends and Songs) (1891), sparked an 1890s Swedish fashion for historical, particularly \\"medieval\\", literature. Unlike Heidenstam's and much other Swedish poetry of the 1890s, Legender och visor is free from Swedish nationalism, drawing on many European as well as Middle Eastern sources. This volume remains highly regarded today, though no longer widely read. Poems from it, including the ballad \\"Flores och Blanzeflor\\", remained set texts in Swedish schools into the 1970s.

The cuisine is heavily influenced by the rich dark soil (chornozem) from which its ingredients come and often involves many components. The national dish of Ukraine that undeniably originates from the country is borsch. However, varenyky and holubtsi are also considered national favourites of the Ukrainian people and are a common meal in traditional Ukrainian restaurants. Often referred to as the ‚Äúbreadbasket of Europe‚Äù the Ukrainian cuisine emphasizes the importance of wheat and grain to the Ukrainian people and its often tumultuous history with it. The majority of Ukrainian dishes descend from ancient peasant dishes based on plentiful grain resources such as rye as well as staple vegetables such as potato, cabbages, mushrooms and beetroots. Ukrainian dishes incorporate both traditional Slavic techniques as well as other European techniques, a by product of years of foreign jurisdiction and influence. The Ukrainian cuisine incorporates a variety of different food branches (carbohydrates, fats, protein, fruits and vegetables) due to the large size of the country and the plentiful edible resources. Traditional Ukrainian dishes often experience a complex heating process - \\"at first they are fried or boiled, and then stewed or baked.

Marsman Hendrik Marsman (30 September 1899, in Zeist ‚Äì 21 June 1940, in Gulf of Biscay) was a Dutch poet and writer. He died while escaping to Great Britain, when the ship he was sailing on, the ', either suffered a fatal engine-room explosion, or was torpedoed by a German submarine which mistook Berenice for another vessel. Biography Autograph of the poem Invocatio Marsman studied law and practised in Utrecht, but after 1933 he travelled in Europe and devoted himself to literature. Under the influence of the German Expressionists, Marsman made his literary debut about 1920 with rhythmic free verse, which attracted notice for its aggressive independence. In the biography of Hendrik Marsman on the website of the Charley Toorop is mentioned as one of the women who had a relationship with Marsman before he married in 1929 his wife Rien Barendregt. The collection Verzen (1923; ‚ÄúVerses‚Äù) expresses an antihumanist, anti-intellectual rebelliousness, which the poet called ‚Äúvitalism.‚Äù As editor of the periodical De Vrije bladen (‚ÄúThe Free Press‚Äù), he became in 1925 the foremost critic of the younger generation. His next collection of verse appeared in 1927 with the English title Paradise Regained and was greeted as a major artistic achievement. Another cycle, Porta Nigra, dominated by the idea of death, appeared in 1934. His last book of verse, Tempel en kruis (1940; ‚ÄúTemple and Cross‚Äù), an autobiographical account of the poet's development, reaffirms humanistic ideals. After obtaining a Portuguese visa in Bordeaux, France, on June 18, 1940 from the Consul-General Aristides de Sousa Mendes, Marsman boarded a ship bound for England. Tragically, he drowned three days later when the ship sunk after an explosion in the English Channel. His wife survived as the only passenger. His poetry is vitalistic and expressionistic, and (fear of) death, as a metaphor for defeat in life, is a recurring theme. His \\"Herinnering aan Holland\\" (Remembrance of Holland): \\"Denkend aan Holland zie ik breede rivieren traag door oneindig laagland gaan,\\" Thinking about Holland, I see broad rivers slowly moving through endless lowlands. In 2000, the Dutch people chose this as the \\"Dutch Poem of the Century.\\"  Awards  *1927 - Prijs van Amsterdam (Amsterdam Award) for Paradise regained *1936 - Lucy B. en C.W. van der Hoogt Award for Porta Nigra  Death  Hendrik Marsman died on board the ship S.S. Berenice that sunk in the Bay of Biscay in the early morning of 21 June 1940. The ship had set sailing from Bordeaux and sank in the North Sea. Different accounts exist on what might have sunk the S.S. Berenice. The narrative according to the National Library of the Netherlands, that keeps an archive on Hendrik Marsman, goes like this: In the early morning of 21 June 1940 \\"S.S. Berenice\\", sailing from Bordeaux, sank in the North Sea due to an explosion in the engine-room and not, as the persistent rumour goes, as the result of a well- aimed German torpedo. On a website dedicated to German submarines (U-boats) the sinking of the \\"S.S. Berenice\\" by the German submarine U-65 is detailed to the minute, although with some leeway for controversy: the U-boat might have accidentally; due to fog; attacked the \\"S.S. Berenice\\" confusing it with another ship: the \\"Champlain\\". \\"According to the [log] of U-65, they sighted a big steamer, identified as Champlain (28.124 grt), at 5.45 hours, which was shadowed until 7.35 hours, when the U-boat lost contact in fog. A short time later the ship was sighted again and attacked with a spread of three torpedoes at 8.17 hours. Allied sources reports that the Champlain went to the bottom after being damaged by an air laid magnetic mine off La Pallice at 09.30 hours on 17 June. In knowledge of these sources, the torpedo report of U-65 claims the Champlain as his own success, but date, time and position are well fitting with the loss of the Berenice.\\" After presenting by email a librarian of the Royal Dutch Library with the rather confusing stories regarding the \\"S.S. Berenice\\" this reply was received: \\"According to the biography of the poet Marsman by Jaap Goedegebuure [...] it took Dutch historians 45 years to establish that the Berenice was not hit by a torpedo from the U65. An attack one day later was confused with the explosion on the Berenice. Source for the biography on this matter was a 1986 history of Dutch merchant shipping by historian Karel Bezemer (Geschiedenis van de Nederlandse koopvaardij in de Tweede Wereldoorlog). In Holland the U-boat-attack on the Berenice is considered to be a persistent myth, stimulated by his widow and admirers of the poet who wanted his death to be more heroic.\\"Email reply on the matter received on May 30, 2014 by Arno Kuipers - Collectiespecialist Nederlandse taal- en letterkunde - Afdeling Collecties, of the Royal Dutch Library. The only surviving passenger was Marsman's wife Rien Barendregt. She was saved because at the time of the explosion she was on deck serving breakfast while wearing a life jacket and the explosion threw her overboard. She told captain Groenhof of the boat (\\"Nettie\\") that picked her and the few survivors up about her husband [that] \\"He could no longer hold on\\". The article in the Dutch newspaper Trouw that covers the history of the boat \\"Nettie\\" goes under the suggestive title \\"Marsman kon niet meer op ms 'Nettie' wachten\\" which translates as \\"Marsman could no longer wait for the ship 'Nettie'\\". According to the same article (in Dutch) no manuscript or body was recovered after the explosion. In poems including \\"Vrees\\" ('Fear'), describing \\"the moment that the bullet won't miss\\", \\"Zinkend ship\\" ('Sinking ship'), \\"De Overtocht\\" (The Passage [by boat]) some see signs of Henrik Marsman predicting his own moment of dying and his fear \\"dat de dood het einde niet is\\" ('that dead is not the end'). In \\"Verzet\\" ('Resistance') Marsman pictures the last moments of a dying man using his last grain of energy to fight off a priest holding a crucifix in front of him with the kick and the scream \\"Mijn zonden gaan mee in Mijn graf\\" ('My sins go with me in My grave'). An on-line published biography (in Dutch) mentions six (6) poems that seem to predict the way Marsman died. Only a verse of the poem \\"Maannacht\\" ('Moon Night') is used there as illustration.

It connects the municipalities of Jiaxing and Ningbo in Zhejiang province. Construction of the bridge was completed on June 14, 2007, and an opening ceremony was held on June 26, 2007. The bridge was opened to public May 1, 2008, after a considerable period of testing and evaluation. The bridge shortened the highway travel distance between Ningbo and Shanghai from to and reduced travel time from 4 to 2 hours. At in length, Hangzhou Bay Bridge was among the ten longest trans-oceanic bridges. History The bridge across the Hangzhou Bay was the subject of various feasibility studies for over a decade before the final plans were approved in 2003. An earlier plan placed the bridge further east, closer to the mouth of the bay, which provided an even shorter travel distance between Ningbo and Shanghai. Under this plan, the bridge would begin in the north from Jinshan, a suburb of Shanghai. The government of Shanghai rejected the plan and focused on building the -long Donghai Bridge from Shanghai to its off-shore port at Yangshan in the mouth of the bay. The Shanghai government sought to feature Yangshan as the chief port on China's east coast and refused to allow a cross-bay bridge to be built on its territory, which would improve access to the Port of Ningbo at Beilun. The Zhejiang Provincial Government was forced to build the bridge further to the west on entirely Zhejiang territory. The Hangzhou Bay Bridge connects Cixi, a local-level city that is part of Ningbo Municipality, with Haiyan, a county in Jiaxing Municipality. The Hangzhou Bay Bridge has significantly shortened driving distance between Ningbo and the Yangtze River Delta region and improved the competitiveness of the Beilun Port. Structural description Hangzhou Bay Bridge (section) The Hangzhou Bay Bridge is of the cable stayed bridge form. This form was chosen for this project because of the strength of the cable stayed bridge in adverse conditions. The bridge was constructed in the Qiantang River and Yangtze River Deltas and Hangzhou Bay, which all experience some of the highest tidal bore forces on the planet. The location of the bridge is also prone to earthquakes, as well as extremely high winds during typhoon season. The bridge form and construction material selections were based on strength against all the different forces the bridge would face. Many bridges use concrete piles to support the deck but the Hangzhou Bay Bridge took a different approach and used steel piles. This choice was made based on the fact that the steel piles would be much stronger against corrosion from the extremely high tidal forces in the bay. Using the steel piles instead of the concrete piles also made the bridge far more constructible especially in the extremely difficult working conditions that they would be facing. It is not strange to see waves in the bay reaching 25 feet tall. In these conditions it would be almost impossible to construct the bridge without the use of some new construction technology and vehicles. During the construction of the bridge two massive cranes were used, one being 2,200 tons and the other being 3,000 tons. These heavy duty cranes were used to transport massive girders from the shore to the part of the bridge where they would then lift it and put it into place. The steel piles used were also transported using these cranes. The load paths in this structure are somewhat easy to follow. The gravity load on the bridge as well as the rest of the loading on the deck such as cars are the easiest to follow which is further explained in the qualification as structural art section. The loads on the bridge due to the extreme tides are somewhat difficult to read, but they are clearly accounted for. The steel piles are the structural supports that resist the tidal loads. The piles are driven deep into the sea bed to reduce the movement on them. Having a small moment or force causing bending in the piles keeps the bridge upright. The steel is extremely strong against corrosion and are therefore the best material that could have been used in the piles. When looking at the loading due to wind loads on the bridge the main portion that is important to analyze is the main spans. Because the two main spans are relative short the wind loading is insignificant. The wind loads however would be accounted for due to the outward bend of the towers that support the tension cables. This theory of widening the bottom of towers was first used by Gustav Eiffel when constructing the Eiffel Tower. The bent shape is very good at transferring the wind load to the base supports of the structure. Challenges Because of the many difficulties facing such a tremendous build, almost 600 experts spent nearly a decade designing the bridge. Even after nearly a decade of design, studies, and planning, many different challenges were encountered, the first being the challenge of offshore construction. As a solution, several parts of the bridge had to be completed on land and then transported to the area for which they were built. Some components that were constructed using this process were piers, box girders (bridge panels), and even the bridge foundations. Another construction challenge involved the weather in the region. Wang Yong, chief director of the Hangzhou Bay Trans-Oceanic Bridge Construction Command Post, described the bridge as being built \\"in the world's most complicated sea environment, with one of the three biggest tides on Earth, the effect of typhoons and the difficult content of the sea soil.\\" Erosion of materials and cracking and bubbling of any concrete components became a large problem. To combat bubbling and eventual holes, engineers used a cloth-covered template over the concrete. This would improve the color and density of the pieces, making them both more aesthetically pleasing and sturdier. To reduce cracking, engineers used low- strength early-stretching technology when constructing box girders. This technology involves casting (molding) the girder, or bridge panel, letting it harden for no more than three days, and then squeezing it before it reaches its full density. This gives the girder more room to stretch after the bridge is constructed, preventing cracks in the concrete over time. The third major challenge faced by designers and engineers was an area of toxic methane gas that was discovered roughly 50 meters underground below the location of the bridge. No drilling could be completed before the gas pressure was alleviated. To do this, steel pipes measuring 60 cm in diameter were inserted into the ground, slowly releasing the methane six months prior to drilling. Service Center Service center with lookout tower at midpoint of Hangzhou Bay Bridge A service centre called Land between the Sea and the Sky (Chinese: Êµ∑Â§©‰∏ÄÊ¥≤, Pinyin: h«éi-tiƒÅn yƒ´-zh≈çu) is built in the middle of the bridge. This centre consists of shopping/exhibition/parking/restaurant facilities, a hotel and a lookout tower which serves as a tourist attraction from where to enjoy a bird's eye view of the bridge and the ocean. The service centre is built on an island, which is a platform resting on piers to avoid obstructing the sea current in the bay. The service centre was slightly damaged in a fire on March 23, 2010, but opened to tourists on December 19, 2010.

Collins Crime Club ‚Äì A checklist of First Editions. Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (p. 15) and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in October of the same year.American Tribute to Agatha Christie The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. The novel features Christie's detective, Hercule Poirot, who takes a holiday in Devon. During his stay, he notices a young woman who is flirtatious and attractive, but not well liked by a number of guests. When she is murdered during his stay, he finds himself drawn into investigating the circumstances surrounding the murder. Plot summary Hercule Poirot takes a quiet holiday at a secluded hotel in Devon. He finds that the other hotel guests include: Arlena Marshall, her husband Kenneth, and her step-daughter Linda; Horace Blatt; Major Barry, a retired officer; Rosamund Darnley, a former sweetheart of Kenneth; Patrick Redfern, and his wife Christine, a former teacher; Carrie Gardener, and her husband Odell; Reverend Stephen Lane; and Miss Emily Brewster, an athletic spinster. During the initial part of his stay, Poirot notes that Arlena is a flirtatious woman, who flirts with Patrick much to the fury of his wife, and that her step-daughter hates her. One morning, Arlena heads out for a secret rendezvous at Pixy Cove. By midday, she is found dead by Patrick and Brewster while they are rowing. An examination by the local police surgeon reveals she had been strangled by a man. Both Poirot and the investigating officer, Inspector Colgate, interview the possible suspects about their movements during the morning ‚Äì Kenneth had been typing letters; the Gardeners had been with Poirot all morning; Rosamund had been reading above Pixy Cove; Blatt had gone sailing; Linda and Christine went to Gull Cove and didn't return until before midday; and both Lane and Major Barry were absent from the island. At noon, Christine, Rosamund, Kenneth and Odell all met to play tennis. Poirot learns that Brewster was nearly hit by a bottle during the morning, thrown from one of the guest rooms, while the hotel chambermaid recalls hearing someone running a bath at noon. At a cave within Pixy Cove, Poirot notes smelling perfume that Arlena used within a cave, while police arrest Blatt for smuggling heroin upon finding the drug hidden inside. Poirot later invites everyone to a picnic, which he uses to secretly observe their behaviour and test their vertigo. Following the picnic, Linda attempts suicide with Christine's sleeping pills. Poirot later discovers she felt guilt-ridden, after assuming she killed her step-mother through voodoo. Via a request for similar cases to the current one, Poirot receives details on the strangulation of Alice Corrigan from Surrey police ‚Äì her body was found by a local teacher, while her husband Edward had an alibi. Poirot is supplied with a photo of both people. Bringing together the suspects, Poirot denounces Patrick and Christine Redfern for Arlena's murder. She had been murdered to prevent her husband learning that she had been conned into investing a large inheritance towards \\"fabulous opportunities\\". The murder was well-planned to falsify the time of death. While Christine was with Linda, she set Linda's watch forward twenty minutes, asked for the time to set her alibi, then returned the watch to the correct time. Afterwards, Christine returned to her room and applied fake suntan makeup, which she concealed from sight, before tossing the bottle out the window. Sneaking out to Pixy Cove, Christine made certain Arlena saw her; Patrick had instructed Arlena to hide should his wife turn up before their rendezvous. Once Arlena was gone, Christine impersonated the dead body to fool Brewster, and once he had left to get help while Patrick remained behind, Christine rushed back to the hotel to remove the makeup. Patrick then called out an unsuspecting Arlena and strangled her. Poirot reveals that Christine lied about having a fear of heights, as she managed to traverse a suspended bridge during the picnic, and foolishly threw out the bottle of makeup from her room when Brewster was present outside. Linda's attempt at suicide was provoked by her. As further proof, Poirot reveals that the murder of Alice Corrigan happened in the same manner ‚Äì the photo from Surrey Police identified Patrick as Edward Corrigan, who killed her, and Christine as the teacher who found the \\"body\\", before the murder had been committed. Poirot goads Patrick into a near-violent fury to expose himself, despite his wife trying to keep him quiet. With the case closed, Poirot tells Linda she did not kill Arlena and predicts she will not hate her next \\"step-mother\\", whereupon Kenneth and Rosamund rekindle their old love.

Literary significance and reception The verdict by Maurice Willson Disher in The Times Literary Supplement of 14 June 1941 was positive: \\"To maintain a place at the head of detective-writers would be difficult enough without the ever increasing rivalry. Even Miss Christie cannot stay there unchallenged though she has a following which will swear her books are best without reading the others. Unbiased opinion may have given the verdict against her last season when new arrivals set a very hot pace; but Evil Under the Sun will take a lot of beating now.\\" After summarising the plot, Disher concluded: \\"Miss Christie casts the shadow of guilt upon first one and then another with such casual ease that it is difficult for the reader not to be led by the nose. Everybody is well aware that any character most strongly indicated is not a likely criminal; yet this guiding principle is forgotten when Miss Christie persuades you that you are more discerning than you really are. Then she springs her secret like a land-mine.\\"The Times Literary Supplement, 14 June 1941 (p. 285) In The New York Times Book Review of 19 October 1941, Isaac Anderson wrote, \\"The murder is an elaborately planned affair ‚Äì a little too much so for credibility, in view of the many possibilities of a slip-up somewhere along the way ‚Äì but Poirot's reasoning is flawless, as it always is. Evil Under the Sun adds another to the already long list of Agatha Christie's successful mystery tales.\\"The New York Times Book Review, 19 October 1941 (p. 26) Maurice Richardson in a short review in the 8 June 1941 issue of The Observer said, \\"Best Agatha Christie since Ten Little [Indians] ‚Äì and one can't say much more than that ‚Äì Evil Under the Sun has luxury summer hotel, closed-circle setting, Poirot in white trousers.

Punshon in The Guardian of 26 August 1941 briefly summed up the plot in a eulogistic piece which began, \\"Is it going too far to call Mrs. Agatha Christie one of the most remarkable writers of the day?\\"The Guardian, 26 August 1941 (p. 3) Robert Barnard: \\"The classic Christie marital triangle plot set in West Country seaside resort, with particular play on the alikeness of sunbathing bodies, and dead ones. Possibly overingenious and slightly uncharacterised.\\"Barnard, Robert. A Talent to Deceive ‚Äì an appreciation of Agatha Christie (revised edition; p. 204). Fontana Books, 1990; References to other works The plot has some similarities to the Christie short story \\"Triangle at Rhodes\\", which was first published in the US in This Week magazine in February 1936 and in the UK in issue 545 of the Strand Magazine in May 1936, and included in the collection Murder in the Mews (US title: Dead Man's Mirror) one year later. In \\"Triangle at Rhodes\\", Poirot again witnesses an apparent liaison between two married people. Again everyone believes that the responsible party is the beautiful Valentine Chantry, who is the murder victim. In \\"Triangle at Rhodes\\" the murder is by poison and it is thought that Chantry and her lover attempted to murder her husband and that the plot went wrong. Poirot, however, reveals that the murder was committed by Chantry's husband in cahoots with her apparent lover's wife, Mrs Gold, who intended to frame her hapless husband. In both stories, the key twist is that the appearance of the seductress' power deflects attention from the reality of the situation. In \\"Triangle at Rhodes\\", Mrs Gold says of Valentine Chantry \\"in spite of her money and her good looks and all [...] she's not the sort of woman men really stick to. She's the sort of woman, I think, that men would get tired of very easily.\\" In Evil under the Sun, Poirot says of Arlena Marshall that she \\"[w]as the type of woman whom men care for easily and of whom they easily tire.\\" The character of Colonel Weston had originally appeared in Peril at End House and makes reference to that case upon his first appearance, in Chapter 5. Minor character Mrs Gardener is herself an admirer of Poirot's exploits and refers to the case of Death on the Nile in Chapter 1 of this novel. The title refers to Ecclesiastes 6:1, which reads, \\"There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy upon humankind.\\" (New Revised Standard Version of the Bible) Ecclesiastes 6:2 continues, \\"those to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that they lack nothing of all that they desire, yet God does not enable them to enjoy these things, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous ill.\\" Film, radio, TV or theatrical adaptations =Radio= John Moffatt starred as Poirot in a 1999 six-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation directed by Enyd Williams with a cast that included Iain Glen as Patrick Redfern, Fiona Fullerton as Arlena Marshall, Robin Ellis as Captain Marshall, Wendy Craig as Mrs Gardener, George Baker as Colonel Weston, and Joan Littlewood as Miss Brewster. =1982 film= The novel was adapted into a film in 1982, and was the second film to star Peter Ustinov as Poirot, after his debut in the same role in the 1978 film Death on the Nile. His co-stars included Dame Maggie Smith, Diana Rigg, Denis Quilley, Roddy McDowall, James Mason, and Sylvia Miles. While the general plot of the murder remained the same, the film adaptation featured a number of changes to it: * The setting was shifted to a secluded resort frequented by the rich and famous in the Adriatic Sea - this setting was filmed in Mallorca, Spain. * Horace Blatt is a millionaire with a knighthood and not a heroin smuggler. Blatt was in a previous relationship with Arlena before she married Kenneth. He is investigated by Poirot for trying to insure a fake jewel, and reveals when interviewed that Arlena took the real jewel, but not before having it copied and giving the copy to Blatt. The real jewel later disappears during the murder, but is found in Patrick's possession by Poirot when he finds evidence to prove him as Arlena's murderer. * Alice Corrigan's surname is changed to Ruber, and her murder occurs on the Yorkshire Moors. Poirot is involved in the investigation of her murder, through her insurance company that Blatt also uses, but while finding nothing, he retains the paperwork. This he later uses to help him prove Patrick's involvement in the murder, to reveal the handwriting on Alice's policy and cheque signed by him are the same. Poirot further adds that the surname of Ruber he used when he married Alice, is Latin for \\"Redfern\\"; Patrick's occupation in the past was a teacher in Latin. * Christine Redfern's claim to have a fear of heights is exposed by Linda's account on the day of the murder. She had recalled Christine waving to her from the edge of a cliff. Poirot reveals this as part of his denouement. Christine also has Linda wear a swimming cap to muffle the sound of a cannon which fires at 12 o'clock, this plot element did not feature in the novel. * Emily Brewster is changed to a man called Rex Brewster, the author of Arlena's yet-to-be-published tell-all biography. * Linda Marshall does not attempt murder, is not suspected of the murder, and does not attempt suicide. * The Gardeners are theatrical producers, who resent the fact that Arlena left a production of theirs on medical grounds; the pair question if this was done on purpose. Carrie is renamed Myra and is American instead. Myra replaces Brewster when going with Patrick on a boat to find Arlena's supposed dead body. *Major Barry, Inspector Colgate, and Reverend Stephen Lane are excluded from the story while Rosamund Darnley is renamed Daphne Castle acting as a former co-star of Arlena's and a hotel proprietor who has sympathy for Kenneth and Linda due to Arlena's treatment. =Agatha Christie's Poirot= An adaptation of the novel was made for Agatha Christie's Poirot in 2001, starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. Filming for this episode mainly took place at the Burgh Island Hotel, Devon, a location which was inspiration for the original novel and And Then There Were None. Much of the plot remained the same as the novel, though the adaptation made a few changes: * The characters of Carrie and Odell Gardener, Inspector Colgate and Dr Neasdon are omitted. * The characters of Captain Hastings, Inspector Japp and Miss Lemon are included into the story. Hastings provides assistance in the case; Japp is the investigating officer; Miss Lemon makes inquiries into Alice Corrigan's murder at Poirot's request. * The hotel is a health retreat under a different name. Poirot is mainly there to recover from ill health, after collapsing during the opening night of a new restaurant; when the case is completed, it is revealed his collapse was from food poisoning caused by the poor standards of hygiene at the restaurant. * Linda Marshall is changed to a son called Lionel. He is found to be reading a book about poisoning, but doesn't attempt suicide in the course of the investigation. * Christine does not make a claim that she has a fear of heights; this detail is omitted. She also applies the fake tan and throws out the bottle containing it, before she leaves to join Lionel. =Video game adaptation= On 17 October 2007, The Adventure Company released a PC adaptation of the book. The game features actor Kevin Delaney as the voice of Hercule Poirot. This version includes the character of Captain Hastings as the player-character; as a game, Poirot re-creates the story, but allows Hastings to step into Poirot's shoes and solve the mystery as he would.

It is sometimes referred to as the Scottish literary renaissance, although its influence went beyond literature into music, visual arts, and politics (among other fields). The writers and artists of the Scottish Renaissance displayed a profound interest in both modern philosophy and technology, as well as incorporating folk influences, and a strong concern for the fate of Scotland's declining languages. It has been seen as a parallel to other movements elsewhere, including the Irish Literary Revival, the Harlem Renaissance (in America), the Bengal Renaissance (in Kolkata, India) and the Jindyworobak Movement (in Australia), which emphasised indigenous folk traditions. Beginnings The term \\"Scottish Renaissance\\" was brought into critical prominence by the French Languedoc poet and scholar Denis Saurat in his article \\"\\", which was published in the ' in April 1924.I. Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (1995) p. 839. The term had appeared much earlier, however, in the work of the polymathic Patrick GeddesP. Geddes, The Scots Renascence, in The Evergreen: A Northern Seasonal, Spring 1895, Patrick Geddes and Colleagues, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh and in a 1922 book review by Christopher Murray Grieve (\\"Hugh MacDiarmid\\") for the Scottish Chapbook that predicted a \\"Scottish Renascence as swift and irresistible as was the Belgian Revival between 1880 and 1910\\",Quoted in Margery Palmer McCulloch, ed., Modernism and Nationalism: Literature and Society in Scotland 1918-1939. Glasgow: Association for Scottish Literary Studies, 2004. 52-53. involving such figures as Lewis Spence and Marion Angus.I. Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (1995), p. 839. These earlier references make clear the connections between the Scottish Renaissance and the Celtic Twilight and Celtic Revival movements of the late 19th century, which helped reawaken a spirit of cultural nationalism among Scots of the modernist generations. Where these earlier movements had been steeped in a sentimental and nostalgic Celticism, however, the modernist-influenced Renaissance would seek a rebirth of Scottish national culture that would both look back to the medieval \\"makar\\" poets, William Dunbar and Robert Henrysoun, as well as look towards such contemporary influences as T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and D. H. Lawrence, or (more locally) R. B. Cunninghame Graham.D. Daiches ed., The Penguin Companion to Literature 1 (1971) p. 333. The turn of the 20th century saw the first stirrings of a new era in Scottish arts and letters. As writers such as George Douglas Brown railed against the \\"Kailyard school\\" that had come to dominate Scottish letters, producing satiric, realist accounts of Scottish rural life in novels like The House with the Green Shutters (1901), Scots language poets such as Violet Jacob and Marion Angus undertook a quiet revival of regionally inflected poetry in the Lowland vernacular. The aforementioned Patrick Geddes would continue his foundational work in town and regional planning, developing the triad \\"Place - Work - Folk\\" as a matrix for new thinking about the relationships between people and their local environments. In the realm of visual arts, John Duncan would refine his Celtic myth inspired Symbolist painting to include an increasing emphasis on collage and the flatness of the image. In architecture and the decorative arts, the towering figures of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow Four would give Scotland its very own \\"school\\" of modern design and help create the \\"Glasgow style\\". Scotland in the early 20th century was experiencing an efflorescence of creative activity, but there was not yet a sense of a particular shared movement or an overt national inflection to all of this artistic effort. Literary renaissance A bust of Hugh MacDiarmid sculpted in 1927 by William Lamb It was not until the literary efforts of Hugh MacDiarmid that the Scottish Renaissance can properly be said to have begun. Starting in 1920, C. M. Grieve (having not yet adopted his nom de plume of Hugh MacDiarmid) began publishing a series of three short anthologies entitled Northern Numbers: Being Representative Selections from Certain Living Scottish Poets (including works by John Buchan, Violet Jacob, Neil Munro, and Grieve himself). These anthologies, which appeared one each year from 1920‚Äì22, along with his founding and editing of the Scottish Chapbook review (in the annus mirabilis of Modernism, 1922), established Grieve/MacDiarmid as the father and central figure of the burgeoning Scottish Renaissance movement that he had prophesied.D. Daiches ed., The Penguin Companion to Literature 1 (London: Penguin, 1971), p. 333. By about 1925, MacDiarmid had largely abandoned his English language poetry and began to write in a kind of \\"synthetic Scots\\" known as Lallans, that was a hybrid of regional Scots dialects and lexicographical artifacts exhumed from Jamieson's Dictionary of the Scottish Language, often grafted onto a Standard English grammatical structure. His poetic works included \\"A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle\\" (1926). This had an electrifying effect on the literary landscape of the time.D. Daiches ed., The Penguin Companion to Literature 1 (London: Penguin, 1971) p. 333. Other writers soon followed in MacDiarmid's footsteps and also wrote in Lallans, including the poets Edwin Muir (1887‚Äì1959) and William Soutar (1898‚Äì1943), who pursued an exploration of identity, rejecting nostalgia and parochialism and engaging with social and political issues. Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch (1909‚Äì1981) and Sydney Goodsir Smith (1915‚Äì1975). The Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan (1920‚Äì2010) became known for translations of works from a wide range of European languages. He was also the first Scots Makar (the official national poet), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. Alexander Gray was an academic and poet, but is chiefly remembered for his translations into Scots from the German and Danish ballad traditions into Scots, including Arrows. A Book of German Ballads and Folksongs Attempted in Scots (1932) and Four-and-Forty. A Selection of Danish Ballads Presented in Scots (1954).J. Corbett, Written in the Language of the Scottish Nation: A History of Literary Translation Into Scots (Multilingual Matters, 1999), , pp. 161-4. The Scottish Renaissance increasingly concentrated on the novel, particularly after the 1930s when Hugh MacDiarmid was in isolation in Shetland and its leadership moved to novelist Neil Gunn (1891‚Äì1973). Gunn's novels, beginning with The Grey Coast (1926), and including Highland River (1937) and The Green Isle of the Great Deep (1943), were largely written in English and not the Scots preferred by MacDiarmid, focused on the Highlands of his birth and were notable for their narrative experimentation. Other major figures associated with the movement include George Blake (1893‚Äì1961), A. J. Cronin (1896‚Äì1981), Eric Linklater (1899‚Äì1974) and Lewis Grassic Gibbon (1901‚Äì35). There were also a large number of female authors associated with the movement, who demonstrated a growing feminine consciousness. They included Catherine Carswell (1879‚Äì1946), Willa Muir (1890‚Äì1970), Nan Shepherd (1893‚Äì1981) and most prolifically Naomi Mitchison (1897‚Äì1999). All were born within a fifteen-year period and, although they cannot be described as members of a single school, they all pursued an exploration of identity, rejecting nostalgia and parochialism and engaging with social and political issues. Physician A. J. Cronin is now often seen as sentimental, but his early work, particularly his first novel Hatter's Castle (1931) and his most successful The Citadel (1937) were a deliberate reaction against the Kailyard tradition, exposing the hardships and vicissitudes of the lives of ordinary people,R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: a History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), , p. 587. He was the most translated Scottish author in the twentieth century.P. Barnaby and T. Hubbard, \\"The international reception and impact of Scottish literature of the period since 1918\\", in I. Brown, ed., The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Modern transformations: new identities (from 1918) (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 32. George Blake pioneered the exploration of the experiences of the working class in his major works such as The Shipbuilders (1935). Eric Linklater produced comedies of the absurd including Juan in America (1931) dealing with prohibition America, and a critique of modern war in Private Angelo (1946). Lewis Grassic Gibbon, the pseudonym of James Leslie Mitchell, produced one of the most important realisations of the ideas of the Scottish Renaissance in his trilogy A Scots Quair (Sunset Song, 1932, Cloud Howe, 1933 and Grey Granite, 1934), which mixed different Scots dialects with the narrative voice.C. Craig, \\"Culture: modern times (1914-): the novel\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 157-9. Other works that investigated the working class included James Barke's (1905‚Äì58), Major Operation (1936) and The Land of the Leal (1939) and J. F. Hendry's (1912‚Äì86) Fernie Brae (1947). The parallel revitalisation of Gaelic poetry, known as the Scottish Gaelic Renaissance, was largely due to the work of Sorley Maclean (Somhairle MacGill-Eain, 1911‚Äì96). A native of Skye and a native Gaelic speaker, he abandoned the stylistic conventions of the tradition and opened up new possibilities for composition with his poem (Poems to Eimhir, 1943). His work inspired a new generation to take up (the new poetry). These included George Campbell Hay (, 1915‚Äì1984), Lewis-born poets Derick Thomson (, 1921‚Äì2012) and Iain Crichton Smith (, 1928‚Äì98). They all focused on the issues of exile, the fate of the Gaelic language and bi-culturalism.J. MacDonald, \\"Gaelic literature\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 255-7. Art Stanley Cursiter, Regatta, (1913) The ideas of a distinctive modern Scottish art were expressed in the inter-war period by figures including Stanley Cursiter (1887‚Äì1976), William McCance (1894‚Äì1970), William Johnstone (1897‚Äì1981) and J. D. Fergusson (1874‚Äì1961).D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460-1990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , p. 348. Stanley Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and Futurism, as can be seen in his Rain on Princes Street (1913) and Regatta (1913). He went on to be a major painter of the coastline of his native Orkney, director of the National Gallery of Scotland and proposed the creation of a National Gallery of Modern Art in 1930.M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 163-4. Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism and probably played a major part in the formulation of MacDiarmid's thought. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings like Damaged Destroyer (1918). He co-operated with MacDiarmid on the journal Scottish Art and Letters and MacDiarmid quoted extensively from his work.D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460-1990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , p. 350. William McCance's early work was in a bold post- impressionist style. After World War I he moved to London with his wife, fellow student Agnes Miller Parker (1895-1980), where he joined the same circles as Fergusson, vorticist Wyndham Lewis (1882-1957) and nationalist composer Francis George Scott. Under these influences his work became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, as can be seen in Women on an Elevator (1925) and The Engineer and his Wife (1925).D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460-1990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , pp. 348-50. William Johnstone (1897‚Äì1981) was a cousin of F. G. Scott and met MacDiarmid while a student at Edinburgh. He studied cubism, surrealism and was introduced to new American art by his wife the sculptor Flora Macdonald. He moved towards abstraction, attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, A Point in Time (1929‚Äì38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as \\"one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century and one of the most remarkable pictures by any British painter in the period\\".D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460-1990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , pp. 351-2.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , p. 173.D. Macmillan, \\"Review: Painters in Parallel: William Johnstone & William Gillies\\", Scotsman.com, 19 January 2012, retrieved 8 May 2012. Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907‚Äì98) and Edward Baird (1904‚Äì49). Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose. Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of Bruegel and focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick's Traquair House (1938) and more overtly Baird's The Birth of Venus (1934). Before his success in painting, McIntosh Patrick gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included William Wilson (1905‚Äì72) and Ian Fleming (1906-94).M. MacDonald, Scottish Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), , pp. 175-6. Music and dance The ideas of the Scottish Renaissance were brought to classical music by Francis George Scott (1880‚Äì1958), MacDiarmid's former teacher, who set to music several of the poet's works.M. P. McCulloch, Scottish Modernism and Its Contexts 1918-1959: Literature, National Identity and Cultural Exchange (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), , p. 37. Lancashire-born Ronald Stevenson (b. 1938) collaborated with Scott and both wrote in twelve-tone technique. Stevenson developed a musical idiom derived from Scottish music, creating settings of folk songs including concertos for his instrument, the piano (1966 and 1972). He also adapted work by Scottish Renaissance poets such as MacDiarmid, Sorley Maclean and William Soutar. The influence of Dmitri Shostakovich (1906‚Äì1975) was evident in the initials used in his large-scale piano work Passacaglia on DSCH (1963).M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. 193-8. Robin Orr (1909‚Äì2006) and Cedric Thorpe Davie (1913‚Äì1983) were influenced by modernism and Scottish musical cadences. The influence of modernism can also be heard in the work of Erik Chisholm (1904‚Äì1965) in his Pibroch Piano Concerto (1930) and the Straloch suite for Orchestra (1933) and the sonata An Riobhan Dearg (1939). In 1928 he founded the Scottish Ballet Society (later the Celtic Ballet) with choreographer Margaret Morris, the long term partner of J. D. Fergusson. Together they created several ballets, including The Forsaken Mermaid (1940). He was also instrumental in the foundation of the Active Society for the Propagation of Contemporary Music, for which he brought leading composers to Glasgow to perform their work. Decline and influence Scottish Poetry Library, Crichton's Close, Edinburgh. The Scottish Renaissance revived interest in Scottish poetry Although many of the participants were to live until the 1970s and later, the truly revolutionary aspect of the Scottish Renaissance can be said to have been over by the 1960s, when it became eclipsed by various other movements, often international in nature. The most famous clash was at the 1962 Edinburgh Writers Festival, where Hugh MacDiarmid denounced Alexander Trocchi, a younger Scottish writer, as \\"cosmopolitan scum\\", and Trocchi claimed \\"sodomy\\" as a basis for his own writing. This is often seen as a clash of the generations, although it is rarely reported that the two writers corresponded with each other later, and became friends. Both were controversialists of sorts. The Scottish Renaissance also had a profound effect on the Scottish independence movement, and the roots of the Scottish National Party may be said to be firmly in it. The revival in both of Scotland's indigenous languages is partly drawn from the renaissance. Major figures Other people connected with the Scottish renaissance, not mentioned previously, are listed below. Note: These figures were not all contemporaries of the first generation of Scottish Renaissance writers and artists who emerged in the 1920s and 1930s. However, most did become involved with the movement in some form through interactions with figures such as Gunn or MacDiarmid, even if at a slightly later date.

The term \\"frills\\" originally refers to a style of fabric decoration. Something offered to customers for no additional charge may be designated as a \\"frill\\" - for example, free drinks on airline journeys, or a radio installed in a rental car. No-frills businesses operate on the principle that by removing luxurious additions, customers may be offered lower prices. Common products and services for which no-frills brands exist include budget airlines, supermarkets, vacations and used vehicles. No-frills supermarkets The aisles of an Aldi supermarket in Germany (2006) No-frills supermarkets are recognisable by their store design and business model. *They do not decorate aisles and sometimes do not even restock shelves with foods. In this case, pallets of the products on offer are simply parked alongside the aisles, and customers picking up products will gradually empty them. When all items on a pallet have been sold, they are replaced. Prices are given on plain labels. *Queueing at the checkout is relatively common, as staffing levels reflect average demand rather than peak demand. At actual peak times, customers often have to wait. *Shopping bags are charged for, as they are seen as a frill. Thus many shoppers bring reusable shopping bags, buy shopping bags at a low fee, put their shopping in the cardboard boxes that the products originally came in, or put it directly in their shopping cart; customers must bag their own purchases. *They somewhat employ the Pareto principle when choosing which goods to offer, meaning that in most supermarkets, 20% of products on sale account for 80% of what customers buy. Therefore, they only stock the most commonly sold products. *They only take cash and debit cards (although this has changed in many chains over the years due to increasingly prevalence and usage of credit cards). *They only open at peak times, e.g., 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday, although some stores are open 24 hours. *They often do not sell branded items, except in the case of special purchases, which are almost always at a discounted price. Instead, they sell generic or private label products. *Products are sold in one size, which is usually the best selling size of that product, rather than multiple different sizes of the product. *The shopping carts have a coin-operated slot, to ensure that the trolleys are kept on site. *They usually lack a butcher shop, bakery or deli counters, thus meat, and cold meats are sold precut in chilled vacuum packs. *Unlike regular supermarkets which have separate teams of staff for the shop floor, the back warehouse, doing the cleaning and dealing with the clerical work. No frills supermarkets instead have a single multi-tasking team of workers dealing with all aspects of supermarket work. *No in-store background music, although some use satellite radio. Examples of no-frills supermarket chains include: *Dia, Minipre√ßo and Ed are all part of the Dia Group, which is in turn part of the Carrefour Group. (Brazil, Spain) No-frills automobiles In the United States, a no-frills automobile model typically has a minimum of convenience equipment, a less powerful engine and spartan trim. Frequently, these models represent the lowest-priced version of a larger selection of more lavishly equipped and trimmed models of that same car. Often, the less-expensive models are sold with a manual transmission and have a shorter options list. Early 1950s American examples include the Chevrolet 150 and Kaiser-Frazer Henry J. These were larger cars than those produced in the US in the 1940s gasoline rationing period by Crosley, who shut down in 1952. One of the more famous no- frills cars was the Studebaker Scotsman, which was on sale from 1957 to 1958. These cars came with a low-grade cloth-trimmed front seat and contained only a driver's side sunvisor, minimal soundproofing, no door armrests and painted trim (in lieu of chrome trim); even routine convenience items, such as a cigarette lighter and dome light were deleted. Buyers were allowed to buy only a low-cost heater and a few other trim and convenience items from a short options list; a radio was not offered as an option on this model (unlike Studebaker's more expensive models). During the 1960s and early 1970s, American automakers offered several trim levels of full-sized models (each having a different name), with a price-leading no-frills versions. Examples included the Chevrolet Biscayne, Ford Custom 500, and Plymouth Fury I. While ostensibly targeted toward fleet buyers and business customers where luxury is not a concern, these cars were also available to private customers. While many of these cars were typically sold with the standard six-cylinder or basic V-8 engine with the standard three-speed manual transmission, many of these price- leading models were also available with the full range of engines and transmissions, including those that were performance-oriented, unlike the later no-frills models that had restricted performance options. Additionally, marketing brochures typically extolled the virtues of these economy models, pointing out such features as durable and easy-to-care for upholstery with wide color availability, beauty in styling despite minimal exterior trim adornment, and features shared with more luxurious models such as suspension and ride quality, engine and transmission availability, and standard safety and convenience features‚Äîall available even for budget-conscious buyers.\\"Biscayne: Thrifiest to buy of all big Chevrolets,\\" 1962 Chevrolet brochure, pages 10-11. By the late 1960s, a vast majority of all price- leading models were built and sold with V-8 engines and automatic transmission, as consumer needs were changing, and were even being built and sold with luxury comfort and convenience features once seen only on the higher-priced model lines, including air conditioning and power steering. Only a small handful of base model vehicles were sold with the basic six- cylinder/three-speed manual transmission power team and stripped of all options by this time, and by the early 1970s, Plymouth, Ford and Chevrolet had switched to all V-8 engine/automatic transmission power teams for the full- sized model lines. With customers turning more to volume models that were better trimmed, upholstered and equipped (even with price a primary consideration), the Big Three dropped their Spartan-trimmed price-leading models, such as the Chevrolet Biscayne and Ford Custom, or relegated them completely to fleet sales with no private buyer availability. During the gasoline crisis of the 1970s, many American automakers began offering no- frills models on their compact lines of cars (such as the Ford Pinto MPG, and Plymouth Duster \\"Feather Duster\\"). As before, these models usually had spartan trim (vinyl seats with rubber floor covering); fewer convenience items than the more expensive models (e.g., no cigarette lighter); lighter-weight components (such as aluminum on various engine, body and suspension components); and a manual transmission. The no-frills Tata Nano The no-frills 2004 Dacia Logan Most no-frills cars are sold to fleet buyers, such as taxi companies or police departments. However, these models are generally available to cost-conscious private customers whose primary concerns were price, fuel economy and basic low-cost transportation. The concept of a no-frills car in the European market was common in the 1950s with cars such as the Ford Abeille or the Citro√´n ID Normale. The Dacia Logan is an example of a recent no-frills car in Europe. Another example is Fiat Albea. In Argentina and Brazil, the no- frills category takes a considerable share of the new car market. Examples of cost cuts in base versions include: * very little or no soundproofing * low quality plastics * substitution of rubber on the dashboard to cheaper (rough) plastic * string-based instead of acceleration-based seatbelt retraction mechanisms * no seatbelt height adjustment * no anti-lock braking systems or airbags, except where required by law * no seat height adjustment * no steering wheel adjustments * cheaper paint processes * facelifted models instead of new generations such as Volkswagen Santana, Fiat Palio, Fiat Uno, Volkswagen Kombi, Volkswagen Citi Golf, Chevrolet Corsa * cast iron cylinder heads and engine blocks * no lambda sensor * retrofitting old generation components (older, less efficient engines, platforms, dashboard components) on a European designed vehicle: Ford Fiesta, Fiat Idea, Fiat Punto, Vauxhall Meriva, Volkswagen Polo * no lamps on the lateral direction lights or remotion of the lateral direction lights at all * single-piece plastic bumpers; any grills are designed by placing indentations on the plastic * low-quality springs on the suspension, compensated by a taller and harder adjustment * less maintenance on the tools used to build the vehicles * smaller and more restrictive catalytic converters In some markets, often in the developing world, very aggressive forms of no-frills cars may be available. For example, the supermini and city cars sold at the Mercosur markets, such as the Chevrolet Celta, Chevrolet Corsa, Fiat Uno, Fiat Palio, Ford Ka and Volkswagen Gol tend to be noisy and feature cost cuttings like: No-frills airlines Interior of a Ryanair no-frills aircraft No-frills airlines are airlines that offer low fares but eliminate all non-essential services, such as complimentary food, in-flight entertainment systems, and business-class seating. A no-frills airline will typically cut overhead by flying from more remote airports (with lower access charges) and by using a single type of aircraft. Aircraft cabin interiors may be fitted out with minimum comforts, dispensing with luxuries such as seat-back video screens, reclining seats and blinds; some airlines choose to carry advertising inside the cabin to increase revenue. Should meals be served, they must be paid for in full. Some airlines also extend the definition of \\"frills\\" to include standard services and conveniences; for example, a no-frills airline may charge passengers an additional fee for check-in luggage, using airport check-in desks, or even providing wheelchairs. No frills hotels Another example of a type of no frills is lodgings. In some ways when they remove the frills, the accommodation can hover the line between a hotel and a hostel. Notable no- frills chains include Motel 6, Econo Lodge, Tune Hotels, Ibis Budget, easyHotel and Zip by Premier Inn. An example of a no-frills hotel room. This case is a Motel 6 room in Massachusetts. Features of no-frills hotels rooms are that themselves are smaller and more spartan in trim. Examples and cases included with Zip rooms are twice as small (8.5 m¬≤) as standard Premier Inn rooms. (20 m¬≤), beds in Econo Lodge are put on boxes, so to make cleaning easier and with many Ibis Budget hotels, the reception is only opened at limited hours. Most no frills hotels don't have door keys, instead they use either inexpensive swipe-keys or digital door locks. Many of them have no pictures on the walls, baths in the bathrooms or excessive furniture like minibars, fridges or dressing tables. Bedding is limited to pillows and duvets. Some like Tune and easyHotel even go as far as putting advertisements on the walls and in case of Zip some rooms even having no windows, instead having a sunlight-powered light box. Like no frills airlines which charge people for seat reservations and food, no frills hotels themselves charge extra for any superfluous extras like non-basic TV channels, breakfasts; which themselves are just limited to a continental style, tea-and-coffee making facilities, Wi-Fi internet, daily maid service; normally cleaning the room is only done when the guest leaves, and toiletries & supplement towels. No- frills holiday No-frills holidays are holidays which, like no-frills airlines, do not include unnecessary services such as: * in-flight meals * travel representatives * transfers between the airport and the hotel * entertainment * luxury accommodation Such holidays usually have a simple fare scheme, in which fares typically increase during peak seasons, and also as more people sign up for the holiday. This rewards early reservations, and is known as \\"yield management\\". Examples of no-frills holiday companies are: * Just, part of the Thomson/TUI group * Qbic, low-cost design hotels No-frills gyms Compared from regular fitness gyms, there has been a growing number of no frills gyms. No frills gyms are noted from regular gyms. These differ in noted ways include: * No reception: everything like registration and booking classes is done online. * No fitness classes, or fitness classes are available at a supplementary cost on top of regular monthly membership fees. * No swimming pool, hot tub, sauna, solarium or beauty spa, due to the cost of running such facilities, e.g., needing to have a staff member there at all times and frequent cleaning. * No caf√© or relaxation room, drinks and snacks are available through vending machines. * Most of the fitness machines are self-powered, rather than electrically powered thus cutting down of power costs and running costs. Examples of no frills gyms are easyGym, Fit4less and PureGym in the UK, Basic-Fit in Benelux and France, and McFit in Germany. No frills filling stations 275x275px In the Netherlands and other European countries, you can find no frills filling stations. These are petrol stations that consist of a series of self-service petrol and diesel fuel dispensers that you pay with a bank card. There are no other facilities on-site like kiosks, toilets, car washes or water & air pumps, plus many don't have loyalty programmes. If there is a problem, drivers are to call a hotline using an on- site telephone where the station owners will be alerted to the site, and if needs be cut the fuel to the pumps. Due to the nature of these sites, they are usually opened 24/7, except in the Dutch Bible belt like Urk where due to local by-laws they must closed on a Sunday. Notable chains includes Dutch chains Tango, Q8 Easy, TinQ, Firezone, Esso Express & Shell Express, and the Austrian chain Diskont. Other no-frills companies Other examples of no- frills companies include: cinemas (easyCinema), bus companies (easyBus, Magic Bus (Stagecoach), Eastern), food ranges (Tesco Value, Walmart/Asda SmartPrice), mobile phone companies (easyMobile, Telmore), and marketing (low- cost marketing).

The game was developed by Clover Studio and published by Capcom in 2004 for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. The game's story begins precisely where the original Viewtiful Joe left off, with the beginning of an alien invasion of Movieland by a villainous organization called \\"Gedow\\". The group is led by an unseen being known as the \\"Black Emperor\\", whose proclaims his goal to collect the special Rainbow Oscars, seven statuettes which contain the \\"power of the happy ending\\". Straight from their previous adventure, superhero Viewtiful Joe and his girlfriend Sexy Silvia quickly charge themselves with stopping Gedow's evil plans. Very similar to its predecessor, Viewtiful Joe 2 is a combination of 2D and 3D cel-shaded graphics with action, platforming, and beat 'em up gameplay elements. Using either of the characters Viewtiful Joe or Sexy Silvia, the player must utilize \\"VFX Powers\\" in order to battle enemies and solve puzzles. An integral part of the gameplay, these special abilities include being able to slow down, speed up, zoom into, or replay the onscreen action. Also akin to the original game, Viewtiful Joe 2 sold modestly but garnered considerable praise from critics due to its stylish graphics and gameplay. Gameplay The Replay VFX Power allows Sexy Silvia to attack three times in succession for triple the normal damage. Viewtiful Joe 2 is a 2D beat 'em up which combines side-scrolling and platforming. The player takes control of either of the characters Joe or Silvia to complete tasks within each stage, such as defeating enemies and bosses, and solving puzzles. Within Movieworld, Joe has \\"VFX Powers\\" such as Slow (similar to bullet-time), Mach Speed, and Zoom at his disposal to defeat the enemy. He is joined by girlfriend Silvia, who has also acquired VFX powers. However, Silvia has \\"Replay\\", which allows her to record and repeat an event three times in succession, instead of Joe's Mach Speed. The Replay power must be used wisely, as although it allow the player to do three times the amount of damage on an enemy, being hit while using it will incur three times the amount of damage to the player. During the game, the player utilize a gameplay mechanic called \\"Viewtiful Switch\\" in order to swap between Joe and Silvia at any time. The two characters share both their amount of health and the VFX meter. Holding the switch button down for a certain amount of time enables the two player characters to use a special attack involving the transformable robot Six Machine. At intervals between stages, V-Points can be spent to purchase new moves for either Joe or Silvia, or to improve their existing powers, which includes making Joe's Mach Speed more effective or upgrading Silvia's Desperados. V-Points can additionally be spent to give the player more maximum health, add extra lives, or be used to buy power-ups such as the VFX Turbo Charger, which slows the drainage of the VFX Gauge. Aside from the main game, Viewtiful Joe 2 also contains an optional gameplay extra called the \\"36 Chambers of Viewtiful\\", a series of stages which test the player's skills. The objectives include defeating a set number of enemies or scoring a number of V-Points within a time limit, and dodging an onslaught of swords without dying. Plot The plot of Viewtiful Joe 2 continues immediately from the ending of the previous game. Having just saved Movieland, Viewtiful Joe and his girlfriend (and new partner) Sexy Silvia learn from Captain Blue that the world will be threatened twice more. Joe and Silvia leave Captain Blue's space station to attend to an alien invasion from the forces of Gedow. The leader of Gedow, the Black Emperor, suddenly attacks Captain Blue and turns him into a statue called a \\"Rainbow Oscar\\", one of seven in a set that represents Movieland's power of the happy ending. With their power, the Black Emperor intends to conquer Movieland. Cast off to \\"the fringes\\" of Movieland by Gedow, Joe and Silvia fight their way through a prehistoric film and defeat the Tyrannosaurus rex soldier, Big John. Joe and Silvia obtain a Rainbow Oscar from Big John just as Joe's father Jet arrives in the theater and demands that they come back to the real world and clean up the mess they made. Silvia manages to convince Jet to help them rescue Captain Blue, and Jet agrees by setting up new films for her and Joe to journey through in search of the Rainbow Oscars. Joe and Silvia continue their battle against Gedow through an adventure film in an ancient temple, where a narcoleptic golem named Flinty Stone guards the second Rainbow Oscar, and then journey into a futuristic film where Gedow's top scientist Dr. Cranken and his creation Cameo Leon reveal the Black Emperor's plan to combine the Oscars with an evil reel of celluloid called the Black Film. Later, Joe's rival Alastor interferes during a samurai movie and tries to steal the spotlight. Jet changes films after Alastor is defeated, but unwittingly puts on the Black Film and sends its evil into Movieland, which also transforms Alastor into a murderous beast. After Joe defeats Alastor a second time, Jet destroys the Black Film. With four Rainbow Oscars, Joe and Silvia are sent to a movie that takes place in the frozen mountains, where Frost Tiger (brother of Fire Leo, a boss from the previous game) protects the fifth Oscar and demands that Joe prove his inner strength in order to be worthy of it. Though successful, Joe's victory is short-lived when he is fooled by an impostor Silvia into giving Gedow the Oscars. Faced with his disastrous mistake, Joe and Silvia return to the original Captain Blue movie where they encounter Dr. Cranken again. The mad scientist reveals the impostor Silvia as Miss Bloody Rachel, a shapeshifting android programmed to destroy the heroes. As Rachel transforms into the previous bosses to fight back, Joe and Silvia attempt to reason with her by introducing the concept of a heart to her programming. Slowly, Rachel begins to understand and eventually chooses to side with the heroes. After Joe and Silvia finish off Dr. Cranken for good, Rachel gives them the sixth Rainbow Oscar. The final movie, a science-fiction film set in deep space, is where the Black Emperor and the last Rainbow Oscar reside. When confronted by the heroes, the Black Emperor throws a fully restored Black Film onto the projector and uses its added power to summon his giant robot Dark Kaiser. Joe and Silvia summon their own \\"Six x Six Majin\\" to destroy Dark Kaiser and recover the last Oscar, but Jet suddenly appears in the movie and steals all seven. Revealing a Black V-Watch on his wrist, Jet transforms into the Dark Emperor and thanks Joe for giving him the Oscars, then infuses their power into himself to become Jet Black, the Dark Hero. Now able to use his Movieland powers in the real world, Jet Black crashes the Viewtiful Awards Ceremony, leaving Joe and Silvia powerless to stop him. As they put up a futile effort to fight back, the crowd starts cheering for Joe and Silvia, which gives them the power to transform and ultimately defeat Jet Black. Captain Blue is restored to normal and reveals that Jet was his best friend and cinematographer, but had found the Black Film one day and became entranced by its power and that of the Rainbow Oscars. In the end, it is revealed that all Jet really wanted was to prove himself as a hero to his own son Joe. As Joe and Jet reconcile, a dark castle appears in the distance, heralding the arrival of Captain Blue's last foreseen threat. Jet explains that the secret of the Black Film and his Black V-Watch lies within the castle, as well as an enemy unlike any other. Undeterred by Jet's ominous warning, Viewtiful Joe and Sexy Silvia strike a pose as they set out to save the world once more. Development Viewtiful Joe 2 was developed by \\"Team Viewtiful\\", a part of Capcom's subsidiary Clover Studio. The game was produced by Atsushi Inaba and directed by Masaaki Yamada. Hideki Kamiya, the director of the original Viewtiful Joe, contributed to the storyline scenario of the sequel. At the time, Kamiya was signed on as director of ≈åkami, but he wanted to write the story of Viewtiful Joe 2 to ensure continuity. Kumiko Suekane once again supervised the character designs, and Masami Ueda and Sayaka Morita co- composed the game's soundtrack. Suleputer released the soundtrack on a double album titled Viewtiful Joe + Viewtiful Joe 2 Original Soundtrack in Japan on December 22, 2004, which includes the musical scores from both games. Development on Viewtiful Joe 2 began in the August 2003, shortly after the release of the first Viewtiful Joe on the GameCube. The game was officially announced by Capcom on April 21, 2004. Despite Inaba's statement that he does not like to create sequels, he said that he did want to create another Viewtiful Joe game to include several elements that they could not fit into the original game. Inaba also noted that the team took into account the difficulty of the first game and attempted to make Viewtiful Joe 2 accessible to both casual and hardcore gamers. The GameCube and PS2 versions were developed simultaneously and feature the same content. In early previews of the game, Silvia and Joe were shown onscreen fighting at the same time, hinting at cooperative gameplay. This feature was later dropped. When the Replay VFX Power was announced, Inaba was asked if any other VFX Powers would be included in the final game. He answered, \\"In terms of adding more -- there simply aren't enough buttons on the controller\\". During the game's release in North America, Capcom and IGN held the \\"Be More Viewtiful! Sweepstakes\\", a contest in which entrants could win merchandise including either version of the game, a t-shirt with an \\"HMD\\" design, a skateboard, and a Viewtiful Joe 2 strategy guide by BradyGames. A desktop LCD clock was also released by Capcom during the game's North American debut. A demo of Viewtiful Joe 2 featured on North American PS2 preview discs made news when it was reported that playing the demo would cause a bug to completely erase all data on any inserted memory cards. Sony Computer Entertainment of America issued an apology and gave those affected a choice between several lesser-rated, previously released titles. Reception and legacy Reviews for Viewtiful Joe 2 were generally positive. The GameCube and PS2 versions hold GameRankings scores of 85% and 84% respectively. Metacritic currently lists the respective versions at 86 and 85 out of 100. IGN ranked it as the 89th best PlayStation 2 game. The staff felt that it was an example of a quality sequel. Famitsu magazine gave the GameCube version of Viewtiful Joe 2 a 28 out of 40 and gave the PS2 version a 27 out of 40. IGN gave a rating of 9.0, citing the game's deep and satisfying gameplay, and that \\"all sequels should be this good\\". During Capcom's fiscal year 2004, Viewtiful Joe 2 sold 270,000 copies in North America and 80,000 copies in Japan. The game sold poorly in United Kingdom, failing to enter the 40 top- selling games during its week of release in the region. Although the ending for Viewtiful Joe 2 suggests an immediate continuation to the plot of the series, a Viewtiful Joe 3 has not been produced. Two spin-off games (Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble and Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!) were released in 2005. Clover Studio was dissolved in 2007 and all its intellectual properties defaulted to Capcom. Many of Clover's key members including Inaba and Kamiya formed the third-party developer PlatinumGames that same year. Capcom has stated that they have no plans to continue with the Viewtiful Joe series. Kamiya has expressed interest in finishing the story of the series, however unlikely that may be.

It is dominated by Beilun port, an international port of the easternmost edge of the southern coast of Hangzhou Bay. It primarily services the regional city of Ningbo. Beilun district has 380,000 permanent residents and 850,000 residents. Beilun district has a land area of 615 square kilometers, a sea area of 258 square kilometers and a coastline of 150 kilometers. It is the largest sea area and the longest coastline area within the jurisdiction of Ningbo city. Beilun port Originally a small fishing town, the presence of a deep sea lane with year-round minimum depth of 17 meters stretching along the coast of Beilun motivated the Chinese Government to build one of the nation's largest deep sea port here. The port is further protected from storms by the mountainous islets of Zhoushan just off the coast of Beilun. 14.31 billion yuan has been invested in the Beilun port. With the completion of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge in 2008, Beilun is set to receive increased volumes of international freight and be more closely tied to the metropolis of Shanghai. It has been proposed that Beilun port be managed by the Shanghai port authority. Swift and dangerous undersea currents in Shanghai contribute to an inefficient port that costs the city a great deal to keep open, and even then it is often only usable during high tide. Beilun is also home to a small free trade zone that has a concentration of manufacturers focused on vacuum formed packaging and an older plant that manufactured window air conditioners for Fedders. Guodian Beilun Power Station, one of the world largest coal power stations, is installed in Beilun's Xinqi town, and managed by the national SOE China Guodian Corporation. Built in two phases, starting in 1988 with a loan from the World Bank, with main equipment imported from France and Japan.  Geology  Beilun district is one of the six municipal districts in Ningbo city. Beilun district stands on the coast of the east China sea. Approximately 62 CPC central committee and state leaders have visited the district for inspection and guidance. About 7000 years ago the area that now makes up the Beilun district was underwater with only the Tiantai mountains such as Taibai mountain and Lingfeng mountain visible. As the tides ebbed the land was gradually revealed and the peoples living in the area built ponds to block the tide and enclosed the sea area to set up land and improve the landscape. The regional landform of Beilun district is mainly characterized by hills and plains in the northwest and the middle, and hills in the southeast. It was separated by the Lingfeng mountain, thus, west of the mountain is the Changshan plain and east of the mountain is the Chaiqiao plain. The area is intertwined with water sources such as the Xiaolijiang, Yan, Tai, and Lujiang rivers, which originate from the southwest Shan 'ao, a piece of flat land in a mountain range, and flow through two plains. Beilun district belongs to a subtropical Marine climate, which is mild and humid, four distinct seasons, fog days less and frost-free period. It has abundant rainfall, the average annual precipitation is about 1310 mm and the average annual temperature is about 16.7‚ÑÉ.

Background and education He was the eldest son of John Collier, a merchant of Plymouth, formerly a member of the Society of Friends and MP for that town from 1832 to 1842. Robert Collier was born in 1817, and was educated at the grammar school and other schools at Plymouth till the age of sixteen, when he was placed under the tuition of Mr Kemp, subsequently rector of St James's, Piccadilly, London. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, and while there wrote some clever parodies, and published a satirical poem called 'Granta'. Ill-health compelled him to abandon reading for honours and to quit the university, to which he only returned to take the ordinary B.A. degree in 1843. Already a politician, he made some speeches at Launceston in 1841 with a view to contesting the borough in the Liberal interest, but did not go to the poll, and he was an active member of the Anti-Corn Law League and addressed the meetings in Covent Garden Theatre. Career He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in Hilary term 1843, and joined the Western Circuit and Devonshire, Plymouth, and Devonport sessions. His first important success was a brilliant defence of some Brazilian pirates at Exeter in July 1845; the prisoners were, however, condemned to death, and the judge (Baron Platt) refused to reserve a point of law on which Collier insisted. Collier hurried to London and laid the matter before the Home Secretary (Sir James Graham) and Sir Robert Peel. Both ministers appear to have been convinced by Collier's argument, and on 5 August, it was announced in both Houses of Parliament that Baron Platt had yielded. The subsequent argument before all the judges in London of the point taken at the trial resulted in the grant of a free pardon to Collier's clients. On his next visit to Exeter he had nineteen briefs. Local influence and wide practical knowledge gave him a good practice, and he was an excellent junior. He was appointed recorder of Penzance, and in 1852 he was returned to parliament for Plymouth, in the Liberal interest, and retained the seat till he became a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Lord Cranworth made him a Queen's Counsel in 1854. After a keen rivalry with Montague Edward Smith, afterwards a judge, for the foremost place, he obtained the lead of the circuit and kept it for many years. Vanity Fair caricature of 1870 In 1859, he was appointed counsel to the Admiralty and Judge-Advocate of the Fleet. It was his opinion in favour of detaining the Confederate rams in the Mersey that Mr Adams, the American minister, submitted in 1862 to Lord John Russell, and, although too late to prevent the CSS Alabama going to sea, it was afterwards adopted by the law officers of the Crown. He had spoken frequently and with good effect in parliament, especially on trade with Russia in 1855, but chiefly on legal topics; and when, on Sir William Atherton's retirement in October 1863, Sir Roundell Palmer became Attorney-General, Collier's appointment as Solicitor-General, (receiving the customary knighthood) in succession to him was somewhat unexpected. He filled the office, however, with success until the Liberal government resigned in 1866, and in December 1868 he became Attorney-General, and in the next year he had the conduct of the Bankruptcy Bill in the House of Commons. He was, while Attorney-General, appointed Recorder of Bristol, but resigned the appointment at once in deference to the wishes of his constituency. In 1871, to enable the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, to overtake its arrears of colonial appeals, an act was passed providing for four paid judgeships, two of which were to be held by judges or ex-judges of the English bench. To none could one of the law officers be appointed. One of these two judgeships was accepted by Sir Montague Smith. The other was offered to and refused by three English judges, and a fourth having intimated that he would refuse it if offered, Lord Hatherley, the Lord Chancellor, thought it unseemly to hawk the appointment about any further. It was imperative that the vacancy should be at once filled, and Collier agreed to relieve the government in this difficulty. To give him the necessary technical qualification, Lord Hatherley in November 1871 appointed him to a vacant puisne judgeship in the Common Pleas. Here he sat a few days only; three judgments of his are, however, reported. Though a writ was made out appointing him a serjeant, it was never executed in open court, nor was he a member of Serjeants' Inn. Then, Gladstone appointed him to the vacancy on the Privy Council. No doubt was cast either on his fitness for the place or on his personal conduct in accepting it; but a controversy, very damaging to the government, arose out of the appointment. Lord Chief Justice Cockburn and Chief Justice Bovill protested against it as contrary to the spirit of the act, and on 15 February 1872, Lord Stanhope made a motion in the House of Lords condemning it, which was lost only by two votes. A similar motion in the House of Commons was lost by only twenty-seven. Collier held this post until his death, and the task of giving literary shape to the judgments of the Privy Council was frequently committed to him. In 1885, he was created a peer, as Baron Monkswell, of Monkswell in the County of Devon, taking his title from Monkswell, a small property in Devonshire. Works He published a treatise on the Railways Clauses Acts, 1845; another on Mines in 1849; a letter to Lord John Russell on the 'Reform of the Common Law Courts,' 1851, 2nd ed. 1852; and a translation of 'Demosthenes de Coron√¢' in 1875. It was chiefly in painting, of which he was passionately fond, that he was distinguished. As a young man he drew very clever caricatures in the H.B. manner. When solicitor-general he painted in St. James's Park, and he exhibited frequently at the Royal Academy and Grosvenor Gallery, especially pictures of the neighbourhood of Rosenlaui, Switzerland, where he spent many vacations. Family Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London He married in 1844 a daughter of Mr. William Rose of Woolston Heath, near Rugby, and her sudden death in April 1886 shook him severely. In failing health he went to the Riviera, and died at Grasse, near Cannes, on 27 October 1886, and was buried in London on 3 November. His grave lies on the east side of the main path from the north entrance to the central colonnades in Brompton Cemetery in London. It is very modest in design, and despite its prominent location it is easily missed. He was succeeded by his son Robert, a barrister, who graduated in the first class of the Cambridge law tripos, 1866, and has held the post of conveyancing counsel to the treasury; his son John, was a well-known artist; and his daughter Margaret, Mme. Galettidi Cadilhac, has written ' Our Home by the Adriatic ' and 'Prince Peerless,' a fairy tale. Arms Judicial decisions R. v. Coote (1873), L.R. 4 P.C. 599, [1873] UKPC 26 (P.C.).

Jazz artist Rudy Vall√©e became what was perhaps the first complete example of the 20th century mass media pop star. Vall√©e became the most prominent and, arguably, the first of a new style of popular singer, the crooner. One of the most successful crooners was Bing Crosby. Crosby cited popular singer Al Jolson as one of his main influences. Crosby was in turn cited by Perry Como. Crosby also influenced this singing of Frank Sinatra; Crosby and Sinatra sang together in the 1956 film High Society. American pop musical examples from the 1960s include The Monkees. Pop groups like these remained popular into the 1970s, producing family acts like the Partridge Family and The Osmonds. By the late 1990s, there were numerous varieties of Teen pop including singers like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, Samantha Mumba and Clean-cut boy bands like *NSYNC, The Backstreet Boys, 98¬∞ and girl groups such as The Spice Girls and Destiny's Child.

It originated from British post-punk in the late 1970s and subsequently generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Compared to its counterpart, indie rock, the genre is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. In later years, the definition of indie pop has bifurcated to also mean bands from unrelated DIY scenes/movements with pop leanings. Subgenres include chamber pop and twee pop. Development and characteristics =Origins and etymology= Both indie and indie pop had originally referred to the same thing during the late 1970s. Inspired more by punk rock's DIY ethos than its style, guitar bands were formed on the then-novel premise that one could record and release their own music instead of having to procure a record contract from a major label. According to Emily Dolan, indie is predicated on the distorted music of the Velvet Underground, the \\"rebellious screaming\\" of early punk, and \\"some of rock's more quirky and eccentric figures\\", such as Jonathan Richman. Pitchforks Nitsuh Abebe identifies the majority of indie as \\"all about that 60s-styled guitar jangle\\". Indie pop borrows heavily from Western pop song conventions and structures with extensive use of, for example, major chords, hooks, common time and a \\"consistent and noticeable rhythmic element\\" i.e. the beat. Indie pop was an unprecedented contrast from the gritty and serious tones of previous underground rock styles, as well as being a departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music. Distinguished from the angst and abrasiveness of its indie rock counterpart, the majority of indie pop borrows not only the stripped-down quality of punk, but also \\"the sweetness and catchiness of mainstream pop\\". Music critic Simon Reynolds says that indie pop defines itself against \\"charting pop\\". Abebe explains: Despite their relatively minor commercial success (their third album was sardonically titled They Could Have Been Bigger than the Beatles), the Television Personalities are highly regarded by critics and have been widely influential, especially on the C86 generation.Buckley, Peter. The Rough Guide to Rock. Rough Guides, 2003. Simon Reynolds has said that \\"what we now know as indie music was invented in Scotland,\\" with reference to the emergence of Postcard Records in 1979. However, some have posited that concept of indie music did not crystallise until the late 1980s and early 1990s. Brisbane band \\"The Go- Betweens\\" were an early influential indie pop band, releasing their first single \\"Lee Remick\\" in 1978. American indie pop band Beat Happening's 1985 eponymous debut album was also influential in the development of the indie pop sound, particularly in North America. In the early 1990s, English indie pop influenced and branched off to a variety of styles. The US, which did not have as much of a scene in the 1980s, had many indie pop enthusiasts by the mid 1990s. Most of the modern notion of indie music stems from NMEs 1986 compilation C86, which collects many guitar bands who were inspired by the early psychedelic sounds of 1960s garage rock. Names that indie pop fans use for themselves are popkids and popgeeks, and for the music they listen to, p!o!p, twee, anorak and C86. Abebe says that the Scottish group the Pastels typified the \\"hip end of 'anorak': Their lazy melodies, lackadaisical strum, and naive attitude transformed the idea of the rock band into something casual, intimate, and free from the pretense of cool\\". =Disputed significance of C86= Everett True, a writer for NME in the 1980s, believes that C86 was not the main factor behind indie pop, arguing that Sarah Records was more responsible for sticking to a particular sound, and that: \\"C86 didn't actually exist as a sound, or style. ... I find it weird, bordering on surreal, that people are starting to use it as a description again\\". Geoff Taylor, a member of the band Age of Chance, added: \\"We never considered ourselves part of any scene. I‚Äôm not sure that the public at large did either, to be honest. We were just an independent band around at that same time as the others.\\" Bob Stanley, a Melody Maker journalist in the late 1980s and founding member of pop band Saint Etienne, acknowledges that participants at the time reacted against lazy labelling, but insists they shared an approach: \\"Of course the 'scene', like any scene, barely existed. Like squabbling Marxist factions, groups who had much in common built up petty rivalries. The June Brides and the Jasmine Minks were the biggest names at Alan McGee's Living Room Club and couldn't stand the sight of each other. Only when the Jesus and Mary Chain exploded and stole their two-headed crown did they realise they were basically soulmates.Bob Stanley, sleevenotes to CD86 Manic Street Preachers bassist Nicky Wire remembers that it was the bands' very independence that gave the scene coherence: \\"People were doing everything themselves - making their own records, doing the artwork, gluing the sleeves together, releasing them and sending them out, writing fanzines because the music press lost interest really quickly.\\" Many of the actual C86 bands distanced themselves from the scene cultivated around them by the UK music press - in its time, C86 became a pejorative term for its associations with so-called \\"shambling\\" (a John Peel-coined description celebrating the self- conscious primitive approach of some of the music) and underachievement. Related genres =Twee pop= Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that originates from C86. Characterised by its simplicity and perceived innocence, some of its defining features are boy-girl harmonies, catchy melodies, and lyrics about love. For many years, most bands were distributed by Sarah Records (in the UK) and K Records (in the US). =Shibuya-kei= Shibuya-kei is a Japanese style from the 1990s that was embraced by indie pop enthusiasts, partly because many of its bands were distributed in the United States through major indie labels like Matador and Grand Royal. Out of all the Japanese groups from the scene, Pizzicato Five was the closest in achieving mainstream success in the US. =Chamber pop= Chamber pop is a subgenre of indie pop that features lush orchestrations. Heavily influenced by Brian Wilson and Burt Bacharach, the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for √©l Records embodied the sophisticated use of orchestras and voices that typified the style.
