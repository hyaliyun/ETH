The venue was reopened by Chuck Terzella in October 1983, with management by Frank Gallagher and the English DJ Andy Dunkley, presenting reggae and other ethnic music, plus college rock, proclaiming in their ads \\"We don't have video\\". Terzella's club filed for bankruptcy in December 1985, and closed in June 1986. Chris Williamson, who already promoted the punk and hard rock oriented \\"Rock Hotel\\" nights at the Ritz, then took over in November 1986.Poster for Sonic Youth show November 22, 1986 He began programming alternative rock occasionally using the designation \\"Rock Motel\\".

They had to spend $25,000 on bringing the venue up to firecode before, in April 1987, Chris Williamson re-opened the club, featuring improved sound and lights, with an inaugural multi-night stand of Big Audio Dynamite. Williamson continued putting on shows into 1988‚Äîincluding hosting the popular \\"Milky Way\\" hip hop nights‚Äîbut, as Irving Place gentrified, there was increasing local opposition to the hall. A plan by Williamson to present a play in the winter of 1988 fell through and, in December 1988, it was announced that the club would close and be demolished and turned into condos. The last show was The Ramones on December 31, 1988. Dee Dee Ramone praised the venue: \\"It was funky without being a dump.\\" Ron Delsener took on management in the early 1990s. Live Nation, a spinoff of Clear Channel Communications, renovated and reopened Irving Plaza under the name \\"Fillmore New York At Irving Plaza\\" on April 11, 2007, reviving the name of the former Fillmore East in Manhattan's East Village, which had been open from 1968 to 1971. However, in May 2010 Live Nation conceded that the new name had not caught on and due to \\"unrelenting demand\\" the name \\"Irving Plaza\\" would be restored as from June 23, 2010. A replica of the original marquee has been commissioned. In September 2010, Irving Plaza became the venue for the services of Hillsong Church New York.hillsongnyc.com On February 14, 2015, Paul McCartney played a surprise show announced only that morning on Twitter.

A 4-Digit MAJCOM wing, they were considered as temporary, provisional units. Beginning in 1962, in order to retain the lineage of the Strategic Wings as combat units and to perpetuate the lineage of many currently inactive bombardment units with illustrious World War II records, Headquarters SAC received authority from Headquarters USAF to discontinue its MAJCOM strategic wings that were equipped with combat aircraft and to activate AFCON units, most of which were inactive at the time which could carry a lineage and history. Component units were also redesignated to historically-linked units of the newly established wing.

Matthew Slotover (born 1968) is an English publisher and entrepreneur. He is co-founder of Frieze, a media and events company, which now includes the Frieze Art Fair, frieze and Frieze Academy. Life and career Slotover attended St Paul's School, London and then went on to Oxford University. He first became interested in contemporary art after visiting the YBA art exhibition Modern Medicine, in 1990. Slotover's father, Robert Slotover manages classical musicians including the composer Sir Harrison Birtwistle; his mother Jill Slotover is a children's book editor. Matthew's maternal grandfather, Richard Kravitz was an American magazine publisher who introduced Esquire and DC Comics to the UK.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+FAIR+GAME%3B+In+two+weeks,+the+key+players+in+the+contemporary+art...-a0137282339 Slotover launched Frieze in June 1991 with Tom Gidley as co-editor. The pilot issue featured the first ever magazine interview with Damien Hirst, with a detail of a Hirst butterfly painting on the cover. Amanda Sharp joined Frieze in July 1991. In 1999, he founded Counter Editions, a low-cost, high-volume edition company, with Carl Freedman and Neville Wakefield. Slotover is chair of the South London Gallery board of trustees. In 2000, he was a judge on the Turner Prize. And in 1993, he curated a section of the Aperto at the Venice Biennale, which included Damien Hirst, Mat Collishaw and Rirkrit Tiravanija. Through Frieze, Slotover has published the books: What the Butler Saw - The Selected Writings of Stuart Morgan; All Tomorrow's Parties - Photographs of Andy Warhol‚Äôs Factory, by Billy Name; and Designed by Peter Saville, a retrospective of Saville's graphic design. In 2009, Slotover received an honorary degree from University of the Arts London. In 2010, Slotover debated whether \\"art fairs are about money\\" with Louisa Buck, Matthew Collings, and Jasper Joffe for the motion and against the motion Norman Rosenthal, Richard Wentworth, Matthew Slotover. Joffe claims that his criticisms of Frieze Art Fair led to his work being banned from the fair in 2010. Frieze replied that Resonance FM had hung a number of works, including Joffe's, against their agreement with the fair, and that to ensure a high quality level, artworks in the fair are included only via the galleries in the fair who are selected by the selection committee. In May 2011, Slotover and Sharp announced the launch of two new art fairs - Frieze New York, and Frieze Masters. In 2010, Slotover and Sharp were placed jointly at number 41 in the ArtReview \\"Power 100\\", a list of influential people in fine arts. Slotover and Sharp were both appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to the visual arts.

He was director of the Natural History Museum, London, president of the Linnean Society of London, and a winner of the Royal Society's Darwin Medal for his studies on evolution. Biography Born on 1 November 1899 in Malden, Surrey (now part of London), de Beer spent most of his childhood in France, where he was educated at the Parisian √âcole Pascal. During this time, he also visited Switzerland, a country with which he remained fascinated for the rest of his life. His education continued at Harrow and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he graduated with a degree in zoology in 1921, after a pause to serve in the First World War in the Grenadier Guards and the Army Education Corps. He soon became a fellow of Merton College, Oxford and began to teach at the university's zoology department. In 1938, he was made reader in embryology at University College, London. During the Second World War De Beer again served with the Grenadier Guards reaching the rank of temporary lieutenant colonel. He worked in intelligence, propaganda and psychological warfare. Also during the war, in 1940, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1945, de Beer became professor of zoology and was, from 1946 to 1949, president of the Linnean Society. Then he was director of the British Museum (Natural History) (now the Natural History Museum), from 1950 until his retirement in 1960. He was knighted in 1954, and awarded the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1957. After his retirement, de Beer moved to Switzerland and worked on several publications on Charles Darwin and his own seminal Atlas of Evolution. He also wrote a series of books about Switzerland and the Alps. De Beer returned to England in 1971 and died at Alfriston, Sussex on 21 June 1972. Work De Beer's early work at Oxford was influenced by J. B. S. Haldane and by Julian Huxley and E. S. Goodrich (two of his teachers). His early work was in experimental embryology; some of it was done in collaboration with Huxley, who would go on to be one of the leading figures of the modern synthesis. The Elements of experimental embryology, written with Huxley, was the best summary of the field at that time (1934). In Embryos and Ancestors (1930) de Beer stressed the importance of heterochrony, and especially paedomorphosis in evolution. According to his theories, paedomorphosis (the retention of juvenile features in the adult form) is more important in evolution than gerontomorphosis, since juvenile tissues are relatively undifferentiated and capable of further evolution, whereas highly specialised tissues are less able to change. He also conceived the idea of clandestine evolution, which helped to explain the sudden changes in the fossil record which were apparently at odds with Darwin's gradualist theory of evolution. If a novelty were to evolve gradually in an animal's juvenile form, then its development would not appear in the fossil record at all, but if the species were then to undergo neoteny (a form of paedomorphosis in which sexual maturity is reached while in an otherwise juvenile form), then the feature would appear suddenly in the fossil record, despite having evolved gradually. De Beer worked on paleornithology and general evolutionary theory, and was largely responsible for elucidating the concept of mosaic evolution, as illustrated by his review of Archaeopteryx in 1954. De Beer's also reviewed Haeckel's concept of heterochrony, with particular emphasis on its role in avian evolution, especially that of the ratites, in 1956. Dedicated to the popularisation of science, he received the Kalinga Prize from UNESCO. De Beer was the first to propose the Col de la Traversette as the likely site where Hannibal had crossed the Alps with his elephants. His thesis received support in 2016 when Mahaney et al. reported that sediments had been identified at the pass that had been churned up by \\"the constant movement of thousands of animals and humans\\" and dated them to the time of Hannibal's invasion.  De Beer and the modern synthesis  The conventional view had been that developmental biology had little influence on the modern synthesis, but the following assessment suggests otherwise, at least as far as de Beer is concerned: In his 1971 work \\"Homology: An Unsolved Problem\\", de Beer summarized that: \\"It is now clear that the pride with which it was assumed that the inheritance of homologous structures from a common ancestor explained homology was misplaced; for such inheritance cannot be ascribed to identity of genes. The attempt to find 'homologous' genes, except in closely related species, has been given up as hopeless.\\" Works *Comparative, Embryology And Evolution Of Chordate Animals (1922) *Growth ‚Äì 1924 *An introduction to experimental embryology ‚Äì 1926 *The comparative anatomy, histology and development of the pituitary body ‚Äì 1926 *Vertebrate Zoology ‚Äì 1928 *Early travellers in the Alps ‚Äì 1930 *Embryology and evolution ‚Äì 1930 (later editions bore the title Embryos and ancestors) *Alps and men.

A total of 40 episodes were made, all but one of them being believed to have aired. It was originally made by ABC Television for the ITV network, with its production being continued by Thames Television. Plot The plots revolved around two tailors in business together. Manny Cohen, played by John Bluthal, was Jewish, and Patrick Kelly, played by Joe Lynch, was Irish Catholic. Above their shop worked Lewtas (Bernard Spear) who was also Jewish and imported cloth. Two further prominent characters were Rabbi Levy (Christopher Benjamin in the pilot (he later reappeared as Dr Shapiro in a later episode), Cyril Shaps in series 1 to 4, David Nettheim and Jonathan Burn as Rabbi Stone in series 5) from the local synagogue, and Father Ryan (Denis Carey in the pilot, Eamon Kelly in series 1 to 4) from the local Catholic church. The Romanian-born Meier Tzelniker also made several appearances as Israel Bloom. One episode featured Manny and Patrick trading the rights to display their pictures around the shop. When Patrick had two pictures of the Pope on the wall while Manny had one of Moshe Dayan, Manny's comment was \\"It's the going rate. Two Popes to one Moshe.\\" Another episode had Patrick, a singer, filling in at the synagogue for a sick cantor, on the occasion of a visit by the Chief Rabbi. Coached to sing phonetically in Hebrew, Patrick performs, every moment milked for comedic value. Finally, the Chief Rabbi congratulates Patrick but reveals he knows something is up. When asked how he knows, he replies, \\"Simple. At the end of the service you genuflected and crossed yourself!\\" The episode title was \\"The Not-So-Kosher Cantor\\". Notable guest artistes included film actors Dennis Price as a Savile Row tailor and Rupert Davies as a Roman Catholic bishop, Fred Emney, Harold Bennett, David Kossoff (playing himself), Jack Smethurst, Dad's Army stars Frank Williams (playing another clergyman) and Bill Pertwee, comedian Dick Bentley, Roy Marsden, Victor Maddern, future Coronation Street stars Barbara Knox (as Barbara Mullaney) and Roy Barraclough, George A. Cooper, Rita Webb, On the Buses star Michael Robbins, and Ellen Pollock as Manny's mother Ruby. Film adaptation In 1973, Bluthal and Lynch reprised their roles in a film spin off. Episodes The pilot and the first two series were produced by ABC; however, the second series (of 6 episodes) did not air until just after Thames launched, who initially aired the six series 2 episodes over August and September 1968. Out of the 40 episodes which were made, 11 episodes no longer exist. These are the pilot, five of the six episodes from Series 1, and five of the six episodes from Series 2.

As the patron saint of the Vijayanagara Empire, Vyasatirtha was at the forefront of a golden age in Dvaita which saw new developments in dialectical thought, growth of the Haridasa literature under bards like Purandara Dasa and Kanaka Dasa and an amplified spread of Dvaita across the subcontinent. Three of his polemically themed doxographical works Nyayamruta, Tatparya Chandrika and Tarka Tandava (collectively called Vyasa Traya) documented and critiqued an encyclopaedic range of sub-philosophies in Advaita, Visistadvaita, Mahayana Buddhism, Mimamsa and Nyaya, revealing internal contradictions and fallacies. His Nyayamruta caused a significant stir in the Advaita community across the country requiring a rebuttal by Madhusudhana Saraswati through his text, Advaitasiddhi. Born into a Brahmin family as Yatiraja, Bramhanya Tirtha, the pontiff of the matha at Abbur, assumed guardianship over him and oversaw his education. He studied the six orthodox schools of Hinduism at Kanchi and subsequently, the philosophy of Dvaita under Sripadaraja at Mulbagal, eventually succeeding him as the pontiff. He served as a spiritual adviser to Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya at Chandragiri though his most notable association was with the Tuluva king Krishna Deva Raya. With the royal patronage of the latter, Vyasatirtha undertook a massive expansion of Dvaita into the scholarly circles, through his polemical tracts as well as into the lives of the laymen through devotional songs and poems. In this regard, he penned several kirtanas under the nom de plume of Krishna including the classical Carnatic song Krishna Ni Begane Baaro. Politically, Vyasatirtha was responsible for the development of irrigation systems in villages such as Bettakonda and establishment of several Vayu temples in the newly conquered regions between Bengaluru and Mysore in-order to quell any rebellion and facilitate their integration into the Empire. For his contribution to the Dvaita school of thought, he, along with Madhva and Jayatirtha, are considered to be the three great saints of Dvaita (munitraya). Scholar Surendranath Dasgupta notes, \\"The logical skill and depth of acute dialectical thinking shown by Vyasa-tirtha stands almost unrivalled in the whole field of Indian thought\\".  Historical Sources  Information about Vyasatirtha is derived from his biography by the poet Somanatha Kavi called Vyasayogicharita and inscriptional evidence. Songs of Purandara Dasa and traditional stories yield important insights too. Though Vyasayogicharita is a hagiography, unlike other works in the genre, it is free of embellishments such as performance of miracles and some of its claims can be corroborated with inscriptional evidence. Somanatha mentions at the end of the text that the biography was approved by Vyasatirtha himself, implying the contemporary nature of the work. While some scholars attest the veracity of the text to the claim that Somanatha was a Smartha hence free of sectarian bias, others question the claim citing a lack of evidence.  Context  The philosophy of Dvaita or Tattvavada was an obscure movement within Vedanta in medieval India. Philosophically, its tenets stood in direct opposition to Advaita in that its progenitor, Madhva, postulated that the self (Atman) and god (Brahman) are distinct and that the world is real. As Advaita was the prevailing sub-sect of Vedanta at the time, the works of Madhva and his followers came under significant attack and ridicule. Madhva deployed his disciples to promulgate the philosophy across the country, which led to the establishment of a small and diffuse network of mathas, or centres of worship, across the subcontinent. The early years of Dvaita were spent spreading its basic tenets including participating in debates with the Advaita scholars. Philosophical improvements were pioneered by Padmanabha Tirtha and subsequently perfected by Jayatirtha. Dasgupta contends that the latter's contributions brought Dvaita up to the standards of intellectual sophistication set by Advaita and Visistadvaita. By imbuing the nascent philosophy with structure and expanding upon Madhva's terse texts, he reinforced the intellectual position of Madhva and set the standard for Dvaita literature through his seminal work, Nyaya Sudha ('Nectar of Logic'). Subsequent authors such as Vishnudasacharya further expanded upon these texts and authored commentaries branching into diverse fields such as Mimamsa and Navya Nyaya, a tradition which would continue for centuries. Despite the intellectual growth, due to the turbulent political atmosphere of India at the time, penetration of Dvaita into the cultural collective of the subcontinent was limited. It was not until Sripadaraja, the pontiff of the matha at Abbur, who aligned himself with the Vijaynagara king Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya and served as his guru, that Dvaita would receive royal encouragement and a certain degree of power. But the Smartha Brahmins, adhering to the principles of Advaita, and Sri Vaishnavites, following the Visistadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja, controlled the Shiva and Vishnu temples respectively, thus limiting the influence of Dvaita.  Early life  A vision of Vishnu urged Vyasatirtha to return to the monastery and accept the monastic order. Vyasatirtha was born Yatiraja into a Deshastha Madhva Brahmin family to Ballanna and Akkamma in a hamlet called Bannur. According to Vyasayogicharita, the childless couple approached saint Bramhanya Tirtha, who granted them a boon of three children with the condition that the second child, who would turn out to be Yatiraja, be handed over to him. After Yatiraja's upanayana, Bramhanya Tirtha assumed guardianship over the child. Bramhanya was genuinely surprised by the precocious intellect of the child and intended to ordain him as a monk. Yatiraja, anticipating the ordination, decided to run away from the hermitage. While resting under a tree, he had a vision of Vishnu, who urged Yatiraja to return, which he did. He was subsequently ordained as Vyasatirtha. Indologist B.N.K Sharma contends that Vyasatirtha would have been 16 years of age at this time. After the death of Bramhanya Tirtha during the famine of 1475‚Äì1476, Vyasatirtha succeeded him as the pontiff of the matha at Abbur and proceeded to Kanchi, which was the centre for Sastric learning in South India at the time, to educate himself on the six orthodox schools of thought, which are: Vedanta, Samkhya, Nyaya, Mimamsa, Vaisheshika and Yoga. Sharma conjectures that the education Vyasatirtha received in Kanchi helped him become erudite in the intricacies and subtleties of Advaita, Visistadvaita, Navya Nyaya and other schools of thought. After completing his education at Kanchi, Vyasatirtha headed to Mulbagal to study the philosophy of Dvaita under Sripadaraja, whom he would consider his guru, for a period of five to six years. He was subsequently sent to the Vijayanagara court of Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya at the behest of Sripadaraja.  At Chandragiri  Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala. Vyasatirtha was received by Saluva Narasimha at Chandragiri. Somanatha speaks of several debates and discussions in which Vyasatirtha emerged triumphant over the leading scholars of the day. He also talks about Vyasatirtha giving spiritual guidance to the king. Around the same time, Vyasatirtha was entrusted with the worship of the Venkateshwara idol at Tirupati and undertook his first South Indian tour (a tour entailing travelling to different regions in order to spread the doctrines of Dvaita). After the death of Saluva Narasimha, Vyasatirtha remained at Chandragiri in the court of Narasimha Raya II until Tuluva Narasa Nayaka declared himself to be the de facto ruler of Vijayanagara. At the behest of Narasa, Vyasatirtha moved to Hampi and would remain there for the rest of his life. After the death of Narasa, his son Viranarasimha Raya was subsequently crowned. Some scholars argue against the claim that Vyasatirtha acted as a spiritual adviser to Saluva Narasimha, Narasimha II and Vira Narasimha due to the lack of inscriptional evidence.  At Hampi  Vyasatirtha maintained cordial relationships with the royalty, especially Krishnadevaraya, who considered Vyasatirtha as his guru. At Hampi, the new capital of the empire, Vyasatirtha was appointed as the \\"Guardian Saint of the State\\" after a period of prolonged disputations and debates with scholars led by Basava Bhatta, an emissary from the Kingdom of Kalinga. His association with the royalty continued after Viranarasimha Raya overthrew Narasimha Raya II to become the emperor. Fern√£o Nunes observes that \\"The King of Bisnega, everyday, hears the teachings of a learned Brahmin who never married nor ever touched a woman\\" which Sharma conjectures is Vyasatirtha. Sharma also contends that it was around this time that Vyasatirtha had begun his work on Tatparya Chandrika, Nyayamruta and Tarka Tandva. After the accession of Krishnadeva Raya, Vyasatirtha, who the king regarded as his kuladevata, greatly expanded his influence by serving as an emissary and diplomat to the neighbouring kingdoms while simultaneously disseminating the philosophy of Dvaita into the subcontinent. His close relationship to Krishnadeva Raya is corroborated by inscriptions on the Vitthala Temple at Hampi and accounts by the Portuguese traveler Domingo Paes. Vyasatirtha was also sent on diplomatic missions to the Bijapur Sultante and accepted grants of villages in newly conquered territories for the establishment of Mathas. Stoker conjectures that this was advantageous to both the king and Vyasatirtha as the establishments of mathas in these newly conquered regions led to political stability and also furthered the reach of Dvaita. Somanatha writes of an incident where Krishnadeva Raya was sent a work of criticism against Dvaita by an Advaita scholar in Kalinga as a challenge. After Vyasatirtha retaliated accordingly, Krishnadeva Raya awarded Vyasatirtha with a ratnabhisheka (a shower of jewels) which Vyasatirtha subsequently distributed among the poor. The inscriptions speak of grants of villages to Vyasatirtha from Krishnadeva Raya around this period, including Bettakonda, where he developed large irrigation systems including a lake called Vyasasamudra. This period of Vyasatirtha also saw the establishment of Dasakuta (translated as community of devotees), a forum where people gathered and sung hymns and devotional songs. The forum attracted a number of wandering bards (called Haridasas or devotees of Vishnu) such as Purandara Dasa and Kanaka Dasa.  Later Years  In his later years, Vyasatirtha donated a Narasimha idol to the Vittala Temple indicating his continued participation in the temple affairs. There was a period of \\"temporary estrangement\\" from the royalty due to internal political friction, during which Vyasatirtha retreated to Bettakonda. After the death of Krishnadeva Raya, Vyasatirtha continued to advise Achyuta Deva Raya. Inscriptions speak of his donation of a Narasimha idol to the Vittala Temple at Hampi indicating he was still an active figure. His disciples Vijayendra Tirtha and Vadiraja Tirtha furthered his legacy by penning polemical works and spreading the philosophy of Dvaita into the Chola and the Malnad region, eventually assuming pontifical seats at Kumbakonam and Sodhe, respectively. He died in 1539 and his mortal remains are enshrined in Nava Brindavana, near Hampi. His remembrance day every year (called Aradhana) is celebrated in the month of Phalguna. He was succeeded by his disciple, Srinivasa Tirtha. The tomb or Brindavana of Vyasatirtha in Anegundi.  Works  Vyasatirtha authored eight works consisting of polemical tracts, commentaries on the works of Madhva and a few hymns. Visnudasacharya's Vadaratnavali, a polemical treatise against the tenets of Advaita, is considered to have significant influenced him. By tracing a detailed, sophisticated and historically sensitive evolution of systems of thought such as Advaita, Vyakarana, Nyaya and Mimamsa and revealing internal inconsistencies, McCrea contends that Vyasatirtha created a new form of doxography. Ramanuja's Visistadvaita as well as Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka is dealt with in Nyayamruta. This style of polemics influenced Appayya Dikshita, who authored his own doxographical work titled ≈öƒÅtrasiddhƒÅntale≈õasa·πÉgraha.  Nyayamruta  Nyayamruta is a polemical and expositional work in four chapters. Advaita assumes that the world and its multiplicity is the result of the interaction between Maya (sometimes also characterized as avidya or ignorance) and the Brahman. Therefore, according to Advaita, the world is nothing more than an illusory construct. The definition of this falsity of the world (called mithyatva) varies within Advaita with some opining that the world has various degrees of reality for example Appayya Dikshita assumes three degrees, while Madhusudhana Saraswati assumes two. The first chapter of Nyayamruta refutes these definitions of reality. In the second chapter, Vyasatirtha examines role of pramanas in Dvaita and Advaita. Pramana translates to \\"proof\\" or \\"means of knowing\\". Dvaita assumes the validity of three pramanas: pratyeksha (direct experience), anumana (inference) and sabda (agama). Here, Vyasatirtha argues that the principles of Dvaita can be supported by the relevant pramanas and demonstrates this by verifying Madhva's doctrine of five fold difference accordingly. Subsequently, the Advaita concept of Nirguna Brahman is argued against. While the third deals with the critique of the Advaita view on the attainment of true knowledge (jnana), the fourth argues against soteriological issues in Advaita like Moksha, specifically dealing with the concept of Jivanmukti (enlightenment while alive). Vyasatirtha asks whether, for an Advaitin, the body ceases to exist after the veil of illusion has been lifted and the unity with the Brahman has been attained. Nyayamruta caused a furore in the Advaita community resulting in a series of scholarly debates over centuries. Madhusudhana Saraswati, a scholar from Varanasi, composed a line-by-line refutation of Nyayamruta titled Advaitasiddhi. In response, Ramacharya rebutted with Nyayamruta Tarangini and Anandabhattaraka with Nyayamruta Kantakoddhara. The former is criticised by Brahmananda Saraswati in his commentary on Advaitasiddhi, Guruchandrika. Vanamali Mishra composed a refutation of the Bramhananda Saraswati's work and the controversy eventually died down. Stoker conjectures that the strong responses Vyasatirtha received were due to the waning power of Advaita in the Vijayanagara empire coupled by the fact that as an administrator of the mathas, Vyasatirtha enjoyed royal patronage. Vyasatirtha's disciple Vijayendra Tirtha has authored a commentary on the Nyayamruta called Laghu Amoda.  Tatparya Chandrika  Tatparya Chandrika or Chandrika is a commentary on Tattva Prakasika by Jayatirtha, which in turn is a commentary on Madhva's Brahma Sutra Bhashya (which is a bhashya or a commentary on Badarayana's Brahma Sutra). It not only documents and analyses the commentaries of Shankara, Madhva and Ramanuja on the Brahma Sutra but also their respective sub-commentaries. The goal of Vyasatirtha here is to prove the supremacy of Madhva's Brahma Sutra Bhashya by showing it to be in harmony with the original source, more so than the other commentaries. The doxographical style of Vyasatirtha is evident in his copious quotations from the main commentaries (of Advaita and Visistadvaita) and their respective sub-commentaries under every adhikarna or chapter. Only the first two chapters of the Brahma Sutra are covered. The rest was completed by Raghunatha Tirtha in the 18th century.  Tarka Tandava  Tarka Tandava or \\"The Dance of Logic\\" is a polemical tract targeted towards the Nyaya school. Though Vyasatirtha and his predecessors borrowed the technical language, logical tools and terminologies from the Nyaya school of thought and there is much in common between the two schools, there were significant differences especially with regards to epistemology. Jayatirtha's Nyaya Sudha and Pramana Paddhati were the first reactions against the Nyaya school. The advent of Navya Nyaya widened the differences between the two schools especially related to the acquisition of knowledge or pramanas, triggering a systematic response from Vyasatirtha through Tarka Tandava. Vyasatirtha refers to and critiques standard as well as contemporary works of Nyaya: Gangesha Upadhyaya's Tattvachintamani, Nyayalilavati by Sri Vallabha and Udayana's Kusumanjali and their commentaries. The work is divided into three chapters corresponding to the three pramanas, and a number of topics are raised, including a controversial claim arguing for the supremacy of the conclusion (upasamhara) as opposed to the opening statement (upakrama) of the Brahma Sutra. Purva Mimamsa and Advaita adhere to the theory that the opening statement trumps the conclusion and base their assumptions accordingly. Vyasatirtha's claim put him at odds with the Vedanta community with Appayya Dikshita being his most vocal opponent. Vyasatirtha's claim was defended by Vijayendra Tirtha in Upasamhara Vijaya.  Mandara Manjari  Mandara Manjari is the collective name given to Vyasatirtha's glosses on three (Mayavada Khandana, Upadhi Khandana, Prapancha Mithyavada Khandana) out of Madhva's ten refutation treatises called Dasha Prakarna and one on Tattvaviveka of Jayatirtha. Vyasatirtha here expands only on the obscure passages in the source text.  Bhedojjivana  Bhedojjivana is the last work of Vyasatirtha as it quotes from his previous works. The main focus of this treatise is to emphasise the doctrine of difference (Bheda) in Dvaita as is evident from the title, which can be translated to \\"Resuscitation of Bheda\\". Sarma notes \\"Within a short compass, he has covered the ground of the entire Monistic literature pushed into contemporary prominence and argued an unexpurgated case for the Realism of Madhva\\".  Legacy  Vyasatirtha is considered to be one of the foremost philosophers of Dvaita thought, along with Jayatirtha and Madhva, for his philosophical and dialectical thought, his role in spreading the school of Dvaita across the subcontinent and his support to the Haridasa movement. Sharma writes \\"we find in his works a profoundly wide knowledge of ancient and contemporary systems of thought and an astonishingly brilliant intellect coupled with rare clarity and incisiveness of thought and expression\\". His role as an adviser and guide to the Vijayanagara emperors, especially Krishna Devaraya, has been notable as well.  Spread of Dvaita  Hampi became the center of Dvaita under Vyasatirtha. Sharma credits Vyasatirtha of converting Dvaita from an obscure movement to a fully realised school of thought of philosophical and dialectical merit. Through his involvement in various diplomatic missions in the North Karnataka region and his pilgrimages across South India, he disseminated the precepts of Dvaita across the sub-continent. By giving patronage to the wandering bards or Haridasas, he oversaw the percolation of the philosophy into the vernacular and as a result into the lives of the lay people. He also contributed to the spread of Dvaita by establishing several Vayu idols across Karnataka. Vyasatirtha is also considered a major influence on the then burgeoning Chaitanya movement in modern-day Bengal. Stoker postulates that his polemics against the rival schools of thought also had the effect of securing royal patronage towards Dvaita.  Scholarly Influence  Vyasatirtha was significantly influenced by his predecessors such as Vishnudasacharya, Jayatirtha and Madhva in that he borrowed from their style and method of enquiry. He exerted considerable influence on his successors. Vadiraja's Yuktimalika derives some of its arguments from Nyayamruta, while subsequent philosophers like Vijayendra Tirtha and Raghavendra have authored several commentaries on the works of Vyasatirtha. Vijayadhwaja Tirtha's Padaratnavali, an exhaustive commentary on the Madhva's Bhagvata Tatparya Nirnaya, borrows some its aspects from Vyasatirtha's oeuvre. His influence outside the Dvaita community is found in the works of Appayya, who adopted his doxographical style in some of his works and in the works of Jiva Goswami. In his dialectics, Vyasatirtha incorporated elements from such diverse schools as Purva Mimamsa, Vyakarana and Navya Nyaya. His criticism of Advaita and Nyaya led to a severe scholarly controversy, generating a series of exchanges between these schools of thought, and led to reformulations of the philosophical definitions of the respective schools. Bagchi notes \\"It must be recognised that Vyasatirtha's definition of reasoning and his exposition of its nature and service really register a high watermark in the logical speculations of India and they ought to be accepted as a distinct improvement upon the theories of Nyaya-Vaisesika school\\".  Contributions to the Haridasa Movement  The contribution of Vyasatirtha to the Haridasa cult is two fold: he established a forum of interactions for these bards called Dasakuta and he himself penned several hymns in the vernacular language (Kannada) under the pen name Krishna, most notable of those being the classical Carnatic song Krishna Ni Begane Baaro. Vyasatirtha was also the initiator of social change within the Dvaita order by inducting wandering bards into the mainstream Dvaita movement regardless of caste or creed. This is evident in his initiation of Kanaka Dasa , who was not a Brahmin and Purandara Dasa who was a merchant.  Political influence  The political influence of Vyasatirtha came into view after the discovery of Vasyayogicharita. The court of Vijayanagara was selective in its patronage thereby creating competition between the sectarian groups. Stoker contends that Vyasatirtha, cognizant of the power of Smartha and the Sri Vaishnava Brahmins in the court, targeted them through his polemical works. Though his works targeted the philosophy of Ramanuja, Vyasatirtha maintained a cordial relationship towards the Sri Vaishnavites, often donating land and money to their temples. In his role as a diplomat, he interacted with a variety of people including tribal leaders, foreign dignitaries and emissaries from the North India. By establishing mathas and shrines across the subcontinent, patronizing large scale irrigation projects at strategic locations and forging productive relationship across various social groups, he not only furthered the reach of Vaishnavism but smoothed the integration of newly conquered or rebellious territories into the empire. In doing so, he exported the Madhva iconography, doctrines and rituals into the Telugu and Tamil speaking regions of the empire. The establishment of Madhva Mathas, apart from serving as a place of worship and community, led to fostering of economic connections as they also served centers of trade and redistribution of wealth.

Boyd was a novelist, memoirist and poet who spent most of his life after World War I in Europe, primarily Britain. His work drew heavily on his own life and family, with his novels frequently exploring the experiences of the Anglo-Australian upper and middle classes. His writing was also deeply influenced by his experience of serving in World War One.

He was sensitive and private; a complex man who struggled with his identity as an Anglo-Australian, as an expatriate writer and with religious beliefs. He did not believe in the class superiority which many of his critics levelled at him; was a loyal family man and friend, yet never found a lasting romantic relationship of his own. As a writer he wrote from experience and about what he knew intimately but was never sure about himself. Throughout his life he felt like an outsider whether in Australia or Europe. Childhood and education Martin √† Beckett Boyd was born in Lucerne, Switzerland, on 10 June 1893. He was the youngest son of Arthur Merric Boyd (1862-1940) and Emma Minnie √† Beckett (1858-1936) who were both established painters. At the time of his birth, the family was travelling through Europe, supported financially by his maternal grandmother, Emma √† Beckett, wife to William Arthur Callendar √† Beckett. It was Emma's fortune, inherited from her father, John Mills, an ex-convict who founded the Melbourne Brewery, that allowed their family to live comfortably. He regarded this \\"somewhat casual birthplace as one of the factors accounting for his lifelong inability ever to feel completely at home anywhere.\\"Bardwell, Michael. \\"Divided Novelist: Martin Boyd (1893-1972)\\". London Magazine. 35, 1-2, 1995, 70-76. Print. Boyd lived in the Melbourne suburb of Sandringham until he was 13 when the family moved permanently to the family farm in , Victoria. He had a love of books and writing from an early age, but he was also colour blind. He became the only writer in his ancient family amongst painters and artists. Brenda Niall, Boyd's biographer, comments, \\"His family seems to have been one of those so distinctive in character and achievement that it confers its own citizenship. Being a Boyd was more important than being an Australian: it gave him a sense of identity strong enough to bypass nationalism for civilization.\\" Boyd's siblings included the potter William Merric Boyd (1888‚Äì1959), and the painters Theodore Penleigh Boyd (1890‚Äì1923) and Helen √† Beckett Read (1903‚Äì1999). He fondly remembered his childhood years at Yarra Glen. \\"[T]he Yarra, only yards away, still provides summer swimming as it did for the Boyds. The river yields cold eels that writhe and bite like snakes but make nice eating later. On the farm the Boyds had ponies, hunting, and fishing, and gorged themselves in the evenings on unlimited fruit and cream.\\"Kinross Smith, Graeme. \\"Martin Boyd.\\" Westerly. 2, 1975, 33-37. He enjoyed his school years at Trinity Grammar School, Kew. Niall notes that \\"Boyd did respectably in academic work; he edited the school magazine, the Mitre; he developed a love of English poetry; and, through [his headmaster's] example, he began to consider a future as a clergyman.\\" After finishing school in 1912, Boyd was undecided on a career path and so commenced study for a religious vocation at St John‚Äôs College, St Kilda. He did not see out the year but this was the beginning of a lifelong, but never resolved, investigation of the place of religious devotion in his life. At the suggestion of his mother, he began training as an architect at Purchas and Teague in Melbourne. War experiences Initially feeling no pressure to enlist, Boyd eventually signed up after hearing that some of his contemporaries at Trinity Grammar had died during the landing at Gallipoli. On the advice of his family, who thought he might not survive the rigours expected of an ordinary Australian soldier, he travelled to England and in 1916 took up a position as a commissioned officer in the Royal East Kent Regiment, known as the \\"Buffs\\". After fighting in the trenches in France for several months during 1916 and 1917, Boyd requested a transfer and was accepted into the Royal Flying Corps in 1917 where he stayed until the end of the World War I. His war experiences coloured the rest of his life, including his writing. In the 1940s Boyd questioned following Britain into World War Two believing that Australia should look to America and Mediterranean countries for replacement ties. Even though he had served in the military, he felt a strong sense of injustice at the bombing of German cities and the killing of innocent women and children, and questioned the complicity of the Church of England in the atrocities during that time. Michael Bardwell notes that Boyd was \\"a great campaigner [...] often writing letters to the press about matters he thought were of public importance.\\" A wartime example of this activism was an incident in December 1943, which Boyd relates in his autobiography Day of my Delight, quoted by Bardwell: \\"A group of eminent people had drawn up a petition to end by mutual agreement the night bombing of cities, which had now become senseless massacres. I put one of the printed forms of this petition on the village notice board, and one on my gate, saying it could be signed at my house. The notices were torn off at night. . .I then put up another inscribed: \\"The object of this petition is to stop the murder of women and children. Will those who think this aim undesirable, please come in and explain why, instead of tearing this notice off under cover of darkness?\\" No one came, and a farmer‚Äôs wife in the village said: \\"It is a pity Mr. Boyd put up those notices. It quite spoiled the Christmas spirit.\\" While Boyd did not see himself as a pacifist (he described his belief as 'qualified pacifism',Boyd, Martin. Day of my Delight, Melbourne: Landsdowne Press, 1965. he supported those who did. Throughout the years his consistent opposition to war included the publication of a seven-part protest pamphlet during the war in Vietnam entitled Why They Walk Out (1970). Extracts of the essay were published in Australia. Life after World War One Boyd returned to Australia after World War One but found he no longer fitted in. Because of his decision to join the British Army, he felt that a wedge had developed between him and his friends as their wartime experiences were different. Listless and directionless he left Melbourne in 1921 to live in London, did some newspaper work and travelled. Wearying of that world too and with the death of his brother Penleigh in 1923, Boyd again turned to religion joining an Anglican Franciscan community in Dorset. This too was a phase, however, so he left and continued on as before. For almost twenty years he lived a nomadic life, never staying long in any place and owning few possessions. He survived financially on one hundred pounds a year from his parents, a short stint as acting editor of The British Australasian, and sporadic payments from his writing. Joan Lindsay, author of Picnic at Hanging Rock, remembers her cousin Martin as a gentleman. He was a modest, free-spirited bachelor, adept at finding comfortable lodging. She remembers, \\"‚Ä¶he had always had a nose for odd and unusual pieces of furniture and queer old paintings picked up for a few pounds. During the war he had embellished his dugout in France with a large statue of his favourite Dancing Faun, dragging it from one filthy hole to another until forced to abandon it forever in the oozing mud\\". In 1925 Boyd's first novel, Love Gods, was published. He had found his vocation and between 1925 and 1949 he published ten novels, a volume of autobiography and a children's story. While living in England he is recorded as having an affair with a woman. Boyd's sexuality was, and continues to be, the subject of conjecture. Illicit love, and same-sex desire, are prevailing themes in his work. A 1930s novel, The Shepherd of Admetus was rejected by publishers due to its overt homosexual narrative. After his father‚Äôs death in July 1940, his mother‚Äôs inheritance was released, which gave Boyd the financial freedom to live life however he chose. The money originally came from Martin‚Äôs grandmother Emma √† Beckett (n√©e Mills) and had been secured with the direct intervention of his male relatives. Boyd delayed a return to Australia in the hope he could return a success. His motivation was not to be a disappointment to his family and he was plagued by doubts about his own achievements. After the success of Lucinda Brayford, he returned to Australia in 1948, intending to remain living in his grandfather √† Beckett's home, 'The Grange', near Berwick. After three years he left again for England in 1951, disappointed by his dream of 'The Grange' and the past, ignored by the Australian literary establishment, and out of touch with his younger relatives. Boyd moved to Rome in 1957 where he wrote the Langton tetralogy, frequently considered his finest work, the second autobiography, Day of My Delight, the travel story Much else in Italy and a light novel The Tea-Time of Love. Despite his literary successes, Boyd‚Äôs medical expenses in the year before his death were paid by his nephews Arthur, Guy, and David Boyd. His loyalty to his family and friends was being generously repaid. Brenda Niall recounts, \\"A few days before Christmas 1971, Boyd was astonished to get an official letter from Canberra. The Commonwealth Literary Fund had awarded him $1000 and a life pension of $30 a week \\"out of regard for the part you have played in the development of the literature of Australia\\". This had come about because a number of his Australian friends had heard of his illness and financial difficulties; and stirred others to do something about it. Thelma Herring, Barrie Reid, Patrick White and Gough Whitlam (then Leader of the Federal Opposition and a member of the Commonwealth Literary Fund committee) were among those responsible.\\" Death Martin Boyd suffered from ill health for the last decade of his life. He died of cancer on 3 June 1972 just days after being received into the Catholic Church. He is buried near the poets John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley in Rome's Protestant 'English cemetery'. Critical reception and recognition In 1928 Boyd won the Australian Literature Society Gold Medal for his novel The Montforts. The novel, written under the pseudonym Martin Mills, is based on the history of Boyd's √† Beckett ancestors. In 1957, he again won the ALS Gold Medal award for A Difficult Young Man, published in his own name. Boyd wrote extensively, with early poems, autobiographical books, an essay pamphlet on modern youth, an extensive list of novels, five short stories, and articles on varying subjects, to his name. He is, however, most renowned for his novels, which were inspired, according to many critics, by his own life and family experiences. Often described as a witty author, Boyd is recognised as one of the most important Australian novelists of the 20th century although responses to his novels vary. Early works  * Verses The following novels were written under the pseudonym of Martin Mills, though Boyd later gave his birth name to The Montforts. First publication details given below. * Love Gods (London, England: Constable, 1925.) * Bangrane: a memoir (London, England: Constable, 1926.) * The Madeleine Heritage (Indianapolis, USA: Bobbs-Merrill, 1928.) This is the American edition of The Montforts (London, England: Constable, 1928.) * Dearest Idol (Indianapolis, USA: Bobbs- Merrill, 1929.) Published under the pseudonym Walter Beckett. Later works While almost all of Boyd‚Äôs novels were written in England, some regard his earlier novels as less refined when compared to his later works, those being: * Scandal of Spring (London, England: J. M. Dent, 1934) * The Lemon Farm (London, England: J. M. Dent, 1935) * The Painted Princess (London, England: Constable, 1936) For Children. * The Picnic (London, England: J. M. Dent, 1937) * Night of the Party (London, England: J. M. Dent, 1938) * Nuns in Jeopardy (London, England: J. M. Dent, 1940) * Lucinda Brayford (London, England: Cresset Press, 1946) * Such Pleasure (London, England: Cresset Press, 1949) * The Langton tetralogy which, though not published as a series during his lifetime, is now referred to as a collective: **The Cardboard Crown (London, England: Cresset Press, 1952) **A Difficult Young Man (London, England : Cresset Press, 1955) **Outbreak of Love (London, England: John Murray, 1957) **When Blackbirds Sing (London, England: Abelard-Schuman, 1962) * Why They Walk Out (Rome, M. Boyd, 1970) Unpublished works *The Shepherd Of Admetus *Bitter Sauces Autobiography *A Single Flame (London, England: J. M. Dent, 1939) *Day of My Delight: An Anglo-Australian Memoir (Melbourne, Victoria: Lansdowne, 1965) Subject matter While writing most his novels in England, Boyd's novels frequently focus on the contrasting and conflicting realities of upper-class English and Australian societies. He tended to concentrate on the niceties and absurdities of social exchanges, instead of a greater concern with universal problems of human life. Boyd‚Äôs works do, however, reflect the two major preoccupations of his own life: a spiritual and religious concern; and, the disillusionment with and displacement from the two countries he was affiliated with, England and Australia. This is referred to by Kathleen Fitzpatrick as \\"the Anglo- Australian malaise\\". The novels explore the importance of class and social standing in England and Australia that families such as the Boyds experienced. The novel Lucinda Brayford, is a good example of this preoccupation. Biographer and critic, Brian McFarlane, writes, \\"...Boyd is clearly preoccupied with the way qualities of character and patterns of behavior recur in families. Sometimes, indeed, his stress on hereditary influences seems so bluntly asserted as to rob the impulses and motivations of his characters of some of their interests\\". Responses to Boyd‚Äôs work vary from outright hostility, to others describing his novels as \\"alone in Australian Literature reflect[ing] the lives of an alienated British elite‚Ä¶\\". Fitzpatrick writes, \\"In spite of very great gifts, which included a prose style of great flexibility and grace, Martin Boyd, the man without a country and the writer without a subject has remained a gifted amateur rather than a professional novelist\\", while McFarlane describes Boyd‚Äôs virtues as \\"minor but real\\". Boyd‚Äôs novels are now published in the Penguin Twentieth Century Classics series, and he is described as \\"rubbing shoulders\\" with authors such as Kafka. In his own time, Boyd‚Äôs novels received few reviews in the Australian newspapers, and little critical attention between 1928 and 1949. While Boyd‚Äôs first three novels did not sell well and led to his following three novels being rejected by publishers, his novel, The Montforts achieved critical success. Despite this, Fitzpatrick wrote in 1963, \\"He has a public in England, and his novel Lucinda Brayford was a bestseller in America, but his work seems to be little known in Australia...\\". \\"Martin Boyd‚Äôs work is vaguely felt, I think, to be rather immoral because it is in conflict with the Australian ethos of the moment\\". In The Australian Book Review, McFarlane also claims that \\"There has always been something grudging about the Australian response to Boyd. Perhaps he would have been more critically and commercially popular if he had not confined himself to writing about the upper-middle classes\\".

The application provided computer-telephony functionality including voicemail, call recording, and the maintenance of a call history. The system is a combination of software and hardware. PhoneValet was awarded an Eddy award (Macworld Magazine's editors choice award) for 2006. History PhoneValet was initially released on July 23, 2003 as a system to maintain a list of inbound and outbound calls, including telephone numbers, start and end times and notes. The system also enabled pop-up announcements of incoming callers based on Caller ID, and a spoken announcement of this and ancillary information drawn from a user-maintained address book. Additional functionality included dialing with automatic determination of long distance and calling card codes. This initial version did not allow the telephone to be answered as the hardware device provided could not take the line off-hook. On June 30, 2004, Parliant released version 2.0 of PhoneValet, now with the Message Center moniker. This version shipped with a revised hardware device (the same one shipping today) designed to allow the computer to answer the telephone. The 2.0 product integrated voice mail messages into the 1.0 product's call history system. The new device also supported automatic gain control, providing the ability to make high-quality audio recordings of both sides of telephone calls. The manufacturer made several further releases within the 2.0 rubric, adding the ability to dial in to check for messages, information center features and real-time voicemail audio screening. On July 11, 2005, Message Center 3.0 was released. Along with this update, Parliant released two large PhoneValet extensions: PhoneValet Anywhere and PhoneValet PodCast. PhoneValet Anywhere allowed users to manage the core functions of the PhoneValet Message Center over the internet through a new web interface. PhoneValet PodCast was more of a tool-suite designed to help PodCast makers record and edit phone conversations, including a background sound scrubbing tool and a stereo audio editor with a DSP. The core Message Center 3.0 update added ring-tones, call blocking, and individualized greetings tied to specific callers. The 4.0 version March 17, 2006 was a free upgrade adding automatic recording of all calls on the line (prior to this time call recording was activated manually by the user). On November 20, 2006 Parliant released version 5.0 with automated attendant features and unlimited-depth call trees. Automated attendant functions allowed a caller to specify the person, department or extension they wish to be transferred to. The application accomplished this on a single line by paging the person or department through the computer's speakers, playing hold music to the caller in the meantime. If the call went unanswered the caller was directed to a voice mailbox or to make further selections. The product was discontinued in May 2011, with continued technical support until June 2012.

Synopsis The cartoon begins with the legendary Sinbad the Sailor overlooking the seas with his faithful parrot from atop the crow's nest of a merchant ship. Suddenly, he spots a group of nefarious pirates and their captain singing a shanty. He rallies his crew for retreat, but the pirates discover them and plan to steal their treasure. First they shoot their cannons at them, but Sinbad bats their cannonballs back and destroys them. Then their captain catches their ship with an anchor and the two crews engage each other in battle while their captains and their parrots duel it out. The pirate captain finds himself outnumbered, but then he uses a cannonball as a bowling ball to defeat Sinbad's crew. The sailor is tied up and forced to walk the plank into the ocean. Luckily, Sinbad's parrot saves him before he drowns and he manages to swim ashore to a deserted island, where he hallucinates dancing hula girls. He then finds the same pirates planning to bury the treasure on the island and tricks them into fighting each other by throwing coconuts at their heads from atop a tree, but is thrown off by an angry ape and discovered. They tie him to a tree and torment him until realizing that the tree was actually the leg of a giant, fire-breathing Roc, who overpowers the pirates. The captain retaliates by throwing the treasure chest at it, but the Roc catches it in its beak and flies away with Sinbad still attached. Sinbad's parrot unties him and forces the Roc to drop the treasure by destroying its tail-feathers. Sinbad activates a parachute in his hat and lands safely on his own ship with the treasure. He and his parrot then enjoy their victory with cigars until they realize they were the kind that explode.

The concept is named after Camille Jordan. :\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\lambda & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\lambda & 1 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots& \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\lambda & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\lambda \\\\end{pmatrix} Every Jordan block is thus specified by its dimension n and its eigenvalue \\\\lambda and is indicated as J_{\\\\lambda,n}. Any block diagonal matrix whose blocks are Jordan blocks is called a Jordan matrix; using either the \\\\oplus or the ‚Äú\\\\mathrm{diag}‚Äù symbol, the (n_1+\\\\ldots+n_r) \\\\times (n_1+\\\\ldots+n_r) block diagonal square matrix consisting of r diagonal blocks, where the first is J_{\\\\lambda_1,n_1}, the second is J_{\\\\lambda_2,n_2}, \\\\ldots, the r-th is J_{\\\\lambda_r,n_r}, can be compactly indicated as J_{\\\\lambda_1,n_1}\\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus J_{\\\\lambda_r,n_r} or \\\\mathrm{diag}\\\\left(J_{\\\\lambda_1,n_1}, \\\\ldots, J_{\\\\lambda_r,n_r}\\\\right), respectively.

Its Jordan-block structure can also be written as either J_{0,3}\\\\oplus J_{i,2}\\\\oplus J_{i,2}\\\\oplus J_{7,3} or \\\\mathrm{diag}\\\\left(J_{0,3},J_{i,2},J_{i,2},J_{7,3}\\\\right).  Linear algebra  Any n\\\\times n square matrix A whose elements are in an algebraically closed field K is similar to a Jordan matrix J, also in \\\\mathbb{M}_n (K), which is unique up to a permutation of its diagonal blocks themselves. J is called the Jordan normal form of A and corresponds to a generalization of the diagonalization procedure. A diagonalizable matrix is similar, in fact, to a special case of Jordan matrix: the matrix whose blocks are all 1\\\\times 1. More generally, given a Jordan matrix J=J_{\\\\lambda_1,m_1}\\\\oplus J_{\\\\lambda_2,m_2} \\\\oplus\\\\ldots\\\\oplus J_{\\\\lambda_N,m_N}, i.e. whose k^\\\\text{th} diagonal block, 1\\\\leq k\\\\leq N is the Jordan block J_{\\\\lambda_k,m_k} and whose diagonal elements \\\\lambda_k may not all be distinct, the geometric multiplicity of \\\\lambda\\\\in K for the matrix J, indicated as \\\\mathrm{gmul}_J \\\\lambda\\\\,, corresponds to the number of Jordan blocks whose eigenvalue is \\\\lambda. Whereas the index of an eigenvalue \\\\lambda for J, indicated as \\\\mathrm{idx}_J \\\\lambda\\\\,, is defined as the dimension of the largest Jordan block associated to that eigenvalue. The same goes for all the matrices A similar to J, so \\\\mathrm{idx}_A \\\\lambda\\\\, can be defined accordingly with respect to the Jordan normal form of A for any of its eigenvalues \\\\lambda \\\\in\\\\mathrm{spec}A. In this case one can check that the index of \\\\lambda for A is equal to its multiplicity as a root of the minimal polynomial of A (whereas, by definition, its algebraic multiplicity for A, \\\\mathrm{mul}_A \\\\lambda\\\\,, is its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial of A, i.e. \\\\det(A-xI)\\\\in K[x]). An equivalent necessary and sufficient condition for A to be diagonalizable in K is that all of its eigenvalues have index equal to 1, i.e. its minimal polynomial has only simple roots. Note that knowing a matrix's spectrum with all of its algebraic/geometric multiplicities and indexes does not always allow for the computation of its Jordan normal form (this may be a sufficient condition only for spectrally simple, usually low- dimensional matrices): the Jordan decomposition is, in general, a computationally challenging task. From the vector space point of view, the Jordan decomposition is equivalent to finding an orthogonal decomposition (i.e. via direct sums of eigenspaces represented by Jordan blocks) of the domain which the associated generalized eigenvectors make a basis for.  Functions of matrices  Let A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{M}_n (\\\\mathbb{C}) (i.e. a n\\\\times n complex matrix) and C\\\\in\\\\mathrm{GL}_n (\\\\mathbb{C}) be the change of basis matrix to the Jordan normal form of A, i.e. A=C^{-1}JC. Now let f(z) be a holomorphic function on an open set \\\\mathit{\\\\Omega} such that \\\\mathrm{spec}A\\\\subset \\\\mathit{\\\\Omega}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{C}, i.e. the spectrum of the matrix is contained inside the domain of holomorphy of f. Let :f(z)=\\\\sum_{h=0}^{\\\\infty}a_h (z-z_0)^h be the power series expansion of f around z_0\\\\in\\\\mathit{\\\\Omega}\\\\setminus\\\\mathrm{spec}A, which will be hereinafter supposed to be 0 for simplicity's sake. The matrix f(A) is then defined via the following formal power series :f(A)=\\\\sum_{h=0}^{\\\\infty}a_h A^h and is absolutely convergent with respect to the Euclidean norm of \\\\mathbb{M}_n (\\\\mathbb{C}). To put it another way, f(A)\\\\, converges absolutely for every square matrix whose spectral radius is less than the radius of convergence of f around 0 and is uniformly convergent on any compact subsets of \\\\mathbb{M}_n (\\\\mathbb{C}) satisfying this property in the matrix Lie group topology. The Jordan normal form allows the computation of functions of matrices without explicitly computing an infinite series, which is one of the main achievements of Jordan matrices. Using the facts that the k^\\\\mathrm{th} power (k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}_0) of a diagonal block matrix is the diagonal block matrix whose blocks are the k^\\\\mathrm{th} powers of the respective blocks, i.e. \\\\left(A_1 \\\\oplus A_2 \\\\oplus A_3 \\\\oplus\\\\ldots\\\\right)^k=A^k_1 \\\\oplus A_2^k \\\\oplus A_3^k \\\\oplus\\\\ldots, and that A^k=C^{-1}J^k C\\\\,, the above matrix power series becomes :f(A)=C^{-1}f(J)C=C^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\bigoplus_{k=1}^N f\\\\left(J_{\\\\lambda_k ,m_k}\\\\right)\\\\right)C where the last series need not be computed explicitly via power series of every Jordan block. In fact, if \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\mathit{\\\\Omega}, any holomorphic function of a Jordan block f(J_{\\\\lambda,n})\\\\, is the following upper triangular matrix: :f(J_{\\\\lambda,n})=\\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} f(\\\\lambda) & f^\\\\prime (\\\\lambda) & \\\\frac{f^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}(\\\\lambda)}{2} & \\\\cdots & \\\\frac{f^{(n-2)}(\\\\lambda)}{(n-2)!} & \\\\frac{f^{(n-1)}(\\\\lambda)}{(n-1)!} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & f(\\\\lambda) & f^\\\\prime (\\\\lambda) & \\\\cdots & \\\\frac{f^{(n-3)}(\\\\lambda)}{(n-3)!} & \\\\frac{f^{(n-2)}(\\\\lambda)}{(n-2)!} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & f(\\\\lambda) & \\\\cdots & \\\\frac{f^{(n-4)}(\\\\lambda)}{(n-4)!} & \\\\frac{f^{(n-3)}(\\\\lambda)}{(n-3)!} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & f(\\\\lambda) & f^\\\\prime (\\\\lambda) \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & f(\\\\lambda) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right)=\\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} a_0 & a_1 & a_2 & \\\\cdots & a_{n-2} & a_{n-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & a_0 & a_1 & \\\\cdots & a_{n-3} & a_{n-2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & a_0 & \\\\cdots & a_{n-4} & a_{n-3} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & a_0 & a_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & a_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right). As a consequence of this, the computation of any functions of a matrix is straightforward whenever its Jordan normal form and its change-of-basis matrix are known. Also, \\\\mathrm{spec}f(A)=f(\\\\mathrm{spec}A), i.e. every eigenvalue \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\mathrm{spec}A corresponds to the eigenvalue f(\\\\lambda)\\\\in\\\\mathrm{spec}f(A), but it has, in general, different algebraic multiplicity, geometric multiplicity and index. However, the algebraic multiplicity may be computed as follows: :\\\\text{mul}_{f(A)}f(\\\\lambda)=\\\\sum_{\\\\mu\\\\in\\\\text{spec}A\\\\cap f^{-1}(f(\\\\lambda))}~\\\\text{mul}_A \\\\mu.\\\\, The function f(T) of a linear transformation T between vector spaces can be defined in a similar way according to the holomorphic functional calculus, where Banach space and Riemann surface theories play a fundamental role. In the case of finite- dimensional spaces, both theories perfectly match.  Dynamical systems  Now suppose a (complex) dynamical system is simply defined by the equation :\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{z}}(t)=A(\\\\mathbf{c})\\\\mathbf{z}(t), :\\\\mathbf{z}(0)=\\\\mathbf{z}_0 \\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^n, where \\\\mathbf{z}:\\\\mathbb{R_+}\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{R} is the (n-dimensional) curve parametrization of an orbit on the Riemann surface \\\\mathcal{R} of the dynamical system, whereas A(\\\\mathbf{c}) is an n\\\\times n complex matrix whose elements are complex functions of a d-dimensional parameter \\\\mathbf{c}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^d. Even if A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{M}_n \\\\left(\\\\mathrm{C}^0(\\\\mathbb{C}^d)\\\\right) (i.e. A continuously depends on the parameter \\\\mathbf{c}) the Jordan normal form of the matrix is continuously deformed almost everywhere on \\\\mathbb{C}^d but, in general, not everywhere: there is some critical submanifold of \\\\mathbb{C}^d on which the Jordan form abruptly changes its structure whenever the parameter crosses or simply ‚Äútravels‚Äù around it (monodromy). Such changes mean that several Jordan blocks (either belonging to different eigenvalues or not) join together to a unique Jordan block, or vice versa (i.e. one Jordan block splits into two or more different ones). Many aspects of bifurcation theory for both continuous and discrete dynamical systems can be interpreted with the analysis of functional Jordan matrices. From the tangent space dynamics, this means that the orthogonal decomposition of the dynamical system's phase space changes and, for example, different orbits gain periodicity, or lose it, or shift from a certain kind of periodicity to another (such as period-doubling, cfr. logistic map). In a sentence, the qualitative behaviour of such a dynamical system may substantially change as the versal deformation of the Jordan normal form of A(\\\\mathbf{c}).  Linear ordinary differential equations  The simplest example of a dynamical system is a system of linear, constant-coefficient, ordinary differential equations, i.e. let A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{M}_n (\\\\mathbb{C}) and \\\\mathbf{z}_0 \\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^n: :\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{z}}(t)=A\\\\mathbf{z}(t), :\\\\mathbf{z}(0)=\\\\mathbf{z}_0, whose direct closed-form solution involves computation of the matrix exponential: :\\\\mathbf{z}(t)=e^{tA}\\\\mathbf{z}_0. Another way, provided the solution is restricted to the local Lebesgue space of n-dimensional vector fields \\\\mathbf{z}\\\\in\\\\mathrm{L}_{\\\\mathrm{loc}}^1 (\\\\mathbb{R}_+)^n, is to use its Laplace transform \\\\mathbf{Z}(s)=\\\\mathcal{L}[\\\\mathbf{z}](s). In this case :\\\\mathbf{Z}(s)=\\\\left(sI-A\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\mathbf{z}_0. The matrix function \\\\left(A-sI\\\\right)^{-1} is called the resolvent matrix of the differential operator \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}-A. It is meromorphic with respect to the complex parameter s\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C} since its matrix elements are rational functions whose denominator is equal for all to \\\\det (A-sI). Its polar singularities are the eigenvalues of A, whose order equals their index for it, i.e. \\\\mathrm{ord}_{(A-sI)^{-1}}\\\\lambda=\\\\mathrm{idx}_A \\\\lambda.

It is native to the Kashmir Valley, and common today among Kashmiri Pandits and Kashmiri Muslims of Hindu lineage. Outside Kashmir, it is used by members of the Kashmiri diaspora, in places like Punjab, Bengal, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, and more commonly in recent times by the global Kashmiri Pandit diaspora following the Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus in 1989‚Äì1990. History and origins Dhar originated as an honorific given to a village head, strongman, or warlord of a jagir. The title was widespread by the 12th century CE and continued until the 14th century CE. The earliest available records of Dhar or Dar used as a surname date back to the 16th century CE.  Difference between Dhar and Dar  The two surnames have a common origin, but the reason for their difference between the two is not settled. One theory suggests that the difference stems from the forms of Kashmiri spoken by Kashmiri Pandits and Muslims. Before the Sanskritisation and Persianisation of the Kashmiri language, it used the Sharada script, and the surname had a common pronunciation. When Sanskritised Kashmiri became more widely spoken by Kashmiri Pandits and Persianised Kashmiri by Kashmiri Muslims, the surnames developed a difference in pronunciation. An alternative theory suggests that with the advent of Islam in Kashmir, new Muslims modified their surnames to differentiate themselves from Kashmiri Pandits. A weakness of this theory, however, is that Kashmiri Muslims use Muslim forenames, which would have clearly differentiated their names from Hindu names.

F. Proctor, was a vaudeville impresario who pioneered the method of continuous vaudeville. He opened the Twenty-third Street Theatre in New York City. Bio Frederick Freeman Proctor was born to Alpheus Proctor and Lucy Ann Tufts in Dexter, Maine, where his father was a physician.1880 US Census; Dexter, Maine According to vaudeville historian Joe Laurie, Jr., Proctor broke into show business when a performer known as \\"Levantine\\" noticed him working out at the YMCA and recruited him as a partner in his act, which involved juggling barrels with his feet. Proctor later made a successful foray into European variety under the name \\"Levantine\\" before moving into theatrical management. From 1880 to 1889 he and his partner H. Jacob opened and operated theaters in Albany, Schenectady, Rochester, Utica, Buffalo, Syracuse, Brooklyn, Troy, New Haven, Bridgeport, Hartford, Lancaster, Lynn, Wilmington and Worcester. In 1889, he opened his most famous theater, Proctor's Twenty- third Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues in Manhattan. Emulating B.F. Keith's innovation in Boston, Proctor began presenting \\"continuous vaudeville\\" on 23rd Street. He later teamed up for a time with Keith but the partnership broke up. At his height, Proctor had a chain of fifty theaters. In 1929, he sold his remaining eleven to RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum).

Schenectady, New York Proctor opened his first theater in Schenectady, New York in 1912, near the Erie Canal. On April 14, 1925, ground was broken for the \\"new\\" Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady, New York at its present site. Designed by famed theater architect Thomas W. Lamb, the theater cost $1.5 million to build and had a seating capacity of 2,700. On December 27, 1926, Proctor's Theatre opened with a showing of Stranded in Paris, a silent film starring Bebe Daniels. Inside was a $50,000 Wurlitzer organ. Over 7,100 paid admissions were collected. In 1928, sound equipment was installed for the \\"talkies\\". On May 22, 1930, Proctor's was the site of the first public demonstration of television. An orchestra led by the image of a conductor that was sent from the General Electric laboratories over a mile away, and projected onto a seven-foot screen. The experiment was by Ernst Alexanderson. RKO In 1929 the chain was sold to the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation (RKO). Death Frederick F.

The foundation was named in memory of Lev Leviev's father Rabbi Avner Leviev. It supports a large network of Jewish educational institutions in the former Soviet Union, such as Jewish day schools, kindergartens and youth camps, a resource center and a teachers training institute. History While Jewish life in the countries of the former Soviet Union has existed for centuries, religious persecution reached new depths under 72 years of Communism. Jews who tried to uphold their faith and their traditions were harassed and often arrested, tortured and condemned to hard labor or executed. The remaining communities were decimated by World War II - bombardment, famine and, above all, the Holocaust wiped out three million Soviet Jews and left the rest shattered and forlorn. By the end of the 20th Century, Jewish life had all but ceased, and even those few who practiced Judaism in secret were left with little knowledge of their rich cultural and religious heritage. The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, relocated from Soviet Russia in 1927. From 1941 he directed a vast clandestine network of Jewish education, prayer services and humanitarian aid from his base in New York. Jewish activists risked their lives to keep the embers of Judaism alive by performing ritual circumcisions in secret, smuggling in haggadahs and matzoh at Passover, delivering kosher food to the starving and other acts of courage and compassion. The collapse of the Soviet system offered the third-largest Jewish population in the world the opportunity to worship freely for the first time in seven decades. More than 1 million Soviet Jews left for Israel and the United States, leaving at least 2 million to rebuild the ruins of Jewish community life with generous support from the Diaspora. Veterans of the Underground who remained, Jewish leaders who emerged after the fall of Communism and dozens of rabbis sent by Chabad-Lubavitch began building a new infrastructure of synagogues, community centers and day schools throughout the vast territory stretching through ten time zones. The latent embers kept alive by the Jewish underground movement burst into flames to restore literally hundreds of Jewish communities. In November 1998, leaders of these dispersed communities recognized the need for a united and efficient umbrella group. They pooled their professional, financial and technical resources to create the Federation of Jewish Communities.

Brisben was on the Socialist Party USA's presidential ticket twice. He ran as a candidate for president of the United States in the 1992 presidential election. Previously, Brisben had been the Socialist Party USA's candidate for vice president in 1976 as the running mate of Frank P. Zeidler. Background John Quinn Brisben was born September 6, 1934 to Olive and John Brisben of Enid, Oklahoma. He grew up during the Dust Bowl era with his brother, Joseph, matriculating through Enid Public Schools and graduating Enid High School in 1952. He also studied at Phillips University. He met Andrea Rosaaen, a needlepoint artist, while studying at the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from the College of Arts and Sciences in 1955, and she from the College of Fine Arts in 1954. They married in 1955 and then lived for some time in Madison, Wisconsin while he studied for his graduate degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Teaching career J. Quinn Brisben taught history and social studies for 32 years at the high school and middle school level, including briefly in Gurnee, Illinois before relocating to Chicago, where he taught at Mason Upper Grade Center, Thomas Kelly High School and Harlan High until his retirement in 1990. He served several terms as a representative in the American Federation of Teachers, Local 1, and frequently served on strike committees. He received several teaching awards, including being named Teacher of the Year by Teachers for Integrated Schools in 1964. Activism J. Quinn Brisben was active as an ally in many social movements during his lifetime, beginning with the Civil Rights Movement. Brisben took part in the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964‚Äîwhere he was briefly jailed‚Äîand in several Southern Christian Leadership Conference-sponsored activities in Alabama from 1965 to 1967. As a student at the University of Oklahoma in the 1950s, Brisben was once physically attacked for being the first white member of the local NAACP chapter. He was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement and served as a boycott captain for the United Farm Workers.

According to the 2011 census, 11,079 people live within its 2.6 km¬≤ area. It lies on the banks of the Neris River, and is situated to the west of the Lithuanian Parliament building. The river surrounds it from three sides and isolates it from the city. On the other side of the river, to the northwest, lies Vingis Park. Initially, it was a private out of town hunting area until the end of the 19th century, later it was developed as a resort and therefore many decorated wooden houses have survived from these times. History Originally the district belonged to the Grand duke Vytautas the Great, who established forest reserve there, and later to Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family, who has built wooden hunting house in the area and maintained wild animals for hunting purposes (hence the name). In 1825, a summer house was built which later became the residence of the Governor General of the Vilna Governorate. At the very end of the 19th century, ≈Ωvƒórynas became the property of Russian businessman Vasiliy Martinson who in turn sold individual tracts of land to the city's residents. In 1901, the resort town was incorporated into the city of Vilnius. It remained mostly residential with very few industrial enterprises. After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, ≈Ωvƒórynas became one of the most prestigious neighborhoods of the capital due to the proximity of Seimas, the number of embassies, Neris river and the Vingis Park. ≈Ωvƒórynas has a number of government and educational institutions, finance and insurance companies, as well as health care institutions. ≈Ωvƒórynas is the site of Vilnius' only kenesa. There are also Russian Orthodox Our Lady of the Sign church (1899-1903) near ≈Ωvƒórynas bridge (1907), Orthodox chapel (1871) near Vingis pedestrian bridge and Catholic church in the Northern part of the district, the later being not finished according to the project because of the World War I (fa√ßade towers and dome were never built). ≈Ωvƒórynas is famous for its well preserved and maintained wooden architecture and interwar brick villas as well as modern architecture. There are more than a hundred wooden summer cottages and city villas, built mostly in 1890s-1910s. Compositors' modernist quarter of 16 villas, designed for leading Lithuanian musicians and a palace for concerts and various events, were built in the 1960s.

He is considered to be one of the most important seers in the history of Dvaita school of thought on account of his sound elucidations of the works of Madhvacharya. He is credited with structuring the philosophical aspects of Dvaita and through his polemical works, elevating it to an equal footing with the contemporary schools of thought. Along with Madhva and Vyasatirtha, he is venerated as one of the three great spiritual sages, or munitraya of Dvaita. Born into an aristocratic Marathi-speaking Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin family, he later adopted the cause of Dvaita after an encounter with the Madhva saint, Akshobhya Tirtha (d. 1365 ). He composed 22 works, consisting of commentaries on the works of Madhva and several independent treatises criticizing the tenets of contemporary schools, especially Advaita, while simultaneously elaborating upon the Dvaita thought. His dialectical skill and logical acumen earned him the distinction of ·π¨ƒ´kacƒÅrya or commentator par excellence. Biography Historical sources on Jayatirtha's life is scant. Most of the information about his life is derived from two hagiographies: A·πáu Jayatƒ´rtha Vijaya and B·πõhad Jayatƒ´rtha Vijaya from his disciple, VyƒÅsatirtha (not to be confused with Vyasatirtha) and a compilation by ChalƒÅri Sa·πÅkar·π£a·πáacƒÅrya (c. 1700). He was born Dho·πá·∏çu (or Dho·πá·∏ço) Pant Raghunath to a Brahmin Deshpande family. The place of his birth is assigned to either Mangalwedha or Manyakheta. According to the hagiographies, his father was a nobleman of military rank and importance. Dho·πá·∏ço Pant grew up in affluence, with a certain predilection towards sports, especially horse riding. At the age of twenty, after a chance encounter with the ascetic Akshobhya Tƒ´rtha on the banks of river Kagini or river Bhima, he underwent a transformation which led him to renounce his former life, but not without resistance from his family. After much deliberation, his family relented and he was subsequently initiated into the Dvaita fold by Akshobhya Tƒ´rtha, who named him Jayatƒ´rtha. Jayatirtha succeeded Akshobhya as the pontiff in 1365. He composed several commentaries and treatises in the brief span of 23 years between his initiation and death in 1388. The location of his tomb (Brindavana) is a matter of controversy. Works There have been 22 works accredited to Jayatirtha, 18 of which are commentaries on the works of Madhvacharya. Nyaya Sudha, which is a commentary on Madhva's Anu Vyakhyana, is considered to be his magnum opus. Running up to 24,000 verses, it discusses and critiques a variety of philosophers and their philosophies, ranging from the orthodox schools of Hinduism like Mimamsa and Nyaya to heterodox schools like Buddhism and Jainism, arguing in favour of Dvaita. Apart from commentaries, he has authored 4 original treatises of which Pramana Paddhati and Vadavali stand apart. Pramana Paddhati is a short monograph on the epistemology of Dvaita dealing with the pramanas in question, theory of truth and error and validity of knowledge while Vadavali deals with the nature of reality and illusion. Legacy Jayatirtha occupies a special place in the history of Dvaita Literature. The lucidity and measured style of his writing coupled with his keen dialectical ability has allowed his works to percolate through time, reinforced by the commentaries of later philosophers like Vyasatirtha, Raghuttama Tirtha, Raghavendra Tirtha and Vadiraja Tirtha. Dasgupta remarks \\"Jayatirtha and Vyasatirtha present the highest dialectical skill in Indian thought\\". His masterpiece, Nyaya Sudha or Nectar of Logic, deals with refuting an encyclopaedic range of philosophies that were in vogue at the time. Pereira notes \\"His monumental Nectar of Logic is one of the pinnacles of Indic theological achievement\\". Brindavana Scholarly opinion is divided on the location of Jayatirtha's tomb. Tradition considers Malkhed as the legitimate location of Jayatirtha's mortal remains while some claim that historical evidence and Vadiraja Tirtha's Tirthaprabanda point to Nava Brindavana as the actual location.

History Early years  Old Crescent grew out of the Crescent College Munster School's cup team of 1947. Fr Gerry Guinane, who trained rugby in the College, saw great potential in that winning team and persuaded them to stay and play together. In September 1947 it became a member club of the Munster Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union. In 1952 the club was promoted to senior club membership of the Branch and the ‚ÄòGinner‚Äôs‚Äô formidable negotiating skills were more than useful in the process. Father Guinane remained deeply involved with the club until his death. Membership was initially confined to past pupils of Crescent College SJ, however it has been an 'open club' for many years. Contact is closely maintained with the school, and pupils and past pupils are encouraged to play with the club. Father Guinane‚Äôs belief in the original team was justified as in 1950/51 it reached the Munster Junior Cup final losing out to Cork Constitution five points to three and in 1954/55 again won through to the Munster Senior Cup final losing out in the end to UCC. Over the years progress on the field was mixed. In 1961/62 under the captaincy of Billy Leahy the club again reached the Munster Senior Cup Final only to lose to Bohemians. In 1976 the club won its first senior trophy, the Limerick Charity Cup. 1990s‚Äìpresent In 1991/92 Old Crescent won the Munster Senior League and went on to defeat the winners of the Leinster, Connacht, and Ulster Senior Leagues, Clontarf, Galwegians, and NIFC respectively. Old Crescent, Clontarf and Galwegians won promotion to the All Ireland League. Malone, CYMS and Sundays Well lost their places. In 1995 / 96 under the captaincy of Diarmuid Reddan and the coaching team of Larry Greene, Jed O'Dwyer and John Hogan, the club won the Division 2 title going undefeated in the league campaign and achieved promotion to Division 1. The team held their position in Division 1 for 2 years, then regained their place for a season in 1999 / 2000. Since then the team has been a constant challenger for promotion many times coming within a game of this. At junior level, the 3rd XV captained by Mike O'Mara and managed by Eugene O'Riordan captured National honours by winning the Junior 2 Millennium Cup in 2001 / 2002.

He pitched in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers from 2006 through 2010. Baseball career Zumaya was drafted out of Bonita Vista High School in the 11th round by the Tigers, the 320th overall selection of the 2002 MLB Draft. He was chosen because of his power arm, but it was not clear whether he would be able to develop adequate control of an off-speed pitch. He is known for his fastball, which catcher Ivan Rodriguez credits as having been the fastest pitch he ever caught. Minor league career Zumaya began his stint in the Tigers minor league system as a starting pitcher. Because he was drafted straight out of high school, Zumaya frequently pitched against players older than himself. In 2003, the 18-year-old Zumaya made great strides pitching for the Low-A affiliate West Michigan Whitecaps. 2004 saw Zumaya begin the year pitching for the High-A affiliate Lakeland Tigers, before a late season promotion to the Double-A Erie SeaWolves. He finished the season with a .500 win‚Äìloss record and struggled with walks. Zumaya began the 2005 season back in Erie; however, his results were much improved from 2004, and he was soon promoted to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. He finished the season with 199 strikeouts in 151 innings pitched. In 77 games over four seasons, Zumaya was 27‚Äì19, and averaged 6.4 hits and 11.1 strikeouts per nine innings. Major league career Detroit Tigers (2006‚Äì2011) With the Tigers, he was most often used as a middle relief pitcher and occasionally as a setup man. Zumaya was a fan favorite for his intense, aggressive attitude on the mound and his fastball, which topped out at . This was the fastest pitch ever recorded at that time./http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/fastest- pitcher-in-baseball.shtml He also had a very good knuckle-curve that he used as an off-speed pitch. He was among the primary reasons for the Tigers bullpen success in 2006, joining fellow rookie Justin Verlander on the resurgent 2006 Tigers team. However, Zumaya was hampered by injuries to his throwing arm following his rookie season in 2006, and was never the same pitcher again. While he held batters to a .187 batting average in 2006, he was even tougher with runners in scoring position (.176), and two outs and runners in scoring position (.143). Zumaya remained in the bullpen for the 2006 playoffs. However, Zumaya was sidelined for the 2006 American League Championship Series by a sore wrist, which Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski disclosed in a December 2006 radio interview was due to Zumaya playing the PlayStation 2 video game Guitar Hero.Guitar hero? Pitcher hurt playing video game Dave Dombrowski on WXYT 12/13/2006 This was acknowledged by the game's developers with a message on the credits of the Xbox 360 version of Guitar Hero II: No pitchers were harmed in the making of this game. Except for one. Joel Zumaya. He had it coming. In a 2016 interview with the Detroit News, however, Zumaya said the Guitar Hero story was just a cover, and not true. While refusing to disclose the actual source of the injury, and calling the Guitar Hero story his \\"final answer,\\" he also admitted that it was \\"some bogus stuff.\\" Zumaya's future was then clouded by injury: in May 2007, he ruptured a tendon in his hand, requiring surgery and 12 weeks rehab. On August 2, 2007, the Tigers activated Zumaya from the 15-day disabled list after not playing since May 1. The next day, he made his first major league appearance following the injury, pitching to one batter in a game against the Cleveland Indians. Zumaya sustained another injury, this time to his shoulder, during the 2007 offseason. While helping his father move some boxes in the attic at his father's home in advance of a fire approaching the area, a box fell on his right (pitching) shoulder, separating it. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list at the start of the 2008 season. After appearing in six successful minor league rehab games for the Single-A Lakeland Flying Tigers and Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, Zumaya rejoined the Tigers on June 20, 2008. Zumaya was placed on the 15-day DL with a sore right shoulder on March 27, 2009. He was reactivated by the end of April; however, he was placed back on the 15-day DL following a July 18 appearance against the New York Yankees, where it was reported he could barely move his right (throwing) arm. Zumaya had surgery in August, ending his season. On June 28, 2010, Zumaya injured his elbow in the eighth inning, while pitching against the Minnesota Twins' Delmon Young at Target Field. He was in obvious pain and needed assistance walking off the field. The next day an MRI revealed he had a non-displaced fracture of the olecranon.

However, he also claimed that Zumaya had the most consistently fast pitches he had seen in person since former Houston Astros Nolan Ryan and J. R. Richard. However, there is a new technology on the horizon that reads pitch speeds more accurately and does not inflate those numbers. It uses cameras and software to obtain the data. This new technology comes from Major League Baseball in its Advanced Media section. Part of Enhanced Gameday tracks pitch speed, break, and trajectory.

While it is signed north‚Äìsouth, the southern portion runs in an east‚Äìwest direction across Wyoming and Erie counties, from its beginning at a junction with NY 19 north of the village of Gainesville to the village of East Aurora. The part of the route north of East Aurora follows a generally north‚Äìsouth alignment to an intersection with NY 18 in the Niagara County town of Newfane (at the hamlet of Olcott), just south of the Lake Ontario shoreline. The route is most closely identified in the region with Transit Road, a major north‚Äìsouth trunk road through the center of Erie and Niagara counties; however, NY 78 does not follow Transit Road for its entire length, nor does Transit Road comprise more than half its length. The highway joins Transit Road north of East Aurora and stays with the road until nearly its end in the city of Lockport. The section of NY 78 between NY 5 in the town of Amherst and the Lake Ontario shoreline in Newfane was originally designated New York State Route 32 in the mid-1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 32 was absorbed into NY 78, which ran from Gainesville to Newfane upon assignment. From East Aurora to Depew, NY 78 originally used a slightly more easterly alignment along several local streets and a section of NY 422\\\\. Two realignments in the 1930s moved the route onto its modern alignment, and NY 78's original routing between East Aurora and Depew was briefly designated NY 78A during the mid-1930s. Route description  Wyoming County  NY 78 begins at an intersection with NY 19 at the northern end of the Wyoming County village of Gainesville. NY 78 proceeds westward from NY 19 as Delhi Road, a two-lane residential road through the rural sections of Gainesville. At a junction with Dolph Road, NY 78 bends southwest, dropping the Delhi Road moniker, and soon entering the hamlet of Wethersfield, located in the town of the same name. In Wethersfield, NY 78 is a two-lane residential street, intersecting with the northern terminus of County Route 10 (CR 10; Hardys Road) and southern terminus of CR 4 (Hermitage Road). NY 78 southbound at the junction with the northern terminus of NY 362 in Wethersfield After the hamlet of Wethersfield, NY 78 continues southwest, crossing through rural farms as a two-lane roadway, intersecting with the southern terminus of CR 57 (Poplar Tree Road). A short distance after CR 57, NY 78 intersects with the northern terminus of NY 362 while winding southwest through Wethersfield. At the intersection with Maxwell Drive, NY 78 becomes westbound, remaining rural for several miles. After the intersection with Irish Road, NY 78 makes a gradual bend to the southwest, then north. At the end of this bend, NY 78 intersects with the eastern terminus of CR 54 (Chaffee Road) and the northern terminus of CR 11 (East Arcade Road). Now in the town of Java, NY 78 uses the right-of-way once used by CR 11 northbound, winding past several farms as it proceeds northward. A short distance to the north, NY 78 intersects with NY 98 southbound. Both NY 78 north and NY 98 south turn west on a wrong-way concurrency through the town of Java, running as a two-lane residential street through dense woods and wide fields. Continuing west through Java, NY 78 and NY 98 cross over a railroad line and enter the hamlet of Java Center. In Java Center, NY 78 and NY 98 intersect with the southern terminus of NY 77 (Cattaraugus Road). This intersection also doubles as the terminus of the NY 78 and NY 98 concurrency as NY 98 proceeds south on NY 77's right-of-way. NY 78 northbound along the wrong-way concurrency through Java with NY 98 southbound NY 78 bends northwest on Main Street and out of Java Center as a two-lane rural roadway through the town of Java. The route soon drops the Main Street moniker, winding northwest into an intersection with CR 44 (Curriers Road). After CR 44, NY 78 runs northwest as a two-lane residential road, passing numerous houses before intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR 15 (Holland Road). After an intersection with Elm Road, NY 78 regains the Main Street moniker, crossing into the town of Sheldon and into the hamlet of Strykersville. Through Strykersville, NY 78 is a two- lane residential street, intersecting with the western terminus of CR 9 (Perry Road) and the southern terminus of CR 35 (Dutch Hollow Road). After CR 35, NY 78 bends northwest out of Strykersville, crossing into the rural sections of Sheldon surrounding the hamlet. Near the intersection with Chester Street, NY 78 crosses the county line into Erie County and into the town of Wales.  Erie County   Wales to West Seneca Now in the Erie County town of Wales, NY 78 changes monikers from Main Street to Strykersville Road, paralleling Buffalo Creek northwest through the rural section of Wales. A short distance northwest, NY 78 intersects with CR 175 (Center Line Road), which connects to the Wyoming County line a short distance east. For a short distance after the intersection, the two routes parallel, with NY 78 bypassing the hamlet of Wales Hollow and intersecting with the northern terminus of CR 387 (East Creek Road). Still known as Strykersville Road, NY 78 parallels Buffalo Creek into the southern terminus of CR 385 (Schang Road). The two-lane rural roadway remains the same for several miles to the northwest, crossing an intersection with CR 382 (Hunters Creek Road). NY 78 northbound at the junction with US 20A in the town of Wales Continuing northwest through Wales, NY 78 remains a two-lane rural street known as Strykersville Road until intersecting with US 20A (Big Tree Road) at a T-intersection. US 20A and NY 78 become concurrent along Big Tree, proceeding west through the town of Wales. The routes remain a two-lane residential street for a distance, intersecting with CR 383 (Reiter Road) as it winds west. Now in the town of Aurora, US 20A and NY 78 enter a large interchange with NY 400 (the Aurora Expressway). A short distance later, the routes enter the village of East Aurora. Now known as Main Street, US 20A and NY 78 proceed west as a two-lane village street, intersecting with NY 16 (Olean Road) and the southern continuation of CR 6 (Pine Street). NY 16 joins the US 20A and NY 78 concurrency as it proceeds west on Main Street, becoming the main commercial thoroughfare through the village. The routes cross over railroad tracks in the center of East Aurora, returning to the residential street it was earlier, which reverts at Center Street. Several blocks to the west, US 20A, NY 16 and NY 78 enter a roundabout at the western end of East Aurora, where US 20A forks southwest on Hamburg Street, while NY 16 and NY 78 join up with CR 572 (Buffalo Street) and proceed northwest out of the village. Now in the town of Aurora once again, NY 16, NY 78 and CR 572 proceed northwest past Knox Farm State Park, intersecting with CR 377 (Williardshire Road). At CR 377, the moniker changes from Buffalo Street to Seneca Street as NY 16, NY 78 and CR 572 enter the town of Elma. Passing the town water tower, NY 16, NY 78 and CR 572 proceed northwest through Elma as a two-lane commercial and residential road, intersecting with the western terminus of CR 528 (West Blood Road). The routes slowly becomes commercial once again, passing a large industrial building before entering an at-grade interchange with CR 574 (Jamison Road). Before 1980, this intersection served as the western terminus of NY 422. After CR 574, NY 16, NY 78 and CR 572 continue northwest along Seneca Street as a two-lane residential roadway through Elma. Bending northwest, the routes enter the hamlet of Spring Brook, where it intersects with CR 140 (Rice Road) and CR 362 (North Davis Road). Paralleling Cazenovia Creek, NY 16, NY 78 and CR 572 intersect with the southern terminus of CR 95 (Pound Road). The route remains a two-lane residential road for a distance, soon bending further northwestward into the town of West Seneca. In West Seneca, the three routes intersect with US 20 (Transit Road). At this intersection, NY 78 turns north onto a concurrency with US 20 while NY 16 proceeds northwest along CR 215\\\\. This junction serves as the northern terminus of CR 572\\\\. Now concurrent with US 20, NY 78 runs north along Transit Road as a four-lane commercial boulevard, quickly entering a cloverleaf interchange with NY 400 (the Aurora Expressway) once again.  Transit Road  US 20 and NY 78, eastbound and northbound, respectively, at the interchange with NY 400 in West Seneca US 20 and NY 78 proceed northward along Transit Road, remaining a major commercial thoroughfare street serving the eastern suburbs of Buffalo with limited pockets of residential along its run. Throughout its north-south run to the Erie County-Niagara County line to the north Transit Road serves as the town line boundaries of West Seneca and Elma, Cheektowaga and Lancaster, and Amherst and Clarence, respectively, except for a brief period where it passes through the Village of Depew, which straddles the Cheektowaga-Lancaster line. After an intersection with CR 330 (Bullis Road), Transit Road continues north as a five lane road, serving as the town line between West Seneca to the west and Elma to the east, paralleling several residential districts on each side and crossing an intersection with CR 325 (Seneca Creek Road / Main Street). Just after CR 325, US 20 and NY 78 proceed over Buffalo Creek and into an intersection with NY 354 (Clinton Street). Now on the Lancaster‚ÄìCheektowaga town line, US 20 and NY 78 continue northward along Transit Road, intersecting with the western terminus of CR 321 (French Road). Passing several strip malls, US 20 and NY 78 continue north along Transit Road, passing several residential complexes. After Madeira Drive, Transit Road becomes a four-lane industrial boulevard again, passing several factories on each side of the road. The routes become commercial again, intersecting with CR 523 (Como Park Boulevard). Paralleling Cayuga Creek to the west, US 20 and NY 78 become a four-lane commercial boulevard again. A short distance later, the routes cross over Cayuga Creek and enter an intersection with the western terminus of NY 130 (Broadway). At this junction, NY 78 continues north on Transit Road, while US 20 turns east onto Broadway through the village of Depew. Continuing north on Transit Road, NY 78 becomes a four-lane commercial boulevard through Depew, crossing over railroad tracks owned by CSX Transportation and used by Amtrak just east of the village's Amtrak station. After crossing the tracks, NY 78 intersects with Walden Avenue (NY 952Q), a major arterial out of the city of Buffalo. Continuing north through Depew, NY 78 intersects with the eastern terminus of CR 316 (George Urban Boulevard). Continuing north through Depew, NY 78 and Transit Road remain the four-lane commercial boulevard through the center of town, passing numerous businesses. Outside of the village, NY 78 connects to CR 161 (Pleasant View Drive). NY 78 and Transit Road remain four lanes, passing several commercial businesses and entering an intersection with NY 33 (Genesee Street) and crossing over Ellicott Creek. The route crosses over a former railroad grade, soon intersecting with CR 324 (Aero Drive). Just after CR 324, NY 78 and Transit Road enter an intersection with the feeder roads to exit 49 of the New York State Thruway (I-90). NY 78 and Transit Road north of I-90 continues as the town line of Amherst to the west and Lancaster to the east. After crossing Wehrle Drive (CR 290 and CR 275), transit road serves as the town line of Amherst to the west and Clarence to the east until the Erie County line. . NY 324) overpass North of Wehrle Drive, Transit Road widens to six and then eight lanes wide as it passes through a dense commercial shopping distance along the Amherst-Clarence town line until NY 5 (Main Street). The route condenses back to six lanes along the Eastern Hills Mall in Clarence, entering an intersection with a feeder road that connects to NY 324 (Sheridan Drive). NY 78 and Transit Road continue north, crossing under NY 324 and condense down to four lanes once again. NY 78 passes through more strip malls to the north of NY 324\\\\.

Soon entering the hamlet of Swormville, NY 78 and Transit Road remain a four-lane commercial boulevard through Amherst and Clarence. After Swormville, NY 78 and Transit Road become residential, soon becoming two lanes for the first time since West Seneca. NY 78 southbound in Swormville Crossing north along the Amherst- Clarence line still, NY 78 and Transit Road becomes a mix of commercial and residential, passing large sections of fields north of Swormville. A short distance to the north, NY 78 intersects with the northern terminus of NY 263 (Millersport Highway). After crossing an intersection with Tonawanda Creek Road (CR 2 and CR 559) that also doubled as the former intersection with NY 268, NY 78 and Transit Road widen to four lanes and cross over Tonawanda Creek into Niagara County.  Niagara County  After crossing Tonawanda Creek, NY 78 and Transit Road enter the town of Lockport as a four-lane boulevard. Intersecting with the western terminus of CR 117 and the eastern terminus of CR 60 (both North Tonawanda Creek Road), NY 78 and Transit Road continue north as the four-lane commercial boulevard through Lockport. The route remains four lanes, but becomes a boulevard through wide fields for a distance, passing runway 28 of North Buffalo Suburban Airport. Now in the town of Pendleton for a short distance, NY 78 and Transit Road cross through a long stretch of fields, becoming a commercial boulevard to the north. NY 78 through Lockport After an intersection with CR 12 (Rapids Road), NY 78 and Transit Road continue north through Pendleton, soon crossing into the town of Lockport once again.

History The north‚Äìsouth roadway connecting NY 5 in Amherst to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Olcott via Lockport was originally designated as NY 32 in the mid-1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 32 became part of NY 78, a new route extending from Gainesville in the south to Olcott in the north, mostly along existing but previously unnumbered roads. However, the portion between NY 362 and NY 19 was in the process of being built.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering NY 78's early routing was identical to its modern alignment except from East Aurora to Depew. Initially, NY 78 headed north from East Aurora to Lancaster by way of Maple Street, Jamison and Bowen roads, and Clinton (NY 354) and Aurora streets before following NY 35 west to Transit Road in Depew. NY 78 was realigned to follow US 20 (now US 20A) west from East Aurora to Transit Road, where it turned north onto Transit Road and followed it to Depew. The former routing of NY 78 between East Aurora and Lancaster was redesignated as NY 78A. NY 78 was rerouted one last time to overlap with NY 16 northwest from East Aurora to its junction with Transit Road in West Seneca. The realignment bypassed the southernmost portion of Transit Road, which became NY 187 in the early 1940s. NY 78A NY 78A was an alternate route of NY 78 in Erie County between NY 78 in East Aurora and NY 35 (now US 20) in Lancaster. The route began at the modern intersection of Main (then-US 20) and Maple streets in East Aurora and followed Maple Street, Jamison and Bowen roads, and Clinton (NY 354) and Aurora streets to a terminus at Broadway (NY 35) in Lancaster. It was assigned after NY 78 was rerouted to follow US 20 and Transit Road instead between East Aurora and Depew. The NY 78A designation was short-lived as it was removed . Its routing is now part of several county routes as well as NY 354\\\\.

The film stars Laura Harris, Richard Lintern, Francis Magee, Alex Roe, and Alice Krige. Plot Following in the same vein as such classics as Rosemary's Baby and The Omen, The Calling is the story of Kristie St. Clair, the involuntary mother of the Antichrist, and possibly the only person who can stop the coming of a modern-day apocalypse. At first Kristie (Harris) believes that she has the perfect life: Marc (Lintern), her charming TV personality husband; Dylan (Alex Roe), her beautiful young son; an enchanting house in the British countryside; a successful new career... But as time goes by she begins to suspect something's not right with her family. First, there's Dylan's increasingly violent behavior, which includes the impaling of his pet guinea pig on a stake and his apathy towards the death of a friend. Kristie cannot understand how her son, who she had focused so much energy and love on since he was born, could have turned out so heartless. Then there's the fact that Elizabeth (Krige), an old family friend, seems to be trying her hardest to replace Kristie and keep her away from Marc and Dylan as often as possible. Marc himself begins acting strangely, overreacting after a dog bite and hanging the dog in the backyard as punishment. It becomes apparent to Kristie that something is very, very wrong, and that she is out of the loop. As her family withdraws further and further from her and she loses her best friend, Kristie turns to a mysterious taxi driver who seems to know a whole lot about everything. All Kristie wants is to save her son, even if it turns out that it is the Devil himself who is standing in her way. With the help of the taxi driver, Kristie makes some shocking discoveries about her loved ones and comes to the conclusion that unless she stops him, Dylan will lead mankind into a horrifically malevolent future. At the end, Kristie, who has now stopped caring for Dylan, escapes the hospital with Father Mullin and tells him it was a new time.

The two most significant types are one that developed in Europe, characterized by a tiered structure using promotion and relegation to determine participation in a hierarchy of leagues or divisions, and a North American originated model characterized by its use of franchises, closed memberships, and minor leagues. Both these systems remain most common in their area of origin, although both systems are used worldwide. Etymology The term league has many different meanings in different areas around the world, and its use for different concepts can make comparisons confusing. Usually a league is a group of teams that play each other during the season. It is also often used for the name of the governing body that oversees the league, as in America's Major League Baseball or England's Football League. Because most European football clubs participate in different competitions during a season, regular-season home- and-away games are often referred to as league games and the others as non- league or cup games, even though the separate competitions may be organized by the same governing body. Also, there is a rugby football code called rugby league, which is distinct from rugby union. Structure of North American leagues (Franchise and minor league system) All Cities in the US and Canada with at least one team in the MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL or NHL, 2018 Professional sports leagues in North America comprise a stipulated number of teams, known as franchises, which field one team each.Rader, Benjamin G.; 2002; Baseball:A History of America's Game; Second Edition; University of Illinois Press The franchises have territorial rights, usually exclusive territories large enough to cover major metropolitan areas, so that they have no local rivals. New teams may enter the competition only by a vote of current members; typically, a new place is put up for bid by would-be owners. The \\"franchise system\\"Shropshire, Kenneth L. \\"The sports franchise game: Cities in pursuit of sports franchises, events, stadiums and arenas\\" was introduced in baseball with the formation of the National League in 1876Before 1876, baseball clubs joined the professional class (1869-1870) or the professional association by announcing their intentions and paying any required fees, an open system. and later adopted by the other North American leagues. Although member teams are corporate entities separate from their leagues, they operate only under league auspices. North American teams do not play competitive games against outside opponents. The leagues operate in a closed-system and do not have promotion and relegation. It is organized in a way that assures the teams' continued existence in the league from year to year. On occasion a league may decide to grow by admitting a new expansion team into the league. Most of the teams in the four major North American leagues were created as part of a planned league expansion or through the merger of a rival league. Only one team in the National Hockey League, for example, existed before becoming part of the NHL. The rest of the teams were created ex novo as expansion teams or as charter members of the World Hockey Association, which merged with the NHL in 1979. American and Canadian sports leagues typically have a \\"playoff\\" system where the best teams in a given season compete in a tournament, with the winner being crowned champion of the league. These have their roots in the long travel distances common in US and Canadian sports; to cut down on travel, leagues are typically divided into geographic divisions and feature unbalanced schedules with teams playing more matches against opponents in the same division. Due to this, not all teams face the same opponents, and some teams may not meet during a regular season at all. This results in teams with identical records that have faced different opponents differing numbers of times, making team records alone an imperfect measure of league supremacy. Major League Soccer is technically not an association of franchises but a single business entity, though each team has an owner-operator; the team owners are actually shareholders in the league. The league, not the individual teams, contracts with the players. Unlike teams in the four major North American sports leagues, several Major League Soccer teams qualify to play competitive matches in the CONCACAF Champions League against teams from outside the U.S. and Canada, and MLS uses playing rules set by the international governing body of its sport. MLS followed its own playing rules until 2004, when it adopted FIFA rules. Under the auspices of US Soccer and the Canadian Soccer Association, respectively, the U.S. and Canada have separate knockout cup competitions during the MLS season that include teams from lower leagues. In the U.S., the U.S. Open Cup has had MLS participation from the league's inception; since the 2012 cup, each competition has featured all American-based MLS sides. Similarly, all of Canada's MLS teams compete in the Canadian Championship. However, the league structure of MLS follows the North American model, with a single premier league and no promotion or relegation. Major League Rugby, which began play in 2018 as the second attempt to launch a professional rugby union competition in the U.S., has a business structure identical to that of MLS. It is a single business entity, with each team owner-operator being a league shareholder, and all player contracts are held by the league. Also similar to MLS, MLR uses playing rules set by its sport's international governing body. However, MLR teams do not play competitive matches against teams from other leagues, and there is currently no cup competition in U.S. rugby similar to soccer's U.S. Open Cup. The MLR league structure also follows the North American model of one premier league without promotion and relegation. A more rarely seen business model in North America is the pure single-entity league, typified by the now-defunct XFL, where there are no individual owners or investors, with all teams centrally owned and operated by the league. Many upstart leagues begin their existence as pure single-entity leagues before they secure investors for teams (such as the NWHL) or are forced to operate in the pure single-entity model when investors fail to materialize (such as the Stars Football League). Many North American systems have a secondary or minor league but without promotion and relegation of teams between them. Often a minor league team is partly or wholly owned by a major league team, or affiliated with one, and utilized for player development. For example, Major League Baseball has an affiliation with Minor League Baseball. The minor clubs do not move up or down in the hierarchy by on-field success or failure. Professional ice hockey has a system somewhat similar to baseball's (without as many levels), while the National Basketball Association operates a single NBA G League. The National Football League does not have a minor league system as of 2011 but it has operated or affiliated with minor leagues in the 1930s, 1940s, 1960s, 1990s, and the early 2000s and invested in one in the late 2000s. To prevent conflicts of interest, most North American sports leagues that operate on the franchise system do not allow individual owners to hold more than one franchise at once. Most such leagues also use revenue sharing and a salary cap in an effort to maintain a level of parity between franchises. Structure of European leagues (Promotion and relegation system) Football in England developed a very different system from the North American one, and it has been adopted for football in most other European countries, as well as to many other sports founded in Europe and played across the world. The features of the system are: *The existence of an elected governing body to which clubs at all levels of the sport belong *The promotion of well-performing teams to higher-level leagues or divisions and the relegation of poorly performing teams to lower-level leagues or divisions. *Matches played both inside and outside of leagues European football clubs are members both of a league and of a governing body. In the case of England, all competitive football clubs are members of The Football Association, while the top 20 teams also are members of the Premier League, a separate organization. The 72 teams in the three levels below the Premier League are members of still another body, the English Football League. The FA operates the national football team and tournaments that involve teams from different leagues (except the EFL Cup, operated by the English Football League and open to its own teams and those in the Premier League). In conjunction with FIFA and other countries' governing bodies, it also sets the playing rules and the rules under which teams can sell players' contracts to other clubs. The rules or Laws of the Game are determined by the International Football Association Board.FIFA Regulations On The Status And Transfer Of Players The Premier League negotiates television contracts for its games. However, although the national league would be the dominating competition in which a club might participate, there are many non-league fixtures a club might play in a given year. In European football there are national cup competitions, which are single elimination knock-out tournaments, are played every year and all the clubs in the league participate. Also, the best performing clubs from the previous year may participate in pan-European tournaments such as the UEFA Champions League, operated by the Union of European Football Associations. A Premier League team might play a league game one week, and an FA Cup game against a team from a lower-level league the next, followed by an EFL Cup game against a team in the EFL, and then a fourth game might be against a team from across Europe in the Champions League. The promotion and relegation system is generally used to determine membership of leagues. Most commonly, a pre-determined number of teams that finish at the bottom of a league or division are automatically dropped down, or relegated, to a lower level for the next season. They are replaced by teams who are promoted from that lower tier either by finishing with the best records or by winning a playoff. In England, in the 2010‚Äì2011 season, the teams Birmingham City, Blackpool and West Ham United were relegated from the Premier League to the Football League Championship, the second level of English football. They were replaced by the top two teams from the second level, Queens Park Rangers and Norwich City, both of which won automatic promotion, as well as Swansea City (a Welsh club that plays in the English system), which won a playoff tournament of the teams that finished third through sixth. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, the teams Wolverhampton Wanderers, Blackburn, and Bolton were relegated to the Championship. They were replaced by Reading, Southampton, and West Ham. The two former teams had won automatic promotion, while the latter occupied the last promotion spot when they defeated Cardiff 5-0 on aggregate in the semifinals, and defeated Blackpool 2-1 at the final in Wembley Stadium. The system originated in England in 1888 when twelve clubs decided to create a professional Football League. It then expanded by merging with the Football Alliance in 1892, with the majority of the Alliance teams occupying the lower Second Division, due to the divergent strengths of the teams. As this differential was overcome over the next five years, the winners of the Second Division went into a playoff with the worst placed team in the First Division, and if they won, were promoted into the top tier. The first club to achieve promotion was Sheffield United, which replaced the relegated Accrington F.C. Relegation often has devastating financial consequences for club owners who not only lose TV, sponsorship and gate income but may also see the asset value of their shares in the club collapse. Some leagues offer a \\"parachute payment\\" to its relegated teams for the following years in order to protect them from bankruptcy. If a team is promoted back to the higher tier the following year then the parachute payment for the second season is distributed among the teams of the lower division.Article discussing the financial disparity between the Premier League and the Football League There is of course a corresponding bonanza for promoted clubs. The league does not choose which cities are to have teams in the top division. For example, Leeds, the fourth-biggest city in England, saw their team, Leeds United, relegated from the Premier League to the Championship in 2004, and went without top-flight football for 16 seasons before United returned to the Premier League in 2020. During this period, United were relegated again to the third-tier League One in 2007 and returned to the Championship in 2010. Any city that loses all of its Premier League clubs to relegation will continue to be without a club in the top league until a local club plays well enough to be promoted into the Premiership. Famously, the French Ligue 1 lacked a team from Paris, France's capital and largest city, for some years. Likewise, Berlin clubs in the Bundesliga have been rare, due to the richer clubs being all located in the former West Germany. As well as having no right to being in a certain tier, a club also has no territorial rights to its own area. A successful new team in a geographical location can come to dominate the incumbents. In Munich, for example, TSV 1860 M√ºnchen were initially more successful than the city's current biggest team Bayern M√ºnchen.Bundesliga history As of the current 2020‚Äì21 season, London has 12 teams in the top four league levels, including six Premier League teams. Clubs may be sold privately to new owners at any time, but this does not happen often where clubs are based on community membership and agreement. Such clubs require agreement from members who, unlike shareholders of corporations, have priorities other than money when it comes to their football club such as tradition or local identity. For similar reasons, relocation of clubs to other cities is very rare. This is mostly because virtually all cities and towns in Europe have a football club of some sort, the size and strength of the club usually relative to the town's size and importance. Buying an existing top- flight club and moving it to a new location is problematic, as the supporters of the town's original club are unlikely to switch allegiance to an interloper. This means anyone wanting ownership of a high ranked club in their native city must buy a local club as it stands and work it up through the divisions, usually by hiring better talent. There have been some cases where existing owners have chosen to relocate out of a difficult market, to better facilities, or simply to realize the market value of the land that the current stadium is built upon. As in the U.S., team relocations have been controversial as supporters of the club will protest at its loss. A rare example of a North American league that is attempting to develop a European- style model is the Canadian Premier League, which launched in 2019 as a purely domestic top-flight soccer league. The country's governing body sanctions the CPL as its top-level league despite the presence of three MLS teams in the country. Unlike other North American leagues, the CPL is operating on a club- based model. While it is now a single league, it plans to eventually adopt promotion and relegation. Systems around the world Leagues around the world generally follow one or the other of these systems with some variation. Most sport leagues in Australia are similar to the North American model, using post-season playoffs and no relegation, but without geographical divisions, with the most notable examples being the Australian Football League (Aussie rules) and National Rugby League (rugby league). Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan uses the North American system due to American influence on the game. In cricket, the Indian Premier League, launched in 2008, also operates on this system. The Super League, which is the top level of rugby league in the United Kingdom and France (also with a Canadian team), was run on a franchise basis from 2009 to 2014,Article discussing the potentially negative effects of franchising on Rugby League but returned to a promotion-relegation model with the 2015 season. Another example of a franchised league in European sport is ice hockey's Kontinental Hockey League, centered mainly in Russia with teams also located in Belarus, China, Finland, Kazakhstan, and Latvia. The promotion-relegation system is widely used in football around the world, notably in Africa and Latin America as well as Europe. The most notable variation has developed in Latin America where many countries have two league seasons per year, which scheduling allows because many Latin American nations lack a national cup competition. Another notable variation is the Brazilian system of two parallel league systems each with its own separate promotion and relegation, one national and another on state-level, the same teams play both leagues each year. The European model is also used in Europe even when the sports were founded in America, showing that the league system adopted is not determined by the sport itself, but more on the tradition of sports organization in that region. Sports such as basketball in Spain and Lithuania use promotion and relegation. In the same vein, the Australian A-League does not use the pyramid structure normally found in football, but instead follows the tradition of Australian sports having a franchise model and a post-season playoff system that better suits a country with a few important central locations where a sport needs to ensure there is a team playing with no risk of relegation. Likewise, the American franchise model is used by rugby union's Super Rugby, which features 15 non-European franchises. Thirteen are from the competition's founding countries of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, and the other two are teams from Argentina and Japan that joined the competition in 2016. In east Asia, places such as Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan have a particular differentiation among leagues: \\"European\\" sports such as football and rugby use promotion and relegation, while \\"American\\" sports such as baseball and basketball use franchising and minor leagues, with a few differences varying from country to country. A similar situation exists in countries in Central America and the Caribbean, where football and baseball share several close markets. Historical comparisons A major factor in the development of the North American closed membership system during the 19th Century was the distances between cities, with some teams separated by half of the North American continent, resulting in high traveling costs. When the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs was established in 1876, its founders judged that in order to prosper, they must make baseball's highest level of competition a \\"closed shop\\", with a strict limit on the number of teams, and with each member having exclusive local rights. This guarantee of a place in the league year after year would permit each club owner to monopolize fan bases in their respective exclusive territories and give them the confidence to invest in infrastructure, such as improved ballparks. This in turn would guarantee the revenues needed to support traveling across the continent.Cain, Louis P. and Haddock, David D.; 2005; 'Similar Economic Histories, Different Industrial Structures: Transatlantic Contrasts in the Evolution of Professional Sports Leagues'; Journal of Economic History 65 (4); pp 1116‚Äì1147 In contrast, the shorter distances between urban areas in England allowed more clubs to develop large fan bases without incurring the same travel costs as in North America. When The Football League, now known as the English Football League, was founded in 1888, it was not intended to be a rival of The Football Association but rather the top competition within it. The new league was not universally accepted as England's top-calibre competition right away. To help win fans of clubs outside The Football League, a system was established in which the worst teams at the end of each season would need to win re-election against any clubs wishing to join. A rival league, the Football Alliance, was then formed in 1889. When the two merged in 1892, it was not on equal terms; rather, most of the Alliance clubs were put in the new Football League Second Division, whose best teams would move up to the First Division in place of its worst teams. Another merger, with the top division of the Southern League in 1920, helped form the Third Division in similar fashion, firmly establishing the principle of promotion and relegation.

His conversion to Christianity came on October 28, 1646 (Julian calendar), when the missionary Reverend John Eliot preached his first sermon to Native Americans in their own language in Waban's large wigwam in Nonantum, Massachusetts, and Waban and many of his tribe were converted. Waban maintained close and friendly relations with the white settlers of Massachusetts and, in April 1675, reported to an English magistrate that trouble was brewing amongst the Wampanoags. Within two months, Waban's predictions came to pass when a Wampanoag named Metacomet, known as \\"King Philip,\\" led his nation in the initially successful King Philip's War. Metacomet's subsequent death in August 1676 signalled the end of the brief war, and the rebellion soon collapsed due to a lack of leadership. Nevertheless, Waban, falsely accused of being a conspirator, was imprisoned in October 1675. After a brief period of captivity, Waban was released in the spring of 1676 and returned to his settlement of Natick, Massachusetts. Waban is often considered to be tribal chief of the Nonantum tribe, but this is a misnomer.

It won the best deaf school in America in 2011 and 2014 History Indiana Institution for the Education of the Deaf, c. 1903 When the first school for the Deaf was established in Indiana, it was named Willard School, after the founder, William Willard.Gannon, Jack. 1981. Deaf Heritage‚ÄìA Narrative History of Deaf America, Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, p. 23 (PDF ) William Willard was a deaf teacher who taught at Ohio School for the Deaf in Columbus, Ohio. He traveled to Indianapolis in May 1843 to propose the establishment of a Deaf School. Once he had the support of the General Assembly, he recruited approximately twelve students. He and his wife, Eliza, were teachers. Eventually, the school had grown and a law which was passed in January 1846, officially established the Willard School as the sixth state school for the Deaf and the first Deaf school to provide free education to Deaf and hard of hearing students. The school had actually moved a few times in different locations, when finally, the school was built on an property on East 42nd Street. The name was changed to Indiana School for the Deaf. The school's main buildings on the current campus were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Academics ISD offers several programs ranging from infants to high school. They are as follows: Parent Infant Program, Preschool, Elementary, Middle School, and High School. The Parent Infant Program works closely with parents and their deaf or hard of hearing children from ages 0 to 3. When a student reaches 18 months of age, he or she can enroll at ISD as an official student. Preschool handles children up until Pre-Kindergarten. Elementary provides academics and activities for Kindergarten through 4thgrade students. Middle school hosts grades 5 to 8, and High School hosts grades 9 through 12. Residency ISD is also a residential school. It has dormitories where students reside throughout the week. Students arrive on Sundays and depart on Fridays. Dormitories are for students who live far enough not to be able to travel by bus every day to school. There are dormitories for male and female students: Preschool, Elementary, Middle School, and High School. ISD's residential programs offers extracurricular activities, peer interaction, student growth and development, achievement, and more. Athletics ISD offers several athletics starting from 5th grade to 12th grade.

Yamaguchi, otherwise known as in the matter of Marianne Wilson, or in the matter of Mary Ann Vaughn, is a highly complex decision in international family law which touches on questions in law still unresolved over fifty years later. The formal name of the action was Israel Karl-Gustav Eugene Lagerfelt v. Yamaguchi Masakatsu and Yamaguchi Hideko, or Case of Demand for Delivery of an Infant, No. Wa-154, 1956 Yokohama District Court (Yokohama Chiho-saiban-sho), initiated February 22, 1956. On December 5, 1956, it held that the defendants should deliver the infant to the plaintiff. The appeal was dismissed by Tokyo High Court (No. Ne-2824) on July 9, 1958.  Case  The case was brought by Consul Baron Karl-Gustav Lagerfelt on behalf of the King of Sweden as petitioner for guardianship of Mary Ann Vaughn, the daughter of a Swedish national in Japan, against the Yamaguchi family, de facto custodians of the eight-year-old child, to answer the questions of custody, guardianship and citizenship of Mary Ann Vaughn, also known as Marianne Wilson. The case was decided in Yokohama District Court in 1956, and sustained upon appeal by defendants to the Tokyo High Court in 1958. Defendants declined appeal to the Japanese Supreme Court, and custody was granted to the Swedish Crown. Mary Ann Vaughn, to be thenceforth known as Marianne Wilson, was granted Swedish citizenship and remained in the custody of the Swedish Ambassadors to Japan Tage Gr√∂nfall and later Frederick Almquist in Tokyo.  Parental history  Mary Ann Vaughn was born the only child of James A. Vaughn (b. May 7, 1925) and Vivienne Joy Wilson (b. November 2, 1929), in Bluff Hospital in Yokohama, Japan on April 17, 1949. Her father was a US national employed under contract with the United States Military Administration of Occupied Japan. Her mother was a Swedish National, of three generations of Swedish citizens resident in Japan. She was descended from John Wilson (Captain) and Sophia Wilson, n√©e Naka Yamazaki (great-grandparents) through their youngest son Professor John Wilson (grandfather).  Birth  Due to the sensitive nature of Vaughn's employment, the US Military Administration declined to allow Vaughn to marry under civil law at the US Embassy in Tokyo. Vaughn and Vivienne Wilson were married under religious ceremony in Yokohama, Japan on 8 May 1948. The Department of State declined Vaughn's request to allow his wife to immigrate to the United States, due to the absence of a licit civil license. During this time, Japan was under US Law as Occupied Japan. In addition, Japan had traditionally ignored the marriages of foreigners. As foreigners had no licit koseki, or Japanese family record, there was no method for registration of foreigner marriages within Japan. As Vaughn was a civilian employee of the United States, his marriage did not come under the terms of permissible immigration stipulated for US Military Service Personnel who married foreign women (see War-bride). Due to the absence of recognized civil marriage, James and Vivienne allegedly suffered harassment by US and Japanese authorities. Upon learning that his wife was pregnant, Vaughn returned to the United States to seek permission for immigration of his pregnant wife. He received assistance from Patrick McCarran, senator from Nevada, who sponsored private legislation permitting the immigration of Vivienne Joy Wilson to the United States for the purpose of legitimizing their marriage; and recognizing his daughter, Mary Ann Vaughn, who had been born in Yokohama during the interim, as his natural-born daughter. Private legislation was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law on 5 August 1950. (81st Congress 2nd Session, v.64 part 2, Chapter 596, Private Law 722, For the relief of Vivienne Joy Wilson and minor daughter Mary Ann Vaughn) However, Vivienne had been weakened by the privations of World War II, and contracted tuberculosis during James Vaughn's absence, during which Mary Ann was cared for by a nanny, Fumi. She died on 5 August 1950, the very day of passage of private legislation permitting her to immigrate to the United States.  Early life  After the death of her mother, Mary Ann Vaughn was placed under the guardianship of Professor John Wilson, with nanny Fumi Kaneko (later Fumi Yamaguchi) in custodial care. Due to the privations of the postwar period, John Wilson sailed to Sweden with his wife and children in 1952. Mary Ann was to accompany them, but due to an outbreak of whooping cough, she was to sail on the next ship. However, Yamaguchi absconded with Mary Ann, and Yamaguchi destroyed the child's records, raising her under claim of an abandoned American orphan in the slums of Yokohama. John Wilson continued to search for Mary Ann, and with the intervention of the AJCAJAO (American Joint Committee for Assisting Japanese-American Orphans), the Red Cross of Sweden and the International Red Cross, found and identified her in Yokohama in 1955. The AJCAJAO identified her residency with Masakatsu Yamaguchi and wife in Yokohama. The Consul of the Royal Swedish Legation attempted to negotiate a custody settlement with the Yamaguchi family, but was unsuccessful. The Crown then brought suit on behalf of Wilson for custody. According to Fumi Kaneko (reading from her interview in Asahi Shinbun and Shukan Shincho), the baby was entrusted to her by Vivian at her death bed. There was no mention of a search for the baby; instead Fumi Kaneko said she was the one who approached Swedish Embassy to recognize Mary Ann before she entered into grade school.  Public notoriety  The case developed intense national publicity in Japan, with a great national sympathy towards the Yamaguchi family, to remain as custodian, with publication in the Kanagawa Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun and Shukan Shincho Japanese periodicals, especially in the shukanshi, confrontational weekly magazines. The case attracted considerable attention from the Japanese Leftists, and became a focus of anti-American nationalism in Japan after World War II. The United States government abjured involvement in the case, not offering to enter as participant or amicus in the hearing.  Subsequent history  Mary Ann, now known as Marianne Wilson, remained in the custody of the Swedish Ambassador to Japan, and attended the ASIJ, the American School in Japan in Ch≈çfu, Tokyo ASIJ, graduating in the 1960s. She continued to visit the Yamaguchi family throughout their lifetime. She retained her Swedish citizenship, and relocated to Sweden, working for the Scandinavian Airlines System for a time, before returning to Japan to settle as a permanent resident Swedish citizen in Japan. She is married with one son, and lives in Tokyo. She remains in close contact with the John Wilson family of Sweden.

Plot summary Trapped in the stifling, small Irish town Baile na gCro√≠th, Elizabeth Egan had always been known as a serious woman, never laughing at jokes or taking joys from the simplest pleasure of life. This is due to having been abandoned by her free-spirited mother when she was young and was forced to grow up quickly to take care of her sister, Saoirse. Taking advantage of Elizabeth's sense of responsibility, Saoirse has led life with abandonment, and when she gives birth to a son, Luke, she leaves Elizabeth to take care of him. At the age of six, Luke claims to have a friend named Ivan whom Elizabeth cannot see. Though at first she is exasperated with this imaginary friend, she starts playing along with Luke when she learns that imaginary friends will only last about 3 months. Though invisible to most, Ivan is real. Only Luke can see him, though he comes to realise that Elizabeth can feel his presence. Knowing that only people who are in real need of a friend are able to see him, he follows Elizabeth around. When, suddenly, she is able to see him, Ivan is delighted, but disappointed just as quickly when she thinks him to be the father of one of Luke's friends. A friendship which soon turns into romance blossoms between them. Elizabeth meets Benjamin at work, and he asks her to dinner, but Ivan prevents her from going by inviting her out instead. Ivan's boss, Opal, sees his love for Elizabeth and tells him her own sad tale. She tells him that however much he wishes to be with Elizabeth a time will come when she will no longer be able to see him and will eventually age while he would remain young. However, Ivan is too much in love with Elizabeth and refuses to listen. To convince him, Opal takes him to see her own love, who has become an 80-year-old man while Opal has remained young. One day, when Elizabeth is hosting a party, she is no longer able to see Ivan for a while and he realises it is time to move on to a new friend. Ivan visits Elizabeth one last time while she sleeps, explaining why he has to go. Elisabeth thinks it was a dream. A few days later, Elizabeth realizes that it wasn't and that Ivan was Luke's 'imaginary' friend. They go their separate ways, and not only Elizabeth but Ivan as well are changed by the experience. Elizabeth is more relaxed and Ivan admits that Elizabeth has been by far his favorite friend...

For example, the string (enclosed by apostrophes) ' this is a test ' would be changed, after trimming, to 'this is a test' Variants Left or right trimming The most popular variants of the trim function strip only the beginning or end of the string. Typically named ltrim and rtrim respectively, or in the case of Python: lstrip and rstrip. C# uses TrimStart and TrimEnd, and Common Lisp string-left-trim and string-right-trim. Pascal and Java do not have these variants built-in, although Object Pascal (Delphi) has TrimLeft and TrimRight functions. Whitespace character list parameterization Many trim functions have an optional parameter to specify a list of characters to trim, instead of the default whitespace characters. For example, PHP and Python allow this optional parameter, while Pascal and Java do not. With Common Lisp's \`string-trim\` function, the parameter (called character-bag) is required. The C++ Boost library defines space characters according to locale, as well as offering variants with a predicate parameter (a functor) to select which characters are trimmed. Special empty string return value An uncommon variant of trim returns a special result if no characters remain after the trim operation. For example, Apache Jakarta's StringUtils has a function called \`stripToNull\` which returns \`null\` in place of an empty string. Space normalization Space normalization is a related string manipulation where in addition to removing surrounding whitespace, any sequence of whitespace characters within the string is replaced with a single space. Space normalization is performed by the function named \`Trim()\` in spreadsheet applications (including Excel, Calc, Gnumeric, and Google Docs), and by the \`normalize-space()\` function in XSLT and XPath, In-place trimming While most algorithms return a new (trimmed) string, some alter the original string in-place. Notably, the Boost library allows either in- place trimming or a trimmed copy to be returned. Definition of whitespace The characters which are considered whitespace varies between programming languages and implementations. For example, C traditionally only counts space, tab, line feed, and carriage return characters, while languages which support Unicode typically include all Unicode space characters. Some implementations also include ASCII control codes (non-printing characters) along with whitespace characters. Java's trim method considers ASCII spaces and control codes as whitespace, contrasting with the Java \`isWhitespace()\` method, which recognizes all Unicode space characters. Delphi's Trim function considers characters U+0000 (NULL) through U+0020 (SPACE) to be whitespace.  Non- space blanks  The Braille Patterns Unicode block contains , a Braille pattern with no dots raised. The Unicode standard explicitly states that it does not act as a space. The Non-breaking space can also be treated as non- space for trimming purposes.

It is stationed as a tenant unit at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. The wing directs the 3d Air Support Operations Group (3d ASOG) at Fort Hood, Texas (supporting III Corps), 18th Air Support Operations Group (18th ASOG) at Pope Field, North Carolina (supporting XVIII Airborne Corps of Fort Bragg), all Forward Air Control groups which arrange air support to ground forces. It also directs the 820th Base Defense Group (820th BDG), a Force Protection with an airborne capability, at Moody AFB, Georgia. Its 93d Operations Group is a successor organization to the World War II 93d Bombardment Group. It was the first VIII Bomber Command B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment group to carry out strategic bombardment operations against targets in Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany from RAF Alconbury, England on 9 October 1942. Active for over 60 years, the 93d Bombardment Wing was a component organization of Strategic Air Command's deterrent force during the Cold War, as a strategic bombardment wing. History : For additional history and lineage, see 93d Operations Group Strategic Air Command: B-29s, B-50s, and B-47s Emblem of the 93d Bombardment Wing On 28 July 1947, the 93d Bombardment Wing, (Very Heavy) was established and maintained combat readiness for global strategic bombardment, flying the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The wing was later redesignated as the 93d Bombardment Wing (Medium) as it was not chosen to be reequipped with the Convair B-36 Peacemaker, but remained with the B-29. In 1949, the wing received its first B-50 Superfortress aircraft, an improved version of the B-29. It began operations overseas with the deployment of its tactical force to RAF Mildenhall, England (July 1950 ‚Äì January 1951) in response to communist aggression on the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, the 93d Air Refueling Squadron was activated on 1 March 1949, equipped with the KB-29P (a B-29 bomber modified with a refueling boom). The wing continued to move forward throughout the 1950s, replacing the propeller-driven B-50s with new B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. It flew numerous training missions and participated in various SAC exercises and deployments with the Stratojet Strategic Air Command: B-52s Three B-52Bs of the 93d Bomb Wing prepare to depart Castle Air Force Base, Calif., for their record-setting round-the-world flight in 1957 A B-52D drops 500 pound bombs SAC assigned its first Boeing B-52 Stratofortress to the wing in June 1955.Knaack, p. 237This aircraft, serial 52-8711 was retired in 1965 and put on display at the Aerospace Museum at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Knaack, p. 243 The wing was redesignated the 93d Bombardment Wing, Heavy on 1 February 1955 in anticipation of the arrival of the B-52. Its B-52Bs were initially used for crew training. The wing was declared combat ready with the B-52 on 12 March 1956, but became nonoperational two months later when a second squadron began to equip with Stratofortresses. It became operational again on 26 June 1957, when its mission became primarily crew training. The wing retained some of its B-47s until 1956 for crew training purposes. It was one of the few wings to have operated both jet bombers simultaneously. In 1956, the wing's three bombardment squadrons ‚Äì 328th, 329th and 330th began receiving the new B-52D. The following year, they began receiving the B-52E model, while some B-52Bs remained with the 93 BW until well into the 1960s. On 24 and 25 November 1956, in an operation known as Quick Kick, four B-52Bs of the 93d joined four B-52Cs of the 42d Bombardment Wing for a nonstop flight around the perimeter of North America. Four in-flight refuelings by Boeing KC-97 Stratotankers were required for the journey.SAC was quick to point out that five to six hours could have been shaved off the flight time, if it had jet KC-135 Stratotankers instead of propellor driven KC-97s to refuel the bombers. Knaack, p. 244. Less than two months later, in Operation Power Flight, three 93d B-52Bs flew the first non-stop jet around-the-world flight. Taking off on 16 January 1957,Knaack, p. 244 they flew via Newfoundland, Casablanca, Dhahran, Ceylon, the Malay Peninsula, Manila and Guam. Upon landing at March Air Force Base, California on 18 January, General Curtis LeMay, SAC Commander, greeted the crews and presented them with the Distinguished Flying Cross. Operation Power Flight was recognized by the National Aeronautical Association as the outstanding flight of 1957 and it awarded the wing the Mackay Trophy. It was assigned the Boeing KC-135A Stratotanker in January 1957, making it the first SAC bomb wing to receive the new aircraft. In June 1958, the wing received six B-52Fs, making it the first to fly this series of the Stratofortress.Knaack, p. 266 Throughout the height of the Vietnam War (1968‚Äì1974) the wing operated a special B-52 aircrew replacement training unit to support SAC's B-52 operations in Southeast Asia. The wing recorded another first on 10 June 1982 when the first all female KC-135 crew, \\"Fair Force One\\", flew a five-hour training sortie. Finally in August 1990 the wing found itself back at war. At home its support units operated an aerial port of embarkation for personnel and equipment deploying to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield. Overseas, its KC-135s refueled planes and ferried personnel and equipment to the region, while its B-52s bombed the Iraqi Republican Guard and targeted Iraqi infrastructure throughout January and February 1991. The Air Force underwent major restructuring after the Cold War ended. On 1 September 1991, the 93d lost its air refueling commitment, (924th ARS), and its KC-135 aircrew training missions (329th CCTS). It also implemented the objective wing organization and was redesignated as the 93d Wing. On 1 June 1992 the 93d was relieved from assignment to SAC and was reassigned to the newly formed Air Combat Command (ACC). It was then redesignated as the 93d Bomb Wing. Shortly afterwards it was announced that Castle AFB would close, under the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) process. The 322d Bomb Squadron was inactivated 3 May 1994, and the wing became non-operational. The wing however continued to supervise the closure of Castle AFB, and was inactivated on 30 September 1995 with the closure of the base. Strategic Air Command: B-52 crew training When the first B-52s began to be assigned to SAC in 1955, Air Training Command had no school for the aircraft. Because of the need to get the bomber operational as soon as possible, SAC established the 4017th Combat Crew Training Squadron to conduct training on the Stratofortress. As the B-52 force expanded, the mission became too great for a single squadron and the wing's three bombardment squadrons took over the flight training program, while the 4017th conducted ground training and overall administration of the training program. As SAC's involvement in the Vietnam War increased, on 15 April 1968, SAC established a replacement training unit within the 4017th. This unit was established to qualify aircrews flying B-52E, B-52F, B-52G and B-52H bombers to fly the B-52D, which (with its Big Belly modification) was SAC's conventional bomber in Southeast Asia. After two weeks of training, the crews augmented the cadre unit in the Pacific. This training enabled SAC to meet its commitments, while at the same time spreading the burden of deployment more equitably among its entire force of B-52 crews.Knaack, p. 256 Joint STARS from 1996 93d Air Surveillance and Air Control Wing emblem An E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System from the 93d Air Control Wing flies a refueling mission over the skies of Georgia. While The 93d Wing had been inactivated in September 1995, the wing's history was too valuable, and Air Force leadership decided that it would rise in another guise. Just four months later it was redesignated as the 93d Air Control Wing (93 ACW), and was reactivated at Robins AFB, Georgia, on 29 January 1996. It was to be equipped with the Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System), and it accepted its first production aircraft on 11 June 1996. From late October through December 1996, the wing deployed to Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany for Operation Joint Endeavor and Operation Joint Guard, both in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It provided \\"top cover\\" for United Nations (UN) peacekeeping forces and monitored the warring factions for violations of UN resolutions. This deployment actually occurred before the wing had been declared as \\"Initial Operational Capable\\" by Air Combat Command, which took place on 18 December 1997. As U.S. pressure on Iraq heightened in 1998, the 93d deployed an element to the Middle East to monitor Iraqi military movements. In February 1999 it deployed an aircraft to Europe to support NATO's monitoring of tensions between Serbia and Kosovo. The new wing saw its first combat during Operation Allied Force over Kosovo and Serbia, playing a major role in the destruction of enemy targets and compiling over 1,000 combat hours. From November 2001 to April 2002, the wing deployed as part of Operation Enduring Freedom after the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States. The wing inactivated at Robins AFB on 30 September 2002. Its mission and resources became a part of Air Force history on that day as the Georgia Air National Guard's 116th Bomb Wing (now redesignated the 116th Air Control Wing (116th ACW)) assumed command responsibility for the Joint STARS mission and the first ever \\"blended wing\\", combining active-duty and Air National Guard personnel, aircraft, and facilities under one commander under the newly activated 116th ACW.  93d Air Ground Operations Wing  The 93d Air Ground Operations Wing (93 AGOW) is a non-flying active support wing activated on 25 January 2008. The 93d's mission is to manage and providing combat-ready tactical air control party personnel, battlefield weather, and force protection assets for joint forces commanders. The wing is based at Moody AFB, Georgia.

The teleplay was written by Terence Winter from a story idea by Winter and Tim Van Patten. It was the first of four episodes for the series directed by Steve Buscemi and originally aired on May 6, 2001. Starring * James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano * Lorraine Bracco as Dr. Jennifer Melfi * Edie Falco as Carmela Soprano * Michael Imperioli as Christopher Moltisanti * Dominic Chianese as Corrado Soprano, Jr. * Steven Van Zandt as Silvio Dante * Tony Sirico as Paulie Gualtieri * Jamie-Lynn Sigler as Meadow Soprano * Robert Iler as Anthony Soprano, Jr. * Drea de Matteo as Adriana La Cerva  Aida Turturro as Janice Soprano  Steven R. Schirripa as Bobby Baccalieri * = credit only Guest starring * Tom Aldredge as Hugh De Angelis * Vitali Baganov as Valery * Jason Cerbone as Jackie Aprile, Jr. * Oksana Lada as Irina Peltsin * Annabella Sciorra as Gloria Trillo * Suzanne Shepherd as Mary De Angelis * Frank Ciornei as Slava Malevsky Synopsis Jackie is with Meadow in her room but she has a cold and explains she cannot have sex. Jackie looks at his watch, says he is tired, and leaves. The next night he makes a feeble excuse for not seeing her. A friend drives Meadow to Jackie's place. He comes out with another girl. Meadow gets out of the car and tells him they are finished. She and her friend then drive away, the other girl walks off, and Jackie is left alone. Gloria comes back from Morocco and goes to meet Tony on his boat. She picks a quarrel and storms out, leaving him baffled. They reconcile, and have lunchtime sex in a hotel. She invites him for dinner in her house that night but, delayed by family obligations, he arrives very late. She is bitterly hurt and angry, but they reconcile again and have sex, and she cooks dinner again. Then, just before eating, he receives a phone call and has to leave on urgent business. She says, \\"I hate you!\\", throws his dinner‚Äîa steak‚Äîat him, and trashes her dining room after he goes. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he is seeing Gloria. In the first session he speaks of how happy they are together; in the second he complains of her changing moods. Melfi says Gloria is depressive, unstable, and impossible to please. \\"Does that remind you of any other woman?\\" Tony instructs Paulie to make a collection from Valery, a Russian, on behalf of Silvio, who is ill. He goes there with Christopher. Though it is early, Valery is drunk. Paulie needlessly provokes him and there is a fight. Though drunk, Valery fights skilfully but the other two get on top of him and Paulie throttles him with a floor lamp. Shocked at what they have done, they wrap him in a carpet and wheel him out to their car. Paulie suggests that they dump him somewhere in the Pine Barrens. He calls Tony but this call and others later are hampered by poor reception and static. Slava, who launders Tony's money, tells him that he and Valery, a trained commando, are closer than brothers. In the snow-covered woods, Paulie and Chris park and open the trunk: Valery is still alive. They walk him some distance, give him a shovel, and make him dig his own grave. Choosing his moment, Valery hits them both hard with the shovel and flees. They chase him, shooting. Paulie thinks he has shot him in the head but he keeps running, and goes out of sight. They find his track, but it suddenly ends: Valery has vanished. After a time, Paulie and Chris realize they are lost. Paulie slips down a slope and loses a shoe. Long after nightfall, faint with cold and hunger, they find an abandoned van where they take refuge. Light-headed, they blame each other for what has happened; Chris says Paulie intends to choke him while he is asleep. They fight, Chris pulls a gun on Paulie, then breaks down in crazy laughter. They agree to stay together. In the middle of the night Paulie calls Tony (who receives the call in Gloria's house), manages to tell him where they parked the car, and pleads for help. Tony drives out with Bobby, a skilled outdoorsman. They reach the parking-spot: Paulie's car has vanished. They wait until dawn to look for Paulie and Chris, who have left the van and are walking in a random direction. Paulie's makeshift shoe falls off, and he shoots it in a fit of crazed frustration. Tony and Bobby hear the shots and head toward their source; the pairs soon meet up with one another. Paulie gives a false version of what caused the fight with Valery, and Chris backs him up. The money they collected was in the car. Tony stresses to Paulie that if Valery ever turns up again, it will be his responsibility. They head back to north Jersey in silence; only Bobby has peace of mind. Valery's fate Shortly after Valery escapes into the Pine Barrens, Paulie shoots him, apparently in the head, but he still vanishes. The camera shifts away from Paulie and Christopher to an aerial viewpoint, suggesting that Valery was watching them from a tree. In addition, Paulie's car is missing when they return. Valery was never seen again. Series creator David Chase has said that he never intended to have Valery return and that the story is richer and more realistic with some mystery to the plot. HBO listed Valery as \\"Deceased?\\" in promotional materials. On the fate of Valery, Terence Winter said: David Chase said: In 2008 Chase said in an interview at the Actors Guild: In an interview with Sam Roberts, Chase said: Discussing the episode in a June 10, 2007 New York Times article titled \\"One Final Whack at That HBO Mob\\", Imperioli depicted the lack of closure regarding Valery as an example of the series' overall subversiveness: In the same article, Sirico said that Chase wrote a sixth-season scene where Christopher and Paulie chanced upon Valery outside a bar and promptly shot him to death but it was removed from the script, possibly by Chase: Title reference * The Pine Barrens is a protected wilderness area managed by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission in Southern New Jersey. This is where Christopher and Paulie try to \\"dispose\\" of what they assume is Valery's body. Cultural references * Paulie likens Valery to Rasputin, who was notoriously difficult to kill. * When Paulie is tying on his makeshift shoe, Chris ironically likens him to Bruno Magli, the name of an Italian luxury shoe company. * When Chris and Paulie are in the van, Chris remarks that Valery is trained and that it is like Die Hard. Production * Director Tim Van Patten had dreamed about the idea of Paulie and Christopher getting lost in the woods during the production of season 2, and after discussing it with writer Terence Winter, presented the concept to David Chase who worked it into season 3. * The forest scenes for the episode were filmed at Harriman State Park in New York, after the production team was denied a permit to film in New Jersey at the South Mountain Reservation. Essex County executive James Treffinger said The Sopranos \\"depicts an ethnic group in stereotypical fashion\\". Treffinger was later convicted and imprisoned for corruption. This is a fairly rare instance where the show did not depict an environment similar to the one suggested, as neither Harriman State Park nor South Mountain Reservation are ecologically or visually similar to the New Jersey Pine Barrens. * There was an unexpected snowfall just before the shoot. Both the cast and the crew agreed that the snow added to the emotional effect of the episode. * The interior of the truck was shot on a sound stage. The actors' freezing \\"breath\\" was added in CGI.The Sopranos: The Complete Third Season, DVD commentary * Director Steve Buscemi successfully threw the steak at James Gandolfini's head in the scene of Tony's argument with Gloria Trillo; neither Annabella Sciorra nor the prop handlers had been able to hit Gandolfini.The Sopranos: The Complete Third Season DVD commentary * \\"Pine Barrens\\" took 12 days for shooting, setting a record for the longest episode shoot in The Sopranos at the time. * The HBO documentary James Gandolfini: Tribute to a Friend (2013) includes an anecdote by Steve Schirripa about the shooting of the scene where Tony picks Bobby up at Junior's house. When they were shooting Tony's reaction to Bobby's hunting outfit, Schirripa surprised Gandolfini by entering the kitchen wearing a strap-on dildo. Tony's response and laughter, pointing at Bobby and then doubling over the sink, is the take of Gandolfini seeing the strap-on. Music * The song played during the opening scene, where Gloria arrives at the docks, is Them's \\"Gloria\\". * The music video A.J. is watching on the living room television is \\"Coffee & TV\\" by Blur. * The song played during the final montage/closing credits is the aria \\"Sposa son disprezzata\\" (\\"I am wife and I am scorned\\") from the opera La Merope by Geminiano Giacomelli, sung by Cecilia Bartoli. This is the same music that opens the next episode, \\"Amour Fou\\". Accolades * Time and Entertainment Weekly consider this to be one of the best episodes in The Sopranos series, due largely to the offbeat and dark comedy between Paulie and Christopher.Time: The Best of the SopranosEW: The all-time 10 best \\"Sopranos\\" episodes * Former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg lists this episode as his favorite in an interview with the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet.Dagbladet: - Har du en yndlingsepisode i Sopranos? * In his acceptance speech for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, Alan Taylor thanks Steve Buscemi for his work on \\"Pine Barrens.\\" * For its 65th anniversary, TV Guide picked this as the fourth-best episode of the 21st century. *Terence Winter and Tim Van Patten received the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Drama for their work on this episode.

History It was mined in March 1978. The diamond was purchased by Mouw Diamond Cutting in Johannesburg in partnership with William Goldberg of New York City. The diamond was marked for bisection by Rose Mouw, the spouse of Jacob Mouw, the founder of Mouw Diamond Cutting. Cutting Frans Swanepoel was responsible for the sawing of the diamond and the cleaving of the lesser half of the diamond was done by Sylvain Mouw and Jacques Mouw. The polishing of the two main diamonds of 137.02 (Big Rose) and 31.48 (Little Rose) ct. was done by David du Plessis (who was also responsible for polishing The Golden Jubilee and was one of the main polishers of the Centenary Diamond), and the . (Baby Rose) was done by Mike Botha and Willem Joubert. The stones resulting from the original stone have been named the Premier Rose family, with the largest retaining the name of Premier Rose Diamond. The Premier Rose collection ranks among the finest polished gems in the world and became the benchmark in symmetry and proportions for large fancy cut diamonds. Name The diamond was subsequently named after the Premier mine and Rose Mouw, hence the name Premier Rose. Details This diamond had some inclusions, yet it was an unmistakably colourless gem. The diamond did not display a definite crystallographic habit and was often incorrectly referred to as a 'cleavage piece'. If a resin model of the diamond is studied however, one would find no evidence of mechanical or natural cleavage on the diamond. The morphology of this diamond was due to plastic deformation during the eruption phase of the kimberlite. The diamond did not exhibit any trigons on the octahedral faces (111) or noticeable striae on the dodecahedral faces (110) and the crystallographic orientation was derived from the presence of two orthogonal inversions on one of the hexahedral faces (100).

World War II In 1939 he won the national aerial aerobatics contest with his B√º 133 Jungmeister and in 1941 was named chief pilot of the Romanian national air transport company LARES. Even though this was a comfortable job, he managed to get in the front line as a fighter pilot in the 53rd Fighter Squadron (equipped with Hurricane Mk. I). After the capture of Odessa, the Romanian Army reduced the number of front line troops and he was one of the reservists who were sent home. He took up his position at LARES. However he managed to arrange a return to active duty in 1943. On 26 April 1943 he was remobilized and assigned to the 7th Fighter Group, which was equipped with the new Messerschmitt Bf 109. On 5 May he arrived on the front line and was named commander of the 58th Fighter Squadron. On 29 June, he and his wingman engaged four Yakolevs, two La-5s and four Spitfires, while trying to protect three Romanian Ju 88 bombers. His wingman was badly hit and forced to return to base. He continued the fight on his own and shot down two Spitfires. His aircraft was damaged, but managed to escape and make a belly landing. Two of the bombers were destroyed. In July he flew both day and night missions, even though his aircraft was not equipped for low-visibility flying. Cantacuzino tried to stop the Soviet night bombings of his airfield. The Germans protested, considered him a little mad, so he eventually gave up the night missions. On 27 July 1943, he shot down the Soviet Air Forces' flying ace Nikolay F. Khimushin (12 kills). Between 2 and 5 August he shot down nine aircraft (four Yaks and five Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft), raising his score to 27. On 5 August he was alone on patrol and he encountered a Soviet formation about 40‚Äì50 planes strong (Il-2s and Yaks). He realized that he could not destroy them all, but felt he could inflict some damage on the formation. He dove into the Il-2 formation and shot down two of them before he was attacked by the Soviet fighters. He managed to shake them off and shoot down one. The day of 16 August was an excellent day for the pilots of the 7th Fighter Group. They scored 22 confirmed kills and five probables, with Cantacuzino shooting down three (two La-5s and an Il-2). On 28 August he received the Iron Cross, 1st class. In the autumn of 1943 Cantacuzino became ill and was interned in a hospital and was kept from the front so he could rest and recuperate. On 10 February 1944 he returned to active duty in the 7th Fighter Group, which was sent to the front with the Soviets in Moldova. On 15 April, there was a USAAF raid and Cantacuzino and his wingmen attacked the bomber formations and shot down six B-24 Liberators (the prince got one himself). He continued flying missions against the Soviet Air Force and scored several victories. In August 1944, Cantacuzino became the commander of the 9th Fighter Group, succeeding Captain Alexandru ≈ûerbƒÉnescu, who was shot down in combat with US fighters on August 18. After 23 August 1944, when Romania quit the Axis, the Luftwaffe started bombing Bucharest from airfields close to the capital which were still in German hands. The remains of the 7th and 9th Fighter Groups were brought in to protect the capital. Cantacuzino shot down 3 Heinkel He 111s on this occasion. Cantacuzino was then given a special mission: to transport Lieutenant-Colonel James Gunn III, the highest ranking American prisoner-of-war in Romania, to the airbase at Foggia and return to Romania with 56 B-17s converted for transport duty to airlift 1,274 U.S. PoWs. He returned flying a P-51 Mustang because his Bf 109 could not be refueled. He needed only one flight to become familiar with the new aircraft and dazzled the Americans with his aerobatics. On 25 February 1945, piloted his Messerschmidte Bf 109G, he shot down one FW 190 piloted by Hermann Heim. This occurred about 3 km from Zvolenska Slatina in Czechoslovakia. Cantacuzino was credited with 43 aerial victories (one shared) and 11 unconfirmed. According to the counting system used through much of the war, his kill total was 69, the highest in the Romanian Air Force. After World War II After the war ended, Cantacuzino was demobilized and returned to LARES. The USSR imposed a communist regime that confiscated private property and began imprisoning the old elite and opponents of the regime. Cantacuzino lost all his land and soon his wife left him. In 1946 he married Nadia Gray. He managed to escape to Italy in 1947 and then he settled in Spain. There he was helped by the Romanian community to buy himself an airplane, in order to earn his living at air shows. Personal life Cantacuzino was born in Bucharest. His father was Mihai Cantacuzino and his mother Maria Tescanu Rosetti later known as Maruca Cantacuzino; they were both from old Romanian noble families. After his father died, Maria Rosetti married for a second time, to George Enescu (Romania's greatest composer and a world class violinist). Constantin Cantacuzino went to high-school in Bucharest. He loved motor sports and he could afford to practice them all the time. He was an excellent motor bike racer, winning several races, and driver. He set a new record on the Paris-Bucharest race. He also played tennis and was the captain of the Romanian ice hockey team at the World Championships in 1931 and 1933. He was the father of novelist Oana Orlea.

In the spring of 1942 he was assigned as a pilot to the 7th Fighter Group, Tudor, p. 14 which fought with the German forces against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, including at the Battle of Stalingrad. He flew mostly IAR-80 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. Early military career ≈ûerbƒÉnescu graduated from the Military College at T√¢rgovi»ôte and the Infantry Officers School at Sibiu in 1933. Soon after, he was appointed commander of the 3rd Mountain Troops battalion, located at Bra»ôov. In 1942, he joined the Air Force Flight School in Ghimbav and became a fighter pilot within the 7th Fighter Group. Eastern front The 7th Fighter Group was detached in 1942 to the Stalingrad front. »òerbƒÉnescu distinguished himself in the fierce battles during the retreat from the airfields around Stalingrad. When the Red Army broke the German and Romanian defenses in November 1942 and approached the Romanian airfield where the 7th Fighter Group was stationed, »òerbƒÉnescu successfully organized the defense of the airbase against the Soviet forces, helped by his infantry experience. He had at his disposal only two anti-aircraft guns (one Rheinmetall 37mm and one 75mm Vickers-Re»ôi»õa gun), the 20mm guns on the Bf 109Es and a company of ill-equipped and trained soldiers. The Romanians' camouflaged positions and well-led defense stopped the Soviet tanks attacking the airfield for two days. The Bf 109's 20 mm guns were used as antitank weapons on the ground (by lifting the airplane's tail on barrels), this being a unique case of airplane-tank duel. On November 23, 1942, the Romanian troops evacuated eight Bf 109E (another 3 were lost while they tried to take off under fire). Each airplane carried two or three people in the cockpit. After this, what remained of »òerbƒÉnescu's unit was stationed on the Morozovskaya airfield and was soon withdrawn to Romania for rest and recuperation.

Back to Romania ≈ûerbƒÉnescu and Ioan Dicezare, August 30, 1943 On March 29, 1943, »òerbƒÉnescu was appointed commander of the 57th Fighter Squadron, equipped with the new Messerschmitt Bf 109G, and promoted to the rank of Captain. Between June and August 1943 he shot down 28 Allied aircraft, and received the highest Romanian military decoration, Order of Michael the Brave, 3rd Class. On October 23, the 9th Fighter Group replaced the battle- exhausted 7th Fighter Group, but »òerbƒÉnescu and the other aces remained. He kept fighting and shooting down airplanes of the Allies and, as a result, he was named the Group's commander on February 13, 1944. In May 1944 the Red Army entered Romania and occupied northern Bessarabia and northern Moldavia, but they were stopped after some fierce fighting (see also: Battle of T√¢rgul Frumos), in which the pilots also played a very important role. On June 11, »òerbƒÉnescu shot down his first USAAF aircraft, a B-17 Flying Fortress, his 45th victory. This was followed by two Allied P-51 Mustangs shot down on July 31 and on August 4 respectively, which were his last kills. Alexandru »òerbƒÉnescu Foundation, January 10, 2008. Retrieved on 21 February 2008. Death On August 18, 1944, Alexandru »òerbƒÉnescu took off on his last mission. On that day, he and his twelve wingmen, together with twelve other fighters from the 9th Fighter Group, attacked a swarm of Mustangs and Lightnings. When Lieutenant Dobran and Adjutant D√¢rjan tried to clear his tail, it was too late. His last words were: \\"I'm going down...\\". Apparently his radio was not functioning properly and he could not hear his wingmen's warnings. Following »òerbƒÉnescu's death, all Romanian fighters were issued orders to refrain from engaging the Americans until a new strategy would be adopted. Five days later, on August 23, 1944, a coup d'√©tat led by King Michael of Romania deposed Marshal Ion Antonescu and Romania switched to the Allied side. During his entire piloting career, »òerbƒÉnescu was credited with 47 confirmed victories (and 8 probable) in aerial combat which, with eight unconfirmed, yielded 55 points in the Romanian scoring system, second only to Constantin Cantacuzino with 69. Legacy Today, a boulevard in Bucharest bears his name and passes very close to Aurel Vlaicu Airport. Each year, on 18 August, veterans, air force officers and aviation enthusiasts gather at his tomb to commemorate him.

Background George Pappajohn put his house up for sale through a real-estate company. He met with a female real-estate agent from the company at a bar. They had lunch together, including drinks, over the course of approximately three hours, after which the two went to Pappajohn's house where they engaged in sexual intercourse. The agent claimed that she was raped. However, Pappajohn claims that short of a few coy objections she had consented. After the event the woman was seen running out the house naked, wearing a bow-tie, with her hands bound, and was in great distress. During the trial the issue arose of whether the defence of mistake of fact should be put to the jury. Namely, whether Pappajohn should be able to claim that he mistakenly believed that she had consented. The trial judge refused to allow the defence and Pappajohn was convicted. Opinion of the Court The majority opinion was written by Justice McIntyre. He first discussed the question of when a defence should be put to a jury. He held that a defence should be used when there is \\"some evidence which would convey a sense of reality in the submission.\\" On the facts, he found that there was no evidence, other than the statement of the accused, that if believed, would have allowed for the possibility of consent. Accordingly, the lower court ruling was upheld. Justice Dickson took a different approach to the defence of mistake of fact. He stated that the defence was derived from the mens rea requirement, which is a subjective standard, and consequently the mistaken belief did not need to be reasonable. Aftermath The federal government later amended the criminal offence to require that the jury should \\"consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.\\" Sec 265(4). http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII-gb:s_264_1 The Supreme Court itself clarified the law in the case of R. v. Sansregret (generally indexed as Sansregret v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570), where it excluded the defense of mistake of fact where the defendant is found to be \\"wilfully blind\\" http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1985/1985scr1-570/1985scr1-570.htm.

Nicknamed \\"Dixie\\" Academy, the tradition of white-washing the name \\"DIXIE\\" on a sandstone rock formation overlooking the St. George valley (the Sugarloaf) began in 1913. In 1963 the Dixie Academy split into Dixie High School and Dixie College (which became the Dixie State University of Utah in 2000). Dixie High transitioned to a new building in the early 2000s. Construction began in 2001 with a new arts department wing that featured an auditorium and choir and band rooms. The main, three-story school building was constructed in an adjacent parking lot. In 2004 the student body moved to the new building, and the majority of the old building was torn down (one classroom remains for use as auto-tech classes). Construction was completed before the 2005-2006 school year with a new gym and water feature. The 2010-2011 school year marked the 100th year of the school.

He was considered the foremost British authority of German studies. Pasley is particularly well known for his dedication to and publication of the works of Franz Kafka. Biography Early life Born in Rajkot, India, Pasley was educated at Sherborne. He was a direct descendant of Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley, 1st Baronet, who distinguished himself in the French Revolutionary Wars and was made a baronet in 1794. 1944‚Äì1946 he served in the Royal Navy.The Telegraph obituary Academics and honors Following is the outline of the academic career of Sir Malcolm Pasley:Jeremy Adler, Obituary The Independent (London), 26 March 2004 *1947: Attended Trinity College, Oxford *1949: Graduated with a First in Modern Languages *1949-50: Laming Travelling Fellow at The Queen's College, Oxford *1950-58: Appointed Lecturer in German at Brasenose and Magdalen Colleges (University of Oxford) *1958-86: Emeritus Fellow, Magdalen College *1979-80: Vice-President, Magdalen College *1980: Honorary doctorate from the University of Giessen *1982: Succeeded to the family baronetcy *1983: Elected to the German Academy of Language and Literature in Darmstadt *1986: Retired *1987: Austrian Cross of Honour for Learning and the Arts *1991: Fellowship of the British Academy Marriage and children Sir Malcolm Pasley was married in 1965 to Virginia Wait they had two sons: * Robert Killigrew Sabine Pasley, born 25 October 1965 * Humphrey Sabine Pasley, born 1967 German language Pasley wrote of many German authors, with his initial works on the German language, Nietzsche in particular, gaining him much fame. Pasley's work in this area was pioneering; his book Germany: A Companion to German Studies, first published in 1972, is still in heavy demand. Kafka Pasley is best known for his work on the Kafka writings. He began studying Kafka in the early part of his career and was introduced to Marianne Steiner born Pollak, Kafka's niece and daughter of his sister Valli, by her son Michael, who was a student at Oxford. Through this friendship Pasley became the key adviser to Kafka's heirs. Pasley regarded Kafka as \\"a younger brother\\". In 1956, Salman Schocken and Max Brod placed Kafka's works in a Swiss vault due to concerns surrounding unrest in the Middle East and the safety of the manuscripts, which were with Brod in Tel Aviv. After significant negotiation, Pasley took personal possession of Kafka's works that were in Brod's possession. In 1961, Pasley transported them by car from Switzerland to Oxford. Pasley reflected on the adventure as one that \\"made his own hair stand on end\\". The papers, except The Trial, were deposited in Oxford's Bodleian Library. The Trial remained in the possession of Brod heiress Ilse Ester Hoffe, and in November 1988 the German Literary Archives at Marbach, Germany purchased the manuscript for ¬£1.1 million in an auction conducted by Sotheby's.The Trial, Franz Kafka, Schocken Book, 1998, Publisher's Note page xiii\\"Scholars squabble in Kafkaesque drama\\", Von David Harrison, The Observer, 17 May 1998, S. 23 At Oxford, Pasley headed a team of scholars (Gerhard Neumann, Jost Schillemeit, and J√ºrgen Born) that recompiled the text, removed Max Brod's edits and changes, and began publishing the works in 1982. This team restored the original German text to its full (and in some cases incomplete) state, with special attention paid to the unique Kafka punctuation, considered to be critical to his style.Jeremy Adler, \\"Stepping into Kafka‚Äôs head\\", Times Literary Supplement, 13 October 1995 Criticism of Pasley's work on Kafka Subsequent to the publication of the Kafka works, Pasley began receiving criticism about the completeness of their German publication. To that end, Stroemfeld Verlag has requested permission to scan the manuscripts to produce a facsimile edition and CD-ROM. Aside from completeness, they cited a concern for the preservation of the works; some were written in pencil, and many were fading and crumbling. Pasley refused their requests. He is joined by Marianne Steiner, who in 1998, told The Observer \\"I cannot forgive them for [the terrible things they had said about Pasley]. I do not want them to have anything to do with the manuscripts.\\" In April 1998, Stroemfeld published a facsimile version of The Trial. This manuscript, being owned by the German government, was accessible to them. In this publication the manuscript and transcription are listed side by side. Scholars in favor of the Stroemfeld editions include Jeremy Adler, professor of German at King's College London, American writers Louis Begley and Harold Bloom, professor of Humanities at Yale.

The Pamlico Talk Like A Tarheel , from the North Carolina Collection's website at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Retrieved 2013-02-05. River is a tidal river that flows into Pamlico Sound, in North Carolina in the United States. It is formed by the confluence of the Tar River and Tranters Creek. The historic Tuscarora tribe, an Iroquoian-language group originally from western New York, had been well established in North Carolina, including along the Pamlico River, before European contact. The encroachment of settlers and their selling Tuscarora into slavery increased tensions between the groups. These led to the Tuscarora War (1711-1715), in which the Tuscarora led by Chief Hancock were defeated. Most Tuscarora migrated to New York, where they were sponsored by the Oneida and by 1722 were admitted to the Iroquois Confederacy as the Sixth Nation. Most of the survivors in North Carolina were removed to a reservation in Bertie County, North Carolina in 1718. Since European contact, they had lost much population due to lack of immunity to new infectious diseases, followed by the casualties of war. English, Irish, and Scottish settlers moved to the region from Virginia for larger tracts of cheaper land. A cluster of German and Swiss settlers also moved to the region from the southeastern settlement of New Bern, North Carolina. They established such towns as Washington and Bath. The latter was home and operating base for the pirate Blackbeard, who was finally pardoned by Governor Charles Eden. Most settlers engaged in tobacco farming in the Pamlico/Tar River basin, importing numerous enslaved Africans to work on the labor-intensive crop. For years the river corridor remained somewhat of a lawless backwater. The Pamlico River was a key strategic position during the American Civil War. The river is the site of the sunken Union warship, USS Picket. The U.S. Route 17 Bridge, which connects Washington, North Carolina with nearby Chocowinity, splits the name of the river. That portion heading westward upstream is called the Tar River. Present Though the river no longer has any steamers and cargo ships floating down it, it still carries hundreds of boats per year. It is a popular fishing spot. Tobacco farming continues on agricultural land. While fishkills were a bigger problem around the year 2000, state authorities still warn against eating the river's shellfish. Though the river still faces some environmental problems, it is a beautiful tidal river that supports a variety of aquatic species. It is linked to the history of thousands of years of human settlement, from the earliest indigenous peoples, through the Tuscarora and later European and American settlers.

The series began on CBS September 17, 1944, airing on Sunday evenings at 6:30pm as Post Toasties Time (for sponsor General Foods). The title soon changed to The Baby Snooks Show, and the series was sometimes called Baby Snooks and Daddy. History In 1904, George McManus began his comic strip, The Newlyweds, about a couple and their child, Baby Snookums.Scoop: The Newlyweds (April 9, 2004) Brice began doing her Baby Snooks character in vaudeville, as she recalled in an interview shortly before her death: \\"I first did Snooks in 1912 when I was in vaudeville. At the time there was a juvenile actress named Baby Peggy and she was very popular. Her hair was all curled and bleached and she was always in pink or blue. She looked like a strawberry ice cream soda. When I started to do Baby Snooks, I really was a baby, because when I think about Baby Snooks it's really the way I was when I was a kid. On stage, I made Snooks a caricature of Baby Peggy.\\"Fanny Brice Collection: Baby Snooks. Early on, Brice's character was sometimes called \\"Babykins.\\" By 1934 she was wearing her baby costume while appearing on Broadway in the Follies show. On February 29, 1936, Brice was scheduled to appear on the Ziegfeld Follies of the Air, written and directed by Philip Rapp in 1935‚Äì37. Rapp and his writing partner David Freedman searched the closest bookcase, opened a public domain collection of sketches by Robert Jones Burdette, Chimes From a Jester‚Äôs Bells (1897), and adapted a humorous piece about a kid and his uncle, changing the boy to a girl named Snooks. Rapp continued to write the radio sketches when Brice played Snooks on the Good News Show the following year. In 1940, she became a regular character on Maxwell House Coffee Time, sharing the spotlight with actor Frank Morgan, who sometimes did a crossover into the Snooks sketches. Danny Thomas as Jerry Dingle, 1945. In 1944, the character was given her own show, and during the 1940s, it became one of the nation's favorite radio situation comedies, with a variety of sponsors (Post Cereals, Sanka, Spic-n-Span, Jell-O) being touted by a half-dozen announcers‚ÄîJohn Conte, Tobe Reed, Harlow Willcox, Dick Joy, Don Wilson and Ken Wilson. On screen, Brice portrayed Baby Snooks in the 1938 film Everybody Sing in a scene with Judy Garland as Little Lord Fauntleroy. Hanley Stafford was best known for his portrayal of Snooks' long-suffering, often-cranky father, Lancelot ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù Higgins, a role played earlier by Alan Reed on the 1936 Follies broadcasts. Lalive Brownell was Vera ‚ÄúMommy‚Äù Higgins, portrayed by Lois Corbet (mid-1940s) and Arlene Harris (after 1945). Beginning in 1945, child impersonator Leone Ledoux was first heard as Snooks' younger brother Robespierre, and Snooks returned full circle to the comics when comic book illustrator Graham Ingels and his wife Gertrude named their son Robespierre (born 1946) after listening to Ledoux's child voice. Danny Thomas was \\"daydreaming postman\\" Jerry Dingle (1944‚Äì45) who imagined himself in other occupations, such as a circus owner or railroad conductor. Others in the cast were Ben Alexander, Elvia Allman, Sara Berner, Charlie Cantor, Ken Christy, Earl Lee, Frank Nelson, Lillian Randolph, Alan Reed (as Mr. Weemish, Daddy's boss) and Irene Tedrow. The scripts by Bill Danch, Sid Dorfman, Robert Fisher, Everett Freeman, Jess Oppenheimer (later the producer and head writer of I Love Lucy), Philip Rapp (who often revised his scripts three times before airing) and Arthur Stander were produced and directed by Mann Holiner (early 1940s), Al Kaye (1944), Ted Bliss, Walter Bunker and Arthur Stander. Clark Casey and David Light handled the sound effects with music by Meredith Willson (1937‚Äì44), Carmen Dragon, and vocalist Bob Graham. BabySnooks recordingIn 1945, when illness caused Brice to miss several episodes, her absence was incorporated into the show as a plot device in which top stars (including Robert Benchley, Sydney Greenstreet, Kay Kyser and Peter Lorre) took part in a prolonged search for Snooks. In the fall of 1946, the show moved to Friday nights at 8pm, continuing on CBS until May 28, 1948. On November 9, 1949, the series moved to NBC where it was heard Tuesdays at 8:30pm. Sponsored by Tums, The Baby Snooks Show continued on NBC until May 22, 1951. Two days later, Fanny Brice had a cerebral hemorrhage, and the show ended with her death at age 59. One of the last shows in the series, \\"Report Card Blues\\" (May 1, 1951), is included in the CD set, The 60 Greatest Old-time Radio Shows of the 20th Century (1999), introduced by Walter Cronkite.University of California, Berkeley: Media Resources Center. Radio historian Arthur Frank Wertheim recalls a few of the pranks: \\"‚Ä¶planting a bees' nest at her mother's club meeting, cutting her father's fishing line into little pieces, ripping the fur off her mother's coat, inserting marbles into her father's piano and smearing glue on her baby brother.\\"Wertheim, Arthur Frank. Radio Comedy. Oxford University Press, 1979. Yet Snooks was not a mean-spirited child: \\"The character may have seemed a noisy one-joke idea based on Snooks driving Daddy to a screaming fit,\\" wrote Gerald Nachman in Raised on Radio. \\"Yet Brice was wonderfully adept at giving voice to her irritating moppet without making Snooks obnoxious.\\" Nachman quoted Variety critic Hobe Morrison: \\"Snooks was not nasty or mean, spiteful or sadistic. She was at heart a nice kid. Similarly, Daddy was harried and desperate and occasionally was driven to spanking his impish daughter. But Daddy wasn't ill-tempered or unkind with the kid. He wasn't a crab.\\" Brice herself was so meticulous and fanatical about the character that, according to Nachman, \\"she dressed in a baby-doll dress for the studio audience,\\" and she also appeared in the costume at parades and personal appearances.Goldman, Herbert G. Fanny Brice: The Original Funny Girl. Oxford University Press, 1992. She also insisted on her script being printed in extremely large type so she could avoid having to use reading glasses when on the air live. She was self-conscious about wearing glasses in front of an audience and didn't believe they fit the Snooks image. By her own admission, Brice was a lackadaisical rehearser: \\"I can't do a show until it's on the air, kid,\\" she was quoted as telling her writer/producer Everett Freeman. Yet she locked in tight when the show did go on‚Äîright down to Snooks-like \\"squirming, squinting, mugging, jumping up and down,\\" as comedian George Burns remembered. Snooks proved so universally appealing that Brice and Stafford were invited to perform in character on the second installment of The Big Show, NBC's big- budget, last-ditch bid to keep classic radio variety programming alive amidst the television onslaught. Snooks tapped on hostess Tallulah Bankhead's door to ask about a career in acting, despite Daddy's telling her she already didn't have what it took. Later in the show, Snooks and Daddy appeared with fellow guest star Groucho Marx in a spoof of Marx's popular quiz-and-comedy show, You Bet Your Life.\\"The Marx Brothers Radio Shows and Guest Appearances\\": The Big Show (November 12, 1950) Television Brice and Stafford brought Baby Snooks and Daddy to television only once, an appearance on the June 12, 1950, edition of CBS-TV's Popsicle Parade of Stars. This was Fanny Brice's only appearance on television, with Baby Snooks portrayed by the adult Brice in a little girl's outfit. Brice later admitted that the character of Baby Snooks just didn't work properly when seen. Death Fanny Brice died May 29, 1951, with her memoirs unfinished and with Baby Snooks due on the air that same night. The May 29 memorial broadcast, a musical tribute to Brice, ended with a short eulogy from Stafford: \\"We have lost a very real, a very warm, a very wonderful woman.\\"Grossman, Barbara Wallace.

Biography Hill was born in Annapolis, Maryland, and attended the common schools. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1900 and from the law department of Harvard University in 1903. He was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced practice in Boston, Massachusetts. He returned to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1904 and continued the practice of law. Hill was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Sixty- first Congress in 1908. He served as United States Attorney for the district of Maryland from 1910 to 1915. In 1915, Hill was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Baltimore, and served as delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1916. He served as judge advocate for the Fifteenth Division, and attached to the Fourteenth Cavalry, Mexican border service, from August 26 to December 15, 1916. During the First World War, he was major and lieutenant colonel in the United States Army in 1918 and 1919. After the war, Hill was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-seventh, Sixty-eighth, and Sixty-ninth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1921 to March 3, 1927. To date, he is the last Republican to represent a significant portion of Baltimore in the House. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate in 1926, an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1928 to the Seventy-first Congress, and again in 1936 to the Seventy-fifth Congress. Hill moved to New York City in 1937 and continued the practice of law until he returned to Annapolis in 1940. Hill died in Washington, D.C., and is interred in Arlington National Cemetery. During Prohibition, Hill planted some grape vines and apples trees in his yard, and renamed his house \\"Franklin Farms\\", since farmers were allowed to make wine and cider. He was arrested and charged with the illegal manufacture of liquor, but the jury pronounced it \\"not intoxicating in fact\\", even though its alcohol content was more than 12%.

These braids form the logic gates that make up the computer. The advantage of a quantum computer based on quantum braids over using trapped quantum particles is that the former is much more stable. Small, cumulative perturbations can cause quantum states to decohere and introduce errors in the computation, but such small perturbations do not change the braids' topological properties. This is like the effort required to cut a string and reattach the ends to form a different braid, as opposed to a ball (representing an ordinary quantum particle in four-dimensional spacetime) bumping into a wall. Alexei Kitaev proposed topological quantum computation in 1997. While the elements of a topological quantum computer originate in a purely mathematical realm, experiments in fractional quantum Hall systems indicate these elements may be created in the real world using semiconductors made of gallium arsenide at a temperature of near absolute zero and subjected to strong magnetic fields. Introduction Anyons are quasiparticles in a two-dimensional space. Anyons are neither fermions nor bosons, but like fermions, they cannot occupy the same state. Thus, the world lines of two anyons cannot intersect or merge, which allows their paths to form stable braids in space-time. Anyons can form from excitations in a cold, two- dimensional electron gas in a very strong magnetic field, and carry fractional units of magnetic flux. This phenomenon is called the fractional quantum Hall effect. In typical laboratory systems, the electron gas occupies a thin semiconducting layer sandwiched between layers of aluminium gallium arsenide. When anyons are braided, the transformation of the quantum state of the system depends only on the topological class of the anyons' trajectories (which are classified according to the braid group). Therefore, the quantum information which is stored in the state of the system is impervious to small errors in the trajectories. In 2005, Sankar Das Sarma, Michael Freedman, and Chetan Nayak proposed a quantum Hall device that would realize a topological qubit. In a key development for topological quantum computers, in 2005 Vladimir J. Goldman, Fernando E. Camino, and Wei Zhou claimed to have created and observed the first experimental evidence for using a fractional quantum Hall effect to create actual anyons, although others have suggested their results could be the product of phenomena not involving anyons. Non-abelian anyons, a species required for topological quantum computers, have yet to be experimentally confirmed. Possible experimental evidence has been found, but the conclusions remain contested. Topological vs. standard quantum computer Topological quantum computers are equivalent in computational power to other standard models of quantum computation, in particular to the quantum circuit model and to the quantum Turing machine model. That is, any of these models can efficiently simulate any of the others. Nonetheless, certain algorithms may be a more natural fit to the topological quantum computer model. For example, algorithms for evaluating the Jones polynomial were first developed in the topological model, and only later converted and extended in the standard quantum circuit model. Computations To live up to its name, a topological quantum computer must provide the unique computation properties promised by a conventional quantum computer design, which uses trapped quantum particles. Fortunately in 2000, Michael H. Freedman, Alexei Kitaev, Michael J. Larsen, and Zhenghan Wang proved that a topological quantum computer can, in principle, perform any computation that a conventional quantum computer can do, and vice versa. They found that a conventional quantum computer device, given an error-free operation of its logic circuits, will give a solution with an absolute level of accuracy, whereas a topological quantum computing device with flawless operation will give the solution with only a finite level of accuracy. However, any level of precision for the answer can be obtained by adding more braid twists (logic circuits) to the topological quantum computer, in a simple linear relationship. In other words, a reasonable increase in elements (braid twists) can achieve a high degree of accuracy in the answer. Actual computation [gates] are done by the edge states of a fractional quantum Hall effect. This makes models of one-dimensional anyons important. In one space dimension, anyons are defined algebraically.  Error correction and control  Even though quantum braids are inherently more stable than trapped quantum particles, there is still a need to control for error inducing thermal fluctuations, which produce random stray pairs of anyons which interfere with adjoining braids. Controlling these errors is simply a matter of separating the anyons to a distance where the rate of interfering strays drops to near zero. Simulating the dynamics of a topological quantum computer may be a promising method of implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation even with a standard quantum information processing scheme. Raussendorf, Harrington, and Goyal have studied one model, with promising simulation results.  Example: Computing with Fibonacci Anyons  One of the prominent examples in topological quantum computing is with a system of fibonacci anyons. In the context of conformal field theory, fibonacci anyons are described by the Yang‚ÄìLee model, the SU(2) special case of the Chern‚ÄìSimons theory and Wess‚ÄìZumino‚ÄìWitten models. These anyons can be used to create generic gates for topological quantum computing. There are three main steps for creating a model: * Choose our basis and restrict our Hilbert space * Braid the anyons together * Fuse the anyons at the end, and detect how they fuse in order to read the output of the system.  State Preparation  Fibonacci anyons are defined by three qualities: # They have a topological charge of \\\\tau. In this discussion, we consider another charge called 1 which is the ‚Äòvacuum‚Äô charge if anyons are annihilated with each-other. # Each of these anyons are their own antiparticle. \\\\tau = \\\\tau^* and 1 = 1^*. # If brought close to each-other, they will ‚Äòfuse‚Äô together in a nontrivial fashion. Specifically, the ‚Äòfusion‚Äô rules are: ## 1 \\\\otimes 1 = 1 ## 1 \\\\otimes \\\\tau = \\\\tau \\\\otimes 1 = \\\\tau ## \\\\tau \\\\otimes \\\\tau = 1 \\\\oplus \\\\tau # Many of the properties of this system can be explained similarly to that of two spin 1/2 particles. Particularly, we use the same tensor product \\\\otimes and direct sum \\\\oplus operators. The last ‚Äòfusion‚Äô rule can be extended this to a system of three anyons: :\\\\tau \\\\otimes \\\\tau \\\\otimes \\\\tau = \\\\tau \\\\otimes (1 \\\\oplus \\\\tau) = \\\\tau \\\\otimes 1 \\\\oplus \\\\tau \\\\otimes \\\\tau = \\\\tau \\\\oplus 1 \\\\oplus \\\\tau = 1 \\\\oplus 2 \\\\cdot \\\\tau Thus, fusing three anyons will yield a final state of total charge \\\\tau in 2 ways, or a charge of 1 in exactly one way. We use three states to define our basis. However, because we wish to encode these three anyon states as superpositions of 0 and 1, we need to limit the basis to a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Thus, we consider only two states with a total charge of \\\\tau. This choice is purely phenomenological. In these states, we group the two leftmost anyons into a 'control group', and leave the rightmost as a 'non-computational anyon'. We classify a |0\\\\rangle state as one where the control group has total 'fused' charge of 1, and a state of |1 \\\\rangle has a control group with a total 'fused' charge of \\\\tau. For a more complete description, see Nayak.  Gates  Following the ideas above, adiabatically braiding these anyons around each-other with result in a unitary transformation. These braid operators are a result of two subclasses of operators: * The F matrix * The R matrix The R matrix can be conceptually thought of as the topological phase that is imparted onto the anyons during the braid. As the anyons wind around each-other, they pick up some phase due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The F matrix is a result of the physical rotations of the anyons. As they braid between each-other, it is important to realize that the bottom two anyons‚Äîthe control group‚Äîwill still distinguish the state of the qubit. Thus, braiding the anyons will change which anyons are in the control group, and therefore change the basis. We evaluate the anyons by always fusing the control group (the bottom anyons) together first, so exchanging which anyons these are will rotate the system. Because these anyons are non-abelian, the order of the anyons (which ones are within the control group) will matter, and as such they will transform the system. The complete braid operator can be derived as: B=F^{-1} R F In order to mathematically construct the F and R operators, we can consider permutations of these F and R operators. We know that if we sequentially change the basis that we are operating on, this will eventually lead us back to the same basis. Similarly, we know that if we braid anyons around each-other a certain number of times, this will lead back to the same state. These axioms are called the pentagonal and hexagonal axioms respectively as performing the operation can be visualized with a pentagon/hexagon of state transformations.

The area was originally a slum, until its redevelopment after the 1990s. Geography Tai Hang is a valley with an opening to Causeway Bay in north and So Kon Po in west. To its south and east are hills. The former coastline is marked by Tung Lo Wan Road and the main road Tai Hang Road winds in the hills throughout the area. The area of Tai Hang is divided into upper and lower areas. The upper area includes a public housing estate Lai Tak Tsuen and some highrise residential blocks for affluents, such as Illumination Terrace (, 5-7 Tai Hang Road) or Grand Deco Tower (, 26 Tai Hang Road). The lower area has many old residential blocks, with a number of restaurants along the streets. It is named after a stream (or drainage) from nearby hills. Features Lin Fa Temple in Tai Hang One interesting recent development in the plain north is that many new and special restaurants were opened, making Tai Hang a hot spot for dining and leisure. Lai Tak Tsuen is located in the area. The famous Tiger Balm Garden was also located in the area. The Lin Fa Temple is located at the end of Lin Fa Kung Street.http://www.gohk.gov.hk/text/eng/welcome/wc_spots.html It was originally built 1863, during the Qing Dynasty, and was reconstructed in 1986 and 1999. The original use of the temple was a worship place for Kwan Yin, the goddess of mercy.http://www.thaiworldview.com/hongkong/hkisland/causewaybay3.htm. Tai Hang fire dragon dance Tai Hang Fire Dragon Dance For the three nights straddling the Mid-Autumn festival,As cited from Discover Hong Kong Tourism Board the Tai Hang fire dragon dance is held in Tai Hang. The main attraction is a 67-metre-long 'fire dragon' that winds its way with much fanfare and smoke through a collection of streets located in Tai Hang, close to Victoria Park in Causeway Bay. Fire dragon dance started in 1880 when Tai Hang was a small Hakka village of farmers and fishermen on the waterfront of Causeway Bay. This custom has been followed every year since 1880, with the exception of the Japanese Occupation and the 1967 disturbances.Geoffrey Roper \\"Report on Visit to Tai Hang Fire Dragon Dance, Mid Autumn Festival 1992\\", in Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch, Vol. 30, 1990. pp.307-308 According to local legend, over a century ago, a few days before the Mid- Autumn Festival, a typhoon and then a plague wreaked havoc on the village. While the villagers were repairing the damage, a python entered the village and ate their livestock. According to some villagers, the python was the son of the Dragon King. A soothsayer decreed the only way to stop the chaos was to stage a fire dance for three days and nights during the upcoming mid-autumn festival. The villagers made a huge dragon of straw and covered it with incense sticks, which they then lit. Accompanied by drummers and erupting firecrackers, they danced for three days and three nights ‚Äì and the plague disappeared.

Life He was born a Nisei Japanese-American, but at age 8 moved back to his parents' home country, where he extensively studied the art of bonsai due to his grandfather's influence. He returned to the United States near Boulder, Colorado in 1935, and then in late 1946 settled in Los Angeles, California with his wife Alice and their three sons, Eugene, Robert, and Richard. In Orange County, Naka and four friends founded a bonsai club in November, 1950, which is known today as the California Bonsai Society. He became a very important force in American bonsai art in the 1950s‚Äì60s. He was a driving force in the spread of bonsai appreciation and the practice of bonsai art in the West and elsewhere. Naka traveled and taught extensively around the world, at conventions and clubs, but refused to hold classes in Japan (where bonsai had been highly developed along certain lines over the centuries), saying \\"They want me to teach, and I tell them it's like trying to preach to Buddha.\\" Naka's masterpiece Goshin is on display at the United States National Arboretum. A very few of his many accomplishments are the following: He published two books, entitled Bonsai Techniques I and Bonsai Techniques II, texts that are revered as being the bibles of western bonsai to many artists. These books would be translated into French, German, Italian, and Spanish by 1990. He contributed articles, forewords, and photographs to a number of specialty magazines and books. Nina S. Ragle's compilation of 287 proverbs presented in both Japanese and English from Naka, Even Monkeys Fall Out of Trees, was published in 1987. (The title refers to the little recognized fact that, yes, even bonsai masters can make a mistake.) He was a founding director of the World Bonsai Friendship Federation (WBFF) and a co- signer of the Constitution of the Latin-American Bonsai Federation (LABF). He was an honorary advisor to the National Bonsai Foundation. Other quotes of his included \\"Bonsai is not the result: that comes after. Your enjoyment is what is important\\"; \\"It must have philosophy, botany, artistry, human quality behind it to be a bonsai\\"; \\"The bonsai is not you working on the tree; you have to have the tree work on you\\"; and \\"Leave room for the birds to fly through\\" the branches of your bonsai. Of Naka's many works, the most recognizable composition is Goshin, which means \\"protector of the spirit.\\" It is a group planting of eleven foemina junipers, each tree placed to represent one of Naka's grandchildren. The planting can be seen on display at the National Arboretum. About a month before he died, Naka donated his very first bonsai, a Montezuma Cypress, to the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum. In May 2005, a collection of over 80 of his drawings of how he envisioned the future development of various workshop participants' trees was published as John Naka's Sketchbook, edited by Jack Billet and Cheryl Manning. Awards and honors On May 23, 1960 Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shunichiro Fujiyama presented Mr. Naka with an honorary citation from the Japanese government for his effort in promotion of goodwill and friendship between Japan and the United States.Bonsai Techniques I, On November 24, 1967 Mr. Naka received an honorary medal and citation from the President of Japanese Agricultural Affairs Department, Prince Norihito Takamatsu and Eikichi Hiratsuka. On May 20, 1972 the County of Los Angeles' Supervisor Mr. Ernest E. Debs presented Mr. Naka an honorary citation on behalf of the County for \\"his outstanding contributions to the Japanese-American friendship by providing the people of Los Angeles and the nation with ability to understand and appreciate the beauty and significance of bonsai culture.\\" In 1985, Emperor Hirohito of Japan bestowed upon Naka the most prestigious award for a non-Japanese citizen, The Fifth Class of the Order of the Rising Sun. Naka was chosen in 1992 as one of thirteen honorees to receive a National Heritage Fellowship, the first bonsai artist to receive this prestigious award. At the time he received his Fellowship, he said, \\"It has a beginning but no end. A bud today becomes a branch tomorrow.\\" In 2001, a portrait bust, by Bonnie Kobert- Harrison, was unveiled at the National Bonsai & Penjing Museum, National Arboretum, Washington, D.C. He was awarded a 2009 Pacific Pioneer Award posthumously.http://magiminiland.org/JYN3.html#Drawings The American Bonsai Society named the John Naka Award for him. An endowment fund was established in his name. In May 2014, Naka became the first inductee into the National Bonsai & Penjing Museum's Bonsai Hall of Fame.

John Charles Linthicum (November 26, 1867-October 5, 1932) was a U.S. Congressman from the 4th Congressional district of Maryland, serving from 1911 to 1932. Biography Linthicum was born on 26 November 1867 near Baltimore, Maryland, in the locality now known as Linthicum Heights, Anne Arundel County, the son of Sweetser Linthicum Sr. (1824‚Äì1905) and Laura Ellen Smith (1829‚Äì1910). He and his many siblings attended the public schools of Anne Arundel County and Baltimore. He graduated from the Maryland State Normal School in Baltimore in 1886, and became principal of the Braddock School in Frederick County, Maryland, in 1887. He also taught in the schools of Anne Arundel County, and studied history and political science at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He graduated from the law school at the University of Maryland School of Law in Baltimore in 1890, and was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Baltimore in 1890. In 1893 he married Eugenia May Biden but she died in 1897. In 1898, he married at Emmanuel Protestant Episcopal Church of Baltimore as his second wife Helen Aletta Perry (1868‚Äì1944), widow of wealthy jeweler Gilbert D. Clark (d. 8 Dec 1896) and daughter of a prominent medical doctor. By 1900, his younger brother Seth Hance Linthicum was the junior partner in their growing law firm, while both were partners with their younger brother Wade Hampton Linthicum in the Linthicum Realty Company, and with their brother Dr. George Milton Linthicum in the Linthicum Heights Company. Linthicum served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates in 1904 and 1905, and in the Maryland State Senate from 1906 to 1909. He was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Baltimore in 1907, and was a judge advocate general on the staff of Maryland Governor Austin Lane Crothers from 1908 to 1912. He was elected as a Democrat to the Sixty-second and to the ten succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1911, until his death. Linthicum's most important role in Congress was that of the leader of the Wets (those who advocated the repeal of alcohol prohibition), succeeding John Philip Hill in 1927. Working with Republican James M. Beck of Pennsylvania, Linthicum co-wrote and in 1932 introduced the Beck-Linthicum Bill which was designed to repeal the 18th Amendment.United States House Journal, January 15, 1932, page 247 Although the bill failed, it is highly significant in that it forced the wet and dry members to go on record as such, which aided the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform and other repeal organizations. This resulted in the drys being voted out office and the eventual repeal of prohibition. In June 1917, John Charles Linthicum Jr., born John Charles Dillon, orphaned nephew of his wife who became their foster son, died while a student boarding at Tome School. In 1918, Linthicum was motivated by his wife Helen a noted \\"club woman\\" and by Mrs. Reuben Ross Holloway, to become the first to introduce a bill which would make the Star Spangled Banner the official national anthem of the United States, though it was not made so until 1931. During the Seventy-second Congress, he served as chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and had been renominated to the Seventy-third Congress at the time of his death. While serving as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Linthicum co-sponsored the Moses-Linthicum Act,The Moses-Linthicum Act. In the Beginning: The Rogers Act of 1924. American Foreign Service Association; accessed April 2018. achieved the \\"scheduling\\" of the foreign service and instituted the policy of U.S. government ownership of its embassies. Linthicum had also served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1924. Legacy His home, Twin Oaks, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

It uses twin hydrofoils designed to raise the hull out of the water to increase the speed. Speeds of up to 27.2 km/h (7.6 m¬∑s‚àí1, 16.9 mph) can be achieved on calm water. Design The Flyak has two hydrofoil fins below the surface of the water to create lift. At high speeds the entire hull is lifted 15 cm (5.9 in) from the water, reducing the drag and allows greater speeds ‚Äì reportedly more than twice the speed of a conventional kayak. History The Flyak was designed by Einar Rasmussen and Peter Ribe in Norway and released in 2005. The hydrofoil lift method is well established for motor- and man-powered water craft, but the Flyak is the first to incorporate the design into a commercially marketed kayak. Initial price estimate is US$2500.

At the beginning of the story, the Federated Commonwealth, an alliance of House Steiner and House Davion, is breaking apart due to Archon Katrina Steiner's controversial seizure of power. All the Houses on Carver V are avoiding any military action that could endanger the peace, so when a suspiciously well- equipped bandit force threatens Steiner territory, House Steiner employs a mercenary team led by the player, who takes the role of their commander. In Campaign 1, the player is under the command of Colonel David Renard of House Steiner, and starts with relatively simple missions to destroy minor bandit forces. However, a chase of a bandit convoy results in a firefight with Liao units. It is then revealed that the bandit leader is an ex-Liao officer. Renard authorizes full-scale attacks on Liao forces despite protests from Steiner Ambassador Yee. The final mission of the campaign ends with the destruction of the bandit HQ and the death of their leader. Over the course of the campaign, Colonel Renard becomes increasingly unstable, ending the campaign with the words \\"Do this and get out. I've got plans for Carver V and you don't want to be part of them.\\" In Campaign 2, the player's mercenary team enters into a new contract with House Liao. The player is under the command of Mandrissa Anita Cho (widow of Mandarin Cho), who wants the planet for her son, Captain Jason Cho. The player is tasked with various covert operations, including the destruction of the interstellar communications relay on Carver V's moon and strikes against House Davion and House Steiner designed to implicate each other. Between Mandrissa Cho's machinations, Renard's instability, and the lack of off-world communications, Steiner and Davion forces on Carver V go to war. House Liao then makes a grab for power, but due to Jason Cho's incompetence as a commander, Liao forces are badly beaten and are forced to negotiate a truce with House Steiner. Colonel Renard agrees to share Carver V with House Liao in return for their help eliminating the Davions and the player's mercenaries. The player is forced to flee before the advancing Steiner and Liao forces, and are saved by resistance forces led by Baxter, a local partisan leader who wants his planet to become independent. In Campaign 3, it is revealed that Baxter and Davion commander Major Kelly (Patricia Kara) have allied, as Davion supports an independent Carver V. In exchange for the opportunity for revenge and Clan technology, the player fights for the rebels, destroying the Liao palace, killing the crazed Colonel Renard, and destroying Steiner High Command on Carver V. The Campaign ends with Archon Katrina Steiner mourning Colonel Renard's death, Baxter becoming President of Carver V, which is renamed Liberty, and the mercenary team returning to the Periphery - raising their price on MercNet. \\"Peace has been restored on Carver V by an unlikely source - a mercenary commander.\\" BattleMechs A BattleMech attempts to sneak up behind a hostile Highlander 'Mech. MechCommander 2 features 29 mechs each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Generally, the lighter Mechs scout while the heavier mechs fight. Depending on which side the mercenary Mechcommander works for, different mechs would be available for purchase and salvage after combat missions. The mechs from each House also display different characteristics; heavy firepower for House Steiner mechs, agility and advanced sensors for House Liao mechs, and superior-quality 'imported' Clan mechs for House Davion. Reception John Lee reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"An eminently playable, thoroughly engrossing game that's very close to its roots.\\" MechCommander 2 garnered generally positive reviews, and holds an average of 79% on aggregate web site GameRankings.

His work, much of it meta-fictional and/or satirical in approach, has provoked a notable measure of controversy and debate within English- language poetry circles.  Career  Since the late 1990s, Johnson has widely been thought to be the author of the Araki Yasusada writings, which a reviewer for the Nation magazine, in 1998, called ‚Äúthe most controversial work of poetry since Allen Ginsberg‚Äôs Howl.‚Äù Johnson, however, has never officially claimed authorship of the material, presenting himself only as ‚Äúexecutor‚Äù of an archive supposedly composed by a writer, or writers, whose choice has been to maintain a principled anonymity in relation to the work. In recent years, the Yasusada discussion has moved from the realm of literary scandal and gossip into considerations of more scholarly kind, and a substantial number of academic articles have by now engaged the topic, pro and con. In 2011, a book of critical studies, Scubadivers and Chrysanthemums: Essays on the Poetry of Araki Yasusada, was published in England, to which Johnson was one of eighteen contributors. Lyric Poetry after Auschwitz: Eleven Submissions to the War (its contents later included into a larger collection, Homage to the Last Avant- Garde, 2009) was published in 2005. As the first book of poetry in the United States to respond to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was the subject of numerous reviews and blog commentaries, a good deal of the latter hostile. The title poem of the collection, ‚ÄúLyric Poetry after Auschwitz, or: Get the Hood Back On,‚Äù angrily confronts the torture committed at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere, though it does so in a manner quite non-conventional for ‚Äúanti-war‚Äù poetry: The poem proceeds in a series of stanzas set in the voices of American military prison guards, who calmly chat with Iraqi prisoners and sociably describe their quite normal backgrounds at home, before graphically informing the prisoners of the tortures to which they will be subjected. The poem, however, concludes unexpectedly when the voice of a generic U. S. poet joins the chorus of torturers, and in good-natured tone tells his captive to stop pleading and just accept the horror of his fate, because there is, after all, nothing that poetry can do to help him. More recently, Johnson became the focus of controversy, including threatened legal action, when he published a book that proposed, by means of an elaborate, forensically detailed hypothesis (supplemented in the book by a quasi-detective novella), that the poet Kenneth Koch may have been the hidden author of ‚ÄúA True Account of Talking to the Sun at Fire Island,‚Äù one of Frank O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs canonical poems, composing it shortly after O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs death, and then placing it under his late friend‚Äôs name in a sui generis act of comradeship and mourning. First published in a limited edition in 2011, an expanded, second edition of this book, titled A Question Mark above the Sun: Documents on the Mystery Surrounding a Famous Poem \\"by\\" Frank O‚ÄôHara, was published in 2012 and named a ‚ÄúBook of the Year‚Äù by the Times Literary Supplement. Johnson lived most of his childhood and adolescence in Montevideo, Uruguay, returning to work there in the mid-1970s. In the early 1980s, on two extended visits, he worked with the Sandinista Revolution as a literacy and Adult Education teaching volunteer in rural zones of Nicaragua. Since 1991, he has taught English and Spanish at Highland Community College in Freeport, Illinois. In 2004, he was named State Teacher of the Year by the Illinois Community College Board of Trustees. He has received a Pushcart Book of the Month Award, an Ohio Board of Regents Grant for research in the U.S.S.R., an Illinois Arts Council Poetry Prize, a National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship, a PEN Translation Grant, a Finalist nomination for the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation, a travel grant from the University of Chile, and a Visiting Writer Grant from the U.S. Embassy in Uruguay.

Born in Conversano, Puglia, he was the second son of Duke Giulio Antonio Acquaviva and his wife Caterina Orsini del Balzo. She was a first cousin of Queen Isabella, the wife of King Ferrante of Naples.\\"Acquaviva d'Aragona, Andrea Matteo\\", Treccani He and his brothers were educated in Naples by the humanist scholar Giovanni Pontano. In 1464 he became Marquis of Bitonto. In September 1477, Andrea Matteo married Isabella Piccolomini of Aragon, the daughter of King Ferrante's natural daughter, Maria of Aragon. Maria's husband, Antonio Todeschini Piccolomini, Duke of Amalfi, was a nephew of Pope Pius II and brother of Pope Pius III. In 1478, he purchased from the royal state property the fief of Sternatia in Terra di Otranto. He was prepared by his father for the life of arms, fighting with him in Tuscany (1478) and then in Otranto against the Turks in 1481. His elder brother Giovanni Antonio died in Pisa in 1479. Upon the death of his father in Otranto, Andrea Matteo, as the elder surviving son, inherited the title of Duke of Atri and Count of S. Flaviano, which made him feudal lord of much of Abruzzo. He also received the maternal fiefdoms with the title of Count of Conversano. In 1482, during the War of Ferrara, he fought for Ferdinand I of Naples on behalf of the king's son-in- law, Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara against Pope Sixtus IV and his Venetian allies. In 1485, he joined the Conspiracy of the Barons, perhaps because the Aragonese did not want to return Teramo to Acquaviva. Eventually defeated, he was one of the few barons spared, due to the intervention of his father-in- law, Antonio Piccolomini, who happened to be the King's son-in-law.Damiani, Roberto. \\"Andrea Matteo Acquaviva\\", condottieridiventura.it Andrea Matteo distinguished himself as a partisan of the French. He was made prisoner by Consalvo of Cordova and carried into Spain; but his confinement was not long; and on his return to Naples he became a patron of letters. He was kept away from political life, due to suspicious of his past as an advocate of the French cause. In 1510, Andrea Matteo and other barons assemble in Naples Cathedral to protest the introduction of the Spanish Inquisition into the territory. The following year, he returns the collar of the French Order of Saint Michael. He died in Puglia in 1529. To literary men he was indeed a benefactor‚Äîhence the encomia which have been lavished upon him, and which, more than any merit of his own, obtained him distinction. Yet he wrote one book at least, a commentary on the Latin translation of Plutarch's Moralia.

The hakama is unconventional in its appearance due to the fact that the sleeves are detached, exposing her armpits, which has become the subject of an Internet meme. In 2006, d≈çjin music group IOSYS, who make Touhou-themed music parodies, released the song Tsukiyo wo Kakusanai Teido no Nouryoku?, which made frequent usage of the line \\"Waki miko Reimu\\" (armpit miko Reimu), leading to an unofficial nickname. Her main abilities are flying in the sky, good intuition, and getting along with everyone; even those who were once her enemies. In the games, she is characterized by her homing amulets and yin-yang orbs. In addition to being in all of the Touhou games (apart from Touhou Shoot the Bullet and Fairy Wars). She also appears in Graffiti Kingdom as \\"Flying Maiden\\", a game which ZUN helped to develop. Marisa Kirisame Marisa in Undefined Fantastic Object *Species: Human *Ability: Magic *Residence: Forest of Magic is a human magician who lives in a cluttered house in the Forest of Magic. She is friends with Reimu and visits her often, but is otherwise solitary and spends most of her time researching magic. She is an avid collector, hoarding almost any item she comes across, often \\"borrowing\\" things without permission from various other characters. She talks in a direct, and often rude way, highlighting her tomboyish nature and otherwise devil-may-care attitude. While she is prone to violence, selfishness, and other disagreeable behaviors, she is an honest and hard worker, usually on the front lines of defending Gensokyo whenever an incident occurs. She is contrasted with Reimu, the naturally-talented protagonist, as Marisa's powers derive entirely from hard work and determination rather than any abilities she was born with, and it's said that she wins her fights with Reimu \\"about 40% of the time.\\" In the games, her attacks are characterized by five-pointed star motifs and lasers, and other high-level destructive magic. Consistent to her \\"borrowing\\" habit, many of her spells are inspired by other characters, such as her signature move \\"Master Spark\\" which was originally Yuuka Kazami's, or her \\"Nondirectional Laser\\" attack, which was originally Patchouli's attack. Furthermore, she is the best character for collecting power-ups, as she moves faster than any other character, and when playing as Marisa, items will have a larger hitbox, making it easier to acquire them. She is fairly short. Additional game characters Highly Responsive to Prayers ; :The Stage 5 boss. The gatekeeper of the Hakurei Shrine.

Most of her mannerisms were later adopted by Marisa. ; *Species: Human *Ability: Artificial Magic *Residence: Dream Ruins :Professor of comparative physics at an unnamed university in a world beyond Gensokyo.

This laser is later adopted by Marisa as her signature Master Spark. :For her later appearance in Phantasmagoria of Flower View, see Yuuka Kazami. ; *Species: Demon :A human-looking, blonde-haired girl in a maid uniform.

An ice fairy that lives on the lake surrounding the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Although she is weak from the players' perspective, appearing only as the 2nd stage boss, and a Stage 1 midboss in Perfect Cherry Blossom, she is one of the strongest fairies in Gensokyo. Regardless, her weakness compared to most others in Gensokyo, and her bravado leads her to be the subject of mockery. Her hobby is freezing frogs and watching them revive as they thaw, but she tends to shatter them instead by accident. Unlike Letty Whiterock, she radiates cold air year-round, and can stay awake even in spring and summer. She is short. :She is often called \\"‚ë®\\" (pronounced \\"nineball\\") by fans, and the character \\"‚ë®\\" is regarded as a symbol of \\"Baka\\" (Stupid), since ZUN labeled her as such in the manual of Phantasmagoria of Flower View. She is also one of the mascots of the 9front operating system. ; *Species: Y≈çkai *Ability: Manipulation of qi *Residence: Scarlet Devil Mansion :Stage 3 boss. A Chinese girl serving as the door guard of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Canonically, she is known to be a very humanoid y≈çkai who practices martial arts, but is generally friendly towards humans. Her name has been the subject of confusion in the fanbase, as Japanese fans were not sure whether to read her name in Japanese, (Kurenai Misuzu) or in Chinese (Hong Meiling). Some people chose to simply call her Ch≈´goku (China), a name that she's still sometimes called, though ZUN has confirmed during a Q&A; at Meiji University that the Chinese reading of Hong Meiling is correct. This is referenced in Immaterial and Missing Power, wherein one of her win quotes is \\"please remember my name.\\" In d≈çjinshi, she is usually portrayed as a joke character, constantly being abused by the other residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion in a humorous fashion, especially Sakuya. She is one of the more popular Touhou characters, and was added as a playable character in a patch for Immaterial and Missing Power, despite not having a story of her own. In Touhou His≈çtensoku, she is reintroduced as a playable character with her own storyline. She has aqua-colored eyes and long, scarlet hair that symbolizes the place that she's guarding. Her outfit is traditionally Chinese, composed of a Cheongsam, and a beret with a star that reads dragon (Èæç) in Chinese. She is tall. ; *Species: Devil *Residence: Scarlet Devil Mansion :Stage 4 mid- boss. Similar to Daiyousei, she received no character profile in the game and was named Koakuma (lit. \\"Little Devil\\") by fans. However, she is popular for a relatively obscure character. ZUN later described her to be like Daiyousei ‚Äî whimsical, enjoys pranks, and acts without thinking. He also added that while devils are as powerful as vampires and magicians, Koakuma is a rather weak one, therefore, she is a Koakuma (Little Devil). She lives in the Scarlet Devil Mansion, and is thought to be an assistant to Patchouli Knowledge of some sort, but no specific details have been given. ; *Species: Witch *Ability: Able to manipulate elemental magic, like fire, water, wood, metal, earth, sun, and the moon *Residence: Scarlet Devil Mansion :Stage 4 boss, and a playable character in Immaterial and Missing Power, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, and Hisoutensoku. A scholar who is a friend of Remilia Scarlet. She resides in the library of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, and is the de facto librarian. In fact, she rarely leaves it and is somewhat of a hikikomori, choosing not to leave because the sun damages her hair or the books. She has command over the seven elements (which the Japanese days of the week are named after, making her the \\"One-week Wizard\\") and is in theory an extremely powerful magician. Patchouli is the name of a plant, from which oils and perfumes can be made, and the surname Knowledge is a rather literal reference to her studious nature. However, her constitution is very poor and asthma often prevents her from reciting her spells. This is also reflected in the fighting games, where she moves slowly, and likes to keep distance between herself and her opponent. She has a tenuous relationship with Marisa, who tends to 'borrow' her books without asking. She is fairly short. ; *Species: Human *Ability: Manipulation of time *Residence: Scarlet Devil Mansion :Stage 5 boss, and a playable character in Touhou games Perfect Cherry Blossom, Imperishable Night, Phantasmagoria of Flower View, Double Dealing Character, Immaterial and Missing Power, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, and Hisoutensoku.

Furthermore, it also seems she is able to change the speed at which time flows. However, as it is difficult to reverse events that have already occurred, and since she is not able to return broken things to how they were originally even if she reversed time, in actuality, it is not possible for her to reverse time.„ÄéÈ¶ôÈúñÂ†Ç„ÄèÂçòË°åÊú¨Á¨¨4-5Ë©± However, she is able to do things to the extent of moving things back to where they were originally.

In Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, Akyuu guessed that she might have originally been a vampire hunter. A recurring joke with Sakuya in d≈çjinshi usually involves her stabbing Hong Meiling mercilessly with her knives, usually due to Meiling's laziness or inability to keep unwanted visitors, such as Reimu and Marisa, out of the mansion. However, Sakuya does care for Meiling's well-being, and the two have a close relationship, as demonstrated in Eastern and Little Nature Deity / Strange and Bright Nature Deity. :At the time of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she merely worked at the Scarlet Devil Mansion in return for food. Continuing in Imperishable Night, she did not worry at all about the clothing, food or housing and felt satisfied.„ÄéÊ∞∏Â§úÊäÑ„Äè‰ªòÂ±û„ÅÆ„Äå„Ç≠„É£„É©Ë®≠ÂÆö.txt„Äç„ÄÇ Meanwhile, she is utterly devoted to her mistress, Remilia. ; *Species: Vampire *Age: Approximately 500 years *Ability: Manipulation of fate *Residence: Scarlet Devil Mansion :Final boss, and a playable character in Immaterial and Missing Power, Imperishable Night, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, and Hisoutensoku. Remilia is the vampiric mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion who claims to be descended from Vlad III Dracula, and her prelude theme song is titled The Young Descendant of Tepes, referencing his Romanian name, Vlad Tepes, but she has no actual connection to him. She is known as the Scarlet Devil as when she feeds, the blood of her victims stains her dress scarlet. Apart from her unpleasant needs, she is hardly malicious enough to deserve such a title; as though she is over five hundred years old, and has appropriate wisdom, her attitude is comparable to that of a young child. Although being a vampire is normally a lonely life, she has a good relationship with her many employees (including Sakuya and Meiling). Reimu is one of the few humans who tolerates her, and Remilia seems quite fond of her in turn. Marisa also gets along with her in exchange for access to her library. Her power is the control of fate (which has never been overtly demonstrated in the games). She prefers melee fighting to danmaku, but when she does resort to the latter, she is fond of red bullets and knives. She is short. ; *Species: Vampire *Age: Over 495 years *Ability: Enough power to destroy anything *Residence: Scarlet Devil Mansion :Extra Stage boss. Remilia's little sister, she is not allowed to leave the mansion's basement, and knows very little about life on the outside. This doesn't upset Flandre - she likes her sister and usually doesn't try escaping. However, because of this fact, Flandre is generally ignorant. Most vampires hold back somewhat when fighting humans, as they plan to keep them alive and feed from them later, but Flandre was always fed prepared dishes and does not know her food comes from humans. Thus, when fighting them, she does not hesitate and incinerates them without a second thought. In d≈çjinshi, she is very fond of Reimu and Marisa and is often portrayed as somewhat crazy, though alternate portrayals as a sweet \\"Little Sister\\"-type are also popular. She is short. :Her theme music, \\"U.N. Owen Was Her?\\" was based on the book And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie. \\"U.N. Owen\\" was a mysterious figure known to scheme people in the novel. Perfect Cherry Blossom ; *Species: Yuki- onna *Ability: Manipulation of chilliness :Stage 1 boss. She is a y≈çkai who only appears during winter. In Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, it was written that she was a type of yuki-onna. :She is fairly tall. :She possesses an ability to manipulate chilliness. According to Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, since this is equivalent to an ability that manipulates the winter within nature, she possesses tremendous power according to the environment, but she is mostly powerless outside of winter. In Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red, Letty herself said that outside of winter, she hides away in a place where \\"not a ray of sunlight can reach.\\" Her name is a reference to Letitia \\"Letty\\" Blacklock, a character from A Murder is Announced, by Agatha Christie. ; *Species: Beast (Bakeneko possessed as Shikigami) *Ability: Sorcery (while possessed as shikigami), surprising people (as bakeneko) *Residence: Y≈çkai Mountain :Stage 2 boss and Extra Stage midboss. She has two tails and is a bakeneko yokai. She is also Ran Yakumo's shikigami, but since Ran herself is a shikigami of Yukari Yakumo, she is a \\"shikigami of a shikigami\\" from Yukari's viewpoint. :She is short. :Chen, as a bakeneko, acquires powers of a wrathful god while possessed, but since the one of whom she is a shikigami of, Ran, is also a shikigami, her strength is fairly low. This shikigami possession is removed when she is soaked in water, and due to being a cat as well, she generally dislikes being in water regardless. :She ordinarily lives in Y≈çkai Mountain.

She is \\"fairly tall.\\" She wears a frilly white and blue dress, and a red headband. The color of her eyes changes with each work. :She is an all- purpose-type of magician without any major strengths or weaknesses.

It has not been long since the day she has become a magician, and because of this, she still continues human habits like eating and sleeping that aren't entirely necessary. :As her speciality is making dolls, she is also able to manipulate a great amount of dolls at the same time, and she is one of the best dollmakers in Gensokyo. She is able to make her dolls move with as much fluidity as any human, and she can make multiple dolls perform different actions, sometimes making them cooperate and sometimes making them move completely asynchronously, to such an extent that to onlookers around her, it might not seem like she is manipulating them. The dolls are also able to manipulate other dolls, but Alice does not use them to assist her when creating new dolls, opting to do it entirely herself. :She has a residence in the Forest of Magic. According to Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, since she was originally a human, even as a y≈çkai, she has a high understanding and friendship towards humans and presents a low danger level, and if someone gets lost in the forest, she gladly gives shelter. However, Alice's house is covered all over with dolls, and since she is not very eager for conversation, it seems like she immediately flees when there is something eerie. However, she is not hostile, and in Strange and Bright Nature Deity, the Three Fairies of Light accidentally arrived at her house, and Alice was hospitable to them. :According to Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, she does not perform the usual act of attacking humans, but likes fights and upon receiving a challenge to do battle, gladly accepts. As she manipulates a great number of combat dolls, the challenger is likely to be highly outnumbered, making a difficult battle inevitable, but she has the weakness of having to use her hands to manipulate the dolls, and thereby cannot engage in combat directly. :Since she does not find it enjoyable to win battles with overwhelming power, she usually fights with power that is only slightly greater than that of the opponent. Furthermore, it would be problematic were she to be defeated while putting forth the extent of her power, and so she does not give it her all in fights, in which respect she is similar to Reimu Hakurei. :In the character settings text for Imperishable Night, it was written that she was an indoors type who was often alone, but in Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, the range of her place of activities is set to \\"any kind of place\\" in Gensokyo, and she also appeared in front of people in times of festivals to exhibit her skill with dolls. Additionally, while she is reclusive in character, in the only mainline Touhou games in which she's a playable character, she fights alongside Marisa. In each ending of Imperishable Night and Immaterial and Missing Power, she participated in banquets at the Hakurei Shrine. It was also hinted that she sometimes visits the library of the Scarlet Devil Mansion.„ÄéËêÉÂ§¢ÊÉ≥„Äè„Éû„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„É¢„Éº„Éâ„ÅÆ„ÄÅ„Ç¢„É™„ÇπÂØæ„Éë„ÉÅ„É•„É™„ÉºÊà¶„Åß„ÅÆ„Ç¢„É™„Çπ„ÅÆÂãùÂà©„Çª„É™„Éï„ÄÇ :According to ZUN's comments in the Music Room of Perfect Cherry Blossom, Alice is a special character of the Touhou Series, and because of that, he composed her theme with renewed vigor. ; *Species: Fairy *Ability: Can recognise the coming of spring :A fairy that heralds the arrival of spring. However, since she expresses herself with danmaku rather than words, her announcement is usually seen as a hostile attack. She is the first midboss to receive an official character profile. In the \\"Muenzuka\\" stage of Phantasmasgoria of Flower View, a black version of Lily White shows up instead of the normal version. Fans have named her Lily Black, and gave her a darker character as opposed to the cheerful Lily White. ; *Species: Poltergeists *Ability: Playing musical instruments without hands or feet *Residence: Poltergeist Mansion :Bosses of Stage 4. They are poltergeists in the shape of three bards. They were originally daughters of a human noble, but an unfortunate event caused his four daughters to separate. The fourth daughter, Layla Prismriver, was unable to leave the mansion that held so many of her memories. Using her power, she conjured poltergeists with the appearance of her older sisters, then slowly became forgotten along with the mansion and the poltergeists. Even though the humans died with the passage of time, the poltergeists remain in the mansion. The three Prismriver Sisters, now musical performers of some note, were employed by Yuyuko Saigyouji to provide entertainment for the upcoming flower-viewing. The protagonists encounter them at the gate to the netherworld. :; :*Ability: Power to play melancholic notes ::The eldest of the Prismriver Sisters. She plays the violin and prefers solo performances. She can also play 'melancholic notes', which can bring people or y≈çkai into a state of depression, but Lyrica's playing negates this effect, meaning it only has an impact when she plays solos. Honest to a fault, she is perhaps the most well-adjusted of the sisters. The player fights her first if the player is playing as Reimu.

The player fights her first if the player is playing as Sakuya. She is fairly short. :; :*Ability: Power to play illusionary notes ::The youngest of the poltergeist Prismriver Sisters. Although skilled with all instruments, she prefers keyboard and percussion. Neither her keyboard nor her 'illusionary notes' exist in the natural world, and has no major effect beyond making the other two sisters' performance more enjoyable.

In Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red and Curiosities of Lotus Asia, she took on the responsibility for collecting and returning the yuurei that have gone to Gensokyo as a result of the thinning of the barrier of the Netherworld. ; *Species: Ghost *Age: At least 1000 years *Ability: Manipulation of death and departed souls *Residence: Hakugyokur≈ç :Final Stage boss, Stage 1 boss of Ten Desires, and a playable character in Imperishable Night, Immaterial and Missing Power, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, and Hisoutensoku. Yuyuko is the princess of the netherworld pagoda, Hakugyokur≈ç. She is a ghost, but unlike most of her kind, looks entirely human. She was a human, cursed with the power to bring death to others; this ability caused her to eventually commit suicide using her life to seal away an ancient evil residing in a y≈çkai cherry blossom tree. Living in the netherworld, she doesn't socialize much with the rest of Gensokyo, apart from her gardener Youmu, the only person she speaks to is Yukari. Her family name Saigyouji suggests relations with the famed poet Saigyo. Yuyuko, at first appearance, is a ditz; her mental processes seem to be dedicated mainly to teasing her gardener and servant, Youmu, and anticipating her next meal. However, her usual manner conceals a sharp mind and an almost prenatural depth of insight. For instance, she was the only one to perceive what sort of being Fujiwara no Mokou was at first sight. Yuyuko has the power to invoke death in any mortal; however, she rarely chooses to use it. Her danmaku are characterized by butterfly-shaped bullets. She is fairly tall. ; *Species: Shikigami (Kitsune) *Ability: Power to use shikigami *Residence: The boundaries of Gensokyo :Extra stage boss and Phantasm stage midboss. A nine- tailed fox y≈çkai whom Yukari Yakumo made her shikigami. She is considerably powerful even without her master's support. Among other things, she uses this power to maintain her own shikigami, Chen. Since Yukari sleeps twelve hours a day, she handles the work during these times. In d≈çjinshi, she is often depicted as a harassed servant, doing all of the work for her lazy master. She is fairly tall. ; *Species: Y≈çkai *Ability: Manipulation of space and boundaries *Residence: The boundaries of Gensokyo :Phantasm stage boss, and playable in Imperishable Night, Subterranean Animism, Immaterial and Missing Power, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, Hisoutensoku, and Antinomy of Common Flowers. Yukari is an elder y≈çkai who dwells on the border of Gensokyo, and may predate the existence of the realm itself. A good friend of Yuyuko and an acquaintance of Reimu, she is the self-appointed stewardess of the seal between Gensokyo and the Outside World, but doesn't do a particularly good job of it. Most of the time, she is asleep, leaving all the work to her shikigami Ran and Chen. When she isn't, she tends to amuse herself by pulling in unprepared humans from the outside world and stranding them in Gensokyo, with no apparent way for them to return. Her calculation and mathematical skills far exceeds that of Ran, being Ran's master, making her one of the most intelligent y≈çkai, and, one of the most powerful - Rinnosuke suggests that no y≈çkai or human could defeat her in battle. Her ability is the manipulation of boundaries, which refers to both physical and metaphorical boundaries, which also distinguish her spell cards. Often, though, she just summons her shikigami and various others to create her danmaku for her. She is tall. Immaterial and Missing Power ; *Species: Oni *Ability: Manipulation of density and sparseness *Residence: Gensokyo, often seen at Yokai Mountain and the Hakurei Shrine, exact location unknown :Main antagonist of Immaterial and Missing Power, a playable character in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody,and a support character to Reimu in Subterranean Animism, her only appearance in a mainline Touhou game.

As an oni, she loves drinks, feasts, and competition.Immaterial and Missing Power Despite her small size, she is physically strong, and has, speed and mystic powers to match. Using her ability to control density, she can gather people to form a banquet, or she can scatter herself to become mist. In Immaterial and Missing Power, she made the residents of Gensokyo have feasts for several consecutive days, intending to draw the joyous oni from hiding. :Suika (ËêÉÈ¶ô) is the Japanese word for watermelon, and so this became an unofficial nickname for her. Her name is likely a reference to Mount Ibuki, where the oni Shuten-d≈çji was born. Imperishable Night ; *Species: Y≈çkai firefly *Ability: Manipulation of insects *Residence: Bushes, grass :Stage 1 boss. Insects collect around her, and so she often can be seen in the middle of a swarm of them. With her powers, she can manipulate the flickerings of fireflies with timed synchronicity, or summon swarms of poisonous insects to kill an enemy. Like insects, she is afraid of pesticides and the cold. She is seen wearing a cape and pant-like bloomers, which led fans to believe she was a male. She is often seen alongside Yuuka and other insect/bug characters. ; *Species: Night sparrow *Ability: Making humans insane by singing *Residence: Road of Monsters :Stage 2 boss and playable character in Phantasmagoria of Flower View. Mystia is a night sparrow that dwells on a road near a human village. She conceals herself by blinding travelers who walk along the road at night, then lures them astray, after which point they disappear without a trace.

She cooks grilled lamprey, because, as a night sparrow, she is upset by other birds being eaten as yakitori. An incident in Imperishable Night in which she was apparently eaten by Yuyuko made her a popular joke character. However, she returned in Phantasmagoria of Flower View. ; *Species: Were-hakutaku *Ability: Power to consume history (as a human) and create history (as a hakutaku) *Residence: Human Village :Stage 3 boss. Although half-human and half-beast, she appears perfectly human, except during a full moon, when she grows horns. She was not born with therianthropy, and only became a were-hakutaku due to an unknown incident.

However, she is trigger-happy and sometimes mistakes ordinary travelers for such malicious y≈çkai. Keine opened a terakoya in the village and spends her time teaching children and compiling historical records. She seems to be good friends with Fujiwara no Mokou. ; *Species: Y≈çkai rabbit *Ability: Power to confer good luck to humans *Residence: Eientei :Stage 5 midboss and playable character in Phantasmagoria of Flower View. Based upon the \\"White Hare of Inaba\\" story of the Kojiki, she evolved into a y≈çkai from a rabbit due to her longevity. She is the leader of the earthly bunnies of the Eientei, despite her deceitful personality. She is also a lucky charm - humans who get lost in the forest can depend on her fortune to find their way, though the humans often aren't aware they can use her fortune for greater things. ; *Species: Moon rabbit *Ability: Power to manipulate insanity *Residence: Eientei :Stage 5 boss and playable character in Phantasmagoria of Flower View, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, Legacy in Lunatic Kingdom and the PlayStation 4 version of Urban Legend in Limbo.

She also has control over waves of all kinds, such as light waves, brainwaves, electromagnetic waves, as well as sound waves, demonstrated during her story in Phantasmagoria of Flower View. \\"Udongein\\" and \\"Inaba\\" are both nicknames, the first given her by Eirin and the second Kaguya; the latter is what Kaguya calls all rabbits. Despite her power over insanity, Reisen is portrayed as one of the most level-headed and serious characters in the series. :According to a series of yonkoma manga, Inaba of The Moon and Inaba of The Earth, despite the care she generally got, Reisen is often abused by her mistress Kaguya and teacher Eirin. She is also often the subject of many pranks made by Tewi. ; *Species: Human (Lunarian) *Ability: Power to create any drug, natural genius *Residence: Eientei :Boss of Final Stage A and midboss of Final Stage B. A genius pharmacist who once lived on the moon. Kaguya persuaded her to produce the forbidden Hourai Elixir‚Äîthe elixir of life‚Äîand consumed it. They were found out, but only Kaguya was punished and sent to the Earth, a fact which Eirin always felt guilty about. The Moon Court eventually pardoned Kaguya and summoned her back. Eirin and a handful of emissaries were sent to retrieve her, but Eirin found out that Kaguya didn't want to return to the moon. Acting out of her past guilt, Eirin betrayed and murdered all the other emissaries under the eyes of the earthlings who had fostered Kaguya. Eirin bribed the earthlings with the Hourai Elixir, in order to keep them silent, and went into hiding with Kaguya in Gensokyo. She is based on the Japanese goddess Omoikane. ; *Species: Human (Lunarian) *Ability: Manipulation of eternity and the instantaneous *Residence: Eientei :Boss of Final Stage B, Kaguya is actually the Princess Kaguya from The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. A princess of the moon, after consuming the forbidden Hourai Elixir and becoming immortal, she was punished by being exiled to live on the Earth.Touhou Bougetsushou official website Later, she was pardoned and ordered to return to the moon.

Mokou was the daughter of a nobleman (assumed to be Fujiwara no Fuhito), one of Kaguya's suitors during her initial exile on Earth.

She wanted to take revenge, but Kaguya disappeared before she was able to do anything, sso Mokou consoled herself by stealing the Hourai Elixir that Eirin had bribed the other humans with, and drank it to become immortal. She eventually found herself unable to remain in human society, and moved to Gensokyo, wherein she found Kaguya was also a fugitive.

Right column: Marisa, Youmu, Cirno, Merlin, Mystia, Aya, Yuuka, Sikieiki. ; *Species: Crow tengu *Ability: Manipulation of wind, exceptional speed *Residence: Y≈çkai Mountain :Playable character in Phantasmagoria of Flower View, Subterranean Animism, Double Spoiler, Hidden Star in Four Seasons, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, Hisoutensoku, and is the only playable character of Shoot the Bullet, making her the first singular playable character in a Touhou game other than Reimu, and the main character of the fanbook Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red, Stage 4 boss in Mountain of Faith, and also appears in Fairy Wars and Impossible Spell Card. Aya is the sole reporter, photographer and distributor of the Bunbunmaru Shinbun ('Sentence sentence period newspaper'). She is often serious and appears to take her job quite seriously which is at odds with her reporting, as her newspaper consists mostly of rumors, gossip and other questionably accurate stories. Despite being the only periodical newspaper available in Gensokyo, Strange and Bright Nature Deity and Curiosities of Lotus Asia suggest that it's not very well received. :Aya does not like to fight unless necessary, though she has contempt for those she thinks are weak. As a tengu, she has power over the wind and is the fasted flyer in all of Gensokyo, as well as eyesight that far exceeds that of most others. Her bullets are extremely fast compared to most. Additionally, she is one of the stronger y≈çkai in Gensokyo, and has sometimes defeated opponents when only trying to cover a news story. ; *Species: Doll *Ability: Manipulation of poison *Residence: Nameless Hill :An abandoned doll who turned into a y≈çkai after years of exposure to the poisonous lily-of-the-valleys. She advocates for doll emancipation (though other dolls are not capable of free will like she is) and dislikes humans because of their manipulation of dolls. Because of this, Sikieiki judged her to be \\"too narrow in outlook.\\" Perhaps affected by this statement, she made an alliance with Eirin Yagokoro, though she still wishes for the liberation of dolls. Her name may originate from A Medicine for Melancholy by Ray Bradbury. Additionally, the word melancholia, from which melancholy is derived, had two meanings historically, as a precursor to depression, and, in Hippocratic humoral theory, melancholia was a word for black bile. In addition to her attacks, she also spews poisonous mists on the battlefield, slowing the player's movement when the player comes into contact with them. ; *Species: Y≈çkai *Ability: Manipulation of flowers *Residence: Garden of the Sun :First appearing in Lotus Land Story, Yuuka is the second PC-98 character to appear in the Windows Touhou games, after Alice Margatroid. She also appeared in Mystic Square for the PC-98, and as a playable character in Phantasmagoria of Flower View for Windows. She loves seasonal flowers, and thus throughout the year will move to the respective places where flowers are presently growing. She has lived long enough to witness several major flower-blooming outbreaks, an event that only occurs once every sixty years, implying she's at least a few hundred years old, and Sikieiki once commented that she \\"had lived a little too long.\\" A consistent trait across all games is her slowness, either as a boss or a playable character. Yuuka carries a parasol with her, which she described as \\"the only flower in Gensokyo that never withers\\", but this may be metaphorical. ; *Species: Shinigami *Ability: Manipulation of distance *Residence: Sanzu River :Playable character in Phantasmagoria of Flower View and Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, and Final Stage Boss of Shoot The Bullet. Komachi is a shinigami who provides passage across the Sanzu River, giving her a role akin to that of Charon in Greek mythology. Despite her rather important job, she doesn't always take it seriously and ends up being scolded by her boss, Sikieiki Yamaxanadu. Her name is thought to have originated from the famed beauty Ono no Komachi. Her attacks come in the form of holed coins, in reference to the \\"price\\" one needs to pay to cross the Sanzu River. ; *Species: Yama *Ability: Power to judge clearly as good and evil *Residence: Higan :Final boss of the game, and Stage 10 Boss in Shoot The Bullet, Sikieiki is one of the judges of the underworld Her job is to judge the deceased and decide whether they get sent to Heaven, Hell, or somewhere else. As a part of her job, she can be rather moralistic and likes to talk at length about morals. \\"Siki Eiki\\" is her real name; the \\"Yamaxanadu\\" part of her name is actually her title, a combination of her status as \\"Yama\\" and \\"Xanadu\\", the place she is in charge of. \\"Yama\\" means that she is a judge of the underworld, and \\"Xanadu\\" means paradise. Mountain of Faith Top row: Shizuha, Minoriko, Hina Middle row: Nitori, Momiji, Aya Bottom row: Sanae, Kanako, Suwako ; *Species: Goddess of red leaves (Kami) *Ability: Control of autumn leaves *Residence: Foot of the Y≈çkai Mountain :Stage 1 midboss.

As a harvest goddess, she is invited as a special guest to the harvest festival in the Human Village every year, and will not guarantee the humans a good harvest if she isn't. She can cultivate a harvest substantial enough to provide for everyone in Gensokyo, but may also destroy it if she desires. Like her sister, she is prideful and cheerful, but only during autumn. ; *Species: Curse goddess (Kami) *Ability: Gathering of misfortune *Residence: Y≈çkai Sea of Trees :Stage 2 boss. Hina is the head of the Nagashi-bina army, and gets her powers from nagashi-bina dolls which humans put their own misfortunes in and leave to float in rivers. As such, Hina is surrounded by curses and those who encounter her will run into misfortune, but she has no dislike of humans, and does not wish to see them hurt. Her danmaku is characterized by spinning, and the kanji for curse (ÂéÑ yaku), which is also seen on her dress, resembles a spiral. ; *Species: Kappa *Ability: Manipulation of water *Residence: Untrodden Valley :Stage 3 boss, also appearing as an enemy boss in Impossible Spell Card, and a playable character in Subterranean Animism, Hopeless Masquerade, Antinomy of Common Flowers and Urban Legend in Limbo. An engineer with an interest in humans, she believes that the kappa and the humans were ancient allies. In-universe, the kappa are a race with advanced technology, demonstrated when the shy Nitori uses optical camouflage to conceal herself from the humans. As an engineer, she likes to disassemble and reassemble technology to understand how it works, but she is not able to make any tools of her own with magical properties. To carry all her engineering tools, Nitori is seen with a huge backpack, several times larger than her own back. ; *Species: White wolf tengu *Ability: Power to see a thousand ri ahead *Residence: Waterfall of Nine Heavens :Stage 4 midboss, also appearing in Impossible Spell Card and Double Spoiler. A loyal tengu who patrols the Y≈çkai Mountain and can see from distances up to one thousand ri (3,900KM or 2,400 miles) away. She attempts to scare intruders off with simple attacks before reporting them to her superiors. When not on duty, she plays dai shogi with the kappa who live nearby. During the events of Mountain of Faith, she failed to scare Reimu and Marisa away, so she was assigned under Aya Shameimaru to continue surveillance on the intruders. Her report led to the peaceful resolution of the tension between the tengu and the Moriya Shrine. ; *Species: Human, distant descendant of the goddess Suwako Moriya *Ability: Power to cause miracles *Residence: Moriya Shrine :Stage 5 boss and priestess (miko) of the Moriya Shrine, and a playable character in Subterranean Animism, Undefined Fantastic Object, Ten Desires, and Hisoutensoku. Though she is human, she is descended from Suwako and has the power to create miracles due to her divine blood. In the past, people began to worship her as a living god due to these miracles, despite the fact that she was the priestess of another god and most of the miracles were her god's. Gradually, faith in both Sanae and her god Kanako declined and they chose to move their shrine to Gensokyo. In an attempt to gather the faith of Gensokyo's residents, she threatened to close down the Hakurei Shrine, which resulted in a resounding defeat for her and her gods. In Gensokyo, her status is only that of a regular human. :Sanae is a rarity as she is both an outsider to Gensokyo as well as a human, and though there have been multiple characters who've come from the Outside World, only Sanae appears to have an understanding of popular culture, in once incident referencing mecha anime. Due to her position, she has trouble adjusting to life in Gensokyo, and is largely contemptuous towards y≈çkai. She has long, green hair with a frog head hair clip. Somewhat similar to Reimu, her outfit resembles a hakama with detached sleeves, leaving the armpits exposed, but Sanae's is white and blue. She also carries a gohei, but the paper decorations are rectangular, compared to the more irregular shape of Reimu's. ; *Species: Goddess of wind and rain (Kami) *Ability: Power to create qian *Residence: Wind God's Lake :Stage 6 boss, also appearing in Subterranean Animism, Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom, Double Spoiler, Impossible Spell Card, and as a playable character in Hisoutensoku. Officially, a goddess of the mountain who inhabits the Moriya Shrine, but in reality a goddess of wind and rain. She is based on the Japanese god Yasakatome no Mikoto. As faith in gods in the Outside World declined, she decided to move from the Moriya Shrine to Gensokyo's Y≈çkai Mountain, to avoid being forgotten. She quickly acquired faith from the y≈çkai on the mountain ‚Äî though it did have elements making it closer to a state of friendship. To acquire the faith of the humans and y≈çkai living elsewhere in Gensokyo, she sent her priestess Sanae to the Hakurei Shrine. She wears a snake-patterned shimenawa as her trademark, symbolizing her victory over Suwako long ago, in addition to removable pillars on her back. In the events before Subterranean Animism, she was the one that sent the Yatagarasu to Utsuho Reiuji so Kanako and Suwako could start their Mountain Industrial Revolution project using nuclear fusion power with the kappa. The project was a complete success. :Kanako is ambitious, and continually tries to increase her faith in any way that she can. Somewhat unusually for a deity, she does not demand formality in her worship, and is largely open towards science, to the extent that she wishes to transition towards being a goddess of technological innovation. She has no hostility towards humans, but will curse them, should they act disrespectfully. :Her ability is to produce a single Qian (‰πæ), one of the eight elements (Bagua) of Taoism, which is associated with creation, leadership and reliability. She is also called a 'wind god', which would suggest an ability to alter the terrain and weather, and alongside Suwako, she has been seen creating large structures and opening holes into the underground. ; *Species: Goddess of mountains (Kami) *Ability: Power to create kun *Residence: Moriya Shrine :Extra Stage boss, also appearing in Subterranean Animism, Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom, Double Spoiler, Impossible Spell Card and as a playable character in Hisoutensoku. She is the original goddess of the Moriya Shrine, and once the leader of Mishaguji, but was later defeated by Kanako. However, the people of her kingdom still feared Mishaguji and were unable to accept Kanako as their new goddess. The two created a false god, \\"Moriya\\", from which they could both gather faith. Kanako borrowed Suwako's powers, and silently ruled as the goddess of mountain. Already long forgotten in the Outside World, Suwako was untroubled as her faith slowly declined, but accompanied Kanako to Gensokyo nonetheless ‚Äî despite their history, and their frequent disagreements, the two are good friends. Suwako is notable for her frog motif, and though, Cirno likes to freeze frogs, much to Suwako's annoyance, there is no major animosity between the two. :Suwako's personality is somewhat opposite to Kanako - she is laid back, and does not appear to be affected by how much faith she has. Additionally, she enjoys competition, but does not leave the shrine often. Her ability is to create Kun (Âù§), which is associated with acceptance, subtlety, and flexibility. Mountain of Faith displays rather little of her power, but in Hisoutensoku, she can summon magma, geysers, grow plants instantly, and bend rivers. Scarlet Weather Rhapsody ; *Species: Y≈çkai oarfish *Ability: Power to read the atmosphere *Residence: Sea of Abstruse Clouds :Sub-boss of Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, and Stage 10 boss in Double Spoiler. An ambassador from the Dragon Palace who came to warn Gensokyo of an upcoming calamity. She is a lightning user, and most of her combat abilities center around lightning and her long scarf. In her official profile in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, it is said that \\"she can read the mood of a place, and adapt to it right away. She doesn't try to break the mood unless there's a very urgent reason. Flexibility is stronger than stiffness. When necessary, she vanishes completely and parries any attack.\\" ; *Species: Celestial *Ability: Manipulation of Earth *Residence: Bhava-agra (Naivasa·πÉj√±ƒÅnƒÅsa·πÉj√±ƒÅyatana) :Boss of Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, Double Spoiler and Impossible Spell Card, and is also a playable character in Antinomy of Common Flowers. Tenshi is a celestial with a \\"sheltered upbringing\\", but not entirely aware of this fact herself. She is overconfident, does not consider how her actions affect others, and is sensitive to insults, but ZUN described her as \\"nice\\", and that Scarlet Weather Rhapsody was \\"all about others bullying her.\\" Bored with her life in Heaven, and envious of y≈çkai creating incidents, she creates one of her own in Gensokyo by using her powers, along with stealing the Hisou-no-Tsurugi (\\"Scarlet Disposition Sword\\"), which has the ability to absorb the disposition of others in the form of a mist, manipulating the weather. She is adept at the manipulation of rock and earth: she can throw rocks like a projectile, and raise the earth around or in front of herself. Additionally, she is remarkably strong, likely because of the peaches she ate in Heaven, which have magical properties. Tenshi's name can have multiple meanings depending on how it is read - Tenshi (Â§©Â≠ê) literally means 'Child of Heaven', and it can also be interpreted as 'Angel' (Â§©‰Ωø). Hinanawi (ÊØîÈÇ£ÂêçÂ±Ö) can be read as 'The Goddess of Earthquake'. Subterranean Animism ; *Species: Tsurube-otoshi *Ability: Dropping onibi *Residence: Fantasy Wind Cave :Stage 1 midboss. A bashful y≈çkai who likes dark and confined spaces, and suddenly drops from high places to attack. She appears in a well bucket and it is believed she rarely, if ever, leaves this. Her name is written in katakana as, according to ZUN, kanji would \\"make her seem too strong.\\" As she has no official dialogue, and a sparse character profile, very little is known about her. ; *Species: Tsuchigumo *Ability: Manipulation of illness *Residence: Fantasy Wind Cave :Stage 1 boss. A cave-dwelling spider y≈çkai who is cheerful and enjoys fighting. Her ability is to spread disease, generally of the infectious sort, which is especially dangerous to humans, however she prefers not to use her ability unless needed. Her design resembles a spider - the shape of her dress resembles that of a spider and her buttons look like an extra three pairs of eyes. Furthermore, the name Yamame (ÂÖ´„ÅæÁõÆ) can be translated as 'Eight Eyes.' ; *Species: Hashihime *Ability: Manipulation of jealousy *Residence: Deep Road to Hell :Stage 2 boss. A bridge princess who lives on the route to Former Hell. She is perpetually jealous, to an irrational degree - even being jealous of those who are worse off than her. Though she may appear to others as quite normal, internally she is consumed by jealousy, and the only seemingly practical use for this ability is seeing the lives of humans ruined by it, from her influence. Parsee's boss theme is \\"Green-Eyed Jealousy\\", named after her own green eyes, and in Double Spoiler her title is \\"The Green-Eyed Monster.\\" These are both descriptions of jealousy from The Merchant of Venice and Othello, respectively. ; *Species: Oni *Ability: Exceptional strength, unexplainable phenomena *Residence: Former Streets of Hell (Ancient City) :Stage 3 boss, also appearing in Double Spoiler. One of the \\"Four Devas of the Mountain\\" along with Suika Ibuki, she is referred to as \\"Yuugi the Powerful\\" within the four, due to her unmatched strength. As well as her physical prowess, it's been suggested she can produce heat by moving her hand, and flatten trees by screaming. She possesses \\"unexplainable phenomena\\", which comes from the Analects of Confucius, precisely what this consists of is unknown, but the Analects speak of \\"anomalies, strength, disorder, and spirits.\\" Originally from the Y≈çkai Mountain, she and the other oni moved underground when humans began to shun the oni. Yuugi continues her cheerful sake-drinking life in the Ancient City of Former Hell, and carries a sake dish named the Hoshiguma Dish, which raises the quality of any sake that is poured into it. She is cheerful and energetic, and has little tolerance for the weak. Yuugi is unusually tall, has long, blonde hair, and a red horn coming out of her forehead. She wears a white shirt with a long, blue skirt, and has broken chains attached to her wrists and ankles. The name Yuugi may be in reference to 'courage' (ÂãáÂäõ) seen in 'strength', as seen in \\"anomalies, strength, disorder and spirits.\\" (ÊÄ™Âäõ‰π±Á•û). ; *Species: Satori *Ability: Mind reading, hypnosis *Residence: Palace of the Earth Spirits :Stage 4 boss, stage 9 boss in Double Spoiler, and the protagonist of the manga Foul Detective Satori. Satori became the Mistress of the Palace of the Earth Spirits after the underground city was separated from Hell. Satori has the ability to read the hearts and minds of any living creature, and while most y≈çkai and humans are wary of her because of this, she is loved by animals, who normally can't be understood by anyone, and keeps many of them as pets. Little is known about her actual personality, largely due to the fact she is ostracized and so does not interact much with anyone else in Gensokyo. She also has some limited hypnotic abilities, which can bring traumatic memories to the forefront of someone's mind, or induce amnesia. During the events of Subterranean Animism, the Heroine invaded her home from above ground. After an encounter, Satori permitted the Heroine passage towards the Hell of Blazing Fires. ; *Species: Kasha *Ability: Carrying corpses, communicating with spirits *Residence: Remains of the Blazing Hell :A two-tailed cat who shows up as a midboss in stage 4 and 5, and turns into humanoid form as the stage 5 boss and Final Stage midboss. Rin (nicknamed Orin in the game) is one of Satori's pets, whose job is to carry corpses to the former Hell of Blazing Fires to regulate its heat, which she does with a wheelbarrow, and though it holds no special properties of its own, is described as \\"likely to have carried the most corpses in all of history.\\" She also has the ability to communicate with the dead, and other ghostly spirits, and in combat can briefly reanimate corpses. :Before the events of Subterranean Animism, Rin learned of her old friend Utsuho's newly acquired power, and of her plans to conquer the above ground. She got terrified at the thought of her friend's future, and the punishment her mistress would impart on her (even though Satori never intended to, it was merely Rin's own paranoia). She decided to drive the evil spirits to above ground to lure the y≈çkai in and get them to help her, but instead the Heroine appeared before her, and when she was stronger than Rin expected, she asks the Heroine to help her and stop Utsuho. ; *Species: Hell raven with Yatagarasu *Ability: Manipulation of nuclear fusion *Residence: Deepest sector of the Underground City :Final Stage boss, stage 8 boss in Double Spoiler, and a playable character in Hisoutensoku. Utsuho (sometimes Okuu) is one of Satori's pets, a Hell raven who has lived in the underground world for longer than its separation from Hell. Her job is to regulate the flames of the Hell of Blazing Fires. Before the events of Subterranean Animism, she was told by a voice (presumably Kanako Yasaka's) that she could swallow the god, yatagarasu, that was hidden in the flames to gain a power that would fulfill the wishes of both the worlds below and above the surface, the power in question being nuclear fusion. Utsuho decided that using these powers, she would take over Gensokyo. Her friend, Rin Kaenbyou, became worried about Utsuho, and drove evil spirits to the surface to cause an incident among the strong y≈çkai above ground, hoping that they would come down to do something about it and, when they got there, they ultimately defeated Utsuho and brought her back to her former self. Contrary to their to expectations, it was a human that came, and not a y≈çkai. :She is sometimes called ‚ë• (an inverted ‚ë®) because she seems to have a simple and boastful personality, and is called a birdbrain by Orin. In d≈çjinshi and other fan material, this leads to comparisons (or pairings) with Cirno. ; *Species: Satori *Ability: About enough power to manipulate the unconscious *Residence: Moriya Shrine :Extra Stage boss, stage 9 boss in Double Spoiler, and a playable character in Hopeless Masquerade, Urban Legend in Limbo, and Antinomy of Common Flowers. Like her elder sister Satori, Koishi was born with the power to read other people's minds. However, Koishi knew this power of hers would make people feel uneasy around her, so she deliberately closed off this power (which dulled Satori's power as well). She sealed away her own mind to others in doing so, and even her sister would not be able to read her mind. Satori took pity on her, and gave some pets to Koishi, hoping that the animals would open Koishi's heart to others. The plan worked, and Koishi started to care for her pets, and would one day set out to seek the god who gave Utsuho power so that her own pets could use it too. Undefined Fantastic Object ; *Species: Mouse y≈çkai *Age: At least 1000 years *Ability: Power to find sought-for objects *Residence: The Road of Lingering Snow (Stage 1), Makai (Stage 5) :Stage 1 boss and stage 5 mid-boss. Being a leader of mice and a natural dowser, Nazrin was commanded by Syou to search for the shards that fell from the sky and the Jeweled Pagoda of Bishamonten, but her dowsing rods brought her to the humans instead. Nazrin is easily frightened, and flees at the first sight of danger. She can use her dowsing rod to search for anything, provided she has a proper internal image of what it is, however food is the singular exception to this, as the other mice under her command would eat it before she could find any. ; *Species: Kasa-obake *Ability: Surprising humans, blacksmithing *Residence: Skies of Gensokyo (Undefined Fantastic Object), Myouren Temple Graveyard (Ten Desires) :Stage 2 boss, Extra Stage mid-boss of Undefined Fantastic Object, and stage 3 mid-boss of Ten Desires. Kogasa was once an umbrella who was forgotten for a long time and thus became an obake. Beyond blacksmithing, Kogasa's only ability to speak of is surprising humans, but holds no malice towards them. She is generally happy, but can quickly grow depressed if things do not go her way - she has low self-esteem, and is annoyed when people don't take her seriously, and will often contemplate if she's better off foregoing her consciousness and going back to being an umbrella. Ultimately, she just wants to feel wanted, but is held back by her lackluster ability. The name Kogasa (Â∞èÂÇò) means 'little umbrella', and Tatara (Ë∏èÈû¥) is the traditional Japanese method of smelting iron. She carries an umbrella that resembles a Kasa-obake, and is the only Touhou character with heterochromia: her left eye is blue, and her right one is red. ; *Species: Y≈çkai and Ny≈´do *Age: At least 1000 years *Ability: Ny≈´d≈ç *Residence: Myouren Temple :Stage 3 boss, stage 5 boss in Double Spoiler, and a playable character in Hopeless Masquerade, Urban Legend in Limbo and Antinomy of Common Flowers.Ichirin Kumoi is a former human turned ny≈´d≈ç user that the heroine encounters at the Palanquin Ship, which she guards alongside Unzan. Ny≈´d≈ç (ÂÖ•ÈÅì) is a Japanese term which literally means \\"entering the road\\", and is often used to refer to monks who have entered the road towards the path of Buddha. In the context of Touhou, it refers to Ichirin's ability to control her partner, Unzan, who will fire the danmaku for her, although the spell card \\"Electrified Ny≈´d≈ç\\" has Ichirin firing it herself. :Ichirin was once a human, but came into contact with the man-eating foreseeing ny≈´d≈ç, Unzan. Ichirin repelled by shouting \\"The foreseeing ny≈´d≈ç was foreseen!\\", which would normally make him disappear, but he was impressed by her courage and devoted the rest of his life towards protecting her. Over time, Ichirin's fear of y≈çkai ceased, which caused her to become shunned by other humans, and eventually became a y≈çkai herself. Her and Unzan are always seen together, and they reside in the Myouren Temple. Ichirin wears a headdress and kesa, giving her the appearance of a traditional Buddhist monk. ; *Species: Ship ghost *Ability: Causing shipwrecks *Residence: Inside the Palanquin Ship :Murasa is the stage 4 boss, the spirit of the former captain of the Palanquin Ship, which she drowned in. She now sinks any ships she comes across, but her ability is limited by the fact Gensokyo has no seas. Despite her rather morbid ability, she is still capable of empathising with humans, and is careful with who she chooses to drown. She wears a standard serafuku with a sailor hat, and carries an anchor. ; *Species: Tiger y≈çkai *Age: At least 1000 years *Ability: Gathering of treasures *Residence: Formerly Makai (Above Hokkai), currently Myouren Temple. :Syou is the stage 5 boss, and is an avatar of the god Bishamonten. Alongside the rest of the y≈çkai aboard the Palanquin Ship, she seeks to revive Byakuren Hijiri. She is generally dignified, but displays a wider array of emotion when among close friends. Her ability is to gather treasures, and she can use gems in combination with the Jeweled Pagoda to fire lasers which can eviscerate anything it hits, or create more gems, but most of her power comes from the Pagoda, and is quite weak physically compared to other y≈çkai. As a priest of the Myouren Temple, she is subject to worship. ; *Species: Magician, formerly human *Age: Over 1100 years *Ability: Magic *Residence: Formerly Hokkai, currently the Myouren Temple. :Stage 6 boss, stage 12 boss in Double Spoiler, stage 10 boss in Impossible Spell Card, and a playable character in Hopeless Masquerade, Urban Legend in Limbo, and Antinomy of Common Flowers. Byakuren is a Buddhist monk characterized by her serenity and dislike of conflict, making her liked by pacifistic y≈çkai. She is the chief priestess of the Myouren Temple, and teaches dharma to those who listen to her, and hopes to try and bring peace between humans and y≈çkai. Additionally, she manages funerals, and performs monthly sutra chant concerts, which both humans and y≈çkai attend. :Her magic is primarily focused on enhancing her physical abilities, in particular, strength, speed, and senses, but when not under the effects of magic, these are all on a level comparable to that of a regular human. Byakuren possesses the Sorcerer's Sutra Scroll, which contains the sutras she needs to perform her magic. It is able to recite spells on its own, can hold an infinite number of sutras, does not deteriorate, and can only be used by Byakuren. The name Byakuren (ÁôΩËìÆ) can mean white lotus (the white lotus being a symbol of purity), and Hijiri (ËÅñ) can mean saint, making one possible reading of her name Saint of the White Lotus. Additionally, the White Lotus was a sect of Buddhism that became influential in China during the 13th century. ; *Species: Nue *Age: More than 800 years *Ability: Making objects unidentifiable *Residence: Myouren Temple :Nue is the Extra Stage boss, also appearing as a sphere of light in stages 4 and 6, and as a boss in Double Spoiler and Extra Stage midboss in Ten Desires. Her ability is to conceal the nature of an object, making it look different to any person who looks at it, and she can also use this ability to disguise herself. She enjoys confusing people this way, and avoids letting people find out her actual appearance. Nue has several red wings, blue tails, carries a trident, and has a snake on her right arm. She wears a black dress, paired with black thigh-high socks, making her the first Touhou character to feature zettai ry≈çiki. The name Houjuu (Â∞ÅÁç£) means 'sealed beast', likely in reference to the fact she conceals her true nature. Double Spoiler ; *Species: Crow tengu *Ability: Thoughtography *Residence: Y≈çkai Mountain :Boss of Double Spoiler and a player character. She is upbeat and has a laid-back personality, but hates going outside and working. She writes the Kakashi Spirit News, which she gets information for using her power of thoughtography, and is the only rival to Aya's Bunbunmaru Newspaper. While her newspaper is more thoughtfully written than Aya's, Hatate's dislike of work, combined with the fact that her thoughtography requires information to have already been heard (rather than acquiring it first-hand), new publications are much slower. Because of the business rivalry between them, Hatate has a strong hatred of Aya. Fairy Wars Fairy Wars does not introduce any new characters, but three characters from the manga Eastern and Little Nature Deity and Strange and Bright Nature Deity do appear. ; *Species: Fairy *Ability: Refraction of light *Residence: Forest of Magic :A cheerful fairy who likes to play pranks on humans, usually in the form of getting them lost. She manipulates the power of the sun, namely the power to control reflection, with which can make things appear to be invisible, but is evidently reliant on the sun, and less effective in the presence of rain. She lives with Luna Child and Star Sapphire in a tree house close to the Hakurei Shrine, and the trio often go out to prank humans. Sunny and her accomplices are from the manga Eastern and Little Nature Deity and Strange and Bright Nature Deity. ; *Species: Fairy *Ability: Muting sound *Residence: Forest of Magic :Luna is a fairy whose ability is to mute sound, but uses the moon, making her vulnerable when it's not present in the sky. She is clumsy and has the most human traits of any fairy, as she likes to read, and tries to engage in logical thinking, but ironically is the stupidest of the three fairies. ; *Species: Fairy *Ability: Detection of movement *Residence: Forest of Magic :Unlike the other two fairies, Star's ability relies on the stars, which means her strength is consistent, as unlike the sun or moon, the stars are always present. She is able to detect movement of any sort from afar, but precisely from what distance is unknown. She is the most level-headed of the three, though she still enjoys pranking others just as much, but she is selfish, sometimes using her companions as bait to make an escape. She has a mushroom bonsai tree. Ten Desires ; *Species: Yamabiko *Ability: Reflection of sound *Residence: Myouren Temple :Stage 2 boss. Kyouko Kasodani is a y≈çkai who can reflect sound waves, which allows her to create a danmaku from compressed air - Japanese legend says that echoes are the result of yamabiko manipulating the sound themselves. She is a priest in training at the Myouren Temple, and is one of its newer members. The name Kyouko (ÈüøÂ≠ê) means 'echo child', and Kasodani (ÂπΩË∞∑) means 'ghost valley'. ; *Species: Jiangshi *Ability: Eating anything *Residence: Myouren Temple Graveyard :Stage 3 and Stage 4 boss, alongside Seiga Kaku. She is under the effects of an anti-decomposition spell, to prevent her body from rotting, but is majorly lacking in cognitive ability compared to a human. Her ability is to eat anything, and gain sustenance from it. Her name is likely derived from Miyako no Yoshika, a 9th Century Japanese scholar, who according to legend, 100 years after becoming a hermit, was spotted in the mountains, his face entirely unchanged. ; *Species: Hermit *Age: Over 1400 years *Ability: Passing through walls *Residence: Myouren Temple Graveyard :Stage 4 boss, alongside Yoshika Miyako. Seiga Kaku is a Taoist hermit who tries to convert others at any opportunity. She is generally malign, manipulating others for her own benefit, such as when she revived Yoshika, her de facto pet. Similarly, she uses her ability to pass through walls to steal others' belongings and then sell them back to them. The name Kaku (Èúç) is Chinese, which, combined with the fact she is not native to Gensokyo, can be taken to presume she is most likely Chinese. ; *Species: Ghost *Ability: Creating thunder and lightning *Residence: Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum :Stage 5 midboss, one of Toyosatomimi no Miko's servants. Soga no Tojiko comes from the Soga clan, and is a vengeful spirit who uses thunder and lightning, both as a result of anger and as part of her danmaku. She has a short temper, and the fact she is prone to anger in the first place makes her rather unlike Mononobe no Futo, but she is able to control her emotions when speaking to her friends. The name Soga (ËòáÊàë) is taken from the Soga clan, an influential clan of the Asuka period of Japan, until they were overthrown by the Fujiwara clan in the Isshi Incident, 645. However, the name can also mean 'ego awakening', and Tojiko (Â±†Ëá™Âè§) means 'ancient carcass'. ; *Species: Taoist, self-identifies as a shikaisen\\" *Age: Over 1400 years *Ability: Manipulation of Feng shui *Residence: Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum :Stage 5 boss, one of Toyosatomimi no Miko's servants. Mononobe no Futo is a shikaisen (shijie xian), a hermit whose living body was strengthened by taking on qualities of the dead, and as a shikaisen, she is able to take on many potential forms, but largely chooses to retain the same appearance she had as a human. Mononobe is old-fashioned, unable to adapt to new ways of life, and she speaks in an archaic manner. Though she sometimes has trouble understanding others, she is kind-hearted, even if at times hostile towards y≈çkai. She has the ability to manipulate feng shui, the flow of qi, giving her control of water, fire and the wind. Mononobe's name likely comes from the Mononobe clan. ; *Species: Saint *Age: 1446 years (born 7 February, 574) *Ability: Listening to ten people speak simultaneously *Residence: Divine Spirit Mausoleum :Stage 6 boss. A Saint living inside the Hall of Dreams' Mausoleum. She is easygoing, and does not appear to take things very seriously, nor does she attempt to try and aggressively convert others to her faith. Though relaxed, she is respectful of others and friendly towards humans. Her ability to listen to ten people at once is reliant on desires (and is the origin of the name Ten Desires), as she was completely unable to understand Youmu Konpaku, who had no desire of life or death, which would suggest rather than listen to people directly, she identifies their desires, and responds to those, rather than their words. Her character design is largely based on Prince Sh≈çtoku, and is the only Touhou character whose exact birth date has been officially revealed. The name Toyosatomimi no Miko (Ë±äËÅ°ËÄ≥Á•ûÂ≠ê) is derived from one of the names given to Prince Sh≈çtoku in the Nihon Shoki, Umayato-no-toyotomimi-no-miko (Âé©Êà∏Ë±äËÅ°ËÄ≥ÁöáÂ≠ê). ; *Species: Tanuki *Ability: Disguise *Residence: Myouren Temple :Extra Stage boss. An easygoing yet confident bake-danuki who speaks like an old woman. Mamizou has the ability to disguise herself and the objects around her. She is able to affect them directly, unlike Nue who merely obfuscates peoples' perception. However, she cannot hide her smell, which can leave her compromised. Mami, as seen in Mamizou's name, can be read in two ways, as ÁåØ, meaning tanuki, or È≠îÈ≠Ö, meaning 'deceiving spirit'. Hopeless Masquerade ; *Species: Menreiki *Age: About 1300 years *Ability: Manipulation of emotions *Residence: Unknown, only seen in the Human Village during the Final Stage. :Stage 7 Boss, and a playable character in Urban Legend in Limbo and Antinomy of Common Flowers. A Menreiki who was born from the 66 masks that were created by Toyosatomimi no Miko, who later made the Mask of Hope for her own usage. Kokoro cannot express her emotions with her own face, and uses the masks for this purpose. While she has control of the masks (and thereby her emotions) when they are in her possession, should she lose a mask, she will no longer be able to control it, nor experience that emotion herself. After the events of the game, she grows less reliant on the masks and is able to develop a sense of self. Kokoro once lost her Mask of Hope, which caused her to lose all hope and made her dependent on others, but returned to normal once she acquired another one. This mask fell into Koishi's hands, and Kokoro resents Koishi, who refuses to give it back. Double Dealing Character ; *Species: Mermaid *Ability: Increase in strength when in water *Residence: Misty Lake :Stage 1 Boss. Wakasagihime is a Mermaid yokai who lives in Misty Lake. She is mostly timid, and most of the other characters are surprised to see her taking an offensive stance. She is strengthened when submerged in water, which may explain why others do not see her acting aggressively. The name Wakasagihime is derived from the wakasagi, a Japanese fish. ; *Species: Rokurokubi *Ability: Detaching her head, flying *Residence: Human Village :Stage 2 Boss. A Rokurokubi who can detach her head from the rest of her body, and fly it when in this state. Sekibanki is slightly prideful, but does not take any effort to prove herself, and usually leaves others alone. Though she is a rokurokubi, they only have the ability to stretch their necks to an extent much greater than a human, with the complete removal of the head being a trait of the distinct nukebuki. Sekibanki appears to share characteristics of both, as while she can remove her head, she has the elongated neck of a rokurokubi. Additionally, rokurokubi have symbols on their necks indicating precisely from which point the head detaches, revealing their identity, and it is likely that Sekibanki covers up her neck for this reason. The name Sekibanki is spelled with the characters Ëµ§ËõÆÂ•á, meaning 'red barbarian anomaly'. Ban (ËõÆ) is likely taken from hitouban (È£õÈ†≠ËõÆ), a Chinese creature similar to the rokurokubi, with hitouban meaning 'flying head barbarians'. ; *Species: Werewolf *Ability: Transforming into a wolf on a full moon *Residence: Bamboo Forest of the Lost :Stage 3 Boss. A werewolf with a calm temperament, who can transform into a wolf on a full moon, likely a Honshu wolf, a species that has gone extinct in the Outside World. The name Kagerou (ÂΩ±Áãº) means 'shadow wolf', and Imaizumi (‰ªäÊ≥â) is the same surname as that of Yoshinori Imaizumi, a Japanese zoologist who researched the Honshu wolf. ;Tsukumo Sisters *Species: Tsukumogami *Ability: Making sound, performing music without instruments *Residence: Storm in the Skies of Gensokyo :Both Benben and Yatsuhashi Tsukumo are bards who were once musical instruments in the Outside World, but came to Gensokyo. When the Miracle Mallet was used, its magical power flooded into them, and they both became tsukumogami at around the same time. However, they quickly learned where their power was coming from (the Shining Needle Castle) and decided to overthrow society as tools, with similar motivations to Seija Kijin. Though called the Tsukumo sisters, they do not share a bloodline, but rather they both came sentient at the same time. :; ::Stage 4A Boss and Stage 4B Midboss. Benben is calm and collected, making her opposite to her sister. :; ::Stage 4B Boss and Stage 4A Midboss. As can be inferred, she is loud and energetic, unlike her sister. She uses her dress as a Koto to summon attacks. ; *Species: Amanojaku *Ability: Upturning anything *Residence: Shining Needle Castle :Stage 5 Boss. An amanojaku who guards the Shining Needle Castle and serves as the main antagonist of the game, with her attempt to try and overthrow Gensokyo, in which she planned to give the poor and weak more power. Seija is extremely misanthropic, deliberately opposing others at any opportunity, which in turn has made her hated by others, but she enjoys being hated. Her ability is to completely turn over anything she encounters, reflected in her Spell Cards which allow her to rotate the player's screen, disorienting them. ; *Species: Inchling *Ability: Can use the Miracle Mallet *Residence: Shining Needle Castle :Stage 6 Boss. Sukuna is an inchling, a species of small humans, the most recognised one being Issun-b≈çshi, and Sukuna is one of his descendants. She can use the Miracle Mallet, a family heirloom, which allows its user to grant wishes at a cost, but it can only be wielded by other inchlings. In the events of the game, Sukuna uses it to increase her height, bringing her to a size comparable to a human child, but caused magical energy to be leaked into Gensokyo, resulting in disruption. She has a complex surrounding her height, and speaks in a childlike manner. ; *Species: Tsukumogami *Ability: Can make anything follow a rhythm *Residence: Storm in the Skies of Gensokyo :Extra Stage Boss. A Tsukumogami made from a Taiko drum who utilises the magic energy of drummers from the Outside World, and is seen with a drum set. She acquired magical power from the Miracle Mallet, but removed this power to become self-sufficient, recognising that this power would not last forever. She believes in freedom, and is helpful towards other tools (such as the Tsukumo sisters) in letting them acquire freedom for themselves. The name Raiko (Èõ∑Èºì) consists of the kanji for 'thunder' and 'drum'. Urban Legend in Limbo ; *Species: Ibaraki-d≈çji *Age: Over 1000 years *Ability: Communicating with animals, remotely controlling her arm, guiding y≈çkai, hiding her home with fangshi, creating light orbs, instant movement, creating barriers to and from the Outside World *Residence: Y≈çkai Mountain, also seen at the Hakurei Shrine :Playable character, and the title character of the manga Wild and Horned Hermit. Little is known about her past beyond the fact she is one of the Sages of Gensokyo (the others being Yukari and Okina), who created Gensokyo and separated it from the Outside World, and, according to the Bunbunmaru, she was acknowledged at Y≈çkai Mountain as early as 1980. Kasen has perhaps the largest number of abilities of any Touhou character, and she remarked to Reimu that her abilities are a \\"secret\\", suggesting that there may be hidden powers she has yet to demonstrate. However, the confirmed abilities include communicating with and guiding animals, removing her artificial arm and allowing it to act independently from the rest of her body, guiding y≈çkai, using fangshi and hermit sorcery to hide her home, producing light orbs of greatly variable size, being able to move instantly, opening and closing the Hakurei Barrier at will, and she has claimed that she never uses her full strength when fighting Reimu as it would be 'risky.' Additionally, she owns the Ibaraki Box of a Hundred Medicines, which can cure any illness or injury from whoever drinks it, and if the drinker is healthy, then they will gain superhuman strength, but temporarily act like an oni. ; *Species: Human *Age: 15‚Äì16 years *Ability: Levitation, pyrokinesis (control of fire), hydrokinesis|hydrokinesis (control of water), telekinesis, psychokinesis, teleportation *Residence: Kant≈ç, Japan, Outside World :Final boss who becomes a playable character, also a playable character in Antinomy of Common Flowers.

She carries Zener cards and a Liberator. The name Sumireko (Ëè´Â≠ê) means 'violet child', meaning both her and Renko Usami ('lotus child') are named after flowers.

Nothing is known about Junko's origin, but she appears to be Chinese. She wears a liangbatou, which is Chinese in origin, and ZUN said \\"Junko is a character to be contrasted with Hecatia. She has more of a Chinese feel, and she seems strong in a simple way. That's it.\\" ; *Species: Goddess *Ability: Having three bodies in a single mind *Residence: Hell :Extra Stage Boss. Hecatia Lapislazuli is the goddess of Hell, and formed an alliance with Junko to invade the Moon, with the same motivation - revenge against Chang'e, whose husband, Houyi, destroyed the sun, weakening Hell. However, Junko's ability means that this grudge was not entirely belonging to Hecatia herself. She has three bodies, belonging to each world: the Outerworld, Earth and the Moon, which have red, blue and yellow hair respectively.

She and Renko form the two-person occult circle, the Secret Seals Club, which investigates Gensokyo. Descended from a long line of magicians, she is one of the few humans who can perceive and cross Gensokyo's boundaries, and can also visit it in her dreams. She also appears strikingly similar to Yukari Yakumo - their eyes and hair are both the same color, and they both wear a combination of purple and red clothing, leading some to believe they are related, which ZUN official responded to by saying \\"don't think too much about it.\\" There has been no official romanization of her name, and thus Maribel is an estimate, Merryberry and Maribelle being suggestions of possible alternatives. The name Maribel is Spanish, and Maribelle is English, which combined with the fact Renko has difficultly pronouncing her name correctly, implies that she may not be Japanese. She is from the short stories that come with ZUN's music collections. ; *Species: Half-human, half-y≈çkai *Ability: Knowing the name and utility of any tool by looking at it *Residence: Kourindou, Human Village :Rinnosuke is a half-human and the protagonist of the short story compilation Curiosities of Lotus Asia, a background character in Hopeless Masquerade, and one of the few males in Gensokyo. He runs the Kourindou, an antique store, which sells many artefacts from the Outside World, (buying them from Yukari) and is the only such place in Gensokyo that does, but he values his merchandise so highly that he never manages to make a sale, and so in actuality, his store is mostly just a place for Reimu, Marisa and Sakuya to lounge around. Marisa and Rinnosuke in particular have a good relationship, as Rinnosuke once helped out her father, who created the Mini-Hakkero for her. :Rinnosuke is perhaps one of the most peaceful residents of Gensokyo, being incapable of fighting with danmaku, and he takes caution to avoid conflict of any sort, and being half human and y≈çkai makes him liked by both. Though he was originally from the Outside World himself, he has been in Gensokyo so long that he's lost any memories of it, and as such, often has a fragmented understanding of objects - he thought a Game Boy was a doomsday device. Despite this fact, he likes to think of himself as highly knowledgeable. Most of his knowledge is conjecture, but he nonetheless will speak at length at the slightest prompt, even when the other person is most likely not listening. The name Morichika (Ê£ÆËøë) means 'near the forest', perhaps because the Kourindou is located near the Forest of Magic. Marisa's Father *Species: Human *Residence: Human Village :Father of Marisa and ordinary human. Marisa is an only child, and the two have no contact.

She has only appeared in the manga Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth and Silent Sinner in Blue. ; *Species: Lunarian *Age: At least 1500 years *Ability: Summoning power of gods, kenjutsu *Residence: Capital of the Moon :Princess of the moon, alongside her younger sister, Toyohime. She can summon the power of the gods, meaning the precise attacks she inflicts are dependent on the god that was summoned, but examples include causing lightning (from Hono-ikazuchi), using the sun (from Amaterasu), and making herself immune to bullets (from Ame-no-Uzume). Additionally, she carries a sword, and is extremely proficient with it, but the extent of this power has not been properly displayed, because it is largely outclassed by her other powers. Like her sister, she has only appeared in the manga Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth and Silent Sinner in Blue, and ZUN has said that she is too powerful to be put in any game. ; *Species: Moon rabbit *Ability: ESP *Residence: Capital of the Moon :A moon rabbit (not related to Udonge) who attempted to flee from the Moon to Earth, but was caught by Eirin Yagokoro, and as punishment for her crime, she was sentenced to be a pet for the Watatsuki sisters, who named her Reisen after their former pet, Reisen Udongein Inaba. Her original name is unknown. She can communicate with other moon rabbits using her ears in which their feelings are transmitted. She has been in Silent Sinner in Blue, Cage in Lunatic Runagate and Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth. ; *Species: Human *Ability: Deciphering books by touching them *Residence: Human Village :Kosuzu is the owner of Suzunaan, a book renting store. She was introduced as the protagonist of the manga Forbidden Scrollery. She has a generally cheerful and optimistic personality, and enjoys telling stories to local children, but overestimates her own combat ability and naively gets into situations she shouldn't, despite being easily scared.

History In 1816, the town known as Columbia Courthouse was chartered as the Town of Appling, named for the family of William Appling that had donated the land to the county and for Colonel John Appling, a local resident that had died in a campaign against the Seminoles. In the early 19th century, Appling was the political, educational, social, and religious center of Columbia County. Near Appling were located Mt. Carmel Academy and Columbia Institute. Mt. Carmel Academy was run by the famous Southern educator, Moses Waddel and it was here that John C. Calhoun and William H. Crawford were educated. Columbia Institute was started by a man pretending his last name was Bush who was actually Bushnell of revolutionary war submariner fame. In the 1830s, when the Georgia Railroad was established, it was decided that to have the trains passing near Appling would disturb the proceeding of the court, so the railway that passed through the county from Atlanta to Augusta went well below Appling. In 1855, the Courthouse in Appling received a major overhaul, and after the remodeling was complete in 1856, the building was in more or less its present form, a vernacular structure with Greek Revival and Italianate influences. Despite the extensive project, the shell of the 1809-1812 building was retained and the structure has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1980.Peggy Ussery. \\"Courthouse endures changes.\\" Augusta Chronicle. 20 April 1999.

View of the stage in the Martin Beck Theater. Martin Beck (July 31, 1868 ‚Äì November 16, 1940) was a vaudeville theatre owner and manager, and theatrical booking agent, who founded the Orpheum Circuit, and built the Palace and Martin Beck Theatres in New York City's Broadway Theatre District. He was a booking agent for, and became a close personal friend of the prominent magician, Harry Houdini. Early life Martin Beck was born to a Jewish familyKlawans, Stuart, \\"Finding an Audience: Years of Invisibility\\", Jewish Daily Forward, April 9, 2004 on July 31, 1868, in Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°, a town in northern Slovakia that at the time of his birth was ruled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He went with a group of actors on the SS Elbe from Bremen, Germany, to the United States in May 1884, where he worked as a waiter in a beer garden in Chicago, Illinois. He went to San Francisco with the Schiller Vaudeville Company, then gained citizenship in the United States in October 1889.US Passport Applications 1908, 1915, 1921 & 1922 When the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco was bought by Morris Meyerfeld Jr. in 1899, he worked with Morris to acquire more theaters. By 1905, Beck was running the organization. In 1910 he formed the United Booking Offices with Alfred Butt. Influence on career of Harry Houdini In the spring of 1899, Beck met Harry Houdini, who was then performing at a beer hall in St. Paul, Minnesota. Beck saw Houdini struggling with magic, so he made an offer, Beck telegraphed Houdini when he got to his next stop in Chicago: \\"You can open Omaha, March twenty sixth, sixty dollars, will see act probably make you proposition for all next season.\\" According to Houdini's wife when speaking to a biographer years later, this represented Houdini's big break in his professional career as a performing magician.Kellock, Harold (1928). Houdini: His Life-Story; from the recollections and documents of Beatrice Houdini, Harcourt, Brace Co. As Houdini wrote at the bottom of the telegram, which she had carefully preserved: \\"This wire changed my whole Life's journey.\\" Beck and Houdini became close personal friends. Beck advised Houdini to concentrate on his escape acts, and booked him on the Orpheum vaudeville circuit. Within months, Houdini was performing at the top vaudeville houses all over the United States, and in 1900, Beck arranged for him to tour Europe. Theatre management and ownership He built the Palace Theatre in New York City in 1913. He was voted out of the presidency of Orpheum Circuit in a boardroom coup after it went public in 1923. Later that same year, he opened the Martin Beck Theater in New York City (renamed the Al Hirschfeld Theatre in 2003). On January 28, 1928, Orpheum Circuit was merged with the theater chain started by Benjamin Franklin Keith and Edward Franklin Albee II to form Keith-Albee- Orpheum. A few months later, Joseph P. Kennedy and David Sarnoff of Radio Corporation of America merged Keith-Albee-Orpheum with Film Booking Office of America to form the Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) movie studio. In 1932 he managed the booking office at RKO. In 1934 he brought the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from London to America. Death Beck died at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan on November 16, 1940. Arthur Hopkins gave the eulogy at the funeral; honorary pall bearers included William A. Brady, John Golden, Sam H. Harris, Lawrence Langner, Guthrie McClintic, Lee Shubert and Herman Shumlin.

The church reports more than 16,000 members living in Java, Bali, Sumatra and Kalimantan. GKMI started as an indigenous Christian movement begun by a Chinese Indonesian couple by the name Tee Siem Tat and Sie Djoen Nio in the city of Kudus in north Central Java before 1920. The group identified with the Mennonite family of churches when the first believers sought baptism from Russian Mennonite missionaries working under the Dutch Mennonite Mission (Doopsgezinde Zendingsvereeniging) in the Muria area in December 1920. This group organized itself in 1925 using the Dutch language name Chineesche Doopsgezinde Christengemeente (Chinese Mennonite Congregation) and was recognized by the government of the Dutch East Indies in 1927. By the 1940s a half dozen congregations had been formed incorporating also groups of Chinese Indonesian believers who had come to faith through the ministries of the Mennonite missionaries working mostly among the Javanese population in the area. They sometimes also used the Chinese name Tiong Hwa Kie Tok Kau Hwe (Chinese Christian Church). They organized themselves into a synod called Khu Hwee Muria in 1948. By 1958 they changed the name of the synod to Persatuan Gereja-Gereja Kristen Muria Indonesia (Union of Muria Christian Churches of Indonesia). The GKMI sprang up in Chinese Indonesian communities in the towns surrounding Mount Muria, an ancient volcano along the north coast of in Central Java. Since 1960 it has spread beyond the Muria area and into other ethnic groups on the four main islands of western Indonesia.

Acalanes was the first of four high schools established in the Acalanes Union High School District. It was built in 1940 on what was then a tomato field. The school was built using Federal government funds with labor provided by the Works Project Administration, the largest and most ambitious New Deal agency introduced by the Roosevelt administration. Lafayette businessman M.H. Stanley suggested the name \\"Acalanes\\", the name of the Mexican grant from which all land title within the City of Lafayette derives. Rancho Acalanes itself seems to have been named by its Hispanic settlers after the local Native American Bay Miwok tribe called Saklan (Saclan), referred to by Spanish missionaries as Saclanes.Beeler, Madison S. 1955. Saclan. International Journal of American Linguistics 21:201-209.Beeler, Madison S. 1959. Saclan Once More. International Journal of American Linguistics 25:67-68. The first graduating class of 1941 selected the school colors of blue and white. For the school sports mascot, they chose the Don (a Spanish honorary title). Academics Acalanes offers a diverse course selection and a number of AP and honors courses. Among the electives offered are sports medicine, digital design, automechanics, graphic arts, video production, journalism, drama, photography, Mandarin (Chinese), Spanish, French, chorus, band (four groups), and orchestra. Acalanes academic clubs regularly participate in Bay Area quiz bowl tournaments, including BAAL (Bay Area Academic League). Acalanes also offers Model UN and Academic Decathlon as extracurricular activities. The Acalanes Academic Decathlon team won first place in the Contra Costa regional meet in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. They took first place in Division III at the 2009 California state competition.

Also screened was the documentary Invisible Children. Popular events during the school year include games, rallies, and weekly activities sponsored by the leadership class. The drama department puts on two plays each year, along with a yearly musical, a collaboration between the chorus and band departments. There are various chorus and band concerts throughout the year. Facilities In 1939 Acalanes was the first school designed by Ernest Kump and became the prototype for what came to be called the \\"California School\\", consisting of a complex of rectangular single-story modern buildings in parallel rows separated by gardens, with no hallways. Its openness to the outdoors and ease of expansion were revolutionary at the time, and the format was widely copied. The campus includes a track, several fields (an astro-turf field, a grass field, and a baseball field), a pool, tennis courts, two gyms, weight room, two quads, and a state-of-the-art performing arts center. Measure E bonds passed in 2008 provided for the complete renovation of the aquatic facilities, which was completed in the summer of 2011.

History In 1958, a film called My World Dies Screaming (later retitled Terror in the Haunted House) marked Hollywood's first attempt to make use of this technique. At different points in this film, a skull is flashed to inspire terror, a snake to inspire hate, two hearts to inspire love, and large letters spelling out \\"blood\\" to create fear. It was produced by William Edwards, written by Robert C. Dennis, and directed by Harold Daniels. It starred Gerald Mohr and Cathy O'Donnell. Makeup was handled by Harry Thomas, who worked on a number of Ed Wood movies in the 50s. The plot concerned a woman who is brought by her husband to live in an old house that she saw many times before in her nightmares, and she desperately tries to get him to leave the house before something terrible happens. The following year, 1959, saw another film produced using this same format, titled A Date with Death. This film also starred Gerald Mohr, coincidentally. The technique of psychorama has also been featured in more recent films, including The Exorcist and Fight Club. In the latter film, Tyler Durden splices images of pornography into family movies that play at the movie theater he works at as a part-time projectionist. The band Evanescence used this technique in their Sweet Sacrifice music video. In it, images of bones, skulls, houses, fires, and videos of the band performing are flashed at various intervals. Evanescence also utilized samples from \\"My World Dies Screaming\\" in some versions of their song \\"Understanding\\", the demo of \\"Whisper\\" and the introduction to the album Origin.

A family servant and the servant's mother and brother were hanged for killing their master, but following the man's return it became clear that no murder had taken place, despite the testimony of one of the accused. The story attracted popular attention in England in the years 1660-1662\\\\. The events were documented in a letter by Sir Thomas Overbury titled \\"A true and perfect account of the examination, confession, trial, condemnation and execution of Joan Perry, and her two sons, John and Richard Perry, for the supposed murder of Will. Harrison\\" and an accompanying letter by William Harrison detailing his whereabouts in the missing years. Disappearance On 16 August 1660 a 70-year-old man named William Harrison left his home in Chipping Campden, intending to walk two miles to the village of Charingworth. When he did not return home at the expected time his wife sent his manservant John Perry to look for him. Neither Harrison nor Perry had returned by the next morning. Edward Harrison, William Harrison's son, was then sent out to look for the pair and on his way to Charingworth he met John Perry. The servant said that he had not been able to find his master, and he and Edward continued to Ebrington, where they questioned one of the tenants whom Harrison had been going to see. The tenant said that Harrison had been there the previous night. Edward Harrison and John Perry then went to the village of Paxford, but their search proved fruitless. Edward and John then headed back to Chipping Campden. During the journey they heard that some items belonging to William Harrison had been discovered on the main road between Chipping Campden and Ebrington. These included a hat, a shirt and a neckband. Although the hat had been slashed by a sharp implement, and the shirt and the neckband were covered in blood, there was no sign of the body of William Harrison. Investigation Under questioning John Perry said that he knew Harrison had been murdered, but claimed to be innocent of the crime. He then said that his mother, Joan, and his brother, Richard, had killed Harrison for his money and hidden the body. Joan and Richard denied that they had had anything to do with Harrison's disappearance, but John continued to say that they were guilty, claiming they had dumped his body in a millpond. The pond was dredged, but no body was found. Trials The first court hearings dealt with charges linked to a plot to steal money from William Harrison. Despite his mother and brother pleading \\"not guilty\\", John Perry's testimony convinced the jury based on the following: #John seemed to have no apparent reason to be lying about the matter. #John claimed that he was the one who suggested the robbery to Richard. #John told the court that Joan and Richard had already stolen ¬£140 from William Harrison's house the previous year. (This was a very tidy sum of money in 1660 England, equivalent to ¬£28,361.86 in 2019.Bank of England inflation calculator) #John had lied about being attacked by robbers a few weeks before Harrison's disappearance. The defendants had all changed their pleas to guilty, because as first time offenders they were granted a free pardon under the Indemnity and Oblivion Act of 1660. Stratmann states that this was a bad piece of advice by the lawyers for the defendants. However, at the time, the judge refused to prosecute the three for murder as there was no body. In Spring 1661 the court reconvened to hear the charge of murder and, because of the earlier guilty plea to the robbery, they were now considered to be criminals. This time John Perry joined his mother and brother in pleading not guilty in the killing of William Harrison. The servant claimed that his original testimony had been false by reason of insanity. Nevertheless, the jury found all three of the Perrys guilty and they were sentenced to death. The three Perrys were hanged together on Broadway Hill in Gloucestershire, and Broadway Tower now stands on the very site of their hanging. On the scaffold Richard and John reiterated that they were entirely innocent of killing William Harrison. As their mother was also suspected of being a witch, she was executed first in case she had cast a spell on her son(s) which was preventing them from confessing. Return of William Harrison In 1662 Harrison returned to England aboard a ship from Lisbon. He claimed that he had been abducted, wounded, had his pockets stuffed with money and been spirited away on horses from England via Deal port in Kent, transferred to a Turkish ship and sold into slavery in the Ottoman Empire. Harrison said that after about a year and three quarters his master had died and that he then went to a port and stowed away on a Portuguese ship, finally returning to Dover by way of Lisbon. The case led to the popular belief that England had a criminal law of 'no body, no murder'. Morton states that this is a misconception and that no such law existed,. Linda Stratmann, in her book Gloucestershire Murders, states that Harrison's story makes no sense. Who would abduct a 70-year-old man, stuff his pockets with money and sell him into slavery for a few pounds? Why did nobody notice him being taken on horseback from Chipping Campden to Deal? She also points out that his claims that his attackers wounded him in the thigh and side with a sword, then nursed him back to health, make no sense either. Later accounts John Masefield wrote two plays on the subject: The Campden Wonder and Mrs Harrison. The latter dealt with the popular myth that Harrison's wife committed suicide on learning that her husband was alive. The case is mentioned, along with the Sandyford murder case, in E.C. Bentley's detective novel Trent's Last Case (1920). It is also mentioned (as the \\"Camden Mystery\\") in John Rhode's detective novel In Face of the Verdict (in the U.S., In the Face of the Verdict) (1936). Another novel by Victoria Bennett called The Poorest He (2005) gives a fictional account of the case. There is also a radio play of the story dating from 1994, Roger Hume's The Campden Wonder. The final track on Inkubus Sukkubus' 2016 album Barrow Wake is a musical telling of the tale.

He served as the fourth Governor of Arizona Territory and was nominated to become Governor of Idaho Territory but declined the position. In his later life he served as President of Washington's constitutional convention and as a Justice of the Washington Supreme Court. Background Hoyt was born on October 6, 1841, to David and Susan (Fancher) Hoyt in Austinburg Township, Ohio. He was educated in public schools and at the Grand River Institute. Upon completing his education, Hoyt worked as a teacher until the outbreak of the American Civil War. On May 27, 1862, Hoyt enlisted as a private in the 87th Ohio Infantry. After one month of service he was made a commissary sergeant and then he and his regiment were captured by Confederate forces at the Battle of Harpers Ferry. Hoyt was mustered out on October 3, 1862 and he reenlisted as a commissary sergeant in the 2nd Ohio Heavy Artillery. Later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Ohio Light Artillery and on January 15, 1866, was mustered out as the rank of captain. After the war he was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic. Hoyt married Lettie J. Lewis of Adams, New York on December 27, 1869. The couple had one daughter, June, and two sons, Harold and Arthur. Early political career Upon his return to civilian life, Hoyt began studying law at a law firm in Jefferson, Ohio, before enrolling at the Ohio State & Union Law School in Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated in July 1867 and moved to Vassar, Michigan. In 1868 and 1870, Hoyt was elected a prosecuting attorney for Tuscola County, Michigan. This was followed by election to the Michigan House of Representatives in 1872 and 1874 where he served as Speaker of the House in 1875. Arizona Territory President Ulysses S. Grant nominated Hoyt to be Secretary of Arizona Territory on May 22, 1876. The new Secretary arrived in the territorial capital of Tucson on July 8, 1876, and was sworn in the same day. While in his new position he continued to practice law, being admitted to the Arizona bar on November 13, 1876, and admitted to practice law in the Territorial Supreme Court on January 3, 1877. His primary accomplishment as Secretary was compiling a new legal code for the 9th Arizona Territorial Legislature This legal code, the \\"Hoyt Code\\", expanded the earlier \\"Howell Code\\" while retaining the same structure of the earlier work. Hoyt was commissioned to replace the retiring Anson P.K. Safford as governor on April 5, 1877. Due to several lawsuits at the time naming Hoyt in his official capacity as Secretary, he asked to defer his assumption of the governor's office until a replacement could take his former position and represent Arizona Territory. The incoming Secretary, John J. Gosper, arrived on May 30, 1877, and Hoyt was sworn in as governor the same day. Hoyt suspended his practice of law due to a decision by Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz that he should not practice while serving as governor. Upon his ascension to the governorship, Hoyt had two major rivalries to deal with. He was able to help heal a bitter relationship between the territory's civilian and military leadership which had developed under Governor Safford, with General Irvin McDowell commending Hoyt on his attitude. He had less success addressing the rivalry between the northern and southern portions of the territory, but was seen as a neutral party unaffiliated with either part of the territory. Hoyt's term saw the opening of the Bisbee and Tombstone mining districts, construction of a dependable civilian telegraph system, and the connection of Yuma to California by the eastward building Southern Pacific Railroad. Despite the citizens of Arizona being generally happy with his performance as governor, Hoyt learned on June 12, 1878, that he had been replaced by John C. Fr√©mont. The outgoing governor initially wished to leave the territory but was convinced to remain on the job until the arrival of his replacement. Idaho Territory Following the appointment of Fr√©mont as Governor of Arizona, Hoyt was offered the governorship of Idaho Territory. He declined the nomination because he felt that Governor Mason Brayman was being improperly replaced. Hoyt was also worried that the manner of his appointment and Senate confirmation would prejudice the citizens of Idaho Territory against him to the point that he could not effectively serve. Hoyt instead wrote to Interior Secretary Shurz requesting a different assignment. When a comparable position did not present itself, Hoyt temporarily left federal service. Washington After leaving office in Arizona, Hoyt traveled to Washington, D. C., and requested an appointment as a territorial chief justice. In January 1879, he was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Washington Territory, a position Hoyt held until 1887. In May 1887, he became manager of the territory's largest bank and in 1889 he was President of Washington's constitutional convention. Following Washington's statehood, Hoyt was elected a justice of the Washington Supreme Court from 1889 until 1897. From 1898 till 1902, he was a regent for the University of Washington and a law professor at the school from 1902 till 1907. Hoyt died in Seattle, Washington, on August 27, 1926, and his ashes were interred in his family plot at Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park.

Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court created a new doctrine of abstention. Facts The Railroad Commission of Texas granted defendant Burford an order which gave him a right to drill four oil wells on a small plot of land on the East Texas Oil Field. Plaintiff Sun Oil Co. sued Burford in United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, asserting both federal question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction, and alleging that the Commission's order denied them Due Process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Commission was charged by Texas state law with the administration of oil and gas regulations, including production quotas for each field and well. Quotas were set in conjunction with other oil- and gas-producing states. Part of its duties was regulating the spacing of the individual oil wells. Because of the complex geology of oil fields and multiple division of surface rights, one user's oil drilling activity can affect the production of others, which meant that both public and private interests were at stake. Underground water and gas pressure needed to be monitored in order to maintain steady oil production and prevent waste. Because the rule governing the spacing of wells over the oil field, known as ‚ÄúRule 37‚Äù, generated a large amount of litigation among many competing landowners and potential drillers, the Texas Legislature had developed a special system of judicial review for such cases. Commission orders could be appealed to the state district court in Travis County, Texas, and could then be reviewed by the Texas Court of Civil Appeals, and then to the Texas Supreme Court, which had final authority over questions of state law. The district court of Travis County was given exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of Commission orders, allowing them to specialize in such matters and promoting cooperation between the court and the Commission. There already existed conflicting statutory interpretations between the state and federal courts in this matter, so the district court chose to abstain in deference to the state and dismiss the case. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Court's dismissal. Plurality opinion Justice Black, writing for the plurality, reversed the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and upheld the District Court's dismissal of the matter. The central issue to the plaintiff's claim was the ‚Äúreasonableness‚Äù of the Commission's order according to state law, which Black agreed was a different standard than constitutional due process. Black compared the situation in this case to that in Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., arguing that this was a matter of interpretation of state law which needed to be handled authoritatively by the state court system, and that state court review was adequate, especially in light of the fact that questions of federal law could still be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court via writ of certiorari from the Texas Supreme Court. Holding Under the doctrine of Burford abstention, a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction may abstain from hearing the case where the state courts likely have greater expertise in a particularly complex and a unique area of state law which is of special significance to the state, where there is comprehensive state administrative/regulatory procedure, and where the federal issues cannot be decided without delving into state law. Concurrence Justice Douglas, concurring, implied that the Court's ruling did not go far enough. He noted that > the opinion of the Court as I read it does not hold or even fairly imply > that 'the enforcement of state rights created by state legislation and > affecting state policies is limited to the state courts.' Any such holding > would result in a drastic inroad on diversity jurisdiction-a limitation > which I agree might be desirable but which Congress, not this Court, should > make. The holding in these cases, however, goes to no such length. 319 U.S. at 335. Here, he is essentially criticizing the reach of the federal courts‚Äô diversity jurisdiction into matters of state law. He pointed out that even though the Court's opinion views the Commission and the Texas court system ‚Äúworking partners‚Äù in administering the law, the courts are in reality sitting in judgment of the Commission's decisions. This is a role which a U.S. District Court would be unwise to play, for it would interfere with the State's administration of its own laws and create serious issues of federalism and create conflicting legal precedent. Dissent Justice Frankfurter dissented, defending the concept of diversity jurisdiction as a method of providing an impartial forum for disputes between parties from different states, and criticizing the majority for denying the parties their day in federal court. He noted that the question of whether to limit or abolish diversity jurisdiction is a question for Congress, and not the courts. He distinguished Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co. on the grounds that in that case, the state law question could have displaced the federal issue entirely, and that the Texas Supreme Court had already defined the terms of the statute and the scope of judicial review thereunder.

Background and lyrics The song is a dialogue between the last man and woman left alive following an apocalyptic catastrophe. Dobson stated that the inspiration for \\"Morning Dew\\" was the film On the Beach, which is about the survivors of virtual global annihilation by nuclear holocaust. Dobson wrote the song while staying with a friend in Los Angeles; she recalled how the guests at her friend's apartment were speculating about a nuclear war's aftermath and \\"after everyone went to bed, I sat up and suddenly I just started writing this song [although] I had never written [a song] in my life\\". In 1961, Dobson premiered \\"Morning Dew\\" at the inaugural Mariposa Folk Festival and a live recording appeared on Dobson's At Folk City album in 1962. In 1969, she recorded a studio version for her self-titled album. Other recordings The earliest release of a studio version of \\"Morning Dew\\" was on the 1964 self-titled album by the Goldebriars, using the title \\"Come Walk Me Out\\" and without giving songwriter credit to Dobson. It was followed about a month later by a recording by singer and guitarist Fred Neil with Vince Martin, for their album Tear Down The Walls. Tim Rose followed with a version for his self-titled debut album; according to Dobson, \\"all Tim Rose did was take Freddie Neil's changes\\". Dobson claimed she never met Rose, but she received 75% songwriting royalty as she retains sole writing credit for the song's music. \\"Morning Dew\\" became part of the Grateful Dead's repertoire after frontman Jerry Garcia was introduced to the Fred Neil recording by roadie Laird Grant in 1966. The group first played the song as their opening number at the Human Be-In in January 1967; the same month the group recorded it for their self-titled debut album, which was released that March.McNally Dennis (2002) A Long Strange Trip: The Inside History of the Grateful Dead (1st ed.); New York City, Broadway Books, p. 539 In February 1968, a recording by Sugar Shack reached number 17 in Ireland..

After seven years in office he did not seek reelection to the PSC in 2016. Holloway previously was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the since defunct Alexandria-based 8th congressional district from 1987 to 1993. Background Holloway was one of seven children born in the small town of Lecompte in southern Rapides Parish to James Cecil Holloway (October 15, 1909 - September 26, 2006), formerly from Arizona, and the former Ever Christina Barker (December 7, 1912 - December 11, 2006). The Holloways later moved to Forest Hill just west of Lecompte and south of Alexandria, the largest city in central Louisiana. James Holloway earned his livelihood as an electrician at Camp Claiborne and was later employed at the Meeker Sugar Cooperative. He retired as a Rapides Parish school bus driver. The senior Holloways were married for seventy-one years; he preceded her in death by some ten weeks. Ever Holloway was the daughter of Charlie and Emma Barker. The senior Holloways are interred at Butters Cemetery in Forest Hill. Clyde Holloway's surviving siblings, Carl, Virginia, Charlie, Vivian, Claude, and Lillian reside in the Forest Hill area. Charlie Holloway is a former member of the Rapides Parish School Board. Clyde Holloway Nursery, shown closed on the day of the former representative's funeral, remains open for business off U.S. Highway 165 in Forest Hill, Louisiana. Clyde Holloway attended the National Aeronautics School in Kansas City, Kansas. He worked as a civilian employee at the United States Army base Fort Polk while establishing his Clyde Holloway Nursery, one of the oldest and largest commercial horticultural operations in Forest Hill, which generated some $1.7 million in annual receipts. The company continues to operate since Holloway's death. Holloway was a former chairman of the board of the private Forest Hill Academy, originally Forest Hill Neighborhood School. Holloway was married to Catherine F. K. \\"Cathie\\" Holloway (born October 1943), a Roman Catholic and a native of Long Island, New York, whom he met while working in New York City as an airline ticket agent. The couple has two sons, Timothy Andrew Holloway (born December 1969) of Rapides Parish and Mark R. Holloway (born 1971) of Portland, Oregon; two daughters, Rebecca H. Ebert (born 1975) and husband Randy of Carol Stream, Illinois, and Sara H. Bruner (born 1979) and husband, Bryan, of Fort Worth, Texas, and nine grandchildren. Holloway was a long-term member of the Elwood Baptist Church in Forest Hill.In Memory: Clyde C. Holloway, funeral brochure, Hixson Bros., October 22, 2016 U.S. House of Representatives 1980 election Holloway first ran for Congress in 1980 against Democratic incumbent Gillis William Long. Holloway depicted himself as a Reaganite and a conservative and as an opponent of Republican U.S. District Judge Nauman Scott's cross-parish school busing orders, because the busing would have effectively destroyed the local public school, a nucleus and critical unifying factor in their small rural town of Forest Hill. Holloway summarized his opposition to forced busing by pointing out that \\"parents of both black and white children opposed the forced busing and he saw the fight as essentially being about the \\"right of a small, rural community like Forest Hill to exist.\\" Robert Henry Mitchell (born 1945), also of Forest Hill, the Republican loser to Long in the 1978 race, ran again. Long prevailed with 75,433 votes (68.9 percent) to Holloway's 27,816 (25.4 percent) and Mitchell's 6,243 (5.7 percent). As it turned out, Holloway was laying the groundwork in the 1980 campaign for his eventual three elections to the U.S. House. Holloway and Long were actually both residents of Rapides Parish so many were stunned when Holloway actually defeated the long-time powerful incumbent Long in their home parish. In January 1981, Holloway, along with State Representative Woody Jenkins, an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate on three occasions, spoke at a rally in Alexandria to voice support of two proposed constitutional amendments, which have never come to fruition. One sought to ban forced school busing for purposes of racial integration. Another called for the election of federal judges, rather than appointment by the president and confirmation by the U.S. Senate. At the rally, Holloway said \\"the only way Americans can turn around and go in the right direction is if middle-class people like us will show ... how we feel.\\"\\"Hundreds rally in Alexandria\\", Minden Press-Herald, January 15, 1981, p. 1 1985 special election In 1985, Gillis Long died on the day of Reagan's second inauguration. A special election was held on March 30 to fill out his term, and Holloway entered the race as the lone Republican candidate. Long's widow, Catherine Small Long and Alexandria attorney John W. \\"Jock\\" Scott, a State Representative in his third and final term, also ran. \\"Cathy\\" Long, a native of Dayton, Ohio, was a landslide winner, with 59,836 votes (55.4 percent). Scott finished second with 26,573 (24.6 percent), and Holloway trailed with 17,920 votes (16.6 percent). 1986 election In 1986, in his third attempt to gain a seat in Congress, Holloway was the lone Republican in the nonpartisan blanket primary to succeed Mrs. Long in the majority African-American district.Jet Magazine, September 21, 1992, Vol 82, Number 22, p. 6. His principal opponent was E. Faye Williams, an African-American woman attorney from Alexandria, a graduate of Howard University Law School who supported abortion and expanded federal-state social programs. Toward the end of the campaign, it was disclosed that Williams' estranged husband, Stan Duke, a black television broadcaster in Los Angeles, California, shot to death a white college professor and political activist, Averill Berman, whom Williams had been dating. The news damaged Williams, who had been leading handily in pre-election polls though she explained that she was in this tragedy a crime victim, not a criminal. The other contenders were Morgan Godeau, State Senator Joe Sevario of Prairieville in Ascension Parish, and Carson K. Killen, of St. Amant, also in Ascension Parish. Killen had been an aide to Gillis Long and had been groomed as Long's long-term successor. Williams led Holloway in the primary, 46,025 (26 percent) to 41,618 (23 percent), a margin of 4,407 votes. Goudeau was third with 36,304 ballots (20 percent), followed by Sevario with 34,847 votes (19 percent), and Killen with 21,116 votes (11.8 percent). Polls indicated that Williams would defeat Holloway in the general election in part because the district was 90 percent historically Democratic. High turnout, particularly in the large black community, was expected to benefit Williams until the disclosure that her former husband had shot to death her paramour changed the dynamics of the race. Holloway hence pulled an upset. He received 102,276 votes (51.4 percent) to Williams' 96,864 (48.6 percent). He was heavily dependent on his native Rapides and neighboring Avoyelles parishes. Holloway was estimated to have received 73 percent of the ballots of whites and 1 percent of the black vote. Holloway appeared to play into the racialized politics, giving an interview on the eve of the election that discussed Dr. Williams' violent assault and suggested that Averill Berman may have been a communist. 1988 election In 1988, Williams and Holloway, as the two leaders in the primary, again squared off in the general election. Holloway was helped in his second congressional victory by the presence of the successful Republican presidential nominee, Vice President George H. W. Bush, who won the state by a comfortable margin. This time, Holloway defeated Williams, 116,241 votes (56.8 percent) to 88,564 (43.2 percent). After her defeats, Williams left Alexandria and relocated to Washington, D.C. Other candidates in the 1988 primary were former Alexandria Mayor John K. Snyder, who received only 1,205 votes (less than 1 percent), and former Lieutenant Governor Bobby Freeman, who polled 14,814 votes (11 percent). 1990 election In 1990, Holloway defeated two state senators in the primary, Cleo Fields, an African American from Baton Rouge, and the previously mentioned Joe McPherson, Jr., of Holloway's own Rapides Parish. Holloway polled 113,607 votes (56.4 percent) to 59,511 (29.6 percent) for Fields, and 28,170 (14 percent) for McPherson. 1991 gubernatorial election Holloway's three consecutive House victories, two with more than 55 percent of the vote, made him feel secure in running for governor in 1991; he could run statewide in an off-year from congressional races without surrendering his House seat. He won the endorsement of state Republican delegates against the sitting Republican governor, Buddy Roemer, who had been elected as a Democrat in 1987 in the primary. In the 1991 primary, Holloway finished fourth, with 82,683 (5.3 percent) but did place ahead of Roemer in Evangeline and St. Landry parishes. One reason that Holloway supporters rejected Roemer was the outgoing governor's support for abortion. Previously considered pro-life, Roemer reversed himself and vetoed three bills which would have restricted access to abortion in Louisiana. Instead, the 1991 gubernatorial general election featured unendorsed Republican David Duke and former Governor Edwin Edwards. Holloway refused to endorse either Duke or Edwards, who won a landslide victory for a fourth nonconsecutive term in part because the third-place candidate, Roemer, endorsed Edwards in the showdown with Duke, who was unpopular with moderate voters because of his Ku Klux Klan ties. 1992 election After his gubernatorial loss, Holloway mapped plans in 1992 to seek re-election to Congress. Louisiana lost a congressional district as a result of the 1990 census, and Holloway's Alexandria-based Eighth District was eliminated. His home in Forest Hill was drawn into a revised Sixth District stretching from Baton Rouge on the south to Alexandria on the north. He faced two opponents, fellow Republican Representative Richard Baker and the Democratic mayor of Alexandria, Edward Gordon \\"Ned\\" Randolph, Jr., who coincidentally died in 2016 twelve days before the passing of Holloway. In the nonpartisan blanket primary, Holloway led with 52,012 votes (37 percent) to Baker's 46,990 (33 percent), and Randolph's 42,819 (30 percent). In the general election held on the day of the presidential election in which Bill Clinton unseated George H. W. Bush, Holloway won fifteen of seventeen parishes in the Sixth District. However, Baker polled clear majorities in the two largest parishes of Livingston and his home base, East Baton Rouge. That was enough for Baker to win the seat, 123,953 votes (50.6 percent) to Holloway's 121,225 (49.5 percent). Had Holloway been able to hold down Baker's margin in East Baton Rouge, he would have secured a fourth House term. Tenure In the U.S. House, Holloway was considered a \\"protectionist\\" and an opponent of \\"free trade\\" policies, which he believed contributed to economic troubles in Louisiana. Unlike Long, however, he was an ardent fiscal and social conservative. He voted to cut government spending. He was skeptical of international organizations that he felt undermined American sovereignty. His voting record consistently reflected his middle class beliefs. He advocated rolling back \\"big government\\" by cutting taxes and also wanted to restore school prayer and end abortion. Unsuccessful election campaigns 1994 congressional election Holloway waged further determined campaigns to return to Congress. In the heavily Republican year of 1994, he moved to the Lafayette-based Louisiana's 7th congressional district in southwestern Louisiana to oppose Democratic Representative Jimmy Hayes. Hayes polled 72,424 votes (53 percent) to Holloway's 54,253 (39.7 percent). Another 7.3 percent of voters supported a candidate who ran as \\"No party.\\" 1996 congressional election In 1996, Holloway entered the race for the revised (again) Fifth District, which covers the northeast quadrant of Louisiana, stretching to south of Alexandria to include his Forest Hill residence. Holloway ran third in the primary to fellow Republican John Cooksey, a Monroe ophthalmologist, and Democratic State Representative and later State Senator Francis C. Thompson, a popular large landowner in Delhi in Richland Parish. Cooksey polled 60,853 ballots (34 percent) to Holloway's 48,226 (27 percent). Thompson, with 50,144 votes (28 percent), hence went into the 1996 general election with Cooksey. Two other Republican candidates, Ben Marshall and Tim Robinson, polled more than 12,000 critical primary votes, some potentially at Holloway's expense. Holloway's weak showing in Ouachita Parish, fewer than five thousand votes, kept him from proceeding to the second round of balloting, just as his weak showing in East Baton Rouge Parish had doomed him in 1992. Thwarted once more, Holloway endorsed Cooksey, with whom he shared a similar conservative philosophy, and helped him to raise money. Cooksey in turn won the seat handily, 135,990 (58.3 percent) to the more liberal Thompson's 97,363 (41.7 percent). 2002 congressional election When Cooksey decided to run for the U.S. Senate against Democrat Mary Landrieu in 2002, Holloway entered the race to succeed him in the House. For a time, Holloway appeared strong. He had the support of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert of Illinois, and the Majority Whip, Tom DeLay of Texas. But he finished third in the nonpartisan blanket primary with 42,573 votes (23 percent). Leading the pack was the eventual winner, Democrat Rodney Alexander, with 52,952 votes (29 percent). Newcomer Dewey Lee Fletcher, a Republican advertising entrepreneur from Monroe, who had previously been an aide to Cooksey, finished second in the primary with 45,278 (25 percent). A switch of 2,705 votes from Fletcher to Holloway would have placed Holloway in the second round of balloting against Alexander. A fourth candidate, Republican State Senator Robert J. Barham of Oak Ridge in Morehouse Parish, had 34,533 votes (19 percent). Three other candidates shared the remaining but critical 9,000 votes (5 percent). Alexander then defeated Fletcher in the general election by only 974 votes, 86,718 (50.3 percent) to 85,744 (49.7 percent). 2003 Lieutenant governor's race In 2003, Holloway ran for Lieutenant Governor but was defeated by the Democrat Mitch Landrieu, younger brother of Senator Mary Landrieu. He originally ran on an intraparty ticket with the then-chairman of the PSC, Jay Blossman, of St. Tammany Parish. When Blossman withdrew from the gubernatorial race in light of weak poll numbers, Holloway remained a candidate for Lieutenant Governor. He polled 249,668 votes (19 percent) to Landrieu's 674,803 (53 percent). The other 28 percent was shared by several other candidates, including the late African- American businessman Kirt Bennett of Baton Rouge and Melinda Schwegmann, the Democratic lieutenant governor from 1992 to 1996, who while serving as a state representative from Orleans Parish switched in 2003 to the Republican Party. Announcing his candidacy only one month prior to the election and spending less than $10,000, Holloway still scored majorities in La Salle, Caldwell, and West Carroll parishes, re all sparsely populated areas in north Louisiana. He scored pluralities in Avoyelles and Evangeline parishes, both from his defunct Eighth Congressional District. Rural development director On October 19, 2006, Holloway was named Louisiana state director for the Office of Rural Development in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In making the appointment, Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns, currently a U.S. Senator from Nebraska, said that Holloway, who had been a member of the House Agriculture Committee during his six years in Congress, \\"brings a wealth of knowledge to USDA.\\" The agency seeks to increase economic opportunity and to improve the quality of life in rural communities. The agency has invested some $72 billion since 2001 to provide equity and technical assistance to finance and foster growth in homeownership, business development, and critical community and technology infrastructure. The agency claims to have created or saved some 1.2 million jobs nationwide. The Holloway appointment expired on January 20, 2009, with the incoming Barack Obama administration.\\"Holloway appointed to head rural development efforts in Louisiana,\\" Colfax Chronicle (Grant Parish, Louisiana), October 19, 2006 Election to the Public Service Commission Holloway's Public Service Commission office sign in Forest Hill (2009-2016) In 2009, Holloway emerged the plurality leader in a special election for the Public Service Commission post vacated by the resignation of Dale Sittig of Eunice. The other candidate in the runoff, which had been scheduled for May 2, Democratic State Senator Joe McPherson, of Woodworth, formerly from Pineville, no longer a legislator, dropped out on April 13. Holloway narrowly led a three-candidate field in the special election held on April 4. McPherson had lost the previous regular PSC election to Sittig. Democrat-turned-Republican Gil Pinac, a hospital administrator and a former state representative from Crowley in Acadia Parish, finished a weak third in the April 4 balloting. McPherson explained his concession as an anticipation that most of Pinac's supporters would switch to Holloway and give the Republican an insurmountable lead. Holloway polled 32,258 votes (43.5 percent) to McPherson's 31,610 (42.63 percent). Pinac trailed with the critical 10,280 ballots (13.86 percent). McPherson's greatest strength was in populous Calcasieu Parish, where he led with 11,178 (50.4 percent) to Holloway's 7,873 (35.5 percent), and Pinac's 3,127 (14.1 percent). Ironically, Holloway's tabulation in Calcasieu - centered on Lake Charles - was also his single greatest parish total. Rapides Parish, the home of both candidates, voted in a low turnout: 6,527 for Holloway to 5,327 for McPherson, and 791 for Pinac.State of Louisiana, Secretary of State, Special election returns for the Louisiana Public Service Commission, April 4, 2009 As results were still being tabulated, Pinac conceded and endorsed Holloway. Republican Governor Jindal had raised funds for the Democrat McPherson, but had otherwise been silent on the PSC race.The Moon Griffon Show, radio broadcast, April 1, 2009 Numerous people described McPherson, a businessman, as \\"anti-business\\", and the state Republican Party endorsed Holloway. Thus the runoff would have pitted the Republican committee's pick, Holloway, against the beneficiary of Republican Governor Bobby Jindal's fundraising largesse, McPherson. By withdrawing, McPherson removed a political embarrassment for Jindal.The Moon Griffon Show, April 7, 2009. Meanwhile, the Jindal-endorsed Lee Domingue lost the special election for a Louisiana State Senate seat on April 4 to another Republican, Dan Claitor, scion of the Claitor's Publishing Company of Baton Rouge.Jindal- backed candidate loses state Senate race, Lafayette Advertiser, April 7, 2009 In replacing Democrat Sittig, Holloway's addition to the PSC (even including the forerunner Louisiana Railroad Commission) gave the body its first-ever Republican majority. Commissioners Scott Angelle and Eric Skrmetta are, like Holloway, Republican; and the PSC has just five seats. The Democratic PSC members are Foster Campbell of Bossier City (an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate against Jindal in 2007) and Lambert C. Boissiere, III. The PSC is also the first electoral body in Louisiana to develop a Republican majority since Reconstruction.A majority of the U.S. House delegation from Louisiana has been Republican since the 1990s. Democrats hold only one of the six House seats from Louisiana. Both houses of the Louisiana State Legislature gained their first Republican majorities in 2011. Holloway was unopposed for a full term on the PSC in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on August 28, 2010. On July 13, 2010, Holloway noted as a guest on The Moon Griffon Show, based in Monroe, that the August 28 contest was his first ever unopposed race and his thirteenth time to appear on a ballot.The Moon Griffon Show, July 13, 2010 2013 congressional election Holloway surprised political observers on August 21, 2013, when he filed to run in Louisiana's 5th congressional district special election held on October 19, to choose a successor to Republican Rodney Alexander, who resigned from Congress on September 26 to fill a temporary position in the Jindal administration. Holloway said that his candidacy for the seat was motivated by suspicions that Alexander and Jindal were attempting to engineer the election of Republican State Senator Neil Riser of Columbia to succeed Alexander, who became the director of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs. Holloway said: \\"This thing stinks ... I feel like we tried to have an appointed congressman by the governor and by Rodney... Without any doubt, I think they've been orchestrating this for months.\\" Early in the campaign, Holloway endorsed President Barack Obama's call for American military intervention in Syria, a position in sharp contrast to that of several opponents, including fellow Republican rivals Riser and Jay Morris, a state representative from Monroe, who finished the race in a weak sixth place. With 11,250 votes (11 percent), Holloway finished in fourth place in the special congressional election. He polled a plurality only in St. Landry Parish and finished second in his own Rapides Parish, where Riser led the balloting. The top two candidates overall, Riser (32 percent) and the Monroe-area businessman and political newcomer Vance McAllister (18 percent), met in the runoff election on November 16. Holloway endorsed McAllister, who won the runoff. 2014 congressional race Holloway last campaign sign (2014) in his native Lecompte, Louisiana In filing once again for Congress, Holloway said that he considers himself the only candidate who can defeat McAllister, whose reputation was damaged by a scandal earlier this year when a video was published showing the married congressman kissing a former female staffer and the wife of a friend of McAllister's. He said: \\"I was disappointed in McAllister and still am. He had a golden opportunity and blew it. We need someone who can serve the district with integrity, and I believe I'm the best one for the job.\\" In the November 4 election, Holloway received 7.46 percent of the vote. The district was ultimately settled in a runoff election between Republican Ralph Abraham and Democrat Jamie Mayo. In the runoff, Abraham won with 64.2 percent of the vote. PSC tenure Holloway was elected to the Louisiana Public Service Commission on April 4, 2009 and assumed the role on April 27, 2009. His current term ends on December 31, 2016. He indicated that he will seek another full term in the 2016 election. He is expected to receive a tough challenge from a Democratic candidate. On January 22, 2015, Holloway was named by his colleagues as the chairman of the PSC for the following two years. Holloway said he will work in the next two years to make \\"certain that infrastructure needed for industry growth is in place without an adverse effect on ratepayers.\\" He noted that Louisiana has the lowest electrical utility residential rates in the nation, and \\"I want to work to make certain we maintain that advantage.\\" On March 28, 2016, Holloway was the only dissenting public service commissioner to oppose the sale of Cleco, an energy company based in Pineville, to a group of foreign investors: Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, John Hancock Financial, and other infrastructure investors. In his opposition, Holloway expressed fear for \\"the long term consequences of Cleco's captive ratepayers. Cleco as we know it has ceased to exist. It is now owned by a private foreign investment company that plans to flip it in eight to ten years. And that same private foreign investment company is financing the deal with a massive amount of debt and ratepayers' tax money. ...I am proud of my 'No' vote and will continue to work hard for those folks who can't walk away.\\" Death and aftermath Pallbearers carry the coffin of former U.S. Representative Clyde Holloway from the Forest Hill festival grounds to the hearse bound for Butters Cemetery. Holloway died on October 16, 2016, of complications from pneumonia at his home in Forest Hill, Louisiana.Former Louisiana Congressman Clyde Holloway dies at 72Well-known Louisiana congressman, Public Service Commission chair Clyde Holloway dies Sunday Services were held at 11 a.m. on October 22, 2016, at the Forest Hill festival grounds in the center of town. Eulogies were delivered by the Reverend James Cooper, a retired pastor and longtime Holloway family minister; younger son Mark Holloway, Richard \\"Dick\\" Fiorenza, a friend and colleague at National Airlines; Marcia Young, a fellow nursery owner in Forest Hill who worked with Holloway in the formation of the former Forest Hill Academy; John Sharp, a long-time friend; Stephen LeBlanc, former congressional press secretary; Royal Alexander, former Holloway congressional staff member and unsuccessful candidate in 2007 for Attorney General of Louisiana, and Karen Haymon, Holloway's PSC chief of staff. Helen Mills, Holloway's high school classmate and the pianist at Elwood Baptist Church, played for the funeral. Tamara Brooks, a family friend, sang \\"Because He Lives\\", and Clyde Lea James, a Holloway cousin, sang \\"It Is Well with My Soul\\". The congregation joined in singing \\"America the Beautiful\\", led by the Reverend Michael Evans, pastor of Elwood Baptist Church. A private burial at Butters Cemetery followed with a public reception at the Forest Hill Town Hall. Holloway's colleagues on the Public Service Commission, including former commissioner Jimmy Field, were his honorary pallbearers. Holloway died three weeks before the November 8 general election in which his PSC successor was chosen. The easy winner in that race was former Louisiana Republican Party state chairman Mike Francis of Crowley, who defeated another Republican, Reldon R. Owens of Alexandria, and a Democrat, Mary Leach Werner, daughter of the former U.S. Representative Buddy Leach of Louisiana's 4th congressional district, for the right to succeed Holloway. Meanwhile, the day before Holloway's funeral, Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, named former Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives Charles W. DeWitt Jr. of Rapides Parish to finish the two months left in Holloway's term.

Byron served as the President of the University of Scranton from 1975 to 1982 and the President of Catholic University of America from 1982 to 1992. He is now a Professor of Business and Society at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. Early life and education Byron was born in 1927 in Pittsburgh and raised in Philadelphia. He attended St. Joseph's Preparatory School, graduating in 1945. Upon his graduation, Byron served in the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the United States Army in the Second World War from 1945 to 1946. Before entering the Society of Jesus in 1950, he was a student at St. Joseph‚Äôs University for three years. He was ordained in 1961. Father Byron received a doctorate in economics from the University of Maryland. He also holds two theology degrees from Woodstock College, a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a master's degree in economics from Saint Louis University. Over the course of his career, Father Bryon has received more than twenty-five honorary degrees, including an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from the University of Scranton in 1982. Career Early career Father Byron served as a mathematics professor at Scranton Preparatory School from 1956 to 1958. In 1962 he was named assistant editor of America and from 1965 to 1966 he held a teaching fellowship and a U.S. Department of Labor Manpower Research Fellowship at the University of Maryland. From 1967 to 1969 he served as assistant professor of economics at Loyola University Maryland and served as adjunct professor of pastoral theology at Woodstock College, the most important center of Catholic teaching in the Country. He was named associate professor of social ethics and director of field education at Woodstock College. When Woodstock moved from Maryland to New York City, he became rector of the Woodstock Jesuit Community. He also served as a lecturer at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. President of the University of Scranton In 1975, Father Byron became the President at the University of Scranton, succeeding Dexter L. Hanley, S.J. He served as President until he resigned in 1982. Father Panuska, the former academic vice president and dean of faculties at Boston College, succeeded Byron as Scranton‚Äôs next president. Under Byron‚Äôs leadership, the University of Scranton underwent significant changes, including gains in enrollment, increasing academic standing of the University, improvements, construction, and expansion on the campus, the addition of a number of academic majors and programs. During Father Byron‚Äôs tenure as President, total enrollment grew from 3,954 in the 1974-1975 academic year to 4,196 by the time of his departure in 1980-1981. The applicant pool, the total students applying for admission to the institution, was enlarged under Father Byron. Additionally, the acceptance ratio, the percentage of individuals accepted for admission to the University from the total percentage of applicants, fell from seventy- three percent to sixty percent. As Scranton became more selective during the admission process, it indicated the rising academic quality of the University. Byron also doubled the operating budget while also maintaining a positive balance in that budget each year and enhanced the administrative efficiency and ability to properly plan by introducing a computer-based Management Information System. While president, Father Byron led the university through a successful three million capital fundraising campaign and then through a five- year, six million capital development program, which doubled the University‚Äôs endowment. One of the components of the development program, called ‚ÄúCommitments to Excellence,‚Äù was targeted at improving the physical plant of the campus as well as the greater Scranton/Wilkes-Barre community. In addition to Father Byron‚Äôs work to receive approval to build the Linden Street Commons, Byron accomplished this project by organizing a number of other projects aimed at improving and expanding the physical campus, which included the purchase of a number of buildings, including Jefferson Hall to serve as an additional residence hall and center for student activities and ‚ÄúThe Gallery‚Äù to house classrooms, offices, and study spaces. The University also created the Galvin Terrace, an athletic and recreational outdoor complex which contained six tennis courts, two combination basketball and volleyball courts, and recreational areas. Additionally, there were renovations on many of the residence halls. The development program also included plans to establish the School of Management and to extend the Office of Continuing Education to meet the needs of those in the greater community who want to continue their post- secondary education by offering a range of associate degrees and opportunities for local employers and employees to train at the corporate site or at the University. In addition to accomplishing these goals to expand the University‚Äôs colleges, new academic programs were created under Father Byron, including international studies, nursing, physical therapy, law enforcement, public administration, family studies, and Byzantine studies. In 1981, Father Byron announced his plans to leave the University of Scranton in June 1982, giving the Board of Trustees ample time to find a suitable replacement. The Board of Trustees picked Father Joseph Allen Panuska, S.J., to succeed him. As Judge Conaboy wrote in a letter after he heard of Byron‚Äôs announcement to resign as President of the University of Scranton, Byron‚Äôs accomplishments and improvements at the school combine with the establishment of the Scranton Journal, setting new records in medical school acceptances and Fulbright Scholarships, winning a national basketball championship in men‚Äôs competition, and producing national title contenders in soccer and women‚Äôs basketball, ‚Äúto make a review of Byron‚Äôs tenure at the University of Scranton an enormous success and a great contribution to this entire community.‚Äù The University Commons The Commons For twenty five years, there had been an effort by the University of Scranton to close the 900 and 1000 blocks of Linden Street which ran through the school‚Äôs campus. Through Father Byron‚Äôs tremendous effort, the improvement project was actualized in 1980. The Commons project proposed by Father Byron was intended to create a more attractive, park-like atmosphere on the campus and to eliminate the safety hazards associated with pedestrian and vehicle traffic. With that new space, the University hoped to create a twenty- foot wide brick walkway, trees, benches, a water fountain, and patio area in addition to developing the area with landscaping. His plan was met with resistance and objections from some members of the Scranton community. Some, including the Hill Neighborhood Association, expressed concerns about Linden Street‚Äôs closing negatively affecting traffic flow, failing to provide significant access to emergency vehicles, and decreasing the availability of parking in the Hill section of the city. Others, however, supported the University‚Äôs Commons plan, including notable organizations and individuals such as the Scranton Times, the Scranton Fire Chief Robert Ruddy, Scranton City Councilman James Doherty, the board of directors of the Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce, the Lackawanna County Regional Planning Commission, and ABC local television affiliate WNEP TV-16. The University Commons proposal was approved by the Scranton City Council on December 20, 1978. In order to accommodate the concerns of some members of the Scranton community, the University replaced the 84 legal parking spaces closed on Linden Street with over 100 legal parking spaces. The University also reduced the size of the traffic triangle at Linden Street and Monroe Avenue by one-third, creating a smooth traffic flow on Monroe to accommodate Linden Street‚Äôs closing and widened the turning radius on Monroe. The University also pledged 40,000 dollars towards the construction of traffic lights to manage traffic flow. Construction on the project was begun on June 2, 1980, as parts of Linden Street were removed. The project was completed around November 1980 and dedication ceremonies were held in December 1980. The School of Management Before the inception of the School of Management, business and economic programs had been offered in the other three colleges at the University, the College of Arts and Sciences, the Hanley College, and the Graduate School. However, under Byron‚Äôs leadership, the School of Management became a separate academic school in 1978. By establishing the School of Management, the University offered a consolidated business program, benefiting both the students and Northeastern Pennsylvania by providing students with the tools and education needed to cultivate administrative talent needed in local businesses, government, non-profit organizations, hospitals, and schools. The School also sponsored a number of seminars and workshops to discuss and resolve economic problems and difficulties in the local business community, such as through the Executive-in-Residence program, where a businessman would come to the University to discuss their business practices. The School of Management was later renamed the Arthur J. Kania School of Management, or KSOM, in order to recognize the achievements of Mr. Kania as a leader in the business world and a dedicated alumnus of the University. The School was accredited by the AACSB, the International Association for Management Education, in 1996, becoming one of only 13 colleges in the state and 325 in the nation to receive this accreditation. KSOM has continued to expand its programs and majors throughout the years, currently offering programs in accounting, economics, finance, international business, business administration, management, marketing, and operations management in addition to many individualized and specialized majors. President of The Catholic University of America Although he originally planned to spend the academic year of 1982-1983 on sabbatical working on his books, Father Byron accepted the position of President of The Catholic University of America, where he worked from 1982 until 1992. He was the twelfth president of CUA, installed on Thursday, November 18, 1982. He was the first Jesuit to serve as the President of CUA, which, according to Byron, ‚Äúsignifie[d] cooperation between Jesuits and the Catholic hierarchy‚Äù and represented ‚Äúa warm handshake‚Äù between the members of the Society of Jesus and the Catholic Church administration. Later Career, 1992-  Father Byron taught \\"Social Responsibilities of Business\\" in the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University from 1992 until 2000. He also held an appointment as Distinguished Professor of the Practice of Ethics and served as rector of the Georgetown Jesuit Community. From 2000 to 2003, he was pastor of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Washington, D.C. He served as the interim president of Loyola University New Orleans from 2003 to 2004. Father Byron worked as President of St. Joseph‚Äôs Preparatory School from 2006 until 2008. Currently, he works as a Professor of Business and Society at St. Joseph‚Äôs University. Other achievements and notable events On August 27, 1986, the University of Scranton dedicated their new William J. Byron Recreational Complex, which was built to serve the students, particularly the intramural program. Rev. J. A. Panuska, S.J., president of the University of Scranton from 1982 until 1998, stated that naming this facility for Fr. Byron \\"provides us with a marvelous opportunity to thank him for his leadership at the University and in the region.\\" Father Byron has served as a trustee of Loyola College in Maryland and the University of San Francisco and was a founding director and past chairman of Bread for the World, a Christian lobby group arguing for the alleviation of the food crisis throughout the world. Father Byron has served on a number of additional committees throughout his career, including as director of Georgetown University, the Economic Development Council of Northeastern Pennsylvania, the United Way of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Blue Shield, the Northeastern Bank of Pennsylvania, and Scranton‚Äôs Community Medical Center. He was also involved in the policy committee of the National Institute of Independent Colleges and Universities. Finally, he served as an editorial consultant for the Paulish Press, Educational Record and Theological Studies. In 1999, he was the recipient of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities' Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for his contributions over the years to the advancement of Catholic higher education. In the same year, Father Byron received the Council of Independent Colleges‚Äô Academic Leadership Award. Father Byron writes a syndicated bi-weekly column, called \\"Looking Around,\\" for Catholic News Service. Additionally, he has written many books over his career. He also was a guest on HBO's Da Ali G Show.

Borland studied Environmental Art at the Glasgow School of Art and later was awarded an MA from the University of Ulster in 1988. She was on the committee of Transmission Gallery, Glasgow from 1989 to 1991. In 2004, she became one of five artist awarded the prestigious Glenfiddich Artist in Residence programme. In 2012 she was appointed BALTIC Northumbria University Professor - where she heads the Institute of Contemporary Art in Newcastle. This is a collaborative venture between Northumbria University and the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art. Borland is leading member of artists who contributed to the transformation of Glasgow in 1990s as an internationally recognised hub of contemporary arts. Across an international career of 25 years, Borland is recognised for cross-disciplinary projects with other fields, such as medical science and forensics, to explore ideas related to history of medicine, medical ethics and human genetics. She has said, \\"The heart of what I am trying to discuss is very dark, very strong and passionate, and if you can reach that through quite a rational process, I think it becomes more powerful, and importantly, more powerful to the viewer.\\"The Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, Texas: press release 2002 Retrieved 24 March 2006  Practice  Christine Borland's works sculpture, printmaking and photography and with a variety of materials including glass, china, fabric and bronze. She often asks us to consider the fragility of human life and the way in which it is valued by social systems and institutions. Borland's practice highlights the depersonalisation of an individual's identity in Modern medical practices, and her work attempts to regain physicality and identity. Borland questions how we identify scientific fact, objectivity and truth together with traditional, conventional forms of art material, such as bronze or ceramics, together with new technologies. Borland's work, From Life, was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1997 She started with the skeleton of a missing person that she purchased legally from a medical supplies company and received it in the post, and then worked with medicine, forensics, judicial and police institutions to obtain information about the person. The end product was an exhibition of the skeleton, a bronze cast of the head using facial reconstruction. It was an attempt to reclaim the individual identity of the skeleton, and to turn an objective object into an understood, specific human. In November 1996, at the Sean Kelly Gallery, she presented the work \\"Second Class Male, Second Class Female\\" (a second-class man, a second-class woman), in which she reconstructed the heads of two people. LHomme Double was first exhibited in 1997. Borland asked 6 different academically-trained artists to make a clay portraitbust of the notorious Nazi War criminal, Josef Mengele, otherwise known as the Angel of Death. Borland obtained two grainy black-and-white portrait photographs and a short description of Mengele's physical appearance from Auschwitz survivors.Christine Borland at the Lisson by Melissa E. Feldman Retrieved 24 March 2006 This same information was provided to the 6 artists and was used to create portraitbusts. The portrait busts are all different, each presented on a simple Wooden frame as if straight from the artist's studio. Each is made of clay and left unfired, emphasising the overall lack of certainty and finality. When seen together, the six portraits do not provide a clear, recognisable, singular identity, but a number of possibilities. The Dead Teach the Living (1997), originally displayed at the 1997 Munster Sculpture Project in Germany, was a group of computer-reconstructed heads cast in white plaster that show different racial stereotypes. After a True Story‚ÄîGiant and Fairy Tales (1997) showed a negative impression of the skeletal remains of an 18th-century dwarf and contrasted them with a 19th-century giant.

History The Eel River Brewing Company was established in 1994 in Fortuna on the site of the Eel River Brewing Taproom and Grill; both are owned and operated by Margaret Frigon and Ted Vivatson. The brewpub was built on the historic site of the Clay Brown Redwood Mill. The focal point of the pub is the long bar made entirely from recovered historic Redwood and Douglas Fir. The establishment, with its 100+ seating, also offers the largest beer garden on California's North Coast complete with a horseshoe pit. Eel River Brewing made all its beer from 1994 at the brewpub until the move to Scotia in 2007. Since then only small batches of beer are produced at Eel River Brewing Fortuna although it continues to be a top dining destination in the county,Eel River Brewing Company Humboldt County Convention & Visitors Bureau, 2012, accessdate 15 January 2013 with all of Eel River Brewing's beers on tap as well as specialty brews that can be found only there. The menu boasts a wide range of food from stout-smoked BBQ to salads, sandwiches to seafood featuring local and organic Humboldt County products. In 1999, they became one of the first certified organic brewery in the United States; their Amber Ale was the first beer made with that certification. In 2007, Eel River Brewing outgrew the original brewing facility and moved to an old redwood mill in Scotia. In 2009 after only two years at the new brewing facility, Eel River Brewing nearly doubled what they were producing previously at the old site. With production in 2009 of over 7,000 barrels, Eel River Brewing currently distributes to more than half of the states in the U.S. as well as Canada, Mexico and Brazil.  Sustainability  Besides being the first certified- organic brewery in the U.S., the brewing facility is powered by 100% bio-mass renewable energy and has its own wastewater pretreatment facility on location which filters the waste, easing the strain that would otherwise be put on the municipal water treatment plant. Spent grain from the brewing process is used to feed Eel River Brewing‚Äôs local, organic cattle that are in turn sold as organic beef at the Eel River Brewing Company Taproom and Grill in Fortuna. Packaging and promotional items are made from recycled materials and Eel River Brewing buys these items locally to minimize the effects of transportation. The Eel River Brewing tap handles are made from reclaimed wood and all paper packaging is made with recycled materials and printed with soy-based inks.

It is a member of the species aggregate known as Argentina anserina or Potentilla anserina. The yellow, saucer-shaped flowers appear late spring through summer. Pacific silverweed spreads very quickly in moist areas. Preferring salt marshes, river estuaries and shorelines, they are often seen growing alongside springbank clover. They need sun and regular water. Pacific silverweed is important in Pacific Northwest coastal indigenous cultures. Indigenous people dig for its edible roots. As an important vegetable, families maintained rights to access patches through potlatch law. New plants can grow from small root fragments, and with some attention families could guarantee patches persisted for generations \\"over hundreds, even thousands of years\\". Northwest Coast peoples used to dig them in spring with yew-wood shovels before pit-cooking them or boiling them with eulachon grease. Cooked roots have a slightly bitter sweet- potato flavour. Northwest Coast peoples also washed them or mashed them into cakes and dried them for winter.

Like other regions in southern Italy, Calabria for many centuries was an integral part of the kingdom of Naples, and, as with other regions, the musical life tended to be overshadowed by the important activities in the capital city to the north‚Äîthe conservatories there, the composers, the vast amount of music performed in churches (see also Music of Naples). Yet, modern Calabria has developed a vibrant musical life based on its history and, as well, a dedication to building new musical and theatrical facilities, many of which are of the type termed polivalenti in Italian‚Äîthat is, multi-purpose. Folk music The zampogna, a folk bagpipe. The rural Calabrian folk tradition is most closely associated with the zampogna, the Italian bagpipe, which is found across Italy but is an especially important part of the Calabrian tradition. Calabria is home to at least five different kinds of zampogna. This tradition has lately been recorded and adapted by the group Re Niliu. There is also an ancient Lira (violin) tradition, pipita and tambourine.  Songs  The most famous love songs are: *CalabrisellaGatto 2007, p. 42 *CiopareddaGatto 2007, p. 143‚Äì145 *RiturnellaGatto 2007, p. 125‚Äì130 *La NicastrisaGatto 2007, p. 131‚Äì132 and the most famous songs for tarantella: *Volia mi marituGatto 2007, p. 185‚Äì186 *Lu tirannu mbelenatuGatto 2007, p. 187‚Äì189 *Damme lu coreGatto 2007, p. 202 *Chi jati sonanduGatto 2007, p. 208 Musical and theatrical facilities Catanzaro's Teatro Politeama is a new version (2002) of an older theater. It is run by the Catanzaro Foundation for the Politeama Theater and is solidly dedicated to continuing a great operatic tradition. They have already staged Franco Zeffirelli's version of Aida as well as productions of Rigoletto. There is a secondary theater, the Teatro Masciari, once famous as a vaudeville house; after the inevitable post-war decline it has known a modern rebirth as a multi-purpose facility. The Teatro Rendano, in Cosenza, is the only truly traditional theater in Calabria. It was built in 1909, severely damaged by the aerial bombardments of World War II, closed, rebuilt and finally reopened. It has a reputation for fine acoustics and being a beautiful venue for performers and audiences alike. Two associations are connected with the very active performance schedule: the Associazione Quintieri and Associazone Jonica. The city is the site of the Stanislao Giocamantonio music conservatory, housed on the premises of the old Santa Maria delle Grazie convent. Particularly given to emphasizing its Greek history (it was the site of the ancient academy of Pythagoras), Crotone takes advantage of some impressive archaeology as venues for music. Best-known is the Aurora Festival on the grounds of the Temple of Hera Lacinia, which featured a festival dedicated to the music of Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis. The Cilea Theater in Reggio di Calabria. The Teatro Comunale Cilea of Reggio di Calabria was built in 1818 and was originally one of the great royal opera houses in the Kingdom of Naples. It was severely damaged by the 1908 Messina earthquake and again by bombing in World War II. It has since been rebuilt and reopened and pursues an active operatic schedule. The city is also the site of the Francesco Cilea music conservatory, named for the \\"favorite son\\" composer. The Fausto Torrefranca music conservatory is located in Vibo Valentia. The Solisti Calabri is an active chamber music ensemble, and the Cilea Association sponsors regular concerts.

In addition to Against Me!, Grace fronts the band Laura Jane Grace & The Devouring Mothers, a solo project she started in 2016. Grace is notable for being one of the first highly visible punk rock musicians to come out as transgender, after she publicly came out in May 2012.  Early life  Grace was born Thomas James Gabel in Fort Benning, Georgia, the eldest child of United States Army Major Thomas Gabel and Bonnie Gabel (n√©e Grace). Grace has a brother named Mark, who is six years younger. The family moved frequently between military bases due to their father's military career, living briefly in Fort Hood, Texas; Pennsylvania; Ohio; Germany; and at a NATO post in Naples, Italy during the Gulf War. When she was 8 years old while living in Italy, Grace bought her first guitar from Sears mail order with money saved from mowing lawns. Grace initially took guitar lessons from an army officer's wife, but ended up teaching herself how to play. When she was 12 years old, Grace's parents had an acrimonious divorce, which led to Grace and her brother moving with their mom from Naples, Italy ‚Äì where their father remained ‚Äì to Naples, Florida to live with their maternal grandmother. In contrast to her time in Italy, Grace has said that moving to Florida was a difficult adjustment. Constantly bullied at school, Grace was drinking alcohol and taking drugs by age 13, substances which included pot, LSD, and cocaine. Grace was arrested for possession of marijuana at 14 and went on to struggle with addiction for years. Grace also regularly skipped school, eventually dropping out of high school.  Career  While in junior high school Grace became a fan of punk rock, attracted to the nihilistic and anarchistic ideals of the genre. At age 13, she played bass in her first band, known as both the Black Shadows and the Leather Dice as they had never agreed on a name. The band was formed with members of her youth group at church. Their first gigs were at church talent shows playing Nirvana and Pearl Jam covers. An arrest at age 14 crystallized her aversion to authority: having gone to the beach on Independence Day 1995 to watch fireworks, \\"I walked up on the boardwalk, and a cop was like 'Hey, get off the boardwalk; you're blocking the flow of traffic'. So I turned around and got off, and he came up to me again and was like, 'Get off the boardwalk.' And I was like 'I'm off the boardwalk. Grace claims to have then been slammed into a police car, thrown face-first to the pavement, jumped on, hogtied, carried \\"like a suitcase\\", put in a holding cell, not allowed to call her mom at that time, charged with resisting arrest and battery, placed under house arrest for the summer, and required to do 180 hours of community service, all because \\"I was a dirty, grubby little punk kid with black spiky hair who hadn't washed his pants in a year.\\" Grace's mother hired an attorney, whom she could ill afford, who took the case to court and lost. Grace was charged as an adult and ultimately convicted of both felonies. Grace later said the experience \\"changed my life. [It] politicized me.\\" \\"I have an inherent trust of mankind. I think authority and government base their power on violence. I refuse to recognize anyone's power over me.\\" After that incident, Grace came to identify with British anarcho-punk band Crass, calling them \\"to me, the best band to ever blend music and politics\\": \\"I felt like Crass' music legitimately made a change. They really backed up what they were doing. I saw that writing a song against something was just as valid as standing on a street corner holding a sign.\\" Grace befriended James Bowman when they met on their first day of freshman year at Naples High School; the two have been close ever since.\\" We were both punk rock kids with spiky hair and more belts than necessary\\", recalls Bowman. \\"We just hung out and smoked pot and did normal kid things.\\" Grace's first tattoo‚Äîa Crass logo on the right ankle‚Äîwas done by Bowman, though she later covered it up with a tattoo of the Rebel Alliance symbol because Bowman had been drunk and inked it sloppily. At age 16, Grace published a zine called \\"Misanthrope,\\" which dealt mostly with political issues of the time. The \\"highlight of her career\\" was interviewing Bobby Seale. Grace played bass in a band called the Adversaries with Dustin Fridkin and a \\"revolving cast\\" of drummers from 1994 to 1996. The lineups were not stable, and the band had various names, including the Snot Rockets, Upper Crust, and eventually the Adversaries. The Adversaries released one (obscure) demo. Their \\"crowning achievement as a band\\" (according to Grace) was playing at \\"The Hardback\\" in Gainesville, FL. The breakup of the Adversaries led to Grace briefly playing in a band called Common Affliction in 1996. The ending of Common Affliction led to Grace recording the first Against Me! demo tape in December 1996. 1997‚Äì2005 In 1997, at age 17, Grace dropped out of high school and began writing songs, naming the musical project Against Me!. Moving to Gainesville, Florida at 18, she began performing as Against Me!, either alone on an acoustic guitar or with friend Kevin Mahon accompanying by drumming on pickle buckets. Her songs drew influence from early acoustic protest music, covering topics such as class struggle. Early Against Me! shows were played at dive bars, laundromats, and anywhere else that would allow Grace to perform, to audiences of a few or even zero. Making ends meet by working odd jobs, dumpster diving, selling blood plasma, and living in a low- rent house with twelve roommates across the street from an experimental waste dump, Grace also volunteered with nonprofit socialist groups such as Food Not Bombs. She was arrested again at 18 for obstruction of justice and resisting arrest without violence: \\"I was picking up [Mahon]. He was like, 'Pop the trunk‚ÄîI want to throw some stuff in there.' I was waiting in the car and I saw two cop cars come up behind me. I got out and they had my friend on the ground. I went up to the first officer I saw and said, 'Excuse me, officer, what's going on?' He's like, 'Down on the ground‚Äîyou're going to jail.' I started to ask another question and he grabbed me, slammed me into the cop car, and arrested me.\\" In 2000, Grace convinced Bowman to move to Gainesville and began teaching him how to play Against Me! songs on guitar. After some early EP releases, Against Me! developed into a full band consisting of Grace, Bowman, bassist Dustin Fridkin, and drummer Warren Oakes. Their debut album, Against Me! Is Reinventing Axl Rose, was released in 2002 through local independent record label No Idea Records. With Fridkin replaced by Andrew Seward, the band signed to DIY indie record label Fat Wreck Chords for 2003's Against Me! as the Eternal Cowboy and 2005's Searching for a Former Clarity. The name As the Eternal Cowboy was symbolic of the old fashioned concept of the Western cowboy, always wandering the plains lost and lonely. It was envisioned by Grace as a concept record about love and war. Searching sold over 65,000 copies and was their first album to chart on the Billboard 200, reaching 114. Against Me! supported it with a tour of all 50 U.S. states. As Against Me!'s popularity increased, Grace felt alienated from the male-centric punk scene: \\"With the band especially, I felt more and more like I was putting on an act ‚Äì like I was being shoved into this role of 'angry white man in a punk band. The stresses of the band's tour schedule, coupled with going through a divorce at age 24, contributed to her addiction: \\"I was just getting fucked up all the time: drinking, drugs, whatever. I felt unhealthy and depressed about so many things\\". Throughout this time Grace made oblique references to gender dysphoria in song lyrics, including \\"The Disco Before the Breakdown\\" (\\"I know they're going to laugh at us / when they see us out together 'holding hands' like this\\"), \\"Violence\\" (\\"You've been keeping secrets ... Nothing but shame and paranoia\\"), and \\"Searching for a Former Clarity\\" (\\"In the journal you kept by the side of your bed ... confessing childhood secrets of dressing up in women's clothes / Compulsions you never knew the reasons to\\"). To help escape the stress and depression, Grace spent 18 months living in hotels on the outskirts of Gainesville while writing the next Against Me! album. 2006‚Äì2011 Against Me! at the 2007 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival In December 2005, Against Me! signed to Sire Records, a subsidiary of the Warner Music Group. With increased mainstream exposure, Grace swore off cross-dressing and other expressions of femininity: \\"You go through periods of binging and purging. I was 25, we were about to go on a long period of touring, and I was like, 'That's it. I'm getting rid of all this. I'm male, and that's it. Against Me!'s first major-label album, 2007's New Wave, brought the band mainstream success: It debuted at no. 57 on the Billboard 200; featured their first charting single, \\"Thrash Unreal\\", which reached no. 11 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart; and was named as Spins album of the year. The song \\"The Ocean\\" directly referenced Grace's gender dysphoria, with the lyrics \\"If I could have chosen, I would have been born a woman / My mother once told me she would have named me Laura / I would grow up to be strong and beautiful like her / One day I'd find an honest man to make my husband\\". Though Grace anticipated \\"completely outing myself\\" with the song, no one involved with the band seemed to pick up on the lyrics' literal meaning. She also wanted to cross-dress in the music video for \\"Thrash Unreal\\", but the label's A&R; representative vetoed the idea. In August 2007 Grace was arrested in Tallahassee, Florida, on charges of battery, following a confrontation with a coffee shop patron after Grace tore down an article about Against Me! that had been hung up and defaced to mock the band. Grace allegedly knocked a cup out of the man's hand, then forced his head into the wooden counter. She admitted to intentionally knocking over the cup but denied hitting the man, and was released on bail the following morning. \\"We were playing at this place The Beta Bar,\\" she said, \\"and this coffee shop next door was having a protest show against ours. I mean... go protest the fucking war!\\" Grace's solo EP, Heart Burns, was released in October 2008. Timed to coincide with that year's United States presidential election, the EP's songs addressed the country's political and economic climate, criticizing presidential candidate John McCain and the trial of environmental activist Eric McDavid. \\"I wanted to do something that was the complete opposite of New Wave in the sense of approach\\", she said. \\"I didn't want to really think about it. I didn't want to obsess about anything. I just wanted to go in and play songs. I wanted to record because it'll be fun, and that's what this is supposed to be about.\\" Grace supported the EP by performing on The Revival Tour with Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music, Tim Barry of Avail, and Ben Nichols of Lucero. Against Me!'s fifth studio album, White Crosses, was released in 2010 and became their most successful, reaching no. 34 on the Billboard 200. By that September, however, Grace began taking week-long writing trips alone, checking into hotels dressed as a woman and writing a concept album titled Transgender Dysphoria Blues, about a transsexual prostitute. The record was positively received. Against Me! cancelled a series of tour dates in October and November 2010 due to \\"a culmination of circumstances engulfing us\\", and left Sire/Warner. In 2011, Grace purchased an abandoned post office in Elkton, Florida, converting it into a recording studio called Total Treble and launched an accompanying record label for future Against Me! releases, Total Treble Music. The first album recorded at the studio was Cheap Girls' Giant Orange (2012), which also marked Grace's first experience as a record producer. Total Treble Studio closed in 2013 after being destroyed in a storm.  2012‚Äìpresent  In spring 2012, Grace performed on the Revival Tour with Chuck Ragan and Cory Branan. In July 2018, it was announced that Grace would release an album in the fall of 2018 under the name Laura Jane Grace and the Devouring Mothers on Chicago-based Bloodshot Records. The record, Bought to Rot, was made with bassist Marc Jacob Hudson and drummer Atom Willard (Against Me!, Angels & Airwaves, The Offspring). The release will include a tour with a three night weekly residency in Chicago.  Writing  In 2015, Grace wrote a column called \\"Mandatory Happiness\\" for the Vice Media publication Noisey. On November 15, 2016, Grace's memoir Tranny: Confessions Of Punk Rock's Most Infamous Anarchist Sellout, co-written with Noisey editor Dan Ozzi, was published. Much of the book is based on Grace's journals, which she'd kept since third grade. The book was known under a working title of Kill Me Loudly or Killing Me Loudly in 2015, when Grace was working with a different publisher.  Politics  Grace has said that she is an anarchist. After leaving Naples, Italy and moving to Naples, Florida, Grace said that she discovered punk rock music around the age of 13. Around the age of 15 or 16 years old, Grace said that she also discovered the anarcho-punk and activist punk rock movements, which she found appealing for its feminist and anti-hate stance against racism, homophobia, and its embrace of body liberation. Grace said she has been influenced by these concepts as core values since learning about them. A band that Grace cites frequently as an example of politics and music is Crass, an English art collective and punk rock band formed in 1977. However, as Against Me! became more successful, the constraints of the punk rock scene, which often had rigid sets of rules, were difficult to embrace, especially during the times when Grace was struggling with gender dysphoria. At a May 2016 Against Me! show in Durham, North Carolina, Grace set her birth certificate on fire in protest of the North Carolina bathroom bill. Grace said \\"Goodbye gender\\" during this act of protest. Other work Grace participated in a 10-part documentary called True Trans where she interviewed \\"gender variant people from all walks of life\\" to allow them to tell their stories, in addition to telling hers. In 2015, the show was nominated for an Emmy for New Approaches: Arts, Lifestyle, Culture. In 2015, Grace worked with Joan Jett and Miley Cyrus to make videos for the \\"Happy Hippie Foundation\\" to raise money for homeless LGBT youth. Personal life In 2000, Grace married Tiffany Danielle Kay. The marriage ended in divorce four years later in 2004. In March 2006, while touring as an opening act for Alkaline Trio, Grace met visual artist Heather Hannoura, who designed merchandise for Alkaline Trio and other bands. The two spent the summer together on the Warped Tour, began living together, and got tattoos of each other's names. They married in December 2007, after a year-long engagement. Grace and Hannoura have a daughter together, Evelyn, born October 30, 2009. Grace's feelings of dysphoria \\"started coming back really strong\\" about the time Hannoura became pregnant that February, but were not acted on. The family moved to St. Augustine, Florida, in 2010, when Evelyn was about a year old. The couple separated and then divorced in 2013. In 2006, Grace became a vegan. Grace has lived in Chicago since 2013. She released a song ‚ÄúI Hate Chicago‚Äù in 2018 that criticised many aspects of the city. Transition Grace experienced feelings of gender dysphoria from a young age, citing them as her \\"earliest memories\\". Grace publicly came out as a transgender woman in May 2012. Grace announced plans to begin transitioning. Having been inspired to come out after meeting a transgender Against Me! fan, Grace had informed the rest of the band that February. At the time, she also mentioned plans to undergo electrolysis. She has said she may consider breast implants and facial plastic surgery, but has remained apprehensive about chondrolaryngoplasty and bottom surgery, in 2012 saying, \\"I don't give a fuck if I lose my penis. It's just fucking scary because of the surgery. I've needed to have my wisdom teeth removed for five years, and I still haven't.\\" She said in a May 2012 interview with Rolling Stone that she would live as a woman and undergo psychotherapy for a year before considering sex reassignment surgery: \\"Right now, I'm in this awkward transition period. I look like a dude, and feel like a dude, and it sucks. But eventually I'll flip, and I'll present as female.\\" In 2015, Grace said, \\"I think it's perfectly valid [for a trans person] to never undergo bottom surgery\\". The singer now goes by the name Laura Jane Grace. \\"Laura\\" is the name her mother would have chosen had she been assigned female at birth; \\"Jane\\" was selected simply because she thinks it's pretty; \\"Grace\\" is her mother's maiden name. Grace and her wife are currently going through divorce proceedings, and have been separated since August 2013. Grace plans to continue performing in Against Me!, saying \\"However fierce our band was in the past, imagine me, six-foot-two, in heels, fucking screaming into someone's face.\\" In response to Grace's announcement, a number of figures in the punk community voiced their support, including musicians Brian Fallon, Brendan Kelly, Franz Nicolay, and Mike Shinoda; cartoonist Mitch Clem; and mixed martial artist CM Punk. Herndon Graddick, President of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, hoped that Grace's public profile would increase public awareness and acceptance of trans people: \\"[Laura] is displaying extraordinary courage by coming out as transgender after already establishing herself as a rock star. For many of the band's fans, this may be the first time they're actually thinking about transgender people and the bravery it sometimes takes in order to be true to yourself.\\" In May 2012 at a San Diego Against Me! show, Grace performed under her new name for the first time. Grace confirmed in January 2019 that she underwent facial feminisation surgery in December 2018, as part of her transition. Discography  Against Me!  ;Studio albums * 2002: Against Me!

Levy was granted the \\"freedom of the country\\" by the government of Peru for signal services rendered in the Peruvian Navy. Early life and education Jonas Phillips Levy was born in 1807 in Philadelphia to Michael Levy and Rachel Phillips, a Jewish-American couple. His older brother Uriah Phillips Levy became the first Jewish commodore in the United States Navy. His maternal grandfather Jonas Phillips immigrated from Germany in the mid-1700s. His great-great-grandfather had come from London and was one of a group of the earliest settlers in Savannah, Georgia. He was a descendant of Sephardic Jews who had fled to Europe and England after the Spanish Inquisition of the early 16th century. Marriage and family Jonas Phillips Levy married Frances (Fanny) Mitchell on November 22, 1848. They had five children together: Jefferson Monroe, Louis Napoleon, Mitchell Abraham Cass, Isabella, and Amelia. Their son Jefferson Monroe became a lawyer and financier in New York, and an admirer of Thomas Jefferson, as his father and uncle Uriah were. In 1879, at the age of 27, Jefferson Monroe financially took control of Thomas Jefferson's home Monticello, which his uncle Uriah Levy had purchased and restored in 1834. Like Uriah, Jefferson Monroe invested his personal funds (in the amount of hundreds of thousands of dollars) to restore and preserve the mansion and of grounds. He also purchased that originally belonged to the plantation. In 1923, Monticello was purchased by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation to be preserved and operated as a house museum. Career Jonas Levy became a merchant and sea captain. He commanded the U.S.S. America during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848), and was assigned to the transportation of troops to Veracruz. When the port surrendered, Levy was appointed its captain by Gen. Winfield Scott. In addition, he aided the Peruvian Navy, in which he served for some time. The government honored him with \\"freedom of the country\\" for his contributions. In 1852, he became the second and, to date the last, person to be indicted under the Logan Act. Levy, who was living in Mexico at the time, had acquired a grant to build a railway across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the narrowest point across Mexico. Secretary of State Daniel Webster had been pressuring Mexico to accept a treaty that would allow a different group of American businessmen to build the railway. Levy wrote a letter to Mexican President Mariano Arista urging him to reject Webster's proposed treaty, prompting Webster to seek an indictment against Levy for violating the Logan Act. Federal prosecutors were forced to dismiss the case after Arista refused to hand over the original copy of the letter, depriving them of the evidence they needed to convict Levy. Levy was among the founders of the Washington Hebrew Congregation (WHC) in Washington DC and served as its fifth president from 1857 to 1858. Levy and other members of Washington Hebrew Congregation were so well politically connected that they secured from the U.S. Congress an \\"Act for the Benefit of the Hebrew Congregation in the City of Washington\\". The act guaranteed for WHC the same rights and immunities accorded to other religious bodies in the District of Columbia. President Franklin Pierce signed the act into law on June 2, 1856, and it is the only Act of Congress that serves as a charter for a Jewish Congregation in the United States.

Olof af Acrel was born at √ñster√•ker, and was the brother of the missionary Israel Acrelius. After attending Uppsala University for two years, he trained as a surgeon in Stockholm. From 1740, he spent several years in Germany and France, studying at the University of G√∂ttingen under Albrecht von Haller and also in Paris and Strasbourg. In 1743, during the War of the Austrian Succession, he was appointed acting chief surgeon at a French military hospital in Lauterbourg, Alsace. A year later, the town was captured by German troops and, after being briefly imprisoned, Acrel returned to Sweden. In 1752, he was appointed chief surgeon of the newly founded Seraphim Hospital in Stockholm, and as professor of surgery in 1755. He was awarded a doctorate of medicine by Uppsala University in 1760. Acrel's discourse on the Reforms necessary in Surgical Operations made a deep impression. So did his other works, On the Mode of Treating Recent Wounds; On Surgery in general; and On the Cataract of the Eye. He received many honours in recognition of his work. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1746. He died in Stockholm.

Titles The View from the Mirror consists of four books: *A Shadow on the Glass *The Tower on the Rift *Dark is the Moon *The Way Between the Worlds The Three Worlds Cycle In the Three Worlds Cycle,Ian Irvine's bibliography there are naturally Three Worlds. These Three Worlds are separated by the Void, a place of incredible ferocity and violence. Not much is known about the Void, but what is known is that it is a place where life is brutal and fleeting and those who live within must constantly re-make themselves to ensure their survival. The names of the Three Worlds are: *Aachan *Santhenar or Santh *Tallallame The Four Species There are also 4 species of humans that populate these worlds. The names of the species are: *Aachim *Charon *Old Humans *Faellem The Aachim are the original species of Aachan. They are usually a tall, dark people who can be rather arrogant. They are long lived, though to a lesser extent than the Faellem and Charon. But there is an exception both physically and emotionally with the people of Clan Elienor. These people are small (for Aachim anyway) pale and have red hair. They are usually less long lived than the rest of the Aachim, though Malien is an exception. The people of Clan Elienor are often a lot more caring to others and hope for the prosperity of all human species. The Aachim were mostly brought to Santhenar as the Charon's slaves. A few, such as Tensor, came of their own accord. The Charon are a tall, dark people with carmine/indigo eyes and are great users of the Secret Art. They are very long lived, as are the Faellem. They were once Mariem and shared the world of Tallallame with the Faellem. But the Faellem saw how the Mariem were destroying their beautiful world with their machines and devices of magic and knew that, if they continued, that the Faellem would soon become extinct. So the Faellem gathered their most powerful mancers together and learnt how to use magical \\"gates\\" as the Mariam did, and cast their foes into the void. The Mariem quickly dwindled in that horrific place. But they remade themselves. Giving themselves a new name, Charon, after a frigid moonlet at the furthest extremity of the void, they took Aachan from the Aachim. The Hundred, as the remaining Charon became known, dared allow nothing to stand before the survival of their species. While the Aachim were millions, they were too frightened of the Charon to retaliate. The greatest among the Charon, Rulke, eventually opened the way between the worlds, which caused all the troubles of The Three Worlds. Only three Charon ever ventured to Santhenar: Rulke, Yalkara and Kandor. The old humans are the original species of Santhenar and are the only species that are not long lived. It is rarer among them to have great talents for the Art, though a lot of people among them have minor talents. The other species think of them as primitive. Old Humans are the most human-like species of the four in The Three Worlds series. The Faellem are a small, dour people with translucent skin and golden eyes. They are very long lived and their powers with the Art are mostly in the form of illusion, deception, confusion and enchantment. Their home world is Tallallame. Faelamor is their leader and is seen as the most powerful illusionist on the Three Worlds. The Faellem long ago resorted to genocide and sent the Mariem to what they thought was their death in the void. After this, the use of the powers they employed to achieve this, were banned among the Faellem as was the use of machines and devices. Faelamor led a group of her people to Santhenar, though more recently had been exiled with Maigraith for a great unknown reason, that involved Maigraith's parents. A Triune is a blending of three species. They are not considered a species, as the majority of them are sterile. They are, however, renowned for their special abilities. Other species The Lyrinx are described as humanoids with huge wings, armour plating, six inch claws on their hands and feet, mouths big enough for a human head to fit inside and chameleonic skin. Lyrinx also have golden flecked, intelligent eyes and crests on their heads which show maturity and gender. Sometimes, a lyrinx infant is born lacking one or more of these features. Such children are allowed to fight if they are able and otherwise live normal lives but they are forbidden from breeding, to stop the deformities being passed on to future generations. Despite their monstrous appearance, Lyrinx are as intelligent as humans and have a strong sense of honour and have the skill of flesh forming. Main characters Karan A young sensitive woman, from Gothryme Manor in Bannador. She is called upon to help steal the wicked Mirror of Aachan and is hunted far and wide by many who desire it. Karan uses her skills to outwit many of the great and soon finds herself with many enemies. Karan falls in love with Llian, with whom she faces many dangers. Llian A talented master chronicler and teller from Chanthed, Llian is a Zain and strives hard to rise above the stigma of being of that race. He is overly curious and this often causes strife. Llian soon falls in love with Karan and together they face many perils. Because of his ambitious nature, Llian is often questioned about where his loyalties lie. Faelamor The age old leader of the Faellem, Faelamor is unceasingly searching for a way home to her beloved Tallallame. For the past three hundred years it was believed that Faelamor was dead, however she herself spread this rumour, before creating the false identity of Faichand. In this time Faelamor constructs a brilliant plan to lead her people home to Tallallame, that centres around her lieutenant Maigraith. Maigraith The brilliant lieutenant of Faelamor, Maigraith was orphaned at a young age and knows nothing of her heritage. Though a master of the Secret Art, Maigraith is so dominated by Faelamor and is unsure of herself and her myriad of skills, that her strength is often beyond her reach. Maigraith feels compelled to aid Faelamor to lead her people home. Malien An Aachim woman and the former consort of Tensor and mother of Rael, Malien is the kinswoman of Karan. After Tensor's betrayal, Malien takes over the leadership of the Aachim and seeks to aid all levels of humanity, not just her own Aachim people. Malien utilises her powers with the Secret Art and skills at healing many times during her journeys. Yggur An age old mancer, bent on seeking revenge on Mendark and the Council of Santhenar for betrayals committed one thousand years ago during the taking of Rulke. Yggur is deathly afraid of Rulke, often paralysed by fear of him. It is this inner hurt that draws Maigraith, who he ever after loves, to him. Shand An old man from the village of Tullin, Shand is clearly more than he seems, though he often denies it. It is clear that Shand is tortured by a past failure and loss, which he has never been able to come to terms with. After their adventures together Shand begins to think of Karan as a daughter. Tensor The leader of the Aachim and former partner of Malien. Tensor is consumed by hubris and it is his folly that unleashes Rulke upon the world. He embarks on more than one doomed scheme and is determined to return the Aachim to their former glory, whatever the cost. Tallia The chief lieutenant of Mendark, Tallia is a master of the Secret Art, as well as of armed and unarmed combat. She forms a strong bond with Lilis, who she cares for as a daughter. Tallia accompanies Mendark on all of his journeys, though she soon begins to have doubts about his intentions. Mendark The Magister of the Council of Santhenar, for the past one thousand years, Mendark is a powerful mancer, who has recently become insecure, due to the threat of his nemesis Yggur. He is corrupt and selfish, though he truly cares for his world, though this is often overshadowed by his need to secure a great reputation in the Histories. Rulke (aka The Great Betrayer) The greatest of the Charon, who has been imprisoned in the Nightland for the past one thousand years, though he is released upon the world by Tensor. It soon becomes clear that Rulke's evil reputation is, at least partly, a lie. Rulke is obsessed with the survival of his people. Nadiril (aka Nadiril the Sage) The revered Librarian of the Great Library and a member of the Council of Santhenar, Nadiril is a man with the knowledge of the world at his fingertips. He takes on Lilis as his apprentice and later they both journey to Thurkad, so Nadiril can participate in the doings of the Council and the allies alike. Lilis Lilis was a street urchin and waif, whose father was press ganged seven years ago. She escapes the taking of Thurkad with Tallia and Mendark's group and upon arriving at Zile, Lilis takes up the position as Nadiril's apprentice. Lilis's father, Jevander is eventually rescued, by Tallia and the pair are reunited. Mirror of Aachan The Mirror of Aachan is an object of magic. It is a twisted, deceitful thing that never forgets a single thing it is witness to. It is sometimes referred to as \\"The Glass\\", \\"The Twisted Mirror\\" or \\"The Mirror\\" by the characters.

They are located north of Florence on U.S. Highway 101, about midpoint on the Oregon Coast. In this area Highway 101 follows a steep and undeveloped seascape above sea level. Human access to the caves is through a gift shop building. Description The cave system is at sea level and the ocean continually washes into the main cavern which has a floor area of about and a vaulted rock dome about high. Southward from the main chamber, a low passage runs to a sea level opening. This corridor is flooded at high tide and free of water at low tide. The western entrance is a short, high passage through which the ocean washes at all tide levels. At the north, a third entrance is about above the ocean which serves as an elevated observation area where the entire cave system and its wildlife are visible. Lichens, algae, and mineral stains cover the cavern walls with greens, pinks, purples, buffs, and reds on the rough surfaces, some of which are named Lincoln's Head, the Indian Maiden, and The Goddess of Liberty. The sea level portion of this cave and the sea cliff rocks just outside the cave have become, over the centuries, the only known mainland rookery and hauling area (wintering home) of the Steller's sea lion and‚Äîto a lesser extent‚Äîthe California sea lion. The high vault is a natural resting place for sea birds. Many birds make their home at or near the Sea Lion Caves such as the pigeon guillemot, Brandt's cormorant, western, herring, and California gulls, tufted puffins, and the occasional hawk or bald eagle. Sea Lion Caves is one of the great sea caves of the world, and currently ranks 10th among the world's longest sea caves http://www.caverbob.com/seacave.htm. With a measured length of 1315 feet, it is the longest in the United States. A comparable cave is the undeveloped Painted Cave on Santa Cruz Island, California, which is 1227 feet long. The whale watching deck, located below the gift shop, permits a seaward view of approximately . The deck is at an elevation of , making it a popular whale watching post. Typically, orcas are seen migrating once a year past the Sea Lion Caves, whereas the gray whale is seen anywhere from a few months to all year long. Small groups sometimes end their migration in the immediate vicinity, feeding very close to the shore. History The gift shop in the early 1930s Sea Lion Caves were discovered in 1880 by a local seaman, Captain William Cox, who entered the grotto through the western channel in a small boat on a calm day. He reportedly returned to explore the caves a number of times and on one occasion was marooned for several days because of stormy weather and rough ocean. He reportedly sustained himself by shooting a young sea lion and eating the meat of its flippers. Regardless of the incident's authenticity, it is established that Captain Cox purchased the land in 1887 from the State of Oregon. His family owned the property until 1926. There were no roads in the area at that time. The slopes of the rocky headlands were used for sheep pasture. Access to the caves from the hillside above was not even considered until after the land was acquired by R. E. Clanton in 1927, with the specific intention of opening the caves as a business. In 1930, when it became probable that U.S. Route 101 would be completed going past the site, Clanton was joined by J. G. Houghton, and J. E. Jacobson. The three partners decided to risk all their money to build a safe access to the cave. A trail was excavated by hand into the face of the cliff. At the bottom, a 135 step wooden tower was extended down to the north entrance of the caves. Despite the difficulty and danger of the construction, the trail and stairs provided safe access for visitors and the Sea Lion Caves opened to the public in August 1932. The traffic was light at first. The highway was a gravel road until 1934, and until 1937 there were five ferry crossings within 100 miles to traverse the highway. However, word of the attraction spread and the number of people visiting the Sea Lion Caves slowly grew until 1942, when virtually all recreational travel halted due to World War II. Meanwhile, Clanton withdrew from the partnership in 1934 and R. A. Saubert became part owner. The three families operated the Sea Lion Caves until 2006, when the Saubert and Jacobson families took over the partnership. In 1961, the addition of an elevator resulted in a sharp rise in the number of visitors. The elevator took three years to build, but by June 1961, Otis Elevator Company completed the elevator. It has a capacity of 23 passengers and travels at 250 feet per minute (). It can accommodate 400 people per hour. In 2019, the 58 year old elevator was replaced with a new one, as parts for the old elevator were becoming obsolete and having the be hand crafted.

As Colin fights himself, a commentator (John Cleese, with Michael Palin as MC in both versions) hastily reports the events. Sir Arthur Harris was the Air Marshal of the RAF during the second World War. His heavy use of four engine bombers during the war earned him the nickname \\"Bomber Harris\\". The routine dates back to Chapman's college days and he also performed it in the first episode of At Last The 1948 Show, broadcast in the UK on 15 February 1967. It was later adopted by the Pythons, who filmed a version for the second Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus episode, broadcast in Germany on 18 December 1972. The routine also featured in many of the troupe's live shows and can be seen in the film of Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982). It was also cited in Monty Python's Personal Best as one of Graham Chapman's best sketches. Harris holds The sketch includes the following moves: # The \\"Hand Hold\\" in which Colin simultaneously attempts to grab his own hand while trying to fight it away, eventually failing. Cleese remarks, \\"He's going for the hand hold...he's got it.\\" # Working on his 'weak left knee' # Biting his own foot, which earns him a public warning from the referee and much ire from himself. # The \\"Double Overhead Nostril\\", where Colin brings his arm upwards, lowering his hand over his face and inserting his middle and index fingers into his nose. # Colin succeeds in gaining a fall by lying on the ground and bringing his legs up beside his head, locking his knees in his elbows called the \\"Double Overhead\\" in the Fliegender Zirkus Version. # A \\"Strawberry whip\\", \\"Vanilla whip\\", and \\"Chocolate whip\\", called \\"the flying Welshman\\" and \\"the half Egyptian\\" in the Fliegender Zirkus version, usually consisting of three forward somersaults while he elbows himself in the back of his neck. # \\"Colin's most famous hold, the one-neck-over-shoulder-Gerry Ford\\" (Known as \\"The famous over-right-shoulder-Gerry Ford in the City Center version) called the half-crab in the Fliegender Zirkus version, where Colin's right leg is brought over his shoulder, and he crawls along the ground in a pained manner with his remaining arm and leg. He manages to crawl to the ropes, and Cleese remarks that he was \\"lucky there\\". # Colin manages to catch himself by surprise by bringing his arms around his neck, his hands firmly pressing the ground in an attempt to pin; this move is known as the \\"Double Eydie Gorm√©\\" and is called \\"the neck pin\\" in the Fliegender Zirkus version. He is able to twist out of it. Match result * The match ends with Colin hitting himself in the head with his forearm, effectively knocking himself out. He is declared the winner, but is announced to meet himself again in the coming finals.

He was the immigrant ancestor of the Jewish Phillips family in the United States. Emigrating from Germany in 1759, Phillips worked off his passage as an indentured servant in Charleston, South Carolina. He moved to the North in 1759, becoming a merchant in New York City and then moving to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A founder of Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia during the war, Phillips and his wife had a total of twenty-one children. One of their great- grandsons was Franklin J. Moses, Jr., who was elected as governor of South Carolina in 1872 during the Reconstruction era; his father Franklin J. Moses, Sr. was Chief Justice of the state supreme court.Benjamin Ginsberg, Moses of South Carolina: A Jewish Scalawag during Radical Reconstruction (Google eBook), Baltimore, Maryland: JHU Press, 2010 Another notable grandson was Uriah Phillips Levy, the first Jewish Commodore in the United States Navy. Childhood and emigration Jonas Phillips was born in 1736 to an Ashkenazi Jewish family in Germany, in either Buseck or Frankfort am Main (Frankfurt). He was the son of Aaron Phillips, who had anglicized his name, and his wife. Phillips grew up speaking Yiddish and later learned English. At the age of 20, the ambitious Phillips emigrated to the British colonies in North America, sailing from London in November 1756. Working as an indentured servant to pay off his passage, he lived in Charleston, S.C.. He was employed by Moses Lindo, an indigo planter and Sephardic Jew who was part of the growing Jewish community in the city. By the beginning of the 19th century, Charleston was home to the largest and wealthiest Jewish community in North America, a status it would hold until about 1830. In 1759, Jonas Phillips completed his indenture and became a \\"freeman.\\" He left the South, moving first to Albany, New York, the state capital. He soon moved to New York City, where he became a merchant. By 1760, Phillips had joined a lodge of Freemasons in New York. Phillips left Albany to secure an introduction to Rebecca Mendez Machado, daughter of a Sephardic Jewish family in New York City.Aviva Ben-Ur, \\"The Exceptional and the Mundane: A Biographical Portrait of Rebecca (Machado) Phillips, 1746-1831\\" , p. 370, Published electronically in Textures and Meaning: Thirty Years of Judaic Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, ed. L. Ehrlich, S. Bolozky, R. Rothstein, M. Schwartz, J. Berkovitz, J. Young, Department of Judaic and Near Eastern Studies, University of Massachusetts Amherst, ¬© 2004. They married and eventually had 21 children together. American Revolutionary War Phillips was attracted to the ideals that led to the American Revolutionary War. In 1770 he strongly supported the Non-Importation Agreement, and favored the Patriot cause at the outbreak of war. In 1776 he used his influence in his Jewish congregation to close the synagogue and leave New York, rather than continue under British rule. The building was abandoned. Together with the majority of the congregation, Phillips and his family moved to Philadelphia, where he continued in business until 1778. In that year he joined the Revolutionary Army, serving in the Philadelphia Militia under Colonel Bradford. Yiddish code In July 28, 1776, Phillips wrote in Yiddish to a relative and business correspondent, Gumpel Samson of the Netherlands. He discussed the conflict with Great Britain and said the Americans (Patriots) had 100,000 soldiers compared to the 25,000 of the British. He included an appendix of items he wanted to import for sale in America.Marcus, , American Jewish Archives, Vol. XXVII, November 1975, p. 111. Thrilled with the Revolution, Phillips enclosed a copy of the Declaration of Independence. Phillips' use of Yiddish prevented most British from being able to read the letter (although they also had German Jewish immigrants in their culture). The British who intercepted the letter did not recognize the language and thought the letter was in code. Civil rights for Jews In a petition dated September 7, 1787, Phillips addressed the Constitutional Convention, which was meeting in Philadelphia. To support religious freedom, he asked them to avoid making a Christian religious test in the constitution for Federal office holders. Other Jewish activities Phillips was one of the founder members of Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia. When its synagogue on Pine Street was consecrated in 1782, he was serving as president of the congregation. After the Revolution, he and his family moved to New York for a time, but soon after returned to Philadelphia. Phillips continued to reside there until his death. While the congregation left that first synagogue and the property was redeveloped, its cemetery at the site has been preserved and is designated as a National Historic Landmark. Death and burial Phillips died at Philadelphia, on January 29, 1803. His remains were interred at New York in the cemetery on New Bowery of Congregation Shearith Israel. His widow Rebecca Machado Phillips lived until 1831. Legacy Phillips and Rebecca had 21 children together. Their descendants became educated and continued to contribute to the United States. One of their great-grandsons was Franklin J. Moses, Jr., who was elected as governor of South Carolina in 1872. His father, Franklin J. Moses, Sr. was elected as Chief Justice of the state supreme court in 1868. Another grandson was Uriah Phillips Levy, the first Jewish Commodore in the United States Navy. In 1834, he bought Monticello eight years after President Thomas Jefferson's death, and used his own money to preserve the house and estate for the American people.Marc Leepson, Saving Monticello: The Levy Family's Epic Quest to Rescue the House that Jefferson Built (University of Virginia Press, 2003) See also *Jonas Phillips Levy Footnotes References Jewish Encyclopedia article on the Phillips family * Leepson, Marc, Saving Monticello: the Levy Family's Epic Quest to Rescue the House that Jefferson Built, University of Virginia Press, 2003.

Yaquina Bay is a semi-enclosed body of water, approximately 8 km¬≤ (3.2 mi¬≤) in area, with free connection to the Pacific Ocean, but also diluted with freshwater from the Yaquina River land drainage. The Bay is traversed by the Yaquina Bay Bridge. There are three small communities that border the Yaquina River and Bay; Newport (population approx. 9,989), Toledo (population approx. 3,459) and Elk City (population approx. 25). The Yaquina Bay in Newport is a popular tourist destination along the Pacific Coast Highway. It is also an important estuary for the ecology and economy of the area.  History of Yaquina Bay  Yaquina Bay is named after the Yaquina Tribe that occupied the territory along the Yaquina River. With the railroad addition In the late 1880s, many thought Yaquina Bay would be the commerce center for the Pacific Northwest. Wheat, lumber, and other goods were transported to Yaquina Bay as the area began to develop. Oyster companies and other merchandise organizations began to take residence in the Bay.  Exploration and settlement  American Indians had called Yaquina Bay home for years until the westward expansion. In 1856, the first vessel entered Yaquina Bay carrying supplies for Siletz Block-houses up the Yaquina River. The newfound Bay access promised a great deal of advantages, particularly open transportation and shipping to and from San Francisco Bay. Also in 1856, a doctor from the Willamette Valley was appointed surgeon to an Indian agency in Yaquina Bay. Following Indian trails through the Coast Range, the doctor, along with three other explorers, set out for the coast in quest for his new appointment. In 1861, Captain Spencer, from the state of Washington, first settled in Yaquina Bay. Spencer, with the assistance of a local Indian guide, discovered valuable oyster beds within the Bay, which would attract future businesses, particularly firms from San Francisco. In 1866, news spread of the promises and new life Yaquina Bay had to offer and quickly brought a surge of settlers to the area. Newport was quickly formed and oyster companies and other industries began to take resident. The growing oyster business initiated the construction of a wagon road from Corvallis to Yaquina Bay, costing approximately $20,000 and spanning 45 miles. The road was completed in 1873 and promised continued connections between Corvallis and the coast, and even helped settlers reach their new coastal home. With the influx of residents, seasonal visitors to the area, and booming businesses, Yaquina Bay's oyster trade quickly began to decline. In 1869, a group of oystermen formed a task force with the interest of preserving oyster beds. To better the public's interest and their own, they worked diligently to restore and protect the oyster communities. thumb Shortly after the establishment of Newport, the Yaquina Bay lighthouse began construction in 1871. However, with the establishment of the Yaquina Head lighthouse to the north, it was decommissioned in 1874. For a long time, Yaquina Bay was the midpoint between San Francisco and Seattle. With increased ship and navigation traffic into the area, the number of shipwrecks increased rapidly.  Past uses  Historical uses of Yaquina Bay include commercial oyster farming and fishing, recreational clamming, and shipping and navigation.Brophy, L. (1999).

Economy  Recreational boats on the Yaquina Bay Yaquina Bay and its watershed have multiple uses, including fishing, tourism, recreation, and research. As of 2014, the highest percentage of the Newport workforce is employed in management, business, science, and arts (36.7%), while only 8.9% are employed in natural resources, construction, and maintenance. Agriculture is a small percentage of the economy in Lincoln County, but has increased in the past ten years. While timber harvesting has been a historic contributor to the economy, this industry has since decreased. Employment had declined by 82% between about 1980 and 2000.  Fisheries and aquaculture  In 2015, Pacific Whiting, or North Pacific Hake, was the largest source of fish caught by commercial fisheries from Newport, OR, while Pink Shrimp brought in the greatest dollar amount.

Tourism represents a substantial contributor to the county economy, accounting for $133.8 million in industry income in 2012. Some tourist destinations include South Beach State Park, Yaquina Bay State Recreation Site, the Oregon Coast Aquarium, restaurants, shops, and attractions on the Bayfront, and Hatfield Marine Science Center.  Physical geography   Physical characteristics  Yaquina Bay jetties Yaquina Bay is a characteristic estuary, with freshwater input from the Yaquina River as well as open access to the Pacific Ocean introducing ocean saltwater. Yaquina Bay is maintained at 6.7 m (22 ft) deep with the help of dredging, but depth decreases upstream with the occurrence of shoals, tidal flats, and other shallow zones. The estuary is about 11.6 km2 at mean tide and can decrease to 9.1 km2 at mean low tide. The North and South Yaquina Jetties, at the junction between the Pacific Ocean and Yaquina Bay, were constructed in 1888. Predictions of tidal height and times are based on National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data with respect to Hatfield Marine Science Center's Center Dock.Hatfield Marine Science Center's Center Dock Yaquina Bay high and low tidal range is approximately 2.4 m (7.9 ft). Tidal flux is typically vigorous and allows intense mixing near the mouth of the Bay. However, there is seasonal variation on mixing within the estuary. During the summer and early months, June to October, the estuary is well-mixed contrasted to the winter months, November to May, when the estuary is more stratified. Due to the variation in tides and mixing, the salinity changes drastically depending on location within the Bay. Average salinity at the mouth of the Bay is 34 psu, whereas the salinity upriver is 0. The Yaquina River is 95 km (59 mi) long, beginning at the Central Oregon Coast Range, rounding past multiple bordered cities, and eventually opening up into Yaquina Bay. The river provides nutrients for the Bay and supports a variety of biology.  Sediments and deposition  Sediments that are found within Yaquina Bay are derived from tertiary rocks from the Central Oregon Coast Range, Pleistocene marine sediments and estuarine deposits. These sediments have three realms of deposition; marine deposition, fluviatile, and an intermediate transition state called marine-fluviatile. Marine deposition is found within the initial 2.4 km (1.5 mi) of the estuary and is associated with average ocean salinity and turbulent mixing. The sediment is similar in texture to sand and other fine grains. Fluviatile deposition extends from the point of freshwater input up to 9.7 km (6 mi) into the Bay, with its sediments more coarse. The transition stage between these two realms contains sediment mixes from the marine and fluviatile areas. The last recorded rate of sediment deposition was in 1936, with a recorded estimate of 23 cm (9.1 in) annually. However, deposition is subject to seasonal variations. Maximum deposition takes place in the winter and early spring when river runoff is highest due to increased rain, when the longshore drift is coming from the south, and when winds are from the southwest. In the summer, deposition is low because of lower runoff, southward longshore drift and northwest winds. Turbulent mixing within the estuary increases the amount of suspended sediment and therefore increases the turbidity within Yaquina Bay. Turbidity has been found to be most prominent when river runoff is low, typically during the summer. Chlorophyll concentrations and other measurements of water chemistry (see Chemistry section below) verify these observations.  Geology  Yaquina Bay was formed roughly 2.2 million years ago in the Oligocene Epoch of the Cenozoic Era. Increased sedimentation and subsidence contributed to formation of Yaquina Bay. Sedimentary rocks in this area are mainly \\"sandstone, siltstone and clay-containing mudstone\\", as indicated in geological samples from the sediments.Centala, Maxine. (2013). Geology of the Seal Rock Area. 89 pp. https://geologyofsealrock.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/final-geology-of-the- seal-rock-area2.pdf The oldest rocks found in the Coast Range and in Yaquina Bay date back to Paleocene and Eocene Epochs, about 40-60 million years ago. The seafloor to the west of Oregon is continually spreading and there is evidence of subduction taking place along the coast of Washington and Oregon.  Biology of Yaquina Bay  Yaquina Bay comprises several different habitats that provide resources for many species. These habitats include intertidal eelgrass beds, mudflats, and sandflats, and subtidal areas. Mudflats and sandflats are typically covered by water during high tide and exposed to air during low tide, while subtidal areas are covered by water almost all of the time.  Life in Yaquina Bay  Male California sea lions in Yaquina BayBeds of native eelgrass (Zostera marina) and beds of invasive eelgrass (Zostera japonica) grow separately and provide a distinct habitat for certain organisms. Birds, including gulls, ducks, shorebirds, crows, geese, egrets, rails, pelicans and cormorants are present in Yaquina Bay using the eelgrass and mudflats as habitats. Mud shrimp also live in mudflats, and they play an important role in nutrient cycling within the estuary. Burrows in the mud made by mud shrimp pump oxygen deeper into the sediment, which makes it available for microbes to use. Mud shrimp activity has also been shown to increase the movement of carbon and dissolved inorganic nitrogen in and out of the mud. Some species of diatoms, a type of phytoplankton, can be found on the sediments of Yaquina Bay wetlands. These diatoms are also important in nutrient cycling within the estuary. Another type of estuary habitat is formed by native Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida). These are historically abundant in Yaquina Bay, and in addition to creating hard surfaces in the estuary, oysters also filter the bay water and provide food for local people. In fact, settlement on the mouth of Yaquina Bay is attributed in part to the oyster fishery. In subtidal areas, marine mammals such as harbor seals and California sea lions are sometimes present in Yaquina Bay. Sea lions in the estuary are mostly male. They move through the estuary, but spend a lot of time near the Bayfront or hauled out on docks, perhaps due to the additional food or safety. Some fish species present in Yaquina Bay include English sole and sculpin, in addition to river lamprey, lingcod, anchovies, Pacific herring, sturgeon, flounder, and salmon. Clams and Dungeness crabs are also present within the bay and make up a resource for recreational fishers.  The estuary as a nursery  Yaquina Bay has been shown to be a site for spawning and development of many species. Pacific Herring and bay goby larvae are abundant, but other larval fishes such as sculpin, anchovy, smelt, clingfishes, cod, stickleback, pipefish, prickleback, gunnels, sandlance, rockfish, greenlings, lumpfish, and flounder are present in the estuary. Although there are larval fish present in the estuary, the Pacific herring was found to be the only commercial species that relies on the estuary for spawning and development. Yaquina Bay also provides a nursery environment for English sole. Multiple species of juvenile salmon, including chum, coho, and chinook, also pass through Yaquina Bay during their life cycle, often transitioning from shallower to deeper waters as they grow.  Chemistry of Yaquina Bay  The Yaquina Bay estuarine chemistry is influenced by daily tides, river sediment input, summer upwelling along the coast, and biological processes.  Tides  Yaquina Bay experiences mixed semidiurnal tides, ranging from 1.9-2.5 m (6.2-8.2 ft) daily.National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. (2012). Tide Tables 2012- West Coast of North and South America Including the Hawaiian Islands. 400 pp. The influx of water from the ocean changes the salinity of the estuary, creating a salt intrusion that has been estimated to reach as far as 21.8 km (13.5 mi) upriver. Daily tidal changes affect estuary mixing and stratification. Flood tides coming from the ocean bring coastal nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus into the estuary. During mixing events, the Yaquina Bay estuary experiences changes in gradients for salinity, concentration of chemical species, and suspended sediment, which in turn influences biological productivity. The Yaquina Bay estuary has high primary productivity throughout the year due to high dissolved oxygen concentrations and cool water temperature from tidal flushing.  Nutrients   Silicon  Sediment input from the Yaquina River contributes to the Yaquina Bay estuary chemistry, varying with seasonal rainfall. In the winter when there is higher rainfall and therefore more input from the River, siliceous diatoms are more abundant and have higher species diversity. This is contrasted with fewer diatom species in seasons when there is less rainfall. Rocks are mostly made of silica and when land weathering takes place, rocks are broken down into their smaller silica components. With increased rainfall and sediment transport, this weathering provides a source of silica for diatoms in Yaquina Bay. In general, the upstream Yaquina River source material is more quartz dominated (more silica) than downstream source material. Some of the heavy minerals upstream include micas (biotite and muscovite made of potassium, aluminum, and silica), hematite (iron), and limonite (iron oxides).Folger, D.W. (1972). Characteristics of Estuarine Sediments of The United States. Geological Survey Professional Paper 742. Washington, D.C.:United States Government Printing Office. 101 pp. http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0742/report.pdf Near the coastal shoreline and mouth of the Yaquina Bay estuary, the sand grains are mostly feldspars and chert (silica), and volcanic fragments (most likely high in silica, potassium, aluminum, sodium, and calcium). In nearshore marine deposit sediment, the source material is less quartz (less silica) compared to upriver sources; heavy minerals include pyroxene (a group of silicate minerals), hypersthene (magnesium iron silica), and diopside (magnesium calcium silica).  Carbon  Organic carbon concentrations of the Yaquina Bay estuary vary depending on depth. Concentrations are lowest in the channel (<0.2%) and highest in shallower sediments, particularly from samples collected at tidal flats (2.7%). About 1-7% of sand in the Yaquina Bay estuary is made of carbonates like mollusk shell fragments and foraminfera. Carbonate concentrations are higher in the bay channel (5%) and decrease towards the bay margin (3%).  Nitrogen  Major nitrogen sources for the Yaquina Bay estuary change with season. During drier seasons, the ocean is the major nitrogen source while the river is the major source in wetter seasons, where river discharge can be up to five times higher than drier seasons. Samples taken at the surface with varying salinities showed dissolved inorganic nitrogen is found mostly at the two salinity extremes; the mouth of the estuary and up the Yaquina River. The input at the mouth of Yaquina Bay indicates input from upwelled waters during the summer season. The nutrient flux into the estuary is enough to sustain primary productivity during the summer months.  Phosphorus  Phosphorus is generally a limiting nutrient in the ocean. In Pacific Northwest estuaries, an important source of phosphorus comes from ocean upwelling in the summer (see below). Samples taken at the surface with varying salinities showed dissolved inorganic phosphorus more prevalent in areas with higher salinities compared to lower, thus indicating the ocean as the source for this system.  Oxygen  Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration is an important water quality parameter because of its close relationship with biological activity. In the Yaquina Bay estuary, DO levels may be lower and almost hypoxic due to low DO levels with coastal upwelled water imported into the estuary. DO levels of imported ocean water are dependent on physical factors (wind stress and cool water temperature) and biological factors (association with chlorophyll a and respiration). Ocean influence of DO levels in the estuary extends to about 10 km (6.2 mi) upriver. In the upper estuary beyond ocean influence, DO levels decrease with increasing temperature.  Chlorophyll a  Upwelling along the western coast Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations vary seasonally with ocean water import, particularly during summer upwelling. Variation of Chl a also depends on the timing of summer upwelling each year, where upwelling could occur earlier or be delayed.Steve Pierce upwelling data http://damp.coas.oregonstate.edu/windstress/ Oregon estuaries typically have low median Chl a levels, about less than 5 micrograms per liter of water. When high concentrations of Chl a are advected into the estuary, there is also an increase in flood tide DO levels.  Upwelling  Summer upwelling along the Oregon coast brings nutrients from deep waters up into the Yaquina Bay estuary. This event, along with decreased rain and river input, and increased light, all contribute to the seasonal chemistry variability in the Bay.  Environmental concerns   Coastal hazards of Yaquina Bay  As with any coastal zone, there are inherent hazards present. Especially in the Pacific Northwest, coastlines are impacted by large waves, storm surge, strong currents, wind, and rain. Yaquina Bay is seasonally affected by these impacts, with winter typically the most intense period. Storms and rain increase, which leads to more land runoff and also causes waves and currents to reshape the coastline. Erosion is a problem not only for the Yaquina Bay, but for the entire Oregon Coast. Yaquina Bay's sediments are made up of sandstone, siltstone and clay-containing mudstone and these soft sediments contribute to the annual erosion rates. Waves, however, are the main proponent of erosion. Waves are parallel to the beach and as wind increases, energy is enhanced and height grows, causing a devastating effect on beaches. Also, as currents run along the coast, they move sand causing either addition or depletion of sand in some areas. This has been particularly evident around the Yaquina Jetty. With longshore drift increased during the winter, sand is deposited and dramatically built up in this area. In 2002, researchers, stakeholders, and policy makers organized a vulnerability assessment to assess the current state of the coast in respect to future hazards occurring. They included Yaquina Bay in their case study, as this area is heavily influenced by tourism, businesses, industries, vessels, to name a few. The assessment was able to address areas of concern and helped businesses and industries by highlighting ways to adapt to the changing conditions to prevent future damage.

It ended with the enactment of the Current Portuguese Constitution in 1976.  Background: the Salazar-Caetano era  The republic was replaced by a military dictatorship that promised order, authority, and discipline. The military regime abolished political parties, took steps against the small but vocal Marxist groups, and did away with republican institutions. In 1928 it invited University of Coimbra professor Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar to serve as minister of finance. In 1932 he became Prime Minister. That year marked the beginning of his regime, the New State (Estado Novo). Under Salazar (1932‚Äì68), Portugal became, at least formally, a corporative state. The new Constitution of 1933 embodied the corporatist theory, under which government was to be formed of economic entities organized according to their function, rather than by individual representation. Employers were to form one group, labor another, and they and other groups were to deal with one another through their representative organizations. In reality, however, Salazar headed an autocratic dictatorship with the help of an efficient secret police ‚Äì the PIDE. Strict censorship was introduced, the politically suspect were monitored, and the regime's opponents were jailed, sent into exile, and occasionally killed. Portugal drifted and floundered under this repressive regime for several decades. Economic conditions improved slightly in the 1950s, when Salazar instituted the first of two five-year economic plans. These plans stimulated some growth, and living standards began to rise.  1960s and the Colonial War  The 1960s, however, were crisis years for Portugal. Guerrilla movements emerged in the Portuguese African overseas territories of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea that aimed at liberating those territories from \\"the last colonial empire\\". Fighting three guerrilla movements for more than a decade proved to be enormously draining for a small, poor country in terms of labour and financial resources. At the same time, social changes brought about by urbanization, emigration, the growth of the working class, and the emergence of a sizeable middle class put new pressures on the political system to liberalize. Instead, Salazar increased repression, and the regime became even more rigid and ossified.  Salazar incapacitated  When Salazar was incapacitated in an accident in 1968, the Council of State, a high-level advisory body created by the Constitution of 1933, chose Marcello Caetano to succeed him. Caetano (1968‚Äì74), though a Salazar prot√©g√©, tried to modernize and liberalize the old Salazar system. He was opposed, however, by a group widely referred to as \\"the bunker,\\" the old Salazarists. These included the country's president, Admiral Am√©rico Tom√°s, the senior officers of the armed forces, and the heads of some of the country's largest financial groups. The bunker was powerful enough that any fundamental change would certainly have led to Caetano's immediate overthrow. As Caetano promised reform but fell into indecision, the sense began to grow among all groups‚Äîthe armed forces, the opposition and liberals within the regime‚Äîthat only a revolution could produce the changes that they felt Portugal sorely needed. Contributing to this feeling were a number of growing tensions on the political and social scene.  Economic pressure  The continuing economic drain caused by the military campaigns in Africa was exacerbated by the first great oil \\"shock\\" of 1973. Politically, the desire for democracy, or at least a greater opening up of the political system, was increasing. Social tensions mounted, as well, because of the slow pace of change and the absence of opportunities for advancement. The decisive ingredient in these tensions was dissension within the military itself, long a bulwark of the regime. Younger military academy graduates resented a program introduced by Caetano whereby militia officers who completed a brief training program and had served in the overseas territories' defensive campaigns, could be commissioned at the same rank as military academy graduates. Caetano's government had begun the program (which included several other reforms) in order to increase the number of officials employed against the African insurgencies, and at the same time cut down military costs to alleviate an already overburdened government budget. Sp√≠nola and revolution A key catalytic event in the process toward revolution was the publication, in 1973, of General Ant√≥nio de Sp√≠nola's book, Portugal and the Future, which criticized the conduct of the war and offered a far-ranging program for Portugal's recovery. The general's work sent shock waves through the political establishment in Lisbon. As the first major and public challenge to the regime by a high-ranking figure from within the system, Sp√≠nola's experience in the African campaigns gave his opinions added weight. The book was widely seen‚Äîa correct assessment as it turned out‚Äîas the opening salvo in Sp√≠nola's ambitious campaign to become president.  1974 uprising  On 25 April 1974, a group of younger officers belonging to an underground organization, the Armed Forces Movement (Movimento das For√ßas Armadas ‚Äì MFA), overthrew the Caetano regime, and Sp√≠nola emerged as at least the titular head of the new government. The uprising succeeded in hours with virtually no bloodshed. Caetano and other high-ranking officials of the old regime were arrested and exiled, many to Brazil. The military seized control of all important installations. Sp√≠nola regarded the military's action as a simple military uprising aimed at reorganizing the political structure with himself as the head, a \\"renova√ß√£o\\" (renovation), in his words. Within days, however, it became clear that the uprising had released long pent-up frustrations when thousands, and then tens of thousands of Portuguese poured into the streets celebrating the downfall of the regime and demanding further change. The coercive apparatus of the dictatorship‚Äîsecret police, Republican Guard, official party, censorship‚Äîwas overwhelmed and abolished. Workers began taking over shops from owners, peasants seized private lands, low-level employees took over hospitals from doctors and administrators, and government offices were occupied by workers who sacked the old management and demanded a thorough housecleaning. Very early on, the demonstrations began to be manipulated by organized political elements, principally the communists and other groups farther to the left. Radical labor and peasant leaders emerged from the underground where they had been operating for many years. M√°rio Soares, the leader of the Socialist Party of Portugal (Partido Socialista ‚Äì PS) and √Ålvaro Cunhal, head of the Portuguese Communist Party (Partido Comunista Portugu√™s ‚Äì PCP) returned from exile to Portugal within days of the revolt and received heroes' welcomes. Who actually ruled Portugal during this revolutionary period was not always clear, and various bodies vied for dominance. Sp√≠nola became the first interim president of the new regime in May 1974, and he chose the first of six provisional governments that were to govern the country until two years later when the first constitutional government was formed. Headed by a prime minister, the moderate civilian Adelino da Palma Carlos, the government consisted of the moderate Democratic People's Party (Partido Popular Democr√°tico ‚Äì PPD), the PS, the PCP, five independents, and one military officer. Beneath this formal structure, several other groups wielded considerable power. In the first weeks of the revolution, a key group was the National Salvation Junta (Junta de Salva√ß√£o Nacional), composed entirely of high-ranking, politically moderate military officers. Working alongside it was a seven-member coordinating committee made up of politically radical junior officers who had managed the uprising. By the end of May 1974, these two bodies worked together with other members in the Council of State, the nation's highest governing body. Gradually, however, the MFA emerged as the most powerful single group in Portugal as it overruled Sp√≠nola in several major decisions. Members of the MFA formed the Continental Operations Command (Comando Operacional do Continente ‚Äì COPCON) composed of 5,000 elite troops with Major (later Brigadier General) Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho as its commander. Known universally by his unusual first name Otelo, Carvalho had directed the 25 April uprising. Because the regular police withdrew from the public sector during the time of revolutionary turmoil and the military was somewhat divided, COPCON became the most important force for order in the country and was firmly under the control of radical left-wing officers. Sp√≠nola formed a second provisional government in mid-July with army Colonel (later General) Vasco Gon√ßalves as prime minister and eight military officers along with members of the PS, PCP, and PPD. Sp√≠nola chose Gon√ßalves because he was a moderate, but he was to move increasingly to the left as he headed four provisional governments between July 1974 and September 1975. Sp√≠nola's position further weakened when he was obliged to consent to the independence of Portugal's African colonies, rather than achieving the federal solution he had outlined in his book. Guinea-Bissau gained independence in early September, and talks were underway on the liberation of the other colonies. Sp√≠nola attempted to seize full power in late September but was blocked by COPCON and resigned from office. His replacement was the moderate General Francisco da Costa Gomes. Gon√ßalves formed a third provisional government with heavy MFA membership, nine military officers in all, and members of the PS, PCP, and PPD. In the next year, Portuguese politics moved steadily leftward. The PCP was highly successful in placing its members in many national and local political and administrative offices, and it was consolidating its hold on the country's labor unions. The MFA came ever more under the control of its radical wing, and some of its members came under the influence of the PCP. In addition, smaller, more radical left-wing groups joined with the PCP in staging huge demonstrations that brought about the increasing adoption of leftist policies, including nationalizations of private companies. An attempted uprising by Sp√≠nola in early March 1975 failed, and he fled the country. In response to this attack from the right, radical elements of the military abolished the Junta of National Salvation and formed the Council of the Revolution as the country's most powerful governing body. The council was made responsible to a 240-member radical military parliament, the Assembly of the Armed Forces. A fourth provisional government was formed, more radical than its predecessor, and was headed by Gon√ßalves, with eight military officers and members of the PS, PCP, PPD, and Portuguese Democratic Movement (Movimento Democr√°tico Portugu√™s ‚Äì MDP), a party close to the PCP. The new government began a wave of nationalizations of banks and large businesses. Because the banks were often holding companies, the government came after a time to own almost all the country's newspapers, insurance companies, hotels, construction companies and many other kinds of businesses, so that its share of the country's gross national product amounted to 70%.  The transition to civilian rule  Elections were held on April 25, 1975, for the Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution. The PS won nearly 38% the vote, while the PPD took 26.4%. The PCP, which opposed the elections because its leadership expected to do poorly, won less than 13% of the vote. A democratic right-wing party, the Democratic and Social Centre (Partido do Centro Democr√°tico e Social ‚Äì CDS), came in fourth with less than 8%. Despite the fact that the elections took place in a period of revolutionary ferment, most Portuguese voted for middle-class parties committed to pluralistic democracy. Many Portuguese regarded the elections as a sign that democracy was being effectively established. In addition, most members of the military welcomed the beginning of a transition to civilian democracy. Some elements of the MFA, however, had opposed the elections, agreeing to them only after working out an agreement with political parties that the MFA's policies would be carried out regardless of election results. Following the elections came the \\"hot summer\\" of 1975 when the revolution made itself felt in the countryside. Landless agricultural laborers in the south seized the large farms on which they worked. Many estates in the Alentejo were confiscated‚Äîover 10,000 square kilometres in all‚Äîand transformed into collective farms. In the north, where most farms were small and owned by those who worked them, such actions did not occur. The north's small farmers, conservative property-owners, violently repulsed the attempts of radical elements and the PCP to collectivize their land. Some farmers formed right-wing organizations in defense of private landownership, a reversal of the region's early welcoming of the revolution. Other revolutionary actions were met with hostility, as well. In mid-July, the PS and the PPD withdrew from the fourth provisional government to protest antidemocratic actions by radical military and leftist political forces. The PS newspaper Rep√∫blica had been closed by radical workers, causing a storm of protest both domestically and abroad. The PS and other democratic parties were also faced with a potentially lethal threat to the new freedom posed by the PCP's open contempt for parliamentary democracy and its dominance in Portugal's main trade union, Intersindical, or as it came to be known in 1977, the General Confederation of the Portuguese Workers‚ÄìNational Inter-Union (Confedera√ß√£o Geral dos Trabalhadores Portugueses ‚Äì Intersindical Nacional ‚Äì CGTP-IN). The United States and many West European countries expressed considerable alarm at the prospect of a Marxist-Leninist takeover in a NATO country. United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told PS leader Soares that he would probably be the \\"Alexander Kerensky of Portugal.\\" The result of these concerns was an influx of foreign financial aid into Portugal to shore up groups committed to pluralist parliamentary democracy. By the time of the \\"hot summer\\" of 1975, several currents could be seen within the MFA. A moderate group, the Group of Nine, issued a manifesto in August that advocated nonaligned socialism along the lines of Scandinavian social democracy. Another group published a manifesto that criticized both the Group of Nine and those who had drawn close to the PCP and singled out Prime Minister Gon√ßalves for his links to the communists. These differences of opinion signaled the end of the fifth provisional government, in power only a month, under Gon√ßalves in early September. Gon√ßalves was subsequently expelled from the Council of the Revolution as this body became more moderate. The sixth provisional government was formed, headed by Admiral Jos√© Baptista Pinheiro de Azevedo; it included the leader of the Group of Nine and members of the PS, the PPD, and PCP. This government, which was to remain in power until July 1976, when the first constitutional government was formed, was pledged to adhere to the policies advocated by MFA moderates. Evolving political stability did not reflect the country as a whole, which was on the verge of anarchy. Even the command structure of the military broke down. Political parties to the right of the PCP became more confident and increasingly fought for order, as did many in the military. The granting of independence to Mozambique in September 1975, and to Angola in November meant that the colonial wars were ended. The attainment of peace, the main aim of the military during all these months of political upheaval, was thus achieved, and the military could begin the transition to civilian rule. The polling results of the April 1975 constituent assembly elections legitimized the popular support given to the parties that could manage and welcome this transition. A coup by military units in November 1975 led by Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, referred to as the 25 of November, marked the decline of leftist influence in Portugal. On this day, under the pretense of a left-wing takeover of a radio station, Colonel Ant√≥nio dos Santos Ramalho Eanes declared a state of emergency and sent loyal commandos to seize the city of Lisbon. Revolutionary units within Lisbon were quickly surrounded and forced to surrender; about 200 leftists were arrested, and COPCON was abolished. The communists' ability to institute its goals had diminished without the support of the military, and people returned to their jobs and daily routines after eighteen months of political and social turmoil. A degree of compromise among competing political visions of how the new state should be organized was reached, and the country's new Constitution was proclaimed on 2 April 1976, paving the way to the termination of the provisional governments and of the Ongoing Revolutionary Process. Several weeks later, on 25 April, elections for the new Parliament, the Assembly of the Republic, were held. These elections could be said to be the definitive end of a period of revolution. Moderate democratic parties received most of the vote. Revolutionary achievements were not discarded, however. The constitution pledged the country to realize socialism. Furthermore, the constitution declared the extensive nationalizations and land seizures of 1975 irreversible. The military supported these commitments through a pact with the main political parties that guaranteed its guardian rights over the new democracy for four more years. Consolidation of democracy After the adoption of the country's new Constitution in 1976, the first elections for the Assembly of the Republic, were won by the PS. It took 36.7% of the vote, compared with the 25.2% for the PPD, 16.7% for the CDS, and 15.2% for the PCP. Elections for the presidency were held in June and won easily by General Ant√≥nio Ramalho Eanes, who enjoyed the backing of parties to the right of the communists: the PS, the PPD, and the CDS. Although the PS did not have a majority in the Assembly of the Republic, Eanes allowed it to form the first constitutional government with Soares as prime minister. It governed from 23 July 1976, to 30 January 1978. A second government, formed from a coalition with the CDS, lasted from January to August 1978 and was also led by Soares. The PS governments faced enormous economic and social problems such as runaway inflation, high unemployment, falling wages, and an enormous influx of Portuguese settlers from Africa. Failure to fix the economy, even after adopting a painful austerity program imposed by the International Monetary Fund, ultimately forced the PS to relinquish power. However, the PS could be seen as having been successful in that it governed Portugal democratically for two years and helped thereby to consolidate the new political system. After the collapse of the PS-CDS coalition government in July 1978, President Eanes formed a number of caretaker governments in the hope that they would rule until the parliamentary elections mandated by the constitution could be held in 1980. There were, therefore, three short-lived governments appointed by President Eanes. These were led by Prime Minister Alfredo Nobre da Costa from 28 August, to 21 November 1978; Carlos Mota Pinto from 21 November 1978, to 31 July 1979; and Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo (Portugal's first woman prime minister) from 31 July 1979, to 3 January 1980. The weakness of these governments and the failure of the PS and the PPD, now renamed the Social Democratic Party (Partido Social Democrata ‚Äì PSD), to form a coalition government forced President Eanes to call for interim elections to be held in December 1979. Francisco S√° Carneiro, the dynamic leader of the PSD and a fierce personal rival of Soares, put together a coalition of his own PSD along with the CDS, the People's Monarchist Party (Partido Popular Mon√°rquico ‚Äì PPM), and another small party to form the Democratic Alliance (Alian√ßa Democr√°tica ‚Äì AD). The AD downplayed its intentions to revise the constitution to reverse the nationalizations and land seizures of the mid-1970s and advocated a moderate economic policy. The coalition won 45.2% of the vote in the elections, or 128 seats, for a majority of 3 in the 250-seat assembly. The PS, which had also formed an electoral coalition with several small left-wing groups, suffered a drubbing and won only 27.4%, a large drop compared with 1976 results. The PCP, in coalition with another left-wing party, gained slightly. Francisco S√° Carneiro became prime minister in January 1980, and the tenor of parliamentary politics moved to the right as the government attempted to undo some of the revolution's radical reforms. The powers conferred on the presidency by the constitution of 1976 enabled President Eanes to block the AD's centrist economic policies. For this reason, the AD concentrated on winning enough seats in the October 1980 elections to reach a two-thirds majority to effect constitutional change and on electing someone other than Eanes in the presidential elections of December 1980. Portuguese voters approved of the movement to the right, and in the parliamentary elections the AD coalition increased the number of its seats to 134, while the PS held steady at 74 seats and the PCP lost 6 seats for a total of 41. The AD's win was not complete, however, because President Eanes was easily reelected in December. In contrast to the election of 1976, when Eanes was supported by the PS and parties to its right, he was backed in 1980 by the PS, the PCP, and other left-wing parties. Voters admired Eanes for his integrity and obvious devotion to democracy. His election, however, made constitutional change less certain because the AD did not have by itself the required two-thirds majority. The AD also suffered a serious loss when its dynamic leader, S√° Carneiro, died in a plane crash just two days before the presidential election. His successor was Francisco Pinto Balsem√£o, the founder and editor of the Expresso newspaper. The AD coalition remained in power until mid-1983, forming two governments with Balsem√£o as prime minister. In combination with the PS, which also desired fundamental changes in the political system, the AD was able to revise the constitution. Amendments were passed that enhanced the power of the prime minister and the Assembly of the Republic at the expense of the President. The role of the military in the running of the country was ended with the abolition of the Council of the Revolution. The Constitutional reform was promulgated in September 1982. The Council of the Revolution was replaced with two consultative bodies, linked to the office of the President. One of these, the Higher Council of National Defense, was limited to commenting on military matters. The other, the Council of State, was broadly representative of the entire country and did not have the power to prevent government and parliamentary actions by declaring them unconstitutional. The constitutional reform also created a Constitutional Court to review the constitutionality of legislation. Because ten of its thirteen judges were chosen by the Assembly of the Republic, it was under parliamentary control. Another important change reduced the president's power by restricting presidential ability to dismiss the government, dissolve parliament, or veto legislation. Also, the ideological tone of the Constitution was toned down, and several references to the goal of establishing a socialist order were softened or eliminated. Although the AD government had achieved its main objective of amending the constitution, the country's economic problems worsened, and the coalition gradually lost popular support. Balsem√£o also tired of the constant political skirmishing needed to hold the AD together and resigned in December 1982. Unable to choose a successor, the AD broke apart. Parliamentary elections in April 1983 gave the PS a stunning victory that increased its parliamentary seats to 101. After long negotiations, the PS joined with the PSD to form a governing coalition, the Central Bloc (Bloco Central), with Soares as prime minister. The Central Bloc government was fragile from its beginning and lasted only two years. Faced with serious and worsening economic problems, the government had to adopt an unpopular austerity policy. Administrative and personality difficulties made relations within the government tense and resulted in bitter parliamentary maneuvers. Overshadowing these difficulties was the upcoming presidential election in early 1986. Soares made clear his ambition to succeed Eanes, who, according to the constitution, was not allowed to seek a third consecutive term. A split within the PSD over its presidential candidate ended the coalition government in June 1985. In new assembly elections held in October 1985, the PS, blamed by the public for the country's severe economic problems, such as a 10% fall in wages since 1983, suffered serious losses and lost almost half its seats in the Assembly of the Republic. The PCP's electoral coalition lost six seats; the PSD won thirteen more seats because of new leadership; and the CDS lost almost a third of its seats. The big winner was a party formed by supporters of President Eanes, the Democratic Renewal Party (Partido Renovador Democr√°tico ‚Äì PRD), which, although only months old, won nearly 18% of the vote and forty-five seats. The party's victory stemmed from the high regard Portuguese voters had for President Eanes. No party emerged from the October 1985 elections with anything even close to an absolute majority. Hence, the 1985‚Äì87 period was unstable politically. The new head of the PSD, economist An√≠bal Cavaco Silva, as prime minister headed a minority PSD government that managed to survive for only seventeen months. Its success was attributed partly to support from the PRD, which as a young party wished to establish itself, although it was a motion of censure presented by this party in the spring of 1987 that eventually brought the government down. Cavaco Silva also benefited from the internal dissension of other parties. The presidential election of 1986 did not yield a winner in the first round. The candidate of the CDS and the PSD, Diogo Freitas do Amaral, won 46.3% of the vote compared with 25.4% for M√°rio Soares. Freitas do Amaral, candidate of a united right, profited from the left's mounting of three candidates. In the two-candidate runoff election in mid-February, Soares won with 51.3% of the vote, getting the support of most left-wing voters. The PCP supported him as the lesser of two evils, even though Soares repeatedly reminded voters that he, perhaps more than anyone else, had prevented the communists from coming to power in the mid-1970s. Cavaco Silva came to have full control of his party, the PSD. As prime minister, he pushed for a liberalization of the economy. He was fortunate in that external economic trends and the infusion of funds from the European Community after Portugal became a member in 1986 enlivened the country's economy and began to bring an unaccustomed prosperity to Portuguese wage earners. Confident therefore that his party could win in parliamentary elections, Cavaco Silva maneuvered his political opponents into passing a vote of censure against his government in April 1987. Instead of asking for a new government composed of a variety of parties on the left, President Soares called for early elections in July. Cavaco Silva had judged the political situation correctly. The PSD won just over 50% of the vote, which gave it an absolute majority in the parliament, the first single-party majority since the restoration of democracy in 1974. The strong mandate would enable Cavaco Silva to put forward a more clearly defined program and perhaps govern more effectively than his predecessors.

He currently works for TSN Radio 1040 in Vancouver. Early life Taylor is the youngest of four brothers and two sisters. Taylor graduated from Alpha Secondary School in 1977. Sports broadcasting Taylor was the longtime co-host of CKVU's nightly sports news show Sports Page from 1985 to 2000 and was also briefly a radio broadcaster with CKNW. He hosted Sportsnet Pacific's nightly sports news program Sportsnet Connected from 2001 up until August 8, 2014, when it was announced that Taylor would no longer work for Sportsnet. In 2003 he returned to the radio on what was then called the TEAM 1040, co-hosting the Pratt & Taylor Show. When David Pratt and the station management couldn't come to an agreement for a new contract in 2011, Pratt left the station and Taylor's long-time friend and former CKVU co-worker, Barry Macdonald, became Pratt's replacement for the afternoon show. It would be known as the BMac & Taylor Show until 2015, when Bob \\"The Moj\\" Marjanovich was added to the show, which currently is called the BMac, Donnie and the Moj Show, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on TSN 1040. During his nearly three decades on television, Taylor was known for his canned delivery of the nightly sports highlights, which consisted largely of a set of recurring themes including: # Referring to obscure players or players with unusual names. For example, Taylor might refer to Brad Isbister as \\"The Isbisterian One\\". ## Similarly, Taylor might refer to a play by the same player as having been performed \\"in Isbisterian fashion.\\" ## Taylor also facetiously inflates the esteem of groups of lesser-known players. For example, a line of players named Adams, Barrett, and Carnegie might be referred to as the \\"dreaded Adams-Barrett-Carnegie line\\" when they score a goal. # Describing the colours of either the home or visiting teams jerseys in unusual levels of detail.

Accessed February 13, 2011. \\"Oliver was a nephew of General Gage's wife, the former Margaret Kemble, from East Brunswick, New Jersey, who adapted to British ways while clinging to her American identity.\\" She died in England in 1824. Mrs. Gage was a gateway ancestor to centuries of English nobility who have Dutch and Huguenot ancestry from what was once New Netherlands and later the Thirteen Colonies of British North America. Family life and descendants Margaret Kemble was the daughter of Peter Kemble, a well-to-do New Jersey businessman and politician, and of Gertrude Bayard; thus the granddaughter of Judge Samuel Bayard (b. 1669) and Margaretta van Cortlandt (b. 1674); hence the great-granddaughter of Mayor of New York City Stephanus Van Cortlandt and Gertrude Schuyler. She married Thomas Gage on December 8, 1758, at her father's 1200-acre Mount Kemble Plantation in New Jersey (where years later generals William Smallwood and Anthony Wayne were quartered in his modest wood-framed mansion,Glen Alpin: A Brief History , The Glen Alpin Conservancy, accessed June 2017. while the Continental Army encamped at Jockey Hollow during the brutal winter of 1779‚Äì80).Morristown National Historical Park: The Great Story, accessed June 2017 Together they had eleven children. Their first son, the future 3rd Viscount Gage, was born in 1761. Gage's daughter, Charlotte Margaret Gage, married Admiral Sir Charles Ogle. Descendants of Kemble Gage include: * Lieutenant General Sir John Paul Foley (1939) retired British general * Henry Hodgetts-Foley (1828‚Äì1894) former member of Parliament * Montagu Bertie, 6th Earl of Abingdon (1808‚Äì1884) British peer and politician * John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort (1886‚Äì1946) British military officer and Commander of the British Expeditionary Forces in Europe during World War Two up to the Battle of Dunkirk. * Gabriella Wilde (1989‚Äì) British model and actress Her brother, Stephen Kemble, was a lieutenant-colonel in the British Army during the Revolution. She was portrayed by Emily Berrington in the television miniseries Sons of Liberty. Role in American Revolution Some historians feel that Margaret Kemble Gage may have been instrumental in causing the first shots to be fired in the American Revolution (the Battle of Lexington and Concord).Fischer, David Hackett. Paul Revere's Ride, pp. 95‚Äì97, Oxford University Press, New York, New York, 1994.Nelson, James L. With Fire & Sword: The Battle of Bunker Hill and the Beginning of the American Revolution, p. 27, Thomas Dunne Books, New York, New York, 2011. In the days leading up to the battle, the Sons of Liberty could see that the British troops in Boston were preparing for something. Dr. Joseph Warren, one of the key leaders of the Sons of Liberty, had a confidential informer, who was well-connected to the British high command. He could only use this informer for the most important matters, and this seemed like the time. The secret informant provided \\"intelligence of their whole design\\" \\"to arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who were known to be at Lexington, and burn the colonists' military stores at Concord.\\"Borneman, Walter R. American Spring: Lexington, Concord, and the Road to Revolution, pp. 127‚Äì9, Little, Brown & Company, New York, New York, 2015. Gen. Gage had hoped to prevent a war. He had planned a secret night march, hoping to scoop up Adams and Hancock, as well as the colonial powder and cannon, while the colonists slept. Instead, Warren, after learning of the plan, dispatched Paul Revere and William Dawes, who set off a chain reaction of alarm riders all across Massachusetts and even to adjoining colonies. Instead of a quiet night mission, the British troops found themselves opposed by thousands of wide-awake, angry, armed colonists. By the end of the day, the British troops were being shot at from all directions by a revolving swarm of irate patriots. If Gage had not later sent out an additional 1,000 reinforcements, with cannon, the original British force of 700 would have never made it back to Boston. It is not known who Warren's secret source was. He kept his secret, and was killed two months later at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The evidence is slim and circumstantial, but many historians feel that the leading suspect is Margaret Kemble Gage.Nelson, James L. With Fire and Sword: The Battle of Bunker Hill and the Beginning of the American Revolution, pp. 27, 62, 93‚Äì94, Thomas Dunne Books, New York, New York, 2011.Putnam Foundation. Timken Museum of Art: European Works of Art, American Paintings and Russian Icons in the Putnam Foundation Collection, pp. 182‚Äì5, San Diego, California, 1996. She was an American, and came from a very prestigious, wealthy family. Her social standing was equal to that of her husband. Gen. Gage's officers called her \\"Dutchess\\". She did not make a secret of her divided loyalties, and said that \\"she hoped her husband would never be the instrument of sacrificing the lives of her countrymen\\".Philbrick, Nathaniel. Bunker Hill: A City, a Siege, a Revolution, pp. 87, 117, 234‚Äì5, Viking Press, 2013.Barratt, Carrie Rebora. John Singleton Copley and Margaret Kemble Gage, pp. 6, 8, Putnam Foundation, San Diego, California, 1998. Gen. Gage stated that he had only told two people of the plan, which was to be kept a \\"profound secret\\": his second-in-command, and one other person. Some of the other top British officers suspected that that other person was Gen. Gage's wife. Prior to this, Gen. Gage had been devoted to his wife, but after the unexpected engagements at Lexington and Concord, he ordered her away from him, and put her on a ship back to England.

It has 180 members, elected for five-year terms in 49 single and multi-seat constituencies. Although multiparty elections have been held since 1992, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (RDPC), the ruling party since independence, has always retained control of the National Assembly. The Cameroonian political system invests overwhelming power in the hands of the President of the Republic, Paul Biya, and the RDPC exists essentially to support Biya and his policies. As a result, for most of Cameroon's history since independence, the National Assembly has done little more than approve the President's policies. From 1992 to 1997, the RDPC relied on alliances with two smaller parties to secure a parliamentary majority. This has been the only period since independence that saw any meaningful opposition to presidential decisions. Beginning in 1997, the RDPC has won an outright majority in each election; its majorities have consistently improved as the opposition has weakened. Prior to 2013 and the creation of the Senate, the National Assembly was a unicameral chamber. 2008 constitutional changes On 10 April 2008, the National Assembly overwhelmingly voted a bill to change the Constitution of Cameroon to provide the President of the Republic with immunity from prosecution for official acts and to allow him to run for an unlimited number of seven-year terms (it was previously limited to two terms) along with a number of other changes. The changes took place after a walk-out of the National Assembly by the opposition SDF representatives and just one month after widespread violence resulting in dozens of deaths and hundreds of arrests protesting price rises and the proposed constitutional changes. Five members of parliament voted against the bill. Opposition lawmakers and at least one deputy from the ruling RDPC, Paul Abine Ayah, criticised the bill as a setback for democracy and the country in general.

It was published in the collection Dancing Girls & Other Stories in 1977. Plot summary Sarah and Edward are on a vacation in Mexico, and are visiting uninteresting tourist locations. They are married, but do not get along well. Sarah describes Edward's passions (such as birdwatching) as \\"compulsions\\" which are \\"awkward and boyish\\". They merely make her tired. She is \\"bland and pale and plump and smug\\". Things were once different between them, but Sarah's child is stillborn, and they have become increasingly uninterested in each other since. Their discrepancies multiply. While visiting a restaurant, Sarah steals a toy figure of baby Jesus, and later throws it into a sacrificial well that they visit on a tour. Edward sees this, thinking Sarah is about to jump in the well but is hesitant to approach her. Both Sarah and Edward had previously dreamed of life without each other, making the decision to stop Sarah from \\"jumping in the well\\" even more difficult. Edward sees that it was just the toy being thrown in, and attempts to comfort Sarah as she breaks down in tears. The two cannot truly connect or comfort each other, as they no longer understand each other; or maybe never did. Their marriage is still broken, and neither Sarah nor Edward are happy yet.

Clark, pp177-183, Scars on the Landscape. A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803-1859, Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 In 1863 Hagenauer established Ramahyuck Mission on the banks of the Avon River near Lake Wellington to house the members of the Gunai people who survived massacres and attacks in west and central Gippsland. The name combines \\"Ramah\\", the home of Samuel in the First Book of Kings, with \\"yuck\\", an Aboriginal term reputedly meaning \\"our place\\". The mission sought to discourage all tribal ritual and culture, and replace it with Christian values and European customs. The Mission closed in 1908 and the few remaining residents were moved to Lake Tyers Mission. He played a significant role in lobbying the Board for the Protection of Aborigines (BPA) to introduce the nicknamed 'Half Caste Act' which forced Aboriginal people under 34 years of age with non-Aboriginal parentage to leave missions. This created much distress for Aboriginal people as outlined in letters written to the BPA which document requests for permission to visit family left on missions and for provision of basic needs from people struggling to survive in a racist settler society.J.

Hagenauer appears to have encouraged her to come to his mission to teach but the covert plan was for her to marry one of his star converts. Bessie's parents were both aboriginals whereas Hagenauer's convert and her husband designate, Adolph Donald Cameron, was a half caste. They married when Bessie was 17 and they had eight children.

Origin Some Jain Bunts are hereditary trustees and administrators of Hindu Temples, an example being at the Dharmasthala Temple, whose hereditary administrators are the Pergade family. Tradition Achieving moksha or liberation is the highest goal of life for the Jains. Jain monastics and renouncers of worldly life are highly revered, especially Bahubali, a king who turned into an ascetic. His virtues are greatly extolled in legends. Huge, monolithic statues have been erected by the Jain Bunts in his honor throughout their recorded history.P. Gururaja Bhatt, Antiquities of South Kanara, Prabhakara Press, 1969, 31 pages. The oldest among them is located in Karkala. Standing about 42 feet tall, it was erected by the Jain Bunt as per the wishes of a pontiff named Lalitakeerti in 1432. Another statue of Bahubali standing about 35 feet was erected in Venur in 1604 by the Jain Bunt ruler Timma Ajila. The most recently erected statue lies in Dharmasthala and is about 39 feet tall.

According to the IPU, the National Assembly has 150 indirectly elected members. The National Assembly was composed in February 1992. The meeting place of the National Assembly is located in Asmara. AFP reported that Eritreans have elected 399 representatives in the country's six regions in a lengthy process that will lead to the formation of a constituent assembly. The regional elections began on 4 January 1997 in some parts of the country and were completed in others by 1 March 1997. Direct elections have never been held; planned elections have been continuously postponed since 2001. The National Assembly has never met since 2002; President Isaias Afwerki now exercises legislative functions in addition to the executive functions granted by the constitution. Background While Eritrea was federated to Ethiopia, and later annexed from 1952‚Äì1962, the Eritrean Assembly was the legislative body. Eritrea has a one party national Assembly governed by People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) (originally the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF)). From the time of independence since May 1991, the country has been continuing with a transitional government elected during the elections in June 1993. The scheduled elections in 2001 has been postponed indefinitely. The regional and local elections are conducted on a periodic basis on a restricted framework. All men and women of any ethnic or religious background are eligible to vote. Only individuals, not parties, are allowed to contest and the elections are presided by representatives from PDFJ. Policy decisions should be centered around the party mandate and opposition and dissenters have been imprisoned. Qualification The composition of the 150 members of the National Assembly is members from the Central Committee members of the ruling PFDJ and 75 others elected from the 527 member Constituent Assembly in 1997. The elections were held for a transitional government to discuss and ratify the new constitution. The stipulation set for the 75 elected members were: a minimum of 11 women members and minimum of 15 members representing expat Eritreans. Constitutional powers The President is elected by the members of the National Assembly for a five-year term and a maximum of two terms. The members of the National Assembly are elected directly by popular vote. In May 1997, a new constitution was adopted, which enabled only the 75 elected members needed in the Assembly, while 75 others from the PFDJ were nominated from Central Committee. The members of the transitional assembly were allowed to continue until next elections were held. The National Assembly is scheduled to meet every six months or at points of emergency at the behest of President and two- thirds of the members. The Council of State reports to the Assembly. Assembly is set as the top most legislative body of the Constitution of Eritrea that needs to assure the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country and to ensure justice, peace and stability. The National Assembly was also set to oversee the Executive branch of the constitution during the regime of the transitional government. The other major functions of the National Assembly include approval of budgets, governing domestic and foreign policies, and regulating the policies of the council.

He was the former safeties coach for the Green Bay Packers. A product of Penn State, Perry played free safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers, San Diego Chargers and New Orleans Saints. Playing career High school As a quarterback at Chesapeake, Virginia's Deep Creek High School, Perry passed for 24 touchdowns and 2,790 yards. College Perry was named a first-team Football Writers All-American in 1991 and graduated as Penn State's second leading all-time interceptor with 15. Perry's 299 interception return yards and three interceptions for touchdowns are school records. Perry had six interceptions his senior year and returned two for touchdowns. Perry appeared on the cover of the November 26, 1990 issue of Sports Illustrated following Penn State‚Äôs defeat of then #1, Notre Dame. He has a sandwich named in his honor at State College, Pennsylvania's Fraser Street Deli. The ingredients are Roast Beef, Provolone, and Onions all heated and served on toasted bread. Professional An eighth round draft pick (203rd overall) of the 1992 NFL Draft, (the first for Steelers head coach Bill Cowher), Perry played seven seasons (1992‚Äì98) with the Steelers and started the first 110 games of his career, including the postseason. Largely unheralded, the 5'11\\", . rookie picked off six passes, becoming the first rookie since 1955 to lead the team in interceptions. The pairing of Perry with Pro Bowler Rod Woodson in the secondary helped create one of the NFL's most effective and durable secondaries. His 32 career interceptions from 1992-98 are tied for seventh in Pittsburgh history. Perry signed with the San Diego Chargers in 1999 and rounded out his playing career in 2000 with the New Orleans Saints, having played in 139 of 141 possible games, missing only two games in 1997 due to a groin injury. He started 13 postseason games, including Super Bowl XXX. He had a career total of 35 interceptions. In 1997, Perry was selected as the recipient of the Pro Football Writers' \\"Chief Award,\\" presented annually to the member of the Steelers‚Äô organization who best exemplifies the spirit of cooperation with the media. He was also named the winner of the 1992 \\"Joe Greene Great Performance Award,\\" given to the outstanding Steelers rookie. Coaching Perry spent the 2002 season as the Cincinnati Bengals' safeties coach under his former defensive coordinator, Dick Lebeau. He was the Steelers' defensive backs coach from 2004‚Äì2006, after having served as assistant defensive backs coach in 2003. Perry was instrumental with the rapid development of the Steelers‚Äô two outstanding safeties, All-Pro Troy Polamalu and Chris Hope. He resigned from the Steelers coaching staff on January 25, 2007, following the retirement of head coach Bill Cowher. Perry was hired by the Oakland Raiders as their defensive backs coach on February 5, 2007, and spent two seasons with the team. Perry was hired by the Green Bay Packers as their safeties coach on February 3, 2009. On January 29, 2018 Mike McCarthy announced in a press release Perry would not be returning to the Packers and would be seeking to pursue other coaching opportunities.https://twitter.com/ByRyanWood/status/958102110498799616 Personal life In 1992, he began Intercept for Care, wherein Perry made a $500 donation to Chesapeake Care for every interception he made. Chesapeake Care is a program in which doctors, nurses, dentists and volunteers donate services to those without medical insurance in Chesapeake, Virginia. Perry later convinced others to match his contribution, making each of his interceptions worth as much as $2,500 apiece. By 1996 the program had helped over 9,000 patients. Perry and his wife Errika have four children: Danielle, Dominique, Dedriana and Devan. They live in Chesapeake, Virginia in the offseason. In 2007, Perry, along with fellow Penn Stater and ex-Buffalo Bill Keith Goganious, collaborated in to resurrect the Hampton Roads Football Camp after a 12-year hiatus. The camp, held at Virginia Wesleyan College is aimed at high school athletes. New York Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress was a past attendee. In December 2016 Darren was arrested for drunk driving in Green Bay, Wisconsin. At the time of his arrest he also refused to take an alcohol test. He has pleaded not guilty and has court for a final pre-trial conference on March 30, 2017.http://fox11online.com/sports/packers-and-nfl/packers-asst- coach-pleads-not-guilty-in-owi-citation-case References External links *Green Bay Packers coaching bio *Oakland Raiders coaching bio *The Virginia- Pilot, January 27, 1996 *The Virginia-Pilot, January 14, 1995 Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Players of American football from Virginia Category:Sportspeople from Chesapeake, Virginia Category:American football safeties Category:Penn State Nittany Lions football players Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:New Orleans Saints players Category:Pittsburgh Steelers coaches Category:Cincinnati Bengals coaches Category:Oakland Raiders coaches Category:Green Bay Packers coaches ","title":"Darren Perry"},{"id":"4497504","text":"The Canadian Teachers' Federation (CTF/FCE) is a bilingual not-for-profit organization and a national alliance of provincial and territorial teacher organizations representing more than 277,000 members throughout Canada.

It was written by David Chase, directed by Dan Attias and was originally broadcast on January 17, 1999, in the United States. Starring * James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano * Lorraine Bracco as Dr. Jennifer Melfi * Edie Falco as Carmela Soprano * Michael Imperioli as Christopher Moltisanti * Dominic Chianese as Corrado Soprano, Jr. * Vincent Pastore as Pussy Bonpensiero * Steven Van Zandt as Silvio Dante * Tony Sirico as Paulie Gualtieri * Robert Iler as Anthony Soprano, Jr. * Jamie-Lynn Sigler as Meadow Soprano * Nancy Marchand as Livia Soprano Guest starring * Michael Rispoli as Jackie Aprile, Sr. Also guest starring Synopsis Carmela feels sorry for A.J's science teacher, whose car has been stolen, and persuades Tony to help. Tony tells Big Pussy Bonpensiero, a member of his crew who runs an auto repair shop, to look out for the vehicle, a task Pussy resents. The thieves are found, but the car has been \\"chopped\\" so they are told to steal another one. The teacher is somewhat surprised when his car is returned with the same plates, but different keys and a different color. Christopher and Brendan Filone, who has a meth habit, hijack a shipment of DVD players. They deliver the goods to Tony, Silvio and Paulie \\"Walnuts\\" Gualtieri at Sil's strip club, the Bada Bing. However, the truck company pays protection money to Junior, who angrily arranges a sit-down with Tony and the DiMeo family's acting boss, Jackie Aprile, Sr. Jackie has cancer and is thinking of naming a successor. He rules that restitution must be made, which Tony accepts, but Chris, who thinks he is due his button, attempts to reject the $15,000 that Junior claims. Tony insists on receiving the full amount from Chris, saying he will beat Junior down; but Chris can tell that Tony will take some for himself, and little will be left for him and Brendan. Although they have been told not to attack the truck company again, Brendan and Chris, both high on meth, next plan to hijack a shipment of Italian suits. However, when Brendan arrives to pick up his partner, a stoned and reflective Chris decides to sit the job out. Brendan proceeds with the hijacking along with two associates, both nervous. One of them drops his gun; it fires when it hits the ground, killing the driver. The two of them flee in panic. When Tony learns of this, he orders Chris and Brendan to return the whole consignment to Junior and come to terms with him, though first his crew help themselves to a few of the suits. A small fire occurs when Livia is cooking. Tony insists that she accept a live-in nurse, but Livia soon enrages her and she walks out. Tony is proud that his mother still drives, but she forgets to switch the vehicle into reverse and badly injures a friend of hers to whom she has just given a lift. Livia now has to go, very reluctantly, into the Green Grove retirement community. In her almost empty house, collecting old photos of himself as a child with his parents, Tony nearly has another panic attack. Although Tony himself tells his mother, \\"You've got to stop with this black poison cloud, because I can't take it any more,\\" he cannot bear hard words about her from Dr. Melfi. Melfi says that Livia has \\"great difficulty maintaining a relationship with anyone\\"; Tony speaks of his guilt. She says that he must either acknowledge or displace his \\"feelings of hatred\\" and anger against his mother; he walks out. In the Bada Bing, when the bartender Georgie Santorelli clumsily uses the telephone in a manner similar to Livia, Tony grabs the handset and bashes him with it, displacing his anger. First appearances * Brendan Filone: Christopher's crystal meth-addled friend and partner in crime. He is rather reckless but he is well aware of Tony's power and hopes to somehow move up in the ranks alongside Christopher. * Jackie Aprile, Sr.: Acting boss of DiMeo crime family. He meets Tony and Uncle Junior at Satriale's to discuss his cancer and his current position. * Georgie Santorelli: Barman at the Bada Bing whose ineptitude with the telephone upsets Tony. * Mikey Palmice: soldier in Junior Soprano crew who serves as his chauffeur and hitman, whom Tony dislikes intensely. Deceased * Hector Anthony: killed accidentally when one of Brendan Filone's goons, Special K dropped his gun during a truck hijacking. Title reference 46-Long is a large man's suit size. Silvio, Pussy, etc all try on the Italian suits Christopher and Brendan hijacked.  Cultural references * Silvio makes several impressions of Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part III. * Silvio and Pussy mention Princess Diana. * Tony says that the Mayor of New York is the person \\"least likely to be cloned\\". The mayor at the time was Rudy Giuliani. * When Pussy informs Paulie that he got the thieves‚Äô address, he refers to them as \\"these Spice Girls\\", a reference to the British girl group, since the perpetrators Eduardo and Jerome are a gay couple (the former being Hispanic). * When Pussy and Paulie confront the guys who stole the science teacher's car, \\"Big Pussy\\" references criminal defense attorney Johnnie Cochran. * When Brendan and his two associates are hijacking the truck and Special K gets into the truck, there is a remark that \\"You couldn't drive a Fisher-Price\\"‚Äîa reference to the toy manufacturer. * When Brendan and Christopher meet with Tony at Satriale's, Brendan insults Jackie by referring to him as KemoSabe, a reference to Tonto's name for the Lone Ranger and a pun on the fact that Jackie is receiving chemotherapy. *When Brendan, Christopher and Adrianna are in line waiting to get into the night club, Martin Scorsese (played by Tony Caso) arrives in a limo and goes into the club. * While investigating A.J.'s teacher's missing car, Big Pussy comments that he is \\"fuckin' Rockford over here.\\" David Chase was a writer/producer for The Rockford Files for many years. Production * This is the only episode that features a teaser scene before the opening credits. * This episode was filmed in June 1998 (ten months after shooting the pilot). * The restaurant's hostess from the pilot episode is now in a new role as Christopher's girlfriend, Adriana La Cerva. Drea de Matteo was cast as a restaurant hostess in the pilot episode only, but creator David Chase liked her performance so much that he developed the role of Adriana starting with this episode. Reception Alan Sepinwall was mildly positive toward the episode, writing that \\"some of it ‚Äì particularly anything involving Tony and Livia [‚Ä¶] feels fully-formed and very much of a piece with what we would come to know as one of the greatest shows ever made. And some of it is David Chase still fiddling with the knobs and levers\\"; Sepinwall considered the family-oriented scenes strong while viewing the subplot about the car theft as \\"still on the broader, lighter end of the comedy spectrum, [‚Ä¶] It's not bad, but it's not quite right, either.\\" In The A.V. Club, however, Emily VanDerWerff praised \\"46 Long\\" as \\"a confident expansion of the show's universe\\", considering it an example of \\"the show's keen sense of generational conflict, of the ways that different kinds of people come into conflict with each other.\\" Music * The song played when the truck driver drives up to where Brendan and Christopher are waiting to hijack his truck is \\"Piel Morena\\" by Thal√≠a. * The song Tony sings at breakfast as Carmela tells him of Mr. Miller's stolen car is \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\". * The song played at the Bada Bing when Tony talks to Livia on the phone is \\"Instrumental\\" by Zino and the Human Beatbox. * The song played when Pussy goes over the books at his car shop is \\"This Time\\" by Richard Blandon & The Dubs. * The song played when Paulie and Pussy go to the coffee shop in search of the thieves is \\"Bop Hop\\" by Brooklyn Funk Essentials. * The song the Trinidadian nurse sings to herself as she does chores around Livia's house is \\"Let Me Call You Sweetheart\\". * The song played when Paulie and Pussy find the thieves apartment is \\"Chica Bonita (Levante las Manos)\\" by Artie the 1 Man Party. * The song played when Christopher and Brendan discuss hijacking the truck containing Italian suits at the nightclub is the Hardshell Mix of \\"Party Girl\\" by Ultra Nate. * The song played when Tony suffers a panic attack while packing up Livia's house is Symphony #3, Op. 36, by Henryk G√≥recki. * The song played when Tony beats Georgie with the phone and into the end credits is \\"Battle Flag\\" by Pigeonhed.

Miguel Mateo Maldonado y Cabrera (1695‚Äì1768) was a Mestizo painter born in Oaxaca but moved to Mexico City, the capital of Viceroyalty of New Spain.Bailey, Gauvin Alexander. Art of Colonial Latin America. London: Phaidon Press 2005, p. 418 During his lifetime, he was recognized as the greatest painter in all of New Spain. He created religious and secular art for the Catholic Church and wealthy patrons. His casta paintings, depicting interracial marriage among Amerindians, Spaniards and Africans, are considered among the genre's finest. Cabrera's paintings range from tiny works on copper to enormous canvases and wall paintings. He also designed altarpieces and funerary monuments.Bargellini, Clara. \\"Cabrera, Miguel.\\" In Dav√≠d Carrasco (ed). The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures, vol 1. New York : Oxford University Press, 2001  Biography  Miguel Cabrera, El arc√°ngel san Rafael (c. 1745-1768), the lobby of the House Museum Guillermo Tovar de Teresa at the Museo Soumaya Portrait of Cabrera's patron, Archbishop Manuel Jos√© Rubio y Salinas, 1751. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Virgin of Guadalupe with St. John the Baptist, Fray Juan de Zum√°rraga and Juan Diego Cabrera was born in Antequera, today's Oaxaca, Oaxaca, and moved to Mexico City in 1719. He may have studied under the Rodr√≠guez Ju√°rez brothers or Jos√© de Ibarra. Cabrera was a favorite painter of Archbishop Manuel Jos√© Rubio y Salinas, whose portrait he twice painted, and of the Jesuits, which earned him many commissions. In 1756 he created an important analytical study of the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Maravilla americana y conjunto de raras maravillas observadas con la direcci√≥n de las reglas del arte de la pintura (1756) (\\"American marvel and ensemble of rare wonders observed with the direction of the rules of the art of painting\\", often referred to in English simply as American Marvel).americanmarvel.org Cabrera and a group of six other painters analyzed the painting, with scientific eyes, not religious, identifying four different substances used in the painting: \\"oil, tempera with agglutinates, an aguazo, and a fresco-like tempera.\\" In Cabrera's assessment, no painter was capable of using such techniques in the eighteenth century, much less in the sixteenth century, when the image was created.Peterson, Jeanette Favrot. Visualizing Guadalupe: From Black Madonna to Queen of the Americas. Austin: University of Texas Press 2014, p. 107. Cabrera was concerned that there was a proliferation of inferior copies of the painting, and let it be known that the noted seventeenth-century painter, Juan Correa, used a waxed paper template of the image, so that down to the last detail, copies were faithful to the original. Cabrera's atelier created many copies of the image, some of which were signed by Cabrera himself. He sought faithfulness to the original image but to add luster and power to the copies, some paintings had the notation \\"touched to the original,\\" [Tocada a su Original] with the date.Peterson, Visualizing Guadalupe, pp. 198-99 In 1752 he was again permitted access to the icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe to make three copies with the aid of fellow painters, Jos√© de Alc√≠bar and Jos√© Bentura Arn√°ez. The copies were for his patron Archbishop Jos√© Manuel Rubio y Salinas, one for Pope Benedict XIV, and a third to use \\"as a model for further copies.\\"Peterson, Visualizing Guadalupe, p. 194. The essential purpose of Maravilla Americana was to affirm the 1666 opinions of the witnesses who swore that the image of the Virgin was of a miraculous nature. However, he also elaborated a novel opinion: the image was crafted with a unique variety of techniques. He contended that the Virgin's face and hands were painted in oil paint, while her tunic, mandorla, and the cherub at her feet were all painted in egg tempera. Finally, her mantle was executed in gouache. He observed that the golden rays emanating from the Virgin seemed to be of dust that was woven into the very fabric of the canvas, which he asserted was of \\"a coarse weave of certain threads which we vulgarly call pita,\\" a cloth woven from palm fibers. His involvement in the analysis of the Guadalupe image was part of his long term campaign to raise the status of painters from mere artisans to respected practitioners of the liberal arts. It came at the same time that Mexican archbishop Manuel Jos√© Rubio y Salinas (1749-1765) sought the designation of the Virgin of Guadalupe as a universal patron. Jesuit Francisco L√≥pez was the advocate in Rome for her cause. Benedict XIV recognized Guadalupe with her own feast day, starting in 1754.Peterson, Visualizing Guadalupe, p. 298.Cuadrielo, Jaime. \\"Zodiaco Mariano: Una alegoria de Miguel Cabrera\\" in Zodiaco Mariano, pp. 21-128.

A concise history of Mexico. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999: 97 (retrieved through Google Books, 1 May 2009). . Most of the rest of his works are also religious in nature; as the official painter of the Archbishop of Mexico, Cabrera painted his and other portraits. In 1760, Cabrera created The Virgin of the Apocalypse, which describes the chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation. He is also known for his posthumous portrait of the seventeenth-century poet Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz. Cabrera is currently most famous for his casta paintings. One of the sixteen in the set that was missing for many years was purchased by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2015.

It serves as part of the Central Arizona Project (CAP) while also providing water for the Maricopa Water District. The dam creates Lake Pleasant with water from the Agua Fria and also the CAP aqueduct. In addition, it affords flood protection, hydroelectric power production and recreational opportunities. Construction on the dam began in 1985 and ended in 1994. Its reservoir submerged the Old Waddell Dam which was completed in 1927 after decades of planning. History Old Waddell Dam The Old Waddell Dam approximately halfway submerged under rising waters of the new reservoir, circa 1992 First referred to as the Frogs Tank Dam, the original Waddell Dam was the ambition of local businessmen who wanted to develop a project that used the Agua Fria for the irrigation of around of land. This was to be accomplished with a storage dam, diversion dam and system of canals. Their advancement of the project began in 1888 with the formation of the Agua Fria Water and Land Company. The company hired George Beardsley's Agua Fria Construction Company, and in 1892, construction on the project began. In 1895, Beardsley died, and his brother William who was now president of the Water and Land Company helped continue the project. In 1896, due to a lack of funding caused by poor nationwide economic conditions, the project was halted. The Water and Land Company soon went bankrupt, but William Beardsley would keep the project alive. Work had been primarily done on the diversion dam and canal while only the foundation of the storage dam, a gravity dam, was completed. The diversion dam, Camp Dyer Diversion Dam, was named after Edgar J. Dyer, a surveyor on the project. After nearly 30 years of struggling with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant to assist with designing. Pleasant recommended hiring the engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the storage dam at the Frogs Tank site. The gravity dam design was dropped, and a relatively new, cheaper and improved but controversial design was adopted: the multiple-arch buttress dam. In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley- Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but the bonds had yet to be purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died. His son, Robert took direction of the project along with Pleasant. In early 1926, Pleasant eventually sold the needed bonds to the New York firm Brandon, Gordon and Waddell. The firm sent Donald Ware Waddell to oversee construction. Although the initial implementation of worker camps and site preparation had begun in 1925, the main effort of construction began in 1926 with the diversion of the Agua Fria River. In that same year, the dam was renamed to Pleasant Dam. By February 1927, concrete pouring for the 20 buttresses was nearing completion. The dam was complete in October 1927. Its construction employed a maximum of 600 workers and cost over $3.3 million. Prior to its inauguration, cracks were discovered in the dam's buttresses. This led to much controversy over the new design of the dam and whether it was safe in the long-term which delayed its inauguration until February 1928. The situation was exacerbated on 12 March 1928 after the St. Francis Dam in California had a catastrophic failure. In 1929, after a series of hearings and debates, which eventually reached the state legislature, the State Water Commissioner ordered the spillway for the dam to be lowered to prevent excess water levels and stress on the dam. It was also required that specific water levels in the reservoir be maintained. The dam was rehabilitated until 1935, and a steel roadbed was installed atop it that same year. In the early 1960s, it was renamed the Waddell Dam. New Waddell Dam The New Waddell Dam in 1992 with Old Waddell Dam in background In 1973, construction on the Central Arizona Project (CAP) began while many of its facilities were still being planned and approved. One integral part of the project was a storage dam on the Salt River, Orme Dam. However, in 1977, US President Jimmy Carter recommended that Orme Dam and two other projects on the Gila River System be removed from the CAP plan because of their negative impacts and cost. While the two other projects (Hooker and Charleston Dam) were easily removed, Orme was not. Orme's removal was hampered by controversy that led to the creation of the Central Arizona Water Control Study (CAWCS) in 1979 after Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus requested that the Bureau of Reclamation identify a replacement. In 1980, the CAWCS recommended the removal of any storage units on the Gila River. Recent flooding within the CAWCS area and the Orme Dam problem led to an expansion of the study to include dams for flood control. Three years later, the Bureau of Reclamation and the State of Arizona agreed on an alternative to Orme. This was known as Plan 6, and it recommended four projects: a reconstruction of the Stewart Mountain Dam, a new or larger Roosevelt Dam, the Cliff Dam on the Verde River and finally, the New Waddell Dam on the Agua Fria River (a tributary of the Gila River). On November 6, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt recommended Plan 6. In April 1984, it was approved with the exception of the Cliff Dam, which needed further study and would eventually be removed from CAP. In 1985, construction on the New Waddell Dam began with the excavation of its foundation. A diversion tunnel was constructed along with another to divert water releases from the Old Waddell Dam to the Beardsley Canal. Construction on the dam's intakes continued through 1991, and by the end of 1992, a controlled breach was performed on two arches of the Old Waddell Dam, allowing its reservoir to fill freely behind the New Waddell Dam, which was already mostly inundated. By 1994, the reservoir was filled and had nearly tripled the size of the Old Waddell Dam reservoir. In that same year, the dam's pump-generating plant (New Waddell Pump-Generating Plant) began operation. The dam's cost was in excess of $625 million. Large sediment releases from the New Waddell Dam deteriorated the Camp Dyer Diversion Dam downstream. This masonry dam had to be rehabilitated by the Bureau in 1992. Design and operation The New Waddell Dam with adjacent irrigation and power facilities The New Waddell Dam is high from the riverbed and high from its bedrock foundation. It is a zoned earth-fill type and is long; containing of material. The dam has a crest width of and a base width of . The reservoir created by the dam, Lake Pleasant, has a capacity of at its maximum elevation above sea level: . At maximum elevation, its surface area is . The maximum conservation storage level of the reservoir is when the reservoir has a surface area of . Conservation storage for the reservoir is and minimum storage . The dam sits at the head of a catchment area. Located northwest of the dam and serving excess water levels are two different spillways: a long un-gated free flow with a crest elevation of and a long fuse plug embankment with an elevation of . The free flow spillway has a discharge capacity of and the fuse plug . At an elevation of , both spillways would have a combined capacity of . Water from the dam's reservoir is released through its outlet works or power plant to either the Waddell Canal or into Hank Raymond Lake, which is formed just downstream of the dam by the Camp Dryer Diversion Dam. The diversion dam is a composite concrete and masonry dam with a height of and length of . It can store up to at an elevation of . Water from Hank Raymond Lake is diverted into the Beardsley Canal, which has a main extension long to serve of the Maricopa Water District (MWD). The Beardsley Canal also has an interconnection south of the dam at with the CAP aqueduct that allows it to receive additional water from that source. Water released into the long Waddell Canal first travels under the Agua Fria River via a long siphon before being returned to the surface canal where it continues south to meet the CAP aqueduct just west of Arizona State Route 303. The capacity of the pump- generating plant, Waddall Canal and siphon is while the outlet works for the diversion dam and Beardsley Canal are , but only can be diverted to the canals at a time. Water from the New Waddell Dam reservoir augments supply in the CAP and helps deliver 15% more CAP water to Arizona. Water in Lake Pleasant is divided between the CAP () and MWD (). Water from the CAP aqueduct is also drawn into Lake Pleasant via the New Waddell Pump-Generating Plant. During the winter months, when energy rates are low, additional water in the aqueduct is pumped a maximum of up into the lake for storage. During the summer months, when energy rates are higher, water is released back down through the generators for hydroelectric power production. Sale of this electricity is being used to pay part of the dam's cost. The pump-generating plant contains four pumps and four pump-generators and has an installed capacity of . Recreation Lake Pleasant, created by the dam, offers recreational opportunities to tourists and locals. The lake is served by a marina and surrounding areas containing over 450 picnic sites, 225 camping sites and several miles of trails. Because the lake is seasonal, fluctuating up to annually, these facilities are located for accessibility. Environmental impact Before the New Waddell Dam was constructed, two phases of a three- phase study were carried out to determine the effects of the dam on fisheries. Completed in 2005, the third phase of the study determined that the larger reservoir has less nutrient concentrations due to CAP water introduction and that water fluctuations have reduced fish cover, likely affecting food and spawning. Large mouth bass populations have also declined but striped bass have entered the lake, likely by eggs transferred through CAP water. Around the lake, Reclamation has taken steps to protect wildlife habitats, including those for bald eagles and Gila topminnows.

It covers an area of 3407 square kilometres and has a population of 24,000 people. San Pedro includes part of the Paran√° River watershed, part of the Uruguay River watershed, and the Sierra Central that divides these two systems. The Capital The capital of San Pedro Department is the town of San Pedro. It is situated in the Sierra Central, at 26¬∞38'S 54¬∞07'W, 575 m a.s.l. The town is characterized by native Parana Pines or Kuri'y (Araucaria angustifolia) scattered amongst the houses and small businesses. Origins The original inhabitants of San Pedro were the indigenous Kaingangues, not to be confused with the Mbya Guarani on the coast of the Paran√° River. The Kaingangues lived by hunting, gathering, and planting crops in small clearings in the forest. Although they were apparently never numerous, the Kaingangues had a reputation as fearful warriors. Europeans were afraid to venture into central Misiones until the late 19th century. Despite this fear, in 1840, a shortage of yerba mate(and resulting high prices) inspired an expedition to central Misiones. Yerba mate is a native plant used in infusions, and harvested, at that time, from the Atlantic forest, where it grew wild. Under the leadership of their chief, Fracran, the Kaingangues massacred the expedition members. The only survivor of the expedition was a young boy, Bonifacio Maidana, who was adopted by an influential member of the Kaingangues. Over the next decades, Europeans kept away from central Misiones and the Kaingangues. Maidana grew up and gained power in the Kaingangue community. Finally, he disputed Fracran's leadership. Fracran escaped to Brazil, and Maidana replaced him as chief. From that time on, the Kaingangues began seeking peace with the European colonists in the south, and finally, in 1876, Maidana signed the \\"pacto de la selva\\" or \\"treaty of the forest\\", permitting Europeans to harvest yerba mate in the area that today is San Pedro. The Treaty however failed to work and a War of extermination occurred. Many Kaingangues were killed and very few remain today. The village of San Pedro was established. Some Kaingangues settled there; others left for Brazil; today, there are none left in Misiones. Industry San Pedro's industry, until recently, was based almost entirely on harvesting natural resources: first wild yerba mate, and later kuri'y or Parana Pine. Around 1983, the public land around the capital was colonized by small-holder farmers. Now, the economy is based mostly on wood and tobacco. Population Today, most people in San Pedro have subsistence farms or work in forestry. San Pedro has the highest rate of poverty among Misiones' departments: 40% of people do not have their basic needs satisfied. Outside the town of San Pedro, only 15% of farmers own their own land. Natural Heritage right San Pedro's native vegetation is Atlantic forest or Mata Atlantica, one of the world's most diverse and endangered ecosystems (Myers et al. 2000). In San Pedro, much of the remaining forest is protected in five provincial parks and the UNESCO Yaboti Biosphere Reserve. Cruce Caballero Provincial Park, just 6 square kilometres, protects some of the last remaining primary forest in Misiones. San Pedro is famous for its Parana Pine (Araucaria angustifolia) forest, protected in Cruce Caballero and Araucaria Provincial Parks. Threatened animal species associated with this forest include the Araucaria Tit-Spinetail (Leptasthenura setaria), the Brown Howling Monkey (Alouatta guariba), and the Vinaceous Amazon (Amazona vinacea).

The series, a summer replacement and the first daytime game show to air on ABC since it ended its game show block a year earlier, ran only nine weeks, replacing repeats of Webster, which had in turn replaced Double Talk. It was temporarily replaced by reruns of Mr. Belvedere before being permanently replaced with The Home Show on January 18, 1988. ABC would not attempt another daytime game show after Bargain Hunters until three years later, when it revived Match Game. Bargain Hunters featured home shopping segments in which viewers could purchase items featured on the show, a unique feature among daytime game shows. The central conceit of the show was that contestants were pitted directly against each other in a series of small games, all of which centered around the contestants assessing which prize from a given selection was marked furthest below its retail price. The series was hosted by Peter Tomarken and produced by Merrill Heatter Productions. Games Each episode featured six contestants, with two competing in each of three separate games. The winner of each game advanced to the Super Savers round. Bargain Quiz Tomarken announced an item and asked whether or not it would be a bargain at a certain price. Players buzzed-in to guess. Getting it right won a point (indicated by a diamond lit on their podium). Getting it wrong meant their opponent received a point. The first player to get three points won the round and received a bonus prize. Bargain Trap Five prizes were shown on stage, each with a price tag. Four of the prizes were bargains, displaying a price lower than retail, while the fifth was the \\"Trap\\" and had a marked-up price. Players went back and forth, picking items they believed were bargains. If one of them picked the Trap, they automatically lost and their opponent won the round, along with whatever prizes they had already chosen. If the Trap was the first item picked, the opponent won it. If both players picked two bargains, leaving only the Trap, then a tiebreaker was played. Both players secretly wrote down the amount by which they believed the Trap had been marked up from retail; the player with the closer guess won. Bargain Busters A prize was shown and players chose a price from three choices. The prizes were selected from stores across the country, and listed at a closeout price. Tomarken would announce the store's name and location before each item. Each player locked in their choice, and a right answer won a point. The one with the most points after three prizes won the round, and received all three prizes shown. If there was a tie after three prizes, a fourth was brought out with no price choices. The players each secretly wrote down their guess at the price, and the one who came closer won. Super Savers The three winners came onstage to play the final round. Seven prizes were shown, each displaying a bargain price. Each player chose the three prizes that they believed would save them the most money. The player whose combined total was the farthest below retail for his/her chosen prizes became the day's winner and received those items plus a grand prize, usually a trip. Home Shopping After every game, a trumpet fanfare sounded signifying a \\"Bargain Shopper\\" segment. Home viewers were offered an item at a bargain price, and could call a number to order it. Usually the item being offered was just seen in the previous game. The three items were shown again at the end of the show.

It is produced from ammonia, formaldehyde, and sodium cyanide or hydrogen cyanide. Worldwide capacity is estimated at 100 thousand tonnes per year. NTA is also cogenerated as an impurity in the synthesis of EDTA, arising from reactions of the ammonia coproduct.Hart, J.

The uses of NTA are similar to those of EDTA, both being chelating agents. It is used for water softening and as a replacement to sodium and potassium triphosphate in detergents, and cleansers. In one application, NTA as a chelating agent removes Cr, Cu, and As from wood that had been treated with chromated copper arsenate.Fang-Chih, C.; Ya-Nang, W.; Pin-Jui, C.; Chun-Han, K. Factors affecting chelating extraction of Cr, Cu, and As from CCA-treated wood. J. Environ. Manag. 2013, 122. Laboratory uses In the laboratory, this compound is used in complexometric titrations. A variant of NTA is used for protein isolation and purification in the His-tag method. The modified NTA is used to immobilize nickel on a solid support. This allows purification of proteins containing a tag consisting of six histidine residues at either terminus.qiaexpressionist The his-tag binds the metal of metal chelator complexes. Previously, iminodiacetic acid was used for that purpose. Now, nitrilotriacetic acid is more commonly used. For laboratory uses Ernst Hochuli et al. 1987 coupled the NTA ligand and Nickel-ions to agarose beads.

Toxicity and Environment Nitriloacetic acid can cause eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation; and can cause kidney and bladder damage. The compound is anticipated to have the potential to cause human cancers. In contrast to EDTA, NTA is easily biodegradable and is almost completely removed during wastewater treatment.

Butorphanol is available as the tartrate salt in injectable, tablet, and intranasal spray formulations. The tablet form is only used in dogs, cats and horses due to low bioavailability in humans. It was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1979. Medical uses The most common indication for butorphanol is management of migraine using the intranasal spray formulation. It may also be used parenterally for management of moderate-to- severe pain, as a supplement for balanced general anesthesia, and management of pain during labor. Butorphanol is also quite effective at reducing post- operative shivering (owing to its Kappa agonist activity). Butorphanol is more effective in reducing pain in women than in men. Pharmacology Butorphanol exhibits partial agonist and antagonist activity at the Œº-opioid receptor, as well as partial agonist activity at the Œ∫-opioid receptor (Ki = 2.5 nM; EC50 = 57 nM; Emax = 57%). Stimulation of these receptors on central nervous system neurons causes an intracellular inhibition of adenylate cyclase, closing of influx membrane calcium channels, and opening of membrane potassium channels. This leads to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane potential and suppression of action potential transmission of ascending pain pathways. Because of its Œ∫-agonist activity, at analgesic doses butorphanol increases pulmonary arterial pressure and cardiac work. Additionally, Œ∫-agonism can cause dysphoria at therapeutic or supertherapeutic doses; this gives butorphanol a lower potential for abuse than other opioid drugs. Side effects As with other opioid analgesics, central nervous system effects (such as sedation, confusion, and dizziness) are considerations with butorphanol. Nausea and vomiting are common. Less common are the gastrointestinal effects of other opioids (mostly constipation). Another side effect experienced by people taking the medication is increased perspiration. Society and culture Name Within the INN, USAN, BAN, and AAN naming systems this drug is known as butorphanol, while within JAN it is named torbugesic. As the tartrate salt, butorphanol is known as butorphanol tartrate (USAN, BAN). Its tradename Stadol was recently discontinued by the manufacturer. It is now only available in its generic formulations manufactured by Apotex, Mylan, Novex and Ben Venue Laboratories. Availability Butorphanol is available in the U.S. as a generic drug; it is available in various nations under one of any number of trade names, including Moradol and Beforal (Brand name Stadol no longer available in the US); veterinary trade names include Butorphic, Dolorex, Morphasol, Torbugesic, and Torbutrol. Legality Butorphanol is listed under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 and in the United States is a Schedule IV Narcotic controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 9720; being in Schedule IV it is not subject to annual aggregate manufacturing quotas. The free base conversion ratio of the hydrochloride is 0.69. Butorphanol was originally in Schedule II and at one point it was decontrolled. Veterinary use In veterinary anesthesia, butorphanol (trade name: Torbugesic) is widely used as a sedative and analgesic in dogs, cats and horses. For sedation, it may be combined with tranquilizers such as alpha-2 agonists (medetomidine), benzodiazepines, or acepromazine in dogs, cats and exotic animals. It is frequently combined with xylazine or detomidine in horses. Butorphanol is frequently used for post-operative and accident-related pain in small mammals such as dogs, cats, ferrets, coatis, raccoons, mongooses, various marsupials, some rodents and perhaps some larger birds, both in the operating suite and as a regular prescription medication for home use, for management of moderate to severe pain. Although butorphanol is commonly used for pain relief in reptiles, no studies (as of 2014) have conclusively shown that is an effective analgesic in reptiles. Use in horses Butorphanol is a commonly used narcotic for pain relief in horses. It is administered either IM or IV, with its analgesic properties beginning to take effect about 15 minutes after injection and lasting 4 hours. It is also commonly paired with sedatives, such as xylazine and detomidine, to make the horse easier to handle during veterinary procedures. Side effects specific to horses include sedation, CNS excitement (displayed by head pressing or tossing). Overdosing may result in seizures, falling, salivation, constipation, and muscle twitching. If an overdose occurs, a narcotic antagonist, such as naloxone, may be given. Caution should be used if butorphanol is administered in addition to other narcotics, sedatives, depressants, or antihistamines as it will cause an additive effect. Butorphanol can cross the placenta, and it will be present in the milk of lactating mares who are given the drug. The drug is also prohibited for use in competition by most equestrian organizations, including the FEI, which considers it a class A drug.

Each motorcycle has a sidehack (a sidecar with a rail but no sidewalls or seat), in which a passenger rides and tilts to one side or another when going around curves. The credits thank the \\"Southern California Sidehack Association\\"; sidehacking is also known as sidecarcross or \\"sidecar motocross racing\\".  Plot  The film centers on Rommel, a mechanic at a motorbike repair shop who works alongside his partner Luke, and competes in sidehack-style races. He and his fianc√©e Rita plan to get married soon. One day at work, he meets J.C., a hot-tempered entertainer and his crew, when he brings in his bike for repair. He sees a sidehack bike in the shop and takes a liking to it. Rommel offers J.C. and his group to join him in a sidehack event the upcoming weekend. At the event, J.C. enjoys watching Rommel race on the sidehack. Rommel offers J.C to give a ride on a sidehack with him at his and Rita's cabin, and he accepts. After a fun day of racing on Rommel's sidehack, everyone has a get together dinner in the cabin and J.C. offers Rommel to join him, who politely declines. J.C. loses his temper as a result, and takes out his anger on his girlfriend, Paisley, after telling him he's not interested in his offer. The next day, while Rommel and Luke are working on a bike, Paisley comes over and tries to seduce Rommel into getting with her, wanting to get away from J.C., but he rejects her and sends her away crying. Later, when J.C. and his men return to their hotel, they find Paisley drunk and her clothes tattered, claiming that Rommel raped her. Angered, J.C. and his gang find Rommel and Rita in their cabin making love, and proceed to beat Rommel unconscious, then they rape and kill Rita afterwards. Luke finds out what happened to Rommel and informs the police. J.C., now on the verge of being wanted for his actions, has to hide himself in isolation. Despite Luke's warnings to let the police handle the situation, Rommel wants revenge on J.C. for killing his former fianc√©e, and gathers a group of men to back him up, consisting of one of J.C.'s (now former) henchmen, Nero (who joined Rommel after finally having enough of J.C.'s abuse), muscle-bound Big Jake, bailed out criminal Crapout, and another one of J.C.'s henchmen, Cooch (who's secretly working undercover for J.C.). Rommel and his gang head out into the canyons where J.C. is hiding. Luke goes after Rommel to stop him from getting his revenge. Meanwhile, Rommel discusses the plan on what they're going to do to J.C., which involves being stealthy, using their hands and no guns in spite of the risk that J.C.'s men may have some on them. They're reluctant on the plan, but stick to it regardless. The next morning, Cooch sneaks over to J.C.'s hideout while everyone is still asleep and fills him in on everything, and after he takes off, Paisley breaks up with J.C. after putting up with all of his abuse and tries to escalate his fury with Rommel. Angry, he strangles Paisley to death, and then apologizes to her dead body and chides her for making him so angry. Luke attempts to talk Rommel out of getting his revenge on J.C., but refuses and sticks with the plan. Suddenly, they see Cooch sneaking back into the spot where everyone was sleeping, and Rommel, Big Jake, Nero and Crapout gang up on him trying to find out what's going on. Cooch feigns ignorance, and they beat him up to get him to talk. Finally giving in, he tells Rommel J.C. is hiding in a rock quarry in the canyons, and Rommel orders Crapout to tie him up. Rommel goes over to Luke and asks him to call the police to let them know where J.C. is hiding, finally acknowledging that going after J.C. isn't worth it. However, he still keeps a tied-up Cooch to his side while keeping an eye out on J.C. to make sure he doesn't escape from his hideout, as Rommel's men stick with the original plan, resulting in Big Jake being killed after taking down two of J.C.'s men through stealth, and Cooch escaping, pleading J.C. not to kill Rommel, only for J.C. to kill his former weasel for being caught. With two of Rommel's men already killed, Nero and Crapout decide to play by their own rules and escape on a bike as the latter kills all of J.C.'s men with a gun instead of a battering ram as he originally planned, while J.C. attempts to shoot Rommel after Cooch exposed him. With Rommel and J.C. left in the quarry, no guns on them, the two men brawl. When Rommel manages to gain the upper hand, he elects to walk away when the police are about to arrive, but J.C. picks up a gun and shoots Rommel from behind. The last images of the film are a flashback of Rommel and his fianc√©e rolling about in a grassy field, superimposed over a shot of Rommel's dead body.

Edits The writers were unaware of the film's darker content when they selected it for the show, only watching it in its entirety during their usual joke-writing sessions. They were horrified to discover the scene in which Rommel's girlfriend Rita is raped and killed, juxtaposed with shots of Luke and Lois' children playfully roughhousing. This scene, and the discovery of Rita's nearly nude body, were removed from the episode. To make up for the missing plot point, the character of Crow later remarks, \\"For those of you playing along at home, Rita is dead.\\" According to the series' head writer (and future host) Michael J. Nelson, \\"We were all traumatized, the scene got cut, and from that day forward, movies were watched in their entirety (for such potentially offensive content) before they were selected.\\"The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, pg 21 (1996). Earlier in the episode, the dinner scene at Rommel and Rita's cabin is also edited slightly: when J.C. flies into a rage and Nero tries to calm him, J.C. pushes him away, saying \\"Take your hands off me, you dirty nigger!\\" The latter half of the line is muted while Joel and the bots loudly rebuke J.C.

The game, originally titled as King Arthur: The Quest of The Fair Unknown, is based on Arthurian legends and uses a point-and-click interface. Chronicles of the Sword tells the story of the young knight Gawain on a quest to save Camelot from the scheming witch queen Morgana. It has received largely negative reviews. Gameplay Chronicles of the Sword is a third-person, mouse-based point-and-click graphic adventure game, featuring sprite based characters in 3D pre-rendered environments with switching viewpoints (described as similar to Alone in the Dark). The game's user interface uses a context-sensitive cursor for movement and actions, and a classic adventure conversation system based on choosing dialogue options. It also includes a few action game elements in the form of simple combat sequences that are interactive only on the Regular difficulty level and are automated (shown as cutscenes) on the Easy setting. Plot Setting The sword and sorcery story is set in Albion, Sub-Roman Britain, circa 420. The player assumes the role of Gawain, a young apprentice knight about to be ordained by King Arthur and struggling to uphold virtues of his peaceful and prosperous kingdom. Gawain is ordered by Merlin to seek out and vanquish Queen Morgana, Arthur's half-sister and evil sorceress, before she can destroy Arthur and seize the throne of Albion. Story The game begins with Morgana cruelly murdering the court priest of King Arthur's castle of Camelot, located just as Gawain was about to be given his knighthood. She plots to reveal Sir Lancelot Du Lac and Lady Guinevere's affair to the world, which would help her overthrow Arthur and take over. The court wizard Merlin has discovered her nefarious plans, and the unknowing Gawain is used by Merlin to force Morgana into appearing before the king. Morgana is tried for treason and sentenced to be banished from the kingdom, but she then openly declares war on him and uses her supernatural powers to kill the guards and vanish. After Morgana's later attempts to assassinate Arthur is thwarted by Merlin, the king finally decides she needs to be stopped once and for all, and orders her to be found and put to death. Merlin then handpicks Gawain to be instrument of Morgana's destruction. The young knight ventures to ferret out various objects for the creation of a special ring that would grant him an immunity from Morgana's black magic, who knows of his mission and will try to eliminate him. With the ring on, Gawain finally goes off on the journey to rid the world of Morgana, who has hidden in a forbidding fortress on the island of Lyonesse. On the way there, Morgana shows up to kill Gawain's companion, her former servant named Helie. Once in Morgana's castle, Gawain gets captured and is sentenced to death, but manages to escape after defeating a giant snake. He then works to overcome Morgana and slay her vampire bodyguard Ragnar. Ultimately, Gawain is unable to end Morgana's life, but the witch's own Faerie minions help him imprison her inside Lyonesse. She swears vengeance while he returns to Camelot as a hero to join the Order of the Round Table.Bamse, Chronicles of the Sword, czƒô≈õƒá 2. Secret Service issue 38 (September 1996), pages 48-49. Characters *Gawain - The player character, eldest son of King Lot and Arthur's sister Morgause. Gawain arrived at Camelot just the previous night before the start of the game, after having been nominated by Sir Lancelot to become a knight of King Arthur's Round Table.Chronicles of the Sword PC game manual. Later, Merlin order him to carry out the execution of Morgana using all means at his disposal. Gawain is chosen for this task precisely due to his youth and lack of experience, for Merlin hopes it will confuse and flatter the vain Morgana. *Queen Morgana - The game's main antagonist, Morgana is King Arthur's immoral half-sister who constantly conspires against him and desires to be the ruler of all Albion. She is a witch of great dark power who once learnt much of her sorcery from Merlin himself, but now she and Merlin are bitter rivals and their past intimacy means nothing to them. Morgana has made many attempts on Arthur's life and is rumoured to be behind many mysterious deaths and disappearances, but never has left any trace of her involvement. A lascivious femme fatale of great beauty, Morgana is a master of intrigue and deception, and even without her magical powers she would make a dangerous adversary. Like Merlin, Morgana is semi-immortal, which requires Gawain to magically trap her soul in order to defeat her. *Merlin (Merrdyn) - Merlin is a powerful warlock who is several hundred years old and may have been born in Atlantis. Merlin has been an influential figure for a very long time, working towards a greater goal known to no-one but himself. He was advisor to Vortigern, the last great king of Britain. When Ambrosius Aurelianus and Uther Pendragon killed Vortigen and stole his throne, Merlin appeared to change his allegiance and support Ambrosius until his death, and then Uther when he succeeded him. It is rumoured that he and Morgana had a short, explosive affair, but now they are sworn enemies. Merlin is hard drinking and often is callous when dealing with other people. *King Arthur (Arthus) - Arthur is noble king of Britain, cultivating the ideal of the chivalrous knight operating under an honourable code of conduct. He started the fellowship of the Round Table after drawing the sword from the stone, thereby fulfilling a prophecy and proving his right to rule. Years ago, Merlin informed Arthur that once he was tricked into going to bed with Morgana, disguised by a spell, and the issue of their union was to be the instrument of Arthur's death. Arthur loves his wife, Guinevere dearly, but projects onto her an ideal which she cannot possibly live up to. *Queen Guinevere - Guinevere, the King's wife, is a beautiful young queen who dresses and walks in a way which would tempt most men at court. She enjoys flirting with young knights, a habit the King finds irritating. Lady Guinevere is intelligent but too young and inexperienced to offer Arthur help and be a confidant. Morgana wants to use her romance with Lancelot in her plot against Arhur. *Ragnar - Ragnar is a sadistic Saxon vampire based at Lyonesse. He is entirely devoted to Morgana, despises mortals, and is very difficult to destroy. Development The game has been originally being developed by Synthetic Dimensions (then functioning under the name of DCD, or Dimension Creative Design) as King Arthur: The Quest of The Fair Unknown. The development team boasted of having spent a full year researching for a preparatory work into the production. According to Synthetic Dimensions, they have discovered \\"that there are few known facts, but plenty of mismatched half-truths, so the game sets out to detail a hitherto unheard part of the story.\\"Chronicles of the Sword. Computer & Video Games 172 (March 1996), pages 90-91. In a mid-1994 version of the game, as shown to the Edge magazine, the player character was the titular Fair Unknown (Gingalain), sent to a Welsh castle to rescue a queen. Upon reaching the castle, the player had to battle various enemies, including a giant serpent (here with a backstory related to the Questing Beast), a pair of mages, and a few undead skeletons (sword fights against an enormous snake and the skeletons are actually featured in the final version, towards the end of the game in Morgana's castle). This initial mission completed, the player would then return to Camelot, \\"where the real meat of the game begins\\" (Chronicles of the Sword begins already in Camelot), and the game would also feature Merlin and Morgana. The version publicly shown at the ECTS '95 was titled Chronicles of the Sword.Messe. PowerPlay (December 1995). The game was advertised as using professional voice actors,Chronicles of the Sword: Psygnosis, Swords, and Sorcery. GamePro issue 99 (December 1996). but their names were not publicly disclosed.

PC Games (April 1996), pages 36-37.), as well as many other techniques, \\"including full-motion video, stop-motion animation, model making, make-up, rendering, pain, and hand animating.\\" Release Chronicles of the Sword was supposed to be released already in November or December 1994, only for the PC Windows platform and on just one CD-ROM.\\"Prescreen: Dimension Creative Design\\". Edge UK Edition 11 (August 1994), pages 30-31. The final game is contained on two discs and was released on February 23, 1996 in North America and on May 31, 1996 in Europe. It was also the second Psygnosis-published game that was based on Arthurian themes, the first being The Legend of Galahad. It was also re-released in 1998. Chronicles of the Sword was ported for the PlayStation because of the ownership of Psygnosis by Sony, and released in June 1996 in Europe and in November 1996 in North America. To promote the game, Sony run win-a- PlayStation contests in some magazines including Hobby Consolas.Concurso. Hobby Consolas issue 58. Reception Chronicles of the Sword was met with generally poor critical reception. As of 2014, the PC version holds the averaged GameRankings score of only 41%, based on five reviews. Game Informer, whose review stated that \\"point and click adventures don't get much worse than this [...] two disc menace,\\" even gave the PlayStation version an award for the worst video game of 1997.Game Informer 58 (February 1998). According to Michael L. House of allgame, Chronicles of the Sword is so \\"frustrating, boring, sloppy and horrible\\" it \\"deserves an award for the 'Worst Adventure Game' in the genre to date.\\" Ron Dulin of GameSpot opined \\"Chronicles of the Sword does have some nice elements, most notably the richly detailed background art and the excellent musical score. But the positive features only manage to distract you from the fact that the game is confusing, frustrating and‚Äîworst of all‚Äîexcruciatingly dull.\\"Ron Dulin, Chronicles of the Sword for PC. GameSpot, June 13, 1996. Art Angel of GamePro described it as \\"so slow it should have been a simple animated movie.\\" While he praised the voice acting and the clean cinematics, he remarked that the player character's slow movements and the excessive precision required in the point-and-clicking make the game dull to the point of being almost unplayable.Art Angel, Chronicles of the Sword. GamePro issue 102 (March 1997), page 97. PC Zone called it a game of \\"a couple of nice puzzles and some lovely graphics - but little else,\\" as the story \\"is dull, consisting of some medieval stereotypes presented in a fancily-rendered environment.\\" T. Liam McDonald of PC Gamer wrote: \\"Synthetic Dimensions has created some of the best-looking visuals yet seen in a traditional adventure game, but they forget to put a meaningful story and game into them. Visually and aurally, it‚Äôs top-notch, but it doesn‚Äôt measure up where it counts: content.\\"T. Liam McDonald, . PC Gamer UK, September 1996. Some reviews lambasted even the game's visuals. Bob Strauss wrote in a 1996 review in Entertainment Weekly that Gawain \\"moves with all the speed and vitality of a knight in a 500-pound suit of armor\\" and the \\"jerky computer- animated characters might have looked impressive a decade ago.\\" According to Game Informer, \\"not only are the graphics completely lame, but the character interface is slow and boring.\\" Several reviews especially criticised the \\"pixel hunting\\" aspect of the gameplay (forcing the player to examine all of the screen while looking for something to interact with). In Computer Gaming World, Scorpia called it \\"a mediocre product at best\\" and added that \\"anyone waning a taste of the real thing is better off reading Le Mort d'Arthur.Scorpia, \\"Oil Those Weapons\\". Computer Gaming World issue 145, pages 111-112. NowGamer gave the PlayStation version the final verdict of \\"dull and painfully S-L-O-W.\\"Chronicles of the Sword, NowGamer.

They are spoken in southern China and northern Vietnam. The Mangic languages consist of Mang and two Pakanic languages, Bolyu and Bugan. Classification Paul Sidwell's tentative classification is as follows.http://people.anu.edu.au/~u9907217/lexico/AA54neighbour-net.jpg *Mangic **Mang **Pakanic: Bolyu, Bugan Mangic, as a unified language group with all three languages above, is recognized by Ilia Peiros (2004) and Jenny & Sidwell (2015), who classified Mang, Bolyu, and Bugan together. Jenny & Sidwell (2015) consider Mangic to be an independent branch of Austroasiatic.Jenny, Mathias and Paul Sidwell, eds (2015). The Handbook of Austroasiatic Languages. Leiden: Brill. Various classifications had previously been proposed for individual Mangic languages. In 1990, Paul K. Benedict argued that Bolyu constitutes a separate Mon-Khmer branch. Edmondson & Gregerson (1996)Edmondson, Jerold A. and Kenneth J. Gregerson. 1996. \\"Bolyu tone in Vietic perspective.\\" Mon‚ÄìKhmer Studies 26: 117-33. listed many phonological and lexical similarities shared by Bolyu and Vietic languages. However, G√©rard Diffloth later suggested that Pakanic (i.e., Bolyu and Bugan) shares an affinity with Palaungic languages and was part of a wider Northern Mon-Khmer group. Nguyen Van Loi also classified Mang within the Samtau group of Waic with Palaungic, although he later classified Mang as a sister of Waic (Sidwell 2009:133). Peiros (2004) includes Mang within Pakanic. Proto-Pakanic, the proto-language ancestral to Bolyu and Bugan but not Mang, was reconstructed by Andrew Hsiu (2016).Hsiu, Andrew. 2016. A preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Pakanic. Hsiu (2017),Hsiu, Andrew. 2017. Hezhang Buyi: a highly endangered Northern Tai language with a Kra substratum. citing Li Xulian (1999), notes that Pakanic languages were formerly spoken further up north in Guizhou and were in close contact with Gelao. Hsiu (2017) also notes that Pakanic languages display loanword influence from Kra languages, and have also influenced Kra languages.

Because of irrigation needs, the water level at the lake sometimes is low enough to kill its self-sustaining fish, but during wet years, the water can overtop Coolidge Dam. Since construction of the dam, the lake has been nearly empty at least 20 times, and has been full only three times.

A wizard is attempting to find his mentor in a large and dangerous labyrinth. The game has a high degree of graphic violence. The music for Apple IIGS version was made by Douglas Fulton. On some conversions, Rob Hubbard and Michael Bartlow are credited. Plot The game begins with the player in control of an unnamed wizard. In the first room, the player is given the option of viewing the image of the character's mentor, another wizard named Mordamir. He is calling for help from deep below in the Labyrinth of Eternity, though he is attempting to communicate to another man named Dunric. The two main types of creatures present in the labyrinth are the goblins and the trolls, who are at war with one another. This is a minor plot element in the game. Depending on the player's actions in the earlier stages of the game, it is also possible for the main character to form an alliance with the goblins. The majority of the story is revealed through dream sequences triggered when the main character rests on straw beds placed throughout the labyrinth. It is eventually revealed that Mordamir is battling against a dragon at the Fountain of Youth. The plot of the game undergoes a twist when the main character finds Dunric having been trapped by Mordamir. In the end, the main character is inevitably confronted by both the dragon and Mordamir. Gameplay The game takes place on a 7- or 8-level labyrinth, depending on the version of the game. The player must solve puzzles, avoid deathtraps, use magic spells (in the form of books and scrolls), and acquire various items in order to survive the labyrinth. However, certain items will bring instant death to the player if used in an unwise and careless manner. Combat in the game is offered in the form of a variety of non-player characters wandering or protecting a specific portion of the map. Fireball spells can be freely used to dispatch these enemies on the isometric field. However, they can not be used once the game has entered combat mode. Combat mode is initiated upon coming into close contact with these characters, and the game play shifts from the standard isometric view to a zoomed-in two-dimensional view in real-time. The real-time battle engine is limited to dodging opponent's attacks and performing sword swings and stabs. In addition to walking, certain levels allow the main character to possess a magic carpet that flies and paddle through water while sitting on a floating barrel. Development Will Harvey had started development on an Apple II game to be called Campaign, intending it to be an online multiplayer RPG. As the story developed, it became a single-player game only. Reception Computer Gaming World praised The Immortals graphics, but stated that the game was really an arcade game as it was too linear to succeed as an RPG. It also criticized the use of save points and the controls and concluded that the game \\"misses the target\\". In 1992, Dragon gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Computer and Video Games magazine was positive about the graphics and control scheme and gave an overall score of 93 out of 100.Leadbetter, Richard (November 1990) The Immortal review ‚Äì page scan at World of Spectrum, Computer and Video Games, issue 108, accessed December 14, 2012 Amiga Power was more mixed, awarding the game 76% and criticising its completely linear nature and lack of replay value, while identifying the graphics as a strength.Winstanley, Mark (November 1993) The Immortal review ‚Äì page scan at Amiga Magazine Rack, Amiga Power, issue 31, accessed December 14, 2012 References  External links   Category:1991 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Amiga games Category:Apple IIGS games Category:Atari ST games Category:Dark fantasy video games Category:DOS games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Rob Hubbard Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Nintendo Switch Online NES games ","title":"The Immortal (video game)"},{"id":"4497763","text":"Michael is a common given name.

Acragas). Life The exact dates of Acron is not known; but, as he is mentioned as being contemporary with Empedocles, who died about the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, he must have lived in the fifth century BC. From Sicily he went to Athens and there opened a philosophical school (). It is said that Acron was in that city during the great plague (430 BC) and that large fires kindled in the streets at his direction for the purpose of purifying the air proved of great service to several of the sick.Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride 80Oribasius, Synops. 6.24, p. 97A√´tius Amidenus, tetrab. 2, serm. 1.94, p. 223Paul Aegin. 2.35, p. 406 There is, however, no mention of this in Thucydides,Thucydides 2.49 &c.; and if Empedocles or Simonides (d. 467 BC) in fact wrote the epitaph on Acron, he may not have been in Athens during the plague. On Acron's return to his native country, the physician asked the senate for a spot of ground where he might build a family tomb. The request was refused at the suggestion of Empedocles, who conceived that such a grant for such a purpose would interfere with the principle of equality that he was anxious to establish at Agrigentum. Because the ironic epitaph on the \\"Acragantine Acron\\" is among the most replete jeux de mot on record, it so challenges translation that it will be given in Greek to preserve the paronomasia of the original: : :: The second line was sometimes read thus: :: More or less: \\"The lofty physician Loftyman of Loftyville, son of a lofty father, is hidden here under a lofty crag in the loftiest of fatherlands,\\" or \\"is covered by the lofty tomb of a very lofty peak.\\" Some attributed the whole epigram to Simonides.Suda s.v. Eudoc., Violar. ap. Villoison, Anecd. Gr. 1.49Diogenes La√´rtius 8.65 Pliny considers Acron as the first of the Empirics.Pliny the Elder, Naturalis historia 29.1 But this has been considered an error, for the sect alluded to did not arise until the third century BC, roughly 200 years after the time of Acron. Some scholars consider that the sect of the Empirici, in order to boast of a greater antiquity than the Dogmatics (founded about 400 BC by Thessalus the son and Polybus the son-in- law of Hippocrates), merely claimed Acron as their founder.Pseudo-Gal., Introd. 4, vol. xiv, p. 683 None of Acron's works are now extant, though he wrote several in the Doric dialect on medical and physical subjects, the titles of which are preserved by the Suda and Eudocia.

The trail ascends Mount Le Conte, the third tallest in the park (and sixth-highest) mountain east of the Mississippi River, and passes Rainbow Falls before absorbing the Alum Cave Trail and terminating near the LeConte Lodge. REF USNPS and GSMNP Information LeConte Creek after heavy rainfall * The Rainbow Falls Trail is approximately the same as the route taken by Paul Adams as he led the first Park Commission trip to LeConte, which helped lead to the formation of the national park. * The trailhead is located inside of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, off Cherokee Orchard Road, from Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Landmarks and overlooks * LeConte Creek * Rainbow Falls * Rocky Spur Trail synopsis Trailhead to Rainbow Falls At nearly 80 feet, Rainbow Falls is the longest plunge of water in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The trail asserts itself from the beginning, immediately ascending Le Conte's flank, alongside the mountain's primary drainage avenue, LeConte Creek, which, due to the abnormally large number of mills that sprouted up along this stream at one time (twelve, at its peak), was once known as \\"Mill Creek\\". The roaring sounds of the creek accompany the footpath for most of the first , only dying down at about the mark, where the trail temporarily jaunts away from the stream. The path soon swings back, crossing over LeConte Creek twice via narrow footbridges over the final mile to Rainbow Falls. When hikers reach Rainbow Falls, they have hiked and are in the presence of the highest single-drop waterfall in the national park. On the somewhat rare occasion of a sunny afternoon at the falls, a lucky onlooker can see a rainbow reflected in the sprayed mist of the waterfall, hence the Rainbow Falls moniker. Rainbow Falls to LeConte Lodge These large boulders can provide hikers some respite during the 6.5-mile (10.6 km) journey to the summit of Mount Le Conte. From Rainbow Falls, the trail continues as a third footbridge over LeConte Creek, which the hiker bids farewell to from this point on. Over the next three miles (5 km), the trail continues its steady climb towards the lodge, cutting switchbacks through sandstone chutes, offering both the trail's first scenic overlooks and a peaceful interlude with nature, as most of the hiker's companions have been left behind at the falls. Rhododendron, sand myrtle, and mountain laurel blanket the trail during this portion, offering springtime visitors a beautiful carpeting of purples, whites, and blends of pink. At , the trail comes to Rocky Spur, an outcropping of rocks that offers splendid views of the valleys below via a short side trail which loops back to the main trail. As the hiker continues on, s/he enters into a fragrant spruce fir forest, which signals the looming junction with the Bullhead Trail, at . From that point, the now very rocky trail ascends for a half mile towards LeConte Lodge. The LeConte Lodge provides the only commercial lodging in the national park, as it operates about ten rustic cabins with no electricity or appliances. The lodge also operates an office which provides T-shirts and other merchandise for hikers and various amenities for guests of the lodge. For many, this signals the end of their journey, but the actual peaks of Le Conte all have separate trails a short distance from the lodge, with Cliff Tops and Myrtle Point each offering expansive panoramas of the mountains and valleys below.

Origins Originally formed as a left-wing congressional coalition, the party itself was officially founded on July 17, 2003. The congressional movement consisted of the union of diverse tendencies among the Colombian left (including former guerrillas, labor and union leaders, indigenous representatives and others), including many of, but not necessarily limited to, Marxist extraction. Some of the members of the original group which did not formally join the new party remained as members of separate political structures, one of which then founded Democratic Alternative (AD). Political platform The PDI's platform principally consisted of supporting a negotiated settlement with the country's leftwing insurgencies, defending the principles and practical applications of Colombia's 1991 Constitution, rejecting the country's traditionally bipartisan politics, and promoting democracy, freedom and social justice while also respecting human rights. The party completely rejected the armed struggle of the FARC and ELN as an effective means to solve Colombia's social, political and economical problems. Political development Despite threats and violent actions from elements of the country's radical right-wing, most notably from AUC paramilitaries and others, which have resulted in the murder of some of its members, the PDI has become a nationally recognized movement and it has enjoyed some recent electoral successes, such as winning the October 2003 election for the office of Bogot√°'s mayor through their candidate Luis Eduardo Garz√≥n, the governorship of the Valle del Cauca department through Angelino Garz√≥n, and being partially responsible for the failure of the government's October 2003 referendum (which it opposed, together with the Colombian Liberal Party and others). The party also became part of a few ruling coalitions in other local municipalities, such as Nari√±o, Pasto. The PDI was present as an observer in the Socialist International. The PDI was in political opposition to the government of president √Ålvaro Uribe, being critical of many of his actions and generally rejecting his policies as counter-productive or ineffective. This has not prevented several of its members from participating in discussions and finding points of agreement with some Uribe supporters or with other more traditional politicians. Ahead of the 2006 elections, the PDI and Democratic Alternative formed an alliance called Alternative Democratic Pole (PDA). The PDA chose AD's Carlos Gaviria D√≠az as its presidential candidate, defeating the PDI's Antonio Navarro Wolff in a close race.

He co-wrote The Contemporary Violin: Extended Performance Techniques with his wife, Patricia.http://www.scarecrowpress.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&db;=^DB/CATALOG.db&eqSKUdata;=0520224094 The Contemporary Violin: Extended Performance Techniques By Patricia Strange and Allen Strange. Scarecrow Press, Inc. (2001) Career Allen Strange studied composition with Donal Michalsky at the California State University, Fullerton. He received his MA in 1967. He later studied composition with Robert Erickson, Harry Partch, and Ken Gaburo, and electronic media with Pauline Oliveros at the University of California, San Diego from 1967-8 and 1970-71. In 1970, Strange became a professor of music and the director of the electronic music studios at San Jose State University. He received grants from the San Jose State University Foundation for research into electronic music. Other grant support came from the American Music Center, Yamaha Corporation and the BIAHC Foundation. He attended John Chowning's music seminar at the Stanford University Artificial Intelligence Center. Strange was one of the leading authorities on analogue electronic music; his book Electronic Music: Systems, Techniques, and Controls is now a classic text. He also wrote Programming and Meta-Programming the Electro-Organism, the operations manual for the Buchla Music Easel and documented the 200 Series synthesizers made by Buchla. He co-founded two performance groups: Biome (1967‚Äì72), in order to make use of the EMS Synthi; and, with Don Buchla in 1974, the Electric Weasel Ensemble. He was president of the International Computer Music Association from 1993‚Äì1998, and appeared as a guest artist-lecturer throughout the world. With his wife, Patricia, they published The Contemporary Violin: Extended Performance Techniques (Scarecrow Press). Strange composed for live electronic instrumental ensembles, for live and taped electronics with voices and acoustic instruments, and for the theater; most of his works for acoustic instruments require extended performance techniques. He was particularly interested in linear tuning systems (as in The Hairbreadth Ring Screamers, 1969, and Second Book of Angels, 1979), spatial distribution of sound (Heart of Gold, 1982, and Velocity Studies, 1983), the isolation of timbre as a musical parameter, and composing for groups of like instruments or voices. Elements of vaudeville, rock-and-roll, country-and-western music, and the guitar techniques of Les Paul are found in his works. His theater pieces employ various media including film, video, and lighting effects; he produced a series of such works in collaboration with the playwright and director Robert Jenkins, of which the most important are Jack and the Beanstalk (1979) and The Ghost Hour (1981), an audio drama. His later projects include works for solo and small ensembles (Three Short Stories, 2005), continuation of the Goddess Trilogy for solo violin (Goddess, 2003), works for electronic media with and without acoustic instruments (Quinault Cathedral, 2004 and Velocity Studies V: NGate, 2007), compositions for various chamber ensembles (Songs in Black, 2005, Another Fine Mess, 2006), works for orchestra (Bainbridge Sketches, 2006 and Brief Visits to Imaginary Places, 2007) and a complete evening of settings of poems by Eugene Field, The Cautionary Tales of Eugene Field, 2006-7). Strange retired from academia in 2002 and moved to Bainbridge Island, Washington to pursue a full-time career composing, concertizing with his wife,http://www.umbc.edu/news/2007/01/umbc_presents_spring_2007_musi.html UMBC Presents Spring 2007 Music Concert Season and working with his jazz trio, Cuv√©e.http://www.societyofcomposers.org/user/allenstrange.htmlAllen Strange Biography Society of Composers He died on February 20, 2008.

Algeria has a public health care system, which is accessible and free of charge to all citizens of Algeria. The public health care system is financed by the government of Algeria. Given Algeria's young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an intensive immunization programme and a policy which allows Algerian citizens health care for Hospitalisations, medicines and outpatient care free to all citizens of Algeria. Algeria became a member of the World Health Organization on November 8, 1962. Public healthcare system At the change of Algeria‚Äôs independence in 1962, The Algerian health care system was very minor consisting of 1 physician per 33,000 people, estimated 300 doctors in all and one trained paramedic per 40,000 people. The country has made major changes and progresses in its policies and systems in health care. From 1975 onward, the Algerian government introduced a free national health care system. Hospital treatment, medications, and outpatient care became free to all citizens of Algeria. The national medical insurance scheme covers 90% of the entire population. The Algerian government decided to invest in government run expansive health care centres and clinics instead of investing in expensive hospitals. The health care facilities and medical equipment varies in size depending on the size of local population. Remote areas tend to get more rudimentary medical services. The Algerian government had a 4-year plan from 2010‚Äì14, which was expected to spend ‚Ç¨5.7bn in health care which a majority of the fund directed in the establishment of over 1,500 health care facilities all over Algeria. by 2015 the Algerian government had allocated ‚Ç¨4.85bn to build 10 hospital and renovate old ones. The Algerian government is investing in human resources by creating 58,000 jobs in nursing, doctors and health care assistants. The Algerian government is dedicating increased funds into increasing the amount of resources that the health care sector needs to develop their new facilities. This funding will go into new medical equipment and improved hospital capacity capabilities.  Private health system  The private health sectors in Algeria is a non government run health care system which citizens must pay for their services. The private health care sector had developed quickly to fill the gaps that the government public health care system had left. Private medical care is very limited as their services are not covered by the public health care system and only a few Algerians can afford to pay out of pocket payments for their own medical treatments. Patients that seek to use the private health system will pay large amounts of out of pocket fees and enjoy quality of service that only a few can afford. A private health insurance system does not yet exist in Algeria. Private medical facilities are becoming more common in Algeria with in 2015, 250 private clinics operating with many more planned and being built.  Poverty and hunger  Algeria is emerging from a several year internal conflict that had effected the nation into deep poverty and unemployment in rural areas. The rural poverty is closely related to the lack of income and employment. Due to the poverty families in these rural areas find it hard to afford basic food needs. Since 1986 the United Nations WFP (world food Program) has helped provide basic food needs to the people in need in Algeria. The role of WFP's food assistance is to help the families and those who need help to meet basic food and nutritional needs. Dry food baskets provided consist of cereals (wheat flour, rice and barley), pulses (lentils, beans and chick peas), sugar, vegetable oil and blended food. The united nations WPA Algeria runs from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 with a total budget of $66 Million USD. WFP find it hard to find products for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition due to funding. Health statuses and issues  Life expectancy  According to the World Health Organization, life expectancy in Algeria in males was 70.3 years of age and females 73.5 with a total life expectancy of 71.8. Giving Algeria a world life expectancy ranking of 103. In 2020 Algeria's life expectancy increased with males having a life expectancy of 76.95 years of age and females 77.96 years of age. The total life expectancy being 76.59 years of age.  Smoking  45 people die every day in Algeria from serious diseases caused by smoking, according to Pr Salim Nafti, president of the Algerian Society of Pneumophtisiology, who works at the Mustapha Pacha hospital. Smoking is the main causes of 25 serious diseases with 90% of which are cancers. Every year more than 8700 people are killed by tobacco-caused rated diseases. More than 14,2000 children and more than 3,224,000 adults continue to use tobacco each day. The Algerian law has a lack of firmness on laws regarding on the sale and distribution of cigarettes with a lack of enforcement. In 2010, 11.2% males deaths and 1.3% female deaths were a result of a smoking-related death. With children smoking in Algeria, 18% more boys smoke in Algeria than the average in middle-income countries.  Diseases  Diabetes in Algeria has become a widespread severe health issue. Diabetes in Algeria has increased from 6.8% in 1990, 8.9% in 2003, 12.29% in 2005, 13.8% in 2010. Currently 10.5% in 2016 with 10.2% males and 10.7% females. In 2014 there were over 1.6 million cases of diabetes with 14,044 Adult deaths in Algeria. (International Diabetes Federation) It is predominantly most common in 35‚Äì70 year olds, which consist of a large segment of the working population. The transition from the traditional life style to a more westernised is one of the major explanatory factors behind the rapid progression of diabetes in Algeria.

Background Omodei was born in Manjimup, a town in the South West of Western Australia, and is of Italian ancestry. He attended St Joseph's School in Pemberton and worked as a potato farmer and horticulturalist in the area. He became a councillor for the Shire of Manjimup in 1977 and served as Shire President in 1983‚Äì1985 and 1987‚Äì1988. At the 1989 election, he won the previously safe Labor seat of Warren for the Liberal Party in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. In 1992, he became the Shadow Minister for Local Government. When the Liberals won power under Richard Court at the 1993 election, he became Minister for Local Government‚Äîa post he held for both of Court's terms of office‚Äîand Water Resources. In 1995, he moved from Water Resources to Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs. In 1996, he won the enlarged seat of Warren-Blackwood. In 1997, he added the Disability Services portfolio and in 1999 Forest Products. Following the defeat of the Court government at the 2001 election, Omodei held various shadow cabinet posts, including Local Government, Emergency Services and Regional Development. At the 2005 election, where Labor achieved a decisive victory, Colin Barnett resigned as leader of the party, and Matt Birney was elected in Barnett's stead, with Omodei elected deputy leader. He was forced to resign in October 2005 after he was convicted of unlawfully shooting his son during a rabbit cull. His son's thumb was shot after the gun accidentally went off while being loaded. An appeal against the conviction was dismissed.Omodei v The State of Western Australia News coverage during the latter part of Birney's time in office centred on an alleged breach of parliamentary disclosure rules and several gaffes. After a botched attempt to sack shadow attorney-general Sue Walker, a leadership spill was declared on 24 March 2006, which Omodei narrowly won after deputy leader Troy Buswell voted for him over Birney. In mid-2007, with increasingly hostile coverage from the state newspaper of record, The West Australian, and the Liberal Opposition's failure to make ground on any key issue against the Government despite a number of scandals, speculation emerged in the media that Omodei would be replaced as leader by his deputy, Troy Buswell after the Federal election on 24 November 2007. In December, Newspoll recorded Omodei's preferred premier rating as 13% against premier Alan Carpenter's 63%‚Äîranking as one of the lowest ever figures for an Opposition leader in Australia. In January 2008, Buswell announced he would challenge Omodei's leadership. After a spill motion carried in the Liberal party room on 17 January, Omodei did not contest the ensuring leadership spill, which was won by Buswell. After losing the leadership, Omodei sought preselection to move to the Legislative Council after boundary changes saw Warren-Blackwood becoming marginal when it merged with nearby Stirling held by the Nationals.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-02-18/liberal- party-defends-omodei-selection-process/1045744 Although preselected for the winnable second seat for the South West Legislative Council region, a State conference on 3 May 2008 lowered him to fourth place, and he subsequently announced his resignation from the Liberal Party. In his announcement, he stated that in his opinion, Buswell was \\"not a fit and proper person to lead the party\\". However, he did not make his resignation official until 19 June. Omodei expressed his outrage that as a former Liberal leader he had to struggle even to find a seat in the upper house in order to stay in Parliament.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-02-18/liberal-party-defends- omodei-selection-process/1045744 In 2017, he once again became President of the Shire of Manjimup.

M. Coetzee. The book is one of Coetzee's more experimental novels and is narrated through 266 numbered paragraphs rather than chapters. Plot The novel is narrated from the point of view of Magda, the white daughter of a widowed farmer in the Karoo semi-desert of the Western Cape. Much of the novel is narrated from within the claustrophobic confines of Magda's bedroom and throughout the narrative the unreliability of Magda's narration means the reader cannot be certain what is actually taking place and what is occurring within Magda's imagination. At the beginning of the novel Magda fantasizes about her father unexpectedly bringing home a young bride and the violent way that she would kill them both. A short while later the black farm worker Hendrik really does bring a young bride named Anna to the farm. Magda's father seduces Anna and when Magda hears her father and Anna fornicating in the farmhouse bedroom, she takes her father's rifle and shoots him in the stomach. He slowly dies of his injuries and Magda buries him in a makeshift crypt on the farmland. Gradually, without her father to manage the land, the food begins to run out and Hendrik, who is owed wages, demands to be paid. Magda pays him in kind by offering him certain items from her father's former possessions. Hendrik and Anna move into the farmhouse and the power balance begins to tip in their favour. After a series of altercations, Hendrik rapes Magda and begins to visit her room every night for sexual intercourse. When white men from nearby farms turn up looking for Magda's father, Hendrik and Anna flee fearing that they will blamed for his death. The novel ends with Magda isolated on the farm, slowly starving and seemingly going mad, as she tries to communicate with the planes that are beginning to fly over the desert every day. Development history Coetzee has stated that the 'brief sequences' that narrate the novel are fundamentally influenced by filmic and photographic modes of representation. He cites Chris Marker's La Jet√©e and Andrzej Munk's Passenger as particular influences. Moreover, Coetzee explains that the numbered paragraphs should act like film scenes in that they point to 'what is not there between them'.Coetzee, J.M. 'Interview.' Doubling The Point: Essays and Interviews. Edited by David Attwell. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992. pp.57-69, p.59 There are three versions of the novel in existence: the 1977 British version, the 1977 American version which was the same but published under the title From The Heart Of The Country, and the 1978 South African version.

The band is seen playing inside. The first minute of the video makes it evident that the SWAT team is there to arrest the band for speaking the Word of God. At the chorus, lead singer Jon Micah Sumrall goes to the roof of the building, and yells the words of the chorus through a megaphone down to the policemen below. The SWAT team continues to fan out and look for the band members, who are shown at various times connecting wires and looking out of windows.

The band members are shown playing/singing one at a time during various shots, and they are foreground in black and white. The images are shown with various flashes of static over many of the shots. The song's meaning is displayed very well in the video, because lead singer Jon Micah Sumrall has said that he enjoys living for every single day, and he does that a lot with extreme sports.

The latter school has undergone several organisational changes during that time, however, notably from District High School to High School. In mid-October 2006, it celebrated its 150th anniversary.\\"Romahapa School 150th Jubilee 1856-2006\\", Education Gazette New Zealand 85(16) [18 September 2006].  Railway  On 15 December 1885, a branch line railway (the Catlins Branch Line) from the Main South Line in Balclutha was opened to Romahapa. The village became a railway terminus for a few years and a number of bush tramways also operated in the area during the 1890s. Romahapa lost its terminal status on 7 July 1891 when an extension opened to Glenomaru.New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition, edited by John Yonge (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 28. The railway line came to be known as the Catlins River Branch and ultimately terminated in Tahakopa; it serviced Romahapa until its closure on 27 February 1971. In the early 1900s, up to sixteen trains ran through Romahapa a week; these were predominantly mixed trains.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 103-4. Today, the Romahapa station's goods shed remains in its old location, while the station building has been resited a few kilometres away, and the wooden railway bridge over the Romahapa Creek still stands.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 104-5.

The recording starts with some brief background ambiance of a cocktail party, before launching into the song. Whilst the basic backing track of guitar, acoustic piano, bass guitar, tenor saxophone and drums is relatively straightforward and traditional in form, other elements of the arrangement are quite bizarre and futuristic: Eno plays continual squalls of atonal oscillator noise using Andy MacKay's VCS3 synthesizer, whilst Ferry's lead vocal style is strikingly distraught and anguished in tone. The lead guitar and saxophone solos in the middle of the song also tend to cacophony. In the song, each instrument is allowed a short solo break in turn; the sax mimics the trumpets from Richard Wagner's opera \\"the Valkyrie\\" and the bass guitar solo mimics the riff from the Beatles song \\"Day Tripper\\". Phil Manzanera's guitar part reverses the usual guitar pattern: he plays single-note lead guitar all through the song, with no chords, but his solo break consists only of chords. The lyrics describe a man that likes the look of a woman, but is afraid to approach her. Ferry explained in an interview that Eno and MacKay's backing vocal chorus of \\"CPL 593H\\" was the number plate of the car in which the woman is riding.Ian MacDonald. \\"Party fun from an old poseur\\", NME, 8 September 1973 On his way to the recording studio, Ferry had seen a beautiful woman riding a car with this number plate, and decided to use it in a song. Ferry reworked Re-Make/Re-Model on his Let's Stick Together album (1976). The song was covered by Frank Black on his Oddballs collection of B-sides and rarities and he performed it live while touring with The Catholics. The song was performed in concert by Scott Miller's band The Loud Family, and Portland post-punk band Glass Candy released a cover of the song (titled \\"Nueva Version/Remodela\\") as the B-side to their 2003 single \\"Bicicleta Emocional.\\" Other versions of the song also appear on several of their tour CD-Rs.

He was one of the most important Roman Catholic apologists of the 19th century. Biography He was born in Cardeto, a small town in the province of Reggio Calabria, in the deepest south of Italy. He studied at the local seminary and soon became famous for his skills in different subjects: Latin, Greek, theology, history, moral theology and dogmatics. He moved to Rome for further study and in 1864, was ordained a priest. He stayed in Rome for more than 40 years, until his death in 1906. He wrote about 200 works in different languages on a wide range of topics, including: theology, ecclesiastical history, apologetics as well as poetry in Greek, Latin and Italian. Originally a Jesuit, he left the order in 1865 and was subsequently appointed to a series of important positions in the Church. In 1868, he was appointed Privy chamberlain and beneficiary of the patriarchal Lateran basilica. In 1878 he was appointed Canon of San Lorenzo in Damaso, Rome and, the following year, of San Giovanni in Laterano basilica. In 1885 he was named canon of St. Peter's. His following appointments include: prelate referendary of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura (1883); secretary of the Commission for Historical Studies (1884); prefect of the archive of the Holy See (1892); secretary of the Congregation of Rites (1894); Substitute of the Secretariat of State (1896). He was created Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica by Pope Leo XIII on 15 April 1901. He was later also prefect of the S.C. Indulgencies and Sacred Relics, president of the Academy of the Catholic Religion and pro-prefect of the S.C. of Rites. Tripepi died in Rome in 1906. He was buried in the chapel of the chapter of the Vatican Basilica in the Campo Verano Cemetery, Rome. In October 1993 his remains were moved to Mallemace, near Cardeto, and placed in a little mausoleum named after him and built close to a famous sanctuary dedicated to the Holy Mother of Jesus, Madonna Assunta di Mallemace, to whom he was devoted since childhood.

Metropolitan Philaret (secular name Vasily Mikhaylovich Drozdov, –í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏–π –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á –î—Ä–æ–∑–¥–æ–≤; 26 December 1782 ‚Äì 1 December 1867) was Metropolitan of Moscow and Kolomna and the most influential figure in the Russian Orthodox Church for more than 40 years, from 1821 to 1867. He was canonized on 13 October 1994 and his feast day is celebrated on November 19. Life He was born in Kolomna as Vasily Drozdov (). His father was a member of the clergy. Vasily was educated at the seminary of Kolomna, where courses were taught in Latin; and then at the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, and on the completion of his studies was at once appointed professor in the latter. He became preacher of the lavra in 1806, and in 1808, received the monastic tonsure and was named Philaret after Saint Philaret the Merciful.\\"Repose of St Philaret (Drozdov) the Metropolitan of Moscow\\", Orthodox Church in America In 1809 he was appointed professor of theology in the ecclesiastical academy of Alexander Nevsky Lavra in St. Petersburg, becoming archimandrite in 1811 and director in 1812. The Events of 1812 produced a strong impression on Philaret; he explained the success of the Russians by moral reason and read a lecture on this theme in the \\"Society of friends of the Russian word\\". In 1813 he declaimed his famous speech on Kutuzov's death. He took monastic vows in 1817, and was soon consecrated bishop of Reval\\"St. Philaret of Moscow\\", Pravoslavie, December 2, 2016 and then episcopal vicar of St. Petersburg. In 1819, he became Archbishop of Tver and a member of the Most Holy Synod. In the following year he was archbishop of Yaroslavl, and in 1821 was translated to Moscow, also becoming metropolitan in 1826. His daring utterances, however, brought him into imperial disfavor from 1845 until the accession of Alexander II. In 1855 he was restricted to the limits of his diocese. He is said to have prepared Alexander's proclamation freeing the serfs, and he enjoyed the reputation of being one of the leading pulpit orators of his time and country. He was the spiritual father of missionary hieromonk Macarius (Glukharyov) (1792‚Äì1847), canonized in 2000 for his role as \\"Apostle to the Altai\\". Philaret was responsible for some of the worst offences towards the Old Believers, including the misappropriation of churches and the sealing of the altars at the churches of the Rogozhskoye Cemetery, which was the administrative and spiritual center of the Belokrinitskoe Soglasie Old Believers. Philaret was also directly involved in the imprisonment of Old Believer hierarchs and monastics. Works Filaret was a prominent figure in preparing a Russian translation of the Bible (until his time, only a Church Slavonic version not readily understood by the general populace was available), and wrote many volumes of theological and historical works collectively known as the Filaretica. They include the Colloquy between a Believer and a Skeptic on the True Doctrine of the Greco-Russian Church (St. Petersburg, 1815); Compend of Sacred History (1816); Commentary on Genesis (1816); Attempt to Explain Psalm lxvii. (1818); Sermons delivered at Various Times (1820); Extracts from the Four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles for Use in Lay Schools (1820); Christian Catechism (1823); Extracts from the Historical Books of the Old Testament (1828‚Äì30); Principles of Religious Instruction (1828); and New Collection of Sermons (1830‚Äì36).

It is a synthetic, water-soluble analog of the natural chemical compound camptothecin. It is used in the form of its hydrochloride salt to treat ovarian cancer, lung cancer and other cancer types. After GlaxoSmithKline received final FDA approval for Hycamtin Capsules on October 15, 2007, topotecan became the first topoisomerase I inhibitor for oral use. Uses * Ovarian cancer (FDA May 1996). * Cervical cancer (FDA June 2006). * Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (FDA Oct 2007). Experimental uses As of 2016 experiments were under way for Neuroblastoma, Brainstem glioma, Ewing's sarcoma and Angelman's syndrome. In addition, topotecan is experimentally treating Non-small cell lung cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Breast cancer, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Endometrial cancer, and Oligodendroglioma.  Angelman's syndrome  Angelman's syndrome is a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by severe developmental delays, seizures, speech impairments and physical impairments. It is an epigenetic disease and other treatments focus on symptoms. It is caused by a deletion or mutation of the maternal allele for the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A.(Huang et al) UBE3A is expressed in most body tissues. However, in neurons only the maternal copy of the gene is expressed. UBE3A is located on chromosome 15 and the paternal copy for the gene is genetically imprinted and is silenced by an antisense RNA transcript. The maternal copy control center of the gene is methylated, suppressing transcription in the antisense direction while the paternal copy control center is unmethylated. Treatment involves unsilencing the paternal allele allowing the normal paternal UBE3A allele to be transcribed. UBE3A, in normal function, adds ubiquitin chains to proteins to target unnecessary or damaged proteins for degradation by the proteasome. 16 topoisomerase inhibitors unsilence paternal UBE3A. Topoisomerases are enzymes that regulate the unwinding of DNA.(Miller) Of these 16 inhibitors, topotecan was found to induce the strongest upregulation of UBE3A. The enzymes bind to the DNA and cut the phosphate backbone, allowing the DNA to be unwound. Topotecan unsilences the paternal UBE2A allele by reducing the transcription of an antisense transcript. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase I restoring UBE3A levels to wild-type range in cultured mince neurons. Transgenic mice with a fluorescently tagged UBE3A were used to test the effectiveness of unsilencing the paternal copy. When tested on mice in vivo, topotecan affected the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex but not the cerebellum unless a higher dose was administered (21.6 micrograms/hour for five days). The study suggested that the topoisomerase inhibitors have the potential to produce a normally functioning UBE3A protein. Most symptoms due to Angelman's syndrome are traditionally treated by speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Anti-seizure medication is often prescribed as seizures are a common symptom of Angelman's syndrome.(Aditi and Williams) These treatments target only symptoms. This drug has been administered to cancer patients. It was well tolerated when administered to pediatric and adult patients. Mechanism of action Topotecan is a semi-synthetic derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecin is a natural product extracted from the bark of the tree Camptotheca acuminata. Topoisomerase-I is a nuclear enzyme that relieves torsional strain in DNA by opening single strand breaks. Once topoisomerase-I creates a single strand break, the DNA can rotate in front of the advancing replication fork. In physiological environments, topotecan is in equilibrium with its inactive carboxylate form. Topotecan's active lactone form intercalates between DNA bases in the topoisomerase-I cleavage complex. The binding of topotecan in the cleavage complex prevents topoisomerase-I from religating the nicked DNA strand after relieving the strain. This intercalation therefore traps the topoisomerase-I in the cleavage complex bound to the DNA. When the replication-fork collides with the trapped topoisomerase-I, DNA damage occurs. The unbroken DNA strand breaks and mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks. The accumulation of trapped topoisomerase-I complexes is a known response to apoptotic stimuli. This disruption prevents DNA replication and ultimately leads to cell death. This process leads to breaks in the DNA strand resulting in apoptosis. Administration of topotecan down-regulates its target, topoisomerase-I; therefore, it is dosed to maximize efficacy and minimize related toxicity. Topotecan is often given in combination with Paclitaxel as first line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.

History Originally activated as 3rd Battalion, 10th Marines on 1 January 1941 and armed with 75mm Pack Howitzers; the battalion now known as \\"the Steel Rain Battalion\\" fired the opening artillery rounds of the first U.S. offensive of World War II on 7 August 1942 against a Japanese sniper position on Guadalcanal. After earning two Presidential Unit Citations for service on Guadalcanal and Tarawa, the battalion briefly switched designations to 5th Battalion, 10th Marines. Six weeks later, the battalion transitioned to 155mm howitzers and was renamed the 2D 155mm Howitzer Battalion, a designation carried through the campaign for Saipan where they fired over 10,000 rounds, Guam where their displacements outpaced even the more nimble 75mm guns, and Iwo Jima where the battalion landed on D+1. The battalion was deactivated in 1945, and its guns remained silent until 1954 when it was re-activated. With the exception of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where our Marines supported the blockade that forced the Soviet Union to remove its missiles from Cuba, the Steel Rain Battalion did not see action again until the Gulf War. The battalion was re-designated 5th Battalion, 10th Marines, 2d Marine Division in 1978 and served as the division's general support artillery battalion. During Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm from December 1990 to April 1991, the Marines of 5/10 manned 8\\" and 155mm self-propelled howitzers and supported the division during the liberation of Kuwait. Since 1991, 5/10 has distinguished itself during service in Haiti in 1994 and by supporting the ongoing War on Terrorism through service as provisional infantry, civil affairs, training foreign militaries, and providing artillery fire support to the coalition forces in Iraq. The battalion most recently served as the Brigade Headquarters Group for 2d Marine Expeditionary Brigade while deployed to Southern Afghanistan. The battalion was deployed as a Civil Affairs Group in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2007. The battalion was part of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade in support of Operation Enduring Freedom that deployed in Spring 2009, and returned in spring of 2010, from the Helmand Provinence in southern Afghanistan.

A live version appears on their Viva! live album. Song structure and themes The song begins in a rather light-hearted, jaunty fashion, a slight pastiche of country music, with honky tonk style piano and twangy guitar. Ferry's singing is nonchalant and jocular. However the mood of the song builds with a repeated instrumental motif played between guitar and saxophone, Ferry's vocals re-entering to provide a fraught vocal climax. The instrumental motifs then return, often featuring Andy Mackay, before finally giving way to an emotional end section where Ferry's impassioned and melancholy vocals are set on top of a lush blend of backing vocals and the mellotron \\"three violins\\" tape set. It has been said that the first part of the song is a youth wondering about love, the second part adults in the heat of passion and the third part the singer in old age thinking about their past love. Live performances The song was played on all the early Roxy Music tours and the instrumental passages were extended greatly, increasing the length of the song from 6:34 to sometimes over 12 minutes. On 18 February 1972, the BBC sessions aired a performance of over 11 minutes. During the Country Life tour the song was also performed, and the performance at Newcastle City Hall on 27 or 28 October 1974 was used for the 1976 live album Viva!. After 1975 however, the song was no longer played until the Roxy Music Reunion tour in 2001. A live version from this tour appears on the \\"Live\\" album.

History While being profiled in a PBS documentary, it was suggested to Farlow that he be paired with a younger jazz guitarist. He suggested Breau and the two guitarists performed this set at a small nightclub in Rumson, New Jersey. It was their first and only performance together. Reception In his review for Allmusic, music critic Ken Dryden wrote the musicians \\"complement one another's playing as if they had worked as a regular duo. Breau, on his seven-string guitar, is a bundle of energy most of the time, with flurries of notes accompanied by his flawless rhythm. Of course, the senior player is no slouch as a soloist on any of the eight standards heard on this CD... It's too bad that this enjoyable session was only a one- time affair.\\" In reviewing the release for JazzTimes, critic Jim Ferguson wrote \\"The mutual admiration between the players is obvious throughout the nine impromptu performances,... More than sophisticated chordal structures and harmonics, the thing that these two geniuses-a generation apart-really have in common is the music, which eloquently speaks for itself.\\" Track listing #\\"I Love You\\" (Cole Porter) ‚Äì 5:24 #\\"Satin Doll\\" (Duke Ellington) ‚Äì 7:03 #\\"My Funny Valentine\\" (Lorenz Hart, Richard Rodgers) ‚Äì 8:40 #\\"All the Things You Are\\" (Oscar Hammerstein II, Jerome Kern) ‚Äì 11:33 #\\"Conversation\\" (Farlow, Breau) ‚Äì 2:34 #\\"Cherokee\\" (Ray Noble, Peter Maurice) ‚Äì 4:30 #\\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\\" (Porter) ‚Äì 6:56 #\\"Broadway\\" (Wilbur Bird, Teddy McRae, Henri Woode) ‚Äì 6:03 #\\"My Foolish Heart\\" (Ned Washington, Victor Young) ‚Äì 7:00 Personnel *Tal Farlow ‚Äì guitar *Lenny Breau ‚Äì guitar *Lyn Christie ‚Äì bass on \\"All the Things You Are\\" and \\"Cherokee\\" *Nat Garratano ‚Äì drums on \\"All the Things You Are\\" and \\"Cherokee\\" Production notes: *Randy Bachman ‚Äì executive producer *John Dildine ‚Äì engineer References External links *Guitarchives web site Category:Lenny Breau albums Category:Tal Farlow albums Category:1998 live albums Category:Collaborative albums ","title":"Chance Meeting (album)"},{"id":"4498025","text":"1988 Cadillac Brougham. Large vehicles such as the Brougham have become stereotypical \\"old man's cars\\" due to their appeal to older consumers. Lincoln Town Car. Before ending production in 2011, approximately ninety percent of Town Car buyers were over the age of 65. An old man's car (or old person's car or old folk's car) is stereotype of a car that appeals to older buyers rather than to younger ones. It is widely held in the United States automobile industry that such cars are difficult to sell. Several automobile manufacturers have taken steps to shake the perception that their cars are intended for an older generation because it tarnishes the brand's image in the eyes of younger buyers. Two automobile company executives are associated with the adage that \\"You can sell a young man's car to an old man, but you cannot sell an old man's car to a young man.\\" Lynn Townsend, who became president of Chrysler in 1961, and Semon Knudsen who became General Manager of Pontiac in July 1956. Knudsen espoused this philosophy during the changes that he made to Pontiac from 1957 to 1959, which began with the release of the Bonneville, intended to be a high profile announcement to the U.S. public that Pontiac was \\"no longer an old man's car company\\". Townsend had two teenage sons, who, according to Hoover (the engineering coordinator for the engineering division for the race programme in 1961), when Townsend took on the position of president \\"made it known to dad straightaway that this stuff was nowhere. He was highly sensitive to the fact that the product line was nowhere out there with the young people.\\". Townsend used this rationale in his directive to change the image of the product line in October 1961. Ford employed this adage in its advertising for the Ford Focus in the United States. One advertisement showed a group of youths climbing out of the rear of the car after having pulled into a parking space too narrow for them to open the side doors. Another showed a similar group of youths nervously holding coffee cups as the car passed over a series of railway tracks. Mueller observes that Ford \\"could just as easily have demonstrated the ease of entry or exit for a cane user [...] or a number of other features especially useful for drivers with limitations due to age or disability\\", but chose not to because that would be attempting to sell features that appeal to older people to young people, whereas the campaign that Ford went with actually sold features that appeal to younger people to both younger and older people. Similarly, whilst most buyers of Honda cars are in the 40 to 60 age range, the advertising for the cars \\"portrays youthful activities and targets a youth mindset\\" (in the words of American Honda's national advertising manager). Oldsmobile automobiles had, by the 1990s, long been branded as \\"old man's cars\\" and \\"Buick clones\\". John Rock became the chief executive in 1992, and by January 1993 was implementing a strategy to bring in younger buyers that comprised (in Rock's words) \\"throw[ing] out old brands and creat[ing] new ones\\" and becoming more \\"Saturn- like\\". (In a 2006 interview, Robert Lutz, vice-chairman of General Motors said that for the Saturn \\"you don't have to overcome preconceived public notions\\", whereas the fact that Buick \\"is an old person's car is a notion that's constantly reinforced by the media\\", making it easier to grow a brand like Saturn.) One part of doing so was an advertising campaign aimed at shedding the old man's car preconception, involving the slogan \\"This is not your father's Oldsmobile.\\" Kassof states that the advertising campaign was a flop, and further opines that it may indeed have backfired, reinforcing and even introducing the old man's car preconception in the minds of those people who had not previously thought of Oldsmobile vehicles as being such. GM eventually successfully courted younger buyers with the Buick brand, following the phaseout of Oldsmobile in 2004 and the phaseout of Saturn and Pontiac in 2010 after GM's bankruptcy.

Kang is voiced by Harry Shearer and Kodos by Dan Castellaneta. They are green, octopus-like aliens from the fictional planet Rigel VII and appear almost exclusively in the \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" episodes. The duo has appeared in at least one segment of all thirty Treehouse of Horror episodes. Sometimes their appearance is the focus of a plot, other times a brief cameo. Kang and Kodos are often bent on the conquest of Earth and are usually seen working on sinister plans to invade and subjugate humanity. The duo first appeared in season two's \\"Treehouse of Horror\\". The first drawing of Kang and Kodos came from writers Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. The finished design was based on an EC Comics issue cover. Kang and Kodos had brief cameo appearances in several non-\\"Treehouse of Horror\\" episodes and have appeared as villains in several of The Simpsons video games. Role in The Simpsons Speaking \\"Rigellian\\", which coincidentally sounds exactly like English, Kang and Kodos are Rigellians from the planet Rigel VII. Virtually identical in appearance, wearing breathing helmets, one of the few distinguishing characteristics is the duo's voices as Kang's is deeper. In most appearances they are antagonistic towards humanity. One exception is Kang and Kodos's first appearance in segment \\"Hungry are the Damned\\" of the episode \\"Treehouse of Horror\\", where they capture the Simpson family and feed them exquisite cuisine. Lisa becomes suspicious of their intentions and accuses Kang and Kodos of wanting to eat the Simpson family. Kang and Kodos deny this accusation and are outraged. Afterwards both take the Simpsons back to Earth. Kang and Kodos have invaded the Earth on several occasions, with varying results. In 1996, Kang and Kodos impersonated Bill Clinton and Bob Dole and ran against each other in the 1996 election. At first, Americans declared they would vote for a third party candidate, but Kang convinced them that the option would be a waste of a vote. As a result, Kang was elected president. In their second appearance, they decided to take over the Earth after citizens had declared world peace, but ultimately failed. Kang and Kodos's religion is \\"Quantum Presbyterianism\\", although Kodos later claims to be Jewish. Other Rigellians that have appeared include Serak the Preparer, who was voiced by James Earl Jones and only appeared in \\"Treehouse of Horror\\". Kang and Kodos have appeared in every \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" episode to date, and have played major roles in \\"Treehouse of Horror I\\", \\"Treehouse of Horror II\\", \\"Treehouse of Horror VII\\", \\"Treehouse of Horror IX\\", \\"Treehouse of Horror XVII\\", \\"Treehouse of Horror XVIII\\". \\" Treehouse of Horror XXII, and \\"Treehouse of Horror XXX\\". The rest of their appearances were cameos, although both appeared in the opening segment of \\"Treehouse of Horror X\\", \\"Treehouse of Horror XIV\\", \\"Treehouse of Horror XV\\" and \\"Treehouse of Horror XVI\\". Kang and Kodos's cameo appearances normally occur in the midst of segments, which will suddenly cut away to the duo. For example, Kang and Kodos observe zombies attacking Earth from space. The duo laugh maniacally at the Earthlings' suffering, before the scene is switched back from space to Earth. Kang and Kodos have made rare appearances in non-\\"Treehouse of Horror\\" episodes, such as \\"Behind the Laughter\\" and \\"Gump Roast\\", and had a non- speaking cameo in \\"The Springfield Files\\" on a line-up with other aliens. Also, the duo can be seen in the crowd flyby during the updated HD opener. In the episode \\"The Man Who Came to Be Dinner\\", Kang and Kodos have one of their few canon appearances. The Simpsons end up on Rigel VII where Kang and Kodos give them a tour and a brief look at their lifecycle before placing them in a zoo with one of them, Homer, to be eaten in a yearly ritual. But after it is revealed that human consumption is fatal to their kind due to their unhealthy diet, their queen killed as a result, the Rigellans send the Simpsons back to Earth.TVGuide.com ‚Äì Keck's Exclusives: The Simpsons in Space In one Treehouse of Horror episode, Marge announces Kang to be Maggie's father, the result of an experiment to breed two different species. Characters Creation Harry Shearer, the voice of Kang Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Kodos Kang and Kodos first appeared in the second season in \\"Treehouse of Horror\\". The idea of Kang and Kodos came from Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, writers of \\"Hungry are the Damned\\". In the script, Kang and Kodos were shown as \\"an octopus in a space helmet with a trail of goo\\". The finished design was based on EC Comics cover issue. Although originally designed to constantly drool, Matt Groening suggested that they not drool all the time to make the animation process easier. However, the animators did not mind the work, leading to the drooling staying in the script. Kang and Kodos's names are derived from two Star Trek characters. Kang was a Klingon captain portrayed by actor Michael Ansara in \\"Day of the Dove\\", whereas Kodos the Executioner was a human villain from \\"The Conscience of the King\\". Harry Shearer voices Kang, and Dan Castellaneta voices Kodos. An unofficial rule for the writers is that Kang and Kodos must appear in every Halloween episode. Despite this rule, the writers say the duo will often be forgotten and are added at the last second, leading to brief appearances. Development Traditionally, Kang and Kodos appeared in every single Treehouse of Horror episode as a part of a story's plotline or as cameos. They almost did not make the cut in \\"Treehouse of Horror VIII\\", but David X. Cohen managed to persuade the producers to keep the scene. Kang however didn't appear in Treehouse of Horror XXI. Kang and Kodos were originally going to make regular appearances in the show. One idea was only Homer would be able to see them and everyone else thinking Homer is crazy when he talked about the aliens. However the concept was \\"too far out\\", leading to characters only featured in the \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" specials. In some appearances, Kang and Kodos will laugh hysterically for several seconds. This was suggested by Sam Simon. During production, the episodes would often be too short; so to make more time, their laughter was lengthened. Kodos' gender has come into debate from fans. In \\"Treehouse of Horror VII\\", Kang introduces Kodos with \\"This is my sister Kodos\\". The line was pitched by George Meyer and was even somewhat followed in later episodes as the writers tried to make Kang the more dominant of the two. In previous and subsequent episodes, Kodos has been referred to as a male. In The Simpsons: Tapped Out video game, Kodos, but not Kang, is sent on a mission that only female characters are allowed to complete. In the Futurama crossover episode \\"Simpsorama\\", Kang and Kodos, referred to as \\"the Johnsons\\", visit recurring Futurama characters Lrrr and Ndnd for dinner in the 31st century, and both identify themselves as female. In an interview after the episode aired, producer Al Jean confirmed that Kang and Kodos Johnson are \\"a gay female couple in their species\\". Other appearances Kang & Kodos Twirl n Hurl, Universal Studios Florida Kang and Kodos have appeared in several different The Simpsons video games. The duo appear in The Simpsons: Road Rage ending, and Kang appears as the final boss character in The Simpsons Wrestling game. Kang and Kodos appear in cut scenes as the main villains 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run. In an attempt to collect new material for their failing reality TV show, Foolish Earthlings, Kang and Kodos plan to drug Springfield with a mind-control serum distributed through their \\"New and Improved Buzz Cola\\" product. After drinking the cola, the brainwashed people performed stupid stunts under the watchful view of wasp- like surveillance cameras, all for the sake of better ratings. They also appeared as villains in The Simpsons Game along with an army of other Rigellians, but like Hit & Run Kang and Kodos only appear in cutscenes. In The Simpsons Tapped Out, Kang was a premium Character for 2012 Halloween, and Kodos followed in the 2013 Halloween. In 2001, Kang and Kodos were made into separate action figures in the World of Springfield toy line. Along with their spaceship, Kang and Kodos were included with the \\"Treehouse of Horror II\\" set exclusive to Toys-R-Us. The two also have a brief cameo in The Simpsons Ride. In 2013, a separate ride called Kang & Kodos' Twirl 'n' Hurl was added in the vicinity of The Simpsons Ride in Universal Studios Florida park. In 2009, Kang and Kodos were also made into 6\\" collectible vinyl art toys by Kidrobot x The Simpsons. Kang was sculpted salivating and included an accessory book \\"How to Cook for Forty Humans\\". Kodos was the chase figure in the release, and the accessory included was a space gun. Both have been released again by Kidrobot x The Simpsons for The Treehouse of Horrors 3\\" Blind Box release along with 10 other characters from the Treehouse series in September 2013. Reception Several of the \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" episodes featuring the duo have been well received. In 2006, James Earl Jones, voice of Serak the Preparer in \\"Treehouse of Horror\\", was named seventh on IGN's \\"Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances\\" list. Jones also appeared on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars. \\"Treehouse of Horror VII\\" is Simpsons creator Matt Groening's seventh favorite episode. Groening's favorite line from the episode is from Kodos; \\"We have reached the limits of what rectal probing can teach us.\\" In 2006, IGN.com published a list of the top ten Treehouse of Horror segments, and several segments that feature Kang and Kodos were placed, including \\"Hungry Are The Damned\\", \\"Citizen Kang\\" and \\"Starship Poopers\\".

Early military units Calgary has had an active military garrison since the early years of the 20th century. Strathcona's Horse, a Permanent Force cavalry unit, had one squadron quartered in the city for many years. A local Non-Permanent Active Militia regiment was finally raised after several attempts by Lieutenant-Colonel William C.G. Armstrong, when the 103rd Regiment \\"Calgary Rifles\\" was authorized on 1 April 1910. Units of the artillery, engineers and supporting corps also had units in Calgary. First World War CEF battalions who trained near Signal Hill left a visible mark on the city at Battalion Park In 1914, several battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force were raised in Calgary, notably the 10th and 50th. Training took place at nearby Sarcee Camp, which grew enormously during the First World War. The camp later became known as Sarcee Training Area. Nearby Battalion Park overlooks this area. Militia reorganization In 1920‚Äì21, the Canadian military was reorganized, and the 103rd Regiment was split into two separate regiments, and by 1939 these were known as The Calgary Highlanders and the Calgary Regiment (Tank). Other supporting units remained in the city as well.

The Calgary Highlanders mobilized on 1 September 1939 and joined the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, moving to Shilo, Manitoba, in the summer of 1940 on the way to overseas employment. A 2nd Battalion was raised and served as a part-time Militia unit throughout the war. The Highlanders returned to Calgary on 24 November 1945 to a warm welcome, along with the 23rd Anti-Tank Battery (a component of the 2nd Anti-Tank Regiment) and the 91st Field Battery, Royal Canadian Artillery. The Calgary Regiment (Tank) mobilized in 1941 and eventually served in 1st Canadian Army Tank Brigade (later 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade), most famously serving at Dieppe but later being reconstituted and fighting in Sicily, Italy, and Northwest Europe. A reserve unit remained in Calgary. As well, a contingent of the Alberta University Canadian Officers Training Corps was located in the city. Post-war By the end of the Second World War, a greatly enlarged Regular Force saw a sizable military garrison located in Calgary, and regular battalions of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, as well as Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), were quartered in the city. In 1995, the Regular Force garrison ‚Äì including Strathcona's, 1 PPCLI, 1 Service Battalion, 1 Military Police Platoon, and the headquarters of Land Force Western Area as well as 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group ‚Äì all moved to Edmonton, leaving a skeleton staff of regular personnel in Calgary to administer the local Militia units. Permanent military facilities were completed in 1917 with the construction of Mewata Armouries, which then housed reserve units and a squadron of regular cavalry. Currie Barracks became an important training base during the Second World War, and many British Commonwealth Air Training Plan facilities were located in and around the city, including what is today the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. Currie Barracks, and nearby Harvey Barracks, were both developed after the war to form Canadian Forces Base Calgary (CFB Calgary). A second armoury was built in a Northeast Calgary industrial park in the 1980s. Harvey Barracks (and the adjacent Sarcee Training Area) were returned to the Tsuu T ºina Nation after the lease expired, and CFB Calgary was closed. Only the headquarters for a reserve brigade and a small area support unit remain. Current units Despite the closing of CFB Calgary (including both the Currie Barracks and Harvey Barracks), the city is still home to a significant military presence of Naval and Army Reserve units including: *, a Naval Reserve unit, and HMCS Tecumseh Band at the HMCS Tecumseh Building located at 1820 24 Street SW. *Mewata Armoury, an Army Reserve barracks located at 801 11 St SW. *General Sir Arthur Currie Building, an Army Reserve barracks located at 4225 Crowchild Trail SW.

Rules   Basics  During 12 rounds, players bid with cards on up to six different prizes each turn. Those prizes earn points in themselves, but players can also get points for connecting provinces on the map. After the twelfth round, the player with the highest point total wins the game.  Auctions  During the auction phase of the game, players take turns playing cards from their hands to increase the amount of their bid. A player may choose to withdraw instead of increasing their bid, in which case they immediately collect any awards they have earned for that round, and are removed from the auction.

He played collegiate basketball at Minot State University in North Dakota from 1980‚Äì1984, where he was a four-year letterman and a team captain for two seasons. He received his degree in physical education in 1985. Giacoletti was previously the head coach at North Dakota State University, Eastern Washington University, and the University of Utah. At Utah, he was a finalist for the Naismith Coach of the Year Award in 2005, he was also named the 2005 Playboy National Coach of the Year. Giacoletti resigned as Drake coach on December 6, 2016. Coaching history Born in Peoria, Illinois, Giacoletti began coaching in 1984 when he was named a student assistant coach at Minot State while finishing up his degree. Giacoletti then became a graduate assistant at Western Illinois University during the 1985‚Äì86 season. After spending a year at Western Illinois, Giacoletti became an assistant coach for Oral Roberts University during the 1986‚Äì87 season. After 3 seasons at the collegiate level, Giacoletti moved to the professional ranks, where he spent two seasons as an assistant coach for the Fresno Flames of the old World Basketball League. Giacoletti then returned to college coaching in the 1989 season, where he was named an assistant head coach under Bob Bender at Illinois State. After three seasons with Illinois State, Bender was named the head coach of the University of Washington, where Giacoletti accepted an assistant position with the program. He was an assistant coach with the Washington Huskies from 1993‚Äì1997, until he accepted the head coaching job at North Dakota State. By accepting the head coaching job at North Dakota State, Giacoletti returned to the state where he spent his collegiate years. In his first season as a head coach, Giacoletti guided North Dakota State to an 18‚Äì9 (.667) record. In his second season, North Dakota State finished with a 14‚Äì13 record and in his third season as coach, they went 16‚Äì11. Giacoletti would then leave North Dakota State for the head coaching job at Eastern Washington University. His final overall record at North Dakota State was 48‚Äì33. In 2000 Giacoletti was named the head coach of the Eastern Washington Eagles. He would guide the Eagles to their best four year stretch in program history. Giacoletti would compile a 69‚Äì50 (.580) record as head coach at Eastern Washington, including a 41‚Äì17 (.707) record in Big Sky Conference play. In his third season as head coach of Eastern Washington, Giacoletti led the Eagles to an 18‚Äì13 record and the school's first post season tournament in school history, making the 2003 National Invitation Tournament. Giacoletti's best season was the 2003‚Äì2004 season, where the Eagles went 17‚Äì13 (11‚Äì3 in Big Sky play) and won the Big Sky Conference Championship. Giacoletti then guided the team to its first ever Big Sky tournament championship and the school's first ever NCAA Tournament appearance. Eastern Washington would lose to highly favored Oklahoma State in the first round. After successful stints with North Dakota State and Eastern Washington, Giacoletti was named the head coach of the University of Utah Utes. He replaced the legendary Rick Majerus, who retired in the middle of the 2003‚Äì2004 season. In his three seasons at Utah, Giacoletti led Utah to a 54‚Äì40 (.574) record. In Giacoletti's first season, the Utes went 29‚Äì6 (.829) and won the Mountain West Conference regular season championship. After beating UTEP in the first round, the 6th seeded Utes upset 3rd seeded Oklahoma in the 2nd round to advance to the NCAA Sweet 16. It was the school's first Sweet 16 since the 1998 season, when Utah finished as the NCAA runner-up to Kentucky. Ironically, it was Kentucky who would beat Utah once again, ending the 2nd winningest season in school history. During Giacoletti's tenure, Andrew Bogut was named the John R. Wooden Award winner and became the #1 draft pick in the 2005 NBA draft ‚Äì joining fellow University of Utah student-athlete Alex Smith as the only time that two athletes from the same school were selected #1 in their respective drafts in the same year. Giacoletti was named the 2005 Mountain West Coach of the Year, after guiding the Utes to a 13‚Äì1 conference record, the best record in conference history. Giacoletti's second season was dramatically different from his first. Gone was All-American Andrew Bogut, starting point guard Marc Jackson graduated, Justin Hawkins decided to transfer to New Mexico State and Richard Chaney transferred to Troy State, all major players in Utah's Sweet 16 run the season before. The Utes struggled with a young team and finished with the school's first losing record since the 1989 season, with a record of 14‚Äì15. Giacoletti's third season saw a further decline and the Utes had their worst season since 1983‚Äì84 (11‚Äì19). His approval rating among fans plummeted and many Ute fans sought his resignation. There were even a few anti-Giacoletti web sites that popped up including Giacolettimustgo.com. A day before Utah's final regular season game, versus conference rival BYU, he resigned as Head Basketball coach effective at the end of the season. At Drake, Giacoletti's teams got worse each season, just as at Utah (based on won-loss records). He resigned after 3+ seasons at Drake with a 32‚Äì69 record. On March 26, 2007, Giacoletti replaced former Gonzaga assistant coach Bill Grier as an assistant coach. Giacoletti's overall coaching record is 203‚Äì192 (.514) in 14 seasons. Giacoletti owns a 2‚Äì2 overall record in the NCAA Tournament and an 0‚Äì1 record in the National Invitation Tournament. Head coaching record *Resigned on December 6, 2016, with Jeff Rutter taking over for the rest of the 2016‚Äì17 season.

Life and career Oberg was born near Forestburg, Alberta in 1960. A physician by profession, Oberg was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a Progressive Conservative in 1993. He was first appointed to the Alberta Cabinet in 1997 and served numerous posts. Oberg was appointed Minister of Family and Social Services in March 1997. Over the next two years, he oversaw the move of children's services and services for persons with developmental disabilities to community-based delivery. He launched a western Canadian initiative to address Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and implemented an interprovincial strategy to share resources and develop new and better approaches for addressing FAS. As part of the Alberta Children's Agenda, he introduced the Alberta Child Health Benefit Program and played a key role in the development of the Protection of Children Involved in Prostitution Act. On May 26, 1999, Oberg was appointed Minister of Learning, a post he held until November 2004. During this appointment, he awarded a 14% increase to Alberta's teachers but only granted a 6% increase to the school boards. To cover this funding shortfall, Calgary school boards took funding from school maintenance leading to issues with school roofs collapsing During that time, he also served as a member of Treasury Board and as the Minister responsible for immigration. Oberg was an active member of the Canadian Ministers of Education and led the Canadian delegation to an International Group of Eight (G8) Education Ministers meeting. He oversaw the creation of Alberta's Commission on Learning and implemented many of its recommendations, including the reduction of provincial class sizes. He began the second language initiative in Alberta schools to give students an edge in the world marketplace and initiated the development of the daily physical activity program to improve the health of Alberta students. Following his re- election in the November 22, 2004 election, Oberg was appointed Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation. On March 22, 2006, shortly after announcing his resignation from his ministerial position following a directive from Premier Ralph Klein to all ministers running to replace him, Oberg was removed from the Progressive Conservative caucus after making comments at a Strathmore-Brooks Constituency Association annual general meeting urging the membership to vote their conscience in a crucial leadership vote at the March 2006 AGM of the party. He was re-admitted to caucus on July 25, 2006. On June 19, 2006, Oberg entered the race for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in Alberta. He failed to place in the top three in the November 25 first ballot (he placed fourth), and thus was not eligible for the second ballot to be held on December 2. Oberg's allegations of scandal on front runner Jim Dinning in the summer of 2006 appeared to have had a negative effect on his campaign. He later threw his support to third-place finisher and eventual winner Ed Stelmach. On December 15, 2006, Oberg was named Minister of Finance in Premier Ed Stelmach's cabinet. Oberg announced in December 2007 that he would not seek re-election in the next election in March 2008. On June 2, 2010, Oberg opened C2DNA in Edmonton, the first private DNA testing facility in Canada. He founded the lab with his brother and other investors. He stepped down as president and CEO the following day to avoid any conflict over a medical doctor being involved with such a high tech company, but said he would remain an advisor. On March 1, 2011, Oberg announced that he was joining the right-wing Wildrose Alliance Party. He said he would not be running for office but would participate in an advisory role to party leader Danielle Smith. He cited the conservative government's decision to abolish the multiple health districts in Alberta and replace them with an Edmonton-based super board, and the recently announced deficit budget, the fourth in as many years, as his reason for the switch.

It also possesses a minor anti-thrombin activity, mediated equally via AT and Heparin Co-factor II producing a ratio of anti-Xa:IIa activity >22. [Meuleman DG. Haemostasis 1992;22:58-65 and Ofosu FA Haemostasis 1992;22:66-72] Danaparoid is a low molecular weight heparinoid devoid of heparin. It consists of a mixture of heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. It is chemically distinct from heparin, has different protein-binding properties because of its low degree of sulphation and low surface charge density and thus has little cross-reactivity in heparin-intolerant patients. The TGI activity, considered by Fernandes et al. [Thromb Haemostas 1987;58/3:286-93 to provide an index of antithrombotic potential, of danaparoid has a half-life of 6.7 hours. Uses It is used to prevent deep venous clots, particularly in situations with a high risk of clot formation, such as after hip surgery. It is also used as a heparin substitute in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) which may otherwise cause paradoxical thrombosis. Danaparoid is used for thrombosis prophylaxis and treatment in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients. Although pre-treatment serological cross-reactivity with heparin- induced antibodies can occur in 5.2% of the patients it bears no systematic relationship with clinical cross-reactivity, 3.2% in the same study of 1478 patients with acute HIT [Magnani & Gallus Thromb Haemost 2006;95:967-81](ESRA). It is also approved for the treatment of DIC in Japan and although not approved for the following it has shown efficacy and safety in case reports of paediatric use [Bidlingmaier et al.

This set of verbs is grammatically notable because it inverts the sense of a following purposive clause, at least relative to the intuition of speakers of many non-Latin languages. Verbs of fearing can be used three different ways: fear of a person or thing, fear of performing an action and fear of an event occurring. * Fear of a person or thing is expressed using a verb of fearing (e.g. timeo) and a noun, either in the dative or the accusative. Mountford notes that there is no general rule on which case should be used, although different meanings can be conveyed depending on use. ** Hostes timet - 'he fears the enemy'. ** filio timet pater - 'the father fears for his son'. ** furem pomis timet agricola - 'the farmer fears the thief for his apples'. * Fear of performing an action is expressed using an infinitive, much like in English. ** timeo hoc facere . - 'I am afraid to do this'. * Fear of an event occurring is expressed using the conjunctions 'ne', conveying that, with regards to the event occurring, the negative is wished and the positive feared, and 'ut', conveying that the positive is wished and the negative feared. These conjunctions are then followed by the subjunctive, according to the sequence of tenses, with primary sequence tenses generally being followed by the present or perfect subjunctives and historic (or secondary) sequence tenses being followed by the imperfect or pluperfect subjunctives. ** vereor ne hostis veniat - 'I fear lest the enemy come', 'I fear that the enemy is coming'. ** vereor ne dum minuere velim laborem augeam, Cicero De Legibus I.4.12 - 'I fear that, while I wish to lessen the toil, I am increasing it'. ** timeo ne tibi nihil praeter lacrimas queam reddere, Cicero Pro Plancio 42.101 - 'I am afraid that I can give nothing in return save tears'.

The Z-spread is also widely used in the credit default swap (CDS) market as a measure of credit spread that is relatively insensitive to the particulars of specific corporate or government bonds. Since the Z-spread uses the entire yield curve to value the individual cash flows of a bond, it provides a more realistic valuation than an interpolated yield spread based on a single point of the curve, such as the bond's final maturity date or weighted-average life. However, the Z-spread does not incorporate variability in cash flows, so a fuller valuation of an interest-rate-dependent security often requires the more realistic (and more complicated) option-adjusted spread. Definition For mortgage-backed securities, a projected prepayment rate tends to be stated; for example, the PSA assumption for a particular MBS might equate a particular group of mortgages to an 8-year amortizing bond with 6% mortality per annum. This gives a single series of nominal cash flows, as if the MBS were a riskless bond. If these payments are discounted to net present value (NPV) with a riskless zero- coupon Treasury yield curve, the sum of their values will tend to overestimate the market price of the MBS. This difference arises because the MBS market price incorporates additional factors such as liquidity and credit risk and embedded option cost. The Z-spread of a bond is the number of basis points (bp, or 0.01%) that one needs to add to the Treasury yield curve (or technically to Treasury forward rates), so that the NPV of the bond cash flows (using the adjusted yield curve) equals the market price of the bond (including accrued interest). The spread is calculated iteratively. Benchmark for CDS basis The Z-spread is widely used as the \\"cash\\" benchmark for calculating the CDS basis. The CDS basis is commonly the CDS fee minus the Z-spread for a fixed-rate cash bond of the same issuer and maturity. For instance, if a corporation's 10-year CDS is trading at 200 bp and the Z-spread for the corporation's 10-year cash bond is 287 bp, then its 10-year CDS basis is ‚Äì87 bp.

It is a halophyte (a salt-tolerant plant) that typically grows in coastal regions and can be irrigated with salt water. The plant has great historical importance as a source of soda ash, which was extracted from the ashes of Salsola soda and other saltwort plants. Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). Chemical Revolution, (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65‚Äì90. . Soda ash is one of the alkali substances that are crucial in glassmaking and soapmaking. The famed clarity of 16th-century cristallo glass from Murano and Venice depended upon the purity of \\"Levantine soda ash\\", Turner, Guy (1999). \\"Allume Catina and the Aesthetics of Venetian Cristallo,\\" Journal of Design History 12, No. 2, pp. 111‚Äì122. and the nature of this ingredient was kept secret. Spain had an enormous 18th-century industry that produced soda ash from the saltworts (barrilla in Spanish). P√©rez, Joaqu√≠n Fern√°ndez (1998). \\"From the barrilla to the Solvay factory in Torrelavega: The Manufacture of Saltwort in Spain,\\" Antilia: The Spanish Journal of History of Natural Sciences and Technology, Vol. IV, Art. 1. . Archived at WebCite from this original URL on 1 March 2008. Soda ash is now known to be predominantly sodium carbonate. In 1807, Sir Humphry Davy isolated a metallic element from caustic soda; he named the new element \\"sodium\\" to indicate its relationship to \\"soda\\". Before soda was somewhat synonymous (in U.S. English) with soft drinks, the word referred to Salsola soda and other saltwort plants, and to \\"sodas\\" derived from soda ash. While the era of farming for soda ash is long past, S. soda is still cultivated as a vegetable that enjoys considerable popularity in Italy and with gourmets around the world. Its common names in Italian include barba di frate, agretti, and liscari sativa (short: lischi or lischeri). Of its culinary value, Frances Mayes has written that \\"Spinach is the closest taste, but while agretti has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy of spring.\\" Mayes, Frances (2000). Bella Tuscany: The Sweet Life of Italy, (Broadway), p. 15. .  Description  This annual, succulent plant can grow into small shrubs up to 0.7 m tall (sometimes called subshrubs). It has fleshy green leaves with either green or red stems. The tiny flowers develop from inflorescences that grow out of the base of the leaves near the stem. Jepson, Willis Linn (1993).

It is also reported to be naturalized in South America.  Soda ash and the biology of sodium accumulation  The ashes obtained by the burning of S. soda can be refined to make a product called soda ash, which is one of the alkali materials essential to making soda-lime glass, soap, and many other products. The principal active ingredient is sodium carbonate, with which the term \\"soda ash\\" is now nearly synonymous. The processed ashes of S. soda contain as much as 30% sodium carbonate. Barker, T. C., Dickinson, R., and Hardie, D. W. F. (1956). \\"The Origins of the Synthetic Alkali Industry in Britain,\\" Economica, New Series, Vol. 23, No. 90. (May 1956), pp. 158‚Äì171. A high concentration of sodium carbonate in the ashes of S. soda occurs if the plant is grown in highly saline soils (i.e. in soils with a high concentration of sodium chloride), so that the plant's tissues contain a fairly high concentration of sodium ions. S. soda can be irrigated with sea water, which contains about 40 g/l of dissolved sodium chloride and other salts. When these sodium-rich plants are burned, the carbon dioxide that is produced presumably reacts with this sodium to form sodium carbonate. right|thumbCells of the boatlily plant [http://plants.usda.gov/java/nameSearch?keywordquery=rhoeo+discolor&mode;=sciname&submit.x;=0&submit.y;=0 Rhoeo discolor]. The large pink region in each cell is a vacuole. Sodium is sequestered in vacuoles by halophyte cells. It is surprising to find a higher concentration of sodium than of potassium in plant tissues; the former element is usually toxic, and the latter element is essential, to the metabolic processes of plants. Thus, most plants, and especially most crop plants, are \\"glycophytes\\", and suffer damage when planted in saline soils. Glenn, Edward P., Brown, J. Jed, and Blumwald, Eduardo (1999). \\"Salt Tolerance and Crop Potential of Halophytes,\\" Critical Review in Plant Sciences, Vol. 18, No. 2, pp. 227‚Äì255. Xiong, Liming and Zhu, Jian-Kang (2002). (30 September 2002) \\"Salt Tolerance,\\" in Somerville, C. R. and Meyerowitz, E. M., eds, The Arabidopsis Book. American Society of Plant Biologists, Rockville, MD. . S. soda, and the other plants that were cultivated for soda ash, are \\"halophytes\\" that tolerate much more saline soils than do glycophytes, and that can thrive with much larger densities of sodium in their tissues than can glycophytes. The biochemical processes within the cells of halophytes are typically as sensitive to sodium as are the processes in glycophytes. Sodium ions from a plant's soil or irrigation water are toxic primarily because they interfere with biochemical processes within a plant's cells that require potassium, which is a chemically similar alkali metal element. Tester, Mark and Davenport, Romola (2003). \\"Na+ Tolerance and Na+ Transport in Higher Plants,\\" Annals of Botany 91: 503-527. . The cell of a halophyte such as S. soda has a molecular transport mechanism that sequesters sodium ions into a compartment within the plant cell called a \\"vacuole\\". The vacuole of a plant cell can occupy 80% of the cell's volume; most of a halophyte plant cell's sodium can be sequestered in the vacuole, leaving the rest of the cell with a tolerable ratio of sodium to potassium ions. In addition to S. soda, soda ash has also been produced from the ashes of S. kali (another saltwort plant), of glasswort plants, and of kelp, a type of seaweed. The sodium carbonate, which is water- soluble, is \\"lixiviated\\" from the ashes (extracted with water), and the resulting solution is boiled dry to obtain the finished soda ash product. A very similar process is used to obtain potash (mainly potassium carbonate) from the ashes of hardwood trees. Because halophytes must also have potassium ions in their tissues, even the best soda ash derived from them also contains some potash (potassium carbonate), as was known by the 19th century. Porcher, Francis Peyre (1863). Resources of the Southern Fields and Forests, Medical, Economical, and Agricultural. Being also a Medical Botany of the Confederate States; with Practical Information on the Useful Properties of the Trees, Plants, and Shrubs, (Evans and Cogswell, Charleston), p. 133. Online version at http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/porcher/porcher.html (retrieved 28 November 2006). Plants were a very important source of soda ash until the early 19th century. In the 18th century, Spain had an enormous industry producing barilla (one type of plant-derived soda ash) from saltwort plants. Similarly, Scotland had a large 18th-century industry producing soda ash from kelp; this industry was so lucrative that it led to overpopulation in the Western Isles of Scotland, and one estimate is that 100,000 people were occupied with \\"kelping\\" during the summer months. The commercialization of the Leblanc process for synthesizing sodium carbonate (from salt, limestone, and sulfuric acid) brought an end to the era of farming for soda ash in the first half of the 19th century. Freshly harvested agretti (S. soda) Agretti cooked with onions and bacon  Cultivation and culinary uses  The Italian name agretti is commonly used in English to refer to the edible leaves of S. soda; barba di frate (or friar's beard) is the most common of the Italian names. This plant is not a summer green and should be started early indoors or in autumn. The seed is notorious for poor germination at about 30 to 40% standard, much like rosemary. Though the plant is often grown in saltwater-irrigated land in the Mediterranean Basin, it will grow without salt water. S. soda is harvested in bunches when small, or cropped regularly to encourage new growth when mature. It is most commonly boiled and eaten as a leafy vegetable; the recommendation is to cook it in boiling water until the leaves soften, and to serve while some bite (crunch) remains (much like samphire). It can also be eaten raw; it is said to taste \\"grassy and slightly salty with a pleasant, crunchy texture\\". Salsola soda is sometimes confused with a plant known in Japan as okahijiki (land seaweed), which is actually the species S. komarovii. The harvested leaves of the two species have a similar appearance.  Phytoremediation  Salsola soda has also been studied as a bioremediation \\"biodesalinating companion plant\\" for crops such as tomatoes and peppers when they are grown in saline soils. The Salsola soda extracts enough sodium from the soil to improve the growth of the crop plant, and better crop yields result despite the competition of the two plants for the remaining minerals from the soil.

Players are leaders of different Egyptian dynasties who try to gain influence in 15 provinces of ancient Egypt. Influence and building pyramids earns points for the players. Points are scored at two instances during the game, at the end of the \\"Old Kingdom\\" and at the end of the \\"New Kingdom\\", and the player who amasses the most points wins the game. Gameplay Amun-Re is played in six rounds, where each round consists of an auction of provinces, followed by the purchase of \\"power cards\\" (for special use or that give bonuses in scoring), farmers (that generate income), and bricks (which are converted into pyramids on a three-for-one basis), a sacrifice phase, and then income. All prices in auctions, as well as for purchases, are based on the triangular numbers. The number of provinces available for auction in each round is equal to the number of players, but it is randomly determined which provinces will be available. Each province gives the player who wins it different abilities. For example, some provinces can support more farmers, some allow the players to buy more cards, and some produce a set income automatically. Certain power cards also give game-end bonuses if a player's provinces meet certain conditions, such as being on the same side of the Nile. Once the provinces have been auctioned, players may buy power cards and farmers as allowed by the provinces that they own, and as many bricks as they want or can afford. Following purchases, there is a sacrifice where each player either sacrifices a number of gold or can steal from the sacrifice (and a player must either sacrifice or steal, \\"sacrificing\\" 0 gold isn't allowed). Rewards are given to players based on their sacrifice (highest sacrifice receiving the most reward, \\"thieves\\" getting no reward beyond the three gold they steal). Players may choose whether they wish to receive cards, bricks, farmers, or some combination of these as rewards. Finally, players receive income. The sacrifice that has just taken place determines the income generated by each farmer. In certain provinces, income is only generated if the sacrifice is below a certain level. Other provinces provide a fixed amount of gold, or a combination of farmer income and fixed income. As the ends of rounds three and six (the end of the \\"Old Kingdom\\" and \\"New Kingdom\\") points are scored for pyramids, sets of pyramids, temples in territories controlled, and for bonuses earned using power cards. At the end of the Old Kingdom, players lose their claim to all of their provinces and all farmers are cleared from the board, while bricks and pyramids remain. The same provinces will be used in the New Kingdom, but they will be auctioned again and may be owned by different players. Although this game is best played with 5 players so the entire board is used, it does play quite well with 3 or 4. The game allows for many different strategies to be used.

Etching of Daniele Barbaro by Wenzel Hollar. Gentleman in ermine by Paolo Veronese, previously identified as Barbaro. Daniele Matteo Alvise Barbaro (also Barbarus) (8 February 1514 ‚Äì 13 April 1570) was an Italian architect, writer on architecture, and translator of, and commentator on, Vitruvius. He also had a significant ecclesiastical career. Barbaro's fame is chiefly due to his vast output in the arts, letters, and mathematics. A cultured humanist, he was a friend and admirer of Torquato Tasso, a patron of Andrea Palladio, and a student of Pietro Bembo. Francesco Sansovino considered Daniele to be one of the three best Venetian architects, along with Palladio and Francesco's father Jacopo. Biography He was born in Venice, the son of Francesco di Daniele Barbaro and Elena Pisani, daughter of the banker Alvise Pisani and Cecilia Giustinian. Barbaro studied philosophy, mathematics, and optics at the University of Padua. He has been credited with the design of the university's botanical garden. Barbaro served the Republic of Venice as ambassador to the court of Edward VI in London and as representative at the Council of Trent. In 1561 Pope Pius IV appointed him a cardinal in pectore, that is, secretly, to avoid causing diplomatic complications, but since Pius never made the appointment public Barbaro was never a cardinal. In 1550 he was elected Patriarch of Aquileia, an ecclesiastical appointment that required the approval of the Venetian Senate. On the death of his father, he inherited a country estate with his brother Marcantonio Barbaro. They commissioned Palladio to design their shared country home Villa Barbaro, which is now part of a World Heritage Site. Palladio and Barbaro visited Rome together and the architecture of the villa reflects their interest in the ancient buildings they saw there. The interior of the villa is decorated with frescoes by Paolo Veronese, who also painted oil portraits of Daniele; one reproduced in this article shows him dressed as a Venetian aristocrat, the other shows him in clerical dress. Barbaro died in Udine. His will refers to his collection of purchased and constructed astronomical instruments. Daniele renounced his inheritance in favor of his brother Marcantonio and was buried in an unmarked grave behind the Church of San Francesco della Vigna instead of the family chapel there. Daniele commissioned the church's altarpiece of The Baptism of Christ (c. 1555) by Battista Franco. Works Pratica della perspettiva, 1569 Barbaro may have designed the Palazzo Trevisan in Murano, alone or in collaboration with Palladio. Like at the Villa Barbaro, Paolo Veronese and Alessandro Vittoria probably also worked on the project, which was completed in 1557. His works include: *(1542) Exquisitae in Porphyrium Commentationes. *(1542) Predica de' sogni, published under the pseudonym of Reverend padre Hypneo da Schio. *(1544) Edited an edition of the commentaries on Aristotle's Rhetoric written. by his great-uncle Ermolao Barbaro. *(1545) Edited an edition of Ermolao Barbaro's Compendium scientiae naturalis. *(1556) An Italian translation with extended commentary of Vitruvius' Ten Books of Architecture, published as Dieci libri dell'architettura di M. Vitruvio. The work was dedicated to Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este, patron of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli. *(1567) He later simultaneously published a revised Italian edition and a Latin edition entitled M. Vitruvii de architectura. The original illustrations of Vitruvius' work have not survived, and Barbaro's illustrations were done specially by Andrea Palladio, and engraved by Johann Chrieger. As well as being important as a discussion of architecture, Barbaro's commentary was a contribution to the field of aesthetics in general. El Greco, for example, owned a copy. Earlier translations had been made, by Fra Giovanni Giocondo (1511) and Cesare Cesariano (1521), but this work was considered the most accurate version to date. Barbaro clearly explained some of the more technical sections and discussed the relationship between nature and architecture, though he also acknowledged the way Palladio's theoretical and archeological expertise contributed to the work. *(1567) Dell Eloquenza Dialogo *(1568) La pratica della perspettiva, a book on perspective for artists and architects. This work describes how to use a lens with a camera obscura. * an unpublished and unfinished treatise on the construction of sundials (De Horologiis describendis libellus, Venice, Biblioteca Marciana, Cod.

The latter work was supposed to have discussed other instruments as well, including the astrolabe, the planisphere of Spanish mathematician Juan de Rojas, the navigation instrument cross-staff, the torquetum, an astronomical instrument and Abel Foullon's holometer, a surveying instrument.

The Squadron is based at HMAS Albatross (NAS Nowra) and primarily operates from the Navy's Adelaide and Anzac class frigates. 816 Squadron provides the fleet with anti-submarine and anti-surface surveillance capabilities.

In 1948 816 Squadron was re- formed as a Royal Australian Navy FAA squadron operating Fairey Firefly aircraft. The Squadron formed part of the 20th Carrier Air Group embarked on HMAS Sydney. In 1952, 816 Squadron participated in the Montebello Islands atomic weapons tests and in 1953 saw service in the Korean War. Over the following 40 years, 816 squadron was disbanded and re-formed several times as newer aircraft were introduced. In 1956 with the arrival of HMAS Melbourne, 816 Squadron embarked as part of the 21st Carrier Air Group equipped with Gannet and Sea Venom aircraft. In 1967 the RAN acquired newer aircraft and Melbourne was extensively upgraded to handle the faster and heavier aircraft. 816 Squadron was re-equipped with Grumman S-2E Trackers. On 5 December 1976, a fire was deliberately lit by a Fleet Air Arm member near the aircraft hangars at HMAS Albatross. The fire destroyed or seriously damaged twelve of the thirteen S-2 Trackers in the RAN's possession. Subsequently, 15 second-hand S2-G Trackers were purchased from the US Government and all remaining serviceable or repairable S2-E Trackers were upgraded to the S-2G standard. 816 Squadron continued to operate S-2Gs until the decommissioning of HMAS Melbourne in 1982, when the Squadron was again disbanded. From 1984 until 1987, 816 Squadron operated Westland Wessex helicopters in the Army support role. 816 Squadron was re-formed in 1992 to operate Sikorsky Seahawk helicopters. The squadron has embarked helicopters on RAN Adelaide class and Anzac class frigates and has participated in operations including in the Persian Gulf. The squadron will continue to operate the Seahawk after the retirement of the S-70B-2 model. On 13 December 2012 it was announced that 816 Squadron will transition to the new MH-60R Seahawk, with 725 Squadron being reformed to be the training squadron.

The two streets run parallel east to west through the city centre, before Argyle Street terminates as a continuous route after passing under the M8 motorway and exists in sections through Anderston (traffic continues onto the Clydeside Expressway), then restarts at Finnieston as a re-named continuation of St. Vincent Street running north-west to Kelvingrove. By contrast, Sauchiehall Street is continuous and fairly straight, and passes over the motorway at Charing Cross. Name Sauchiehall is a corruption of the Scots sauchie hauch, sauchie; abounding in willows and hauch; a low-lying meadow by the side of a river (compare Sausalito, California). Hauch is pronounced 'haw' in Scots and can be mistaken for the Scots haw, pronounced the same, meaning hall. History Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow at the McLellan Galleries about 1920 Sauchiehall Street, c. 1910 At its height, from 1880 to the 1970s, Sauchiehall Street became one of the most famous streets in Glasgow, due to its panoply of entertainment venues and quality stores. The desire of wealthy merchants from 1800 onwards to own property on the outskirts of the city meant that Blythswood Hill and Garnethill started to be developed by William Harley of Bath Street fame, who also planned and developed Blythswood Square in the 1820s. As a consequence, the meandering country road from the Cathedral to Partick through the willows, and between these hills, acquired the name of the Saughie-haugh road. After it was straightened and widened in the 1840s it was named Sauchiehall Street and attracted more villas, tenement housing from 1860s, shops and eventually offices. A few of the original villas remained as of 1896, and lastly the 1960s, according to the Ordnance Survey map of Central Glasgow. Over time, the street has been home to a number of notable buildings, by distinguished architects. This includes the Glasgow Empire Theatre which was opened in 1897 at 31‚Äì35 Sauchiehall Street. The Theatre played host to big names such as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Dorothy Lamour, Jack Benny and Danny Kaye before it closed on 31 March 1963. The Royalty Theatre was also situated on Sauchiehall Street, opening in 1879 and showing operas, comedies and plays up until its lease ran out in 1913. Afterwards, during the First World War, it was purchased by the YMCA to become a hostel for soldiers and sailors. The building lived out the rest of its days after the war as the Lyric Theatre, before it was demolished in the late 1950s. By the 1900s the street contained noted picture houses, ballrooms, clubs, hotels, restaurants, art galleries and quality departmental stores, with numerous theatres in adjacent streets, including the Kings Theatre in Bath Street, Theatre Royal in Hope Street and the Pavilion Theatre, in Renfield Street, and Glasgow Art School in Renfew Street.The Second City by Charles Oakley published 1975 Glasgow by Irene Maver published in 2000 Glasgow's first \\"skyscraper\\", the Art Deco style Beresford Hotel, was built further along Sauchiehall Street in 1938 for the Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938. It later became offices for ICI and then a hall of residence for Strathclyde University before being converted into private apartments. Its \\"moderne\\" architecture was disliked when it was built and the original mustard-coloured stonework with red fins was rather unkindly described as \\"custard and rhubarb architecture\\". In 2014 Sauchiehall Street was the subject of the documentary TV series 'The Street'.  Regeneration  In January 2018, a ¬£7.2million investment from Glasgow City Council to transform and regenerate part of central Sauchiehall Street began, creating a multifunctional service verge, two-way cycle lane, two lane carriageway along with plantation of trees, shrubs and free wireless internet through the street. The initial design plan was completed in 2015 with the project being part of the Glasgow Avenues Project which is aimed to invest approximately ¬£115 million within the city between 2015-2021 and to create green and SMART infrastructure. The regenertation work was officially completed in 2019 September.https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/article/25020/Sauchiehall-Avenue-now- complete City centre section Sauchiehall Street looking westwards Sauchiehall Street formerly linked directly to Parliamentary Road at its eastern end, which continued through Townhead to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Today at the eastern end of Sauchiehall Street is the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and Buchanan Galleries, one of the largest city centre redevelopments in the UK. The section from West Nile Street to Rose Street was originally pedestrianised in 1972, with the easternmost part, linking to Buchanan Street, pedestrianised in 1978. This part of the street consists primarily of typical High Street retailers, although it also includes the Willow Tearooms, designed in 1903 by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, which has been restored to its original artistic designs and is open to the public as a tea room, restaurant and McIntosh venue centre. Nearby in Renfrew Street is the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Clubs and museums At the western end of the city centre section of the street, towards Charing Cross, there is an abundance of restaurants, bars and student-oriented clubs, such as the ABC, a former cinema and the largest nightclub in Glasgow, The Garage. This is a very popular street in terms of Glasgow nightlife. Notable landmarks in this area of the street include the former Beresford Hotel, Glasgow School of Art, the Glasgow Film Theatre, CCA Glasgow, the McLellan Galleries, the Royal Highland Fusiliers Museum and the Glasgow Dental Hospital and School.

Background Nadezhda Malaxiano was born into a Greek family in the city of Taganrog in 1862. She graduated from the Taganrog Mariinskaya Girls Gymnasium, and gave lessons in a church school. The family lived in a house on Gogolevski Street 8, next to Anton Chekhov's family house. Nadezhda Malaxiano became involved with a Narodnaya Volya group, being one of its activists in Taganrog's underground printshop in 1885‚Äì1886 on Glushko Street 60. She made a sham marriage with Akim Sigida (1868-1888) for conspiracy work at the printshop. Birthhouse of Nadezhda Sigida (Malaxiano) in Taganrog. ¬© TaganrogCity.Com The Don Process On 23 January 1886 following the disclosure of Narodnaya Volya's printers in Taganrog, she was arrested along with other organization members. The special hearing for her case was held in the Senate December 8‚Äì9, 1887 and was referred to as The Don Process (–î–æ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å). At court, Nadezhda Sigida used the tactics of Narodnaya Volya, refusing to testify and only acknowledging her membership to the revolutionary organization. She was sentenced to death penalty. Sigida appealed for pardon following the request of Malaxiano family, and the death penalty was replaced by 8 years of katorga on Kara River in Transbaikalia. The Kara katorga tragedy Sigida was a participant with fellow women convicts in demanding the removal of the prison commandant, Lt.Col. Masiuyukov, who was allowing harsh treatment of the women convicts, as evidenced in the incident with Yelizaveta Kovalskaya in Aug. 1888. Two hunger strikes followed without any changes. Nadezhda Sigida then slapped Masiuyukov's face on 31 Aug. 1889. This resulted in her transfer into the criminal section of the prison at Ust Kara. A third hunger strike followed on 1 Sept. 1889, resulting in Marie Kaluzhnaya, Nadezhda Smirnitskya, and Marie Kavelefskaya being transferred to Ust Kara. The governor-general Andrei Korf sentenced Madam Sigida to 100 birch-rods, but the order was not immediately carried out following a report from the prison surgeon that she could not withstand the punishment. The governor-general reiterated the order and it was carried out on 6 Nov. 1889. In protest, Nadezhda Sigida and 23 other political prisoners took poison. Six died. They included Nadezhda Sigida on 8 Nov., Marie Kaluzhnaya, Nadezhda Smirnitskya, and Marie Kavelefskaya on 10 Nov., plus Ivan Kaluzhni, and Sergei Bobokhof on 16 Nov. Aftermath This event stirred public response. Reports on the events of 1889 were published in major Russian and European newspapers, including two articles in the British newspaper The Times. As a consequence, Kara katorga was closed, and the corporal punishment for imprisoned women and dvorianins (nobility) was abolished by the law of March 28, 1893.

In 1940, the first class of thirteen students graduated. By that time, student enrollment had outgrown the original building. As the founders of the school deceased, their children decided it would be in the best interest of AEGS to grant ownership of the property and its operation to the Armenian Missionary Association of America. With a contribution from Mr. Stephen Philibosian and his assistance in finding new benefactors, funds were raised for the necessary reconstruction of the Kindergarten and elementary school buildings. Mr. Henry Guertmenian undertook the expense of constructing a new chapel. The school prospered till 1975, when the Civil War started in Lebanon. In 1978, the school building was severely damaged by shelling and it was occupied by the militia of the area.

It is the first lesbian autobiography published where the author does not employ a pseudonym.  Early life  Elsa Gidlow was born Elsie Alice Gidlow on 29 December 1898, at 9 Wells Terrace, Great Thornton Street, Hull, Yorkshire, England.Gidlow 1986, p. 1. Some sources give her first name as 'Elfie'; this seems to be a misreading of a 'long s' on the birth certificate. She is 'Elsie' in the 1901 Census, 1905 ship's passenger list, and on her first published poems. She seems to have been named after her German grandmother, Elisabeth Christiana, and her mother Alice. Her father, Samuel A.Gidlow, was a railway safety clerk from Nottingham, her mother, Alice May (n√©e Reichardt) Gidlow, the daughter of a German immigrant tailor. By 1901, the family had moved to a new house, 183 Clumber Street.1901 Census, England and Wales. In 1904, Samuel Gidlow emigrated to Canada. Alice, young Elsie and her brother Samuel joined him the following year. They settled in T√©treaultville, Montreal. Elsa had six siblings:Thea, Ivy, Stanley, Ruby, Eric, and Phyllis, whom she referred to as her her \\"unfortunate family,\\" because of their intimate association with mental illness. At the age of 15, Gidlow was first employed by her father on the Canadian Railway, and later by a contact of her father's in Montreal, a factory doctor, as assistant editor to Factory Facts, an in-house magazine.Elsa, I Come with My Songs: The Autobiography of Elsa Gidlow (San Francisco: Druid Heights Press, 1986, p.104-106) Career In 1917, she began seeking out fellow writers and meeting with them, particularly in the field of amateur journalism, which was popular at the time. With collaborator Roswell George Mills, Gidlow published Les Mouches fantastiques, the first magazine in North America where gay and lesbian issues were discussed, and the lifestyle celebrated. It was also adamantly anti-war, influenced by Mills and Gidlow's pacifist and anarchist viewpoints. H. P. Lovecraft, a fellow amateur journalist, attacked their work, leading Gidlow to defend it and attack back in return; the dispute created a minor controversy but brought Gidlow and Mills public, albeit negative attention.Faig, Ken. (July 2006). \\"Lavender Ajays of the Red-Scare Period: 1917‚Äì1920\\". The Fossil. 102 (4), 5‚Äì17. Gidlow moved to New York in 1920 at the age of 21. There, among other jobs, she was employed by Frank Harris of Pearson's, a magazine supportive of poets and unsympathetic to the war and England.Elsa, I Come with My Songs: The Autobiography of Elsa Gidlow (San Francisco: Druid Heights Press, 1986, p.82. She became the poetry editor later becoming the associate editor. It was at this time she met a young Kenneth Rexroth who became known as the \\"father\\" of the San Francisco Renaissance. In 1926, Elsa moved to San Francisco. Rexroth numbered her among his closest friends. With the exception of nearly a year spent in Europe, mostly in Paris, in 1928, she continued living in the San Francisco Bay Area for the rest of her life. In the 1940s, she lived in Fairfax, California, where in 1944 she became a home owner, active in local politics eventually becoming one of the planning commissioners. Due to her membership in political and writers' groups allegedly affiliated with communists, she was suspected of being \\"Un-American\\" and was subsequently investigated, subpoenaed and forced to testify in front of the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1947. HUAC's final report accused her of being affiliated with communist front organizations.California Legislature (1948). \\"Fairfax Investigation and Hearing. Fourth Report of the Senate Fact- Finding Committee on Un-American Activities, 1948: Communist Front Organizations. However, as a philosophical anarchist Gidlow was ideologically opposed to communism, and she denied the accusation.Sapphic Songs: Eighteen to Eighty (1982) Patricia Holt of the San Francisco Chronicle writes: > It amused Gidlow that such \\"radical\\" ideas set her up for a witch hunt in > Fairfax, where she had moved in her 40s. [Their] charges that Gidlow was a > \\"red,\\" as Stanton Delaplane reported in The Chronicle, were \\"Washed Pink at > Fairfax Hearings.\\" But Gidlow, who lived with a woman of African descent and > often made dinner for the Chans from San Francisco, was later accused of > \\"living with a colored woman and frequently entertaining Chinese > people...This was damning evidence that I could not be a loyal American.\\" Druid Heights Perhaps seeking solitude, Gidlow left her first home, Madrona, and the garden she had so lovingly tended for 10 years there, and in 1954, purchased a ranch which she subsequently shared with Roger Somers and his family above Muir Woods on the southwest flank of Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, California.Davis, Erik (May 2005). \\"Druids and Ferries \\". Arthur. 16. Gidlow named her portion of the mountain ranch, which included a secondary dwelling, \\"Druid Heights\\", a nod to her friend, Irish poet Ella Young.Killion, Tom; Snyder, Gary (2009). Tamalpais Walking: Poetry, History, and Prints. Heyday. . pp. 104‚Äì105. Gidlow and her partner Isabel Grenfell Quallo (1896-1985) lived together for a short time at Druid Heights, but family commitments called Isabel away. Also living there at one time or another were notable residents including her close friend Alan Watts, the poet Gary Snyder, furniture maker Edward Stiles and freewheeling bohemian Roger Somers. Along with Watts and his soon to be wife Mary Jane Yates, Gidlow planned and then co-founded the Society for Comparative Philosophy here in 1962. This society financed many of the improvements to the property and brought many of the important visitors and \\"artists in residence\\" for whom Druid Heights is now known.Besides Alan Watts, notable residents who, through Elsa's largess, found cheap rent and a place to create or escape were David Wills, Catherine Mackinnon, Roger Somers, Sunyata, John Blofeld, and many leaders of various women's rights efforts. pp.371-373 \\"Elsa, I Come with MY Songs\\" The Society morphed into the Druid Heights Artist Retreat after her death whereupon she provided the funds to begin the nascent-albeit short-lived-organization, Druid Heights Artists Retreat; A Facebook group called \\"Save Druid Heights\\" has been formed where many today hope to return DHAR to her home at Druid Heights. Gidlow socialized with many famous artists, radical thinkers, mystics, and political activists at Druid Heights, including, Dizzy Gillespie, Neil Young, Tom Robbins, Margo St. James, Allen Ginsberg, James Broughton, Baba Ram Dass, Lama Govinda, Robert Shapiro, Maude Oakes, Robert Duncan, Clarkson Crane, Sara Bard Fields, Kenneth Rexroth, Edward Stiles, Roger Somers, Catharine MacKinnon and Maya Angelou. Gidlow helped plan the funeral for her friend Alan Watts, when he died there. The monks from nearby Green Gulch Monastery often came to visit and participated in a ceremony there upon Alan's death which included an Anglican Mass; they then buried half Alan's ashes near his library at Druid Heights, and brought the second half to Green Gulch Monastery in the nearby valley. Autobiography Gidlow's autobiography Elsa, I Come with My Songs: The Autobiography of Elsa Gidlow, published in 1986, gives a personal and detailed account of seeking, finding and creating a life with other lesbians at a time when little was recorded on the topic; notably, it is the first lesbian autobiography written where the author does not use a pseudonym. It offers a superb account of one eyewitness-participant's view of twentieth- century artistic-bohemian life and of the cultural history of the San Francisco area. Gidlow also openly discussed her lifetime experience as a lesbian in the critically acclaimed 1977 documentary feature Word Is Out: Stories of Some of Our Lives, which was released theatrically and which was broadcast on many PBS stations around the United States starting in 1978.  Death  The last few months of her life, Gidlow experienced several strokes. She chose not to seek medical care in a hospital and died at home in Druid Heights at the age of 87.Associated Press (11 June 1986). \\"Poet Elsa Gidlow Dies at Age 88 [sic]\\". Merced Sun-Star. Gidlow was cremated and her ashes were mixed with rice and buried beneath an apple tree in Druid Heights. Parts of Druid Heights have subsequently fallen into ruin, but Gidlow's home remained intact as recently as 2012.  Legacy  Gidlow's estate donated her extensive personal papers to the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco in 1991. The collection consists of 16 boxes (13 linear feet) of correspondence, journals, literary manuscripts, legal records, photographs and other materials documenting Gidlow's life, work and relationships.

Allison's screen debut was as an ingenue in the 1915 star-making Theda Bara vehicle A Fool There Was. When Allison was cast that same year opposite actor Harold Lockwood in the Allan Dwan directed romantic film David Harum, audiences quickly became enamored of the onscreen duo. The pair starred in approximately twenty-five highly successful features together during the World War I era and became one of the first celebrated on-screen romantic duos. Allison and Lockwood's highly popular film romances ended, however, when in 1918 Lockwood died at the age of 31 after contracting Spanish influenza, a deadly epidemic that swept the world from 1918 through 1919 killing 50 to 100 million people globally. Allison's career then faltered markedly without her popular leading male co-star. She continued to act in films throughout the 1920s, although she never received the same amount of public acclaim as when she starred opposite Harold Lockwood. Her last film before retiring was 1927's The Telephone Girl, opposite Madge Bellamy and Warner Baxter. Allison was secretly married to Col. William Stephenson in Santa Ana, California, in December 1919, but the marriage was annulled in February 1920. On Thanksgiving day in 1920, Allison married writer and actor Robert Ellis. Allison filed for divorce from Ellis in December 1923, citing cruelty as the reason. Her filing explained the couple had married on November 25, 1920 in Greenwich, Connecticut and were separated about November 5, 1923. Allison then married Photoplay magazine editor James R. Quirk, a union that lasted until 1932. Allison's last marriage, to Carl Norton Osborne, lasted over 40 years until his death in 1982. In her later years, she spent much of her time at her vacation home in Tucker's Town, Bermuda, and was a patron of the Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland Orchestra]. Death Allison died of respiratory failure in Bratenahl, Ohio, in 1989 at the age of 98, and was buried at the Gates Mills South Cemetery in Gates Mills, Ohio.

It is located in Bhatiary, near Chittagong Hill Tracts, in the Chittagong District of south-east Bangladesh, about 13 kilometres north of Chittagong. The Academy is situated on the slopes of the Sitakunda hill ranges and the shore of the Bay of Bengal. Major General Anwarul Momen is the current commandant of the Academy. History Following the independence of Bangladesh with the break- up of Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Bangladesh Military Academy was established Chittagong Bhatiari in January 1974 for training of officers of the Army. The Military Academy was opened by the initiative of the then Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The Academy was initially raised at Comilla Cantonment on 29 November 1973 and later relocated at Bhatiary in 1976. This Academy was awarded National Standard in the year 1979. Bangladesh Military Academy provides training to the officers of the Bangladesh Army. From 1983 the officers of the Bangladesh Navy and Air Force must take three months training from the academy. The Academy chose a verse by national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, Chiro Unnata Momo Shir (translation: ever high is my head) as its motto. Regular long courses commenced from 1978. The first batch of officers of Bangladesh Army graduated from the academy in 1975. Honour code thumb|right|Officer Cadet (Khaki Ceremonial Dress) An officer cadet shall lead a life of honour and integrity. He or she shall not lie, cheat or steal. Training Adjutant in the passing out parade BMA provides military and academic training and character building. The Academy primarily trains men and women to be commissioned into the Bangladesh Army. In addition, the Academy conducts and orientation course for Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) officers, officer cadets and midshipmen of the Bangladesh Air Force and Navy respectively, and Pre-Commission Training for professor/teacher under-officers of Bangladesh National Cadet Corps (BNCC). Long Course cadets graduating from this Academy fall under Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP) curriculum. The academy has the intention of fostering and inculcating those attributes in an Officer Cadet (OC) which will ensure his continuous and progressive development as a regular officer in the Bangladesh Army, and developing future officers for the Bangladesh Army by training the Officer Cadets in a way that they can make decisions as and when required by the military profession.

The consistent flow of water displaces fine sediments which physically and chemically weathers rocks. Valleys that appear to have been created by groundwater sapping occur throughout the world in areas such as England, Colorado, Hawai‚Äôi, New Zealand, and many other places. However, it is difficult to characterize a landform as being formed exclusively by groundwater sapping due to phenomena such as pluvial runoff, plunge-pool undercutting, changes in water table level, and inconsistent groundwater flow. An example of drainage ways created purely by the outflow of subsurface fluids can be seen on the foreshores of beaches. As the surge of water and sand brought to land by a wave retreats seaward, the film of water becomes thinner until it forms rhomboid shaped patterns in the sand. Small fans form at the apex of the rhombic features, which are eventually fed by the remaining backflow of water traveling downslope. Channels begin to form headward in the form of millimeter wide rills along the sides of the fans; the creation of these small channel networks culminates when the last of the backwash dissipates. This is one of the processes involved in the formation of gullies, such as lavaka. Erosion by sapping tends to produce steep-sided U-shaped valleys of fairly uniform width with box-like, \\"theater-shaped\\" headwalls. This contrasts with the more common branching or dendritic pattern of V-shaped valleys produced by overland flows that become wider with distance from their source. Groundwater sapping has been suggested as the cause for erosion of the valley and channel networks on Mars, although studies show that groundwater alone can not excavate and transport the material required to create these canyons.Scientists believe that groundwater sapping created these gullies in Noachis Terra on Mars. NASA image. Geomorphology and geology Sapping typically occurs in permeable sandstones associated with high water tables underlain by an impermeable layer. Limited in its ability to travel vertically, water is forced to travel laterally where it eventually seeps out of the ground. Limestones, siltstones, and shales can be found in valleys created by groundwater sapping as well. Characteristic landforms Characteristic landforms caused by groundwater sapping are ‚Äútheater-shaped‚Äù channel heads and ‚ÄúU-shaped‚Äù valleys, which have a consistent width and steep valley walls. Weakened basal rocks are unable to support more resistant upper layers, causing valley head and sidewalls to collapse inwards. Theater-shaped channel heads are characterized by overhanging sidewalls that are relatively dry compared to the lower level rocks below the zone of seepage. The development of theater heads has been related to ‚Äúground-water flow direction, jointing and faulting, permeability contrasts, formation slope and dip angles, and formation cohesion‚Äù. The morphology of channels and valleys created by sapping are highly dependent on regional scale geology, and can be hard to distinguish from features created through alternative processes. Chemical precipitates can be used as indicators of groundwater water discharge implying that a valley or channel may have been formed as a result of sapping. These sorts of clues are important in areas where water is not currently being discharged. Notable landmarks Colorado Plateau Many ‚Äúnatural amphitheaters‚Äù can be found near the Colorado River. It is thought that sapping may have been more common in this area in the past when there was a higher water table. A shift in the climate and associated precipitation or the incision of the Colorado River are two factors that may have caused a change in the water table level. Mars Short, stream-like, deep channels have been observed on Mars. Very similar to valleys created by groundwater sapping here on Earth, the discovery of the Martian valleys has prompted numerous studies that aim to better understand the process of sapping. The two canyons at center-left in this photo from Canyonlands National Park in Utah have the theater-shaped heads typical of valley features shaped by groundwater sapping.

However, lavakas have also been found in South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and South Carolina, and similar landforms have been found in Brazil, the Great Plains of the U.S., and Swaziland. They are most common in tropical regions between the Cancer and Capricorn latitudes, especially the Central Highlands of Madagascar, where approximately one metre thick laterites develop on steep terrains in a monsoonal climate. Lavakas form where these hard laterites overlie thick (tens of metres) saprolite, on steep (35 to 55 degree) slopes, in areas that have a hot dry season and a warm wet season. Lavakas are not landslides. They are a type of gully, formed via groundwater sapping. They are usually shaped like a tear-drop with a steep, round headwall that narrows downhill into a shallow outlet channel. Although human activities‚Äîsuch as deforestation, overgrazing, road creation, and grassland burning‚Äîcan contribute to lavaka formation, lavakas can also develop by purely natural processes. Air photos reveal remnants of ancient lavakas in recently deforested areas, showing that those areas were eroded by lavakas before the rain forests grew; and C14 dating (radiocarbon dating) indicates that some lavakas are up to 20,000 years old, meaning they were present in the Malagasy landscape before the arrival of humans (human arrival in Madagascar is <2000 years before present). Among the natural controls on lavaka formation are the amount of seismic activity in the region, the topographic relief (or slope), and hydraulic conductivity of materials in the saprolite. For instance, earthquakes in the region can cause cracks in the hard, upper layer of laterite, which allows water to seep into the more porous layer of saprolite underneath. This causes chemical reactions within the saprolite to leech certain minerals from the rock and if the hydraulic conductivity of that rock is high enough, the water can carry those minerals away, which can cause the infrastructure of that rock to collapse and erode. Lavakas can often cause a lot of damage to nearby communities. During the monsoon season, heavy rains carry away all the eroded material from the lavaka, which can destroy surrounding crops and infrastructure. This is the basis for much of the recent research that has been conducted on the variables involved in lavaka formation (especially in Madagascar, where lavakas pepper the Central Highland landscape). The term \\"lavaka\\" entered the international geography / geology vocabulary following the work of Riquier (1954).

Biography Hill was the only son of Captain Robert Hill, an officer in the Cambridgeshire Regiment. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Merton College, Oxford, where he gained a football Blue in 1934. After two years travelling in Asia and the Middle East, he became a barrister, called to the Bar at Inner Temple in 1938. He was commissioned into 64th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery in 1939, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, and was attached for some time to the skiing unit of the 5th Battalion Scots Guards. From 1942 he served as an air observation pilot, flying spotter planes in Tunisia with No. 651 Squadron RAF. He was severely wounded, and invalided out of the Army in 1945 with the rank of Captain. After the war, he took up farming, buying a farm near Halesworth in Suffolk. He was a councillor on Wainford Rural District Council, Suffolk from 1946 to 1953, and a senior member of various East Anglian river and flood defence boards. He served as a governor of Charterhouse School from 1958 to 1990, and on the council of the University of East Anglia from 1975 to 1982. Hill was elected to the House of Commons on 13 January 1955, in a by-election caused by the expulsion of the sitting Conservative MP, Captain Peter Baker, after Baker's conviction for uttering, forgery and fraud and subsequent imprisonment for seven years. Hill scraped home with a majority reduced to only 865. He held then seat later that year at the 1955 general election, and was re-elected in four subsequent general elections (in 1959, 1964, 1966 and 1970).Times Guide to the House of Commons, London, The Times, 1970 His majority fell to only 119 in 1966. He did not stand in the February 1974 general election and was succeeded as MP by John MacGregor. In Parliament, Hill concentrated mainly on the agricultural interests of his largely rural constituency. Elected to the executive of the 1922 Committee in November 1956, in the aftermath of the Suez Crisis, he became an assistant government whip in January 1959 alongside Willie Whitelaw. While an MP, he pressed for the introduction of a small clock in the corner of the internal monitors, which would tell everyone within the Palace of Westminster how long a member has been speaking for. Hill served as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury from 1960 to 1964 and as Opposition spokesman on education and science briefly in 1965‚Äì66. He was later active on the education and agriculture select committees. He supported Edward Heath's policy of joining the European Economic Community, and was a delegate to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union. When the UK joined the EEC in 1973, Hill was appointed as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), and served from January 1973 until July 1974. At that time, MEPs were appointed by national parliaments, rather than being directly elected. In later life Hill concentrated on farming. He collected British art, particularly paintings by Samuel Palmer. He married Edith Luard (n√©e Maxwell) in 1944; she died in 1995. Hill was survived by their adopted daughter.

Early life Born in Long Beach, New York, Robinson is a graduate of Temple University in Philadelphia (1967). While still at school, he wrote for television and radio, including a weekly children's show, and was on the writing staff of The Mike Douglas Show, a nationally televised daily talk show. He continued working in the media during his four-year stint as an officer in the United States Air Force. Charged with running a press and public relations office for five generals at the height of the Vietnam War, he hosted a weekly talk show, scripted and directed several film projects, wrote short stories for national magazines and moonlighted as a disc jockey on local radio. His magazine credits include Playboy, McCalls, Barron's, Gourmet, Ambassador, True, Mademoiselle, Reader's Digest and TV Guide; his newspaper credits include The New York Times;The Washington Post, The San Francisco Examiner, The Christian Science Monitor and International Herald Tribune (for which he was a major contributor of features during the 1970s). In Britain his feature journalism has appeared in The Times, The Sunday Times, The Sunday Telegraph, Independent on Sunday and The Mail on Sunday, among others. He moved to the UK in 1982, with more than 600 published stories and articles to his credit, to concentrate on writing books. In 2007, he returned to New York and now divides his time between the US and the UK. Non-fiction Considered \\"one of world's leading experts on international financial crime\\" Robinson wrote his 1995 investigative tour de force, The Laundrymen, in which he uncovered the true extent of global money laundering. The book reveals how hundreds of billions of dirty dollars are derived mainly from the drug trade, then reinvested throughout the world by otherwise legitimate businessmen, lawyers, accountants and bankers. Business Week described it as \\"[a]n indictment of governments and banks\\". Robinson scripted and hosted several television documentaries, including one for the BBC, and another for Arte in France and Germany. Both have been shown in the United States. In 1998, he published a sequel to The Laundrymen, titled The Merger ‚Äì How Organized Crime is Taking Over The World. In it, Robinson described the disturbing lengths that transnational organized criminals go in order to build multi-national corporations; explained why organized crime is the major beneficiary of globalization; and claimed that transnational organized criminals have become the most powerful special interest group on the planet. Five years later he published another book in this series: The Sink, about crime, terrorism and dirty money. Between 1986‚Äì1994, he published three biographies: Yamani ‚Äì The Inside Story, about Saudi Arabia's former Minister of Oil Ahmed Zaki Yamani; Rainier & Grace, written about and with the cooperation of Monaco‚Äôs sovereign family and reissued in 2014 as Grace of Monaco after the fictionalized 2014 French biopic of Grace Kelly's life; and Bardot ‚Äì Two Lives, also written with the cooperation of Brigitte Bardot. His other non-fiction titles include: The Risk Takers (his first UK best seller) which highlighted the high-fliers of City finance, recounting their tales of money, ego and power; The Minus Millionaires, a sequel to The Risk Takers, in which he wrote about ‚Äòrisk takers‚Äô who had lost fortunes; The End of the American Century, for which Robinson gained access to secret archives in the former Soviet Union to reveal hidden agendas of the Cold War; The Hotel, stories gathered over five months as a fly on the wall in what is, arguably, the best hotel in the world; The Manipulators ‚Äì A Conspiracy to Make Us Buy, exposing the marketing world‚Äôs \\"hidden persuaders\\" 40 years after Vance Packard; and Prescription Games, an insider‚Äôs view of the global pharmaceutical industry, where science and marketing are deliberately kept apart and where, all too often, profit dictates who lives and who dies. In 2005, he wrote his first \\"as told to\\" with an old college friend, Joseph Petro: Petro's autobiography, Standing Next to History ‚Äì An Agent's Life Inside the Secret Service. In 2007, Robinson co- authored Ronnie Wood's autobiography, documenting Wood's years as a rock star and member of the most famous band in the world, The Rolling Stones. In 2009, he published his third \\"as told to\\": Leading From The Front, co-written with British entrepreneur, Gerald Ronson. His treatise on fraud, There's a Sucker Born Every Minute ‚Äì A Revelation Of Audacious Frauds, Scams, And Cons ‚Äì How To Spot Them, How To Stop Them was published in 2010. The Takedown, subtitled \\"A Suburban Mom, A Coal Miner's Son and the Unlikely Demise of Colombia's Brutal Norte Valle Cartel\\", was released in August 2011. Jeffrey Robinson's Criminal Intent ‚Äì Following The Money, the first in a series of eBooks on dirty money, crime, fraud and corruption was published in 2012. The second book in this series, Jeffrey Robinson's Criminal Intent ‚Äì The Swiss Wash Whiter was published in 2013. Fiction Jeffrey Robinson has written six novels: Pietrov and Other Games; The Ginger Jar; The Margin of the Bulls; The Monk‚Äôs Disciples; A True and Perfect Knight (under film option); and Trump Tower. Radio and television Robinson has appeared on NBC News, ABC News, CNN, Fox News, BBC Breakfast, BBC Newsnight, ITN, Channel 4 News, CBC, CNBC, Sky News, BBC World, NBC's The Today Show and Bloomberg Television. He has scripted and narrated various series for BBC Radio, including one on radio stars Amos and Andy, and one on American soap operas, \\"Tomorrow at the Same Time\\". He also wrote the BBC Scotland's Radio Three Drama of the Week, \\"Rossum‚Äôs Cyber Cafe\\", based on the Karel ƒåapek play \\"RUR\\". He conceived and wrote the pilot for the British crime drama series, Tightrope, for Yorkshire Television. He also wrote the pilot episode for a new British series on financial crime called Follow The Money. Other television scripts include Sister Banjo and Notice of Claim. He wrote and presented a training film for financial investigators for the Metropolitan Police in London England titled \\"The Common Factor\\".

She was a concubine of Murong Bao (Emperor Huimin) and the mother of Murong Sheng (Emperor Zhaowu). She gave birth to Murong Sheng while Murong Bao was serving as a low-level Former Qin official, in 373. What happened to her during the next three decades were not clear, but at the time when Murong Bao, then emperor of Later Yan, and Murong Sheng were fleeing from rebellions in 398, she was at the capital Longcheng (ÈæçÂüé, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning). At this time, she was carefully served by her daughter-in-law Princess Lan, despite the fact that Longcheng was under the control of Princess Lan's father Lan Han, who would set a trap for Murong Bao and have him killed later that year, and then claim the throne. Murong Sheng was spared, however, because he was Lan Han's son-in-law, and he soon overthrew Lan Han in a coup and reestablished Later Yan as its emperor. He did not initially honor her as empress dowager, as that honor belonged to Murong Bao's wife Empress Duan, but he did honor her with the title Empress Xianzhuang. After Empress Dowager Duan died in 400, he honored her as empress dowager. Because of how Princess Lan protected both her and Murong Sheng, when Murong Sheng considered executing her as the daughter of a traitor, Empress Dowager Ding greatly opposed it, and Princess Lan was spared, although she would never be empress. Sometime during Murong Sheng's reign, Empress Dowager Ding started an affair with Murong Bao's younger brother, Murong Xi the Duke of Hejian‚Äîwho was 12 years her son Murong Sheng's junior. After Murong Sheng was assassinated in a failed coup attempt in 401, she therefore forced the officials to bypass both Murong Sheng's son, Murong Ding (ÊÖïÂÆπÂÆö) the Crown Prince, and Murong Sheng's younger brother Murong Yuan (ÊÖïÂÆπÂÖÉ) the Duke of Pingyuan, whom most officials favored. Empress Dowager Ding's affair with Murong Xi continued. However, in 402, Murong Xi took two daughters of the official Fu Mo (ËãªË¨®) -- Fu Song'e and Fu Xunying as concubines, and favored them greatly‚Äîparticularly Fu Xunying. By comparison, his affair with Empress Dowager Ding cooled off, and she became angry. She plotted with her nephew Ding Xin (‰∏Å‰ø°) to depose Murong Xi and replace him with another younger brother of her son, Murong Yuan (ÊÖïÂÆπÊ∑µ, note different character than his brother) the Duke of Zhangwu. The plot was discovered, and Murong Xi executed Ding Xin and Murong Yuan and forced Empress Dowager Ding to commit suicide, but still buried her with honors due an empress.

It had kindergarten, and six primary classes. The last principal was Mrs. Vera Sevadjian. History The Armenian Evangelical Social Center School of Trad was built in 1936, in Trad district, which is a poor area in Eastern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon. It was originally a refugee camp for the Armenians escaping from Turkey because of the massacres in 1915. The school was built specifically for disadvantaged children ‚Äì the generation of the Armenian refugees who, because of their desperate situation, were left without education. Being aware of this situation, a missionary, serving in the Armenian community, Miss Elizabeth Webb, had the vision of founding a center to save these children. So she gathered them and taught them how to read and write. Later, Miss Webb bought a piece of land and donated it to the Armenian Evangelical Church to be used as a social center. Gradually, the center developed into a school. In 1948 the school had its full elementary classes. In 1969, the present building was established. The school shared its building with the social center, which was available for the children after school hours, where they could study & receive help. The social center also reached the children & the adolescents through spiritual & social activities. After the school close, due to the loss of students, it has transformed into an Armenian school for children with disabilities, Zvartnots.

Princess Lan was the daughter of Lan Han the Prince of Dunqiu and his wife Lady Yi. It is not known when she married Murong Sheng, but as of 398, she carried the title of princess, because Murong Sheng was the Prince of Changle under the reign of his father Murong Bao (Emperor Huimin). That year, after a rebellion secretly instigated by Lan Han, Murong Bao and Murong Sheng were forced to flee from the capital Longcheng (ÈæçÂüé, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning). During that flight, Princess Lan was described to have carefully served her mother-in-law, Murong Bao's concubine Consort Ding. Later that year, Lan Han laid a trap for Murong Bao and tricked him into believing that he was still faithful to Murong Bao, and then as Murong Bao approached Longcheng, he had Murong Bao killed. He then took over the throne. However, due to pleas from Princess Lan and Lady Yi, Lan Han did not execute Murong Sheng. Later that year, Murong Sheng overthrew Lan Han in a coup and restored Later Yan as its emperor. He considered executing Princess Lan, as the daughter of a traitor, but Consort Ding (then an empress dowager) interceded on her behalf, reasoning that Princess Lan was the one who protected both Murong Sheng and herself, and Princess Lan was spared. However, she would never be empress. Murong Sheng never created another person as empress during his reign, either, suggesting that he still considered Princess Lan as his wife.

UCI regulations specify that a scratch race should be held over 15 km for Elite Men and 10 km for Elite Women. Shorter distances of 10 km for men and 7.5 km for women may be used for qualifying rounds. Racers line up along the inner sprinter's rail and along the outer railing. The riders take a neutralised lap before the starting pistol is fired for the official start. A lapped rider must leave the race once they are overtaken by the peloton. There are no intermediate points or sprints. One tactic is for a rider, or more often a group of riders, to break away and attempt to gain a lap on the rest of the field. The peloton cannot be lapped; but that rider or those riders cannot be beaten by anyone in the peloton. The format favors endurance sprinters.  World championships  The scratch race has been a UCI World Championship event for men and women since 2002. Franco Marvulli of Switzerland and Alex Rasmussen of Denmark have both won the men's scratch event twice, while Wim Stroetinga of the Netherlands has the most medals with three between 2007 and 2012.

It was founded in 1922 in a refugee camp, on the initiative of the Reverend Yenovk Hadidian. Ten years later, it moved to its present location in Ashrafieh, eastern Beirut. The current principal is Mrs. Maral Deyirmenjian (2007- ). History After the Armenian genocide, the Armenians, who had sought refuge on the Eastern shores of the Mediterranean, tried to revive the Armenian life in a foreign land. One of the first envoys of this holy mission was Rev. Yenovk Hadidian, who formed an elementary school, in order to create a small Armenian family who would receive an evangelical education, and would give rise to new Armenian generations. On May 16, 1922, the first branch of the school started operating in a hut named ‚ÄúAdana Camp‚Äù in Beirut. In 1922, a second evangelical school was formed in the nearby ‚ÄúIsgenderon camp‚Äù. In 1924, the two schools united under the name ‚ÄúArmenian Evangelical School for boys and girls‚Äù. It received its official license in 1925. Through Reverend Henry H. Riggs' generous donation, and in memory of his wife and daughter, a new building was built to serve as a church and classroom in the Ashrafieh area. During the years 1943-50, in successive steps the school underwent further changes: * It became a full high school, with 11 years of study after 3 years of kindergarten. * It developed its own library within the possibilities of the times. * It furnished a modest laboratory with three departments - physics, chemistry and biology. * It developed a good high school choir with four voices. * It started the tradition of annual field days. * It started publishing Arpi ‚Äî the annual schoolbook. * Organized parent-teacher meetings and teacher training seminars The advancement of the Armenian Evangelical Central School continued as it set its first secondary class in the academic year 1944‚Äì1945. Ever since that day, the school is renamed Armenian Evangelical Central High School. In 1965, the school starts implementing the official state educational program with its three levels of examination: Certificate (6th grade), Brevet (9th grade), First and Second Baccalaureates (11th and 12th grades). In 1969, the kindergarten and elementary building was completed, and included a memorial hall dedicated to the victims of an accident during a school trip that took place on April 1, 1960, costing the life of 3 teachers and 18 students. During the academic year 1976‚Äì1977, grade twelve was established. The school celebrated its 60th anniversary in 1982 with commemorative events and its 65th in 1987 with a concert of performing arts. The publication of a large-format anniversary scrapbook/photo album marked the 70th anniversary. In 2002, church and community leaders, government ministers, academic representatives, school principals and others join the school family and its alumni in a public 80th anniversary grand jubilee.

Much of their contribution was funding or materials gathered by civilians, although a small number of Montserratians served in the Army, or Marine Navy. Montserrat holds a Remembrance Day annually on 14 November, to remember Montserratians who died in World War I, alongside those who died in World War II and the Iraq War. History A picture of the Montserrat Defence Reserve in 1915. After the German Empire invaded neutral Belgium as a part of the First World War, Great Britain declared war upon them on 4 August 1914. The entirety of the British Empire declared war upon them on the same day, including Montserrat, which was administered as part of the federal crown colony of the British Leeward Islands at the time. Almost immediately, a militia was formed, called the Montserrat Defence Reserve. Civilian effort One such group, the Montserrat Flag Day ladies, in 1917 Many Local Ladies Committees were formed to raise funds and support for the war effort. They also organized drives for material donations, such as one in which of Guava Jelly was collected. Many of the individual presidencies of the five Leeward Islands donated money for the war effort. Montserrat was one, donating ¬£1,000 (worth about ¬£40,000 today) to the British Empire. A number of locals served in the Merchant Navy. Of these, six died in service. Legacy Every 14 November, Montserrat holds a Remembrance Day, in which all Montserratians who died in the First World War are remembered, alongside with the Montserratians who died in the Second World War and the Iraq War. There was a war memorial in Plymouth, Montserrat, but it was abandoned when volcanic eruptions buried the town. In 2010 a new war memorial, in Little Bay, Montserrat, was christened. According to official records, the following Montserratians are recorded as having died due to the First World War: John Kingsley Martin, William Nugent Gordon, William Goather, Maurice Hannam, Burleigh Hannam, Adolphus Peters, and Arthur Samuel Warner.

It is a less preferred treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, increased urination, diarrhea, cough, and dizziness. Other side effects may include hearing loss and low blood potassium. Torasemide is a sulfonamide and loop diuretic. Use is not recommended in pregnancy or breastfeeding. It works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys. Torasemide was patented in 1974 and came into medical use in 1993. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 264th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical uses It is used to treat fluid overload due to heart failure and high blood pressure. Compared with furosemide, torasemide is associated with a lower risk of rehospitalization for heart failure and an improvement in New York Heart Association class of heart failure. In heart failure it may be safer and more effective than furosemide. Adverse effects No evidence of torasemide-induced ototoxicity has been demonstrated in humans. Loop diuretics, including torsemide, may decrease total body thiamine, particularly in people with poor thiamine intake, and this depletion may worsen heart failure. It is therefore reasonable to either also give thiamine supplements or to check blood thiamine levels in those being treated with chronic loop diuretics. Chemistry Compared with other loop diuretics, torasemide has a more prolonged diuretic effect than equipotent doses of furosemide and relatively decreased potassium loss. Names Torasemide is the recommended name of the drug (rINN) according to the (INN), which is the drug naming system coordinated by the World Health Organization. Torsemide is the official name of the drug according to the (USAN), which is the drug naming system coordinated by the USAN Council, which is co-sponsored by the American Medical Association (AMA), the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), and the American Pharmacists Association (APhA).

It has a dormitory for boys and girls. The present principal is Rev. Hagop Akbasharian. History Soon after the Armenian people of Musa Dagh were settled in the village of Anjar located in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon in 1939, the Armenian Evangelical School (elementary section) started to operate in the newly constructed church building. In 1947, at the peak of Second World War and while Anjarians refugees were suffering during these hard times, the school gave its first graduates from the elementary section. In 1947, Sister Hedwig Aienshanslin, member of the Swiss-German Hilfsbund Mission, arrived in Anjar and started the missionary work in a single room. In 1948, she was asked to assume the responsibility of running the school. Soon the elementary school became a junior high school. In 1955, the boarding department was established with 15 students from Kessab, Beirut and Zahleh. Two other sisters Mary Rock and Anna Nitsche joined sister Hedwig.

Early life Buzacott was born in Torrington, Devonshire, England, son of James Buzacott and his wife Ann, n√©e Hitchcock. He migrated with his elder brother William to Sydney in 1852. Journalism In Sydney, Charles joined the Empire newspaper and learnt to be a compositor. In 1860 he went to Maryborough, Queensland, and established the Maryborough Chronicle, selling it four years later. Buzacott then went to the Clermont goldfield, and started the Peak Downs Telegram, which he edited. In 1869 Buzacott sold his interest in the Telegram and moved to Gladstone where he took over the Observer. In 1870 Charles joined his brother William on the Rockhampton Bulletin, which the latter had established in 1861. In 1878 he moved to Brisbane, and became a leader writer on the Courier. During November 1880 he purchased Gresley Lukin's shares in the Brisbane Newspaper Company, the proprietor of the Brisbane Courier and its weekly The Queenslander and took on Lukin's former position as the company's managing editor and director. He was to remain in this position until 1894, occasionally taking and active role in the editing and occasionally contributing articles and editorials for the journals. He later bought the Rockhampton Argus and converted it into an evening paper, the Daily Record. He founded the Daily Mail in Brisbane in 1904, and in spite of his advancing years carried it through its early difficulties as editor and managing director. Politics In 1873 Charles Buzacott was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Rockhampton. In 1874, and again in 1876, he brought in bills in an attempt to establish an eight-hour work day in Queensland, but he was in advance of his times and did not succeed in steering them past the committee stage. He resigned from the assembly in 1877. Having been returned to the assembly again, in January 1879 he became postmaster-general in McIlwraith's first ministry, and was responsible for the drafting of the divisional boards measure which was the foundation of later Queensland local government acts. He was an active minister, and during his two years of office he united the previously separate post and telegraph departments, and succeeded in having tenders called for a Torres Straits service between Brisbane and London. The telephone was also introduced during his period. He was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council in 1894; although a lifetime appointment, he resigned in May 1901 and did not hold political office again. Later life With his health failing, he retired to Stanthorpe in 1906 but continued to make occasional contributions to the press until not long before his death at Banca View in Stanthorpe on 19 July 1918. Buzacott had married Louisa Whiteford in 1857 who survived him with three sons and two daughters. Street name A number of street names in the Brisbane suburb of Carina Heights are identical to the surnames of former Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. One of these is Buzacott Street.

G. Wodehouse, which first appeared in the United States in the 6 October 1928 issue of Liberty and in the United Kingdom in the November 1928 The Strand. Part of the Blandings Castle canon, it features the absent-minded peer Lord Emsworth, and was included in the collection Blandings Castle and Elsewhere (1935), although the story takes place sometime between the events of Leave it to Psmith (1923) and Summer Lightning (1929).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 68‚Äì69, A53. Wodehouse intended to write a sequel, set 8 years after the events of this story. Plot summary Despite glorious weather, Lord Emsworth is miserable; it is August Bank Holiday, which at Blandings means the annual Blandings Parva School Treat. The precious grounds are to be overrun with fairground rides, tea-tents and other amusements for the throngs (their numbers padded this year by a number of children visiting from London for the fresh air), and Emsworth is forced by his sister Connie to wear a stiff collar and a top hat, despite the warm weather and his strong protests. On top of that, Glaswegian Head Gardener Angus McAllister is making noises on his pet hobby, the project to gravel the famous Yew Alley. Emsworth, fond of its mossy carpet, loathes the idea, but his sister is in favour, and stronger personalities overpower the elderly Earl all too easily. Visiting Blandings Parva, to judge the flower displays in the gardens, Emsworth is frightened by a large dog, but he is rescued by a small girl named Gladys, one of the Fresh Air London children. They chat and become friends, especially when she reveals that, having been spotted picking flowers in the Castle grounds, she hit McAllister in the shin with a stone to stop him chasing her. At the f√™te, Emsworth is uncomfortable as ever in his dress clothes, and dreading the speech he will have to make. In the tea-tent, his top hat is knocked off by a cleverly aimed rock cake, and Emsworth flees, taking refuge in an old shed. In there he finds Gladys, miserable; she has been put there by Connie, for stealing from the tea tent, but it emerges she was only stealing her own tea, going without to provide for her brother Ern, barred from the f√™te for biting Connie on the leg. Delighted by this family, Emsworth takes Gladys into the house, and has Beach provide a hearty tea. Beach provides a feast to take back to Ern, and Gladys requests some flowers too. Emsworth hesitates, but cannot refuse her; as she is picking her flowers, McAllister rushes up in a fury, but his master, encouraged by Gladys' hand in his, stands up to the man, putting him in his place. Connie approaches, demanding Emsworth return to make his speech; he refuses, saying he's going to put on some comfortable clothes and go and visit Ern.

Accessed via Google cache July 10, 2007. is an American lawyer and former Democratic Party politician who is the only surviving brother of former New York Senator, First Lady, and Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the brother-in-law of former U.S. President Bill Clinton. In 1989 Rodham became Assistant Public Defender for the Miami Drug Court. Rodham made one run for political office, winning the 1994 Democratic nomination for the United States Senate seat from Florida, but losing the general election to incumbent Senator Connie Mack III. During the Clinton administration, some of his actions came under public scrutiny. Since then he has been in private practice as a lawyer. Early life Rodham was raised in a United Methodist family in suburban Park Ridge, Illinois. His father, Hugh Ellsworth Rodham (1911‚Äì1993), was of Welsh and English descent. He managed a successful small business in the textile industry. His mother, Dorothy Emma Howell (1919‚Äì2011), was a homemaker of English, Scottish, French Canadian, and Welsh descent. Hugh has an older sister, Hillary, and younger brother, Tony. He was often referred to as \\"Hughie\\" growing up, to distinguish him from his father, and that name form would persist into adulthood at times. Attending Maine South High School in Park Ridge, Rodham was known as what one writer later termed a \\"fun-loving jock\\" and was not as academically oriented as his sister had been. He graduated from Maine South High School in 1968, playing on the football, wrestling, and baseball teams. Like his father, Rodham attended Pennsylvania State University, graduating in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Health and Human Development. While attending Penn State he was backup quarterback on the Penn State Nittany Lions football team. Rodham was also an active member of the Sigma Triton charge of Theta Delta Chi fraternity at Penn State. He served in the Peace Corps in Colombia for over a year, training teachers; he later called it the most rewarding experience of his life.\\"Looking Back on Interviews With the Rodhams and Roger Clinton\\" , Larry King Live, February 24, 2001. Accessed July 11, 2007. He then gained advanced degrees in education (M.A.) and law (J.D.) at the University of Arkansas, the latter occurring while Bill Clinton was governor of the state.  Public defender  Rodham moved to Miami, where he began to practice criminal law; from around 1980 he became an investigator for the public defender in Dade County.Barry Meier, \\" First Brother-in-Law Has Tobacco Talks Role\\" , The New York Times, April 23, 1997. Accessed July 10, 2007. For a while there he shared a condominium with his brother Tony. While frequently paired together in commentary, the brothers have distinct personalities; Hugh has been compared by friends and acquaintances to the Norm Peterson character from the television series Cheers. Rodham married Maria Victoria Arias, a Cuban immigrant lawyer whom he met while she was interning at the public defender's office, in 1986. She had come to the United States from Cuba around 1960, as Fidel Castro took power, when she was two years old. She graduated from the University of Miami Law School in 1989 and subsequently became an established real estate lawyer. She switched from being a Republican to a Democrat during the Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992, and founded a group known as Cuban-American Women for Clinton. A 1993 Washington Post story described her as \\"a smart, tough attorney, a Cuban version of Hillary.\\" She has given both Bill and Hillary Clinton advice on Cuba matters and an immediate connection to the Cuban exile community in Miami. The couple have lived in Coral Gables, Florida, during their married life. In 1989 the groundbreaking, much imitated Miami Drug Court was co-founded by State Attorney Janet Reno, Chief Judge Gerald Wetherington, and Public Defender Bennett Brummer. Seeking to combat the crack cocaine epidemic of the time, it sought to find nonviolent drug users and give addicts structured programs to overcome addiction, often in lieu of a jail sentence. Rodham became Assistant Public Defender in the court.\\"Hillary Clinton Addresses Presidential Pardons; Are Clinton Controversies Stifling Bush Agenda?\\" , CNN, February 22, 2001. Accessed July 11, 2007. In this work Rodham was praised by local officials for effective, tireless work for long hours at low wages; Rodham himself would later say, \\"Public Defenders are the last bastion for liberty ... we provide a strong defense for every citizen accused.\\" Reno would later credit Rodham for making the Drug Court a success: \\"That drug court could never have been established without the cooperation of the public defender ... [who] was a fellow by the name of Hugh Rodham, the assistant public defender. And we didn't know who Hugh Rodham was in those days, but one thing he did was get his clients in the back room, and every now and then you could hear him raise his voice and tell them to get with it and let's go. ... He was assiduous in protecting his clients' rights, but he was also extraordinarily helpful in making sure his clients understood that here was a real chance to solve their problems.\\"\\"Town Hall Forum with the Attorney General\\" , U.S. Department of Justice, March 9, 1998.

In 1993, Hugh Rodham and his brother Tony ignited a small controversy when they tried to solicit corporate donations for Clinton's inaugural parties; they dropped the effort after a public outcry.Priscilla Painton, \\"Guess Who's Paying for Dinner\\" , Time, January 25, 1993.

Once the Clintons entered the White House, Rodham became a sometime golfing buddy of the President and he and Maria often joined family get-togethers at Camp David.Hillary Rodham Clinton, Living History, Simon & Schuster, 2003, , plate B-15. When Clinton was having trouble with his cabinet nominations, Rodham recommended Reno to the president for appointment as U.S. Attorney General.Viveca Novak and Jay Branegan, \\"Are Hillary's brothers driving off course?\\" , CNN, November 1, 1999. Accessed July 10, 2007. Run for U.S. Senate Rodham left the public defenders office to run for the United States Senate in Florida in 1994. He had some basic problems as a candidate, including having to explain why he had never registered to vote in the state until 1992. In addition, his campaign manager left the campaign after not getting paid for weeks when told there was no money but discovered that funds were in the account he actually set up. Rodham did not always demonstrate a deep understanding of the political issues of the day and had difficulty being taken seriously by political commentators. In the contest for the Democratic Party nomination, Rodham competed in a four-person primary field and finished first with 34 percent, which meant there would be a runoff election. After the first primary, the third-place finisher, flamboyant Miami lawyer and perennial losing candidate Ellis Rubin, joined forces with Rodham as a \\"senior executive consultant\\" and hatchet man. The second-place finisher and other entrant in the runoff was Mike Wiley, a talk radio personality and advocate of UFO conspiracy theories. In the presence of Rodham at a press conference, Rubin leveled the accusation that Wiley was hiding his Jewish faith by changing his name from his birth name, Michael Schreiber, and that Wiley \\"changed his name before the campaign to deceive voters about his Jewish religion.\\" Rodham won the runoff contest by a margin of 58 to 42 percent, but as a result of the friction that had developed, Wiley refused to endorse Rodham afterward. In the general election contest against incumbent Republican Senator Connie Mack III, Rodham had few funds, only one television commercial, and little support from the Florida Democratic party establishment in a year that saw Republican gains everywhere. Bill and Hillary Clinton both campaigned for Rodham, but his organization was unable to take advantage of their help.Michael Wines, \\"Clinton Finds Few Listeners at Rally in Miami\\" , The New York Times, October 16, 1994. Accessed July 10, 2007. In one case late in the race, Bill Clinton flew to Miami to speak at a rally for Rodham but only 200 people were in the audience due to poor advance work by the campaign. In November 1994, Rodham lost by a 70 percent to 30 percent margin to Mack. Rodham lost in even normally Democratic areas such as Broward County. After the election, Rubin switched allegiance again and charged Rodham with election law violations in the first primary. The Federal Elections Commission eventually dismissed the allegations. Rodham then had some involvement in Broward County politics, supporting a candidate for the County Commission who lost. He subsequently tried to unseat the Dade County Democratic Party Chairman; after badly losing that race, he disappeared from the Florida political scene. Return to law After losing the Senate race, Rodham returned to law, while also trying his hand at hosting a syndicated talk radio show around 1996. The radio show failed to find an audience. During 1995 through 1997 Rodham started working on a very large tobacco lawsuit with other attorneys; observers were puzzled as to Rodham's involvement, given his limited experience in the area, and speculated that influence peddling might be the reason. The massive case eventually failed to gain Congressional approval, but by one report a 2002 settlement involved in it made Rodham financially secure. In 1999, Hugh and brother Tony Rodham entered into a $118 million venture to grow and export hazelnuts from the Republic of Georgia. The U.S. State Department and National Security Advisor Sandy Berger became upset, however, when the Rodhams' local business connection in Batumi turned out to be Aslan Abashidze, a major political opponent of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, then a key U.S. ally in the region.\\"Best Local Boy Gone Bad (2001)\\" , Miami New Times. Accessed July 10, 2007. After initial resistance, Berger and the Clintons prevailed upon the Rodham brothers to drop the deal. Hugh Rodham stated that he was only acting as a lawyer for the venture and did not have money invested in it. Episodes such as these led Hillary Clinton's White House staff to refer to Hugh and Tony as \\"the Brothers Rodham\\",Todd S. Purdum, \\"Siblings Who Often Emerge In an Unflattering Spotlight\\" , The New York Times, February 23, 2001. Accessed July 28, 2007. extending the American tradition of troublesome presidential siblings to the brother-in-law category; one senior White House official would be quoted as saying, \\"You never wanted to hear their name come up in any context other than playing golf.\\" As the Clinton administration came to a close in early 2001, it was discovered that Hugh Rodham received around $400,000 for legal services regarding gaining the Presidential pardon of businessman Glenn Braswell who had been convicted of fraud, and the sentence commutation of drug trafficker Carlos Vignali. While legal experts said that Rodham may well not have done anything wrong, the appearance of possible impropriety certainly existed. Moreover, coming while the Bill Clinton pardons controversy was already in full force, this was a further embarrassment for the former administration and even got the attention of the Congressional House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Hillary Clinton, now a newly-sworn-in Senator, said, \\"He's my brother. I love my brother ... I'm just extremely disappointed in this terrible misjudgment that he made ... I knew nothing about my brother's involvement in these pardons. I knew nothing about his taking money for his involvement.\\" Both Clintons pressured Rodham to return the $400,000, which he promptly did. During this time, Rodham additionally collected media criticism for being overweight and a poor dresser. By 2001 he was working in the law firm of Rodham & Fine in downtown Fort Lauderdale. Subsequently, Rodham stayed out of the public eye. When his sister's 2008 presidential campaign came to the family summer home of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for the state primary, he hosted a reception for campaign workers. By the mid-2010s, he was still working at Rodham & Fine. During the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016, he and Tony appeared with her at a rally in Scranton in April 2016. But generally he kept a low profile during the campaign and declined to speak to the press.

It was a belligerent in the Ituri conflict. At its height, the group had approximately 2,000 to 3,000 fighters. The FAPC was formed in March 2003. The group was supported by the Ugandan government of Yoweri Museveni which was trying to support its own interests in Eastern Congo following its formal military withdrawal from the region in 2002. Originally, the Ugandan government had supported the Union of Congolese Patriots (Union des Patriotes Congolais, UPC) rebel group but relations broke after the UPC sought aid from the Rwandan regime. The FAPC was founded and led by J√©r√¥me Kakwavu, a former member of a number of rebel groups including the UPC, with the backing of Ugandan general Salim Saleh. The militia was operational around Aru, Ariwara and Mahagi along the section of the Congolese-Ugandan border to the north of Lake Albert. The region is known to have rich gold and timber resources. Unlike most rebel groups active in Eastern Congo, the FAPC did not raid or intimidate civilian populations and instead attempted to create a state-like administration to raise money. It did not aim to overthrow the Congolese government but instead to maintain control of the border region it occupied. The group prioritised trading and cross-border smuggling in conflict minerals, especially gold, into Uganda which was worth an estimated 1‚Äì2 million United States dollars each month in 2004. Under pressure from the United Nations MONUC peacekeeping mission, the FAPC was forced to disband. The process began on 6 March 2005 and a number of its members, including Kakwavu, were integrated into the Congolese military. A few FAPC rebels fled into exile.

The society has also clashed with Salafists, specifically after the group organised a candlelight vigil for the victims of the Al Dana boat tragedy and Asalah MP Adel Mouwda criticised the laying of a wreath as against religious values. The society's Faisal Fulad responded \\"We did not do anything that was against religion especially that Islam is a religion of tolerance and compassion.

The screenplay concerns a paranormal television that causes zombies from a never-ending film to enter the real world. The film was released direct-to-video and has been re-released several times since then. Plot An unsolicited television is delivered to a writer's house. The writer discovers that the only program the television is capable of picking up is a seemingly endless, plotless, black and white zombie film titled Zombie Blood Nightmare.A short review at the House of Horrors.Com Despite unplugging the television, it reactivates and spawns the film's zombies, who attack and kill the writer. The next day, the delivery men arrive to claim the set, realizing it was meant to go to the Institute for Paranormal Research; they find only the body of the writer, bound in his front hallway and dressed in party clothes. Three months later, teenagers Zoe and Jeff arrive at the house ahead of their parents, who are moving back to the United States after years abroad. Jeff befriends dog walker April and she accompanies him home, where the dog she is watching escapes into the woods. The dog comes upon the zombies that escaped the television set and have since been living in the woods. The zombies kill the dog, meanwhile Jeff and April are searching for it and later find the remains. The zombies follow the pair back to the neighborhood. That afternoon, a man named Joshua Daniels comes looking for the television set, claiming he bought it at a yard sale and mailed it to the Paranormal Institute after it killed his wife. Jeff turns him away but later that night discovers the television set, which has mysteriously migrated to the attic. A bizarre woman briefly appears on the set, beckoning to Jeff, before a man appears and kills her, revealing her to be a zombie. The man, who calls himself \\"The Garbage Man\\", says the only way to prevent more zombies from appearing is to tape a mirror to it. The next day, the zombies kill April's father, his maid, and their next-door neighbors before laying siege to Zoe and Jeff's house. Jeff, Zoe, and April barricade themselves along with Joshua, who has returned to reclaim the television set. Joshua explains the psychology of the zombies: realizing that they are in a liminal state between life and death, the zombies kill humans out of envy. They are repulsed by mirrors because it reminds them of their own hideousness, and attack when they sense fear. The zombies can be tricked into believing they are dead by wounding and then dismembering them, but they must be left unburied. They can also be destroyed by trapping them in an enclosed space, which causes them to enter a psychotic state and cannibalize one another. Despite the fortifications, a zombie breaks in and incapacitates April. Zoe and Jeff lock the zombie out of the house after it leaves with April's body. The next morning, Joshua and Jeff head into the woods to hunt down the zombies. Joshua sets traps and takes up a sniper position while using Jeff as bait. Using a bow and arrows, they shoot and incapacitate all the zombies but one, whom they pursue. Joshua is killed, and Jeff gets trapped in a shed, where he discovers April's dead body. The lone remaining zombie wakes the others from their delusions of death and kills Jeff as he decapitates it. The remaining zombies return to the house, where Zoe is alone. Remembering the zombies only attack when they sense fear, Zoe invites the zombies in, and they become docile. Zoe discovers a mirror on the basement door, tricks the zombies into entering the basement, and they go berserk. After they consume each other, their remains are sucked back into the television, and Zombie Blood Nightmare finally ends. Sometime later, Zoe's parents come to visit her in the hospital, where she is being treated for post traumatic stress disorder. They unwittingly bring her the possessed television set from the house, hoping a familiar item will aid her recovery. After everyone leaves, the television plays Zombie Blood Nightmare again. Zoe looks at the screen in horror as one of the zombies within the TV looks directly at her and starts growling. The screen then goes black before we hear Zoe scream. Cast Release The Video Dead was released direct-to-video. Embassy Home Entertainment released it on VHS in November 1987. The film debuted for the first time in widescreen format on MGM HD on November 1, 2009. Scream Factory (a division of Shout! Factory), released the film in a special edition DVD and Blu-ray combo-pack in a double feature with the 1986 film TerrorVision on February 19, 2013. Reception David Maine of PopMatters wrote that it \\"contains a few suspenseful scenes and some over-the-top moments, and might be of interest to zombie fans or zombie completists\\". Adam Tyner of DVD Talk called it \\"essential viewing for fanatics of off-kilter '80s horror\\". Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict wrote, \\"The only thing The Video Dead has going for it are above average make-up effects for a film of this ilk.\\" Bruce Kooken of HorrorNews.Net praised the non-traditional nature of the zombies and wrote, \\"All the zombie lovers in the world need to see The Video Dead. It is a great 80s zombie incarnation filled with little gems of humor that all fans of the genre can find entertaining.\\" Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle said, \\"This unsung zombie adventure is a nice surprise, offering gripping action as well as thoughtful meditations on zombies.\\" Bloody Disgusting included the film in their list of Top Ten Most Awesome Chainsaw Scenes.

He personifies the Age of Enlightenment in the Russian Orthodox Church. He was born at Chashnikovo near Moscow as Platon Levshin () in the family of a psalmodist, and was educated at the seminary and the Slavic Greek Latin Academy of Moscow. In 1757 he was appointed instructor in Greek and rhetoric at the latter institution, and became distinguished as a pulpit orator. Within the year he was called to be instructor in rhetoric at the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra near Moscow. Here he became a monk, adopting the name of Platon, and in 1761 was made rector of the seminary of the monastery. A sermon preached by him in October 1762, produced so favorable an impression on the Empress Catherine II that she summoned him to court to be the religious instructor of the eight-year-old heir apparent, Paul Petrovitch. Here he came into close contact with Voltaire and the encyclopedists, but without injury either to his faith or his character. Platon remained at the Russian court, winning the admiration of even Voltaire, until the marriage of the heir apparent to Maria Feodorovna, daughter of Duke Eugene of W√ºrttemberg, in 1773. During this time he published, for the use of his royal pupil, his Orthodox Doctrine: or, A short Compend of Christian Theology (Moscow, 1765), in which the influence of Western thought, and even of rationalism, may be distinctly traced. At the same time, Roman Catholic doctrines are mercilessly attacked, while the Lutheran tenet of ubiquity and the Reformed theory of predestination also receive their share of criticism. This catechism was followed, a year later, by the Exhortation of the Orthodox Eastern Catholic Church of Christ to her former Children, now on the Road to Schism, pleading, though with scant success, for lenient treatment of dissenters from the Orthodox Church. In 1768 Platon became a member of the Holy Synod, and in 1770 was made bishop of Tver, though he still remained at St. Petersburg, finally being the religious instructor of the new grand duchess. In 1775 he was enthroned archbishop of Moscow, and throughout the reigns of Catherine II, Paul, and Alexander I diligently promoted the religious, moral, intellectual, and material welfare of his archdiocese, maintaining meanwhile an unceasing literary activity. In 1775 he issued a catechism for the use of the clergy, and in 1776 a short catechism for children, as well as one in the form of a dialogue, while his brief history of the Russian Church (1777) is the first systematic treatise of its kind in the Russian language. In 1787 Platon reluctantly consented to become metropolitan of Moscow. He visited the city but seldom, however, passing the winter in the Troitsky monastery and the summer in the Pererva Monastery close to Moscow. Here he supervised personally the studies of the seminarians, who included three destined to succeed him as archbishop of Moscow. Compared to his predecessors, Platon was rather lenient towards the Old Believers and allowed them to establish their first chapels in Moscow, notably the Preobrazhenskoe cemetery. He also formalized the arrangement, known as Edinoverie, earlier introduced by Archbishop Nikephoros of Slaviansk, that allowed Old Believer communities to join the established church, while maintaining their traditional form of worship.Vladimir Karpets, What is Edinoverie? It was Platon who crowned both Paul (1797) and Alexander I (1801); but despite his close and cordial relations with the court he preserved to the last his firmness and his independence. Shortly before his death he aided in preparing the way for the foundation of the Russian Bible Society which was established in the year in which he died. Shortly before his death, Platon was evacuated from Moscow, which was about to be surrendered to Napoleon. The collected works of Platon were published at Moscow in twenty volumes in 1779‚Äì1807, the greater portion of these writings being sermons, of which there are about 500. An abridged English translation of Platon's catechism was prepared from a Greek version of the Russian original (London, 1867), and his sermon preached at the request of the empress to celebrate the victory of Chesma also appeared in English (London, 1770).

It is the second Digimon manga and was serialized in Shueisha's V Jump magazine from 2006 to 2008. The main character is Tsurugi Tatsuno and is partnered with a Greymon (later Agumon). Tsurugi makes contact with the Digital World through his Digimon Mini virtual pet device and a \\"Battle Terminal\\", a virtual reality interface. Digimon can use the technology to materialize in the human world as well. Plot Tsurugi Tatsuno is a boy who competes in Virtual Digimon Battle tournaments. When a Kuwagamon appeared in the Real World, his Greymon came to life and protected him. Tsurugi is summoned to the Digital World by Piximon to save the Digital World from the evil Barbamon. Since his Digimon has a hexagon shape on him, it's an Illegal Digimon, meaning that Digimon bearing such symbols can help save the Digital World. Tsurugi's Greymon later De-Digivolves to Agumon and they meet other characters destined to save the Digital World from the forces of Barbamon. Now they must stop Barbamon and his minions before they get all the DigiMemories and take over both worlds. Characters Main characters * Tsurugi Tatsuno and Agumon : Tsurugi Tatsuno was originally partnered with a Greymon. However, in a battle against Peckmon, Piximon De-Digivolved Greymon to Agumon. Agumon later gains the ability to Digivolve into GeoGreymon. Later, when Tsurugi and GeoGreymon were fighting Shou and Yatagaramon, GeoGreymon gained the ability to digivolve into RiseGreymon. Now, in the System World, after Tsuguri receives the Digivice Twin R, RiseGreymon has digivolved into VictoryGreymon. After defeating NEO, he is turned to stone and reborn as a Digi-Egg. * Yuu Inui and Gaomon : Gaomon is the Digimon partner of Yuu Inui. Tsurugi Tatsuno and Agumon first encounter them when Gaomon steals from them. After the defeat of a Tankdramon, they joined Tsurugi in his adventures to stop Barbamon. Gaogamon later was able to Digivolve to his ultimate form, MachGaogamon. Now, in the System World, after Yuu receives the Digivice Twin L, MachGaogamon has Digivolved into Z'dGarurumon. After defeating NEO, he is turned to stone and reborn as a Digi-Egg. * Ami Kitajima and Pichimon : Pichimon is the Digimon partner of Ami Kitajima, a friend of Tsurugi who hates battling. Their purpose in the storyline is unknown at this time. In Chapter 11 however, it is revealed that Pichimon carries the DigiMemory of Water and can Digivolve to MarineAngemon. Pichimon and Ami are kidnapped and Pichimon alongside his DigiMemory is taken. With the help of Ami and her DigiSoul, Pichimon breaks free from NEO's body and Digivolves to MarineAngemon to help fight NEO. She has a crush on Tsurugi, and when she returned to the real world, she was last seen in Tsurugi's lap. * Shou Kahara and Peckmon : A black Peckmon is the Digimon Partner of Shou and possesses the Bird Digi-Memory, which Barbamon needs to gain total control over the Digital World. Peckmon first appeared when Shou attacked Tsurugi Tatsuno under the guise of the Hacker Tamer \\"the Black Winged Knight\\". Peckmon fought Tsurugi's Greymon, causing it to de-digivolve into Agumon, and would have claimed total victory if not for Piximon's intervention. In its battle against MegaKabuterimon to claim the Plant/Insect DigiMemory, Shou Digivolved Peckmon into Yatagaramon. During the attack on Light City, Chaosdramon revealed to Shou that Barbamon told him to dispose Shou and that is why Chaosdramon tried to kill him. Afterwards, he reappears to fight Murmuxmon, making Peckmon digivolve into Ravemon. When Shou and friends met Norn in the real world (about age eight or so) he fell in love with her. He started to hate Tsurugi because he forgot about her immediately and became obsessed with soccer. After battling some bullies who had stolen several little kids' Digimon minis, they grabbed his and broke it. The hate of the bullies, and want of seeing Norn again coursed through him, causing Barbamon to take interest. Barbamon saved Peckmon, and took Shou out of the real world. Shou and Barbamon share the same ideas about Digimon happiness, causing Shou to become his minion right away. In the end, Shou had to say good-bye to Norn and returned to the real world. * Barbamon : Barbamon seems to be the main enemy in this manga. Barbamon was able to hijack the host computer of the Digital World, which lied in the System World. His target is to take over the Digital World, and for this goal, he has gathered a large army of Digimon and even a human named Shou (together with his partner Peckmon) to help him. To take over and reform the Digital World as he wishes, he needs the eight \\"DigiMemories\\", which Shou is helping him gather. It is later revealed that he was merged with Yggdrasil. In the end, he is defeated by Tsuguri and VictoryGreymon, but not before completing NEO. * Commandments : Barbamon has many Digimon working for him. These include a Sealsdramon, a Waspmon, an army of Commandramon, a Mummymon, the Commandment Strategist Datamon, some Armored Trailmon, and an army of BladeKuwagamon. He also has the 3 Commandment Commanders (Chaosdramon, Murmuxmon, and Zanbamon) who lead his Commandments. The 3 Commandment Commanders were defeated, but turned out to survive when it came to the final battle against NEO. * Datamon : A Datamon works as a Commandment Strategist for Barbamon. Datamon is shown when he spies on a secret meeting between Shou and Norn. He created the Hot Spring Paradise and piloted an Angewomon robot. When trying to claim the DigiMemory of Water from Pitimon in the Angewomon robot, Pitimon Digivolves to MarineAngemon and Datamon retreats. He also reveals to Tsurugi that he's competing against Shou to get the DigiMemories for Barbamon. He later returns to help in the final battle against NEO. * Piximon : Piximon is the general overseer in the Digital World. He is the one who opposes Barbamon and thus calls a human to the Digital World to fight him. However, he is badly hurt by an attack from Sealsdramon, having the Holy DigiMemory taken away from him. It seems that he recovered in recent chapters and reappears during the final battle against NEO with a NurseGuardromon. * Andromon : Another overseer of the Digital World who resides in Light City. He is killed by Chaosdramon, but his projection revealed to Tsurugi and Yuu that he placed a virus in his DigiMemory that makes the machine part of NEO not obey him. * Norn Mikihara : A girl imprisoned by Barbamon. She was sent by Yggdrasil to learn what Digimon mean to Humans, where she befriends Tsuguri, Yuu, Ami, and Shou. She approached them and asked what were Digimon to them. When she heard that they were all friends and family, she told them to always fight for Digimon. Shou fell in love with her, and then hated Tsrugi because he forgot of the promise. She is actually the manifestation of Yggdrasil's very conscience. * Yggdrasil : A resident of the System World and the God of the Digital World. After he sent Norn to the real world, he was forcibly merged with Barbamon. * NEO : An artificial Digimon being created by Barbamon. To complete this creation, all 8 DigiMemories are needed. He first appears as a small black blob, but evolves to an embryonic form by merging with the Holy DigiMemory and the Insect DigiMemory (which gives him thorns on his shoulders and mask). It grows a left arm after receiving the Machine DigiMemory and begins to grow a body and fiery hair after receiving the Water DigiMemory (alongside Pichimon who serves as his head). After Barbamon is defeated, it absorbs the Bird DigiMemory (which gives NEO wings) and Darkness DigiMemory (which forms his body) along with a massive amount of data to take on an almost-completed humanoid form. Following his awakening, NEO defeats VictoryGreymon and Z'dGarurumon. NEO then steals the Dragon DigiMemory (which gives NEO a right arm) and the Beast DigiMemory (which gives NEO beast legs) to complete himself. He plans to eradicate both the Real and Digital Worlds, and replace them with worlds of his own creation. Soon, NEO starts to lose control of the DigiMemories. After a battle against VictoryGreymon and Z'dGarurumon, NEO regresses back into the 8 DigiMemories now learning the bond between humans and Digimon.

Leaving school at 14, Norman worked in the film industry from the age of 16, working his way up from sweeper of the cutting-room floors at Ealing Studios to become an editor at 19. Editor Norman's early credits as editor were for British International. They included The Man from Chicago (1930), Compromising Daphne (1930), Fascination (1931) for director Miles Mander, Potiphar's Wife (1931) with Laurence Olivier for director Maurice Elvey, and Men Like These (1932) which he also co wrote. Norman went on to edit Carmen (1932), Why Saps Leave Home (1932), Lucky Girl (1932), The Maid of the Mountains (1932), and the comedy Timbuctoo (1933). He did Red Wagon (1933) for director Paul L. Stein, Facing the Music (1933), and Over the Garden Wall (1934), then another with Stein, April Blossoms (1934) with Richard Tauber. Norman edited I Spy (1934) for director Allan Dwan, then The Old Curiosity Shop (1934). He did several with Stein: Mimi (1935) for with Gertrude Lawrence, Heart's Desire (1935) with Tauber and Stein, and Viennese Love Song (1936) aka Faithful. There was also Regal Cavalcade (1935), The Perfect Crime (1937), Who Killed John Savage? (1937) with Elvey, and Glamour Girl (1938). Norman edited an early movie for TV, The Case of the Frightened Lady (1938). Then he returned to features: They Drive by Night (1938), Everything Happens to Me (1938) for director Roy William Neill, and The Nursemaid Who Disappeared (1938) for Arthur Woods. In 1939, prior to joining the British Army, Norman co-directed with Anthony Hankey the thriller Too Dangerous to Live starring Sebastian Shaw and Anna Konstam. He returned to editing with Hoots Mon (1940) for Roy William Neil, and The Frightened Lady (1940). Norman's last editing credits before entering the services were The Prime Minister (1941) for Thorold Dickinson and This Was Paris (1942). Second World War In 1942 Norman was enlisted in the British Army rising to the rank of Major. In August 1945 he was deployed to Burma as part of a secret mission to trial sonic warfare in the fight against the Japanese. This involved Norman and his platoon broadcasting the sound of troop movements in the Burmese jungle as a decoy to allow strategic Allied troop activity to take place in what would otherwise have been heavily fortified or armoured Japanese positions. Ealing Return to editing After the war Norman returned to editor on The Overlanders (1946) for Ealing. According to Norman director Harry Watt was not satisfied with the editing job done by Inman Hunter \\"so they asked me to take it over. I actually ripped it all apart and started over again. But I thought this could ruin Ted Hunter's career so I suggested they credit him as editor and I would take the title of supervising editor.\\"Brian McFarlane, An Autobiography of British Cinema, Metheun 1997 p439 Ealing kept him on to edit The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (1947) and Frieda (1947) for Basil Dearden. Producer Director Harry Watt had been impressed by the work Norman did on The Overlanders, so he took Norman with him to Australia to help with Eureka Stockade (1949). Norman was producer and editor. Ealing promoted Norman to producer, on which he worked A Run for Your Money (1949) which he also co wrote. Norman went back to Australia to produce Bitter Springs (1950), written and directed by Ralph Smart. Like Eureka Stockade it was a box office disappointment. Norman then went with director Henry Watt to Kenya where they made Where No Vultures Fly (1951); Norman was credited as producer and writer. It was a huge success. So too were the next two films Norman produced, both starring Jack Hawkins: Mandy (1952) and The Cruel Sea (1953). Norman and Watt reunited with West of Zanzibar (1954) a sequel to Where No Vultures Fly, which was less popular. Director Norman returned to directing with the thriller The Night My Number Came Up (1955), made for Ealing. He moved over to Hammer Film for who he made the sci-fi/horror movie X the Unknown (1956), replacing Joseph Losey at the last minute. In 1952 Norman said he wanted to make A Town Like Alice, Robbery Under Arms' and Come in Spinner in Australia. The first two movies were made without him but Norman went to Australia for Ealing again to make The Shiralee (1957) starring Peter Finch The movie was a success. Norman had another hit with the war movie Dunkirk (1958) starring John Mills and Richard Attenborough. It was one of the last movies made by Ealing, which soon wound up production. Norma made another trip to Australia, to produce and direct an adaptation of the play Summer of the Seventeenth Doll (1959), for Hecht Hill Lancaster. The movie was not a success, critically or commercially. Norman directed an adaptation of The Long and the Short and the Tall (1961) for Michael Balcon's new company; it was commercially successful in England. Less well received were Spare the Rod (1961) with Max Bygraves and Mix Me a Person (1962) with Adam Faith. Television career In the 1960s, he worked as director on several notable British TV series including Gideon's Way (7 episodes), The Baron (3 episodes), The Champions, The Saint (21 episodes), The Avengers (2 episodes), My Partner the Ghost, Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (3 episodes), Department S (3 episodes), Shirley's World, The Persuaders! (6 episodes), The Pathfinders and Return of the Saint. He started directing Hammer's The Lost Continent (1969) but was replaced during the shoot by Michael Carreras. Retirement and death Norman was forced into retirement after a laryngectomy for cancer in 1978. He died in Knebworth, Hertfordshire on 18 February 1993 at the age of 81 after suffering a seizure whilst driving near his home. Family Norman's son, Barry, was a prominent UK film critic and broadcaster, whilst his daughter, Valerie, is a script editor and director.

It is based on the adventures of L√≥ng Zh√¨guƒÅng, FƒÅng Shƒìngji√†n, Lu√≤ Huƒ´, and a young girl named ƒÄmƒõi. It introduces the concept of X-antibody Digimon, but their origin is different from that in the Japanese Digimon Chronicle.  Synopsis  Ten thousand years ago, a great and powerful Digimon was defeated and sealed away by the Royal Knights as the \\"Digi Core\\". Years later, a virus infected the digital world, leaving only those that possessed the X-Antibody remaining. The only members of the Royal Knights remaining are Omega of Power (Omnimon X), Duke of Courage (MedievalGallantmon/Gallantmon X), and Magna of Miracles (Magnamon X). At the start of the series, the \\"God of Death\\" MetalPhantomon draws L√≥ng, ƒÄmƒõi, FƒÅng, and Lu√≤ into the digital world. Originally, L√≥ng is left alone with his Digimon (which starts out as a Dorumon), and has to battle his friends Lu√≤ and FƒÅng, who are under MetalPhantomon's control. At one point, MetalPhantomon steals the \\"Dragon Spirit\\" of L√≥ng's partner, who is now a Dorumon. While MetalPhantomon uses it to revive the Digi-Core, L√≥ng, Lu√≤ , and FƒÅng learn from Omega of Power that they can get a new Dragon Spirit from Duke of Courage - with this, they can save Dorumon's life. But when they arrive in Duke's area of the Digital World, they are given a series of tests by Duke's servant, MameTyramon. After completing the tests and battling Duke himself, they manage to earn Dorumon a new Dragon Spirit. However, now they must battle MetalPhantomon, who has resurrected the Digi-Core as Dexmon. In the end, L√≥ng and the others manage to save their friend ƒÄmƒõi, who was sealed inside Dexmon, and return to the real world.  Characters   Humans and Digimon Partners  Zh√¨guƒÅng L√≥ng :The main character and characteristic \\"goggle boy\\". Though somewhat irresponsible and foolhardy, he manages to come through for his friends, as well as save his Digimon when his Dragon Spirit is lost. Dorumon :Dorumon is Zh√¨guƒÅng's Digimon partner, and gets very angry when his partner does not live up to his responsibility for him. In the end, he is revealed to actually be Alphamon, the leader of the Royal Knights from long ago. :* Dorumon is initially only shown becoming a Dorugoramon, and later, a DexDoruGreymon and then DexDorugoramon through Death-X Evolution. After losing his Dragon Spirit, he becomes Grademon, then Alphamon and lastly Alphamon (Ouryuuken) in the final battle. FƒÅng Shƒìngji√†n :Zh√¨guƒÅng and Lu√≤'s friend. Temporarily controlled by MetalPhantomon. FƒÅng believes that wisdom is just as good as raw power, and is a good strategist. Ryudamon :FƒÅng's partner. He is very respectful, and calls FƒÅng his master. :* FƒÅng's partner is originally a Gaiomon, but is defeated by Zh√¨guƒÅng's DexDorugoramon. It reverts into a Digi-Egg, and temporarily becomes a DexDorugamon through Death-X Evolution. Finally, it is revived as a Ryudamon. Ryudamon eventually becomes a HisyaRumon, and after receiving power from the Royal Knights, gains the ability to become Ouryumon. Then, finally, Ouryumon becomes the blade that allows Alphamon Ouryuken to destroy Dexmon. Lu√≤ Huƒ´ :Lu√≤ is the young friend of Zh√¨guƒÅng and FƒÅng. Short and timid, but manages to rise to the occasion in several instances. He was briefly controlled by MetalPhantomon. Agumon X :Agumon X is Lu√≤'s Digimon partner, and is sometimes played up for comic relief. :* When Lu√≤ is controlled by MetalPhantomon, Agumon X first appears as a MetalGreymon X. Later, Lu√≤ manages to help it become a Greymon X and after receiving power from the Royal Knights, Agumon gains the ability to become an Omekamon. ƒÄmƒõi :Zh√¨guƒÅng, FƒÅng, and Lu√≤'s friend. She was sealed within Dexmon until she was rescued by Zh√¨guƒÅng and Grademon.  Royal Knights  After the sealing away of the Digi-Core 10,000 years ago, and the coming of the Virus, there are only three of these Digimon left. At the end of the series, Dorumon is revealed to be their leader, Alphamon. Omnimon X :Omnimon X is referred to here as \\"Omega of Power\\", first appearing in Chapter 3 :\\"FƒÅng's Trap\\". One of only three remaining Royal Knights of thirteen originally. FƒÅng was under the control of a MetalPhantomon in Chapter 2 and Zh√¨guƒÅng receives a message from FƒÅng on his Digital Monster D-Cyber Version 1.0 to head North and find him at MetalPhantomon's lair. A battle ensues and Lu√≤ tells Zh√¨guƒÅng not to argue with FƒÅng and that he wants to remain in the Digital World, believing FƒÅng that MetalPhantomon will give them power. Zh√¨guƒÅng strikes Lu√≤ and tells him to wake up. In doing so, Lu√≤ is rendered unconscious. FƒÅng believes Lu√≤ murdered and orders his Digimon to come out, a Gaiomon (Samudramon in the Digital Monster D-Cyber Special Limited Edition and GaiOumon in the Digimon Chronicle). Zh√¨guƒÅng's Digimon Death-X Evolves to a DexDoruGreymon in his grief and guilt. In trying to recover Lu√≤, Zh√¨guƒÅng realizes FƒÅng's trap and that the Lu√≤ before him is not the real one, an illusion. FƒÅng switched the real one to anger Zh√¨guƒÅng. FƒÅng says he will send him to the \\"God of Death\\" (MetalPhantomon), his Gaiomon is however defeated by Zh√¨guƒÅng's DexDorugoramon, who in his anger, caused the evolution but his Digimon is on a rampage. Afterwards, Zh√¨guƒÅng recovers the real Lu√≤ but is interrupted in seeing Omnimon X before them, asking \\"Who dares to break the peace of the Digital World?\\" He smelled the scent of DexDorugoramon's Digi-Core and goes on to say he defeated the same evil Digi-Core ten thousand years ago and orders the children to leave. Omnimon X engages DexDorugoramon in battle and FƒÅng is freed of MetalPhantomon's control. Omnimon X discovers DexDorugoramon to be stronger than he was ten thousand years ago and inflicts insufficient damage with his Garuru Cannon even at a close distance. As Omnimon X invokes his Grey Sword, Zh√¨guƒÅng's body produces a huge energy sphere and Omnimon X realizes it is Zh√¨guƒÅng transferring power to DexDorugoramon making him seem invincible, although unknowingly. Omnimon X attempts to then kill Zh√¨guƒÅng but FƒÅng says they can still control DexDorugoramon and tells Zh√¨guƒÅng to take the power back. Zh√¨guƒÅng then strikes DexDorugoramon and calms him but MetalPhantomon arrives and steals his Dragon Spirit to revive the Digi-Core of a Dexmon. Omnimon X attempts to prevent it but MetalPhantomon escapes. Omnimon X says Zh√¨guƒÅng's Dorumon's body will disappear in ten days and even he can not save him. He tells them to head through the Valley of the Morning Dragon and to the Jade Waterfall to obtain a new one from a Royal Knight called \\"Duke\\", a MedievalGallantmon. He then attempts to track MetalPhantomon. While he is able to follow him to where Dexmon is sealed away as the Digicore, he is unable to prevent Dexmon's revival nor defeat him in battle. He does however eventually assist Alphamon (King Dragon) along with the others in defeating Dexmon when they arrive to help. Duke of Courage :The 2nd Royal Knight, who can give Dorumon the new Dragon Spirit necessary to save his life. After completing several tests, Zh√¨guƒÅng and the others earn the right to see him. However, he only gives them a new Dragon Spirit after they prove themselves in battle against him. Afterwards, he transforms from MedievalGallantmon into a Gallantmon X to fight Dexmon. Magna of Miracles :A Magnamon X. Appears briefly to help FƒÅng and Lu√≤ gain new powers to help fight Dexmon, and later, his \\"Power of Miracles\\" helps Zh√¨guƒÅng return to the real world. MameTyramon :Not actually a Royal Knight, but one of Duke's servants. A somewhat vicious and arrogant character, he subjects the kids to several tests. When his helmet is destroyed, he gains greater speed and power.  Villains  Kuwagamon X MegaSeadramon X & GigaSeadramon A GigaSeadramon is furious with the children when Lu√≤'s Greymon X destroys his brother MegaSeadramon X. He appeared soon after when MegaSeadramon X was defeated. GigaSeadramon attacks Lu√≤, and Zh√¨guƒÅng has Dorimon digivolve to Grademon and defeat him. SkullBaluchimon Metal Phantomon :\\"The God of Death\\", who originally pulls the kids into the Digital World so he can use their powers for himself. He steals Dorumon's Dragon Spirit to revive Dexmon, but is ultimately absorbed by the ancient Digimon himself. Dexmon :The final and main villain, the true form of the Digi-Core who was sealed away by the Royal Knights 10,000 years ago. He is revived by Metal Phantomon, and after absorbing the evil Digimon, gains power and the ability to think for himself. In the end, he fuses with the Digital World, forcing Alphamon to \\"purify him\\" and leave him in the center of the digital world. Other  Evolution/Digivolution  In the series, evolution (or Digivolution) is achieved through the generation of \\"energy spheres\\", which is formed from the human partner's will. However, if there are negative emotions involved, it can cause the partner to evolve into a savage version in a process called \\"Death-X (Dex) Evolution.\\" The most notable example of this is when L√≥ng's Dorumon warp evolves into a DexDorugoramon.  D-Cyber Digivice  The Digivice for this series is the D-Cyber. The only notable feature of the portrayal of this Digivice is that a Digimon's special attack is triggered by \\"pendulum shaking\\" on the part of the human partner.https://www.ebay.ca/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&_nkw=digimon+d+cyber External links * https://www.ebay.ca/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&_nkw=digimon+d+cyber Category:Action- adventure comics Category:Fantasy comics Category:Hong Kong comics titles Category:Digimon anime and manga ","title":"Digimon D-Cyber"},{"id":"4498910","text":"Qiao Mao () (died 190), courtesy name Yuanwei, was an official and minor warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. In 190, he joined a coalition of warlords who launched a campaign against Dong Zhuo, a tyrannical warlord who controlled the Han central government and held Emperor Xian hostage. Later that year, he was killed after getting into a dispute with Liu Dai, one of the other warlords. Life Qiao Mao was a relative of Qiao Xuan.

He subsequently deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with his younger half-brother, who became historically known as Emperor Xian. Later that year, Qiao Mao forged a letter from the Three Ducal Ministers and sent it to all the regional warlords spread throughout the Han Empire.

Retrieved 2009-12-23 poet, playwright, novelist, essayist and representative of Lithuania at the League of Nations.Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, Cynthia L. Haven. Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz. 2006p.203 His literary career began at the end of the nineteenth century during la Belle √âpoque and reached its high point in the mid-1920s with the books Ars Magna and Les Arcanes, in which he developed a highly personal and dense Christian cosmogony comparable to that of Dante in The Divine Comedy and John Milton in Paradise Lost. A solitary and unique twentieth-century metaphysician, his poems are visionary and often tormented. He was a distant cousin of Polish writer Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1980.  Life  Oscar Milosz was born in ƒåareja (Chereya), Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire, now in modern-day Belarus, where he also spent his childhood. His father, Vladislas de Lubicz Milosz, was ethnically Lithuanian, nominally Catholic, and for a time an officer in the imperial Russian army. His mother, Marie Rosalie Rosenthal, was Jewish, the daughter of a Hebrew professor at the University of Warsaw. The family spoke Polish at home. Oscar was baptized a Catholic on 2 July 1886, at St. Alexander's Church in Warsaw. In 1889, when he was 12, his parents placed him at the Lyc√©e Janson de Sailly in Paris. He began writing poems in 1894 and started to frequent artistic circles, meeting Oscar Wilde and Jean Mor√©as. After finishing at the Lyc√©e, he enrolled at the √âcole des langues orientales, where he studied Syriac and Hebrew. Oscar Milosz with the personnel of Representation of Lithuania in Paris His first book of verse, Le Po√®me des D√©cadences, appeared in 1899. In the first years of the twentieth century, Milosz travelled widely in Europe and North Africa and explored many foreign literatures. A European poet of the French language, Milosz was an excellent linguist and was fluent in French, Polish, Russian, English, German, Italian, and Spanish as well as being able to read Latin and Hebrew. Later in life, he would also learn Lithuanian and Basque. Milosz published his second poetry collection, the more accomplished Les Sept Solitudes, in 1906. He then entered into a phase of literary experimentation during which he tried his hand at a novel, L'Amoureuse Initiation, published in 1910, and three \\"mystery dramas,\\" the most popular of these plays being Miguel Ma√±ara (1913), a reworking of the Don Juan myth. During this time he also composed his third poetry collection, Les √âl√©ments (1911). On 14 December 1914, while saying his prayers at the end of an evening of intensive reading of the Bible and Emanuel Swedenborg, Milosz experienced an illumination that led him to proclaim the next day to a friend: \\"I have seen the spiritual sun.\\"Bamford (ed.), 1985, p. 449. Influenced by this vision, his poetry became more profound. He began to study the Kabbalah, and Renaissance and Baroque alchemists and thinkers like Paracelsus and Jacob Boehme. After 1916, the development of his metaphysics became his major poetic preoccupation. He began to develop a literary cosmogonic system in the tradition of Lucretius, William Blake, and Edgar Allan Poe and exposed it for the first time in the essay √âpitre √† Storge, published in La Revue de Hollande in 1917. In the early 1920s, Milosz convinced himself that his poetic cosmogony was supported by Einstein's theory of relativity, still a subject of debate. During this period, after a flirtation with \\"occult\\" reading and friends, like the numerologist Ren√© Schwaller de Lubicz, Milosz turned his back on these currents of thought and began to study medieval science and thinkers like the English scholastic Robert Grosseteste. Finally, in 1927 he took a Father Confessor and became a practicing Roman Catholic, which he remained for the last twelve years of his life.Buzaite, Saule, ‚Ä≥Psychobiography: Oskaras Mila≈°ius‚Ä≥, Lituanus (Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences), vol. 46, no. 4, Winter 2000. In 1916, during World War I, Milosz was conscripted to the Russian division of the French army and was assigned to the press corps. After the Russian Revolution of October 1917, ƒåareja was seized by the Soviets. Suddenly, access to his family fortune was cut off and Milosz needed to earn a living. Around this time he learned about the growing movement for Lithuanian independence. By the end of the war when both Lithuania and Poland were effectively independent again, Milosz chose to identify with Lithuania \\\\- even though he did not yet speak Lithuanian -- because he believed that it had been the original homeland of his ancestors in and prior to the 13th century. In 1920 when France recognized the independence of Lithuania, he was officially appointed Charg√© d'Affaires for the new state. Milosz's diplomatic career remains one of the more fascinating aspects of his legacy; his articles and correspondence in the service of the reborn Lithuanian state show a high level of nuance and rigor. In 1931 he became a French citizen and was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur. In 1939, shortly after retiring from his diplomatic post and ill with cancer, he died of a heart attack in a house he had recently purchased in Fontainebleau. He is buried in the cemetery at Fontainebleau. Every year, around the time of his birthday on May 28, a group of admirers, Les Amis de Milosz, commemorate his life and work in a ceremony at the grave site. Works Milosz was largely neglected during his lifetime. He has increasingly, however, come to be considered an important figure in French poetry. In a 1926 letter to James Chouvet, he writes: > \\"... [my] studies have taught me the only thing they could. Namely, that the > truth is one, and that some respect and love are enough to discover it in > the depths of our consciousness.\\"Buzaite, S., ‚Ä≥Psychobiography‚Ä≥. As well as being a writer of great erudition and breadth, Milosz edited three books of Lithuanian folk tales and songs.

They are based at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and fall under the command of the 2nd Marine Division and the II Marine Expeditionary Force. Subordinate units The regiment comprises three infantry battalions and one headquarters company: * Headquarters Company 8th Marines (HQ/8) * 1st Battalion, 8th Marines (1/8) * 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines (2/8) * 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines (3/8) History Early years The 8th Marine Regiment was formed on 9 October 1917, at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, during the buildup for World War I. While training for war, the command was transferred to Fort Crockett, Texas, to guard the nearby Mexican oil fields. The regiment was joined there by the 9th Marines to form the 3d Marine Brigade; the first Advance Base Force of World War I. As such, the Marines were held in reserve to establish and defend naval bases in the Atlantic Ocean or the West Indies, if required. The 8th Marines was inactivated at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 25 April 1919. A year later, the regiment was reactivated for service in Haiti, where Marines had been fighting the Cacos bandits since 1914. Through systematic patrolling which culminated in a number of brief, sharp clashes, the 8th Marines eliminated Haitian banditry that had lasted more than a hundred years. The 8th Marines was inactivated again in 1925. World War II In 1940 the regiment was formed once more, in San Diego, California. It was the first Marine regiment to deploy into the Pacific waters to Samoa. After ten months of jungle training, while defending the Samoan Islands, the regiment sailed to reinforce the engaged 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal. While there, the 8th Marines won its first Presidential Unit Citation. When the 8th arrived on Guadalcanal they were still wearing the Kelly Transitional helmet according to the book, 'Helmet for My Pillow'. Joining the 2nd Marine Division in New Zealand, the 8th Marines spent several months refitting for the Battle of Tarawa. In 76 hours the Marines seized that island and opened the door to the Japanese Empire. For its actions, the 8th Marine Regiment received its second Presidential Unit Citation. After refitting in Hawaii, the 8th Marines sailed for the Marianas, to storm the beaches of Saipan and Tinian, capturing key bases for the air war against Japan. Reinforced with artillery, the regiment later joined the 1st and 6th Divisions in the Battle of Okinawa. Post Vietnam War years In the 1980s; 28 May 1982 2nd Battalion 8th Marines under the command of LtCol. Robert B. Johnson deployed with the 32nd Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU); under the Command of Colonel James M. Mead to the Mediterranean Sea; where upon the 32nd MAU was ordered to advance to the coast of Lebanon. 15 June 1982 2nd Battalion 8th Marines evacuated the U.S. Ambassador, Staff, and 580 civilian personnel seventy kilometers North of Beirut. 25 August 1982 2nd Battalion 8th Marines along with the French, Italian and Israelis Forces evacuated the Palestinian Liberation Organization(PLO) from Beirut. 2nd Battalion 8th Marines left Beirut briefly after the PLO evacuation, but returned as a Multinational Force with the French, Italians, and British in response to the Massacre of 700 to 800 Palestinian refugees. December 1982 3rd Battalion 8th Marines relieved 2nd Battalion 8th Marines on station. 1st Battalion 8th Marines relieved 2nd Battalion 2nd Marines June 1983, and on 23 October 1st Battalion 8th Marines Barracks along with the French 8th Para Regiment Barracks were bombed. 2nd Battalion 8th Marines were returning to Beirut, and detoured to the Caribbean when they heard of the Bombing of Marine Barracks. 2nd Battalion 8th Marines invaded Grenada 25 October 1983 as the main force of Operation Urgent Fury, the successful liberation of the Island of Grenada and the rescue of American University students. Immediately after departing Grenada, 2d Battalion, 8th Marines continued their deployment to join the Multinational Peacekeeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon. They were withdrawn from Beirut on 26 February 1984, ending their duties as part of the Multinational Peacekeeping Force and resuming their commitment as the Landing Force Sixth Fleet (LF6F) Battalion Landing Team. In total, 220 marines lost their lives in the bombing of the Beirut barracks alongside 18 sailors and 3 soldiers.https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine- corps/2019/10/24/beirut-bombing-survivor-tells-his-story-and-remembers- marines-who-died/ From December 1990 to April 1991 the 8th Marines participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 2d Battalion, 8th Marines participated in Operation Provide Comfort in northern Iraq from April to July 1991. Global War on Terrorism Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, partnered with Afghan National Police, patrol through Garmsir District, Helmand province, Afghanistan, 1 June 2012 8th Marines deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in the February 2005. They operated around the city of Fallujah, Iraq. The Marines secured the city ahead of the December 2005 national elections.Alisha Ryu, \\"10 US Marines Killed Near Fallujah\\" (2 December 2005). 8th Marines redeployed to Iraq in January 2009, taking over responsibility for the western Al-Anbar province from the 5th Marines. During this period, RCT-8 continued and completed the major retrograde of equipment out of Iraq, and also continued civil affairs operations to stabilize the Area of Operation. Due to the drawdown of forces throughout the country, RCT-8's deployment was cut short and they were ordered to redeploy home in September 2009, instead of their original departure date of January 2010.http://www.mnf- iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=25001&Itemid;=128 According to CBS News, the regiment had one of the highest casualty rates during its 2009 deployment. On 7 January 2011, the Department of Defense officially announced that RCT-8 would be deploying in early 2011 to Afghanistan for approximately one year in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

(2011) ‚ÄúA non-structural, p17 protein of Potato leafroll virus co-localizes in plant phloem tissue with virus capsid protein‚Äù Phytopathology 101:6 p. S47. infects potatoes and other members of the family Solanaceae. PLRV was first described by Quanjer et al. in 1916.Loebenstein, G., Berger, P. H., Brunt, A. A., Lawson, R. H. (2001) Virus and Virus-like Diseases of Potatoes and Production of Seed-Potatoes. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands, p. 69-72. PLRV is transmitted by aphids, primarily the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. PLRV is one of the most important potato viruses worldwide but particularly devastating in countries with limited resources and management. It can be responsible for individual plant yield losses of over 50%. One estimate suggests that PLRV is responsible for an annual global yield loss of 20 million tons.Wales, S., Platt, H.W., Cattlin, N. (2008) Diseases, Pests and Disorders of Potatoes. Manson Publishing Ltd, London, p. 75-76. Symptoms include chlorosis, necrosis and leaf curling. Hosts and Symptoms PLRV infects members of the family Solanaceae. The most economically important host is the Potato, Solanum tuberosum spp. In potato, symptoms of primary infection, infection in the growing season, occurs in the youngest leaves. Leaf margins become necrotic, turning brown and purplish and curl inwards towards the center of the leaf. Secondary infection, which starts from infected potato culls, produces more severe symptoms. Leaf rolling is more apparent and the entire leaf can become chlorotic and sometimes also has a purple discoloration.Wales, S., Platt, H.W., Cattlin, N. (2008) Diseases, Pests and Disorders of Potatoes. Manson Publishing Ltd, London, p. 75-76. Necrosis of the phloem tissue particularly in the haulm is observed after onset of symptoms. Plants infected with PLRV experience stunted growth and produce smaller tubers. Infected tubers retain normal shape but experience necrosis of the vascular tissue. Necrosis of the tuber may not be apparent at harvest and can develop in storage. This usually appears as small brown spots scattered throughout the tissue. Net necrosis of potato is the result of infection by potato leaf roll virus (PLRV). This symptom is caused by the selective death and damage to cells in the vascular tissues of the tuber. The fact that only specific cells within the tuber are affected by this problem while others remain normal causes the characteristic net symptom. Infection by the virus may directly cause the damage to and death of the vascular tissues or the presence of the virus may make these sensitive tissues more susceptible to damage from other stresses. There is a strong resemblance between PLRV net necrosis and another tuber defect known as stem end discoloration (SED). Unlike PLRV, SED is believed to be a physiological disorder. The virus itself is an extremely small, nearly spherical particle (its diameter is only 0.000001 inch) which can be spread by several aphid species that colonize potato, with the green peach aphid being the most efficient. The insect vector is absolutely essential to spread because mechanical transmission, like that which occurs when the leaves of an infected plant rub on a healthy one, simply does not occur with PLRV. The infection process is actually quite complicated with this virus. First the aphid must acquire the virus by feeding on a PLRV infected plant. Then the virus must circulate from the gut of the aphid, through the circulatory system until it finally gets into the salivary glands, from which it can be excreted when the aphid feeds on healthy plants. Only after this has happened can the aphid spread the virus. This sequence of events may require 24 hr. or more to occur. Unfortunately, once an aphid becomes infected, it remains so for the rest of its life. Spread of the virus between plants within a field and between fields can be done by the winged forms of the aphid but most spread within a field, especially from infected plants to nearby, healthy ones, is accomplished by the wingless forms. Seed certification programs allow only a very small level of PLRV in certified seed. In Idaho, for instance, during the second field inspection the allowable amount of PLRV is only 0.05% for G4 seed, 0.01% for G3 and G2 and none at all allowed in nuclear and G1. Very small percentages of PLRV in seed potatoes do not normally pose any risk for the commercial producer. However, even very small percentages of virus can be a problem if green peach aphids appear very early and in abundance. In years that are very favorable for insects, like the 1996 season was, the aphid population can become so large that even a very low percentage of PLRV infected seed could result in sufficient spread to cause a problem, because as the aphid population increases, so does the probability that they will encounter an infected plant. Control of aphids with insecticide application is the only means of managing this problem in production years that are highly favorable for aphids. Seed borne infection generally results in small, stunted, badly impaired plants which have reduced yield both in tuber numbers and in tuber size. Large tubers that show the typical net necrosis symptom may well be the result of current season infection. PLRV infects other hosts including moonflower, Datura stramonium causing interveinal necrosis and hairy nightshade, Solanum villosum causing chlorosis, leafroll and leathery texture of leaves. Husk tomato, Physalis floridana symptoms include chlorosis, rolling of the leaves and stunting. PLRV infects many other plants in the family Solanacea and can also infect some non-solanaceous plants.Loebenstein, G., Berger, P. H., Brunt, A. A., Lawson, R. H. (2001) Virus and Virus-like Diseases of Potatoes and Production of Seed-Potatoes. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands, p. 69-72. Because of the wide array of symptoms that occur in different hosts, diagnosis of PLRV must be done based on the infected species. In potatoes PLRV is diagnosed by stunting and leafroll. Diagnosis of other species mentioned previously is by the above-mentioned symptoms. PLRV can be detected on site using PLRV AgriStrip-magnetic. This lateral flow test uses microbeads coated with an anti-body specific to PLRV. Virus particles are separated from the plant tissue using a powerful magnet. The PLRV AgriStrip- magnetic can detect low titers that were previously thought to be too low for traditional lateral flow tests.Altenbach, D., Bitterlin, W. (2011) ‚ÄúRapid immuno-test combined with magnetic bead technology for on-site detection of potato leafroll virus‚Äù Phytopathology 101:6 p. S6. Disease Cycle PLRV can be introduced to potatoes by planting infected seeds or by insect vectors. The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is the primary vector of PLRV. Aphids acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants. The infected phloem is taken up through the aphid stylet into the digestive system. The virus then crosses the membrane of the gut and enters the hemocoel where it then can cross the membrane into the salivary glands.Jayasinghe, Upali. ‚Äú Potato Leafroll Virus.‚Äù Technical information Bulletin 22. International Potato Center, CIP, Lima, Peru. March 1998. This process takes several hours, after which time the aphid will continue to transmit the virus for its remaining life.Davis, R.M. ‚ÄúPathogen: Potato Leafroll Virus.‚Äù UC Pest Management Guidelines. Reviewed August 2007, updated May 2008. This process is known as persistent transmission. In temperate regions, the green peach aphid is able to persist through the winter by laying eggs in woody species of the genus Prunus. Eggs hatch in early spring, and early instar aphids feed on tree phloem until summer, when they switch to more preferred herbacous hosts, including agricultural crops. During this time the green peach aphid can transmit PLRV present in weeds of the family Solanaceae to potatoes and other crops. Potato plants infected with PLRV will produced infected tubers. If infected tubers are planted they will give rise to infected plants. Aphids can also spread PLRV to tubers in storage, especially after they sprout. Winged aphids can be carried several hundred kilometers by wind currents, allowing for widespread infection.Jayasinghe, Upali. ‚Äú Potato Leafroll Virus.‚Äù Technical information Bulletin 22. International Potato Center, CIP, Lima, Peru. March 1998. Environment Because PLRV is transmitted by aphid vectors it is more prevalent in environments that are conducive to aphid development. Warm humid conditions are preferred, but aphids can thrive in a number of climates as long as it is not too hot and dry, as their soft bodies make them prone to desiccation. In the tropics, aphids persist year round but the efficiency of PLRV transmission is reduced at temperatures above 26 degrees Celsius.Jayasinghe, Upali. ‚ÄúPotato Leafroll Virus.‚Äù Technical information Bulletin 22. International Potato Center, CIP, Lima, Peru. March 1998. The optimal temperatures for the green peach aphid are between 13 and 19 degrees Celsius.Wolfenbarger, D. O. (1972) \\"Effects of temperature on mortality of green peach aphids Homoptera-Aphididae on potatoes treated with ethyl-methyl parathion.\\" Journal of Economic Entomology 65:3:881 Importance PLRV is an economically important disease due to the yield loss it can cause. Along with other aphid vectored viruses PLRV causes an annual potato loss in the U.S. of 100 million dollars.Suszkin, J. (2008) \\"Aphid pest gets \\"egged\\"\\". Agricultural Research. 56:5 p.19. Plants that are infected with the virus produce only small to medium tubers that are not preferable in market. When plants are grown from infected tubers yield can be reduced 33-50%. Since potatoes are produced by planting the tubers produced the previous season, PLRV is especially problematic in seed potato production. Plantings from infected tubers will not yield acceptable market quality potatoes and can cause a significant loss.\\"Potato Aphids\\" 2008. UC IPM Online. University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources. Thus any amount of infection is above the economic threshold. In the United States the potato industry is an important source of revenue, with the top producing states in 2009 being Idaho ($735,250,000), Washington ($627,995,000) and Wisconsin ($246,330,000).National Potato Council 2010 Potato Statistical Yearbook (May 2010) 76pp Management Since PLRV is persistently transmitted it makes for easier means of control. Studies have shown a minimum of twelve hours is required for the virus to be transmissible by an aphid. Therefore, PLRV can be controlled effectively by reducing aphid populations. Systemic and foliar insecticides can be used to prevent aphid feeding. Since virus takes several hours to be transmitted by aphids systemic insecticides are utilized and the aphid dies before it can transmit the virus. Foliar pesticides are utilized when colonizing aphid populations get too high and are useful as a knockdown method, to rapidly reduce aphid populations.Loebenstein, G., Berger, P. H., Brunt, A. A., Lawson, R. H. (2001) Virus and Virus-like Diseases of Potatoes and Production of Seed-Potatoes. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands, p. 69-72.Imidacloprid, Methamidophos and Endosulfan are commonly used in aphid control.\\"Potato Aphids\\" 2008. UC IPM Online. University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources. One study found that ethyl-methyl parathion pesticides are less effective at controlling the green peach aphid at lower temperatures. At 25 degrees Celsius aphid mortality was 95%. At 17 degrees Celsius mortality was 90%, at 10 degrees Celsius mortality was 80%, and at 7 degrees Celsius mortality was 67%. This suggests that some chemical controls are more effective at higher temperatures.Wolfenbarger, D. O. (1972) \\"Effects of temperature on mortality of green peach aphids Homoptera-Aphididae on potatoes treated with ethyl-methyl parathion.\\" Journal of Economic Entomology 65:3:881 Other management strategies include sanitation and seed certification. Cleaning any volunteer tubers from a field reduces any reservoirs that may persist. Seed certification programs test seed lots utilizing ELISA for the detection of multiple potato viruses.Zahn, Volker, Dahle, Jor, and Pastrik, Karl-Heinz \\"Validation of ELISA for the detection of potato virus antigen in sap of potato plant leaves\\" OEPP/EPPO Bulletin (2011) 41:30-38 Seed lots can then be rated by the amount of infection. Highly infected seed lots are rejected and not used the next season.

It was established on March 29, 1972 to commemorate the location of the first railway in the province of British Columbia. Geography The park is located at the western end of Seton Portage between Seton Portage Road to the southeast, and a pair of railway tracks owned by CN Rail to the northwest. The Seton River lies just beyond the railway tracks, which flows northwest from Anderson Lake into Seton Lake. The park is forested with pine and the light underbrush typical of the area's climate. Covering only , Seton Portage is the smallest provincial park in British Columbia. It is also the third smallest protected area managed by BC Parks after Canoe Islets Ecological Reserve and Ballingall Islets Ecological Reserve. History The long railway was built in 1861 for transport of miners' goods on the route to the Fraser goldfields in which the Portage was an important link (then known as Short Portage). The railway was horse-drawn in the uphill direction - a difference of only 15m between the two lakes, and used gravity for its descent. Known as Dozier's Way after its proprietor, Carl Dozier, the roadbed of the route remains today as the route of most of Portage Road from Nkiat to the \\"downtown\\" of Seton Portage to Slosh, though part of its route is preserved by the historic park(Nkiat and Slosh are two First Nations villages which are where the one-time gold rush ports of Wapping and Flushing were located). Though the route was used for heavy transit again, the early railway operated only a few years, though some transport and passenger traveled through the route, despite its becoming a backwater relative to other areas of the province and the Douglas Road became forgotten. Seton Portage received its current name in 1858, the centennial of the gold rush and the colony's creation, until which time it was known as the Short Portage - but also, with Shalalth, as \\"Seton\\". The Lillooet Cattle Trail was built through the same route as the Douglas Road but, despite an ingenious and fragile catwalk along the cliffs of eastern Seton Lake, was not usable in the long run and was abandoned and derelict by the time the Pacific Great Eastern connected the Seton communities to Lillooet in 1915. In 1972, British Columbia Railway donated the land to BC Parks with which they created Seton Portage Historic Provincial Park. An old caboose was later parked beside the park and hosted a tourist information centre for the community under a park use permit. As of November 2012, the information centre was not in use. Facilities The park features no camping or day-use facilities. Passenger service to this location is no longer available, other than a local run from Lillooet, on the Canadian National Railway line. Access is otherwise via the arduous Mission Mountain Road or the even more difficult Anderson Lake Highline Road, which are Seton Portage's and Shalalth's only road access to the outside world.

Three riders with the flags of Navarre, Ikurrina and Arrano Beltza in an homage to ETA members. The arrano beltza (Basque, 'black eagle') is an ancient Basque and Navarre symbol depicting a black heraldic eagle upon a yellow background. Today, it is mostly used by Basque nationalists as a symbol of sovereignty and independence.  History  The black eagle was originally the seal of King Sancho VII of Navarre but was later attributed to Sancho III of Navarre who, when incorporating Aragon and Castile, had under his crown all the territories of Basque culture and language, including those traditionally Castilian, since his kingdom reached from Galicia to Ribagor√ßa. From a Basque nationalist interpretation, the rule of Sancho III constitutes a historical precedent for the aspirations of the unification of the Basque- speaking territories under one independent State. From a Spanish perspective, it is one of the first attempts at forming a unified Spain. Note that the flag is a modern interpretation of the seal. There are no known flags prior to the 18th centuryBernardo Estorn√©s Lasa's Spanish article on Navarra in the Au√±amendi Entziklopedia (click on \\"NAVARRA - NAFARROA (NOMBRE Y EMBLEMAS)\\") when Father Isla describes a crimson flag with the chains and crown of the modern coat-of-arms.  Usage  This symbol is used mostly by the so-called Ezker Abertzalea (Nationalist Left). However, it is occasionally used by Spanish nationalists.The arrano beltza bears some resemblance to the flag of the 221x221px Some Spanish nationalist organisations of neo-fascist character (specifically the AUN), have on a few occasions used the arrano beltza as well, presenting it as a symbol of Spanish unity. For this idea, they allege that Sancho III ruled most of Christian Spain, from Le√≥n to Barcelona, and that he was cited as Rex Hispanorum Regum, that is, \\"King of the Kings of the Hispanians\\". Songs Arrano beltza is also a song by Basque songwriter Mikel Laboa (later covered by rock band Negu Gorriak), including the verses: {Arrano beltzarekin joan ziren joan joan Jaengo Navas de Tolosara Nafarrak eta kate kateekin itzuli etxera. |They went with the black eagle went, went to Navas de Tolosa in Ja√©n the Navarrese and returned with the chains, chains. |} It alludes to a legend about the origin of the coat of arms and flag of Navarre.

A chess prodigy, she is the youngest female player ever to qualify for the title of grandmaster and the youngest ever to win the Women's World Chess Championship. At the age of 12, Hou became the youngest player ever to participate in the Women's World Championship (Yekaterinburg 2006) and the Chess Olympiad (Torino 2006).Newsmakers, Beijing Review PEOPLE/POINTS NO.40, 2008 In June 2007, she became youngest Chinese Women's Champion ever. She achieved the titles of Woman FIDE Master in January 2004, Woman Grandmaster in January 2007, and Grandmaster in August 2008. In 2010, she won the 2010 Women's World Championship in Hatay, Turkey at age 16. She won the next three championships in which the title was decided by a match (in 2011, 2013 and 2016, with a total of ten wins to zero losses and 14 draws against three different opponents), but was either eliminated early or declined to participate in the championships in which the title was decided by a knockout tournament (in 2012, 2015 and 2017). Hou is the third woman ever to be rated among the world's top 100 players, after Maia Chiburdanidze and Judit Polg√°r. She is widely regarded as the best active female chess player, \\"leaps and bounds\\" ahead of her competitors. , she is the No. 1 ranked woman in the world, 72 points ahead of the No. 2 ranked Humpy Koneru. She was named in the BBC's 100 Women programme in 2017. Career Hou started playing chess regularly at the age of five, but was already fascinated by the game when she was three years old. Hou's father, Hou Xuejian, a magistrate, often took his young daughter to a bookstore after dinner. He noticed that the little girl liked to stare at glass chess pieces behind the window. He later bought his daughter her first chess set. The three-year-old was able to beat her father and grandmother after a few weeks. In 1999, her father engaged a chess mentor, IM Tong Yuanming, for his five-year-old daughter. Tong later said that Hou was an unusual talent, showing \\"strong confidence, distinguished memory, calculating ability and fast reaction\\". Hou herself said that she took up chess because she was fascinated by the pieces.\\"Chess grandmaster Hou, 13, is no square!\\", by Adrian Butler, Liverpool Echo, 4 September 2007 In 2003, Hou played against the chief coach of the Chinese national men's and women's chess teams, Ye Jiangchuan, for the first time. The chess master was surprised that the nine-year-old could identify almost all of his weak moves. \\"Then I knew she was an exceptional genius,\\" Ye said. That year, Hou became the youngest member of the national team and won first place at the World Youth Championship for girls under age ten. In June 2007, she became China's youngest ever national champion. She was admitted to the National Chess Center, an academy for young talented players from all over the country,WWCC 2006 Ekaterinburg, Russia.

In order to better support her chess career, her family relocated to Beijing in 2003. Hou's mother, Wang Qian, a former nurse, accompanies her daughter on the international tournament circuit. Hou was homeschooled and as a teenager listed her interests as reading and studying, and her favorite chess player as Bobby Fischer. Her mother accompanied her to many international tournaments when she was young. Life outside chess Hou has attempted to balance chess with life outside of it. She enrolled in Peking University in 2012, studying International Relations, against the wishes of her trainer. She took a full course load and participated in many extracurricular activities. She was offered a Rhodes Scholarship, and studied for a Masters of Public Policy at the Blavatnik School of Government, Oxford University. At Oxford, Hou was a member of St. Hilda‚Äôs College. Compared to the best professional male players who dedicate their lives to chess, Hou's split focus puts her at a disadvantage. These competitors give her credit for what she has achieved in spite of her lack of preparation, and for her life outside of chess. Vladimir Kramnik said: \\"If she wants to stay the best female player, she can probably do nothing. If she wants to achieve her potential, she must concentrate fully on chess.\\" Hou is aware of this as well, but nonetheless chooses to treat chess as a hobby, not a career. She said in 2018: \\"I want to be the best, but you also have to have a life.\\" In 2020, Hou became the youngest ever professor at Shenzhen University at age 26.

Views Male-female skill gap at the top-level Yifan claimed that there are many reasons for the lack of female contenders at the chess top-level. She says there is a physical aspect to chess that might advantage men, but that men generally work harder at chess than women growing up. She uses Chinese girls as an example and points out that most prefer a balanced life, prioritizing things like university and family life at the cost of working on chess. But she claims there are also external factors: girls playing chess growing up are only encouraged to compete for the girl's title, which might lower their motivation. She admits that it is difficult to measure the causes.

During the mid 1970s Footscray made the finals only twice yet failed to win on either occasion, and the club endured numerous departures of highly talented players in this period. Essendon career In 1980 Stoneham transferred to Essendon, securing a solid spot as a defender under coaches Barry Davis and Kevin Sheedy. During the 1983 VFL season, he was involved in a controversial incident against Hawthorn with Hawthorn star Robert DiPierdomenico where Stoneham was concussed after the half time siren, and assisted from the field with a black eye. He ended his career later that year, captaining a victorious Essendon reserves side to a premiership.

In the special case when is totally ordered, monotonicity of implies monotonicity of its inverse. For example, the set of integers and the set of even integers have the same order type, because the mapping n\\\\mapsto 2n is a bijection that preserves the order. But the set of integers and the set of rational numbers (with the standard ordering) do not have the same order type, because even though the sets are of the same size (they are both countably infinite), there is no order-preserving bijective mapping between them. To these two order types we may add two more: the set of positive integers (which has a least element), and that of negative integers (which has a greatest element). The open interval of rationals is order isomorphic to the rationals (since, for example, f(x) = \\\\tfrac{2x - 1}{1 - \\\\vert {2x - 1} \\\\vert} is a strictly increasing bijection from the former to the latter); the rationals contained in the half-closed intervals [0,1) and (0,1], and the closed interval [0,1], are three additional order type examples. Since order- equivalence is an equivalence relation, it partitions the class of all ordered sets into equivalence classes. Order type of well-orderings Three well- orderings on the set of natural numbers with distinct order types (top to bottom): \\\\omega, \\\\omega+5, and \\\\omega+\\\\omega. Every well-ordered set is order- equivalent to exactly one ordinal number. The ordinal numbers are taken to be the canonical representatives of their classes, and so the order type of a well-ordered set is usually identified with the corresponding ordinal. For example, the order type of the natural numbers is . The order type of a well- ordered set is sometimes expressed as .Ordinal Numbers and Their Arithmetic For example, consider the set of even ordinals less than : :V = \\\\\\\\{0,2,4,\\\\ldots;\\\\omega,\\\\omega + 2,\\\\omega + 4,\\\\ldots;\\\\omega\\\\cdot 2,\\\\omega\\\\cdot 2 + 2, \\\\omega\\\\cdot 2 + 4, \\\\omega\\\\cdot 2 + 6\\\\\\\\}. Its order type is: :\\\\operatorname{ord}(V) = \\\\omega\\\\cdot 2 + 4 = \\\\\\\\{0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots; \\\\omega, \\\\omega+1, \\\\omega+2, \\\\ldots; \\\\omega\\\\cdot 2, \\\\omega\\\\cdot 2 + 1, \\\\omega\\\\cdot 2 + 2, \\\\omega\\\\cdot 2 + 3\\\\\\\\}, because there are 2 separate lists of counting and 4 in sequence at the end. Rational numbers Any countable totally ordered set can be mapped injectively into the rational numbers in an order-preserving way. Any dense countable totally ordered set with no highest and no lowest element can be mapped bijectively onto the rational numbers in an order- preserving way.  Notation  The order type of the rationals is usually denoted \\\\eta. If a set S has order type \\\\sigma, the order type of the dual of S (the reversed order) is denoted \\\\sigma^{*}.

Life Yang Feng was a leader among the White Wave Bandits. Later, he became a subordinate of Li Jue.(ÂÇïÂ∞áÊ•äÂ•âÊú¨ÁôΩÊ≥¢Ë≥äÂ∏•Ôºå ...) Houhanshu vol. 72. In 192, Li Jue, Guo Si and other former followers of the warlord Dong Zhuo banded together and attacked the Han imperial capital, Chang'an, and seized control of the central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian. In 195, when internal conflict broke out between Li Jue and Guo Si, the former took Emperor Xian hostage while the latter took the emperor's subjects hostage to threaten each other. During this time, Yang Feng and Song Guo (ÂÆãÊûú), another of Li Jue's subordinates, plotted to assassinate their superior but failed and were forced to leave Chang'an. After three months, Zhang Ji managed to persuade Li Jue and Guo Si to make peace, and allow Emperor Xian to return to the old imperial capital, Luoyang. Yang Feng was appointed as General Who Revives Righteousness (ËààÁæ©Â∞áËªç), after which he joined Guo Si, Yang Ding (Ê•äÂÆö) and Dong Cheng in escorting the emperor back to Luoyang. Just as they reached the vicinity of Xinfeng (Êñ∞Ë±ê) and Baling (Èú∏Èôµ), Guo Si changed his mind and wanted to bring Emperor Xian to Mei County (ÈÉøÁ∏£) instead. The emperor fled to Yang Feng's camp for shelter. Yang Feng, Yang Ding and Dong Cheng protected the emperor when Guo Si tried to seize him back. Guo Si retreated after his defeat, while the emperor resumed his journey to Luoyang under Yang Feng's protection. Later in 195, Li Jue and Guo Si regretted their earlier decision to let Emperor Xian leave Chang'an, so they led their troops to pursue the emperor. Yang Feng led his troops to fight Li Jue and Guo Si but lost. He then summoned the White Wave Bandits, led by Li Le (ÊùéÊ®Ç), Han Xian, Hu Cai (ËÉ°Êâç) and others, to come to Emperor Xian's aid.

They continued on their journey towards Luoyang after that. Li Jue quickly returned with more troops and defeated Yang Feng and killed several officials who fled with Emperor Xian. The emperor escaped across the Yellow River and reached Anyi (ÂÆâÈÇë). Around August 196, Emperor Xian returned to Luoyang under the escort of Yang Feng and Dong Cheng. In recognition of their contributions, he appointed Yang Feng as General of Chariots and Cavalry (ËªäÈ®éÂ∞áËªç) and ordered him to garrison at Liang State (Ê¢ÅÂúã). Around the same time, the warlord Cao Cao led his forces into Luoyang, found Emperor Xian, and escorted him to his base in Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan), which became the new imperial capital. Yang Feng tried to stop Cao Cao but could not catch up in time. After having Emperor Xian and the new central government firmly under his control, Cao Cao led his troops to attack Yang Feng in November 196 and defeated him.

However, L√º Bu rejected the proposal after listening to Chen Gui's advice. In anger, Yuan Shu ordered his general Zhang Xun (ÂºµÂã≥), with Yang Feng and Han Xian as his subordinates, to lead troops to attack L√º Bu. L√º Bu heeded Chen Gui's suggestion and managed to induce Yang Feng and Han Xian to turn against Yuan Shu. Yang Feng and Han Xian then joined L√º Bu in attacking Yuan Shu's forces, led by Zhang Xun, and defeated the enemy. After driving back Zhang Xun, Yang Feng and Han Xian led their men to pillage several territories until Zhongli (ÈçæÈõ¢) before turning back.

The film focuses on two protagonists who are harassed by a local police investigator in the English countryside and are implicated in murders committed by zombies who have been brought to life by a farming tool designed to kill insects via ultra-sonic radiation. After being presented at the Sitges Film festival in Spain on September 30, 1974, the film was released in Italy on 28 November 1974 and was later released throughout 1975 in the United States and the United Kingdom under varying titles. In total, the film was released under more than 15 different titles internationally. In the following years, the film has become a cult picture. Plot George is taking a trip from his antique shop in Manchester to the Lake District to work on a new house with some of his friends. On the way, his Norton motorcycle is accidentally damaged by Edna while reversing her Mini Cooper at a petrol station. He demands she give him a lift to his destination, while Edna, on her way to visit her troubled sister, asks to go to the town of Southgate first, and to let George take her car to Windermere where she will later retrieve it. George agrees, but the two come to a dead end road alongside a river while searching for Edna's sister's house. George crosses the river on foot to a farm where several men from the Ministry of Agriculture are using an experimental machine in a field. While asking for directions, he inquires about their machinery, which they explain is designed to kill insects through ultra-sonic radiation. Meanwhile, while Edna waits at the car, she is attacked by a man who emerges from the river, but he disappears after she reaches George. Night falls, and Edna's drug addict sister, Katie, is getting into argument with her photographer husband, Martin, about her sister's impending arrival. Martin goes down to a waterfall near their remote cottage to take photographs, and Katie is attacked by the same man who Edna had encountered earlier. The man kills Martin, and Katie flees just as George and Edna arrive. When the three report the death, the aggressive police sergeant thinks that Katie did it. George, forced to stay in South Gate, secretly takes the roll of film from Martin's camera to a local chemist to have it developed. Katie has a breakdown and is hospitalised. At the hospital, it turns out that babies are affected too, biting people with homicidal intensity. Back at the chemist's, they collect the photos, but the dead man does not appear in any of the pictures; the man, it turns out, is a local vagrant who drowned in the river. The sergeant arrives and takes photos and, when the couple leaves, sends one of his officers, PC Craig, to trail them. They go to the graveyard and in a room in the chapel find a half-eaten meal. Following noises to a crypt, they come across a murdered man and are locked in by the vagrant zombie, who brings the other bodies to life by touching their eyes with his blood-stained fingers. The pair manages to make a hole they can escape from and Edna does, only to find herself in a pit while the zombies have hold of George's feet. Meanwhile, PC Craig turns up and helps Edna out of the pit. George manages to get free and follows them, with the zombies chasing all three of them. They lock themselves in a room but are trapped there, and Craig soon finds that his gun is of no use. He makes a dash for the police radio he has dropped outside but is caught by the zombies who eviscerate him and begin eating his organs. The dead break into their room and in desperation George throws a lit oil lamp at them. It smashes and the zombies burst into flame. The two escape to their car and Edna is sent off to tell the police. George plans to use the unmarked police car to go and smash the machine but it has no key so he runs off. At the machine, the farmer and two machine men do not believe George and reveal that the machine is now working up to a five miles radius. They try to stop him, but he smashes the machine and they drive off to get away from \\"the mad man\\". The sergeant has found Craig and the caretaker's bodies, and thinking they may be devil worshippers, issues orders \\"to shoot to kill\\" George and Edna. He is then told that George has deliberately wrecked the machine. Edna has arrived at her brother-in-law's farm only to be met by Martin, who is now a zombie, but she manages to run over him as she escapes. George finds her, drops her off at a petrol station and drives off with a large can of petrol. George is caught in a police trap and Martin's body is taken back to the hospital. In a field, the machine is repaired and switched on again, which brings to life a number of bodies in the nearby morgue. George escapes in a police car and finds Edna has been taken to the hospital, where the local morgue is. She is being sedated while George is now being chased by the police as he drives to the hospital where the zombies are now killing people, including Katie who as a zombie tries to kill her sister. George arrives and starts setting fire to zombies but it turns out that he was too late to save Edna and as she suddenly attacks him, he pushes her into a room, which is now burning. George is then shot four times by the over-zealous police sergeant. Everything is over as far as he is concerned now and the sergeant heads to a room at the hotel in South Gate for the night. After shooting him down in cold blood, the sergeant wishes he would come alive again so he could shoot him again. He gets his wish as zombie George is waiting for him in his room, but now bullets won't stop him. In a field nearby, the machine continues working.

The scenes featuring the outside of the hospital were shot at Barnes Hospital in Cheadle, Greater Manchester. Some scenes were filmed in the Peak District in Derbyshire, not far from Sheffield. The church scenes were shot in Hathersage, while other scenes were shot in Castleton and Dovedale. The opening montage was filmed in Manchester city centre. Additional photography took place at Camelot Castle in Tintagel, Cornwall. Release The film premiered in Spain on 30 September 1974, in Italy on 28 November 1974, and was released in the United States in 1975 under the title Don't Open the Window, frequenting the drive-in circuits and cinemas paired as a double feature with The Last House on the Left (1972). The film was released in the United Kingdom under its title The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue, despite the fact that the film takes place in South Gate, not Manchester. While there are claims that a scene in which a zombie eats an eyeball was filmed, no such scene exists in any surviving print of the film, according to the liner notes of the Blue Underground DVD release. During the scene in which Craig is eaten, the female zombie reaches down toward Craig's eyeball, but before anything happens, a seemingly sloppy edit cuts to a long shot of all the zombies feasting. It is part of the DVD Stephen Romano Presents Shock Festival, which was released on 8 January 2010 in the United States.DVD Verdict Review - Stephen Romano Presents Shock Festival According to Edgar Wright, the promotion of the film during its exhibition in the United States was one of the inspirations for the fake trailer Don't, which appears in the 2007 release Grindhouse. Home media The film was released for the first time on video and DVD in the U.S in 2000 by Anchor Bay Entertainment under the Let Sleeping Corpses Lie title. The DVD release was available in a standard edition as well as a limited edition collector's tin containing bonus film stills, a booklet of production notes, and a fake toe tag styled after the film. Both editions featured a foreword and extensive interview with director Jorge Grau. After the Anchor Bay release of the film went out of print, the disc was re-released by Blue Underground in 2005. In 2008, Blue Underground released the film yet again, only this time in a special edition DVD and Blu-ray under the Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue title. On 27 June 2019, Synapse Films announced an upcoming Blu-ray release featuring a new 4K resolution scan of the original 35mm film negatives . It was released on September the 1st in a limited steelbook edition of 6 000 units. Reception From a contemporary review, Verina Glaessner of the Monthly Film Bulletin said the film was extremely close to Night of the Living Dead but praised the direction of Jorge Grau, referring to him as a \\"director with genuine talent for the macabre mood and unsettling detail\\" Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 80% of fourteen surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 7.2/10. Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle called it \\"surprisingly effective\\" and said it has \\"perhaps the best zombies in a year of very good zombies\\". Glenn Kay, who wrote Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide, said that it foreshadowed the later Italian zombie films of the 1980s. Kay called it \\"the most effective and disturbing Spanish film of the period\\".

His father, Dong He, also served as an official in Shu. Dong Yun was one of four persons who held positions equivalent to a head of government in Shu from 221 to 253; the other three were Zhuge Liang, Jiang Wan and Fei Yi. Family background Dong Yun's ancestors were originally from Jiangzhou (Ê±üÂ∑û; in present-day Chongqing), but they migrated to Zhijiang County () in Nan Commandery (), which is present-day Zhijiang, Hubei, and designated Zhijiang as their ancestral home.(Ëë£ÂíåÂ≠óÂπºÂÆ∞ÔºåÂçóÈÉ°ÊûùÊ±ü‰∫∫‰πüÔºåÂÖ∂ÂÖàÊú¨Â∑¥ÈÉ°Ê±üÂ∑û‰∫∫„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 39.

In 227, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Shu, mobilised military forces from throughout Shu in preparation for a large-scale campaign against Shu's rival state Wei in the following year. As the troops gathered at the staging area in Hanzhong Commandery, Zhuge Liang was worried that Liu Shan was still young and not mature enough to make good judgments. He thus decided to put Dong Yun in charge of internal affairs in the Shu capital Chengdu because he believed that Dong Yun would perform his duties in a professional and impartial manner.(‰∏ûÁõ∏‰∫ÆÂ∞áÂåóÂæÅÔºå‰ΩèÊº¢‰∏≠ÔºåÊÖÆÂæå‰∏ªÂØåÊñºÊò•ÁßãÔºåÊú±Á¥´Èõ£Âà•Ôºå‰ª•ÂÖÅÁßâÂøÉÂÖ¨‰∫ÆÔºåÊ¨≤‰ªª‰ª•ÂÆÆÁúÅ‰πã‰∫ã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 39.

As his colleague Guo Youzhi, who also held the position of a Palace Attendant, tended to be mild-tempered and non-confrontational when dealing with people, the burden of advising the emperor Liu Shan and speaking up on difficult issues largely rested on Dong Yun's shoulders. Dong Yun performed his duties well and did his best to plan ahead and preempt problems that could possibly arise.(Êî∏‰πãÊÄßÁ¥†ÂíåÈ†ÜÔºåÂÇôÂì°ËÄåÂ∑≤„ÄÇÁçªÁ¥ç‰πã‰ªªÔºåÂÖÅÁöÜÂ∞à‰πãÁü£„ÄÇÂÖÅËôï‰∫ãÁÇ∫Èò≤Âà∂ÔºåÁîöÁõ°Âå°Êïë‰πãÁêÜ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 39. Objecting to Liu Shan's plan to expand his harem When Liu Shan wanted to have more concubines, Dong Yun pointed out that his imperial harem was already full and reminded him that according to historical precedent a ruler should have no more than 12 women in his harem. He also firmly refused to carry out the emperor's order to search for more women to join the harem.

When Dong Yun learnt about this, he openly criticised the emperor for showing favouritism towards Huang Hao and, at the same time, severely reprimanded the eunuch for his behaviour.

Chen Zhi then formed an alliance with the eunuch Huang Hao to dominate the political scene in Shu. Both of them shared power until Chen Zhi died in 258, leaving Huang Hao solely in control. Since Chen Zhi became one of his most favoured officials, Liu Shan gradually began to resent Dong Yun and see him as \\"arrogant and disrespectful\\".

In 1986, Charrette introduced Ral Partha's 53-9xx Bushido, an expansion of his earlier line., Bob Charrette Games, Accessed November 23, 2008. Bushido coincided with TSR, Inc.'s 1985 release of Oriental Adventures supplements, a gaming world that resembled the one crafted by Charrette and Hume in 1979. At the time integrated campaign worlds such as Games Workshop's Warhammer Fantasy Battle were showing early success, Ral Partha introduced the \\"Chaos Wars\\" theme into their 1986 and 1987 product lines.Ral Partha 1987 Catalog. Ral Partha Enterprises, Inc. It was the first step toward unifying a collection of disparate product lines into an integrated game world. Charrette added a fantasy component to Ral Partha's existing Rules According to Ral for medieval battles. It was released in 1987 as part of a boxed set Rules According to Ral: Chaos Wars., Board Game Geek, Ral Partha Games, Accessed November 24, 2008., TMP: Chaos Wars, Accessed November 23, 2008. Chaos Wars unified existing product lines and their packaging was marked with stickers. Among these sets were Charrette's popular Fangs of Fury Beastmen. Still Nascent, the Chaos Wars theme, was dropped in 1988 to promote a new contract for a line of official miniatures for TSR, Inc.'s Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. As Ral Partha became engaged with TSR, Charrette solidified his relationship with FASA. In 1988, he joined his longtime partner Paul R. Hume and others to construct FASA's 1989 Shadowrun game world. Charrette provided design elements and artwork for Shadowrun and sculpted a line of figures produced by Grenadier Models Inc. While at Grenadier, Charrette also crafted a line of miniatures for Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game (by West End Games), Lost Lands range of dinosaurs and 15 mm Warlord ranges.The Grenadier Bulletin, vol. 2.1, Summer 1993, Kim Eastland, editor As the creative focus of Grenadier Models Inc. moved to the United Kingdom in 1991 and 1992, FASA moved its production of Shadowrun figures to Ral Partha. Charrette had quickly become an integral member of FASA's creative team. In 1989, he expanded his design concepts for FASA games into supporting novelizations. Over the next six years, Charrette produced nine novels for FASA's Shadowrun, Battletech and Mechwarrior game worlds. As FASA's attention turned to video games, Charrette wrote Strange World of John Reddy Trilogy (1994-1995) for Warner Books, Chronicle of Aelwyn Trilogy (1996-1997) for Harper Collins and two Interstellar Defense League (1999, 2004) novels for Eos and under the pseudonym \\"Richard Fawkes.\\" In 2001, Charrette returned to game design and began Parroom Enterprises, LLC. and miniature and games company which offers miniatures, games and supplements with fantasy themes inspired by the Victorian and medieval Japanese periods.

They are most famous for being the original working site of John Wilkinson. They were also the first site in the world to use a new way of boring holes in cannon and steam engine cylinders. History Ironworking began at Bersham around 1640, and evidence shows that the cannon for the Royalists in the English Civil War were made there. In the 18th century, Isaac Wilkinson bought the ironworks and ran it for a considerable number of years. The main product was cannon, although the process to make them in iron was difficult, and cannonballs often became stuck in the barrel, leading to explosions. When Isaac's son John Wilkinson took over, he employed a boring machine to accurately make a smooth bore cannon, which became so popular that cannons produced using this technique were used in the American War of Independence and the Napoleonic wars. As well as cannon, the smooth bore machine could make cylinders for Boulton & Watt steam engines, leading Wilkinson to enter into a partnership with Watt to make the cylinders. However, Watt discovered Wilkinson had been marketing his own black market steam engines on the side, and the partnership was therefore terminated. With Europe and the world returning to peace, the market for cannon was lost. The space to expand at Bersham had run out, and Wilkinson needed to move on. He bought a house and estate at nearby Brymbo and built a blast furnace there, at what would later become Brymbo Steelworks. John Wilkinson had fallen out with his brother William, who raised a small gang to destroy Bersham Ironworks. Upon hearing this, John Wilkinson also raised a gang and helped the destruction: he was only too happy to destroy the mill which was causing him a loss. Only three structures survived: the mill building; the building which housed the smooth bore machine; and a lime kiln. After this, the site was leased to a family who opened a paper mill on the site. This did not last a long time, however, and the site was left derelict. The site on the southern bank of the River Clywedog had been completely destroyed, while the original works were in a state of decay. The site passed into agricultural use, and the \\"Mill building\\" became a mill, complete with a water wheel, still intact today. Most of the mill building has new red brick roof built on the old sandstone walls. The octagonal building is where the casting of cannon took place, as well as the iron production for them Excavation and debate Between 1987 and 1991, extensive excavations were carried out on the site, and revealed all the foundations of the original buildings and the rear wall of the engine house. They also revealed a lime kiln, with lime on the walls. Another excavation showed it was a blast furnace, as pig iron was found around it. This opened debate to what it actually was, and the debate is taught in local schools. Another find during the excavations was a wooden railway. The world's first excavated wooden waggonway, that led from a site near Minera Limeworks to a shelf above the works, presumably for tipping of lime, needed for the ironmaking process. The piece of track, carbonised, still rests at the museum inside the mill building. Restoration and preservation Now that the historical importance of Bersham was recognised, Wrexham Council put the site forward for preservation as the Bersham Heritage Centre. The nearby Bersham School was reopened as an extensive museum dedicated to local history and Bersham Ironworks, and holds the remaining smooth bore cutting piece from the machine. The Mill building was restored and opened as a secondary museum, and contains artefacts such as the wooden waggonway and several pieces from the excavations, with a guided tour of them all. Most recently, the building that made the cannon's smooth bores was given a new roof and internal scaffolding to reinforce the structure. Now the site is earmarked for more funding by the Welsh Government.

By studying experts such as firefighters in their natural environment, he discovered that laboratory models of decision making could not describe it under uncertainty. His recognition primed decision (RPD) model has influenced changes in the ways the Marines and Army train their officers to make decisions. Klein received his B.A. in Psychology from City College of New York (1964) and his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Pittsburgh (1969). He listed his main influences as Hubert Dreyfus, Adriaan de Groot, and Karl Duncker in an October 2013 interview with Bob Morris. Since 2009, Klein has been a Senior Scientist at MacroCognition LLC. He spent the first phase of his career in academia as an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Oakland University (1970‚Äì1974). He also spent a few years as Associate Professor of Psychology at Wilberforce University in Ohio. The second phase was spent working for the government as a research psychologist for the U.S. Air Force (1974‚Äì1978). The Arab oil embargo of 1973 meant that pilots needed to do more of their training in simulators, and Klein began his investigations into the way people develop expertise. The third phase began in 1978 when he founded his own R&D; company, Klein Associates, to study a range of topics that are now described as the Naturalistic Decision Making framework. Klein Associates grew to 37 people by the time he sold it to Applied Research Associates (ARA) in 2005. During this third phase, Dr. Klein developed a Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) model in 1985 to describe how people actually make decisions in natural settings. This research was subsequently incorporated in Army doctrine for command and control. He presented a PreMortem method of risk assessment in 1998. In 2007, he developed a naturalistic model of sensemaking, the Data/Frame model. In 2009, he presented a Management by Discovery account of how people plan when faced with ill- defined goals. He described a multi-path model of insight in 2011. He has led teams that developed several methods of cognitive task analysis for uncovering the tacit knowledge that goes into decision making and for studying cognition in complex settings, including the Critical Decision Method and the Knowledge Audit. He was one of the leaders of a team that redesigned the White House Situation Room. In 2015, Gary founded ShadowBox LLC, a cognitive skills training company. The ShadowBox Training Method originated from a Master's thesis in 2008, conducted by now-retired fire battalion chief, Neil Hintze. Gary and Neil worked together to refine this method for training cognitive skill development. Klein, G., & Borders, J. (2016). The ShadowBox approach to cognitive skills training: An empirical evaluation. Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making, 10(3), 268-280. The goal of the ShadowBox method is to provide a flexible, scenario-based training technique, that allows trainees to see the world through the eyes of experts ‚Äî without the experts having to be present. Klein and others report that ShadowBox training has been employed in the military, law enforcement, healthcare, social services, and petrochemical domains. Borders, J., Polander, N., Klein, G., & Wright, C. (2015). ShadowBox‚Ñ¢: Flexible training to impart the expert mindset. Procedia Manufacturing, 3, 1574-1579.

Proserpine is the Latin spelling of Persephone, a goddess married to Hades, god of the underworld. According to some accounts, she had a garden of ever blooming flowers (poppies) in the underworld. The Greek and Roman festivals honoring her and her mother, Ceres, emphasized Proserpine's return to the upper world in spring. According to the myths which talk of Persophone's Pearls, bringing visitors for lonely Persephone, these poppies induce waking sleep if picked and travelers forget their purpose, trapped wandering the underworld until they no longer are touching these flowers. In Swinburne's poems, however, the emphasis is on her role as goddess of death and eternal sleep. There are twelve stanzas in the poem. Each stanza is an \\"octave stanza\\" of eight lines, and all of the stanzas have the same internal pattern of rhymes. This rhyme scheme is recognized as a trimeter, with the pattern ABABCCCB, placing stress at the end of the poem where the three Cs rhyme and when Bs rhymes with the start of the poem. The rhyme scheme reflects Algernon Charles Swinburne's emphasis on the last line of each stanza, breaking it up from the rest of the poem, creating a harmonious ring to the feminine ending of each stanza. Diction is another crucial aspect to Swinburne's poem because it conveys the tone and feelings deeper than the writing. In \\"The Garden of Proserpine\\", the Victorian Crisis of Faith is an underlying issue that Swinburne uses strong, emphasizing diction and metaphors to convey Proserpine‚Äôs feelings challenging Christianity and asserting his values of paganism and masochism. Phrases such as \\"who gathers all things mortal; with cold immortal hands\\" and \\"Here life has death for neighbour\\" are examples of the specific diction used to portray a negative tone toward religion, linking directly to the theme of life and death of the poem, as Proserpine is a symbol of the threshold between life and death. ‚ÄúThe Garden of Proserpine‚Äù was also written as part of his first series of Poems and Ballads in 1866, depicting the spirit and form of Greek tragedy, including more of his most popular poems such as ‚ÄúDolores‚Äù. History \\"The Garden of Proserpine\\" brings up various questions commonly accompanying the Crisis of Faith of the Victorian era involving what happens after death. The Crisis of Faith was the response to new scientific evidence that contradicted the long-accepted claims of the Church of England. It resulted in a growing sense of secularism and a sense of vulnerability by the people. The question of what happens after death was one of the church's biggest defenses to this growing secularity, as faith guaranteed immortality after death. Swinburne was a strong advocate of aestheticism, and believed that art should be able to exist independently of political and moral ideologies. This concept was often referred to as ‚Äúart for art‚Äôs sake.\\" Swinburne once announced that his poetic theory \\"insists upon the uninhibited exploration of all issues and experiences relevant to comprehensively prophetic treatment of the human condition\\". In Garden of Proserpine, we see elements of aestheticism and this applied poetic theory in the fact that it works to challenge Christianity and Pagan religions. \\"The Garden of Proserpine\\" works to challenge these religions by displaying a godless afterlife, tormented only by the blind will to live. This lyric expresses feelings validated by Swinburne's pessimistic philosophy. Proserpine is the goddess of eternal death, which by nature overpowers the other gods. However, she is not actively powerful considering she represents nothingness herself. The Garden of Proserpine represents a sense of harmony, calm, and oblivion that only truly exists in this realm of nothingness. It is said to symbolize \\"the brief total pause of passion and thought after tempestuous pleasures when the spirit, without fear or hope of good things or evil, hungers and thirsts only after the perfect sleep\\". This poem celebrates the finality of death and the nothingness that lies beyond Persephone's welcoming arms, making a stark contrast to the beliefs of leading religions during this time.  Critical response  During his years as a journalist, John Morley famously described that Swinburne was always either ‚Äúthe vindictive apostle of a crushing and iron shod despair or else the libidinous laureate of a pack of satyrs‚Äù and that his poem ‚ÄúThe Garden of Proserpine‚Äù displayed what kind of person Morley thought he was. In a contradicting book called \\"Persephone Rises, 1860-1927\\" by Margot Kathleen Louis, she presents that not everyone thought the same as Morley did about Swinburne and the poem. \\"In the 1870s, Swinburne and Dante Gabriel Rossetti had a close friendship. The painting of a picture of Proserpine with a pomegranate in her hand done by Rossetti may have well been influenced by Swinburne's poem. He also wrote a sonnet to accompany the painting.\\" Martha Hale Shackford states in her article \\"Swinburne and Delavigne\\"(1918), that his poem has \\"long been a favorite, for its subtle cadences have elusive, indefinable melody, and the dim beauty of Proserpine's realm is a masterpiece of descriptive art.\\" In the same article review, Shackford compares Swinburne‚Äôs poem to Casimir Delavigne‚Äôs poem \\"Les Limbes\\". According to Shackford, Swinburne \\"derived some of his inspiration in the writing of his poem from Delavigne's\\". Most of the parts of Swinburne's poem, he borrows many of Delavigne‚Äôs ideas, modifies them and makes them his own. Shackford writes, \\"the relationships between the two poems are summed up as this; The theme is the lower or underworld, both devote many stanzas to the description of the underworld, the development of theme is proceeded by descriptions of natural aspects to the description of the listless beings who inhabit the underworld, and that both conclude the third section depicting a central dominate feminine figure.\\"  In other media  The poem is mentioned in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (where the first line of the poem, \\"Here, where the world is quiet\\", was slightly modified to become the motto of the secret organization V.F.D.) and The Lightning Thief. It is also quoted at the end of episode 2 of season 3 of Netflix's adaptation of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. This poem is also quoted by Adam West and Linda Evans in the first episode entitled ‚ÄúSilent Bottle‚Äù of the 4th season t.v. series ‚Äú Big Valley‚Äù. A portion of the poem is quoted, and plays a pivotal role, in the novel Martin Eden by Jack London. The poem serves as an inspiration and is quoted in Frank Belknap Long's short story \\"Step Into My Garden\\" published in August 1942 in the pulp magazine Unknown Worlds. A portion of the poem was also used in the Bat Masterson TV episode Wanted: Alive Please of 26 May 1960. It is also mentioned in A. S. Byatt's book Possession. In 1899, the young English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams put to music several poems, for soprano, chorus and full orchestra, into a 25-minute piece 'The Garden of Proserpine', work that had to wait 112 years for a public performance. It was recorded in 2010 and released on CD in the year 2013. Many British composers (Parry, Stanford, Bantock, Bax, etc.) seem to have been inspired by Swinburne's writing as well.

He began to work on the county records held at Haverfordwest in 1931 and he made a report to the county council in 1936.Independent obituary He then secured an appointment in the National Library of Wales, 1936-1939. Following war service and subsequent work on the official history of the Sicilian and Italian campaigns, he was appointed the first County Archivist of Carmarthenshire, serving from 1958 to 1973. He had married Ethel Charles in 1932: they had two sons and two daughters. Jones died in Carmarthen in 1993 aged 85 and was commemorated at the Church of St Benet Paul's Wharf, a Welsh Anglican church in the City of London which has been the religious home of the College of Arms since 1555. Military career Jones was commissioned into 4th Battalion, The Welch Regiment, but was subsequently transferred to the Pembroke Yeomanry. He entered active service in 1939, and later took part in the North African landings and Battle of Beja, for which he was mentioned in despatches. He later fought in the Sicilian campaign and landing, then after landing at Salerno fought in the Italian campaign up to the Battle of Monte Cassino as second in command of the regiment. He was subsequently posted as a General Staff Officer to the War Cabinet Offices, Historical Section, where he wrote the Official War Record for the Sicilian and Italian Campaigns. He was later appointed Battery Commander in the Surrey Yeomanry (Queen Mary's Regiment). Heraldic career In 1963 the office of Wales Herald of Arms Extraordinary was revived, in anticipation of the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales, and Francis Jones appointed. (The last recorded reference to a Wales Herald was in the late fourteenth century.) In this capacity he was on the Earl Marshal's staff for the State funeral of Winston Churchill, and officiated at the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969. Over the next 30 years he participated in State ceremonial with the officers of arms in ordinary of the College of Arms on occasions such as the State Opening of Parliament and the Garter service. Writing career Jones was a prolific writer with several hundred articles, essays and books published. He also appeared on BBC radio and television programs.

It is the sister paper of the English language daily, Gulf Daily News. History and profile The first issue of Akhbar Al Khaleej was published on 1 February 1976. It is one of the Bahrain's oldest daily papers. The first editor-in-chief and founder was Mahmood Al Mardi and its staff composed of mainly Egyptian, Sudanese, and Bahraini journalists. As of 2006 Anwar Abdul Rahman was the head of the paper. He also served as its editor in chief. The publisher is Dar Al Hilal which also publishes Gulf Daily News. The daily is published in broadsheet format. The 1998 circulation of the daily was 25,000 copies and it was 37,000 copies in 2013. Political position The paper is known to be close to Bahrain‚Äôs main leftist opposition party, National Democratic Action and its columnists include some of the country's most prominent leftists such as Sameera Rajab and Mahmood Al Gassab, who is a leading member of the Jami'at al-Tajammu' al-Qawmi al-Dimuqrat, one of the four opposition societies to the government. With its Arab nationalist stance, the newspaper has led condemnation of the United States' invasion of Iraq, and has been particularly critical of those Iraqis who have cooperated with the American backed political order: Samira Rajab in 2005 dismissed Iraqi Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani as an 'American general'. This resulted in death threats towards Ms Rajab from Shia Islamists ‚Äì who hold the Iraqi cleric in high regard ‚Äì and brought to the surface political fissures in the alliance of Shia Islamists and ex-Marxists that had come together to oppose the 2002 Constitution. Juan Cole on his Informed Comment website discussed the issue: > Al-Hayat reports that Samirah Rajab published an op-ed in the Khalij Times > [sic] after the recent Iraqi elections in which she referred to Grand > Ayatollah Ali Sistani as \\"General Sistani\\" and complained that the Shiite > cleric had legitimated the foreign military occupation of Iraq by supporting > the elections and by helping pacify the country for the Americans.

February 2005 On the other hand, the paper is considered to be pro-government. Controversy In June 2009, the Ministry of Culture of Bahrain ordered that Akhbar Al Khaleej suspend publication for violating press laws; local sources alleged that it was a response to an article by Samira Rajab, which had attacked Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime in light of the Iranian presidential election and related protests.Bahrain closes paper in Iran row BBC 22 June 2009.

The commutative Banach algebra and Hardy space H‚àû consists of the bounded holomorphic functions on the open unit disc D. Its spectrum S (the closed maximal ideals) contains D as an open subspace because for each z in D there is a maximal ideal consisting of functions f with :f(z) = 0. The subspace D cannot make up the entire spectrum S, essentially because the spectrum is a compact space and D is not. The complement of the closure of D in S was called the corona by , and the corona theorem states that the corona is empty, or in other words the open unit disc D is dense in the spectrum.

Clark was a pioneer in the field of scuba diving for research purposes. In addition to being regarded as an authority in marine biology, Clark was popularly recognized and used her fame to promote marine conservation. Early life and education Eugenie Clark was born and raised in New York City. Her father, Charles Clark, died when Eugenie was almost two years old, and her mother, Yumico Motomi, later married Japanese restaurant owner Masatomo Nobu. Clark attended elementary school in Woodside, Queens, and graduated from Bryant High School in Queens, New York. She was the only student of Japanese descent in her schools. From an early age, Clark was passionate about marine science, with many of her school reports covering topics in marine biology. An initial visit to the New York Aquarium at Battery Park inspired Clark to return to the aquarium every Saturday thereafter, fascinated by marine animals. The work of naturalist William Beebe further inspired Clark to become an oceanographer. Academic and scientific life Eugenie Clark received a Bachelor of Arts in zoology from Hunter College (1942). During summers, she studied at the University of Michigan Biological Station, and prior to graduate school, she worked for Celanese Corporation as a chemist. Eugenie initially sought to attend graduate school at Columbia University, but her application was rejected out of fear that she would eventually choose to leave her scientific career in order to focus on raising children. Undaunted, Clark went on to earn both a Master of Arts (1946) and Doctorate of Zoology (1950) from New York University. During her years of graduate study, Clark carried out research at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts, and at the Lerner Marine Laboratory in Bimini. In 1949, under an Office of Naval Research program to undertake scientific research in Micronesia, Clark carried out fish population studies in Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Palau islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Caroline Islands. After completing doctoral research, Clark received a Fulbright Scholarship to pursue ichthyological studies at the Marine Biological Station in Hurghada, on the northern Red Sea Coast of Egypt. These experiences were discussed in Clark's first book, Lady with a Spear (1953), the writing of which was supported in part by a Eugenie Saxton Memorial Fellowship and a Breadloaf Writers' Fellowship. The book was a popular success. Anne and William H. Vanderbilt, fans of Lady with a Spear who owned an estate in southwestern Florida, invited the biologist to speak at a public school in Englewood, Florida, in 1954. After Clark delivered a presentation on Red Sea fish, the attendees revealed that they had encountered many similar animals in local waters and were interested in learning more about them. Subsequently, the Vanderbilts built a lab for Clark in the area. It was named the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory in 1955.  Work at Cape Haze  At the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory, Clark worked with a local fisherman named Beryl Chadwick, who was experienced in catching sharks. Chadwick was Clark's only assistant at the time of the lab's founding. The lab's first request for shark research came from John H. Hellen, director of the New England Institute for Medical Research. As the laboratory's activities began to be published in scientific journals, requests from other researchers began to pour into the lab. Researchers from around the world came to study in Cape Haze. One of the visiting researchers at Cape Haze Laboratory was Sylvia Earle, who was then working on her dissertation research on algae at Duke University. Earle assisted Clark in creating a herbarium by depositing duplicate specimens into the laboratory's reference collection. While at Cape Haze, Clark conducted a number of behavioral, reproductive, and anatomical experiments on sharks and other fish. She frequently scuba dived in the local waters, studying various organisms. On these dives, Clark often utilized the glass jar catching technique popularized by Connie Limbaugh, then the Chief Diver at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. These jars allowed Clark to transport unknown specimens back to the lab for further study. ] The Cape Haze Laboratory moved to Siesta Key, Florida, in 1960. Scientists continued to visit the laboratory, including chemists from the Dow Chemical Company. In 1962, Clark participated in the Israel South Red Sea Expedition, which set up a camp on one of the Eritrean islands of the Dahlak Archipelago. Her studies focused not only on sharks but also on other, mainly large pelagic species. In 1966, Clark left Cape Haze for a faculty position at the City University of New York. In 1968, she became an instructor at the University of Maryland, College Park. While at the University of Maryland, Clark received many accolades, including three fellowships, five scholarships, and six medals. Clark officially retired from the University of Maryland in 1999 but taught one class in the zoology department each semester for several years. Clark returned to the Cape Haze Laboratory, now renamed the Mote Marine Laboratory, in 2000. She worked there as Senior Scientist, Director Emerita, and Trustee until her death in Sarasota, Florida, of lung cancer on February 25, 2015. Clark was an active researcher and diver throughout her entire life, conducting her last dive in 2014 and publishing its results in January 2015, with additional research still undergoing review at the time of her death.  Personal life  Clark was married five times, the first four ending in divorce: Jideo Umaki from 1942 to 1947, Ilias Themistokles Konstantinu from 1950 to 1967, writer Chandler Brossard from 1967 to 1969, and Igor Klatzo in 1970. She was married to Henry Yoshinobu Kon from 1997 to his death in 2000.  Legacy  The Shark Lady (Clark) authored two books, Lady with a Spear (1953) and The Lady and the Sharks (1969), as well as over 175 scientific articles. Clark was an avid supporter of marine conservation and many of her popular publications and public appearances focused on dispelling assumptions about shark behavior and intelligence in an effort to prevent the killing of sharks and encourage the preservation of marine environments. Publications from within this body of work document that she was the first person to train sharks to press targets, as well as the first scientist to develop ‚Äútest tube‚Äù babies in female fish. She also discovered that the Moses sole produces a natural shark repellent, which has since been employed by researchers aiming to prevent harmful interactions between sharks and humans. Clark's observation of numerous \\"sleeping\\" sharks during her research dives helped to prove sharks do not need to move in order to breathe. Over her decades of research, Clark conducted over 70 submersible dives and led more than 200 field research expeditions around the world. She worked on 24 television specials and helped create the first IMAX film.  Awards and honors  Clark received three honorary D.Sc. degrees from the University of Massachusetts, Long Island University, and the University of Guelph. She has been inducted into both the Florida Women's Hall of Fame and the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame. She was the 1987 recipient in the Science category of a NOGI, which is awarded annually by the Academy of Underwater Arts and Sciences and is the oldest, and considered to be the most prestigious award in the diving world. Clark has also received accolades from the National Geographic Society, the Explorers Club, the Underwater Society of America, the American Littoral Society, the Women Divers Hall of Fame, the American Society of Oceanographers. In 1975, she received the Gold Medal of the international Society of Woman Geographers for her studies of shark reproduction and behavior. She has been written about in many books, including The Shark Lady, by Ann McGovern. including extensive bibliography Several species of fish have been named in her honor: Callogobius clarki (Goren), Sticharium clarkae (George and Springer), Enneapterygius clarkae (Holleman), Atrobucca geniae (Ben-Tuvia and Trewavas), and Squalus clarkae, also known as Genie's dogfish.

Film poster The Navigator is a 1924 American comedy film directed by and starring Buster Keaton. The film was written by Clyde Bruckman and co-directed by Donald Crisp. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Plot Wealthy Rollo Treadway (Buster Keaton) suddenly decides to propose to his neighbor across the street, Betsy O'Brien (Kathryn McGuire), and sends his servant to book passage for a honeymoon sea cruise to Honolulu. When Betsy rejects his sudden offer, however, he decides to go on the trip anyway, boarding without delay that night. Because the pier number is partially covered, he ends up on the wrong ship, the Navigator, which Betsy's rich father (Frederick Vroom) has just sold to a small country at war. Agents for the other small nation in the conflict decide to set the ship adrift that same night. When Betsy's father checks up on the ship, he is captured and tied up ashore by the saboteurs. Betsy hears his cry for help and boards the ship to look for him, just before it is cut loose. The Navigator drifts out into the Pacific Ocean. The two unwitting passengers eventually find each other. At first, they have great difficulty looking after themselves (as they had servants to do that for them), but adapt after a few weeks. At one point, they sight a navy ship and hoist a brightly colored flag, not realizing it signals that the ship is under quarantine. As a result, the other vessel turns away. Finally, the ship grounds itself near an inhabited tropical island and springs a leak. While Rollo dons a deep sea diving suit and submerges to patch the hole, the natives canoe out and take Betsy captive. When Rollo emerges from the ocean, the natives are scared off, enabling him to rescue Betsy and take her back to the ship. The natives return and try to board the ship. After a fierce struggle, Rollo and Betsy try to escape in a small dinghy. It starts to sink, and the natives swiftly overtake them in their canoes. Just when all seems lost, a navy submarine surfaces right underneath them and they are saved.

Clugston as Spy * Noble Johnson as Cannibal Chief Production After the disappointing reception of Sherlock Jr., Keaton and his production team's morale was low and they were looking for a project that would be both exciting and successful. While Keaton's Art Director Fred Gabourie was scouting shipyards in San Francisco for another project, The Sea Hawk, he was shown the former USAT Buford, a 5,000 ton, 500 foot ship that was being sold for scrap metal.Meade, Marion. Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase. New York, NY: Da Capo Press. 1997. . p. 148. The actual vessel was a combination passenger/cargo liner that had served as an Army transport during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I. Prior to The Navigator, the Bufords most controversial service had occurred in 1919‚Äì20, during the First Red Scare, when it was used as the \\"Soviet Ark\\" to deport 249 \\"undesirables\\" from the United States to revolutionary Russia, among them the noted anarchist Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman.Los Angeles Times, \\"Deep Sea Comedy,\\" May 11, 1924, pg. 23 Gabourie was told that a film production could do anything with the ship, including set it on fire or sink it. Gabourie rushed back to Los Angeles to tell Keaton about the ship. Keaton immediately began planning a film centered around the Buford and had producer Joseph Schenck chart the boat for $25,000 with a crew and sail it to Los Angeles. Keaton renamed the ship Navigator and his crew began remodeling the interior, installing film lights and painting it. Of the 60 person film crew about half were real sailors hired to handle the ship. Filming on board the Navigator took 10 weeks, mostly off Catalina Island. Keaton initially hired Donald Crisp to direct the dramatic scenes, leaving himself free to concentrate on the comedic ones. However, Crisp was uninterested in drama and \\"turned gagman overnight on me!\\" according to Keaton. Keaton found Crisp difficult to collaborate withMeade. p. 149. and informed Crisp that the shooting was over just as an excuse to get rid of him. Keaton then resumed filming without Crisp. After completing production on board the Navigator, Keaton began shooting the underwater scenes in the Riverside municipal pool. They had to extend the pool's concrete walls to 20 feet and submerged a 12-foot prop propeller. However the extra weight in the pool caused the bottom to cave in and Keaton had to move production to Lake Tahoe to finish the underwater scenes. To cope with the cold temperature of the lake, Keaton and his cameraman drank bourbon. It took Keaton several weeks to complete what would become a few minutes of underwater footage in the finished film. The delays caused the film to go over budget, which Keaton and Schenck fought over.Meade. 1997. p. 150. Critical reception The film premiered on Columbus day 1924 at the Capitol theater in New York, at that time the largest movie theater in the world. At the Capitol The Navigator was a huge hit and ran for a rare second week at the theater. Overall The Navigator was Keaton's biggest hit, grossing $680,406 on a $385,000 budget. Keaton said that it was his best film.Meade. 1997.p. 151. When the film was released, Variety said, \\"Buster Keaton's comedy is spotty. That is to say it's both commonplace and novel, with the latter sufficient to make the picture a laugh getter...\\" Variety also noted the novelty of Keaton's deep-sea diving costume and settings and praised \\"an abundance of funny business\\" in some of the film's underwater scenes.Variety. Film review extract, 1924. Last accessed: July 16, 2009. More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz wrote that the film \\"proved to be Keaton's biggest commercial success. Its theme of civilized man versus the machine (seen as making life difficult for modern man because we have become so dependent on it and it's not always reliable), was never used more effectively in cinema.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

History The reservoir and dam were constructed between 1911 and 1920 by the Corporation of Birkenhead to prove a high quality source of drinking water for the Wirral and parts of Liverpool. The reservoir and dam were built with the authority of an Act of Parliament and although the scheme involved flooding a long valley in central North Wales, the scheme encountered no opposition from local people. An original filter works building enclosing sixteen batteries of six Bell's Patent Filters is now vacant with a modern treatment plant some 100 metres distant. The treatment plant and piped aqueduct continue to supply Birkenhead with water and, despite the proximity of this reservoir to the other River Dee reservoirs, Llyn Celyn, Llyn Brenig and Llyn Tegid, it is not part of the Dee Regulation Scheme and its abstraction is not limited in the same ways as the other sources. It is the only reservoir in the Dee system providing a direct piped supply of water. Location The bulk of the reservoir lies in Cerrigydrudion community, while the northern arm forms the boundary between Pentrefoelas, to the west, and Llansannan and Nantglyn, to the north and east. It is held back by the high Alwen Dam, which impounds the Afon Alwen, and is downstream from Llyn Alwen, a natural lake at the head of the catchment. It was built between 1909 and 1921, originally to supply water to the town of Birkenhead, near Liverpool in England. Today it is part of the River Dee regulation system and is operated by Welsh Water. The dam is a gravity-arch masonry dam. The \\"first stone\\" of the dam records that the engineers were Sir Alex. Binnie, Son and [George] Deacon and the contractors were Sir Robert McAlpine. A large water treatment facility was built below the dam, and a cast iron underground aqueduct laid to Birkenhead. The original water treatment buildings are still standing, but the equipment inside has long gone, replaced by modern plant in a new building. The operators, Welsh Water have a scheme to teach children about the importance of water, linked to the National Curriculum Key Stage 2 and offer an on-site classroom and guided tours of the water treatment works to schools. The nearby Outdoor Education Centre at Pentre-Llyn-Cymmer accommodates children during school trips. The reservoir is very close to Llyn Brenig. It is at the end of a valley, and has no through routes around it for vehicles. However the reservoir has an extensive network of trails (public footpaths as well as forest roads suitable for horse riding, mountain biking and walking). Footpaths around the reservoir were upgraded in 2005 and 2006, providing better access to the general public and allowing greater exploration of the North and South Alwen forests. Fishing is permitted through permit (which can be purchased from the visitors centre at the nearby Llyn Brenig visitors centre).  Access  Access is via the B4501, turning north off the A5 at Cerrig-y-drudion.

He is the Glenn T. Seaborg Professor Emeritus, University of California, Berkeley, Chancellor‚Äôs Professor Emeritus and Professor of the Graduate School, University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3) and the Department of Bioengineering. He was born in 1945, grew up in Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and studied undergraduate mathematics and chemistry in Israel at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Coming to the United States in 1968, Pines obtained his Ph.D. in chemical physics at M.I.T. in 1972 and joined the UC Berkeley faculty later that year.  Research  Pines is a pioneer in the development and applications of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of non-liquid samples. In his early work, he demonstrated time-reversal of dipole-dipole couplings in many-body spin systems, and introduced high sensitivity, cross polarization NMR of dilute spins such as carbon-13 in solids (Proton Enhanced Nuclear Induction Spectroscopy), thereby helping to launch the era of modern solid-state NMR in chemistry. He also developed the areas of multiple-quantum spectroscopy, adiabatic sech/tanh inversion pulses, zero-field NMR, double rotation and dynamic-angle spinning, iterative maps for pulse sequences and quantum control, and the quantum geometric phase. His combination of optical pumping and cross-polarization made it possible to observe enhanced NMR of surfaces and the selective \\"lighting up\\" of solution NMR and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by means of laser-polarized xenon. His current program is composed of two complementary components. The first is the establishment of new concepts and techniques in NMR and MRI, in order to extend their applicability and enhance their capability to investigate molecular structure, organization and function from materials to organisms. Examples of methodologies emanating from these efforts include: novel polarization and detection methods, ex-situ and mobile NMR and MRI, laser-polarized NMR and MRI, functionalized NMR biosensors and molecular imaging, ultralow and zero- field SQUID NMR and MRI, remote detection of NMR and MRI amplified by means of laser magnetometers, and miniaturization including fluid flow through porous materials and \\"microfluidic chemistry and NMR/MRI on a chip\\". The second component of his research program involves the application of such novel methods to problems in chemistry, materials science, and biomedicine.  Awards  Among his many prestigious awards and honors, Pines has received the Langmuir Medal of the American Chemical Society, the Faraday Medal of the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Wolf Prize for Chemistry (together with Richard R. Ernst) in 1991. He was awarded the F.A. Cotton Medal for Excellence in Chemical Research of the American Chemical Society in 1999. In 2005, an Ampere Symposium was held in honor of Pines' 60th birthday in Chamonix, France, and in 2008, he was awarded the Russell Varian Prize at the European Magnetic Resonance Conference. (Previous Varian Prizes winners: Jean Jeener, Erwin Hahn, Nicolaas Bloembergen, John. S. Waugh, and Alfred G. Redfield.) Pines has also been recognized by numerous teaching honors, including the University of California's Distinguished Teaching Award. He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (London); he is Doctor Honoris Causa at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Universite Paul Cezanne, University of Paris and the University of Rome, and past President of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance.

Office Structure and Legal Remit The law in Northern Ireland does not permit the police to investigate complaints made by members of the public about the conduct of police officers. These must be referred instead to the Police Ombudsman‚Äôs Office for independent investigation.Part VII Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. The Office has a complement of around 150, about two thirds of whom are employed within the Office‚Äôs investigative teams. There are two main strands to the investigative work of the Office ‚Äì current and historical. Its current work involves dealing with complaints about the conduct of police officers during incidents which have occurred in the previous 12 months. Legislation also permits the Police Ombudsman's Office to investigate matters involving police officers which he considers to be grave or exceptional, no matter when they took place.RUC (Complaints etc) Regulations 2001 These are cases in which police officers may have been responsible for deaths or serious criminality. Complaints being dealt with by the Office include those alleging police involvement in murder, attempted murder, as well as conspiracy and incitement to murder.Investigating the Past Most of these historical cases relate to incidents during the conflict in Northern Ireland between 1968 and 1998 (commonly referred to as ‚ÄúThe Troubles‚Äù).

Mikhail Lavrov was born on 13 September 1799 in the city of Arkhangelsk. He graduated from Cadets Corps in Saint Petersburg and served at the Baltic Fleet. He participated in the voyage of the cargo ship Mezen from Kronstadt to Arkhangelsk and back in 1819‚Äì1820. In 1821‚Äì1824, in the rank of senior officer, he participated in the expedition of Fyodor Litke on board of the brig Novaya Zemlya, making description of coast line of Murmansk and Novaya Zemlya archipelago. In 1825‚Äì1827, he made a round-the-world voyage on board sloop Krotkiy with Admiral Ferdinand Wrangel, visiting Kamchatka and Russian America. In 1831‚Äì1834, Lavrov served in the rank of lieutenant commander in the Mediterranean and Adriatic, participated in a battle against pirate ships, sinking four of them, and was therefore promoted to the rank of commander. In 1833, he was awarded with an Order of St. George of the 4th degree for immaculate service in the officer rank in 18 six-month campaigns. In 1846, during exercises in the Baltic Sea on board battleship Gangut, Captain Lavrov refused to obey an admiral's order and was to reduced to the rank of sailor by Tsar Nicholas I. In 1850 he was given back his captain's rank and resigned. Alexander II of Russia gave Mikhail Lavrov the opportunity to serve again in the Russian Navy in 1855, and he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral for the feat of arms. In 1857‚Äì1864, Mikhail Lavrov was governor of the city of Taganrog, where he initiated opening the steamboat line Taganrog-Constantinople. In 1872, Lavrov was promoted to the admiral's rank and served at the reserve fleet. A cape to the south of Melkiy Bay in the Arctic, an island the Vladivostok Bay and another island off the NE shores of Bolshevik Island in Severnaya Zemlya were named after Admiral Lavrov.

This, combined with the distinctive summit rocks which provide the alternative name 'The Lion and the Lamb', makes it one of the most recognised hills in the District. Alfred Wainwright wrote of Helm Crag that \\"The virtues of Helm Crag have not been lauded enough. It gives an exhilarating little climb, a brief essay in real mountaineering, and, in a region where all is beautiful, it makes a notable contribution to the natural charms and attractions of Grasmere.\\"A. Wainwright, A Pictorial Guide to the Lake Fells, Book 3, The Central Fells, (London: Frances Lincoln, 2003), Helm Crag p.2 Topography The eastern face of Helm Crag A rocky ridge curves east and then south east from Calf Crag, passing over Gibson Knott and the depression of Bracken Hause, before ending at Helm Crag where it falls steeply on all sides. To the north and east of the ridge is the Greenburn valley, which joins the Rothay at Helm Side. To the west and south is Easedale Beck, which is also a feeder of the Rothay, the watersmeet being just north of Grasmere village. Helm Crag is generally rough, with particular features being High and Low Raven Crags on the eastern side and White Crag on the southern extremity. Geology The geology of the fell is complex, but the summit is in an area of outcropping andesite sill.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1999) Summit The Summit The \\"Old Woman playing the Organ\\" rocks. The summit is unusual, having two short parallel ridges running north west to south east with a hollow in between, the western ridge being the higher. Some distance below the eastern ridge the scene is repeated as, still keeping parallel, a third ridge, ditch and parapet are crossed before the crags are reached. The whole complex initially appears man-made, but is entirely natural. The summit commands views of the Langdale Pikes, Coniston Fells and Eastern Fells.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): The Lion and the Lamb At either end of the highest ridge are the rock outcrops that ensure Helm Crag's fame. Only one can be seen from any point in the surrounding valleys, and they have a variety of names depending upon the profile seen from the particular vantage point. The northwestern outcrop is the true summit of the fell, a tricky little scramble being needed to stand on the top. It is variously called \\"The old lady playing the organ\\" when seen from Mill Gill, \\"The howitzer\\" from the summit of Dunmail Raise and \\"The lion and the lamb\\" or \\"The lion couchant\\" from a point in between. The southern outcrop is prominent from Grasmere and this is the traditional \\"Lion and the lamb\\". Ascents Helm Crag is normally ascended from Grasmere, though can also be approached from either valley via Bracken Hause, or along the ridge from Gibson Knott.

As such, algebraic manifolds are a generalisation of the concept of smooth curves and surfaces defined by polynomials. An example is the sphere, which can be defined as the zero set of the polynomial and hence is an algebraic variety. For an algebraic manifold, the ground field will be the real numbers or complex numbers; in the case of the real numbers, the manifold of real points is sometimes called a Nash manifold. Every sufficiently small local patch of an algebraic manifold is isomorphic to km where k is the ground field. Equivalently the variety is smooth (free from singular points).

It develops a theory of political science and economics of concentrated benefits versus diffuse costs. Its central argument is that concentrated minor interests will be overrepresented and diffuse majority interests trumped, due to a free-rider problem that is stronger when a group becomes larger. Overview The book challenged accepted wisdom in Olson‚Äôs day that: # if everyone in a group (of any size) has interests in common, then they will act collectively to achieve them; and # in a democracy, the greatest concern is that the majority will tyrannize and exploit the minority. The book argues instead that individuals in any group attempting collective action will have incentives to \\"free ride\\" on the efforts of others if the group is working to provide public goods. Individuals will not \\"free ride\\" in groups that provide benefits only to active participants. Pure public goods are goods that are non-excludable (i.e. one person cannot reasonably prevent another from consuming the good) and non- rivalrous (one person‚Äôs consumption of the good does not affect another‚Äôs, nor vice versa). Hence, without selective incentives to motivate participation, collective action is unlikely to occur even when large groups of people with common interests exist. The book noted that large groups will face relatively high costs when attempting to organize for collective action while small groups will face relatively low costs, and individuals in large groups will gain less per capita of successful collective action. Hence, in the absence of selective incentives, the incentive for group action diminishes as group size increases, so that large groups are less able to act in their common interest than small ones. The book concludes that, not only is collective action by large groups difficult to achieve even when they have interests in common, but situations could occur where the minority (bound together by concentrated selective incentives) can dominate the majority. Critique Olson's original logic of collective action has received several critiques, based either on a different interpretation of the observations on minority interest representation, or on a disagreement on the degree of concentrated interest representation. Information asymmetry Susanne Lohmann agrees with puzzling observations made by Olson, which she classifies as economic and political puzzles. Economic puzzles are cases of general welfare loss in favour of a minority benefit which is smaller in sum. An example she gives is a quota on sugar imports in the United States, which generates 2261 jobs at the expense of a general welfare reduction of $1,162 million (Hufbauer and Elliot, 1994). Then the implicit price for a job in the sugar industry is above $500,000, allowing for significant room for Pareto improvement. Political puzzles are cases where minority trumps majority. An example she gives is the rural bias in urbanized countries, such as the Common Agricultural Policy in the European Union. Lohmann claims that Olson's free- rider problem is insufficient to explain these puzzles. Instead, she argues they are due to uncertainty (information asymmetry among actors) when special interest groups evaluate how political actors promote their interests. She states that everyone can be considered a special interest. Because everyone is (relatively) sure how well their interests are represented, they give more weight to their interest representation when evaluating political actors than to the general benefit. Lohmann argues that it could be politically viable to focus on separate narrow interests at the expense of general benefits. Legitimacy Gunnar Trumbull rejects the observation by Olson and Lohmann that concentrated interests dominate public policy. He points out that historically, diffuse interests nearly always found ways to be represented in public policy, such as the interests of retirees, patients or consumers. Trumbull explains this with the role of legitimacy of interest groups that promote policies. He argues that diffuse interests have a legitimacy premium when they manage to mobilize, while concentrated interests are viewed with suspicion. He describes the concept of legitimacy coalitions, which are coalitions between state policymakers, social activists or industry to promote certain policy. By having to form a coalition, the interests are more broadly represented. An example of such a coalition is the post-war neo-corporatist system.  Critical Mass  Marwell and Oliver Marwell, Gerald, and Pamela Oliver. The Critical Mass in Collective Action: A Micro-Social Theory. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993. use mathematical and computational models to show that a number of the assumptions made by Olson are unrealistic, and if they are relaxed, the behavior of a system of rational agents changes dramatically. One assumption is that the \\"production function\\" of goods is linear. If this function instead accelerates, then a critical mass of early contributors can encourage a large number of others to contribute. Another assumption is that the cost of the good is a function of the size of the group that would benefit from it. For many public goods, this is not true, and Marwell and Oliver show that when the interest group is larger, there is a larger chance that it will include someone for whom it is rational to provide the good, either in part or in full.

Early life and education Heaton-Armstrong was born at Salisbury House, Edmonton, the son of the Austrian-born politician and businessman William Heaton- Armstrong and his wife, Baroness Bertha Adalberta Maximiliana Zois-Edelstein, who came from an ennobled Habsburg family. She was the granddaughter of Karl von Zois, whose brother was Sigmund Zois. Heaton-Armstrong was educated at Eton College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Military service During the First World War, Heaton-Armstrong was commissioned into the Cavalry Branch of the Reserve of Officers of the British Indian Army as a second lieutenant, and was later promoted to lieutenant. His first heraldic appointment at the College came on 6 April 1922, when he was made Rouge Dragon Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary. On 14 October 1926, Heaton-Armstrong was promoted to the position of Chester Herald of Arms in Ordinary. This office was made vacant by the promotion of Arthur Cochrane to the office of Norroy King of Arms. He was made a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (fourth class) (MVO) in 1937. While holding this post, Heaton-Armstrong took a leave from the College of Arms to fight in World War II. During this conflict, he rose to the rank of squadron leader in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch of the Royal Air Force. He relinquished his commission in 1944, and returned to the College of Arms, and was knighted in the Coronation Honours of 1953. Service as Clarenceux King of Arms In 1956, with the death of Archibald George Blomefield Russel, Heaton-Armstrong was promoted to the office of Clarenceux King of Arms. As such, he was responsible for the granting of arms in his jurisdiction south of the River Trent. While Chester Herald, Heaton-Armstrong was appointed to the honorary post of Inspector of Royal Air Force Badges, which post he held for the rest of his life.

History The Otter Light Reconnaissance Car (LRC) was developed by General Motors Canada to meet the demand for this type of armoured car. The design followed the layout of the British Humber Mark III LRC. Design The Otter was based on the Chevrolet C15 Canadian Military Pattern truck chassis and used many standard GM components. It took a crew of three - driver and commander seated in the vehicle front, while the gunner occupied the turret position at the rear. A Wireless Set No. 19 was mounted in the rear with A and B set aerials extending from the rear of the fighting compartment on mounting arms. The primary armament consisted of a hull-mounted Boys anti-tank rifle and a Bren light machine gun in a small open-topped turret. A smoke discharger is mounted alongside the mounting for the Boys anti-tank rifle. Although it used a more powerful engine than the Humber, it was larger and heavier (by a ton); overall performance was less than that of the Humber, but still acceptable. Production Between 1942 and 1945, 1761 units were produced in Oshawa, Ontario, though fewer than 1,000 were delivered overseas.canadiansoldiers.com article Usage The Otter served with Canadian units in the Italian Campaign and Northwest European operations. It was also employed by the South African Army and the British RAF Regiment. Some RAF regiment vehicles used aircraft armament such as 20mm cannon and 0.303 Browning machine guns.

Determining this rate is not always easy and can be the subject of discrepancies in the true net benefit to certain projects, plans and policies. The discount rate is considered as a critical element in cost-benefit analysis when the costs and the benefits differ in their distribution over time, this usually occurs when the project that is being studied is over a long period of time.  Use in cost benefit analysis  It may be used in estimating the value of creating a highway system, schools, or enforcing environmental protection, for example. All of these things require a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis where policy makers measure the social marginal cost and the social marginal benefit for each project. Almost all new policies will not even be considered until after a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis has been completed. The social discount rate can appear in both calculations either as future costs such as maintenance or as future benefits such as reduced pollution emissions. Calculating the true social marginal cost can be a lot easier than measuring the social marginal benefit. Because of the uncertainty involved with calculating benefits, problems may arise e.g., should a dollar amount be put on time based on average wages, contingent valuations or revealed preferences? One of the big problems today is putting a value on a life. While some might say that a life is priceless, economists usually state the value to be somewhere between three and ten million dollars. Another problem is that because the current generation will often be paying for most of the costs while future generations will be reaping most of the benefit, whether current and future benefits ought to be weighed differently. The proper discount rate should represent the opportunity cost of what else the firm could accomplish with those same funds.Gruber, Jonathan (2007). \\"Chapter 8: Cost‚ÄìBenefit Analysis\\" Public Finance and Public Policy, pp. 201‚Äì223 If that means that the money could be instead used to invest in the private sector that would yield 5% and that is the next best alternative for using that money then 5% would be the social discount rate The US government uses a variety of discount rates but something around 7% is what the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recommends for a pretax rate of return on private investments. In the United Kingdom, HM Treasury fixes the social discount rate for the public sector at 3.5%.  Calculation  The SDR is directly analogous to concepts found in corporate finance such as the hurdle rate or the project appropriate discount rate; so the mathematics are identical. The benefit or cost per dollar can be calculated by :\\\\ (1/(1+r)^t) where r equals the SDR and t equals time. For benefits or costs that have no end and discount starting tomorrow it is just :\\\\ (1/r) where discounting starts at t=0 it is :\\\\ (1+1/r) A higher SDR makes it less likely a social project will be funded. A higher SDR implies greater risks to the assumption that the benefits of the project will be reaped. A small increase in the social discount rate can matter enormously for benefits far into the future so it is very important to be as accurate as possible when choosing which rate to use. There is a strong case for factoring in the equity issue when discounting benefits and costs of intergenerational projects such as those designed to combat climate change and environmental degradation. The social discount rate is a reflection of a society's relative valuation on today's well-being versus well-being in the future. The appropriate selection of a social discount rate is crucial for cost-benefit analysis, and has important implications for resource allocations. There is wide diversity in social discount rates, with developed nations typically applying a lower rate (3‚Äì7%) than developing nations (8‚Äì15%). The subject of a social discount rate, always a source of fierce debate between economists, has become highly controversial since the publication of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change. The publication exploded on the global warming scene in 2006 with its dire warning that global gross domestic product (GDP) was at future risk of a 20% reduction if there was a failure to invest 1% of world GDP now to reduce global warming. The Review did not use a single discount rate, but applied a stochastic approach whereby the discount rate varied with the expected outcomes, reflecting the interaction between growth and the elasticity of marginal utility, in line with Frank Ramsey's growth model. However, critics questioned the findings on the basis that they were partly arrived at using an extremely low pure time preference rate of 0.1% in economic modeling. There is no consensus among economists and, according to the survey, no \\"one-size-fits- all\\" solution to the choice of social discount rate, owing to national variations. A regular reassessment and readjustment of the social discount rate used by each country is therefore required.  Differences between private and social  There are a number of qualitative differences between social and corporate discount rates and evaluation of projects associated with them. The governance of social project funding is different naturally, because estimating the benefits of social projects requires making ethically subtle choices about the benefits to others. For example, if it was presumed that a meteor will wipe out all life in a few years the SDR after the event is infinitely high. Alternately if we presume that the population will have many new and wonderful choices capturing benefits (i.e. they will be more wealthy) in the future that too raises the SDR of creating any given benefit. For example, choices about the SDR of environmental protection projects, such as funding the reduction of global warming, place a greater valuation on future generations.  Contributors to social discount rate  As with private discount rates, social discount rates can attempt to incorporate several factors (however, some factors may overlap or be inapplicable in a given analysis). One factor is a common expectation of increased wealth in the future, in which case a dollar received now, in the midst of relative poverty, has more utility than a dollar received later, in the midst of relative wealth. (This factor may not apply to non-monetary rewards, for example, measuring lives saved now versus lives saved later.) Similarly, economists refer to a \\"time value of money\\": a dollar received now might grant the recipient the option to either used the dollar now or to invest it (gaining interest) and using it next year, whereas a dollar received next year can only be used next year (and without the intervening interest). A third factor is that a proposed project may fail or become moot due to changing circumstances; if a fixed annual percentage change of such failure can be approximated, that risk can be rolled into the total discount rate. A fourth factor is pragmatics: people seem to discount the future anyway, so the theory might as well incorporate a uniform compromise to express the desired trade-off between present and future welfare.  \\"Pure time preference\\" debates  The pragmatic factor usually results in a \\"pure time preference\\" factor in the social discount rate, that a pleasurable experience at a certain date is intrinsically more valuable than the exact same experience at a later date, and that the life of a person born sooner has more intrinsic value than the life of a person born later. According to philosopher Toby Ord, while this is common practice in the economics community, most philosophers consider a \\"pure time preference\\" to lack intrinsic moral justification. Frank Ramsey, himself, labeled it \\"ethically indefensible\\". Ord also argues that, given the long and unfortunate human history of discounting the welfare of outgroups, the burden should be on those proposing a pure time preference to establish its necessity. Intuitively, it seems odd that the welfare of an 80-year-old born in 1970 is intrinsically superior to the welfare of an 80-year-old born in 1980; in the context of social (rather than private) discount rates, when asked for their preferences over the welfare of others, most peoples' apparent \\"pure time preferences\\" becomes smaller or even disappears. Philosopher Derek Parfit states \\"No one suggests that... we should adopt a Spatial Discount Rate. No one thinks that we would be morally justified if we cared less about the long-range effects of our acts, at some rate n percent per yard. The Temporal Discount Rate is, I believe, as little justified.\\"Nick Bostrom. \\"Infinite ethics.\\" Analysis and Metaphysics 10 (2011): 9-59. When considering longer time periods, a fixed \\"pure time preference\\" discount rate becomes extremely counterintuitive; a 1% rate implies that Tutankhamun should ethically value a single day of his life over the sum total entire lives of everyone living today. Over long periods, peoples' stated preferences become extremely hyperbolic. Critics worry that valuing the individual welfare of future generations can, if taken to an extreme, lead to a problematic 'Pascal's mugging' conclusion that current welfare has relatively negligible value.  In global climate change  This topic has recently been very controversial and highly debated. Since there is such a strong probability that the world will suffer significantly in the future due to global change in temperature, finding the correct social discount rate for the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions and other harmful greenhouse gases is very important. > \\"The choice of an appropriate social time discount rate has long been > debated. Some very intelligent people have argued that giving future > generations less weight than the current generation is 'ethically > indefensible.' Other equally intelligent people have argued that weighting > generations equally leads to paradoxical and even nonsensical > results.\\"Recalculating the Costs of Global Climate Change ‚Äì New York Times Ramsey's social discount rate is calculated as follows: :r=d+n*g, where d is time preference, n is the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption and g is the growth rate. The range in the social discount rate for a cost-benefit analysis in this issue range from zero to over 3%. Some argue that the only reason for discriminating against future generations is that these generations might cease to exist in the future. Thus the rate of time preference should equal zero since the probability for such a catastrophic event is so low (assumed to be 0.1% per year). This infers that there is equal weight given to all generations. However, to the extent that future generations are likely to be richer than those in the present, a positive discount rate should be applied reflecting the diminishing marginal utility of consumption. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change is one such report that argues for zero discrimination of future generations, but applied a range of positive discount rates to its assessment based on the range of consumption projections predicted by climate models at the time. There is an important distinction here between discounting, which is partly a function of expected future consumption paths, and pure time preference, which the rate of discrimination through time. A common misconception is that the Stern Review applied a zero discount rate. In fact, the Stern review's stochastic projections applied many discount rates reflecting a range of consumption projections, all of them positive, even while it took the rate of time preference to be close to zero. This confusion is prevalent. William D. Nordhaus of Yale > \\"examines a model of climate change that is similar to the one used in the > Stern Review but with a 3 percent social discount rate that slowly declines > to 1 percent in 300 years rather than the 0.1 percent discount rate used in > the Stern Review.

W. Griffith and starring Lillian Gish. It is one of four film adaptations of the melodramatic 19th century play Way Down East by Lottie Blair Parker. There were two earlier silent versions and one sound version in 1935 starring Henry Fonda.. Griffith's version is particularly remembered for its climax in which Lillian Gish's character is rescued from doom on an icy river. Plot Anna (Lillian Gish) is a poor country girl whom handsome man- about-town Lennox (Lowell Sherman) tricks into a fake wedding. When she becomes pregnant, he leaves her. She has the baby, named Trust Lennox, on her own. When the baby dies she wanders until she gets a job with Squire Bartlett (Burr McIntosh). David (Richard Barthelmess), Squire Bartlett's son, falls for her, but she rejects him due to her past. Lennox then shows up lusting for another local girl, Kate. Seeing Anna, he tries to get her to leave, but she refuses to go, although she promises to say nothing about his past. Finally, Squire Bartlett learns of Anna's past from Martha, the town gossip. In his anger, he tosses Anna out into a snow storm. Before she goes, she names the respected Lennox as her despoiler and the father of her dead baby. She becomes lost in the raging storm while David leads a search party. In the climax, the unconscious Anna floats on an ice floe down a river towards a waterfall, until rescued at the last moment by David, who marries her in the final scene. Subplots relate the romances and eventual marriages of some of the picaresque characters inhabiting the village. Cast Production Billy Bitzer and D. W. Griffith on location Lillian Gish in the famous ice floe scene D. W. Griffith bought the film rights to the story, originally a stage play by Lottie Blair Parker that was elaborated by Joseph R. Grismer. Grismer's wife, the Welsh actress Phoebe Davies, became identified with the play beginning in 1897 and starred in over 4,000 performances of it by 1909, making it one of the most popular plays in the United States. Davies died in 1912, having toured the play for well over ten years. The play, an old-fashioned story that espoused nineteenth-century American and Victorian ideals, was considered outdated by the time of its cinematic production in 1920. Although it was Griffith's most expensive film to date, it was also one of his most commercially successful. Way Down East is the fourth-highest grossing silent film in cinema history, taking in more than $4.5 million at the box office in 1920.Dirks, Tim. The Greatest Films, film review, 1996-2008. Last accessed: February 24, 2008. Some sources, quoting newspaper ads of the time, say a sequence was filmed in an early color process, possibly Technicolor or Prizmacolor.Way Down East at SilentEra.comeMoviePoster.com Clarine Seymour, who had appeared in four previous Griffith films, was hired to play Kate, the squire's niece. However, when Seymour died after surgery, her role was given to Mary Hay, and Seymour's footage was reshot. The famous ice-floe sequence was filmed in White River Junction, Vermont. An actual waterfall was used, though it was only a few feet high; the long shot where a large drop is shown was filmed at Niagara Falls. The ice needed to be sawed or dynamited before filming could be done. During filming, a small fire had to be kept burning beneath the camera to keep the oil from freezing. At one point, Griffith was frostbitten on one side of his face. No stunt doubles were used at the time, so Gish and Barthelmess performed the stunts themselves. Gish's hair froze, and she lost feeling in her hand from the cold. It was her idea to put her hand and hair in the water, an image which would become iconic. Her right hand would be somewhat impaired for the remainder of her life. The shot where the ice floes are filmed going over the waterfall was filmed out of season, so those ice floes are actually wooden. Cinematographically, the ice floe scene is an early example of parallel action. Censorship Similar to other Griffith productions, Way Down East was subjected to censorship by some American state film censor boards. For example, the Pennsylvania film board required over 60 cuts in the film, removing the mock marriage and honeymoon between Lennox and Anna as well as any hints of her pregnancy, effectively destroying the film's integral conflict. The resulting film may have surprised viewers in that state when a child suddenly appears shortly before its death. Other cuts removed scenes where society women smoke cigarettes and an intertitle with the euphemism \\"wild oats.\\" Reception Richard Barthelmess and Gish in the film Box office The film earned $1 million in profit. Critical When the film was screened in 1994 in Washington, D.C., film critic Mark Adamo reviewed the film and wrote, \\"What's astounding about the film is not that the rickety conventions of 1890s stage melodrama dog its every frame. (Even the film's seeming pioneering of feminism is hoary: the Leviticus-style titles would have us believe that Lillian Gish's tremulous ingenue fallen prey to a heavily mascaraed rou√© is 'the story of Woman.') What's amazing is that so much of Gish's tough, funny, intuitive performance, particularly in the film's middle section as she bears her illegitimate child, transcends time, place and technology. Equally amazing is Griffith's mighty striving, with his arty location shots, quirky close-ups and riskily staged set pieces, to forge a new and expressly cinematic style.\\" Critic Paul Brenner wrote \\"Many of Griffith's features suffer from sententious moralizing, a sense of God speaking to the masses, and outright racism. But Way Down East highlights the greatness of Griffith without having to sit through the Sermon on the Mount or the Ride of The Klan. In Way Down East, Griffith's psychotic nuttiness, for once, didn‚Äôt get in the way of a good film.\\" References External links  * Way Down East at SilentEra.com * Way Down East at The Greatest Films by Tim Dirks  Category:1920 films Category:1920 romantic drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:English-language films Category:American films based on plays Category:Films set in country houses Category:United Artists films Category:Films directed by D.

Kongsfjorden was originally named Deer Sound by Jonas Poole (1610), and was known as such by the English whalers until at least 1658. Giles and Rep (c. 1710) were the first to name it Koninks Bay. William Scoresby (1820) repeats this error by naming it Kings Bay, while he moves Deer Sound to a bay in the northeast of the fjord. Modern cartographers have simply repeated this error.

Ogg Squish was also an attempt from the Xiphophorus company to create a royalty-free lossless audio compression codec. History The Ogg project began with a simple audio compression package as part of a larger project in 1993. The original name of the software was Squish, but due to an existing trademark it was later renamed to OggSquish. This name was later used for the whole Ogg project. In 1997, the Xiphophorus OggSquish was described as \\"an attempt both to create a flexible compressed audio format for modern audio applications as well as to provide the first audio format that is common on any and every modern computer platform\\". In 1998, after Fraunhofer Society Integrated Circuits Institute intended to sue MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 development projects because of license issues, the Xiphophorus company's focus was moved to a royalty-free lossy audio compression codec, named OggSquish Vorbis, or only \\"Ogg Vorbis\\" or \\"Vorbis\\". In 2000, the OggSquish was referred to as \\"a group of several related multimedia and signal processing projects\\". In 2000, two projects were in active development for planned release: Ogg Vorbis format and libvorbis - the reference implementation of Vorbis. Research also included work on future video and lossless audio coding. In 2001, OggSquish was renamed to \\"Ogg\\" and it was described as \\"the umbrella for a group of several related multimedia and signal processing projects\\". Ogg has come to stand for the container file format, as part of the larger Xiph.org multimedia project. Squish became just the name of one of the Ogg codecs. In 2000 and 2001 there was some information from Xiphophorus company's developers about plans for a continuation of Ogg Squish as a lossless audio compression.

Thompson describing his experiences in Hawaii in 1980. Originally published in 1983, the book was only in print for a short while. In 2005 it was re-released as a limited edition. Only 1000 copies were produced, each one being signed by the author and artist Ralph Steadman.The book is now available as a smaller hardcover edition.  Plot  Hunter S. Thompson receives a letter from the editor of Running magazine, asking him to cover the 1980 Honolulu Marathon, which the editor says should be \\"a good chance for a vacation\\". Hunter asks the illustrator Ralph Steadman to accompany him. On the flight over, he meets a man named Ackerman, who seems to have connections to the drug trade in Hawaii. Hunter covers the marathon with his characteristic gonzo style, weaving his own experiences into the coverage of the story. After the marathon, Hunter, Ralph and Ralph's family move to a rented beach side \\"compound\\" on Hawaii's Kona coast. The weather is miserable and they are trapped indoors, besieged by huge waves. Ralph and his family, upset about the terrible conditions of their vacation, return to England. Later, Hunter reunites with Ackerman to go fishing. Hunter eventually catches a huge Marlin, which he beats to death with a Samoan war club. The fishing boat returns to the dock, with Hunter screaming triumphantly, \\"I am Lono!\\", referring to the ancient Hawaiian god. After this, Hunter ends his story in the City of Refuge, hiding from those he upset with his antics at the docks. The story frequently breaks away to excerpts from The Last Voyage of Captain James Cook by Richard Hough, which tells the story of the man the native Hawaiians thought was the reincarnation of Lono and was eventually killed by them when he overstayed his welcome on the island of Hawaii.

The term is in contrast to the name of the official script of the Qin dynasty, which is often called Small or Lesser Seal Script (Â∞èÁØÜ Xi«éozhu√†n, also termed simply seal script). However, due to the lack of precision in the term, scholars often avoid it and instead refer more specifically to the provenance of particular examples of writing. In the Han dynasty (202 BCE ‚Äì 220 CE), when clerical script became the popular form of writing and (small) seal script was relegated to more formal usage such as on signet seals and for the titles of stelae (inscribed stone memorial tablets which were popular at the time), the people began to refer to the earlier Qin dynasty script as 'seal' script (due to the continued use on signet seals, or name chops). At that time, there was still knowledge of even older, often more complex graphs (dating to the middle to late Zhou dynasty, and directly ancestral to the Qin forms) which differed from the Qin seal script forms, but which resembled them in their rounded, seal-script-like style (as opposed to the squared, rectilinear clerical script style).‰∏≠ÂúãÂè§‰ª£Á∞°Â∏õÂ≠óÂΩ¢„ÄÅËæ≠‰æãÊï∏ÊìöÂ∫´ As a result, two terms emerged to describe them: 'greater seal script' for the more complex, earlier forms, and 'small seal script' for the Qin dynasty forms. It is only more recently that the term 'greater seal script' has been extended to refer to Western Zhou forms or even oracle bone script, of which the Han dynasty coiners of this term were unaware. The term 'large seal script' is also sometimes traditionally identified with a group of characters from a book c. 800 BCE entitled Shizhoupian, preserved by their inclusion in the Han dynasty lexicon, the Shuowen Jiezi. Xu Shen, the author of Shuowen, included these when they differed from the structures of the Qin (small) seal script, and labelled the examples Zh√≤uw√©n (Á±ÄÊñá) or Zh√≤u graphs. This name comes from the name of the book and not the name of a script. Thus, it is not correct to refer to the c. 800 BCE Zho≈´ (Âë®) dynasty script as Zh√≤uw√©n. Similarly, the Zh√≤u graphs are merely examples of large seal script when that term is used in a broad sense.

The Marauder was intended to join the product line shortly before Leo Fender sold the company to CBS, but it never went into production. After introducing the Jazzmaster in 1958 and the Jaguar in 1962, between 1964 and 1965, Fender prototyped the Marauder. There were two \\"versions\\" made: Type I, with four pickups hidden underneath the pickguard and which are shown in the 1965 catalog, and Type II, with the pickups mounted in a more conventional fashion on the pickguard and never appeared in any catalog.  Prototypes  The original Fender Marauder prototype was a Jaguar guitar with an \\"L\\" serial number plate built in 1963, and personally owned, modified and played by Quilla \\"Porky\\" Freeman. In the late-70's, ‚ÄòPorky‚Äô sold to dealer Norm Harris and soon sold it to guitarist/historian Robb Lawrence (who has documented the Marauder story). It utilized four large, slightly offset 12-pole experimental pickups with deep armatures producing a very percussive tonality. Porky also developed a novel hidden vibrato arm channeled within this Jaguar guitar. Eventually it went into the permanent collection of a well-known Bay area musician, where it remains to this day. (May, 17th, 2012) The few 1964-65 Fender versions never officially passed the prototype stages, allegedly because the hidden pickups (Type I variation) were either too expensive for mass-production or the technology itself was too expensive to license. These original Marauder samples had four wider, high powered pickups with 16 polepieces, all submerged deep into the body and hidden under the pickguard. The whole idea of Porky's was to have total ease of playability without any large pickups protruding and still have very versatile electronics. Naming the hidden pickup idea was logically akin to a masked marauder, hence the official catalog name. The four 3-way switches gave 48 different tonal characteristics with its in and out of phase pickup positions. They were never made available to the public and the six known pre-production models were given away as promotions to shops around the Fullerton, California area.The Fender Book: A Complete History of Fender Electric Guitars by Tony Bacon, Paul Day. Prototype The Type II variation has three exposed pickups, with the bridge pickup slanted as upon a Stratocaster. It also has seven switches and four knobs. The thinking behind the model was to combine the ideas behind the Stratocaster and Jaguar guitars while adding some new features to increase versatility.  Type I Features  Porky's other personal instrument is a vibrato guitar, ice blue metallic (now aged to a Teal green metallic) with a matching headstock. It has five switches ‚Äì four pickup controls (one per pickup ‚Äì on/off/phased) plus a \\"lead/rhythm\\" Jaguar style upper-bout switch. It has two sets of volume/tone pots ‚Äì rollers on top control plate (rhythm position) and traditional pots on the lower control plate (lead position). Porky's ice blue metallic Marauder has a 1964 ‚ÄòL‚Äô neck plate and was fitted with plastic button \\"F\\" Grover tuning machines, which were not used on the Marauders in the 1965 catalog, and was delivered in a brown tolex case. All hidden 16 pole pickups were custom made for these Marauder I models. The present owner of this faded blue Marauder sample also has one spare pickup luckily found on eBay. At least five more of the original Marauder I models are known to have been produced. Fender and Bob Perine showcased two of these first Marauders, a sunburst vibrato version and a non-vibrato \\"hard-tail\\" green one, in their 1965‚Äì66 catalog as their most expensive guitars. Don Randall listed the instruments on more than one price sheet beginning in early 1965 before abandoning the project for unspecified reasons. Besides the three seen in Bob Perine's promo picture (including the rocker switch, slant fret), it is not known if any of the other sighted Marauders (another sunburst one now white and candy apple red) current whereabouts are. One possible reason they ditched the Marauder might have been a disagreement of some sort between the new CBS owners of Fender and Quilla \\"Porky\\") H. Freeman, the inventor of the Marauder and owner of the patent. Patent #3,035,472, dated May 22, 1962, covers the Marauder's under the pickguard pickups: \\"the construction is such that the electromagnetic pickups may be housed within the body of the stringed musical instrument...\\" After Fender bailed out, Porky took his patented hidden pickup design to Rickenbacker, and in 1968, Rickenbacker made one prototype of a four-hidden- pickups-beneath-the-pickguard guitar before apparently deciding against going into production, again for unspecified reasons.  Variations  Both the Fender and Rickenbacker four-hidden-pickups-beneath-the-pickguard Marauder prototypes survive to this day, but nobody has published any pictures of other original hidden-pickup Marauders and made their existence known to the guitar collecting world. Both of these prototype guitars were initially owned by Porky Freeman and their provenance from him to the current owners has been well-documented by reliable persons who are alive today. The private owners desire anonymity and are known to only a few very dedicated guitar collectors. Later guitars with the three visible pickups and/or slant frets were built on a differently shaped body, and were never officially named by Fender as Marauders or anything else. Still, some people refer to these experimental guitars as \\"Type II Marauders\\" for reasons that have never been clear. In the 1999‚Äì2001, the Fender Custom Shop (Fred Stuart) built some guitars that bore some, but not all, of the Marauder characteristics and sold them as Fender Marauder Custom Shop reissues. The reason they weren't entirely accurate representations is that nobody, according to Mr. Stuart, knew the exact specifications of those 1965 catalog Marauders, even amongst Fender old-timers and collectors. Mr. Stuart stated that all he had to work with was the catalog photo and one body template, found in the Fender shop and labeled \\"Marauder\\" in pencil. These Custom Shop \\"Marauders\\" were wired differently, had different pickups, had different body shapes and slightly different dimensions and geometry from the original Marauders shown in the 1965 Fender catalog. Around the turn of the 21st century, the Fender Custom Shop made a 12-string Marauder model. However, this guitar was radically different from the mid-1960s original, having fewer switches and a very different body shape.  New Models   Fender Modern Player Marauder (2011-2013)  Fender Modern Player Marauder In October 2011, Fender introduced a new Marauder model as part of the Modern Player entry-level series. This Marauder shares the general body shape of the 1960s original but has a simplified switching system featuring a 5-way switch, master volume and tone controls. It also sports a Triplebucker humbucking pickup and a Modern Player Jazzmaster pickup in the lead and rhythm positions. This model is also unique as the first Fender production model to be made with a Koto wood body. The guitar has a C-shaped maple neck, rosewood fretboard, vintage-style synchronized tremolo bridge, vintage-style tuners, and nickel/chrome hardware. It was available in black and Lake Placid Blue versions. A review of the humbucker mode cite a bright and punchy sound, which is said to work on heavy riffs and power chords while the triple-coil setting creates warmer tone at a slightly decreased output. As of 2014, the Fender Modern Player Marauder model has now been discontinued with multiple vendors presently listing this version as an increasingly collectable model.

Duke of Sparta (Katharevousa: , Demotic Greek: ŒîŒøœçŒ∫Œ±œÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ£œÄŒ¨œÅœÑŒ∑œÇ) was a title instituted in 1868 to designate the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Greece. Its legal status was exceptional, as the Greek constitution forbade the award or acceptance of titles of nobility for Greek citizens. Consequently, it was mostly used abroad, and only occasionally and unofficially within Greece. The birth of Crown Prince Constantine (later king as Constantine I) on 21 July/2 August 1868 was widely celebrated in Greece, especially as the heir-apparent's name resonated with the Byzantine imperial tradition and the irredentist aspirations enshrined in the \\"Megali Idea\\". As a result, on the day of the Crown Prince's baptism on 22 August/3 September, at the initiative of the Prime Minister Dimitrios Voulgaris, his father, King George I, issued a decree according to which Constantine, as well as any future heir to the Greek crown, would bear the title \\"Duke of Sparta\\".Royal Decree of 22 August/3 September 1868, published in Œ¶ŒïŒö 44/1868 However, this decree was contrary to Article 3 of the Greek constitution, which expressly prohibited the recognition of foreign titles of nobility or the conferment of such on Greek citizens, a tradition that had been established already during the Greek War of Independence, even though several of its leading figures had previously borne such titles. This led to a stormy debate in Parliament, at the instigation of Timoleon Filimon. The government of the day backed the decree on the argument that the constitutional provision did not apply to members of the Royal Family, but Filimon and others countered that the phrasing made no distinction, and that the decree thus violated the constitution. The decree was finally approved by Parliament on 17/29 September 1868, with 98 votes in favour, 2 abstentions, and 26 against. Nevertheless, use of the title \\"Duke of Sparta\\" within Greece was later quietly dropped. However, Crown Prince Constantine was known as \\"HRH The Duke of Sparta\\" on the international scene from his birth until his accession in 1913‚Äîfor 45 years. This again led to the misunderstanding of various, quite respectable publications that the title \\"Duke of Sparta\\" was synonymous with that of \\"Crown Prince of Greece\\", and the title has thus re- surfaced from time to time, but neither of the successive Crown Princes of Greece have ever been officially styled thus. The term Diadochos (literally, \\"heir\\"), which is a functional description and does not have any connotations of a title of nobility, has been historically employed to denote the position of heir-apparent in general‚Äînot limited to the Greek throne‚Äîinstead.

The first Crawley station was situated immediately adjacent to the main High Street, with station buildings on the north side of the railway line. With the continued development of the New Town during the 1950s and 1960s it soon became clear that the station was too small, and a new station building was opened 28 July 1968 at the current site. The new station was funded by a six-storey commercial development above the new British Rail station. The original station buildings were demolished in August 1968, but the platforms still survive. A planning application was approved in 16 August 2016 for the demolition and redevelopment of the station buildings to include residential apartments, retail space and multi-storey car parking. In 2020, an accessible footbridge with lifts was installed. It is due to open by autumn 2020.

He was born at Grenoble and was educated for the priesthood at the seminary of St. Sulpice, in Paris. In 1774-1775 he was the Conclavist of Cardinal de Luynes in the papal election that produced Pope Pius VI (Braschi). He was made secretary, then coadjutor, and in 1790, successor, to his uncle, the Bishop of Troyes. In 1790, he refused to take the oath to the civil constitution of the clergy, explaining his views and those of the Pope to the electors of his diocese in a pamphlet in the form of a letter. He then withdrew from France to Konstanz in Switzerland and later to England. In 1801 he returned home, and wrote a forceful pamphlet on the subject of bishops resigning their offices at the request of Pope Pius VII. Under the new concordat between France and the Holy See, Barral was appointed to govern the Diocese of Meaux, and in 1805 was promoted to the Archbishopric of Tours. During the long and harassing negotiations which Napoleon carried on with Pope Pius VII, while the latter was virtually a prisoner at Savona and Fontainebleau, Archbishop de Barral acted frequently as the emperor's intermediary. He was afterwards appointed almoner to the Empress Josephine, and he pronounced her funeral oration. Later still he was named a Senator and a Count of the Empire. On the downfall of Napoleon, the archbishop took his seat in the Chamber of Peers under Louis XVIII, and in the government of the \\"Hundred Days\\", which followed on the return of Napoleon from Elba, he still retained his political position. On the second restoration of the Bourbons, however, he was obliged to resign, and from this time till his death, which occurred in the following year, he confined himself entirely to the administration of his archdiocese. He has left among other works: Fragments relatifs √† l'histoire eccl√©siastique des premi√®res ann√©es du XIXe si√®cle (Paris, 1814); and a posthumous work, published by his brother: D√©fense des libert√©s de l'√©glise gallicane et de l'assembl√©e du clerg√© de France tenue en 1682, ou r√©futation de plusieurs ouvrages publi√©s r√©cemment en Angleterre sur l'infaillibilit√© du Pape (Paris, 1817).

Vortices in a 200-nm-thick YBCO film imaged by scanning SQUID microscopy In superconductivity, a type-II superconductor is a superconductor which exhibits an intermediate phase of mixed ordinary and superconducting properties at intermediate temperature and fields above the superconducting phases. It also features the formation of magnetic field vortices with an applied external magnetic field. This occurs above a certain critical field strength Hc1. The vortex density increases with increasing field strength. At a higher critical field Hc2, superconductivity is destroyed. Type-II superconductors do not exhibit a complete Meissner effect. History In 1935, Rjabinin and ShubnikovRjabinin, J. N. and Schubnikow, L.W. (1935) \\"Magnetic properties and critical currents of superconducting alloys\\", Physikalische Zeitschrift der Sowjetunion, vol. 7, no.1, pp. 122‚Äì125. experimentally discovered the Type-II superconductors. In 1950, the theory of the two types of superconductors was further developed by Lev Landau and Vitaly Ginzburg in their paper on Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory.Ginzburg, V.L. and Landau, L.D. (1950) Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 20, 1064 In their argument, a type-I superconductor had positive free energy of the superconductor-normal metal boundary. Ginzburg and Landau pointed out the possibility of type-II superconductors that should form inhomogeneous state in strong magnetic fields. However, at that time, all known superconductors were type-I, and they commented that there was no experimental motivation to consider precise structure of type-II superconducting state. The theory for the behavior of the Type-II superconducting state in magnetic field was greatly improved by Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov, who was elaborating on the ideas by Lars Onsager and Richard Feynman of quantum vortices in superfluids. Quantum vortex solution in a superconductor is also very closely related to Fritz London's work on magnetic flux quantization in superconductors. The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the theory of Type-II superconductivity in 2003.A. A. Abrikosov, \\"Type II superconductors and the vortex lattice\\", Nobel Lecture, December 8, 2003 Vortex state Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory defines two parameters: The superconducting coherence length and the London magnetic field penetration depth. In a type-II superconductor, the coherence length is smaller than the penetration depth. This leads to negative energy of the interface between superconducting and normal phases. The existence of the negative interface energy was known since the mid-1930s from the early works by the London brothers. A negative interface energy suggests that the system should be unstable against maximizing the number of such interfaces, which was not observed in first experiments on superconductors, before the experiments of Shubnikov in 1936 where two critical fields were found. In 1952 observation of type-II superconductivity was also reported by Zavaritskii. As was later discussed by A. A. Abrikosov, these interfaces manifest as lines of magnetic flux passing through the material, turning a region of the superconductor normal. This normal region is separated from the rest of the superconductor by a circulating supercurrent. In analogy with fluid dynamics, the swirling supercurrent creates what is known as a vortex, or an Abrikosov vortex, after Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov. In the limit of very short coherence length the vortex solution is identical to London's fluxoid, where vortex core is approximated by sharp cutoff rather than gradually vanishing of superconducting condensate near the vortex center. Abrikosov found that the vortices arrange themselves into a regular array known as a vortex lattice. Flux pinning In the vortex state, a phenomenon known as flux pinning, where a superconductor is pinned in space above a magnet, becomes possible. This is not possible with type-I superconductors, since they cannot be penetrated by magnetic fields.Rosen, J., Ph.D., & Quinn, L. \\"Superconductivity\\". In K. Cullen (ed.), Encyclopedia of physical science. Since the superconductor is pinned above the magnet away from any surfaces, there is the potential for a frictionless joint. The worth of flux pinning is seen through many implementations such as lifts, frictionless joints, and transportation. The thinner the superconducting layer, the stronger the pinning that occurs when exposed to magnetic fields. Materials Type-II superconductors are usually made of metal alloys or complex oxide ceramics. All high temperature superconductors are type-II superconductors. While most elemental superconductors are type-I, niobium, vanadium, and technetium are elemental type-II superconductors. Boron-doped diamond and silicon are also type-II superconductors. Metal alloy superconductors also exhibit type-II behavior (e.g. niobium-titanium and niobium-tin). Other type-II examples are the cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials which have achieved the highest superconducting critical temperatures. These include La1.85Ba0.15CuO4, BSCCO, and YBCO (Yttrium-Barium-Copper-Oxide), which is famous as the first material to achieve superconductivity above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77 K). Due to strong vortex pinning, the cuprates are close to ideally hard superconductors. Important uses Strong superconducting electromagnets (used in MRI scanners, NMR machines, and particle accelerators) often use coils wound of niobium-titanium wires or, for higher fields, niobium-tin wires. These materials are type-II superconductors with substantial upper critical field Hc2, and in contrast to e.g. the cuprate superconductors with even higher Hc2, they can be properly machined into wires.

It is located in its capital, South Tarawa, which is a group of islets in the atoll of Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands, precisely on Bonriki. Fiji's national carrier, Fiji Airways connects Kiribati with Nadi, which is Fiji Airways' hub and Fiji's main international gateway. Nauru Airlines flies to Nauru International Airport, continuing to Honiara, the capital of Solomon Islands, and further to Brisbane, Australia. This service was suspended from July 2008 to November 2009, but later replaced by the same route with Solomon Airlines (Bonriki-Honiara-Brisbane). The airport is the hub of the only two Kiribati airlines, flag carrier Air Kiribati and the 2009-established Coral Sun Airways, with both airlines mainly flying domestic routes within the Gilbert Islands. Air Kiribati and Coral Sun Airways both serve all 16 other airports in the Gilbert Islands, but not all these destinations are flown directly from Tarawa. Coral Sun Airways is considering buying another, larger aircraft, capable of flying to the Phoenix Islands and Line Islands. As of 2018, only the Line Islands can be flown to, but these can only be reached by flying via Fiji. History 250px Bonriki Airport in January 2016 The airport was built in December 1943 by United States Navy Seabees and was named \\"Mullinix Field\\", in honor of Rear Admiral Henry M. Mullinix, who died in the sinking of the USS Liscome Bay on 24 November 1943 after it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine off the Gilbert Islands. Almost immediately after the completion of the runway, it became the nexus of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) operations from Tarawa, as the runway at nearby Hawkins Field on Betio was too short for safe bomber operations. The longer runway at Mullinix became the base for the VII Bomber Command Headquarters, which directed operations against Japanese forces in the Marshall Islands. In addition, the USAAF stationed the B-24 Liberator-equipped 11th Bombardment Group and B-25 Mitchell-equipped 41st Bombardment Group at the airfield. In April 1944, the land-based units moved forward to Kwajalein Airfield in the Marshall Islands, and shortly thereafter, Mullinix was reduced to an emergency airfield. By the end of the war, the Americans abandoned the facilities and the airfield was turned into a civilian airport. Maurer, Maurer (1983). Air Force Combat Units Of World War II.

Norman represented Glen Iris in the Victorian Legislative Assembly for four years, and led the Liberal and Country Party from 1951-1952\\\\. Norman was a staunch Methodist and an equally staunch conservative. He held strong small government views, and had little patience for the \\"socialism\\" of the Labor Party. Born in Melbourne, Norman attended primary school in Malvern and went on to University High School. Upon graduation at the age of 15, he joined an accounting firm as a clerk. He took night classes in accountancy during his employment there, and at the age of 22, left the firm to set up his own practice, Norman and Cartledge. At the outbreak of World War II, Norman enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force and was posted in Malaya with the Australian 8th Division. He was captured in Singapore in 1942, and forced to sit out the rest of the war in Changi Prison. The prison at the time also housed Wilfrid Kent Hughes, Tom Mitchell, and William Leggatt, and the four would often discuss politics together. Norman entered the war as a Private, and left as a Lieutenant. After the war, Norman resumed his accounting practice. In 1947, Norman won the electorate of Glen Iris. He became the Government Whip under Thomas Hollway in 1948. The Hollway government was defeated by the Country Party in 1950, and in 1951 Norman took over leadership from Hollway, amidst internal dissent over Hollway's plans to redistribute the seats of Victoria and reduce the power of rural electorates. Norman's reign was short-lived, however, and he lost his seat in 1952 to a challenge from Hollway. He left politics and returned to his accounting practice. He also became active with various charities, acting as Vice-President of the Australian Red Cross and, as a member of Moral Re-Armament, working towards reconciliation with the Japanese. Norman died in 1997 at the age of 83, and is survived by his wife Nina, ex-wife Rosa, and children Douglas and Anne. References *\\"Condolences: Hon.

At that time, it had only seven classes with a head-mistress and seven teachers. It was the only government co-educational school in the Crown Colony then and also a feeder school to Raffles Institution. In 1937, three standards were added and with this, the school provided education up to Secondary Three in present-day terms. The boys and girls who successfully completed Standard Eight then went on to Raffles Institution and Raffles Girls‚Äô School respectively. With the formation of the first School Certificate class in 1949, the school became a full school offering education from Primary One to Cambridge School Certificate. In 1958, the school became a secondary school and seven years later, the first Pre- University class was formed. This section was soon expanded to include two Pre-University One classes and two Pre-University Two classes. Serangoon Secondary School (1967-present) The school shifted to Lowland Road in 1967 and also changed its name to Serangoon Secondary School. In 1976, owing to the establishment of Junior Colleges for Pre-University students, the Pre- University section of the school was closed.

The reorganization of Pennsylvania State Forests that took effect July 1, 2005, added the southern part of Luzerne County to District #11 (it was previously in the defunct Wyoming State Forest). Other aspects of the realignment include moving the District #11 office from Scranton north to Lackawanna State Park, and the acquisition of a new tract, \\"Theta Forest\\" (not included in the description above). History Entering the Lackawanna State Forest  Depletion of Natural Resources  Pinchot State Forest was formed in response to the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock feared that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and Iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests on a massive scale. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. Conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests.  Legislative Response  A change began in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system. Pinchot State Forest began a few years later, in 1902, with the purchase of of land in Thornhurst Township, Lackawanna County, from William and Catherine McMurtry for $3,567.40. It was originally known as Lackawanna State Forest.  Expansion and Renaming  From 2005 to 2015, the state forest expanded from to the present day acreage of . New holdings included in Mocanaqua, the Seven Tubs Recreation Area, at Deep Hollow, the Moon Lake State Forest Recreation Area, and on Montage Mountain. In 2015, Lackawanna State Forest was renamed Pinchot State Forest in honor of Gifford Pinchot.

The resultant is considered a distinct molecular species. Examples include the addition of sodium bisulfite to an aldehyde to give a sulfonate. It can just be considered as a single product resulting from direct addition of different molecules and constitutes all the reactant molecules' atoms. Adducts often form between Lewis acids and Lewis bases. A good example is the formation of adducts between the Lewis acid borane and the oxygen atom in the Lewis bases, tetrahydrofuran (THF): BH3¬∑O(CH2)4 or diethyl ether: BH3¬∑O(CH3CH2)2. Many Lewis acids and Lewis bases reacting in the gas phase or in non aqueous solvents to form adducts have been examined in ECW model. Trimethylboron, Trimethyltin chloride and bis(hexafluoroacetylacetonato)copper(II) are examples of Lewis acids that forms adducts that exhibit steric effects. As an example, Trimethyltin chloride when reacting with diethyl ether, exhibits steric repulsion between the methyl groups on the Sn and the ethyl groups on oxygen. But when the Lewis base is tetrahydrofuran, steric repulsion is reduced. The ECW model can provide a measure of this steric effects. {class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"margin:0.2em auto\\" |+ Ball and stick diagram of the Lewis adduct between BH3 and THF Image:Tetrahydrofuran-3D-balls.png|THF molecule Image:Borane-3D-balls.png|BH3 molecule Image:Borane-THF- adduct-3D-balls.png|Lewis adduct between BH3 and THF, |} Compounds or mixtures that cannot form an adduct because of steric hindrance are called frustrated Lewis pairs. Adducts are not necessarily molecular in nature. A good example from solid-state chemistry is the adducts of ethylene or carbon monoxide of CuAlCl4. The latter is a solid with an extended lattice structure. Upon formation of the adduct, a new extended phase is formed in which the gas molecules are incorporated (inserted) as ligands of the copper atoms within the structure. This reaction can also be considered a reaction between a base and a Lewis acid with the copper atom in the electron-receiving role and the pi electrons of the gas molecule in the electron-donating role. Adduct ions An adduct ion is formed from a precursor ion and contains all of the constituent atoms of that ion as well as additional atoms or molecules. Adduct ions are often formed in a mass spectrometer ion source.

It developed and operates the Transport Direct Portal which is a public facing multi-modal journey planner. It also supports the creation and management of comprehensive databases of all public transport movements in the United Kingdom with Traveline. During 2010 two key datasets were released as Open Data and published on www.data.gov.uk . The closure of the portal was announced in September 2014 and the portal closed on 30 September 2014. Transport Direct Portal The journey planner was a public- facing multi-modal door-to-door journey planner website for Great Britain which provided options for both public transport and car-based options and included an option for cyclists in some parts of the country. Standards A number of data standards were developed to support the collection, transfer and management of the required transport data:- *CycleNetXChange a UK data protocol for exchanging information about infrastructure to support the development of a national cycle journey planning function within the Transport Direct Portal. *IFOPT, a CEN standard for defining public transport access information (building on NaPTAN and NPTG). *JourneyWeb, a protocol to allow the development of a distributed journey planning service (which became the Transport Direct Portal). *NaPTAN for the exchange of information associated with bus stops, railway station and other public transport access point. *NPTG for the exchange of information about places and points of interest. *SIRI, a CEN standard for exchanging real-time public transport information. *TransXChange, a UK data protocol for the exchange of public transport schedules in conjunction with Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, Arriva and Stagecoach Group Other organisations involved in this work included Traveline, the Real Time Information Group (RTIG), the Association of Transport Coordinating Officers (ATCO) and the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT) as well a number of system suppliers. Data resources The development of Transport Direct has created a number of comprehensive national datasets to support the Transport Direct Portal. The assessment of accessibility to services by public transport was made a requirement for the Local Transport Plans in 2004. Measuring the level of accessibility required the use of the data collected by Transport Direct. This data is being used by an increasing number of 3rd parties, including Google Transit (South East Traveline Region) and East Anglia / East Midlands Traveline Regions. MySociety's Mapumental accessibility product. During 2010 increasing amounts of data has become available as Open Data including NaPTAN and NPTDR. National Public Transport Access Nodes database (NaPTAN) The National Public Transport Access Node (NaPTAN) dataset is a UK nationwide system for uniquely identifying all the points of access to public transport in the UK. The dataset, which is open data contains details of some 360,000 nodes including every UK railway station, bus station (Coach station), airport, ferry terminal, bus stop, taxi rank or other place where public transport can be joined; it also details all public entrances to transport hubs and can contain details of airport gates, railway platforms and ferry berths. Each element is allocated a unique 'NaPTAN identifier'. Each entry is linked with one or more localities in the National Public Transport Gazetteer. It is updated on data.gov.uk every three months. The CEN standard (Identification of Fixed Objects In Public Transport or 'IFOPT') integrates many concepts used in the NaPTAN standard into a European standard for stop identification as an extension to Transmodel which is the European standard for Public Transport information. National Public Transport Gazetteer The National Public Transport Gazetteer is a dataset detailing some 50,000 place names for cities, town, villages, hamlets and suburbs in the UK. It is available as open data from data.gov.uk. National Public Transport Data Repository The National Public Transport Data Repository (NPTDR) is a snapshot of all public transport schedules for the UK including bus, tram, train, ferry coach and rail. A dataset is created each year for October and the most recent version is available as open data from data.gov.uk. It was originally created for use by local authorities and other organisations in the production of accessibility strategies, which was a requirement for Local Transport Plan. The data repository was first set up in 2004, and an annual snapshot of data has been created each year since then. Data is collected for all public transport services running in Great Britain during a full week in October each year. It is supplied by Traveline regions and the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) and processed into files for each local authority, broken down further into files for each transport mode. The data in the repository is in both ATCO.CIF and TransXChange technical formats, rather than in a format that would be readily recognised as a timetable. NPTDR was made available as Open Data in September 2010, with new October 2010 data released in March 2011 (Previously there was a charge made for this dataset). Datasets available: *October 2004 dataset *October 2005 dataset *October 2006 dataset *October 2007 dataset *October 2008 dataset *October 2009 dataset *October 2010 dataset National Coach Services Database The National Coach Services Database contains details of all 'limited-stop coach services' in the UK, including those of National Express Coaches, Megabus, Easybus and Scottish Citylink This dataset is not available as open data. National Car Parks Database The National Car Parks dataset contains details of every public car park in the country and also every Park and Ride site. This dataset is not available as open data. National public transport dataset During 2009-10 Traveline has been developing a national dataset covering local transport details for all parts of the UK which will be updated every week (rather than once a year with the NPTDR). It has an associated data sharing agreement defining how it can be used by 3rd parties. The dataset current does not include rail or coach services. Cycle routes database Transport Direct has been contracting companies to survey parts of the UK to provide information to support the cycle journey planning function of the Transport Direct Portal which has been developed in association with Cycling England. Data is stored in the CycleNetXChange format developed for the purpose and is based on the \\"Ordnance Survey DNF Digital National Framework for referencing objects and the ITN (Integrated Transport Network)\\". Open data considerations All the transport schedules were initially closed data covered by Crown copyright. In March 2009 the Cabinet Office published the 'Power of Information Taskforce Report' which noted that although the National Public Transport Data Repository described itself as ‚ÄòCrown Copyright‚Äô investigation showed that the database was not actually government data and also that there were significant changes for reuse of the NPTDR dataset. The report suggested that there should be a presumption in favour of information which has been created by public sector bodies being available for re-use. It is suggested that there should be a clear and consistent copyright and licensing rules applied making it easy to work with data from multiple sources in the public sector. It recommended the a 'Crown Commons' style approach with \\"highly permissive licensing scheme that is transparent, easy to understand and easy to use, modeled on the 'Click Use' license\\" should be developed. In December 2009 Local Transport Today reported that 'Data release could spark transport IT innovations\\". The magazine reported that \\"Among the data to be made accessible through the site are trunk road traffic volumes, the National Public Transport Access Node (NaPTAN) database and the National Public Transport Data Repository (NPTDR)\\". A DfT spokeswoman was reported to say: ‚ÄúWe will seek to embrace new technology to enable partners to provide exciting, user-focused services such as recently seen with satellite navigation and iPhone applications,‚Äù In March 2010 the Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that the NaPTAN dataset was to be immediately made available from the data.gov.uk site as Open Data, as well as confirming an impending release of Ordnance Survey data. In his speech he observed that at present public transport timetables and real-time running information was owned by the operating companies but that the government would work to free it up. He also said that \\"from today we will make it a condition of future franchises that this data will be made freely available\\". NPTDR was made available as Open Data in September 2010. Costs The costs of operating Transport Direct and creating the associated portal are funded by central Government. The data used by the portal is created and maintained by a range of other organisations. Work commissioned by the Department in 2000 indicated that the services that Transport Direct seeks to deliver would not be provided by the private sector. The cost of the Transport Direct Programme (Portal and other necessary works) from April 2003 to March 2006 was ¬£45 million up for the period April 2003 to March 2006 until then ¬£10 million for the period April 2006 to March 2007. The Portal itself cost ¬£5.9 million for the period April 2006 to March 2007. The 10 millionth user session took place on 1 December 2006 with the number of session steadily growing over time; 1.126 million user sessions were recorded for August 2007. A Freedom of Information request was made on 4 January 2006 that requested details of the cost of the development of the Transport Direct portal. History Context Bus deregulation in Great Britain in 1985 allowed operators to determine routes and frequencies (except in London which were normally prepared by hand and few transport authorities had databases giving the name and locations of bus stops, and where they did they were in a locally developer format. Bus operators were required register their schedules with VOSA which they did on paper at timing point level together with a prose description of the route. An additional problem was that a single bus stop could be served by multiple bus operators who would typically use different names for the same bus stop. The Bus wars in the early period of deregulation added to the confusion and printer timetables at bus stops largely disappeared as bus companies cut costs. In 1986 during the conservative government the M25 motorway was opened by Margaret Thatcher and then in 1989 a white paper titled \\"Roads for Prosperity\\" was published which was heralded as 'the biggest road building program since the Romans'. Within a few years however, the M25 was carrying far more traffic than was predicted and plans were drawn up to widen the entire motorway. Other road schemes, including the M3 motorway at Twyford Down, the M11 link road, the Newbury bypass etc. were met with unprecedented levels of opposition which led to a review of transport policy starting in the mid-1990s. Stephen Norris, later to become a strong advocate of cycling and public transport, was appointed as Under-Secretary of State for Transport in 1992 and in 1994 a new revised edition of Planning Policy Guidance 13 acknowledged officially for the first time that new roads lead to additional traffic making new roads much harder to justify; in July the Secretary of State for Transport Brian Mawhinney launched what he termed a 'Great Debate' over about the future direction for transport in the UK; and then in October a major Royal Commission report, Transport and the Environment was published which highlighted the serious environmental consequences of UK's car-based transport system. By the end of 1995 many road schemes had been canceled and the incoming Labour government following the 1997 general election canceled many of the remaining schemes. Under New Labour, John Prescott, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions wanted to an increased role for public transport; Labour's first transport white paper \\"A New Deal for Transport: Better for everyone\\" was published in 1998 which included a commitment to create a national multi-modal transport information system by the end of 2000. A subsequent White Paper, the 'Transport Ten Year Plan 2000' provided more details of the required work. The project would:- \\"Stimulate the transport sector to develop high quality information systems\\", \\"Enable users to find all available electronic travel information\\", \\"Develop integrated information and ticket sales for journeys involving more than one mode of transport\\" and \\"Deliver an integrated and comprehensive information service for all travel modes and mode combinations, which was implemented as the Transport Direct Portal.\\" Development Given the capabilities of the computers at the time it was not considered feasible at the time to operate a national journey planner, so a regional approach was chosen. The Confederation of Passenger Transport agreed to set up Traveline in 2000 which would include representatives from local government and from the transport operators. Traveline then organised itself into a regional structure, each of which would develop systems for providing information from telephone call centres in time over the internet. Initially paper timetables were used while the necessary information systems and supporting datasets were developed. A basic file format for the exchange of transport schedules was available and was updated in 2000 to accommodate some of the requirements of the new project. A contract to develop the Transport Direct Portal was awarded in 2002 to Atos Origin which would provide a single access point to the journey planners being developed by each of the Traveline regions. A specification for the National Public Transport Access Nodes (NaPTAN) database, which would hold the details of every station, coach terminus, airport, ferry terminal, bus stop, etc. in Great Britain was published in December 2002 together with the associated NPTG standard was also defined and was populated with 50,000 commonly used place names and major points of interest. A GPS survey of the country was carried out to populate the new database. On completion the NaPTAN database detailed 360,000 Stop Points. Also in 2002 Transport Direct also managed a program for the Department for Transport to invest ¬£20m into real-time Passenger information system to 19 local authorities in the UK to increase the uptake of this technology which was already being developed in a number of places. An initial specification for a new more comprehensive standard for the exchange of public transport data ( TransXChange) was completed in 2003 although much of the schedule data was still transferred using a simpler 'ATCO CIF' file format. Data for the portal was collected from some 200 organisations. A data standard for the exchange of real time public transport information was completed in 2003. RTIG-XML, a data standard for the exchange of real time public transport information was completed in 2003. A prototype national door- to-door journey for Great Britain (i.e. UK without Northern Ireland) was available by November 2003 to 'stakeholders and key opinion formers' and was officially launched by Alistair Darling, the Secretary of State for Transport on 31 December 2004. The integration of public transport and car journey planning on this scale was claimed as a world-first. To put the project in perspective, it was launched prior to the existence of Google Maps (early in 2005) and routing of public transport on Google Maps was not released until December 2005 and this service required a feed of data of the type being collected by Transport Direct. Operation From 2004 Transport Direct has operated the Transport Direct Portal in using the Traveline regional planners from which it is constructed. During 2005 Transport Direct was re-organised into three service areas to: * Provide travel information services directly to users through the Transport Direct Portal; * Provide travel information services through valued-adding third parties such as the BBC, Google, Directgov(provided by Transport Direct, National Rail Enquiries, Visit Britain and the UK Department for Work and Pensions; * Work with and orchestrate the travel and transport information communities within the UK, Europe and internationally to promote the use of standards and common processes to deliver an effective transport information supply chain. A database of public transport schedules (known as 'National Public Transport Data Repository' or NPTDR) was first assembled in 2004 covering a week in October. This data could be used with the 'Accession' software, developed with funding from the Department for Transport for analysis accessibility to services which was a requirement for the Local Transport Plans in development at the time by every Transport Authority. A similar dataset has been collected every subsequent year. Information was made available from the portal through additional channels during the year, including PDAs, mobile phones and via interactive television via BSkyB, cable and Freeview set-top boxes with a modem or broadband connection. In 2006 Transport Direct started FareXChange, a technical standard for the exchange of information about public transport fares. Also in 2006 the Service Interface for Real Time Information (SIRI), which was developed with support from Transport Direct was adopted as a CEN standard. In 2007 data for buses and coaches in the South East England Traveline Region was made available to Google Transit. This did not however include the rail information which is available through Transport Direct but for which 3rd parties are required to deal directly with Network Rail or for London (which is only available to 3rd parties from Transport for London). In November 2008 the final (version 1.0) draft of Identification of Fixed Objects In Public Transport (IFOPT), a CEN standard for describing public transport interchanges was completed. In December 2008 the Department released NaPTAN data for use in OpenStreetMap and after an import process was defined the first a data for many places including London had been imported by August 2009. In March 2009 Transport Direct added cycle journey planning to the Portal for Manchester and Merseyside. CycleStreets, a national cycle journey planner using OpenStreetMap data was launched as beta in the same month. In June 2009 MySociety launched a beta version of Mapumental which shows travel time by different modes of public transport within a time limit for anywhere in Great Britain using the NPTDR dataset. In July 2009 Cycling England (funded by the Department for Transport) 'urged' local authorities across England to help develop a cycle journey planner for the Government‚Äôs Transport Direct website and offered matched funding for the cost of collecting the data. In November 2009 data for the East Anglia and East Midlands Traveline Regions were made available to Google Transit. Again, only bus and coach information is available through Google. In January 2010 Cycle City Guides were contracted to survey further cycle routes with an eventual aim of providing coverage for every urban area in England with a population over 30,000. In March 2010 the NaPTAN dataset was made available as Open Data from data.gov.uk. In the same month Google Maps launched a cycling routing function for 150 cities in the United States. Google also announced that it had made Google Streetview available for virtually every road in the United Kingdom. In September 2010 the National Public Transport Data Repository was made available on data.gov.uk as Open Data. Transport for London made their current public transport schedules available to same month from the London datastore.

It was established in 1905 by the Heliopolis Oasis Company headed by the Belgian industrialist √âdouard Empain and by Boghos Nubar, son of the Egyptian Prime Minister Nubar Pasha. It is the location of the Cairo International Airport. The population of Heliopolis is estimated at some 142,968 individuals (2016).  History  Suburban avenues in HeliopolisSaint Mark's Church, one of the oldest Coptic church in Heliopolis Heliopolis ‚Äì Boulevard Ibrahim Baron Empain, a well- known amateur Egyptologist and prominent Belgian entrepreneur, arrived in Egypt in January 1904, intending to rescue one of his Belgian wife's development projects: the construction of a railway line linking Al-Matariyyah to Port Said. Despite losing the railway contract to the British, Empain stayed on in Egypt. In 1905, Empain established the Cairo Electric Railways and Heliopolis Oases Company, which bought a large stretch of desert some distance to the northeast of Cairo at a low price from the British occupation government. His efforts culminated in 1907 with the building of the new town of Heliopolis, in the Sahara desert ten kilometers from the center of Cairo. The new city represented the first large-scale attempt to promote its own architecture, known now as the Heliopolis style. It was designed as a \\"city of luxury and leisure\\", with broad avenues and equipped with all conveniences and infrastructure: water, drains, electricity, hotel facilities, such as the Heliopolis Palace Hotel and Heliopolis House, and recreational amenities including a golf course, racetrack and park. In addition, there was housing for rent, offered in a range of innovative designs targeting specific social classes with detached and terraced villas, apartment buildings, tenement blocks with balcony access and workers' bungalows. Baron Empain's own residence adopted a unique south Asian architectural style. Alexander Marcel, a French architect and a member of the prestigious French Institute, was commissioned by Empain to build him a Hindu style palace. Modelled on Angkor Wat in Cambodia and the Hindu temples of Orissa, the palace was erected between 1907 and 1910. It still stands today, remaining one of the finest examples of early creative use of concrete, of which it was entirely built. The neighborhood had some of the wealthiest Egyptian residences; on the left facing Avenue Baron was the Arabesque palace of Boghos and Marie Nubar Pasha, now a military headquarters. The Pasha assisted Baron Empain in purchasing the 6,000 acres (24 km¬≤) of open desert, at one pound each, on which he built Heliopolis. Diagonally opposite stands the former residence of Sultan Hussein Kamel, who reigned over Egypt between 1914 and 1917. Today, it is a presidential guest house. The Heliopolis War Cemetery is on Nabil el Wakkad street. This cemetery contains the Port Tewfik Memorial, a memorial to over 4000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who fell in the First World War, which was originally in Port Taufiq but was relocated to Heliopolis after its destruction in the 1970s.http://www.cwgc.org/find-a- cemetery/cemetery/2018702/Heliopolis%20War%20Cemetery Modern Heliopolis was originally filled primarily with aristocratic Egyptians, as well as some European nationals. Unlike other modern Cairene suburbs around the start of the 20th century, Heliopolis had a significantly larger percentage of Egyptian citizen residents. After the 1952 revolution led by Nasser, it became home to much of Cairo's educated middle class. As Cairo has expanded, the once large distance between Heliopolis and Cairo has vanished and it is now well inside the city. Because of the large growth in population, the original gardens that filled the city have mostly been built over.  Religion  Our Lady of Heliopolis Co-Cathedral on Al-Ahram street is a famous landmark in Heliopolis, and it is the burial place of Baron Empain. Since 1886, Heliopolis was the seat of the Latin Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Heliopolis (founded as Apostolic Prefecture of the Nile Delta) until its title was merged in 1987 into the Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria of Egypt. Its Marian former Our Lady cathedral remains a Co-cathedral. The many places of worship in the district, including Islamic mosques, Saint Mark's Church in Cleopatra street, Saint George's church in Heliopolis Square, Christian Saint Maron (Maronite, not the St. Joseph cathedral elsewhere in Cairo) and Saint-Rita church, and the Jewish Al Missalah Street synagogue, demonstrate that the city has been living in religious tolerance since it was established. There are 16 major mosques and Islamic charities located within Heliopolis, including the Imam Hassan, Revolution, and Omar bin Abdul Aziz mosques.  Recreational facilities  right Heliopolis contains recreational places, as it was initially established to offer its residents and visitors rest and relaxation. Heliopolis club is one of the most luxurious sporting clubs in Egypt. It was established along with Heliopolis in 1905. From 1911 until 1915, Heliopolis had Luna Park, Africa's first amusement park (the grounds were converted into an Australian field hospital just after the onset of World War I). The Merryland is also a famous recreational park; it contains a lake and was at the height of its elegance in the 1960s and 70s. It now contains a small amusement park. Other sporting clubs include El Shams Club (biggest in size and number of members), Heliolido club, El-Ghaba club, El-Tayaran club and others. Heliopolis contains modern cafes (including Harris, Starbucks, Cilantro, Costa Coffee, and Beanos) and restaurants along with some Egyptian traditional ones. Some bars and nightclubs can be found. Tens of cinemas can be found in Heliopolis and its extension, Madinet nasr (Nasr City), Normandy Cinema in Al-Ahram street, Cinema Roxy, Cinema Heliopolis along with the new cinemas in Horia Mall and City Stars, one of the best-known shopping malls in Egypt.  Political importance  Heliopolis gained a special political and military importance in Egypt and the Middle East in recent decades. The Egyptian Military headquarters and the Egyptian Air Force headquarters are there. The Almaza Military Airbase is very close to Heliopolis. The regional headquarters of some international organizations such as the World Health Organization and the Red Crescent are in Heliopolis. Heliopolis was the residence of the Egyptian ex-president Mohamed Hosni Mubarak. In 1981, the site of Heliopolis Palace Hotel became the Egyptian Republican Palace () and the president's office.  The present and the future  In contrast with its initial establishment as a quiet suburb, Heliopolis now is considered a main part of Cairo. It is home to celebrities, football players, politicians and wealthy families. The numbers of residents have doubled several times since 1922. A tram system used to serve Heliopolis and parts of the surrounding area but it has been almost entirely closed, and partly removed, in 2015. Heliopolis was already integrated into the existing underground system to link it to other pivotal residential areas all around Cairo. Several major areas of Heliopolis such as El-Ahram street, El-Marghany street and Fair Zone are already formal destinations in the newly developed Metro stations belonging to Line 3, with a plan to extend the line to include other stations such as Nozha and Cairo International Airport.

Ingredients  The dish is made of yellow egg noodles, which are also used in Hokkien mee, with a spicy slightly sweet curry-like gravy. The gravy is made from shrimp or tauchu broth, shallots, lemongrass, galangal, salam leaf (Indonesian bayleaf), kaffir lime leaf, gula jawa (Indonesian dark palm sugar), salt, water, and corn starch as thickening agent. The dish is garnished with a hard boiled egg, dried shrimp, boiled potato, calamansi limes, spring onions, Chinese celery, green chillies, fried firm tofu (tau kwa), fried shallots and bean sprouts. Some eateries serve it with beef, though rarely found in hawker centres, or add dark soy sauce to the noodles when served. The dish also goes well with satay. In the past, mi rebus was sold by mobile hawkers who carried two baskets over a pole. One basket contained a stove and a pot of boiling water, and the other the ingredients for the dish.  Similar dishes  In certain areas, a similar variety of Mi Rebus is called Mie Jawa, Mee Jawa, Mi Jawa, Bakmi Jawa or Bakmi Godhog, although this is a popular misnomer, since Mie Jawa is slightly different from Mi Rebus.

It is the largest lake in Kumaon region, known as the \\"lake district of India\\". The lake provides drinking water supply and supports aquaculture with variety of fish species. There is an island at the centre of the lake which has been developed as a tourist attraction and has an aquarium. Geography The lake and the dam are located at an elevation of in Bhimtal town in the Nainital district in Uttarakhand. The lake drains a catchment area of . According to geologists the origin of the lake is attributed to a number of faults which occurred due to shifting of the earth's crust. This caused blockade of the overland flows and resulted in creation of the lake. The catchment area of the lake, particularly the hills have dense forest cover; the type of forest vegetation consists of chir pine, ban oak and mixed deciduous forests. The basin experiences varying tropical to sub-tropical weather conditions. Precipitation in the basin is very high, mostly occurring during the monsoon period. A peripheral road on the banks of the lake provides clear views of fish life in the lake. The lake has steep banks covered with shingle at lower elevations and bushes and grass at higher elevations. The western side of the lake is a forest area where cottages have been built; while on the opposite side there are terraced fields. A perennial tributary stream feeds the lake from the west and the banks of this stream have been extensively developed with residential complexes, after Indian Independence, which has brought in shale and debris into the lake, and this process is said to be still continuing. There is a small shopping centre on the southern shore of the lake. A small sanitarium on the northern shore of the lake at elevation is said to be free from malaria and hence healthy. There is also a prison camp which was established in 1902 here at the northern end of the lake to house prisoners of the Boer war. It is away from the district town of Nainital. Kathgodam is the nearest rail-head which is away. History The dam was built in 1883 when Kumaon region was under the British Raj following the Anglo-Nepal War (1814‚Äì16). Nainital had then been established as their summer capital. The town and the lake are named after Bhima, one of the Pandavas of the epic story of Mahabharata who is said to have visited the place. On the banks of the dam there is an old temple which was built by Raja Baj Bahadur Chand of Kumaon Kingdom during the 17th century. Features Water spread of the lake The \\"C\\" shaped lake, which is the largest in the Kumaon region, impounded by the masonry dam has an area of . It has a gross storage capacity of with a live storage of . The surface inflow into the reservoir is only and the balance storage is contributed by subsurface sources. The reservoir has been classified as manomictic with stratification extending over a period from March to November, with one \\"inner circulation.\\" There is inflow of sediment from the catchment due to intense building activity on the banks. This has necessitated dredging of the lake regularly. Lake water which is generally clear, gets a brown coloration during some months as a result of infused animalcule. According to a local myth the coloration disappears once the lake claims a victim. The stored water is released through an outlet leading to the Gola River which is utilized to supplement the flows of the Bhabar canals. As the reservoir water is released, the water surface area of the lake gets reduced, when the water getting released, by with consequent reduction of the size of the reservoir to half its original spread. Water quality of the lake is in a \\"retrogressive ecological change\\" on account of a) sewage disposal, sediment inflow, and tourists' pressure causing waste disposal. This has resulted in dissolved oxygen level recorded at harmful levels to both domestic consumption and pisciculture. Nitrate level is also stated to be high at 350 mg per liter which is considered a \\"pre-eutrophication stage\\". In the bed of the lake there are deposits of injurious matter and as a result fish mortality rate is high and the quality of drinking water has also suffered. As the lake water is polluted with organic matter, it is in a mesotrophic state due to disposal of sewage directly into the lake from the residential complex built around the periphery of the lake. It has now been planned to build a sewer line around the periphery of the lake to trap all the sewage from the residential areas and prevent it from entering the lake. A treatment plant to treat the waste water is also part of the waste water treatment process. The picturesque island at the middle of the lake has recreation facilities including an aquarium and is approached by rowing boats. Dam The dam which has created the lake is a masonry structure built at the center to a height of . It has a length . The base of the dam at the center has a width of which reduces to a top width of . The dam is designed to pass a flood discharge of through a chute spillway which is fitted with 12 gates. The dam is located in the Seismic Zone IV. Wildlife Wildlife seen around the lake are barking deer, Kalij pheasants, Koklass pheasants white-capped laughingthrush and migratory ducks and geese. Fisheries The fish species found in the lake are common snowtrout, catla, rohu, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Also recorded in the lake waters are Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and major carps (Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala and catla catla). A fish farm has been set up in the Bhima Tal. Every year large fish yields from the lake are of Mahseer, and Tor putitora) species. It is essential to get the permission of the Deputy Commissioner to fish in the lake.

Paulsgrove existed as a small hamlet on the old Portsmouth to Southampton road for many years. During the early twentieth century Paulsgrove Racecourse was built north of the village on the slopes of Portsdown Hill and a railway halt built to cater for raceday traffic.\\"Lost railways of Hampshire\\" Oppitz, L: Newbury, Countryside Books, 2001 The area was incorporated into the city of Portsmouth in 1920. The population of the Portsmouth Ward at the 2011 Census was 14,010. Towards the end of World War II it became clear that to the City Council that a massive programme of house building was needed to replace those homes destroyed by bombing. As part of this programme, land in Paulsgrove was purchased and building began in 1945. The initial housing was prefabricated but later houses were built more conventionally. In August 2000, Paulsgrove made the national and international news as mobs of local residents attacked residences of suspected and convicted child sex offenders and other sex offenders. These disturbances came shortly after the News of the World put pressure on the government to give parents the right to know if their children are living close to a convicted sex offender, in response to the murder of Sarah Payne.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/865289.stmhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bh/1474291.stm Roads Southampton Road was built in 1958, replacing Medina Road as the main route between Portsmouth and Fareham. A strip of open land was left throughout the estate during its construction in the 1950s to make way for the subsequent M27 motorway. Churches *St Michael and All Angels, the parish church of Paulsgrove was established as a mission centre in 1947, whilst work commenced on building a new parish church. St. Michael and All Angels was formerly constituted as an ecclesiastical parish of the Church of England in the Diocese of Portsmouth when the new parish church was consecrated in July 1957. The parish stands in the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England. There have been seven Vicars of the parish since 1957.Father Gary Waddington was vicar of the church from 2000 to 2010. *The Baptist church was built in 1954. It was the members of Kent Street Baptist Church, Portsea, which had been destroyed in the blitz, who decided to plant a church on the new Paulsgrove estate being built in the post-war years. Prior to its building, a Sunday School was run at (then) Paulsgrove Secondary Modern School and there was a regular attendance of about 500 children on a Sunday afternoon. When the Baptist Church opened it was decided to integrate it into the church. Some, if not all of the Sunday School leaders became founder members of the church. *St Paul's church was built in 1970. It is a Roman Catholic church which is situated next to St. Paul's Primary School. The school and church are connected through the Roman Catholic religion, with the schools choir often performing at the church. In the late '90s the school collected awards and trophies for both its sporting achievements as well as several awards for its musical achievements through its choir. Education Paulsgrove Primary School Paulsgrove Secondary Modern School opened in 1952 - it became King Richard School in 1975. In 2007 the school officially became an arts college. This means it is now a performing arts specialist. King Richard has also won and been runners up in the Rock Challenge. In 2006 students from King Richard School won Rock Challenges' stage crew of the year. In 2018 the schoo lwas renamed Castle View Academy. Paulsgrove Primary School opened in the early 1950s to serve a new housing development made necessary by the number of people made homeless through bombing during the Second World War. It was opened by the Lord Mayor of Portsmouth (England), Sir Denis Daley on 24 October.List of Mayors of Portsmouth In January 2013 it changed its name to Beacon View Primary Academy, and had a remodelled exterior look. Sport Paulsgrove F.C. was formed in 1987, and currently play in the Hampshire Premier league at Paulsgrove Social Club, Marsden Road.

However a more likely explanation is revealed by certain old maps which show the area as PALS GRAVE, and is probably a reference to the last resting place of a (perhaps Saxon) local chief.

It is the only congregation of the Church of Scotland in France, part of the International Presbytery. The church itself is incorporated in a modern apartment building, which construction began in 1999 and was completed in 2002. The current church is the third built on the site. The congregation is particularly well known for their former minister Donald Caskie who wrote an account of his exploits during World War II, The Tartan Pimpernel. History l'Oratoire du Louvre, home to the Scots Kirk from 1858 to 1885 Origins The congregation of the Scots Kirk Paris was founded in 1858. The origins of the congregation lie in the arrival of the Scottish theologian John Tulloch who was appointed by the Church of Scotland to establish a Scottish presbyterian church in Paris. In its first years of existence, the congregation was welcomed within l'Oratoire du Louvre where among other recently established English-speaking protestant churches the upper room was lent to them for worship. During the Exposition Universelle of 1867, the whole church of the Oratoire du Louvre was given to the congregation to lead a service on Sundays afternoon, due to the numerous Presbyterians visiting the city of Paris on that occasion. Collections to acquire an own building for the congregation took place during those services. In 1880, the old church Rue Bayard owned by the American Episcopalian parish of the Holy Trinity was put on the market for sale. In 1881 the Scots Kirk Paris congregation made a first contact with them regarding the acquisition of the building. However it was two years later, in 1883, that the church was officially bought. The congregation got the possession of the building granted in 1885 and have worshiped on that site since then. Three church buildings on the same site The first church building had been erected by the American Episcopalian parish of the Holy Trinity between 1863 and 1864, who then moved to their new church in 1885. It was because of this move to a newly built church that they decided to put on sale their old church Rue Bayard. This church was designed in a neo-Gothic style and could host about persons. The recently purchased church then attracted high attendance to the services held during the Exposition Universelle of 1889. Following World War II (when the church was unoccupied), the lack of maintenance led to structural problems and the church had to be rebuilt in the late 1950s. The rebuilding work, however, proved to be unsatisfactory. Major structural faults were soon discovered and by the 1980s the building was again in urgent need of replacement or major repairs. It was decided to completely rebuild, albeit with flats above the new church building. The current church building was opened by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, John Miller, in 2002. Famous visitors The congregation has had many famous visitors, including Queen Elizabeth II who laid the foundation stone for the (since replaced) new sanctuary in 1957. In 1924, during the Olympic Games held in Paris, the athlete Eric Liddell chose to preach at the Scots Kirk instead of running on a Sunday. His story is told in the film Chariots of Fire, but the building used as the Scots Kirk in the film was actually the former Broughton Church in Edinburgh. During the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles both the American President Woodrow Wilson and British Prime Minister David Lloyd George worshipped at the church. Current status The current minister is Rev Jan Steyn who has been minister since April 2017. The members of the congregation having always been widespread throughout the √éle-de-France since the inception of the church. The Scottish diaspora being not numerous, the Scots Kirk Paris has a long history of being an international congregation. So though fully part of the Church of Scotland and conscious of its Scottish connections, the church always primarily seeks to offer English-language presbyterian Christian worship and pastoral care to an international fellowship.

It is the nearest village to the HMNB Clyde naval base. Garelochhead, 7 miles (11 km) northwest of Helensburgh. Loch Lomond is a few miles to the east, and Loch Long to the west. To some the scenic beauty of the loch is only slightly marred by the presence of the HMNB Clyde submarine base and the associated 'peace camp'. In addition to the few local shops, pub and church, it has a bowling club and two community buildings - the Gibson Hall and Centre 81, which is home to Route 81 youth project, gym, caf√©, computer suite and meeting rooms. There is also a gallery featuring work by Scottish artists. It is best known for its famous song, \\"Ghead born and bread, Ghead till i'm Dead\\" Traditionally sung every night before going to sleep. Garelochhead's is served by Garelochhead railway station on the West Highland Line and a local bus service running between Coulport and Helensburgh. History Garelochhead, originally in Dunbartonshire, now in Argyll and Bute, developed from the 1820s with the advent of steamer cruising during the Glasgow Fair holiday. Tourism was boosted with the opening of the West Highland Railway line to Fort William in 1894, and in the late 20th century its prosperity was linked to the deepwater oil tanker terminal at Finnart on Loch Long and the Faslane naval base. Garelochhead Forest lies to the south. In 1854 there was a great dispute that became known as the Battle of Garelochhead fought between the locals, led by Sir James Colquhoun, and the passengers of the steamer Ship \\"Emperor\\". The trouble started when Colquhoun did not want trippers on the sabbath day. The battle was eventually won by the passengers, but undeterred Colquhoun took his case to the courts who subsequently banned sailings on Sundays. Before Faslane naval base was constructed during World War II, Garelochhead was a summer destination for people from Glasgow who would arrive from the Gare Loch and spend time in one of the Garelochhead hotels. Following transport advancements, holidaymakers stopped coming to Garelochhead. Faslane was built after this and extended the town as workers settled in the area. During the 1990s, two of the village's hotels, The Dahlandui and Garelochhead Hotel, burnt down in fires. In the last ten years, due to lack of attendance the local Roman Catholic Chapel has closed down with Garelochhead Parish Church of Scotland Kirk in the village holding a combined congregation of both Protestant and Catholic. The Gibson Hall is commonly used as headquarters for cycle races around the Coulport peninsula, such as the Scottish Cycling national road race that was organised by Lomond Roads Cycling Club..

The military airfield included an airstrip, control tower and facilities, with a radio station at Tepuka, connected by cable to the airfield. The base headquarters buildings were at the present-day Teagai Apelu's residence, and a bunker is there to this day. The first offensive operation was launched on 20 April 1943 when 22 B-24 Liberator aircraft from 371 and 372 Bombardment Squadrons bombed Nauru. The next day the Japanese made a predawn raid on the strip at Funafuti that destroyed one B-24 and caused damage to five other planes. On 22 April, 12 B-24 aircraft bombed Tarawa. Marine Fighting Squadron 441 (VMF-441), flying the F4F Wildcat, operated from Funafuti from May to September 1943. The airfield became the headquarters of the United States Army Air Forces VII Bomber Command in November 1943, which directed operations against Japanese forces on Tarawa and other bases in the Gilbert Islands. The USAAF stationed two B-24 Liberator heavy bomber groups, the 11th Wing and 30th Bombardment Groups on Funafuti in the implementation of Operation Galvanic, which led to the Battle of Tarawa and the Battle of Makin in November 1943. By the middle of 1944, as the fighting moved further north toward Japan, the Americans began to withdraw. By the time the Pacific War ended in 1945, nearly all of them, with their equipment, departed.Maurer, Maurer (1983). Air Force Combat Units Of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. .www.pacificwrecks.com After the war, the military airfield was developed into a commercial airport. Facilities Maneapa and airport building The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway which is in length. The absence of runway lighting, minimal VHF radio and air navigation equipment means that operations are restricted to daylight hours. The runway was originally constructed using coral aggregate and has a sub-base layer of 8 cm thick coral gravel, surfaced with a 1‚Äì2 cm asphalt chip seal. It was resurfaced in 1992 and the runway was rated at 50 tonnes landing capacity; it was reduced to 20 tonnes landing capacity due to sub-surface water, deterioration of the sub- base and lack of surface maintenance. However, the runway was resurfaced in 2015 so that the pavement would be re-rated. The deterioration of the runway's sub-base is a consequence of its low elevation and the hydrologic dynamics in the sub-surface of the atoll. There was extensive swamp reclamation during World War II to create the airfield. About half of Fongafale islet is reclaimed swamp that contains porous, highly permeable coral blocks that allow the tidal forcing of salt water through the sub-base of the runway. This results in salt water pooling on the runway during spring tides. Tuvaluan children watching a plane land at Funafuti International Airport In 2011 World Bank and the government of Tuvalu agreed to commence the Tuvalu Aviation Investment Project (TvAIP) for the purpose of improving operational safety and oversight of international air transport and associated infrastructure at Funafuti International Airport. In November 2013 the World Bank approved US$6.06 million in finance for the TvAIP. Further World Bank funding was provided in 2017. TvAIP is intended to improve the runway so that it achieves a minimum pavement classification number (PCN) of 18 to provide a load- carrying capacity of the pavement that rates the runway for emergency flights. TvAIP also involved improvements of navigational aids and other safety and security facilities to meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) requirements. The airport is somewhat unusual due to limited space on the island, the runway is used as a common area for sporting and social activities when not in use. Sirens sound when a plane is landing, warning civilians to stay clear of the runway. Airlines and destinations. Fiji Link aircraft at Funafuti Up to 1999 Air Marshall Islands operated a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 with a passenger load of 55. In 2001 the government purchased a share of Air Fiji, which provided Tuvalu with greater control of its airline access; however, Air Fiji ceased operations in 2009. Fiji Airways, the owner of Fiji Airlines (trading as Fiji Link) operates services 3 times a week (Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday) between Suva (originating from Nadi) and Funafuti with ATR 72-600 aircraft, which has a capacity of up to 72 passengers. Air Kiribati provides 5 flights a week (Mon., Wed., Fri., Sat., Sun.) to Funafuti from Tarawa at 13h00 arrives there at 16h00; with the return flights departing Funafuti at 17h00 and arriving back in Tarawa at 20h00. The service uses a Bombardier Dash 8 airplane, for 35 passengers.

Blundy, 44, was the Washington reporter for the London Sunday Correspondent newspaper. He was in El Salvador covering the latest fighting in the area. He covered stories in Northern Ireland, the Middle East, and Central America. Personal history Blundy was born in Slinfold, West Sussex, England in the United Kingdom. He grew up in south London near the intersection of Elephant and Castle in a house that was also the location of his father's antique store. He went to the City of London School, and then went on to study English and philosophy at Bristol University. He began work with Thomson Newspapers, but then went to The Sunday Times. He left the Times to become The Sunday Telegraph's Washington correspondent in 1986. In 1989, he began the same position for the Sunday Correspondent. He married Ruth Mansley in 1970, and had one daughter with her. He had another daughter from a relationship with Samira Osman. His two daughters are Anna Blundy and Charlotte Blundy. His funeral service was held at St Michael's Church, Highgate, north London, and he is buried at Highgate Cemetery. Career His career began with a place in the graduate training scheme of Thomson Newspapers. He went from Burnley to Hemel Hempstead before reaching Fleet Street in 1970. Michael Bateman, who wrote The Sunday Times Atticus column, offered him the position of assistant. He was a sharp, funny writer and did not hesitate to be arrested for a story. He was sent to New York as a correspondent, but then was based in the Middle East. He left The Sunday Times for The Sunday Telegraph in 1986 as their Washington correspondent. Earlier in 1989, he took the same position with The Sunday Correspondent. Death Blundy died in El Salvador on 17 November 1989 by a sniper's bullet. Incident Street scene of Mexicanos, El Salvador Blundy was in El Salvador covering a military offensive when he was shot by a sniper while walking down the street with other reporters. The group of reporters was walking in the working-class district of Mejicanos, that had recently been retaken by the army. Gun-fire was being exchanged four blocks away. No one knows who fired the shot. Blundy was wounded by a single shot in his lungs and spine. He underwent surgery, but died of a heart attack some hours later. Reactions Blundy was well regarded in the journalistic community. He was considered a \\"reporter's reporter\\" with a demeanor that intimidated colleagues. He was knowledgeable, successful, and admired. His death brought the number of journalist deaths to 31 in the 10-year civil war in El Salvador. David Blundy Award The David Blundy Award is ¬£500 award given to a reporter living abroad who is not a member of a British newspaper when their articles are published. Reporters must submit a minimum of two articles and a maximum of five. The award is used to encourage freelance journalists whose work is vital to foreign coverage in British Newspapers. It is supported by the three newspapers that Blundy worked: The Sunday Correspondent, The Sunday Telegraph, and The Sunday Times.  Books  *The Last Paragraph.

Harvey Kershaw Beyond the Boundary (Rochdale) p30 Industrial history - mills The power of the River Spodden as it rushes through the gorge at Healey Dell was probably first harnessed in Anglo-Saqxon times to power a corn mill. (The word \\"Healey\\" itself, meaning high pasture, is of Anglo-Saxon origin.) In 1636 the old corn mill became, or was replaced, by a wool fulling mill, and a replacement corn mill was built upstream at Broadley. The remains of the 17th century mill, which was built on a bridge over the river, and known as \\"Th' Owd Mill i' t' Thrutch, may still be seen.Rochdale Literary & Scientific Society Transactions, Vol.XII, cited by John Cole Towering Memorials in Healey Dell of History, Rochdale Observer newspaper, 24.8.1985, pp10-11.

The viaduct has eight arches, built of locally quarried stone, calculated to contain over 4,435 cubic metres. During the construction of the viaduct, the river had to be diverted. The railway line followed the course of the river from Lower Fold, more or less to near its source at Shawforth Moor, thence to Bacup via Britannia.Ordnance Survey Sheets, above Much of its traffic was stone freight, for example from Broadley Stone Sidings, beside the river at Broadley Stone Rubbing Mill. The initial building of the line to Facit was \\"of great service in conveying stone and coal from the quarries and mines in the Whitworth valley to their destination.\\"William Robertson Rochdale and the Valley of Whitworth (Rochdale) 1897 p346 Ilen Associates, above, Industrial Archaeology Guides to Healey Dell; No.2 The Viaduct, No.4, The Stone Rubbing Mill The railway line closed, and the track was taken up,in 1967; the viaduct remains with a footway and the Rochdale to Whitworth sewer pipe over it.Healey Dell Heritage Centre, Healey Dell Trail Guide, above Industrial history - Turner Brothers Asbestos Mills and Works In 1855 one of the original Turner brothers built, in partnership with another, a cotton mill called Clod Mill alongside the river, at Spotland Fold. The firm of Turner Brothers was formed in 1871, and diversified firstly into the manufacture of asbestos packing, then, by 1879, into weaving asbestos yarn and asbestos cloth. It rapidly assumed a national, and later a global, prominence. The Clod Mill site expanded considerably. Later still, the firm manufactured combination products with rubber and asbestos, including clutch and brake linings, leading to the mill complex being described as \\"Asbestos and India Rubber Works\\" in 1910.Ordnance Survey, Lancashire Survey, Sheet LXXX.16, edition of 1910. Wilfrid Ellison Some Notes on the Earlier History and Development to 1939 of Turner Brothers Asbestos Co.

Partial demolition of the works commenced in 2001, though problems continued until 2013.Rochdale Observer newspaper report, 20 February 2013 July Flood, 1838 This term was applied to the effects on the River Spodden and the Spodden Valley of a storm which took place on 4 July 1838. The storm was described as one of the most violent storms ever known in the area, and heavy rain and hail led to the river rising, near to the site of Spotland Bridge, to a height of fifteen feet (4.5m). Spotland Bridge was swept away, together with minor bridges in the area. \\"All the mills and houses near to its banks were much damaged.\\" Mills along the river up to Broadley, including Healey Hall Mills, Foot Mill and Meanwood Die Works, were \\"almost demolished\\". The Fairies Chapel, in Healey Dell, (see below), was also damaged. On the following day, hailstones on Rooley Moor were found, weighing as much as 12 oz (340 g); the hailstorm was so fierce that it broke skylights and windows in houses and weaving sheds. At Moss Mill, Rochdale, the hail was said to have broken one thousand panes of glass.Henry Fishwick The History of the Parish of Rochdale in the County of Lancaster (James Clegg, Rochdale & London) 1889, p536.

Fairies Chapel Another feature of the River Spodden is the Fairies Chapel. Passing through Healey Dell, the river flows through a narrow gorge, called the Thrutch, \\"thrutch being a Lancashire dialect word meaning to push, to press, and to crowd, derived from the Anglo-Saxon \\"thrycan\\".J.H.Nodal & S.Milner A Glossary of the Lancashire Dialect (1875), edition published by the Manchester Literary Club) 1972. Kershaw, above, provides an alternative explanation that the term really relates to the steep incline down to the gorge, p34 Within the gorge, the river waters had carved out a cave to the side of the river, and the rocks there had assumed strange shapes, described as \\"a pulpit, reading desk and seats\\", leading to the area being imagined, and described, as the Fairies Chapel. A woodcut of the Fairies Chapel, in 1854, is reproduced in the Victoria Pictorial History of Lancaster.The Victoria Pictorial History of the County of Lancaster (George Routledge, London) 1854, p167 William Robertson, a local historian writing in 1881, stated; \\"The credulity of the uneducated working class was something amazing...the chief topics at (holiday-time social) meetings was the doing of fairies, who were regarded as real human beings, whose chief business it was to thwart evil designs, and especially protect those whose good the fairies had at heart.\\"William Robertson Old and New Rochdale and Its People (Rochdale) 1881, p47. Ilen Associates, above, Guide No.7; Fairies Chapel. See also Healey Dell Trail Guide (Healey Dell Nature Reserve, Rochdale) 2010. The Fairies Chapel was under the control of the Fairy Queen, who was regarded as having the gift of prophecy. Her most famous prophecy was given to Lady Eleanor Byron, a relative of the poet Lord Byron, when her marriage and widowhood on the same wedding day was foretold. Some parts of the Fairies Chapel were destroyed by the July Flood, 1838. (See above)William Robertson Rochdale and the Vale of Whitworth,above, pp223-225 cited by Ilen Associates, above. Healey Dell Nature Reserve The River Spodden forms the centrepoint of the Healey Dell Nature Reserve. In addition to the river, with the Fairies Chapel, above, the nature reserve contains many species of wild flowers and grasses, with brightly coloured fungi, such as Wax Caps, visible in autumn.

Researchers at the James Cook University gained attention in 2006 after finding and reporting this behavior. Polyrhachis sokolova nests in mud in mangrove swamps, regularly inundated by rising tides. They survive these inundations in pockets of air that are trapped within the nest. This lifestyle calls for regular moving of their eggs, larvae and cocoons to stay ahead of water trickling into the nest passages. A large amount of effort is expended on repairing water damage after each high tide. The ants are able to move across large stretches of water by either running on the surface tension skin or swimming with their legs below the surface. While swimming it has been documented that these ants are eaten by fish, mud skippers, and crabs.

He was medical director of the hospital in Chad's capital, Fort- Lamy (now N'Djamena), in 1963 when he was arrested for plotting against the government of President Fran√ßois Tombalbaye. Condemned to death, his sentence was commuted after a vigorous campaign led by the French Communist Party. He was reprieved in 1965 and was able to resume his medical career. In 1969 Bono was again arrested and condemned to forced labour; but Tombalbaye released him early and appointed him Director (i.e. chief civil servant) of the Chadian Health Ministry, until, in 1972, he left Chad and went to Paris, where he joined the exiled political opposition. He had organised a press conference to launch a new political party, the Mouvement D√©mocratique de R√©novation Tchadienne (MDRT), but two days before, on 26 August 1973, Outel Bono was assassinated in Paris. He was killed by two shots from a revolver as he climbed into his car. The police investigation failed to find the culprit and the file was closed in 1982 by the investigating magistrate. There were suspicions that both the French secret service and the Chadian Government was involved. A journalist identified the killer as a French agent who had previously worked for President Bokassa of the Central African Republic, a certain Jacques Bocquel, possibly through orders from Camille Gourvenec, a French aide of the President Tombalbaye. Outel Bono's French wife, Nadine, tried to have the case reopened but her appeal was rejected and she was forced to pay legal costs. The case of Outel Bono has been cited as an example of the web of secret links between powerful people in France and its former African colonies, for which the author Fran√ßois-Xavier Verschave coined the term Fran√ßafrique in 1994.

He received an education in jurisprudence in Ferrara, but began political activity in his native city, protesting against the bad administration of the Papal legates. He was also a member of the communal and provincial councils between 1844 and 1845. left He soon became a fervent supporter of Mazzini's ideas, and in 1849 took part in the short-lived Roman Republic. Saffi was a member of the government that attempted to establish a democratic republic, inspired by the United States. The revolutionaries, however, were soon (June 1849) crushed by French troops, and Saffi retired to Liguria as an exile. From there he joined Mazzini in Switzerland, and then moved with him to London. Saffi returned to Italy only in 1852, to plan a series of risings to be held in Milan. After the failure of the project in 1853, he fled to England again and was condemned in absentia to twenty years in prison. He was appointed the first teacher of Italian at the Taylor Institute, Oxford, in 1856.Taylor Institution ‚Äì an Introduction , accessed July 30, 2011. While in England he married (1857) Georgiana Janet Craufurd. She was also a fervent supporter of Mazzini, and a feminist. They had four sons: Attilio Joseph (1858 - 1923), Emilio John (1861 - 1930), Charles Balilla Louis (1863 - 1896) and Rinaldo Arthur (1868 - 1929). In 1860, Saffi moved to Naples, again with Mazzini. The following year he was elected a deputy in the Parliament of the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. Some years later he returned to London, where he remained until 1867. He spent his last days in his villa in the Forl√¨ countryside, moving to Bologna where he had received a professorial chair. He also devoted himself to collecting historical material connected to his friend Giuseppe Mazzini. He died at the age of seventy at his residence, Villa Saffi, which is now turned into a museum.

History In the sixteenth century the city belonged to the Kiszka family. In the mid-sixteenth century Castellan of Trakai, Piotr Kiszka built a castle on the right bank of the river Nurzec, northeast of the town. Between 1617‚Äì1642, Miko≈Çaj Kiszka ordered to build heavy defensive walls around the fortress, but soon the castle burned down during the Deluge, and the surviving buildings with the newly built residence for the Ossoli≈Ñski family were later blown up and destroyed by the Imperial Russian Army during World War I (1915). To this day only the foundations and the moat still exist. The forthcoming owners of the city were: The Bremmer, Ossoli≈Ñski, Szczukow and Ciecierski families. In particular, the Ossoli≈Ñski family in the second half of the seventeenth century invested in the development of the city. Paddle boats are a popular tourist attraction In 1736‚Äì1739, a brick church of the Holy Trinity and the Sisters of Mercy hospital was built, according to the draft of Warmia's architect Jan Adrian Kluk. His son, Fr. Jan Krzysztof Kluk (1739‚Äì1796), the local parish priest, devoted to natural history, became one of the most important Polish naturalists of the Enlightenment. He is the author of the first comprehensive textbook in the Polish language on agriculture, as well as other pioneering scientific topics, as well as school textbooks written on request of the Commission of National Education. The scope of the research included both botany and zoology, and natural pharmaceuticals. In the era of the partitions, Ciechanowiec was passed onto Prussia, and after the Congress of Vienna to the Russian Empire. Later the city was divided into two parts: right bank (called New Town or \\"Polish section\\"), was part of the Polish Kingdom and the left bank Old Town (\\"Rus section\\") in Russia. As a result of the November and January Uprisings, the right bank of Ciechanowiec lost the city rights in 1870. At the end of the nineteenth century, the textile industry rapidly developed in the city. Ciechanowiec was also very popular for various horse fairs. Significant damage from the times of World War I and the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War were slowly repaired in the interwar period. Before the beginning of World War II, 55% of the town's inhabitants were Jews. At that time the city was known to a large number of workshops, mainly Jewish. In 1938, the left bank of Ciechanowiec (then located in the district of Bielsko) was attached to the right part of the town (on the status of the settlement), previously located in the district of Wysokomazowieckie (in the municipality of Klukowo). During World War II, the city was badly destroyed, as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, first by the soldiers of the Red Army, and after June 1941 by the German Army. The Jewish population was almost completely exterminated at the Treblinka extermination camp. After the war, reconstruction lasted a long time and the city has not regained its former importance and population that it once had. Jewish family names like Ciechanowiec, Ciechanowiecki, Ciechanowicz, Ciechanowski and Chechanover originated from this town. Geography Ciechanowiec is located in eastern Poland about northeast from Warsaw and around west from the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest in the Territory of Preserved Landscape of the Valley of the Bug and Nurzec Rivers. The Nurzec River divides the town into two parts: the Left Side and the Right Side.  Demography  According to the 1921 census, the village was inhabited by 3.291 people, among whom 1.568 were Roman Catholic, 39 Orthodox, 34 Evangelical and 1.649 Mosaic. At the same time, 1.653 inhabitants declared Polish nationality, 11 Belarusian, 21 German and 1.693 Jewish. There were 361 residential buildings in the village.Skorowidz miejscowo≈õci Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej: opracowany na podstawie wynik√≥w pierwszego powszechnego spisu ludno≈õci z dn. 30 wrze≈õnia 1921 r. i innych ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç urzƒôdowych., t.

Route description NY 433 approaching the junction with NY 22 NY 433 begins at the Connecticut state line in the town of North Castle. A northern, state- maintained continuation of Greenwich's Riversville Road, NY 433 proceeds north through North Castle as North Greenwich Road. NY 433 winds northward through a residential area of North Castle, passing the wooded Johnson Park on the southbound side of the highway. The route winds northward past several intersections with local streets, soon reaching the junction with NY 22 (Armonk-Bedford Road). This junction marks the northern terminus of NY 433, just north of the state line. The right-of-way continues north of NY 22 as Niles Avenue, while just east of this intersection are junctions with NY 128 and I-684 in Armonk. History When NY 128 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it initially ended at NY 22 in Armonk. It was extended southward to the Connecticut state line in the mid-1930s over NY 22 and North Greenwich Road. The extension of NY 128 remained intact until January 1971 when NY 128 was cut back to its original terminus in Armonk.

Objectives of the Hundred Group  The main purpose of The Hundred Group is to provide a forum for discussion and to make contributions and representations on issues of importance for financial management. Members are actively involved to ensure that the views of users and preparers of accounts are fully understood. Submissions are made to Government and other organisations highlighting the practical implications of existing financial procedures, related legislation and proposed changes. The Hundred Group is made up of a Main committee and four sub-committees covering the topics of Financial Reporting, Investor Relations & Markets, Tax and Pensions.  History of The Hundred Group  The group began life as a spin-off from the London Society of Chartered Accountants, predating the launch of the FTSE-100. Originally called the Hundred Group of Chartered Accountants, its most immediate concern was the Labour government's price control policy at a time when inflation was 2% per month. The Hundred Group soon found its feet as a forum for discussion and lobbying. Eventually, membership was widened to include FDs who were not chartered accountants and the affiliation with the London Society of Chartered Accountants was ended. The group became the Hundred Group of Finance Directors, and non-FDs were asked to leave. The Hundred Group is now active at engaging with government, regulators and wider stakeholders and publish all responses to consultations on their website. Most recent responses have included to the CMA on the statutory audit market review and responses to the FRC on the revisions to the Corporate Governance Code.  Membership of the Hundred Group  Participation in the group is by invitation only.

This chub generally follows the cyprinid body plan. Its dorsal fin lies directly over the pelvic fins, and usually has nine rays. Coloration is rather variable; the back is usually a metallic or olive green ranging to nearly black, and sometimes with a bluish shade, while the sides are silvery, brassy, or golden. Males have somewhat more of a golden look, especially during breeding season, often including a narrow golden stripe along the upper side. Fin colors include dull olive, yellow, and golden shades. It has been recorded in Bear Lake at up to 56 cm in length and 1.5 kg weight, but 40 cm is more typical, and in many areas 15‚Äì20 cm is the norm. Utah chubs are omnivorous, consuming both plants and a variety of insects, crustacea, snails, and sometimes small fish or fish eggs. Bathymetric chart of Bear Lake, Utah with chub habitat It lives in a variety of habitats within its range, from irrigation ditches to ponds to large rivers and lakes, preferring areas with dense vegetation. It is also known from alkaline and salty springs found on desert floors. Most seem to frequent depths of a meter or less, but one was caught in Bear Lake at a depth of 25 meters. Spawning occurs during late spring and summer, in shallow water (less than a meter deep). 2-6 males escort each female, and fertilize the eggs she scatters at random on the bottom. The eggs then hatch in about a week, the exact time depending on water temperature. Although easily taken with a hook and line, anglers do not consider it a desirable catch, and often find it a nuisance while going after trout. Wildlife agencies have even tried eradication programs to reduce the numbers, but have had no effect, the chub population bouncing back easily. References External links  William F.

Origins of the ethnonym In 1892, ethnologist John Fraser edited and republished the work of Lancelot Edward Threlkeld on the language of the Awabakal people, An Australian Grammar, with lengthy additions. In his \\"Map of New South Wales as occupied by the native tribes\\" and text accompanying it, he deploys the term Kuringgai to refer to the people inhabiting a large stretch of the central coastline of New South Wales. He regarded the language described by Threlkeld as a dialect of a larger language, variations of which were spoken by many other tribes in New South Wales, and, in order to define this perceived language block he coined the word Kurriggai/Kuringgai: > we have now come to know that this dialect was essentially the same as that > spoken by the sub-tribes occupying the land where Sydney now stands, and > that they all formed parts of one great tribe, the Kuriggai. Fraser lists a number of tribes to the north of his assumed Kuriggai language family: the Gamilaraay and their sub-tribes, the Ualarai and Weilwan. In the text accompanying his map, he states: > The next great tribe is the Kuringgai on the sea coast. Their taurai > (hunting ground or territory) is known to extend north to the Macleay River, > and I found that southwards it reached the Hawkesbury. then after, by > examining the remains of the language of the natives about Sydney and > southwards, and by other tests, I assured myself that the country thereabout > was occupied by sub-tribes of the Kurringgai. Fraser's 1892 map. Kuringgai is marked VIII. Norman Tindale, in his 1974 classic survey of all known Australian tribes, was dismissive of Fraser's conjecture as \\"poor\\" in details, and \\"unquestionably the most inaccurate and garbled account ever published about the aborigines. Many of his tribal names were pure artifacts\\", each created to subsume under an invented label several different tribal identities: thus his fantasy of a Paikalyung crushed together 10 tribal units; his Yunggai nation throws together the Anƒìwan, Jukambal and the Kwiambal; his Wachigaru dissolves into one fictional unity the Banbai, Gumbaynggirr, Ngaku and some of the Dunghutti. Even his acknowledgement of the Ualarai actually sweeps up 5 distinct aboriginal societies. Under his heading for the Awabakal, he writes: > the Awabakal are the central one of a series of tribes to which the > arbitrary term Kuringgai has been applied by Fraser. Where Fraser discerned one \\"nation\\", Tindale defined a conglomeration of distinct tribes such as the Tharawal, Eora, Dharuk, Darkinjang, Awabakal, Worimi, Wonnarua, Birpai and Ngamba. Arthur Capell, writing four years earlier, thought to the contrary that Kuringgai/Guri≈ãgai denoted some substantive historical reality, and was an appropriate name for the language spoken on the north side of Port Jackson northwards at least as far as Tuggerah Lakes. He concluded under the heading Karee/Kuringgai' that the reference is to:- > the language of the Pittwater people, and included the well-known > Cammeraygal on the extreme south, along the northern shores of Port Jackson, > and stretched as far north at least as Broken Bay. This is the basis for the > statement above that the \\"Sydney\\" language did not cross Port Jackson Val Attenbrow dismissed Capell's claim for an independent Guri≈ãgai, while Amanda Lissarrague and Jim Wafer reanalyzed the material and concluded the word denoted the \\"Hunter River-Lake Macquarie language\\", otherwise known as Awabakal.

Founded in 1883 as the oldest girls' senior school in Sunderland, it merged with a local boys' school to become the current coeducational school. A junior school was later added and is located on a separate site nearby. It is owned by the United Church Schools Trust. The school closed at the end of the 2016 Summer term. History The original Sunderland High School was founded in 1883 by the Rector of Bishopwearmouth, Robert Long. Prior to going coeducational, it was the oldest girls' school in the city. After gaining support from local townsfolk as well as the mayor, the school opened in April 1884 with just 16 full-time pupils at 10-11 Park Terrace, now Toward Road. After World War II, the school continued to grow and expand. In 1987, the school celebrated its 100-year heritage by opening the Centenary Building which housed the school's ICT suites. The sixth form became coeducational and boys were first admitted into the school in 1988. In 1992, it merged with Tonstall School, a long-established boys' day school to become a fully coeducational independent day school. A major programme began at Hendon Hill to build Tonstall House in order to provide a new Junior School and sports hall for the whole school. It was officially opened by The Princess Royal. The school was praised in the 2005 Independent Schools Inspectorate report, notably for its pastoral care and the quality of its extracurricular provision. The Senior School, Junior School and Nursery all gained national quality awards. In March 2006 it was - according to the national awarding body, BECTA - \\"one of the first schools in the country to achieve the BECTA ICT Mark\\". The Junior School was the first school in the country to be awarded the Investors in People Leadership and Management Award. On 18 January 2016 it was announced that the whole school would be closing at the end of the current academic year due to dropping enrolment and six figure losses. Academics In 2009 the school's A Level results were the best in the city with 63% of all entries at A or B grade. Buildings The senior school comprised five main buildings including Main School (the original building), Centenary Building, Clifton Hall, Carlton House and Langham Tower. The purpose-built junior school was close by. Pupils from all parts of the school shared the sports facilities which included a sports hall and all-weather pitch. *Main School - Purpose built in 1886-8, it had many of the original features of the time. It housed the large main assembly hall, form rooms, English, Art and the school's main library. The use of this building was transferred to the newer ones. This site also housed the History, Design Technology and Food and Nutrition departments, as well as a canteen. *Carlton House - The oldest of all the buildings. Formerly Nicholson House, built in 1851 for William Nicholson, who ran a highly successful copper and ships‚Äô metalware business. Main School and Langham Tower were both built in the grounds of this building. It housed the VI Form common room, VI Form ICT facilities and independent study rooms. It boasts a grand staircase. *Centenary building - Built for the school's centenary (1984), it housed the science labs, well equipped and of suitable size. Also situated there was the Business Studies Department, main ICT facilities and the Geography Department. This building is unusual from the outside, shaped in a large arch, with a road leading to the car park. *Clifton Hall - Originally two pairs of semi-detached villas, joined together in a conversion to a training college in a design by the local authority‚Äôs education architect Oliver Hall Mark in 1933. It had teaching facilities on the ground floor and residential accommodation above. When the school acquired this building in 2000, the First floor was totally redesigned. The Basement and Second floors are out of bounds and unused. The second floor, in fact was separated into dormitory rooms, some still complete with wardrobes, sinks and period carpets. Clifton Hall was a pastoral base for Year 7 and Year 8. It accommodated Year 7 and 8 form rooms, the Mathematics Department and music and drama facilities. This site also encompassed the nearby Bede gym, formally a university canteen, used for health related fitness. The design of the gym meant that major indoor sports took place in the school's large sports hall on the junior school site. Precisely when the original Clifton Villas went up is not known. However, according to research by planner John Tumman, the estate owner Anthony John Moore, solicitor, water company chairman and mayor, lived next door in Bede Tower from 1852, and is known to have had grandiose plans for villas there as part of the estate development which included grand terraces like Park Place, St Bede‚Äôs Terrace, Douro Terrace, and Mowbray Villas and Carlton Villas. Clifton Villas were certainly in existence by 1880, when the tenant at No 1 was John Tillman, who with his brother Thomas, designed Sunderland Museum. Nearby Bede Tower, Moore's Italianate home, was formerly part of the University of Sunderland. It housed the school's examination hall. The school also used the large auditorium in this building for theatrical performances. *Langham Tower - Most recently acquired by the school, Grade II listed and by far the most attractive of the school's buildings. It was opened by former pupil Kate Adie in 2007. Built in the grounds of Carlton House, it boasts a large and beautiful main staircase with large stained glass windows. It was designed by renowned architect William Milburn, built in 1889-1891, for William Adamson, trader in ships' provisions and oil, and son of the well- known shipbuilder who lived in Fawcett Street. Later Langham Tower was occupied by Major Cuthbert Vaux, of Vaux Breweries, and later by Robert Thompson (1850‚Äì1908), Shipbuilder. Later it housed Sunderland College of Education, a teacher training college. It housed the Modern Languages Department, Religious Studies, P.E. Theory, Media Studies and a Sixth Form Study, as well as a number of offices. *Junior School - Built a little way from the main school site in 1994 next to the previous building with the same function. This large building housed the entire Junior school and all of their facilities, with a large assembly hall and a very large sports hall. The Second floor, originally unused, was refurbished and some classrooms were added. The sports hall, sports field and all-weather pitch was shared with the senior school for PE lessons. The sports hall was also used for the annual Speech Day.

SQL is primarily intended for manipulating relations (also known as tables), which are finite bags of tuples (rows). StreamSQL adds the ability to manipulate streams, which are infinite sequences of tuples that are not all available at the same time. Because streams are infinite, operations over streams must be monotonic. Queries over streams are generally \\"continuous\\", executing for long periods of time and returning incremental results. The StreamSQL language is typically used in the context of a Data Stream Management System (DSMS), for applications including algorithmic trading, market data analytics, network monitoring, surveillance, e-fraud detection and prevention, clickstream analytics and real-time compliance (anti-money laundering, RegNMS, MiFID). Other streaming and continuous variants of SQL include StreamSQL.io, Kafka KSQL, SQLStreamBuilder, WSO2 Stream Processor, SQLStreams, SamzaSQL, and Storm SQL.  Technical details  StreamSQL extends the type system of SQL to support streams in addition to tables. Several new operations are introduced to manipulate streams. Selecting from a stream - A standard \`SELECT\` statement can be issued against a stream to calculate functions (using the target list) or filter out unwanted tuples (using a \`WHERE\` clause). The result will be a new stream. Stream-Relation Join - A stream can be joined with a relation to produce a new stream. Each tuple on the stream is joined with the current value of the relation based on a predicate to produce 0 or more tuples. Union and Merge - Two or more streams can be combined by unioning or merging them. Unioning combines tuples in strict FIFO order. Merging is more deterministic, combining streams according to a sort key. Windowing and Aggregation - A stream can be windowed to create finite sets of tuples. For example, a window of size 5 minutes would contain all the tuples in a given 5 minute period. Window definitions can allow complex selections of messages, based on tuple field values. Once a finite batch of tuples is created, analytics such as count, average, max, etc., can be applied. Windowing and Joining - A pair of streams can also be windowed and then joined together. Tuples within the join windows will combine to create resulting tuples if they fulfill the predicate.  History  StreamSQL is derived from academic research into Event Stream Processing, closely related to complex event processing. Led by Michael Stonebraker, a team of 30 professors and students on project Aurora worked collaboratively from 2001 through 2003 to develop the core principles behind StreamSQL. The Aurora project was superseded by the Borealis project. Borealis is a distributed multi-processor version of Aurora.

He was one of the strongest advocates for a Swedish nuclear weapons program. He worked hard to convince the government that they were necessary. Career Swedlund was born on 16 May 1898 in G√§vle, Sweden, the son of major Gustav Swedlund and his wife Ellen (n√©e Reuterski√∂ld) and brother of the archivist and historian Robert Swedlund. He passed studentexamen at the H√∂gre allm√§nna l√§roverket in G√§vle in 1917 and became a second lieutenant in H√§lsinge Regiment (I 14) in 1919. Swedlund became captain in the General Staff Corps in 1933 and conducted rehearsals and was a teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1934 to 1938 and from 1940 to 1942. He was promoted to major in 1940 and lieutenant colonel in 1942. Swedlund was head of department at the Defence Staff in 1942 and was appointed vice chief and section chief in the Defense Staff in 1944. He was promoted to colonel the same year. During World War II Swedlund was involved in the Swedish training of Norwegian police troops. Swedlund was then commanding officer of Norrbotten Regiment (I 19) from 1946 to 1947 and the Chief of the Defence Staff from 1947 to 1951. He was promoted to major general in 1948, lieutenant general in 1951 and finally general in 1951. Swedlund was the Supreme Commander from 1951 to 1961. As Supreme Commander Swedlund was a strong supporter of nuclear weapons and a driving force in continuing the Swedish nuclear weapons program. He regarded them as necessary for the Swedish defence and worked hard to gain the government's support on the issue. He was also involved in the secret operations for the formation of a Swedish resistance movement in the event of a Soviet invasion, the so-called Stay-behind movement. Personal life On 14 April 1927 in Halmstad, Swedlund married Brita Alexandra Broberg (26 November 1901 in Eftra, Halland ‚Äì 17 July 1993 in Danderyd), the daughter of major Carl Alfred Broberg and Ebba Susanna St√•hle.

It is the first title in the Shantae series. The game follows the adventures of the eponymous half- genie Shantae, who must travel across Sequin Land, the setting of the series, to foil the domination plans of the evil lady pirate Risky Boots. During her quest, she learns various dances and acquires items which make her progressively stronger as well as unlocking new abilities and locations, leading her to ultimately face off against Risky in her hideout. The game became obscure due to its release coming a year after that of the Game Boy Advance. However, it received favorable reviews and has garnered recognition since its release, being included on multiple lists of best games on the platform, and being called a \\"cult classic\\" by some reviewers. A port for Nintendo Switch is scheduled for a 2020 release. Gameplay The player character, Shantae, traverses a forest area. Shantae is a platform-adventure game, in which players play as the eponymous Shantae, a half-genie who must travel across various areas in order to stop the evil lady pirate Risky Boots. Shantae's default attack involves using her hair like a whip. Shantae can also use gems obtained from defeated enemies to purchase items, such as life- restoring potions and damaging items with various uses, as well as learn upgraded combat moves. The game features five towns, with various areas filled with enemies and obstacles in between them. In order to progress through the game, Shantae must seek out various characters who will open up dungeons, with each dungeon containing a guardian genie that will teach Shantae a new dance. By using these dances, Shantae can transform herself into different animals, including a monkey that can climb on walls, an elephant that can smash objects such as boulders and tree stumps, a spider that can climb across webbing in the background, and a harpy that can fly in mid-air. Shantae must use these abilities to reach new areas or find hidden items. The game features a day and night cycle, with enemies becoming stronger during the night. During nighttime, players can collect hidden fireflies, with a reward available for collecting them all. Other collectible creatures include Warp Squids, which are squid-shaped items hidden within dungeons, and which can be given to larger mother squids in each town in exchange for the ability to instantly warp there. Finally, heart vessels can be obtained to increase Shantae's maximum health. The game also features various minigames, such as dancing or gambling, in order to earn additional gems. Synopsis Setting and characters The game takes place in a fictional setting called Sequin Land, described as a magical place, formerly protected by Guardian Genies who won the land years of peace. With time, genies fell in love with humans and had children with them, half-genies with limited magical powers. For obscure reasons, genies ultimately vanished, with their children taking their place as protectors of the land. The main character, Shantae, is one such half-genie, appointed as the Guardian Genie of the small fishing village of Scuttle Town, where she resides in the abandoned lighthouse. The game features a small cast of recurring characters, including the main character, described as \\"innocent and somewhat na√Øve,[...] with a childlike view of right and wrong\\", although she's also determined and skilled at fighting. Other characters include the antagonist, Risky Boots, self appointed \\"Queen of the Seven Seas\\", who reigns over a silent pirate crew of creatures called \\"Tinkerbats\\" who are bound to her will; Uncle Mimic, an aged member of a congregation of adventurers called the Relic Hunters who acts as a surrogate parent figure to Shantae; Bolo, Shantae's sparring partner who happens to be somewhat air-headed and submissive to women; Sky, Shantae's lifelong friend who raises and trains war birds, and is always shown with her pet war bird Wrench; and the zombie Rottytops, who is described as friendly, but mischievous and untrustworthy. Plot A gang of pirates, the Tinkerbats, led by Risky Boots, attacks Scuttle Town and steals a prototype steam engine from Mimic, the town's resident treasure hunter. Mimic tells Shantae, the guardian of Scuttle Town, that if Risky retrieves four magical \\"elemental stones\\", she could power up the steam engine and create an unstoppable weapon out of it. Shantae travels across Sequin Land, determined to retrieve the steam engine and the elemental stones and stop Risky. With help from her friends Bolo and Sky and her acquaintance Rottytops, she gains access to three dungeons where she retrieves three of the stones. At the fourth dungeon, Shantae finds the fourth stone, but is ambushed at the exit by Risky, who leaves with the stones. Shantae subsequently discovers the location of Risky's hideout with a magical flying telescope called the Spy Scope, and teleports there. Shantae reaches and destroys Risky's weapon, the Tinker Tank. Risky tries to kill Shantae but is defeated; and as Risky's hideout collapses, Shantae escapes. After, she is magically abducted to a place called the Genie Realm where the genies offer her a chance to remain with them as a reward for her courage, but at the price of never seeing her friends again. She refuses and is sent back to Scuttle Town where she announces to Mimic that she had to destroy the steam engine, but is relieved to hear from him that it was probably for the better. Development Game development The game was considered for development by WayForward as far back as 1997. An archived version of the company's official website showcases a very different approach to the game, which was at the time considered for development on PC or PlayStation, in full 3D with traditionally animated characters moving before a 3D background. Shantae was presented as a troubled genie born without magic powers, who had to save the world from the Jins, powerful beings once sealed who escaped at the beginning of the game and planned to drain all magic from the world. Back then, her magic was capable, as envisioned by Erin Bozon, the original creator of the character, to summon animals, but transformation was already planned as Shantae could turn into a harpy. Her dances could also launch attacks and she had different outfits with different characteristics. In the idea of Matt Bozon, who created the game's universe based on Erin's character, at the beginning, the game was planned for the SNES or PC. He and Erin pitched the game with help from veteran programmer Jimmy Huey, who worked with WayForward at the time. After the completion of Xtreme Sports, Voldi Way, the founder and owner of WayForward, greenlit a Game Boy Color version of the game. As Huey had already built a graphics engine for Xtreme Sports, this engine was adapted to suit Shantae's needs. This allowed the game to showcase rare effects on GBC games, like parallax scrolling and transparency effects. In the first four months of development, the team created most of the animation, and Huey programmed an art-capturing tool that allowed to take full-colored animation frames, turn them into three-color chunks and reassemble the whole on the GBC's screen. Publishing The game needed a 32 megabit battery backed-up cartridge to work properly, and was expensive to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside the fact that launching a new intellectual property was considered dicey. WayForward tried to find a publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20‚Äì25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen had a tendency to darken the colors, so they took back the game and made further developments on it, incorporating a feature to brighten the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features. Music In 2000, the sound was developed using the Musyx audio format, but WayForward chose to switch during development. The soundtrack featured about 20 songs at the time, and was composed by Jake Kaufman. Kaufman ultimately used the Paragon 5 GameBoy Tracker to create the music. Paragon 5's CEO, Paul Bragiel, served as music producer, and Stephane Hockenhull performed music replay. The soundtrack to the game was released in January 2019 by Fangamer in a red vinyl format, with a limited edition purple variant published by Limited Run Games. Reception Sales and analysis Precise sales figures for the game have not been made public, but according to Bozon, it sold poorly; he said that he had heard that 20‚Äì25,000 copies of the game were produced, which did sell out, but that a second print run did not get made. Matt Bozon has refused to blame Capcom, the publisher of the game, for responsibility in the game's failure. This was despite Capcom holding it for 8 months after completion, with the game finally releasing when the Game Boy Advance was already in its first year of existence. He says he went in \\"very naive\\", believing that if the game was good, it would sell anyway. Bozon believed that from a creative standpoint, he never really settled on a target audience, with the character being \\"iconoclastic\\", \\"too sexy to be a kid's brand, and too girly for a male gamer brand\\". Also, before the game was even released, Bozon claims that he had come to understand anyway that the game \\"would probably not sell\\", as during WayForward's search for a publisher, many market analysts were skeptical at the idea of having a female lead character, and Bozon ultimately acknowledged that they probably \\"genuinely knew their markets\\". He still did not give up, as he felt that Shantae had to exist, \\"even if it was just to reach out and see if there was an audience reaching back.\\" Critical reception Shantae was generally well received by contemporaneous critics. IGN called it a \\"wonderful platform adventure\\", with \\"tons of variety in its level and character design\\", adding that it \\"looks fantastic as a Game Boy Color game\\". GameSpot claimed it to be a \\"fine example\\" of a portable platformer, \\"firmly rooted in the traditional conventions of the [platform game] genre\\", and added that \\"one area that this game truly shines in is the animation\\", although they complained about the music being \\"simple\\" and \\"repetitive\\", with \\"bland\\" sound effects. However, Andy McNamara for Game Informer was less positive, saying \\"the game just isn't compelling enough to keep you playing.\\" Retrospective reviews were positive as well, with Kaes Delgrego and Corbie Dillard of Nintendo Life and Kyle MacGregor of Destructoid claiming the game to be a \\"cult classic\\". Delgrego added that it was a \\"love-letter to the side-scrolling epic adventures of the NES\\". He added that the graphics and sound are \\"outstanding\\", although acknowledged some issues with the tiny screen of the Game Boy and overall lack of guidance in-game. Delgrego concluded by saying the game \\"does proper justice to the golden era of gaming\\". A new 2013 review for the re-release of the game on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console by Mike Mason claimed that the \\"2D platformer is sprinkled with enough genie-magic to keep it fresh and interesting for a modern audience.\\" Shantae was nominated in several lists of the best Game Boy games. Game Informers Ben Reeves called Shantae the 15th best Game Boy game and felt that it was overlooked. Complex named it the 7th best GBC game in 2013, calling it a \\"solid platformer\\". GamesRadar ranked it as the 8th best Game Boy game, saying that \\"Shantae's filled with typical 2D platformer stuff [...] but it‚Äôs all done remarkably well and with a visual flair the GBC rarely saw\\". In 2018, the game was ranked as the 9th best GB/GBC game by French website Jeuxvideo.com, calling it an \\"excellent action- platforming game with superb art direction\\". Sequels Several plans for a Shantae sequel were made, including Shantae: Risky Revolution for the Game Boy Advance, or Shantae: Risky Waters for the Nintendo DS. On September 15, 2009, a sequel titled Shantae: Risky's Revenge was announced, and revealed as a downloadable DSiWare title on Nintendo of America's 2009 Holiday lineup, with a tentative 2009 Q4 release date. Details on the 3-part episodic sequels were revealed in the November 2009 issue of Nintendo Power. However, plans for the episodic release were cancelled, and the game was instead released as a stand- alone sequel for a title to be available on DSiWare on October 4, 2010. The game was later ported to iOS, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4. A third game, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, was released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop on October 23, 2014. Later the game was also released on Wii U, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Amazon Fire TV. A fourth title, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch; it is the first HD game in the series. The game was successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter and PayPal, receiving nearly $950,000, more than doubling its initial goal. A fifth game, Shantae and the Seven Sirens, was released for Apple Arcade in 2019, and for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in 2020. Re- releases Shantae was digitally re-released by WayForward via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on July 18, 2013. The game is available via eShop in North America and for the first time in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In July 2020, Limited Run Games announced they would be producing a brief run of new Shantae cartridges for Game Boy Color, with pre-orders scheduled to begin the following September. WayForward also announced that they would be releasing a port of the game for Nintendo Switch, both digitally and as a limited physical release from Limited Run.

Doorway to Jericho), founded in 1999, is an Israeli settlement and a community settlement located in the West Bank's southern Jordan Valley just north of Jericho, in the Yitav Valley. The site is 150m below sea level. It falls under the municipal jurisdiction of the Bik'at HaYarden Regional Council. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. On September 15, 2019, the Israeli government officially approved the establishment of the settlement, making it the sixth new official settlement since the Oslo accords. History Founded as a station for agricultural experiments known as Havat HaIklum (lit. \\"The acclimatization farm\\"), Mevo'ot Yericho became a farming community in 2000. Over the years more families joined and many of them are not involved in agriculture. The total number of families has gone up from a single family to 28 today. Several crops are grown including lemons, dates, figs, grapes, sweet potatoes, passion fruit and more. In the mid-2000s, a project for disadvantaged girls was established at Mevo'ot Yericho. The girls live and work in the community and travel to Jerusalem for studies in the evening. This project is named Ginat Eden http://ginateden.com/ () and continues to grow and help these girls every day. Mikveh Mikveh in Mevo'ot YerichoThe construction of what may be the world's first solar-powered mikveh was completed in 2007. The mikveh is in constant use, including a side opening for the purification of utensils. New neighborhood Over the last few years the community has gone through a process of shifting from temporary housing to permanent structures. Several families have moved into the new houses located above and behind the old community center. Archaeology  Numerous archaeological findings in the area attest to the presence of ancient Jewish settlement. Within the settlement remains of an aqueduct are clearly visible. Remains of this aqueduct run both north and south of the community and can be traced almost all the way from the nearby spring to the area of the ancient synagogue. Both the aqueduct and nearby Na'aran synagogue are dated to the 6th century. Archaeologists believe that these are the remains of a thriving Jewish community that existed in this area at that time.

The Hayes Smartmodem 300, introduced in 1981, helped kill off Novation and many other early modem companies over the next few years.  The Original CAT  Novation's first CAT was an external 300 bit/s Bell 103-standard modem that connected to the phone lines using an acoustic coupler. Like most other acoustically coupled modems, the CAT required the user to dial the desired number on a normal telephone, listening to the call connecting and the eventual presence of a carrier signal. If the dialling was successful, the user then pressed the handset down into rubber cups on the modem to connect. This was only possible because telephones were generally available only from Western Electric, all of a standardized size and layout. There was no sort of automated operation available; even hanging up had to be done manually by returning the handset to the telephone and thereby pressing the hook button.  The Apple-CAT II  The Apple-CAT II modem, along with Com-Ware II software and Advanced Programming Information manual. Novation also introduced an internal direct-connect modem, the Apple-CAT II, which plugged into an expansion slot in an Apple II computer. Due to the internal connection, the APPLE-CAT II was able to feature a full range of dialing commands, and could report a wide range of call progress tones (BUSY, REORDER, etc.) that many modems still lack today. These operations were handled directly by software on the host computer; the modem set certain registers when tones were heard on the line, and by timing when these registers were set or cleared, the software could determine what was happening on the line. The Apple-CAT II also supported the Bell 202 protocol, which allowed half-duplex 1200 bit/s operation when connecting to another Apple-CAT II modem. This was an exceptionally rare feature; modems with \\"full\\" 1200 bit/s operation were expensive devices intended to be used with minicomputers and mainframes, and typically cost thousands of dollars. Since the 1200 bit/s mode was half-duplex, or one-way only, the users would normally have to decide in advance which direction transmissions would proceed. However, software was used to work around this limitation as well. File transfer programs are written specifically for the Apple-CAT II's 202 mode, such as Catsend and the later CatFur, periodically paused and reversed transmission direction, so the receiving computer could acknowledge receipt of a stream of data, and, in the case of CatFur, could add a short chat message to the sender in the middle of the one-way file transfer. Many bulletin board systems (BBSs) running CatSend and then CatFur were set up to transfer warez. The 202 CatFur protocol could only be used by a user running another APPLE-CAT II. In addition, the APPLE- CAT II had the ability to support CCITT v.21 and CCITT v.23, the European standards for 300 and 300/1200 baud operation (as opposed to the normal Bell 103/202 versions). Though no known applications took advantage of this facility, it was possible to modify certain software such as ASCII Express by use of a hex editor to take advantage of this feature. The Apple-CAT II 'Expansion Pack' Novation also released a full-duplex Bell 212-compatible expansion board known as the Novation 212 Expansion Card, which plugged into the Apple II motherboard as well as an existing APPLE-CAT II via a ribbon cable. The card was very expensive and rarely seen. Novation also created an 'Expansion Pack' or external breakout box that would connect to the large pin header on the top middle of the card. This item allowed easy external access to the built-in serial port, phone line and handset connections. Due to its cost at the time, the item is very rare. The APPLE-CAT II was popular with phone phreakers for its high half-duplex 1200 bit/s speed and its ability to detect various tones. It also had the ability to generate tones directly into the phone line. Several specialized applications such as TSPS, The Cats Meow and Phantom Access were used to mimic standard telephone sounds such as standard numeric DTMF dial tones as well as blue box tones, ringing (both American and International), dial tones, call waiting alerts, busy signals, 2600 Hz tones, and other effects such as payphone sounds. Due to these and other features, the APPLE CAT II could be used as a black box, red box, hacking tool, answering machine, war dialer, voice simulator, voice distorter, etc. BYTE criticized Novation, stating that \\"the company's literature should be very explicit\\" about the modem's inability to communicate at 1200 baud with Bell 212 modems without the expansion card, but concluded that \\"Apple users shopping for a modem would be wise to consider this system very carefully\\". Despite the APPLE-CAT II's popularity, its early years were faced with incompatibility with most telecommunications programs, as its native API is considered proprietary by today's standards. To increase compatibility without re-coding these programs, Novation released a firmware upgrade kit (an EPROM package) allowing the modem to emulate the Hayes Micromodem II, including the MMII's IN#x control codes. At the APPLE-CAT II's peak, compatibility with its native API increased, and MMII emulation became less of a necessity.  The D-CAT  A direct-connect version of the original 300 bit/s external modem was later released as the D-CAT. The \\"D\\" stood for \\"direct\\": the modem was directly connected into the handset jack of the telephone instead of requiring acoustic coupling. To operate the D-CAT, a number was dialed on the telephone and the user waited for a carrier signal from the modem being called, just as with an acoustic modem. When a carrier signal was received, a button was pressed on the D-CAT which made it produce a carrier signal and establish a connection with the modem being called, then the handset would be left off- hook. A further improvement was the Auto-CAT, which allowed dialing the phone by entering the number when the modem was first started. Once the connection was made, the modem switched to \\"data mode\\", and from then on had to be operated manually.  The J-CAT  The J-CAT was Novation's first attempt to make a \\"smart modem\\", albeit in a rather non-standard fashion. Its most basic feature was that J-CAT could be placed in a mode where it would automatically pick up the phone if it was called, offering rudimentary auto-answer capability. In an era when it could be safely assumed that the remote user would hang up when they were finished their call, as they were likely using an acoustic coupler modem like the original CAT, the lack of a \\"hang up my phone\\" command was not a real problem. This made the J-CAT useful for BBS use; Novation ran a simple one to allow users to test their new modems. The J-CAT also supported another non-standard feature that allowed direct control of the phone line. Instead of using in-band signalling, like the Smartmodem, the J-CAT passed the on/off-hook control, carrier detect and phone status indication to the computer through otherwise unused pins in the RS-232C connector. The computer could pulse the hook line to simulate pulse dialing or hang up, and read the status pin to look for line signals like ringing or busy (any noise on the line was reported as \\"1\\"). Using these features required a computer able to signal on spare pins, often requiring a second connector and a custom cable to support it. Combined with proper software this made the J-CAT fairly \\"smart\\", although Novation was careful to state it was not a \\"smart modem\\". Operation was generally similar to the APPLE-CAT in concept. The J-CAT was released after the Smartmodem 300, so it was never very popular even though it was fairly low-cost (for the era).  The AutoCat and 212 AutoCat  The AutoCat series consisted of the AutoCat and 212 AutoCat, which were direct-connect modems with auto-answer capabilities.  The Smart-CAT 103 & Smart-CAT 103-212  Novation eventually introduced their own standard smart modems, the Smart-CAT 103 and Smart-CAT 103-212. As the names imply, the later included 1200 bit/s Bell 212 operation in addition to 300 bit/s Bell 103. The later was also offered as the 212 Apple-CAT II, as an internal modem. These models had little to distinguish themselves from other Smartmodem clones, and Novation appears to have disappeared in the early 1980s.

It is used to play music in the tradition of the quattro province, an area of mountains and valleys in the north-west Italian Apennines which includes parts of the four provinces of Alessandria, Genoa, Piacenza and Pavia. It is also played throughout Southern Italy with different fingering styles dictated by local tradition. The instrument is a descendant of the Medieval shawm and belongs to the family of the bombarde. Mouthpiece (ital. musotto) The reed used by the piffero is inserted in a conical brass tube, which is itself inserted in a pirouette. This peculiarity, which is shared with oriental and ancient oboes, is unique in Italy. The piffero has eight tone holes, one of which, on the back of the instrument, is usually covered by the left hand thumb, and ends with a bell, where a cock tail feather (used to clean the reed) typically rests during execution. Traditionally in Northern Italy it was accompanied by an Appennine bagpipe known as the m√ºsa. In the early 20th century the m√ºsa was largely displaced by the accordion, which musicians found in some ways more versatile. However towards the end of the twentieth century the bagpipes made a comeback and today the piffero is commonly accompanied by either of these instruments, or by both. Other regional names for the piffero in Southern Italy are \\"ciaramella\\" or \\"pipita\\". It is still commonly played in accompaniment with the Southern Italian Zampogna, an instrument which itself is essentially a series of pifferos stuck into a common stock and supplied with air through the use of a goat skin bag. Related to the piffero is a larger Sicilian instrument known as the bifora, or pifara. Other uses of the term piffero Piffero is sometimes used as the name of an organ stop which emulates the sound of members of the shawm family;According to Carlo Locher, Manuale dell'organista, Milano, Cisalpino-Goliardica, 1987, p. 127, it is a two-rank (4' and 2') flute stop. while Piffaro (or: Fiffaro)Corrado Moretti, L'organo italiano, 2nd ed., Milano, Casa Musicale Eco, 1973, p. 337 is the name of an organ stop, also known as Voce Umana, whose sound resembles a vibrato transverse flute. The Italian word piffero can also refer to the fife, as in Michael Haydn's Symphony in C major, Perger 10 (Sherman, MH 188, Symphony No. 18), which calls for pifferi. Piffaro is also the name of a performing group specializing in Renaissance music.Piffaro's web site Notes External links * Construction of the instrument and famous builders (in Italian) * Homepage of Ettore Losini * Playing a Piffero (video) * Playing a Piffero (video) Category:Italian musical instruments Category:Single oboes with conical bore ","title":"Piffero"},{"id":"4499997","text":"Monckton's Gazeka, also called the Papuan Devil-Pig is an animal said to have been seen on Papua New Guinea in the early 20th century.

They are the courts of first instance for most criminal cases except for the most serious crimes, and for civil cases where the value of the claim is below a fixed monetary limit. Divisions and districts South Africa is divided into magisterial districts, each of which is served by a district magistrate's court and in some cases also branch courts or periodical courts. Districts are grouped together into regional divisions served by a regional court, which hears more serious cases. At present there is one regional division established for each province, and the regional court sits at multiple locations throughout the province. there were 384 districts (and thus 384 district courts), 18 subdistricts with detached courts, 79 branch courts and 235 periodical courts. There were 1,914 magistrates including 351 regional court magistrates. Jurisdiction In criminal matters a district court has jurisdiction over all offences except treason, murder and rape, and a regional court has jurisdiction over all offences except treason. A district court can impose a fine of not more than R120,000 or a prison sentence of not more than three years, while a regional court can impose a fine of not more than R600,000 or a prison sentence of not more than 15 years, except that for certain offences a regional court can also impose a life sentence. In civil matters a district court has jurisdiction where the value of the claim is R200,000 or less, while a regional court has jurisdiction where the value of the claim is between R200,000 and R400,000. A regional court also has jurisdiction over divorce and related family law matters. Cases in which no magistrate's court has jurisdiction must be brought before the High Court, which has the inherent jurisdiction to hear any case. The High Court also hears appeals from the magistrates' courts, and cases in which the constitutionality of any law or conduct of the President is brought into question.

A local development framework is the spatial planning strategy introduced in England and Wales by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and given detail in Planning Policy Statements 12. In most parts of the two countries, maintaining the framework is the responsibility of English district councils and Welsh principal area councils. Background Planning Policy Statement 12: Creating Strong Safe and Prosperous Communities through Local Spatial Planning (commonly abbreviated as PPS 12), is a document produced by the British Government that sets out the Government's policy on the preparation of local development documents which will comprise the local development framework. The current version was introduced in June 2008 and replaces the original PPS 12: Local Development Frameworks which was produced in 2004. The local development framework replaces the previous system of county level structure plans and district level local plans, and unitary development plans for unitary authorities. The previous system was perceived as being too inflexible and difficult to change in a timely manner. The local development framework system is intended to improve this situation by replacing the old plans with a new portfolio of local development documents that can be tailored to suit the different needs of a particular area and can be easily updated. The frameworks were prepared within a regional spatial strategy (RSS) prepared for each region by the Secretary of State (specifically the Deputy Prime Minister). Local development frameworks were required to have regard to the RSS until they were abolished in 2010. All PPS were replaced by the National Planning Policy Framework in 2012. Chapter 3 sets out the requirements for plan-making. Composition The local development documents taken as a whole must set out the authority's policies relating to the development and use of land in their area. In the case of LDDs included in a minerals and waste development scheme, the LDDs together must also set out the authority's policies relating to minerals and waste development. Each framework will be a folder containing a number of inter-related documents. The Core Strategy, development plan documents and statement of community involvement are compulsory, with other documents being optional. Local development scheme This is a public 'project plan' which identify which local development documents will be produced, in what order and when. The local development scheme acts as the starting point for the community and stakeholders to find out about the local authority's planning policies in respect to a particular place or issue, and what the status of those policies is. It also outlines the details of, and timetable for the production of all documents that make up the local development framework over a three-year period. All local authorities submitted their local development schemes to the Secretary of State by the end of March 2005 Development plan documents These include the Core Strategy Document and the Local Plan. Statement of community involvement The SCI should explain to the public how they will be involved in the preparation of the framework.East Riding of Yorkshire Council https://www.eastriding.gov.uk/planning-permission-and-building- control/planning-policy-and-the-local-plan/statement-of-community-involvement/ They should set out the standards to be met by the authority in terms of community involvement, building upon the minimum requirements set out in the Regulations and PPS 12. Prior to the statement being adopted, local authorities must ensure that any plan preparation work meets these minimum requirements. A key outcome of the SCI will be to encourage 'front loading' meaning that consultation with the public begins at the earliest stages of each document's development so that communities are given the fullest opportunity to participate in plan making and to make a difference. Annual monitoring report The Annual Monitoring ReportOxford City Council https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20067/planning_policy/746/annual_monitoring_report is submitted to Government by a local planning authority at the end of December each year to assess the progress and the effectiveness of a Local Development Framework, specifically: * Are policies achieving their objectives, and is sustainable development being delivered? * Have policies had the intended consequences? * Are the assumptions and objectives behind policies still relevant? * Are the targets set in the Local Development Framework being achieved? To achieve this goal, the Annual Monitoring Report includes a range of local and standard (Core Output) indicators. Optional development plan documents *Area Action Plan: an optional development plan document aimed at establishing a set of proposals and policies for the development of a specific area (such as a town centre or an area of new development) of a district authority.Plymouth City Council - Derriford and Seaton Area Action Plan https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/planningandbuildingcontrol/localdevelopmentframework/areaactionplans/derrifordandseatonareaactionplan There is no limit on the number of area action plans that a local authority can develop. *Supplementary planning documents: established as part of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 in United Kingdom law, SPDs may cover a range of issues, thematic or site-specific, and provides further detail of policies and proposals in a 'parent' development plan document. *Local development orders *Simplified planning zones Sometimes certain policies from an old document remain effective when that document is superseded.

Alderdice told the public and international community that it would be in default on payments to the public debt, which then stood at $100 million. This worried the British and Canadian governments who feared this would cause a bad reaction on the already fragile stock markets during the Great Depression. It was agreed then, that Canada and Britain would provide short term financial assistance pending the full report of a royal commission. The British government appointed the chairman, Lord Amulree. The Canadian government appointed Charles Alexander Magrath, a former member of the House of Commons of Canada, and the Newfoundland government appointed Sir William Ewen Stavert, a Canadian who was financial advisor to the Newfoundland government.  Events of the Commission  * March 12, the three commissioners met in St. John's and were received by Governor David Murray Anderson. * March 16, the Prime Minister formally welcomed the Commission on behalf of the government and the Newfoundland people. * March 20, the commission commenced regular sitting for the purpose of hearing evidence. This continued five days a week until April 14. * April 17, the commission left the capital of St. John's to tour some of the coastal towns and villages. Over the next two weeks the commission visited the communities of Harbour Grace, Carbonear, Heart's Content, Winterton, Bonavista, Catalina, Trinity, Lewisporte, Stephenville, and St. George's. * April 28, the commission departed Newfoundland for Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, where it stayed until May 22 gathering information from witnesses who could not meet the commission in St. John's. * The commission next proceeded to Montreal, to interview the general managers of the Bank of Montreal on the subject of Newfoundland's debt. * May 24, the commission left Montreal for Halifax where it interviewed the general managers of the Bank of Nova Scotia, and heard more evidence, mostly relating to the Newfoundland fishery * May 27, the commission left Halifax and arrived in St. John's on May 29 * May 30, the commission resumed sittings in St. John's and continued until the end of June. * In total, the commission held approximately 100 formal sittings and listened to 260 witnesses.  Main recommendations of the Commission  * The existing form of government would be suspended until such time as the Island may become self-supporting. * A special Commission of Government would be created which would be presided over by the Governor, and would take the place of the existing Legislature and Executive Council. * The Commission of Government would be composed of six members, exclusive of the Governor, three of whom would be drawn from Newfoundland and three from the United Kingdom. * The Government Departments in the Island would be divided into six groups. Each group would be placed in the charge of a Member of the Commission of Government, who would be responsible for the efficient working of the Departments. * The proceedings of the Commission of Government would be subject to supervisory control by the government of the United Kingdom, and the Governor would be responsible to the Secretary of State for Newfoundland in the United Kingdom for the good governance of the Island. * The government of the United Kingdom would be responsible for the finances of the island until the time in which the island is once again self-sufficient. * It would be understood that, as soon as the Island's difficulties are overcome and the country is again self-supporting, responsible government, on request from the people of Newfoundland, would be restored.  Aftermath  The report and recommendations were well received by both the media and most members of the public. In November 1933, it was debated by the legislature which subsequently passed an address to the Crown requesting the suspension of the constitution. The Newfoundland Act 1933, an Act of the British parliament providing for direct rule became law in December 1934. The Commission of Government took control of the country in February 1934.

Dick. It was written in 1964 and first published under the title Project Plowshare as a serial in the November 1965 and January 1966 issues of Worlds of Tomorrow magazine.The Zap Gun Plot This novel is set in a then-future 2004. There is still a (theoretical) Cold War between the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union and its allies. At the elite governmental level, however, both \\"sides\\" have secretly come to an agreement. They have decided that, instead of continuing the ecologically and economically crippling nuclear and conventional arms race, they will pretend to be constantly developing new weapons, which are then \\"plowshared\\". This means that these items are transformed into novel but baroque consumer products. Most of these weapon designers are mediums, who create their new designs in trance states. Design of weapons are extracted telepathically from a motion comic book, The Blue Cephalopod Man from Titan, created by mad Italian artist Oral Giacomini. One Wes-Bloc weapons designer, Lars Powderdry (Mr. Lars of Mr. Lars Incorporated) is the central character. He is depressed that his industry is little more than a fraud, as none of his \\"weapons\\" are functional, having become fashion items instead. The plowshared guidance system of Item 202, a telepathic featureless brazen head named Ol' Orville, explains that this depression is merely a projection of his own fears of professional and physical impotence. His female Peep-East counterpart is Lilo Topchev, whom he knows nothing about, but whom Ol' Orville advises him to seduce. He also has a mistress, Maren Faine, head of his company's Parisian branch. Apart from the comic overtones of this deception, there is a subplot related to alien invasion. Sirian aliens invade Earth, and are determined to enslave its populace. The aliens' first target is New Orleans, which is enshrouded in a \\"gray curtain of death\\". Earth has a problem, given the deceptive nature of its arms race and the absence of functional weapons technology. Lilo immediately tries to kill Lars, despite the intentions of their blocs otherwise, but eventually they collaborate. Neither can design functional weapons, however. There is a further subplot about a conspiracy theorist, who is elected as an \\"average man\\" to the governing body of Wes-Bloc. The conclusion involves an eclectic mixture of time travel, androids, drugs, toys, and comic books.

He included in his Glossai a Homeric vocabulary as well, as with most of the Alexandrian grammarians. The only marked Macedonian term, given by Hesychius, is sauadai, saudoi, silenoi.

Classical real Minkowski plane classical Minkowski plane: 2d/3d-model Applying the pseudo-euclidean distance d(P_1,P_2)=(x'_1-x'_2)^2-(y'_1-y'_2)^2 on two points P_i=(x'_i,y'_i) (instead of the euclidean distance) we get the geometry of hyperbolas, because a pseudo-euclidean circle \\\\\\\\{P\\\\in \\\\R^2 \\\\ \\\\ d(P,M)=r\\\\\\\\} is a hyperbola with midpoint M. By a transformation of coordinates x_i=x'_i+y'_i, y_i=x'_i-y'_i, the pseudo-euclidean distance can be rewritten as d(P_1,P_2)=(x_1-x_2)(y_1-y_2). The hyperbolas then have asymptotes parallel to the non-primed coordinate axes. The following completion (see M√∂bius and Laguerre planes) homogenizes the geometry of hyperbolas: : \\\\mathcal P:=(\\\\R\\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\})^2= \\\\R^2 \\\\cup (\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} \\\\times\\\\R) \\\\cup (\\\\R\\\\times\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}) \\\\ \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{(\\\\infty,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\} \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\infty otin \\\\R, the set of points, : \\\\mathcal Z:=\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{(x,y)\\\\in \\\\R^2 \\\\ \\\\ y=ax+b\\\\\\\\}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{(\\\\infty,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\} \\\\ \\\\ a,b \\\\in \\\\R, a e 0\\\\\\\\} ::: \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{(x,y)\\\\in \\\\R^2\\\\ y=\\\\frac{a}{x-b}+c,x e b\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{(b,\\\\infty),(\\\\infty,c)\\\\\\\\} \\\\ \\\\ a,b,c \\\\in \\\\R, a e 0\\\\\\\\}, the set of cycles. The incidence structure ({\\\\mathcal P},{\\\\mathcal Z},\\\\in) is called the classical real Minkowski plane. The set of points consists of \\\\R^2, two copies of \\\\R and the point (\\\\infty,\\\\infty). Any line y=ax+b ,a e0 is completed by point (\\\\infty,\\\\infty), any hyperbola y=\\\\frac{a}{x-b}+c,a e0 by the two points (b,\\\\infty),(\\\\infty,c) (see figure). Two points (x_1,y_1) e(x_2,y_2) can not be connected by a cycle if and only if x_1=x_2 or y_1=y_2. We define: Two points P_1,P_2 are (+)-parallel (P_1\\\\parallel_+ P_2) if x_1=x_2 and (‚àí)-parallel (P_1\\\\parallel_- P_2) if y_1=y_2. Both these relations are equivalence relations on the set of points. Two points P_1,P_2 are called parallel (P_1\\\\parallel P_2) if P_1\\\\parallel_+ P_2 or P_1\\\\parallel_- P_2. From the definition above we find: Lemma: :*For any pair of non parallel points A,B there is exactly one point C with A\\\\parallel_+ C \\\\parallel_- B. :*For any point P and any cycle z there are exactly two points A,B \\\\in z with A\\\\parallel_+ P \\\\parallel_- B. :*For any three points A, B, C, pairwise non parallel, there is exactly one cycle z that contains A,B,C. :*For any cycle z, any point P\\\\in z and any point Q, P ot\\\\parallel Q and Q otin z there exists exactly one cycle z' such that z\\\\cap z'=\\\\\\\\{P\\\\\\\\}, i.e. z touches z' at point P. Like the classical M√∂bius and Laguerre planes Minkowski planes can be described as the geometry of plane sections of a suitable quadric. But in this case the quadric lives in projective 3-space: The classical real Minkowski plane is isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections of a hyperboloid of one sheet (not degenerated quadric of index 2). The axioms of a Minkowski plane Let \\\\left( {\\\\mathcal P} , {\\\\mathcal Z} ; \\\\parallel_+ , \\\\parallel_- , \\\\in \\\\right) be an incidence structure with the set \\\\mathcal P of points, the set \\\\mathcal Z of cycles and two equivalence relations \\\\parallel_+ ((+)-parallel) and \\\\parallel_- ((‚àí)-parallel) on set \\\\mathcal P. For P\\\\in \\\\mathcal P we define: \\\\overline{P}_+ := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. Q \\\\in \\\\mathcal P \\\\ \\\\right\\\\ Q\\\\parallel_+ P \\\\right\\\\\\\\} and \\\\overline{P}_- := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. Q \\\\in \\\\mathcal P \\\\ \\\\right\\\\ Q\\\\parallel_- P \\\\right\\\\\\\\} . An equivalence class \\\\overline{P}_+ or \\\\overline{P}_- is called (+)-generator and (‚àí)-generator, respectively. (For the space model of the classical Minkowski plane a generator is a line on the hyperboloid.) Two points A , B are called parallel ( A \\\\parallel B ) if A \\\\parallel_+ B or A \\\\parallel_- B. An incidence structure {\\\\mathfrak M} := ( {\\\\mathcal P} , {\\\\mathcal Z} ; \\\\parallel_+ , \\\\parallel_- , \\\\in ) is called Minkowski plane if the following axioms hold: Minkowski-axioms-c1-c2 Minkowski-axioms-c3-c4 * C1: For any pair of non parallel points A,B there is exactly one point C with A\\\\parallel_+ C \\\\parallel_- B . * C2: For any point P and any cycle z there are exactly two points A , B \\\\in z with A\\\\parallel_+ P \\\\parallel_- B . * C3: For any three points A,B,C, pairwise non parallel, there is exactly one cycle z which contains A , B , C . * C4: For any cycle z, any point P\\\\in z and any point Q, P ot\\\\parallel Q and Q otin z there exists exactly one cycle z' such that z \\\\cap z' = \\\\\\\\{ P \\\\\\\\} , i.e. z touches z' at point P . * C5: Any cycle contains at least 3 points. There is at least one cycle z and a point P not in z. For investigations the following statements on parallel classes (equivalent to C1, C2 respectively) are advantageous. :C1‚Ä≤: For any two points A , B we have \\\\left\\\\overline{A}_+ \\\\cap\\\\overline{B}_- \\\\right= 1 . :C2‚Ä≤: For any point P and any cycle z we have: \\\\left\\\\overline{P}_+ \\\\cap z \\\\right = 1 = \\\\left\\\\overline{P}_- \\\\cap z \\\\right. First consequences of the axioms are Lemma: For a Minkowski plane {\\\\mathfrak M} the following is true :a) Any point is contained in at least one cycle. :b) Any generator contains at least 3 points. :c) Two points can be connected by a cycle if and only if they are non parallel. Analogously to M√∂bius and Laguerre planes we get the connection to the linear geometry via the residues. For a Minkowski plane {\\\\mathfrak M}=({\\\\mathcal P},{\\\\mathcal Z};\\\\parallel_+,\\\\parallel_-,\\\\in) and P \\\\in \\\\mathcal P we define the local structure : \\\\mathfrak A_P:= (\\\\mathcal P\\\\setminus\\\\overline{P},\\\\\\\\{z\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{\\\\overline{P}\\\\\\\\} \\\\ \\\\ P\\\\in z\\\\in\\\\mathcal Z\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{E\\\\setminus \\\\overline{P} \\\\ \\\\ E\\\\in {\\\\mathcal E}\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{\\\\overline{P}_+,\\\\overline{P}_-\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}, \\\\in) and call it the residue at point P. For the classical Minkowski plane \\\\mathfrak A_{(\\\\infty,\\\\infty)} is the real affine plane \\\\R^2. An immediate consequence of axioms C1 to C4 and C1‚Ä≤, C2‚Ä≤ are the following two theorems. Theorem: For a Minkowski plane {\\\\mathfrak M} = ( {\\\\mathcal P} , {\\\\mathcal Z} ; \\\\parallel_+ , \\\\parallel , \\\\in ) any residue is an affine plane. Theorem: Let be {\\\\mathfrak M}=({\\\\mathcal P},{\\\\mathcal Z};\\\\parallel_+,\\\\parallel_-,\\\\in) an incidence structure with two equivalence relations \\\\parallel_+ and \\\\parallel_- on the set \\\\mathcal P of points (see above). :{\\\\mathfrak M} is a Minkowski plane if and only if for any point P the residue \\\\mathfrak A_P is an affine plane. Minimal model Minkowski plane: minimal model The minimal model of a Minkowski plane can be established over the set \\\\overline{K}:=\\\\\\\\{0,1,\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} of three elements: \\\\mathcal {P}:= {\\\\overline{K}}^2 \\\\qquad \\\\mathcal Z:= \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{ (a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),(a_3,b_3) \\\\\\\\}  \\\\\\\\{a_1,a_2,a_3\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\\\\\\\}=\\\\overline{K} \\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{ (0,0),(1,1),(\\\\infty,\\\\infty) \\\\\\\\} , \\\\\\\\{ (0,0),(1,\\\\infty),(\\\\infty,1) \\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{ (0,1),(1,0),(\\\\infty,\\\\infty) \\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{ (0,1),(1,\\\\infty),(\\\\infty,0) \\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{ (0,\\\\infty),(1,1),(\\\\infty,0) \\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{ (0,\\\\infty),(1,0),(\\\\infty,1) \\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\} Parallel points: (x_1,y_1) \\\\parallel_+ (x_2,y_2) if and only if x_1 = x_2 (x_1,y_1)\\\\parallel_- (x_2,y_2) if and only if y_1 = y_2 . Hence: \\\\left\\\\mathcal P \\\\right= 9 and \\\\left\\\\mathcal Z \\\\right= 6 . Finite Minkowski-planes For finite Minkowski-planes we get from C1‚Ä≤, C2‚Ä≤: Lemma: Let be {\\\\mathfrak M}=({\\\\mathcal P},{\\\\mathcal Z};\\\\parallel_+,\\\\parallel_-,\\\\in) a finite Minkowski plane, i.e. \\\\left\\\\mathcal P \\\\right< \\\\infty . For any pair of cycles z_1 , z_2 and any pair of generators e_1 , e_2 we have: \\\\leftz_1 \\\\right= \\\\leftz_2 \\\\right= \\\\lefte_1 \\\\right= \\\\lefte_2 \\\\right. This gives rise of the definition: For a finite Minkowski plane {\\\\mathfrak M} and a cycle z of {\\\\mathfrak M} we call the integer n = \\\\leftz \\\\right- 1 the order of {\\\\mathfrak M}. Simple combinatorial considerations yield Lemma: For a finite Minkowski plane {\\\\mathfrak M} = ({\\\\mathcal P} , {\\\\mathcal Z} ; \\\\parallel_+ , \\\\parallel_- , \\\\in ) the following is true: : a) Any residue (affine plane) has order n. : b) \\\\left\\\\mathcal P \\\\right= ( n + 1 ) ^2 , : c) \\\\left\\\\mathcal Z \\\\right= ( n + 1 ) n ( n - 1 ) . Miquelian Minkowski planes We get the most important examples of Minkowski planes by generalizing the classical real model: Just replace \\\\R by an arbitrary field K then we get in any case a Minkowski plane {\\\\mathfrak M}(K)=({\\\\mathcal P},{\\\\mathcal Z};\\\\parallel_+,\\\\parallel_-,\\\\in). Analogously to M√∂bius and Laguerre planes the Theorem of Miquel is a characteristic property of a Minkowski plane \\\\mathfrak M (K). Theorem of Miquel Theorem (Miquel): For the Minkowski plane \\\\mathfrak M (K) the following is true: : If for any 8 pairwise not parallel points P_1,...,P_8 which can be assigned to the vertices of a cube such that the points in 5 faces correspond to concyclical quadruples than the sixth quadruple of points is concyclical, too. (For a better overview in the figure there are circles drawn instead of hyperbolas.) Theorem (Chen): Only a Minkowski plane \\\\mathfrak M (K) satisfies the theorem of Miquel. Because of the last theorem \\\\mathfrak M(K) is called a miquelian Minkowski plane. Remark: The minimal model of a Minkowski plane is miquelian. : It is isomorphic to the Minkowski plane \\\\mathfrak M(K) with K = \\\\operatorname{GF}(2) (field \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}). An astonishing result is Theorem (Heise): Any Minkowski plane of even order is miquelian. Remark: A suitable stereographic projection shows: \\\\mathfrak M(K) is isomorphic to the geometry of the plane sections on a hyperboloid of one sheet (quadric of index 2) in projective 3-space over field K . Remark: There are a lot of Minkowski planes that are not miquelian (s. weblink below). But there are no \\"ovoidal Minkowski\\" planes, in difference to M√∂bius and Laguerre planes. Because any quadratic set of index 2 in projective 3-space is a quadric (see quadratic set). See also * Conformal geometry References * W.

Early life Jackson is a son of Dr. Jimmy Jackson, a fixture in the Dickson medical community who operated (along with his brothers Lawerence and William) the former Goodlark Medical Center (now HCA- owned Horizon Medical Center). Most of the descendants of these three physicians and brothers entered the medical field, but Doug chose instead the study of law following his graduation from Battle Ground Academy in Franklin, Tennessee and Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tennessee. Jackson's legal studies were undertaken at the Cumberland School of Law at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, after which he was admitted to the Tennessee bar. In addition to the regular practice of law, Jackson often assisted his father with regard to legal issues affecting his operation of the hospital and practice of medicine. In 1986, Jackson decided to challenge long- term incumbent Walter \\"Buck\\" Work for his seat in the 69th House District of the Tennessee General Assembly. State House of Representatives Defeating Work handily in the August Democratic Party primary, Jackson coasted to election in November by a margin of roughly two to one over his Republican opponent in what was at the time still an overwhelmingly Democratic district. After this he never faced a truly well-funded or highly organized campaign against him for the next six two-year terms, never failing to receive less than 57% of the vote in any contest despite the district's increasingly Republican nature. During this period, Jackson established a fairly conservative voting record, generally being pro-business and always anti- abortion, a position at odds with the national Democratic Party but well in tune with a majority of his constituents. He has stated that his pro-life views grow naturally from his Catholic faith and were not politically motivated or in any way negotiable. It was reported that Jackson was among several Democratic House members approached by the Republican Party after they had gained temporary control of the Tennessee State Senate through party switching to take part in a similar effort in the House but that he declined to do so. In 1994 and during his House tenure, Jackson survived a very serious bout with cancer, which forced him to miss many legislative meetings. When he reappeared on the House floor, still bald from the effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments, it was to a protracted standing ovation. As of 2019, Jackson has suffered no recurrence. State Senate Following his family's sale of Goodlark Medical Center to HCA, the funds for the proceeds from this sale were placed in a foundation, the Jackson Foundation, which was established for the primary purpose of operating an educational and cultural center on State Route 46 south of Dickson. Jackson was named executive director of the foundation and the center and was reportedly not intending to seek any further terms in the House. However, when 25th District State Senator Kenneth N. \\"Pete\\" Springer was found dead in his apartment in early 2000, Jackson's plans suddenly changed. Springer's widow was elected by the Hickman County Commission as an interim replacement; it was correctly assumed that she had little interest in politics and would serve merely as a caretaker with no desire to stand for election in her own right. Jackson soon entered the hotly contested primary for the remaining two years of Springer's term and defeated, among others, Springer's former staff director and campaign manager in August 2000. The Tennessee Republican Party made a concerted effort to regain the control of the state senate that fall that it had lost when the party switchers mentioned above retired from office, so Jackson was to face a hard- fought campaign for the November election against Decaturville, Tennessee businesswoman Bonnie Butler, whom he defeated by a margin of 55% to 45%. Subsequent elections Jackson was elected to a full term in November 2002 by a larger margin over his Republican opponent, retired Humphreys County educator Jim Brasfield, than he had won over Butler two years previously. Jackson apparently remained quite popular; he won the Democratic nomination for a third (second full) term in the Tennessee Senate on August 3, 2006 with over 80% of the vote. However, he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jim Somerville on November 2, 2010, ending his Senate service. Legislative actions Jackson sponsored a controversial bill \\"allowing Tennessee's estimated 270,000 handgun-carry permit holders to go armed in restaurants, bars, museums and other establishments licensed to sell alcohol for on-premises consumption (providing that they refrained from consuming themselves while armed).\\"http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/may/19/bredesen-vetoes-new- guns-in-bars-bill/ The Senate voted to override an earlier veto by Tennessee's Governor Phil Bredesen on May 28, 2010. The law took effect on July 1 of that year. Democratic then-Governor Phil Bredesen opposed the \\"guns bill sponsored by Sen. Doug Jackson, D-Dickson, on the basis that 'guns and alcohol don't mix.'\\"http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100528/NEWS0201/5280340/TN-Senate- overrides-guns-in-bars-veto Despite Jackson's assertion that, \\"I haven't gotten a complaint from a single citizen that a permit holder made them feel uncomfortable\\" http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100527/NEWS02/100527060/Senate+overrides+veto+of+guns+bill there was some public outcry and websites started to voice opposition to the law. At the time of its passage, many high-profile law enforcement officers stood in opposition to Jackson's position on the bill.http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2010/05/21/110032.htm Jackson received public attention in early 2006 as a sponsor of a bill to increase Tennessee's minimum wage to $1.00 an hour above the then-federally required $5.15/hr. Unlike many other states, Tennessee has never had a state minimum wage requirement in excess of the federal rate. This bill faced stiff opposition from business interests which have often supported Jackson in the past, as well as Republican members. Jackson's passed on the floor of the then-Democrat controlled House but failed on the floor of the Republican- controlled senate. The vote broke along party lines.

Although the Voice of America was prohibited from broadcasting in the United States by the Smith-Mundt Act, the shortwave signal was receivable in the US and had a sizable USA audience.  Contributions to the Cold War  As jazz was frequently banned in the Soviet Union and countries sympathetic to its views, Voice of America was often the only way people in those countries could listen to jazz, and Willis Conover's politics-free broadcasts are widely credited for keeping interest in jazz active in Soviet satellite states.

Noted for his diffident on-stage persona, Chippington eschews observational comedy in favour of anti-humour and jokes which are mostly variations on the same theme, delivered in a West Midlands monotone. He also frequently performs his own versions of well-known songs in a similarly listless style. His act has left audiences bemused or hostile, with heckling a frequent occurrence during his performances. His deadpan style has won him a small but devoted number of followers. Stewart Lee has often cited Chippington as the reason he began stand-up comedy, describing Chippington's act as \\"a mixture of surrealism and insolent provocation and uncompromising boredom\\"Stewart Lee website, July 2005 and citing him as \\"the first post-alternative comedian\\". Another admirer, Richard Herring, talks of Chippington's \\"contempt for the very idea of jokes\\". For his part Chippington - who describes his own act as being influenced by Lenny Bruce and Owd Grandad Piggott \\\\- says he is an \\"anti-comedian\\" and that he only started doing his act \\"to annoy people\\". He has even claimed that his main reason for retiring from the stage in the 1990s was that he was becoming too popular. Early years Chippington started performing in 1981 under the name \\"Eddie Chippington\\" before changing to Ted \\"due to maturity and baldness\\". He first came to national prominence when a gig he had performed in Birmingham in 1984 supporting the Fall was released by local record label Vindaloo on a 7\\" EP entitled Non Stop Party Hits of the '50s, '60s and '70s. The EP title refers to his penchant for performing his own versions of classic hits, including on this occasion his rendering of Ottawan's \\"D.I.S.C.O.\\". The record was played by John Peel on his BBC Radio One programme - a rare occurrence for a comedian. In 1986 he released an album, Man in a Suitcase - a collection of live recordings plus some more songs, including his versions of \\"She Loves You\\" and Alvin Stardust's \\"I Feel Like Buddy Holly\\" - which reached the Top 10 indie album chart. \\"She Loves You\\" received wider exposure after Steve Wright repeatedly played it on his Radio 1 show, which in turn led to the track being released as a single by Warner Brothers. It narrowly failed to make the Top 75 but Chippington claims that the deal with Warners' earned him \\"¬£1,000 and a nice curry\\".Interview with Phill Jupitus, BBC 6 Music, 5 February 2007 Despite its failure to crack the charts, \\"She Loves You\\" raised Chippington's profile considerably and led to numerous media appearances, including a turn on the BBC's lunchtime magazine show Pebble Mill at One, the latter fulfilling a lifelong ambition. Chippington also fielded interviews with the New Musical Express, Birmingham's BRMB and the colour supplement of the Mail on Sunday. He also performed at the Glastonbury and Reading festivals. Chippington once again came close to mainstream UK singles chart success with a recording of his theme tune \\"Rockin' with Rita (Head to Toe)\\" which he performed with his fellow Vindaloo artists the Nightingales and We've Got a Fuzzbox and We're Gonna Use It. A further single followed with his reading of Dion's \\"The Wanderer\\", in which the boastfulness of the original lyrics was turned on its head: \\"I'm not the wanderer, I'm not the wanderer...not too keen on roaming around and around and around\\". At a time when the alternative comedy boom was at its peak, Chippington - who once claimed his favourite comedian was Bernard Manning \\\\- struggled to break through to a wider audience. Retirement In 1990, feeling overwhelmed by the media attention, Chippington retired from show business and emigrated to the US. Rumours circulated that he had gone there to work as a truck driver, but he was working in Los Angeles as a chef. He later returned to the UK, getting married and settling in Torquay after a spell in London. Return to performing In 2007 he started performing again. Initially styling himself the \\"Reverend Ted Chippington\\", he's ditched his old Teddy Boy stage outfit in favour of a vicar's dog-collar. He has also changed much of his material. In 2007 a CD boxset of Chippington's earlier work, entitled Walking Down the Road, was released on Robert Lloyd's Big Print label. A tribute to Chippington entitled \\"Tedstock\\", featuring Stewart Lee, Richard Herring and numerous other stand-up comedians, was held at London's Bloomsbury Theatre in order to fund this release. This event led to a new flurry of media appearances for Chippington, including articles in national newspapers \\"The comedian who vanished\\", The Independent, 1 February 2007\\"Father Ted\\", The Guardian, 3 February 2007 and television and radio appearances.Clip from The Culture Show, BBC Two, 3 February 2007 Since his return, he has toured regularly, invariably with the Nightingales, and visiting France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Ireland. He has also made guest appearances on the Marc Riley and Phill Jupitus radio shows.

From 1894 through 1906, he played for the Washington Senators (NL), Cincinnati Reds, New York Giants, Baltimore Orioles, Washington Senators (AL) and Boston Ameiricans (1904‚Äì1906). Selbach batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Columbus, Ohio. Career A strong defensive player and good contact hitter, Selbach made his debut with the Washington Senators of the National League in 1894. He hit over .300 during his first five major league seasons, with a high .322 in 1895, and in 1896 posted career-highs with 115 runs, 100 RBI, 49 stolen bases and 22 triples (a NL lead). Then, in 1897, he scored 113 runs with 25 doubles, 16 triples and 46 steals, while batting .313. Selbach was sold by Washington to the Cincinnati Reds before the 1899 season. After hit .296 for his new team, he was sold to the New York Giants at the end of the season. With the Giants, Selbach posted career-highs with a .337 average and 176 hits in 1900, while scoring 98 runs with 36 steals. In 1902 Selbach moved to the new American League, playing for the first Baltimore Orioles team, the new Washington Senators, and the Boston Red Sox. He enjoyed a productive season in first AL year, hitting .320 with the Orioles. After that, he played part of two seasons with Washington and ended his major league career with Boston in 1906. In a 13-season career, Selbach was a .293 hitter with 44 home runs and 779 RBI in 1612 games played. He added 1066 runs, 1807 hits, 301 doubles, 149 triples and 334 stolen bases. Selbach died in Columbus, Ohio, at the age of 83.

It is created by Robert Quattlebaum with additional contributions by Adrian Bentley. Synfig began as the custom animation platform for Voria Studios (now defunct), and in 2005 was released as free/open source software, under the GNU General Public License.  Features  As a true front-end and back-end application, it is possible to design the animation in the front-end, Synfig Studio, and to render it at a later time with the backend, Synfig Tool, on another (potentially faster) computer without a graphical display connected. Incremental and parallel rendering with Synfig Tool is supported by some open source render farm management software, such as RenderChan. The goal of the developers is to create a program that is capable of producing \\"feature-film quality animation with fewer people and resources.\\" The program offers an alternative to manual tweening so that the animator does not have to draw each and every frame. The software is capable of simulating soft-shading using curved gradients within an area so that the animator doesn't have to draw shading into every single frame. There is also a wide variety of other real-time effects that can be applied to layers or groups of layers like radial blurs, color tweaks that all are resolution-independent. Other features include the ability to control and animate the width of lines at their individual control points, and the ability to link any related data from one object to another. Synfig also works with High Dynamic Range Imaging.  File formats  Synfig stores its animations in its own XML file format, often compressed with gzip. These files use the filename extension .sif (uncompressed), .sifz (compressed) or .sfg (zip container format). The files store vector graphics data, embed or reference external bitmap images, and also a revision history of the project. Synfig can render to video formats such as AVI, Theora and MPEG, as well as animated graphics formats such as MNG and GIF. It can also render to a sequence of numbered image files, using formats such as PNG, BMP, PPM and OpenEXR. From version 0.62.00, Synfig has basic support for SVG import. From version 0.91 Inkscape can save as .sif file format.  Uses  Morevna Project. Since May 2008, a group of Russian volunteers have been trying to make an animation movie project called the Morevna Project using Synfig, based on the folk-tale of Marya Morevna re- invented as a science fiction anime. They have been making regular updates since then on the Morevna project site, including a demo video released on November 10, 2012. Free Software Magazine contained an article on the project.  Name  It was originally called SINFG, a recursive acronym for \\"SINFG Is Not A Fractal Generator\\", referring to the software's capability of generating fractal imagery in addition to animation.

During the post‚ÄìWorld War II baby boom era, Ideal became the largest doll-making company in the United States. Their most popular dolls included Betsy Wetsy,Hays, Constance L. \\"Judith Albert, 59, Toy Designer Whose Doll Led to Buyer Frenzy,\\" New York Times (Aug. 1, 1998). Toni, Saucy Walker, Shirley Temple, Miss Revlon, Patti Playpal, Tammy, Thumbelina, Tiny Thumbelina, and Crissy. Their last big hit was the Rubik's Cube. History Original Ideal logo, 1938 Corporate history Morris and Rose Michtom founded the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company in Brooklyn when they invented the Teddy bear in 1903. After Michtom's death in 1938, the company changed its name to the Ideal Toy Company, and Michtom's nephew Abraham Katz became chief executive. During World War II, the company's value rose from $2 million to $11 million. The company's dolls were so popular during the post‚ÄìWorld War II baby boom era, they began selling dolls under license in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. Key Ideal employees during the 1950s, '60s, and '70s were Lionel A. Weintraub and Joseph C. Winkler. Weintraub, the son-in-law of Abraham Katz, joined the company in 1941 and rose to become president, chairman of the board, and chief executive officer. Winkler joined Ideal in 1956, rising to vice president by 1971.Sloane, Leonard. \\"Business People: Ideal Toy Gets A New President,\\" New York Times (May 27, 1981). In 1951, Ideal partnered with competitors the American Character Doll Company and the Alexander Doll Company to establish the United States-Israeli Toy and Plastic Corporation, designed to produce material for toys in Israel and the U.S. Ideal CEO Abraham Katz was named president of the new company.\\"PLANT IN TEL AVIV TO MAKE PLASTICS: New $1,000,000 Concern Plans Range of Products From Toys to Building Items To Make Plastic Parts,\\" New York Times (November 8, 1951), p. 49.

Accessed Dec. 26, 2014. as well as specific products like the \\"Tressy\\" Gro-Hair doll. In late 1971, Ideal joined the New York Stock Exchange; valued at $71 million, it was one of the U.S.'s top three toy companies.Sloan, Leonard. \\"Ideal Toy's Weintraub Tries to Create Fun Potential,\\" New York Times (Oct. 24, 1971). By 1970, Ideal had outgrown its manufacturing complex in Hollis, Queens. The company wanted to build a new plant in College Point, Queens (later the site of Shea Stadium), but was unable to strike a deal with the Lindsay administration. Consequently, the company opened a new facility in Newark, New Jersey, in the early 1970s, while continuing to operate its factory in Hollis.\\"Ideal Toy Corp. Moving Queens Offices to Jersey,\\" New York Times (May 14, 1982). Ideal had earnings of $3.7 million in fiscal year 1979‚Äì1980, but lost $15.5 million in fiscal year 1980‚Äì1981. (Sales both years averaged c. $150 million.) Trying to maximize profits on the Rubik's Cube craze, in May 1981 Ideal filed civil suits against dozens of distributors and retailers selling knockoff cubes.Roman, Mark. \\"Other Business; Rubik's Cube: Ideal Toy Takes on the Knock-Offs,\\" New York Times (Oct. 4, 1981). In May 1981, Joseph Winkler was named Ideal's president, succeeding Lionel Weintraub, who remained chairman and CEO. In 1982, the company moved its headquarters from Hollis, Queens, to Harmon Meadow, New Jersey. It was sold to CBS Toys later that year for c. $58 million. In 1987, CBS sold Ideal to Viewmaster International, which renamed itself View-Master Ideal in the process. In 1989, View-Master Ideal was bought by Tyco Toys of Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, for $43.9 million.Reuters. \\"COMPANY NEWS; Tyco to Acquire View-Master Ideal,\\" New York Times (May 24, 1989). The Ideal line remained part of Tyco until Tyco's merger with Mattel, Inc., in 1997. Ideal's United Kingdom assets were sold to Hasbro, which has since released Mouse Trap and KerPlunk under its MB Games brand. Other toys that originated with Ideal continue to be marketed and sold by other companies, including Rubik's Cube by Hasbro and Magic 8-ball by Mattel. The Ideal trademarks, and most toy molds not purchased by Hasbro or Mattel, were purchased by Jay Horowitz of American Plastic Equipment, who later transferred all rights to American Plastic Equipment's subsidiary, American Classic Toys. Mr. Horowitz licensed the trademark and toy rights to Plaza Toys, to be used on its Fiddlestix building sticks products, and eventually sold the mark and toy rights in January 2011 to Poof-Slinky. In January 2014, the Ideal brand and toy rights became part of a new company, Alex Brands, after the May 2013 acquisition of Alex Toys by Propel Equity Partners.https://www.alexbrands.com/alex-toys-poof-slinky-and-zoob-come- together-under-new-collective-brand-identity/ In early 2019, Jay Horowitz of American Classic Toys, entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Juna Group to represent select Ideal brands - not included in the sale to Poof-Slinky - in all categories outside of toys and playthings, worldwide. Products history Ideal began making dolls in 1907 to complement its line of teddy bears. Their first doll was ‚ÄúYellow Kid‚Äù from Richard Felton Outcault's comic strip of the same name. After that Ideal began making a line of baby and character dolls such as Naughty Marietta (from the Victor Herbert operetta), and Admiral Dot. Ideal advertised their dolls as \\"unbreakable,\\" since they were made of composition, a material made of sawdust and glue. Ideal produced over 200 variations of dolls throughout the composition era.Izen, Judith. Collector's Guide to Ideal Dolls: Identification and Value Guide , 3rd Edition. Collector's Books, 2005 Understanding branding well, Ideal had a boy doll launched in 1914 named the Uneeda Kid, after a biscuit company. One of Ideal's most lasting products was Betsy Wetsy, introduced in 1934 and in production for more than 50 years. The doll was named after the daughter of Abraham Katz, the head of the company. Ideal, via the Betsy Wetsy doll, was also one of the first doll manufacturers to produce an African American version of a popular doll.Waggoner, Susan. Under the Tree: the Toys and Treats That Made Christmas Special, 1930-1970. Stewart, Tabori & Chang, 2007. In 2003, the Toy Industry Association named Betsy Wetsy to its Century of Toys List, a compilation commemorating the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century. Debuting in 1934, the Shirley Temple doll was their best-selling doll. Ideal follow up with licensed Disney dolls and a Judy Garland doll. Two cosmetics-based doll series were launched after World War II: Toni was introduced at the end of the 1940s, followed by the 1950s-dominating Miss Revlon series. Ideal had a hobby division in the 1950s, but shifted from that to games in 1962. By the early 1970s, 30% of the company's sales were games such as Mouse Trap and Hands Down. Doll designer Judith Albert worked for Ideal Toy Company from 1960‚Äì1982. Master sculptor Vincent J. DeFilippo spent 27 years creating dolls for Ideal from 1963‚Äì1980. Some of the company's most popular dolls during this period were Tammy (1962‚Äì1966), Flatsy dolls (1969‚Äì1973), Crissy (1969‚Äì1974), and Tressy (1970‚Äì1972). Popular Ideal toys in the 1970s included a full line of Evel Knievel toys, Snoopy toys, and the Tuesday Taylor and Wake-up Thumbelina dolls. For a short time, the company had a huge seller with the Magic Cube, which it imported from Hungary in 1980 and renamed Rubik's Cube.Daintith, John (1994). A Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists.

The Merlin Rocket is a dinghy sailed in the United Kingdom. It is an active class, now with over 3700 boats built. The boat designed around a box rule, meaning that all class boats need to be within a certain length and width, but can be any shape. This allows for quick modernization of the class. The great advantage to this is quick adoption to new technology and the ability to change a boat to a person's weight and ability. Although the rules allow for many sail plans, many modern Rockets have similar sails. Most have a high batten allowing for a large roach in the sail. Although the rules are open, they are not unlimited. Use of a Trapeze is forbidden in this class. When competing in a mixed fleet, the Merlin Rocket uses a Portsmouth Yardstick handicap of 1002 in the RYA scheme and 77.9 in the US Sailing scheme. History Merlin #1 'Kate' in Merlin Open at Ranelagh Sailing Club, Sept. 6, 2020 The 'Merlin Rocket class' was created by the merger of two previously separate classes. The 'Merlin' was originally designed in 1945/6 by Jack Holt as a result of discussions among and commissioning by a syndicate of members, including Holt, of Ranelagh Sailing Club, on the Thames in London. The prototype Merlin #1, named Kate after the last few letters in the word 'syndicate', continues to be sailed at Ranelagh Sailing Club.Interview with Mervyn Allen (60-year member of Ranelagh Sailing Club) by Maury Shenk (Sept. 6, 2020). The second Merlin (and first production boat) is now in the collection of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall having been presented to the museum by Beecher Moore, a sailing and business partner of Jack Holt and another member of the original commissioning syndicate. The 'Rocket' class was formed in 1949 when a group of Tynemouth sailors commissioned Wyche & Coppock of Nottingham, also known for their building of the Norfolk Punt, to design a half deck 14 ft. dinghy which had more sail area, narrower decks and was lighter than the Merlin. After much debate the two classes merged in April, 1951 to form the 'Merlin Rocket Class'.

Either way, Judaism and most sects of Christianity treat Genesis as canonical scripture, and believers generally regard it as having spiritual significance. The opening chapter of Genesis tells a story of God's creation of the universe and of humankind as taking place over the course of six successive days. Some Christian and Jewish schools of thought (such as Christian fundamentalism) read these biblical passages literally, assuming each day of creation as 24 hours in duration. Others (such as Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and mainline Protestant denominations) read the story allegorically, and hold that the biblical account aims to describe humankind's relationship to creation and the creator, that Genesis 1 does not describe actual historical events, and that the six days of creation simply represents a long period of time. Genesis 2 records a second account of creation. Chapter 3 introduces a talking serpent, which many Christians believe is Satan in disguise. Many Christians in ancient times regarded the early chapters of Genesis as true both as history and as allegory.Various Interpretations of Genesis \\"The creation account is an allegory; its message is the spiritual truth contained in the allegory. This is a very old position in Christian interpretation, although until the conflict with science developed the account was usually (but not always) thought to be true both literally and allegorically.\\" Other Jews and Christians have long regarded the creation account of Genesis as an allegory - even prior to the development of modern science and the scientific accounts (based on the scientific method) of cosmological, biological and human origins. Notable proponents of allegorical interpretation include the Christian theologian Augustine of Hippo, who in the 4th century, on theological grounds, argued that God created everything in the universe in the same instant, and not in six days as a plain reading of Genesis would require; and the even earlier 1st-century Jewish scholar Philo of Alexandria, who wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days or in any determinate amount of time.Allegorical Interpretation. Interpretation Church historians on allegorical interpretation of Genesis The literalist reading of some contemporary Christians maligns the allegorical or mythical interpretation of Genesis as a belated attempt to reconcile science with the biblical account. They maintain that the story of origins had always been interpreted literally until modern science (and, specifically, biological evolution) arose and challenged it. This view is not the consensus view, however, as demonstrated below: According to Rowan Williams: \\"[For] most of the history of Christianity there's been an awareness that a belief that everything depends on the creative act of God, is quite compatible with a degree of uncertainty or latitude about how precisely that unfolds in creative time.\\" Some religious historians consider that biblical literalism came about with the rise of Protestantism; before the Reformation, the Bible was not usually interpreted in a completely literal way. Fr. Stanley Jaki, a Benedictine priest and theologian who is also a distinguished physicist, states in his Bible and Science: Adam and Eve, by Albrecht D√ºrer (1507). However, the Russian Orthodox hieromonk Fr. Seraphim Rose has argued that leading Orthodox saints such as Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian, John Chrysostom and Ephraim the Syrian believed that Genesis should be treated as a historical account. Ancient Christian interpretations Finding allegory in history Maxine Clarke Beach comments Paul's assertion in that the Genesis story of Abraham's sons is an allegory, writing that \\"This allegorical interpretation has been one of the biblical texts used in the long history of Christian anti-Semitism, which its author could not have imagined or intended\\".Use of Allegory by Early Christians Other New Testament writers took a similar approach to the Jewish Bible. The Gospel of Matthew reinterprets a number of passages. Where the prophet Hosea has God say of Israel, \\"Out of Egypt I called my son,\\" (), Matthew interprets the phrase as a reference to Jesus. Likewise, Isaiah's promise of a child as a sign to King Ahaz () is understood by Matthew to refer to Jesus. Later Christians followed their example. Irenaeus of Lyons, in his work Against Heresies from the middle of the 2nd century, saw the story of Adam, Eve and the serpent pointing to the death of Jesus: In the 3rd century, Origen and others of the Alexandrian school claimed that the Bible's true meaning could be found only by reading it allegorically. Origen explained in De Principiis that sometimes spiritual teachings could be gleaned from historical events, and sometimes the lessons could only be taught through stories that, taken literally, would \\"seem incapable of containing truth.\\"De Principiis IV.15, Origen, 3rd century. Days of creation Early Christians seem to have been divided over whether to interpret the days of creation in Genesis 1 as literal days, or to understand them allegorically. For example, St. Basil rejected an allegorical interpretation in his Hexa√´meron, without commenting on the literalism of the days: Origen of Alexandria, in a passage that was later chosen by Gregory of Nazianzus for inclusion in the Philocalia, an anthology of some of his most important texts, made the following remarks: And in another passage, writing in response to the pagan intellectual Celsus, he said: Saint Augustine, one of the most influential theologians of the Catholic Church, suggested that the Biblical text should not be interpreted literally if it contradicts what we know from science and our God-given reason. From an important passage on his \\"The Literal Interpretation of Genesis\\" (early fifth century, AD), St. Augustine wrote: St. Augustine of Hippo In the book, Augustine took the view that everything in the universe was created simultaneously by God, and not in seven days like a plain account of Genesis would require. He argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. Augustine also does not envisage original sin as originating structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of Adam and Eve were already created mortal before the Fall. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that we should be willing to change our mind about it as new information comes up. In The City of God, Augustine rejected both the immortality of the human race proposed by pagans, and contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings: However, Augustine is quoting here about the age of human civilization not the age of the Earth based on his use of early Christian histories. Those histories are no longer considered accurate in terms of exact years and therefore either the 6000 years is not a exact number or the years aren't actual literal years. St. Augustine also comments on the word \\"day\\" in the creation week, admitting the interpretation is difficult: Contemporary Christian considerations Many modern Christian theologians, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and mainline Protestants, have rejected literalistic interpretations of Genesis in favour of allegorical or mythopoietic interpretations such as the literary framework view. Many Christian Fundamentalists have considered such rejection unmerited. Sir Robert Anderson wrote, \\"Christ and Criticism\\" in The Fundamentals, which wholly rejected a non-literal interpretation of Genesis by Jesus Christ. In modern times, Answers in Genesis has been a strong advocate of a literal interpretation of Genesis. Catholic theologian Ludwig Ott in his authoritative Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, under the section \\"The Divine Work of Creation,\\" (pages 92‚Äì122) covers the \\"biblical hexahemeron\\" (the \\"six days\\" of creation), the creation of man, Adam/Eve, original sin, the Fall, and the statements of the early Fathers, Saints, Church Councils, and Popes relevant to the matter. Ott makes the following comments on the \\"science\\" of Genesis and the Fathers: Pope John Paul II wrote to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on the subject of cosmology and how to interpret Genesis: The \\"Clergy Letter\\" Project, drafted in 2004, and signed by thousands of Christian clergy supporting science and faith, states: Prominent evangelical advocates of metaphorical interpretations of Genesis include Meredith G. Kline and Henri Blocher who advocate the literary framework view. In Beyond the Firmament: Understanding Science and the Theology of Creation, evangelical author Gordon J. Glover argues for an ancient near-eastern cosmology interpretation of Genesis, which he labels the theology of creation: Rabbinic teachings Philo was the first commentator to use allegory on Bible extensively in his writing. Some medieval philosophical rationalists, such as Maimonides (Mosheh ben Maimon, the \\"Rambam\\") held that it was not required to read Genesis literally. In this view, one was obligated to understand Torah in a way that was compatible with the findings of science. Indeed, Maimonides, one of the great rabbis of the Middle Ages, wrote that if science and Torah were misaligned, it was either because science was not understood or the Torah was misinterpreted. Maimonides argued that if science proved a point, then the finding should be accepted and scripture should be interpreted accordingly.The Guide for the Perplexed 2:25 Before him Saadia Gaon set rules in the same spirit when allegoric approach can be used, for example, if the plain sense contradicts logic.Emunoth ve-Deoth, chapter 7 Solomon ibn Gabirol extensively used allegory in his book \\"Fountain of Life\\", cited by Abraham ibn Ezra.\\"Alternative commentary\\" to Gen. 3:21 In 1305 Shlomo ben Aderet wrote a letter against unrestricted usage of allegory by followers of Maimonides, like Jacob Anatoli in his book \\"Malmad ha-Talmidim\\". In spite of this Gersonides copied Maimonides' explanation the story of Adam into his commentary on Genesis, thinly veiled by extensive usage of the word \\"hint\\". The main point of Maimonides and Gersonides is that Fall of Man is not a story about one man, but about the human nature. Adam is the pure intellect, Eve is a body, and the Serpent is a fantasy that tries to trap intellect through the body.The Guide for the Perplexed 2:30 Zohar states: Nahmanides, often critical of the rationalist views of Maimonides, pointed out (in his commentary to Genesis) several non-sequiturs stemming from a literal translation of the Bible's account of Creation, and stated that the account actually symbolically refers to spiritual concepts. He quoted the Mishnah in Tractate Chagigah which states that the actual meaning of the Creation account, mystical in nature, was traditionally transmitted from teachers to advanced scholars in a private setting. Many Kabbalistic sources mention Shmitot - cosmic cycles of creation, similar to the Indian concept of yugas. Adam and Eve in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith The Bah√° º√≠ Faith adheres to an allegorical interpretation of the Adam and Eve narrative. In Some Answered Questions, 'Abdu'l-Bah√° unequivocally rejects a literal reading, instead holding that the story is a symbolic one containing \\"divine mysteries and universal meanings\\"; namely, the fall of Adam symbolizes that humanity became conscious of good and evil.Some Answered Questions: Adam and Eve.

Life George Clarke Simpson was born in Derby, England, the son of Arthur Simpson (the proprietor of a department store in East Street) and his wife, Alice Lambton Clarke. He was educated at Derby School. He then studied Science at Owens College in Manchester graduating BSc in 1900 and then doing postgraduate studies at the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1902 he visited Lapland to investigate atmospheric electricity. In 1905 he became the first person to lecture in meteorology at a British university when he was appointed lecturer at the University of Manchester. In 1906, he joined the Indian Meteorological Service as an Imperial Meteorologist at their headquarters in Simla and inspected many of the meteorological stations in India and Burma. In 1910, he and his colleague Charles Wright were the meteorologists for Robert Falcon Scott's Antarctic Terra Nova Expedition. Given the nickname 'Sunny Jim' by the other expedition members, he constructed one of the continent's first weather stations, conducting balloon experiments to test the atmosphere and determine how altitude affects temperature. Simpson recorded the temperature and wind observations at the base camp at Cape Evans. He also held command of this station for several months when Scott and his party left for the journey to the South Pole in November 1911. Returning from Antarctica in August 1912 (the outcome of the race to the South Pole was already known by then, but not the fate of Scott and the final Polar Party), Simpson went back to Simla to re- join the 'Indian Meteorological Services' which had its head office in Kolkata and its branch office in Simla. Whilst in Simla, George Simpson lived at Khud Cottage, today also known as Madan Kunj. It was here at Khud Cottage that Simpson compiled the notes he had made on the Antarctic exploration, as well as receiving the news of Scott and the Polar Party's death after it was made public following the Expedition's return to England in early 1913, which sent him into a deep depression. Khud Cottage Simla Currently this cottage belongs to Rajeev Madan, and it has been in his family since 1939. Khud Cottage was also the erstwhile residence of the Governor of Burma, during World War II when Burma was occupied by Japan. When the First World War broke out in 1914, many of the staff of the Indian Meteorologist Department were drafted for military service. From March to May 1916, Simpson had to perform army service as the meteorological adviser to the British Expeditionary Force in Mesopotamia, which now forms part of southern Iraq. Later, he was called upon to serve as Assistant Secretary to the Board of Munitions and had to leave Simla again. In 1920 he was appointed Director of the Meteorological Office, London. He went on to be its longest serving Director, retiring in 1938. During his tenure as Director, he was engaged in research work in the fields of atmospheric electricity, ionization, radioactivity and solar radiation. He investigated the causes of lightning and in 1926 established the Simpson wind force scale, a modification of the Beaufort wind force scale which is the current standard scale used worldwide; still called the Beaufort wind force scale. Simpson was knighted by King George V in 1935. When the Second World War began in 1939, Simpson was recalled from retirement into active service, and was asked to take charge of the Kew Observatory. There he continued his research work on the electrical structure of thunderstorms until 1947. Simpson was awarded honorary doctoral degrees by the universities of Manchester, Sydney and Aberdeen. Simpson died in Bristol on New Year's Day, 1 January 1965, at the age of 86. Family Simpson married Dorothy Jane Stephen, daughter of Cecil Stephen, on 23 September 1914. They had four children: Scott Simpson (1915‚Äì1981), Professor of Geology at Exeter University; Arthur Simpson (British scientist specialised in the study of plants and sea animals); Oliver Simpson (a National Physical Laboratory physicist); and Jean Simpson, a medical doctor.

Her mother was a social reformer and novelist. When Hester Pinsent was a teenager, both of her brothers, David and Richard, died in World War I. Pinsent attended Somerville College, Oxford from 1919 to 1922, graduating with second-class honours in modern history.  Career  Hester Adrian lived in Cambridge as the wife of a professor, and a social hostess of the university, welcoming distinguished guests to Trinity College with her husband. She was also active as a volunteer in the Cambridge community. In 1936, she became a justice of the peace in Cambridge. During World War II, she worked for the Women's Voluntary Service in Cambridge, as a billeting officer. She took particular interest in the lives of children in crisis, and after the war she chaired the juvenile panel of the Cambridge magistrates' courts from 1949 to 1958. She joined the management committee of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology, and in 1959 became president of the Howard League for Penal Reform. Adrian was also active in mental health and special education organizations. She was honorary secretary of the Cambridgeshire Mental Welfare Association from 1924 to 1934.

The distinguishing feature of LQC is the prominent role played by the quantum geometry effects of loop quantum gravity (LQG). In particular, quantum geometry creates a brand new repulsive force which is totally negligible at low space-time curvature but rises very rapidly in the Planck regime, overwhelming the classical gravitational attraction and thereby resolving singularities of general relativity. Once singularities are resolved, the conceptual paradigm of cosmology changes and one has to revisit many of the standard issues‚Äîe.g., the \\"horizon problem\\"‚Äîfrom a new perspective. Since LQG is based on a specific quantum theory of Riemannian geometry, geometric observables display a fundamental discreteness that play a key role in quantum dynamics: While predictions of LQC are very close to those of quantum geometrodynamics (QGD) away from the Planck regime, there is a dramatic difference once densities and curvatures enter the Planck scale. In LQC the Big Bang is replaced by a quantum bounce. Study of LQC has led to many successes, including the emergence of a possible mechanism for cosmic inflation, resolution of gravitational singularities, as well as the development of effective semi-classical Hamiltonians. This subfield originated in 1999 by Martin Bojowald, and further developed in particular by Abhay Ashtekar and Jerzy Lewandowski, as well as Tomasz Paw≈Çowski and Parampreet Singh, et al. In late 2012 LQC represents a very active field in physics, with about three hundred papers on the subject published in the literature. There has also recently been work by Carlo Rovelli, et al. on relating LQC to the spinfoam-based spinfoam cosmology. However, the results obtained in LQC are subject to the usual restriction that a truncated classical theory, then quantized, might not display the true behaviour of the full theory due to artificial suppression of degrees of freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations in the full theory. It has been argued that singularity avoidance in LQC are by mechanisms only available in these restrictive models and that singularity avoidance in the full theory can still be obtained but by a more subtle feature of LQG.On (Cosmological) Singularity Avoidance in Loop Quantum Gravity, Johannes Brunnemann, Thomas Thiemann, Class. Quantum Grav. 23 (2006) 1395-1428.Unboundedness of Triad -- Like Operators in Loop Quantum Gravity, Johannes Brunnemann, Thomas Thiemann, Class. Quantum Grav. 23 (2006) 1429-1484. Due to the quantum geometry, the Big Bang is replaced by a big bounce without any assumptions on the matter content or any fine tuning. An important feature of loop quantum cosmology is the effective space-time description of the underlying quantum evolution. The effective dynamics approach has been extensively used in loop quantum cosmology to describe physics at the Planck scale and the very early universe. Rigorous numerical simulations have confirmed the validity of the effective dynamics, which provides an excellent approximation to the full loop quantum dynamics. It has been shown that only when the states have very large quantum fluctuations at late times, which means that they do not lead to macroscopic universes as described by general relativity, that the effective dynamics has departures from the quantum dynamics near bounce and the subsequent evolution. In such a case, the effective dynamics overestimates the density at the bounce, but still captures the qualitative aspects extremely well.

The image is reversed; it was his right hand that was branded. Jonathan Walker (1799 ‚Äì May 1, 1878), known as \\"The Man with the Branded Hand\\", was an American reformer who became a national hero in 1844 when he was trialed and sentenced as a slave stealer following his attempt to help seven runaway slaves find freedom. He was branded on his hand by the United States Government with the markings \\"S S\\", for \\"Slave Stealer\\". Biography Jonathan Walker was born in Harwich, Massachusetts. During his youth in Massachusetts, Walker learned to sail and became captain of a fishing vessel. In early 1837, he went to Florida and became a railroad contractor. The condition of the slaves interested him, and in 1844 Walker aided several of them as they attempted to make escape in an open boat from the coast of Florida to the British West Indies, where slavery had been abolished ten years before. After doubling the capes, Captain Walker fell seriously ill; the crew, being ignorant of navigation, would all have been drowned if a wrecking sloop had not rescued them and taken Walker to Key West. From there, he was sent in chains aboard to Pensacola, where he was put in prison, chained to the floor, and deprived of light and proper food. Walker later wrote about the degrading conditions inside the jailhouse and the brutality shown toward slaves there. Put on trial in federal court in Pensacola, Walker was convicted, sentenced to be tied to a pillory\\", and publicly branded on his right hand with the letters \\"S S\\" for \\"slave stealer\\". He was also imprisoned and heavily fined. But to some it meant \\"slave savior\\". United States Marshal Eben Dorr, who also traded slaves, executed the branding with a hot iron. Walker was then returned to jail, confined eleven months, and released only after northern abolitionists paid his fine. For five years after his release, Walker lectured on slavery in the northern and western states. For instance, in 1847/48 he was on a four- and-a-half-month lecture tour together with John S. Jacobs. He lived in Wisconsin in 1855 and 1860 United States Census, 1860; State of Wisconsin, County of Sheboygan, Town of Lindon, page 51, lines 4-10 near Winooski, Wisconsin. He moved to Michigan around 1866 and lived near Muskegon. Jonathan Walker died on May 1, 1878 in Lake Harbor near Norton Shores, Michigan. He is buried with his wife, who predeceased him by seven years, at Evergreen Cemetery in Muskegon. Their two youngest sons (born in 1843 and 1848) predeceased their parents, but two sons and five daughters survived both parents. A monument was erected to Captain Walker's memory on August 1, 1878. Walker was the subject of John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \\"The Branded Hand\\". Whittier heard about Walker after reading a book about him called Trial and Imprisonment of Jonathan Walker. The poem praised Walker's actions.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 264. A plaque commemorating Walker was erected on the lawn next to the Harwich, Massachusetts Historical Society. Another Rev.

It is a member of the tigliane family of diterpenes. Phorbol was first isolated in 1934 as the hydrolysis product of croton oil, which is derived from the seeds of the purging croton, Croton tiglium. The structure of phorbol was determined in 1967. Various esters of phorbol have important biological properties, the most notable of which is the capacity to act as tumor promoters through activation of protein kinase C. They mimic diacylglycerols, glycerol derivatives in which two hydroxyl groups have reacted with fatty acids to form esters. The most common and potent phorbol ester is 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), also called phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), which is used as a biomedical research tool in contexts such as models of carcinogenesis. History and source Phorbol is a natural product found in many plants, especially those of the Euphorbiaceae and Thymelaeaceae families. Phorbol is the active constituent of the highly toxic New World tropical manchineel or beach apple, Hippomane mancinella. It is very soluble in most polar organic solvents, as well as in water. In the manchineel, this leads to an additional exposure risk during rain, where liquid splashing from an undamaged tree may also be injurious. Contact with the tree or consumption of its fruit can lead to symptoms such as severe pain and swelling. Another plant of particular note is the purging croton, Croton tiglium, the source of croton oil from which phorbol was initially isolated. The seeds and oil of C. tiglium have been used for hundreds of years in traditional medicine, generally as a purgative. The seeds have been mentioned in Chinese herbal texts as early as 2000 years ago. The purgative effects of the oil are largely attributed to the high percentage of phorbol esters contained in the oil. Although products derived from the croton plant have been used for thousands of years, phorbol was only isolated from C. tiglium seeds in 1934. The structure of the compound was determined in 1967, and a total synthesis was described in 2015.. Mechanism of action Phorbol derivatives work primarily by interacting with protein kinase C (PKC), although they can interact with other phospholipid membrane receptors. The esters bind to PKC in a similar way to its natural ligand, diacylglycerol, and activate the kinase. Diacylglycerol is degraded quickly by the body, allowing PKC to be reversibly activated. When phorbol esters bind to the receptor, they are not degraded as efficiently by the body, leading to constitutively active PK. PKC is involved in a number of important cell signaling pathways. Thus, phorbol ester exposure can show a wide range of results. Example of phorbol bound to a domain of protein kinase C The main results of phorbol exposure are tumor promotion and inflammatory response. Although phorbol is not a carcinogen itself, it greatly enhances the action of other substances and promotes tumor proliferation. PKC is a key component in biological pathways controlling cell growth and differentiation. When phorbol esters bind to PKC, cell proliferation pathways are activated. This effect greatly promotes tumors when the cells are exposed to even a sub-carcinogenic amount of a substance. PKC is also involved in activation of inflammation pathways such as the NF-Œ∫B pathway. Thus, exposure to phorbol products can induce an inflammatory response in tissues. Symptoms can include edema and pain, especially to the skin and mucus membranes. While phorbol itself does not have irritant activity, nearly all phorbol esters are highly irritant, with a wide range of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. The median lethal dose (LD50) of phorbol esters for male mice was found to be about 27 mg/kg, with the mice showing hemorrhage and congestion of pulmonary blood vessels, as well as lesions throughout the body. Total synthesis A total synthesis of enantiopure phorbol was developed in 2015. While this synthesis will not replace natural isolation products, it will enable researchers to create phorbol analogs for use in research, especially creating phorbol derivatives that can be evaluated for anti-cancer activity. Previously, the difficulty with synthesizing phorbol had been creating C‚ÄìC bonds, especially in the six- membered ring at the top of the molecule. This synthesis starts from (+)-3-carene, and uses a series of 19 steps to eventually create (+)-phorbol. :Overview of the complete synthesis of (+)-phorbol starting with (+)-3-carene Uses in biomedical research and treatments Because of their mechanism of action, phorbol esters can be used to study tumor proliferation and pain response. TPA is most commonly used in the laboratory to induce a cellular response. For example, TPA can be used to measure response to pain and test compounds that may mitigate the inflammatory response. TPA and other phorbol esters can also be used to induce tumor formation and elucidate its mechanism. Some phorbol esters such as tigilanol tiglate have shown anti-cancer activities and can potentially be used as a defense against certain viruses and bacteria. TPA, together with ionomycin, can also be used to stimulate T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production, and is used in protocols for intracellular staining of these cytokines. Phorbol, in the form of croton oil, is also in folk medicine as a purgative, counter-irritant, or anthelmintic.

However, the core Jaguar XJ and XK ranges remained on the site until they were moved to Castle Bromwich in 2005. Subsequently, the Browns Lane site housed just the headquarters and museum as well as 500 staff responsible for wood veneering for Jaguar, Aston Martin, and Land Rover. Later, the headquarters moved to the Whitley plant, Whitley, Coventry but the Wood Shop (Veneer Manufacturing Centre), Museum and Pilot Build Workshop remained at Browns Lane. Australian property firm Macquarie Goodman announced its purchase of Browns Lane in 2007. The assembly halls were demolished in late 2008.

He is remembered for his contribution to Christian higher education in the United States not only by teaching and building the philosophy department at Wheaton, but also by writing influential books and articles about the philosophy of Christian education, participating in the creation of the Society of Christian Philosophers, and encouraging his students to go on for graduate study and become academic leaders in their own rights. Wheaton College President Philip Ryken said \\"It would be hard to think of anyone who has had a greater impact on Christian higher education than Arthur Holmes.\\" Holmes died in Wheaton, Illinois, on October 8, 2011, at age 87.  Education and career at Wheaton College  A native of Dover, England, Holmes came to the United States in 1947 after serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II. He earned a bachelor's degree (1950) and a master's degree (1952) in Bible and theology from Wheaton College and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Northwestern University in Chicago (1957). Holmes began teaching at his alma mater while still pursuing his graduate degrees and remained there for his entire 43-year career. He was instrumental in convincing the college to establish a philosophy department independent of the Bible and theology division, and he served as the chair of that department for more than two decades. He started the annual Wheaton Philosophy Conference in 1954, which eventually led to the creation of the Society of Christian Philosophers in 1978. He was especially well known as a teacher for the year- long history of philosophy sequence that was a foundational course in the philosophy major, which Wheaton College made available online in 2015. Holmes retired in 1994 and was named Professor Emeritus, but continued to teach occasionally even after his retirement.  Honors and awards  * Wheaton College Teacher of the Year, 1966 * Wheaton College Alumnus of the Year for Distinguished Service to Alma Mater, 1978 * Wheaton College Teacher of the Year, 1983 * Illinois Professor of the Year, 1987 (Council for Advancement and Support of Education) * Professor of the Year with highest honors, 1994 (All- Professor Team, The Chicago Tribune) * Mark O. Hatfield Leadership Award, 1998 (Coalition for Christian Colleges and Universities) In 1998, the Arthur F. Holmes Chair of Faith and Learning was established at Wheaton College in his honor, supporting and honoring the work of scholars in philosophy, history, or English who have given particular attention to one of the major themes of Holmes' academic career: the integration of faith and learning. Holmes also served as a guest lecturer at many colleges, universities, and conferences. He received two honorary doctoral degrees. Notable students Holmes' colleagues and students recall his \\"grand vision\\" for the Wheaton College philosophy department: that it would produce 100 graduates who would go on to earn Ph.D.s in philosophy. Several years after Holmes' death, former student Clifford Williams decided to investigate whether that ambition had been achieved. He was able to identify at least 116 of Holmes' former students who had earned doctorates in philosophy. In addition, many of Holmes' former students pursued advanced study in other fields, such as history, literature, and Biblical studies. Another former student, C. Stephen Evans, noted in his eulogy of Holmes that \\"Many of the brightest Christian scholars in many fields ... were transformed by being Art's students.

The system of subsidy applies throughout the European Union according to rules agreed between the member states. However, exact details of implementation and grants vary from country to country within the outline rules. Transitional rules also apply for new member states which joined the EU in 2004 and more recently. States have a choice of whether to introduce the new scheme at once, or to phase it in over a period from 2005 to 2013. The UK Government decided to be one of the first countries in Europe to introduce the Single Payment Scheme and decided to start to phase it in from 2005. Introduction in the UK was strategically coordinated via DEFRA, with devolved responsibility to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to independently implement the scheme. The new scheme was intended to change the way the EU supported its farm sector by removing the link between subsidies and production of specific crops. This reform focused on consumers and taxpayers, while giving farmers the freedom to produce what the market wanted. Member States have the choice to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production to avoid abandonment of particular production. Current payments to farmers continue to reflect historic patterns of production for different crops in countries where the scheme has yet to be introduced, or as a proportion of the total payment where the scheme is being introduced over a period of years. The Single Farm Payment is linked to meeting environmental, public, animal and plant health and animal welfare standards and the need to keep land in good agricultural and environmental condition. History It was an intention of the scheme to 'decouple' grant payments from production. This was in response to criticism from other World Trade Organization (WTO) countries (mainly the US), that the EU was unfairly subsidising farmers and providing an unfair competitive advantage. Under the SPS the farmer is no longer paid different amounts according to the crop he or she produces, but a set amount per hectare of agricultural land maintained in cultivatable condition. The intention is that choice of crop is based purely on market driven forces and not on production based grants. Decoupling of payments has allowed them to be categorised under the so-called blue box for the purpose of WTO negotiations, ensuring the legality and compliance of international obligations. To gain funds from the SPS the Farmer has to cross comply ‚Äì that is, to farm in an environmentally friendly way, with careful use of pesticides and fertilisers. The farmer also had to set aside (not farm) 8% of their productive land annually, in addition two metres on the perimeter of each field must be left uncropped to become overgrown. However, the requirement for set aside was suspended for one year in Autumn 2007 following sharp increases in prices for certain crops, and in consideration of the aim to grow more crops for biofuel production. Another stated goal at the outset was to simplify the existing process including applications. Eleven existing schemes were replaced by the SPS. Implementation of the payments in England has been impaired by problems at the Rural Payments Agency. Payments under the scheme were intended to be made by around January 2006, but by December 2006 some 2% of claims still remained unsettled. Payments amounted to ¬£1.5 billion distributed amongst 115,000 claimants, though most of the money went to relatively few of the claimants (according to the size of their holdings). Difficulties in implementation included double the number of expected claimants, as rules of the new scheme allowed many more people with relatively small areas of land to claim. Applications are made annually by completion of the SP5 form, which requires claimants to declare all the land under their control, the land they wish to claim payment on and whether they are subject to Statutory Management Requirements (SMR)Cross Compliance Statutory Management Requirements or Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC).Cross Compliance Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions In February 2008 RPA began accepting electronic applications via third party software. The first application was submitted 27 February 2008 through Single Payment Supervisor by Paul Holliday Software. Following the success of the project to accept electronic applications via third party software RPA took the next logical step and in March 2010 began allowing submissions directly through their own Whole Farm Approach website. There is speculation within the agricultural industry that paper forms will be withdrawn in an attempt to reduce costs. The scheme replaced eleven previous subsidy schemes which were based on the production of crops and/or livestock e.g. dairy premium and arable area payments scheme. Initially the payments had a bias towards paying producers who historically received the highest subsidies. The payment bias works on a sliding scale with a move away from historic payments towards land based payments with payments in 2012 having no historic element. Implementation of the Single Payment Scheme in Wales was the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government. Payments totaling ¬£250m were paid to more than 98% of eligible farmers between 1 December 2005 and 30 June 2006, including ¬£110m to about 75% of Welsh farmers on the first possible day, which made them amongst the first in Europe to receive the new payment. Scheme details The Single Payment Scheme (SPS) rewards farmers for managing their land to minimum (\\"Cross Compliance\\") standards for crop production, animal welfare and the environment. Farmers can submit a claim annually by declaring (1) all of the agricultural parcels (crops) on their farm and (2) their payment entitlements for activation. The farmer's declaration of her payment entitlements for activation is the farmer's request for a 'Single Payment'. The farmer is paid against her declared payment entitlements that are each matched against an eligible hectare of declared land ('activated for payment'). The 'Area Declared' for Single Payment is respective; meaning that it relates to the two factors of (1) declared agricultural parcels and (2) payment entitlements declared for activation. By way of example: A farmer holds 102.00 payment entitlements. The farmer declares all of his agricultural parcels that total exactly 100.00 eligible hectares. If the farmer declares 102.00 of his payment entitlements for activation, the 'Area Declared' for Single Payment would be 100.00 hectares (the lower of the eligible hectares declared and the payment entitlements declared for activation). If the farmer declares 98.00 of his payment entitlements for activation, the 'Area Declared' for Single Payment would be 98.00 hectares (the lower of the eligible hectares declared and the payment entitlements declared for activation).

While the RBE2 uses a passive electronically scanned array (PESA) the RBE2-AA radar system is an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar system derived from the Rafale's RBE2 radar. It replaces the mechanically steered array antenna by electronically steering exerted by up to several thousand of transmit-receive modules which enable maximum performance and versatility as well as enhanced reliability. The improved RBE2-AA radar system is available since 2012 for the Rafale fighter-aircraft owned by the French Air Force, Navy and export customers. In April 2002, the French weaponry procurement agency (DGA) awarded Thales a contract to develop an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar demonstrator based on the RBE2 radar system. The RBE2-AA (active array) variant has been tested on a Myst√®re 20, a Mirage 2000 testbed aircraft from the Flight Test Center of the DGA (D√©l√©gation G√©n√©rale pour l'Armement, the French procurement agency) and then on a Rafale. While the first tests were made with US-made transmitter- receivers, the current radar features parts manufactured by Thales. The radar is using about 838 GaAs T/R modules. In July 2004, DGA awarded a 90 million- euro contract for the development of a second active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar demonstrator aimed at fielding this new technology on French Rafales beginning in 2012.

Note the increased central pallor of the red blood cells. Hypochromic anemia is a generic term for any type of anemia in which the red blood cells are paler than normal. (Hypo- refers to less, and chromic means colour.) A normal red blood cell has a biconcave disk shape and will have an area of pallor in its center when viewed microscopically. In hypochromic cells, this area of central pallor is increased. This decrease in redness is due to a disproportionate reduction of red cell hemoglobin (the pigment that imparts the red color) in proportion to the volume of the cell. Clinically the color can be evaluated by the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The MCHC is considered the better parameter of the two as it adjusts for effect the size of the cell has on its amount of hemoglobin. } Hypochromia is clinically defined as below the normal MCH reference range of 27‚Äì33 picograms/cell in adults or below the normal MCHC reference range of 33‚Äì36 g/dL in adults.} Red blood cells will also be small (microcytic), leading to substantial overlap with the category of microcytic anemia. The most common causes of this kind of anemia are iron deficiency and thalassemia. Hypochromic anemia was historically known as chlorosis or green sickness for the distinct skin tinge sometimes present in patients, in addition to more general symptoms such as a lack of energy, shortness of breath, dyspepsia, headaches, a capricious or scanty appetite and amenorrhea. Historical understanding In 1554, German physician Johannes Lange described a condition, which he called \\"the disease of virgins\\" because, he said, it was \\"peculiar to virgins\\". The symptoms were wide-ranging, including an appearance which is \\"pale, as if bloodless\\", an aversion to food (especially meat), difficulty in breathing, palpitations and swollen ankles. He prescribed that sufferers should \\"live with men and copulate. If they conceive, they will recover.\\" The symptom picture overlaps to some extent with an earlier condition described in English medical texts, \\"the green sickness\\", which was a form of jaundice. However, Lange shifted the cause from digestive errors to the sufferer remaining a virgin, despite being of the age for marriage. The name \\"chlorosis\\" was coined in 1615 by Montpellier professor of medicine Jean Varandal from the ancient Greek word \\"chloros\\" meaning \\"greenish-yellow\\", \\"pale green\\", \\"pale\\", \\"pallid\\" or \\"fresh\\". Both Lange and Varandal claimed Hippocrates as a reference, but their lists of symptoms do not match that in the Hippocratic Disease of Virgins, a treatise that was translated into Latin in the 1520s and thus became available to early modern Europe. In addition to \\"green sickness\\", the condition was known as morbus virgineus (\\"virgin's disease\\") or febris amatoria (\\"lover's fever\\"). Francis Grose' 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue defined \\"green sickness\\" as: \\"The disease of maids occasioned by celibacy.\\"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue by Francis Grose In 1681, English physician Thomas Sydenham classified chlorosis as a hysterical disease affecting not only adolescent girls but also \\"slender and weakly women that seem consumptive.\\" He advocated iron as a treatment: \\"To the worn out or languid blood it gives a spur or fillip whereby the animal spirits which lay prostrate and sunken under their own weight are raised and excited\\". Daniel Turner in 1714 preferred to term chlorosis \\"the Pale or White Sickness ... since in its worst State the Complexion is rarely or ever a true Green, tho' bordering on that Hue\\". He went on to describe it as \\"an ill Habit of Body, arising either from Obstructions, particularly of the menstrual Purgation, or from a Congestion of crude Humours in the Viscera, vitiating the Ferments of the Bowels, especially those of Concoction, and placing therein a depraved Appetite of Things directly preternatural, as Chalk, Cinders, Earth, Sand, &c;\\". One of his case studies was that of an 11-year-old girl who was found, on investigation, to have been eating large quantities of coal. Chlorosis is briefly mentioned in Casanova's Histoire de ma vie: \\"I do not know, but we have some physicians who say that chlorosis in girls is the result of that pleasure onanism indulged in to excess\\". In 1841, the Bohemian doctor and pharmacist Albert Popper published a treatment for Chlorosis containing Vitriolum martis (sulfuric acid and iron) and Sal tartari (potassium carbonate) in √ñsterreichische medicinische Wochenschrift which was republished and refined in the following years. In 1845, the French writer Auguste Saint-Arroman gave a recipe for a treatment by medicinal chocolate that included iron filings in his De L'action du caf√©, du th√© et du chocolat sur la sant√©, et de leur influence sur l'intelligence et le moral de l'hommeLouis E. Grivetti, \\"From Aphrodisiac to Health Food: A Cultural History of Chocolate\\" Karger Gazette 6 no. 68. and in 1872, French physician Armand Trousseau also advocated treatment with iron, although he still classified chlorosis as a \\"nervous disease\\".Disease of Virgins; Green Sickness, Chlorosis and the Problems of Puberty by Helen KingThe appetite as a voice, by Joan Brumberg, pages. 164-165. In 1887, physician Sir Andrew Clark of London Hospital proposed a physiological cause for chlorosis, tying its onset to the demands placed on the bodies of adolescent girls by growth and menarche. In 1891, Frank Wedekind's play Spring Awakening referenced the disease. In 1895, University of Edinburgh pathologist Prof Ralph Stockman built upon experiments demonstrating that inorganic iron contributed to hemoglobin synthesis to show that chlorosis could be explained by a deficiency in iron brought on by loss of menstrual blood and an inadequate diet. Despite the work of Stockman and the effectiveness of iron in treating the symptoms of chlorosis, debate about its cause continued into the 1930s. A character in T. C. Boyle's The Road to Wellville suffers from chlorosis, and the narrator describes her green skin and black lips. In 1936, Arthur J. Patek and Clark W. Heath of Harvard Medical School concluded that chlorosis was identical to hypochromic anemia. More recently, some people have suggested that it may have been endometriosis, but the historical descriptions cannot easily be mapped on to this condition. Acquired forms Hypochromic anemia may be caused by vitamin B6 deficiency from a low iron intake, diminished iron absorption, or excessive iron loss. It can also be caused by infections (e.g. hookworms) or other diseases (i.e. anemia of chronic disease), therapeutic drugs, copper toxicity, and lead poisoning. One acquired form of anemia is also known as Faber's syndrome. It may also occur from severe stomach or intestinal bleeding caused by ulcers or medications such as aspirin or bleeding from hemorrhoids.Miale JB (1982). Laboratory Medicine: Hematology. (6th ed.) The CV Mosby Company, St. Louis Hereditary forms Hypochromic anemia occurs in patients with hypochromic microcytic anemia with iron overload. The condition is autosomal recessive and is caused by mutations in the SLC11A2 gene. The condition prevents red blood cells from accessing iron in the blood, which causes anemia that is apparent at birth. It can lead to pallor, fatigue, and slow growth. The iron overload aspect of the disorder means that the iron accumulates in the liver and can cause liver impairment in adolescence or early adulthood. It also occurs in patients with hereditary iron refractory iron-deficiency anemia (IRIDA). Patients with IRIDA have very low serum iron and transferrin saturation, but their serum ferritin is normal or high. The anemia is usually moderate in severity and presents later in childhood. Hypochromic anemia is also caused by thalassemia and congenital disorders like Benjamin anemia.

Solutions with a baricity less than 0.999 are termed hypobaric, and are usually created by mixing the local anesthetic with distilled water. Hyperbaric solutions are created by mixing dextrose 5-8% with the desired local anesthetic. Hyperbaric solutions will flow in the direction of gravity and settle in the most dependent areas of the intrathecal space. Conversely, hypobaric mixtures will rise in relation to gravitational pull.

She was a Quaker by confession, though she had been raised a Methodist. Ripley traveled thousands of miles in both the United States and Britain on the camp meeting circuit. She was an effective evangelist. Ripley also ministered to many of the disenfranchised, including the Oneida people, men and women in prison, and especially African slaves in the American South. She was self-published six times, with three of her books receiving a second printing. Ripley crossed the Atlantic at least 9 times, most of those times traveling alone. At her death, one newspaper wrote in her obituary that she was ‚Äúperhaps the most extraordinary woman in the world.‚ÄùChristian Advocate and Journal and Zion‚Äôs Herald , Feb. 10, 1832 Early life Ripley was born in Whitby. Her father, William was a close associate of John Wesley. Wesley called William \\"a burning and shining light.\\" William was working with Wesley at a time when Wesley was encouraging women to become preachers. William desired that his child was going to be a preacher, even before he knew her gender. He encouraged her toward that vocation for as long as he was alive. Ripley's father died in her teen years, leaving the family in difficult financial straits. They suffered a number of other setbacks, including the loss of family members to early death, and a landslide which destroyed their family home. These incidents had a profound impact on her. Believing that she was called to Christian ministry, and not wanting to be tied down by the responsibilities of marriage, Ripley chose to remain unmarried. Work as an Evangelist Dorothy traveled, engaging in itinerant preaching in the United States. She spent a great deal of time in New York, South Carolina and Georgia. Ripley faced many challenges, including the hostility of both men and women toward female preachers. She was accused of being a lewd woman for allowing herself to be viewed publicly as a spectacle. A few of Ripley's opponents also accused her of prostituting herself, as she did not have an income as a means of regular support; her first years as a missionary were funded entirely by donations from people who believed in her ministry. This practice explains the title of her second book, The Bank of Faith and Works United. Ripley persevered, and often ended up winning over her opponents through the effect of her preaching upon large crowds. Ripley felt sympathy from childhood for the slaves in America. On arriving in 1801 for her first trip in America, she gained an audience with Thomas Jefferson in order to ask for his permission to minister to slaves, preach to slave owners, and to found a school to educate freed slaves. During the meeting she rebuked the President for his slave ownership. She declared that she was particularly concerned for the African women who were being exploited by their slave owners. She secured the \\"approbation\\" of the President for her work. When in the South she ministered directly to African slaves, and told slave-owners that they ought to give up their slaves. Ripley also preached in many African- American churches. She preached for Rev. Absalom Jones' church on one occasion, and for Rev. Richard Allen on another. Allen had been very hesitant to permit Ripley to preach at his church in 1802, but was convinced by some of his members to allow her to do so. Later, Ripley would be one of the speakers, with Rev. Allen and several other male preachers, in 1818. It is quite possible that with Ripley's example before him, Rev. Allen felt comfortable ordaining Jarena Lee in 1819. In January 1806, Ripley preached at a church service held inside the United States Capitol building. She was the first woman to do so, and only one other woman received this honor (Harriet Livermore). The event was attended by President Thomas Jefferson. Ripley assisted Hugh Bourne in starting Primitive Methodism. With Lorenzo Dow and Bourne she preached an itinerant circuit in England. The revival services these three conducted brought many people into Primitive Methodist circles. In 1830 Ripley led a revival that featured three other female preachers, including Watkins, Nancy Towle and Ann Rexford. Relationship with the Quakers Attracted to the Quakers, Ripley began to attend their meetings. She identified closely with their doctrine of inner guidance by the light. Ripley loved the Society of Friends, but that love was not always mutual. She applied for membership with them three times, but they repeatedly refused. Several Friends privately supported Ripley financially, believing she was legitimately called by God to preach. David Sands and Priscilla Hanna Gurney were notable Quakers who gave Ripley a great deal of personal and practical support. Relationship with the Methodists Ripley was raised as a Methodist, and most of her theological understanding reflected that background. Ripley was exposed to many famous Methodists in her early life. Her father hosted John Wesley at his house on several occasions. With him came his traveling group of women preachers, including Sarah Crosby and Mary Bosanquet. Ripley also met Bishop Francis Asbury who greatly encouraged her in her preaching. She associated with many other famous Methodists, including Bishop Whatcoat, Ruth Watkins and Hugh Bourne. Ripley also traveled extensively with Lorenzo Dow while doing a preaching tour in Britain with Bourne. That tour included a stay in a prison for a night when she and the eccentric Dow were arrested. Publishing career Ripley published five books:The Extraordinary Conversion and Religious Experience of Dorothy Ripley (1810); The Bank of Faith and Works United (1819); An Account of Rose Butler (1819); Letters Addressed to Dorothy RIpley (1807), which included a book of poems called An Address to All Difficulties; and the memoir and collected notes of her father. She published all of these at her own expense. The first three received a second printing. Ripley used the proceeds to fund her continued itinerant preaching ministry.

First appearing as a weekly newspaper under various names as early as 1808 and eventually as the Clarksville Chronicle, the current name is the result of a subsequent merger, in 1890, with the Tobacco Leaf, named for the area's predominant agricultural crop. (See Goodspeed's History of Tennessee, pg. 817) The Leaf-Chronicle is published daily in Clarksville, Tennessee. The Leaf-Chronicle achievement that has perhaps received the greatest acclaim in recent years is its continuing to publish every day after downtown Clarksville and its printing plant received a direct hit from a powerful tornado in January 1999. History In 1808, The Clarksville Chronicle newspaper started publication. However, no editions earlier than 1811 seem to be extant today. Later, The Tobacco Leaf appeared as a result of the area's reputation as a center for tobacco growing and shipping. Early newspapers started out as four-page journals devoted to political news and advertising. Eventually they grew to become full-fledged publications that featured more news and community information, in addition to having opinion pages with political views. In 1890, The Clarksville Chronicle merged with The Tobacco Leaf, forming The Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle. In the 1970s, the city's name was dropped as the coverage area increased, shortening the title of the current newspaper to The Leaf-Chronicle. Throughout the city's history, other newspapers such as The New Herald (an African-American newspaper), The Clarksville-Jeffersonian, and The Clarksville Star competed with The Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle, but they are all now defunct. In December 1995, The Leaf-Chronicle became part of the Gannett Newspaper Division. The offices of The Leaf-Chronicle were severely damaged in the January 22, 1999 tornado; however, the paper was still released the following day, after then publisher F. Gene Washer took editors and reporters into his home to gather news and used the Kentucky New Era's printing press in Hopkinsville. The Saturday edition of The Leaf Chronicle was a complete newspaper that featured eight pages of tornado coverage. Within four days, the staff was able to print from the downtown newspaper press, only slightly damaged. The departments worked out of an empty grocery store for eight months, until the main offices were rebuilt and reopened in the fall of 1999. Washer retired in 2008 and remains the newspaper's publisher emeritus. He was replaced by Andrew Oppmann, also publisher of Murfreesboro's Daily News Journal. Also in 2008, the newspaper consolidated its printing and production operations with its sister newspaper, The Tennessean in Nashville. Oppmann departed from both Gannett papers in late 2010.

CR 19 intersects with Cummings Road, where it bends northeast and comes within of the Neversink. Still known as Claryville Road, CR 19 continues northeast, running alongside the Neversink River, where it passes a dirt road bridge over the river. A short distance after, CR 19 intersects with Hunter Road, which also crosses over the Neversink nearby. The route soon parallels the winding river north into the hamlet of Claryville, becoming a two-lane residential street through the hamlet. After passing the Claryville Reformed Church and its namesake cemetery, CR 19 intersects with the southern terminus of CR 157 (Frost Valley Road). CR 157 proceeds west across the Neversink River as a two-lane rural street north of Claryville. CR 157 continues north for a short distance alongside the West Branch of the Neversink before crossing the county line into Ulster County.  Ulster County  After crossing the county line, Sullivan CR 157 becomes Ulster CR 47, but retains the Frost Valley Road moniker in the town of Denning. CR 47 proceeds north through Denning alongside the West Branch in spurts. The route bends with the river in multiple directions before maintaining a northeastern pattern through the town of Denning. Running along the base of a mountain, CR 47 enters a small section of non-dense woods, with several buildings through the hamlet of Frost Valley. After passing the Frost Valley YMCA, CR 47 leaves the hamlet. Returning to the dense woods of the town of Denning, CR 47, bends northeast, then southeast then east as it crosses alongside the West Branch.

After a dart to the north, CR 47 bends east and enters a large hairpin turn, where it begins a descent alongside the Esopus Creek. After the hairpin turn, CR 47 proceeds westward, crossing over Cascade Brook and the Stephen F. Fischer Memorial Cascade Brooke Bridge, opened in May 2012 after the previous culvert bridge was destroyed by Hurricane Irene in 2011. After the Stephen F. Fischer Memorial Cascade Brooke Bridge, CR 47 continues west through Shandaken, passing several residences before turning northward near Valley View Road.

Residences become more sporadic as NY 42 continues northward through Lexington, crossing under the power lines before bending northward through the dense woods of Halcott Mountain and Deep Notch, soon bending northeast into a large field area, where it enters the hamlet of West Kill. In West Kill, NY 42 intersects with the western terminus of CR 6 (Spruceton Road). NY 42 through West Kill consists of several residences along both sides of the highway before crossing over the namesake kill and bending northwest out of the hamlet. While running east of West Kill, NY 42 remains a two-lane residential roadway, crossing over the waterway once again and intersecting with Beechridge Road North. At Beechridge Road North, NY 42 bends northeast along runs west of the West Kill before bending southeast into the hamlet of Lexington. In Lexington, NY 42 is a two-lane residential street that soon runs along Schoharie Creek through downtown. The two-lane street continues southeast until an intersection with Rappleyea Road, where NY 42 crosses the creek and intersects with the terminus of CR 13A. After CR 13A, NY 42 bends southeast then northeast through downtown Lexington and intersects with NY 23A. This junction serves as the northern terminus of the northern segment of NY 42, while the right-of-way continues north as CR 13 through the Catskill Park. History When NY 42 was originally assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it was a continuous route extending along a previously unnumbered roadway from Port Jervis in the south to Lexington in the north via Monticello, Neversink, and Shandaken. The section of NY 42 between Neversink and Shandaken was eliminated due to its low traffic volume and maintenance difficulties arising from the road's high elevation and exposure to severe winter weather. Even today the portion in Ulster County is visibly affected by these conditions.

She has written ten books, both fiction and nonfiction. She holds a Ph.D. in philosophy of science from Princeton University and is sometimes grouped with novelists such as Richard Powers and Alan Lightman, who create fiction that is knowledgeable of, and sympathetic toward, science. In her three nonfiction works she has shown an affinity for philosophical rationalism, as well as a conviction that philosophy, like science, makes progress and that scientific progress is itself supported by philosophical arguments. She has also stressed the role that secular philosophical reason has made in moral advances. Increasingly, in her talks and interviews, she has been exploring what she has called \\"mattering theory\\" as an alternative to traditional utilitarianism. This theory is a continuation of her idea of \\"the mattering map\\", first suggested in her novel The Mind‚ÄìBody Problem. The concept of the mattering map has been widely adopted in contexts as diverse as cultural criticism, psychology, and behavioral economics. Goldstein is a MacArthur Fellow and has received the National Humanities Medal, the National Jewish Book Award, and numerous other honors. Early life and education Goldstein, born Rebecca Newberger, grew up in White Plains, New York. She was born into an Orthodox Jewish family. She has one older brother, who is an Orthodox rabbi, and a younger sister, Sarah Stern. An older sister, Mynda Barenholtz, died in 2001. She did her undergraduate work at City College of New York, UCLA, and Barnard College, where she graduated as valedictorian in 1972. After earning her Ph.D. from Princeton University, where she studied with Thomas Nagel and wrote a dissertation titled \\"Reduction, Realism and the Mind,\\" she returned to Barnard as a professor of philosophy. Career In 1983, Goldstein published her first novel, The Mind-Body Problem, a serio-comic tale of the conflict between emotion and intelligence, combined with reflections on the nature of mathematical genius, the challenges faced by intellectual women, and Jewish tradition and identity. Goldstein said she wrote the book to \\"...insert 'real life' intimately into the intellectual struggle. In short I wanted to write a philosophically motivated novel.\\" Her second novel, The Late-Summer Passion of a Woman of Mind (1989), was also set in academia, though with a far darker tone. Her third novel, The Dark Sister (1993), was something of a departure: a postmodern fictionalization of family and professional issues in the life of William James. She followed it with a short-story collection, Strange Attractors (1993), which was a National Jewish Honor Book and New York Times Notable Book of the Year. A fictional mother, daughter, and granddaughter introduced in two of the stories in that collection became the main characters of Goldstein's next novel, Mazel (1995), which won the National Jewish Book Award and the 1995 Edward Lewis Wallant Award. A MacArthur Fellowship in 1996 led to the writing of Properties of Light (2000), a ghost story about love, betrayal, and quantum physics. Her most recent novel is 36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction (2010), which explores ongoing controversies over religion and reason through the tale of a professor of psychology who has written an atheist bestseller while his life is permeated with secular versions of religious themes such as messianism, divine genius, and the quest for immortality. The book has a long nonfiction appendix (attributed to the novel's protagonist) that details 36 traditional and modern arguments for the existence of God together with their claimed refutations. The book was chosen by National Public Radio as one of the \\"five favorite books of 2010\\" and by The Christian Science Monitor as the best book of fiction of 2010. Goldstein has written two biographical studies: Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt G√∂del (2005) and Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity (2006). Betraying Spinoza combined her continuing interest in Jewish ideas, history, and identity with an increasing focus on secularism, humanism, and atheism. Goldstein has described the book, which combines elements of memoir, biography, history, and philosophical analysis, as \\"the eighth book I'd published, but [the] first in which I took the long-delayed and irrevocable step of integrating my private and public selves.\\". Together with 36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction it established her as a prominent figure in the humanist movement, part of a wave of \\"new new atheists\\" marked by less divisive rhetoric and a greater representation of women. In 2011 she was named \\"Humanist of the Year\\" by the American Humanist Association and \\"Freethought Heroine\\" by the Freedom from Religion Foundation. In 2014, she published Plato at the Googleplex: Why Philosophy Won't Go Away, an exploration of the historical roots and contemporary relevance of philosophy. The book alternates between expository chapters on the life and ideas of Plato in the context of ancient Greece and modern dialogues in which Plato is brought to life in the 21st century, and demonstrates the relevance of philosophy by arguing with contemporary figures such as a software engineer at Google headquarters, a right-wing talk show host, an affective neuroscientist, and others. In addition to Barnard, Goldstein has taught at Columbia, Rutgers, and Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, and since 2014 she has been Sage Center for the Study of the Mind, \\"Distinguished Fellows for 2013-2014\\" a visiting professor at the New College of the Humanities in London. In 2016 she was a Visiting Professor in the Department of English at New York University. She has held visiting fellowships at the Radcliffe Institute, Brandeis University, the Santa Fe Institute, Yale University, and Dartmouth College. In 2011, she delivered the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Yale University, titled \\"The Ancient Quarrel: Philosophy and Literature.\\" She serves on the Council on Values of the World Economic Forum and serves on the Advisory Board of the Secular Coalition for America.Board Goldstein's writing has been published not only in her books but also in chapters in a number of edited books, and in journals including The Atlantic, The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times Book Review, The New York Review of Books, The New Republic, The Wall Street Journal, Huffington Post, Tikkun (magazine), Commentary (magazine), and in blog format in The Washington Post \\"On Faith\\" section. Personal life Goldstein lives in Boston and Truro, Massachusetts.

He was an illegitimate son of James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton, and a younger brother of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran. Royal legitimation In January 1513 James IV declared that because the 1st Earl of Arran then had no heirs, James Hamilton of Finnart the 1st Earl's son, with Patrick Hamilton of Kincavil and John Hamilton of Broomhill, the Earl's two half-brothers, would be considered legitimate and able to inherit Hamilton lands. Patrick bought a house in Linlithgow on the south side of High Street in February 1500, which his son James sold to James Hamilton of Finnart in 1531 when he bought the neighbouring house.HMC, Manuscripts of the Duke of Hamilton, 11th Report Part VI (1887), p.20 no.27, pp.214-5 no.138, p.217-8 nos.152-3 Mining and fighting In March 1516, the infant James V of Scotland and the Governor, Regent Albany leased Patrick to rights to mine for gold, silver, tin and other metals on Crawford Moor and other places.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 1 (1908), p.421, no.2729. In 1520, as a result of rivalry between the Hamiltons and the 'Red' Douglases, he helped instigate the street brawl in Edinburgh known as 'Cleanse the Causeway'. The fight turned out badly for the Hamiltons, and Sir Patrick and about 70 others were killed.

Ankhnesneferibre held the position of Divine Adoratrice until Nitocris' death in pharaoh Apries' regnal Year 4 (586 BC), after which she became the new God's Wife. She governed at Thebes for several decades until 525 BC, when the Persian emperor Cambyses II defeated Psamtik III and conquered Egypt, putting an end to the 26th Dynasty and the positions of Divine Adoratrice of Amun and God's Wife of Amun. After this date, Ankhnesneferibre disappeared from history as the last God's Wife, as did her likely successor, the Divine Adoratrice Nitocris II. As with many of her predecessors, Ankhnesneferibre's tomb is located within the temple of Medinet Habu. For Ankhnesneferibre several attestations are known, above all a statue depicting her now exhibited at the Nubian Museum of Aswan (CG 42205), and her black basalt sarcophagus, which was subsequently reused in Deir el-Medina during the Ptolemaic period by a man named Pymentu, and which is today located in the British Museum.

Pass Plus Scheme commonly referred to as Pass Plus is a scheme run in the United Kingdom aimed at new drivers who have recently passed the standard driving test, which helps to give drivers the confidence to drive on their own and to increase experience on the road.https://www.gov.uk/pass-plus  Introduction and purpose  Pass plus is an optional course introduced by DVSA and is considered the best way to give additional driving experience to a qualified learner by an ADI (Approved Driving Instructor) that has been Pass Plus registered.https://www.gov.uk/pass-plus/booking-pass-plus The main aim of this course is to impart valuable knowledge to drivers who have recently passed the practical driving test, and who want to learn new skills and techniques, improve their anticipation and alertness and learn how to reduce accidents. This course is also sometimes considered as a more advanced course for the new drivers, who have recently completed the studies and haven't faced some situations during their driving lessons. The course is carried out by an approved driving instructor (ADI), who is qualified to teach the course.  Content  Pass Plus comprises six modules,PassPlus modules each covering a different aspect of driving. These modules are: * Town driving * All-weather driving * Driving out of town * Night driving * Driving on dual carriageways * Driving on motorways Some of the aspects may be covered in theory only, such as weather and night driving which require conditions that may be hard to replicate especially in the summer, or motorway driving if there is no motorway nearby. However, this is only done when a practical training session is not possible. The scheme takes a minimum of six hours to complete. The practical assessment is more lenient than that used in the standard driving test, and adherence to many rules that would otherwise constitute a major mistake in the main practical exam (such as parking at an angle) does not apply. It is only required that one is able to drive safely and legally. There is no examination at the end of the Pass Plus course; rather, a certificate is awarded once the instructor is satisfied with the candidate's competence. Each module must be completed to an achieved or exceeded standard, in order to pass: Achieved: successfully reached the driving standard required for each of the competencies. Exceeded: exceeded the driving standard required for each of the competencies. Insurance Many insurance companies offer cheaper car insurance to drivers who have completed the Pass Plus scheme.

The morphology of a river channel is a function of a number of processes and environmental conditions, including the composition and erodibility of the bed and banks (e.g., sand, clay, bedrock); erosion comes from the power and consistency of the current, and can effect the formation of the river's path. Also, vegetation and the rate of plant growth; the availability of sediment; the size and composition of the sediment moving through the channel; the rate of sediment transport through the channel and the rate of deposition on the floodplain, banks, bars, and bed; and regional aggradation or degradation due to subsidence or uplift. River morphology can also be effected by human interaction, which is a way the river responds to a new factor in how the river can change its course. An example of human induced change in river morphology is dam construction, which alters the ebb flow of fluvial water and sediment, therefore creating or shrinking estuarine channels.Bo-yuan Zhu,Yi-tian Li,Yao Yue,Yun-ping Yang. Aggravation of north channels' shrinkage and south channels' development in the Yangtze Estuary under dam-induced runoff discharge flattening. Journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. 5 March 2017 A river regime is a dynamic equilibrium system, which is a way of classifying rivers into different categories. The four categories of river regimes are Sinuous canali- form rivers, Sinuous point bar rivers, Sinuous braided rivers, and Non-sinuous braided rivers. The study of river morphology is accomplished in the field of fluvial geomorphology, the scientific term.

He was a reporter for Newsweek from 1998 to 2011. Bahari was incarcerated by the Iranian government from June 21, 2009 to October 17, 2009, and has written a family memoir, Then They Came for Me, a New York Times best seller . His memoir is the basis for Jon Stewart's 2014 film Rosewater. Bahari later founded the IranWire citizen journalism news site, the freedom of expression campaign Journalism Is Not A Crime and the street art and social justice project Paint the Change. He currently serves on the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Task Force to Protect Minority Communities of the Middle East. Family and education Bahari was born in Tehran, Iran, but moved to Pakistan in 1987 before he immigrated to Canada in 1988 to study communications. His family has been involved in dissident politics in Iran: his father was imprisoned by the Shah's regime in the 1950s, and his sister Maryam under the revolutionary government of Ayatollah Khomeini in the 1980s. She later died of leukemia. He is married to Paola Gourley, an Italian-English lawyer working in London, who gave birth to their first child in October 2009 shortly after his release from prison. Career He graduated with a degree in communications from Concordia University in Montreal in 1993, before continuing some additional studies at the nearby McGill University. Soon after, Bahari made his first film, The Voyage of the Saint Louis, about the attempt by 937 German Jewish refugees to escape Nazi Germany on that ship in 1939, who were turned away by Cuba, the United States, and Canada, and ultimately forced to return to the Third Reich. In producing the film, Bahari became the first Muslim to make a film about the Holocaust. When asked what motivated him to make the film, he cited the courses he took at Concordia, where he: > studied the modern history of the Jews and I was fascinated by the history > of the Jews in North America. I took a course on Freud and religion and the > professor talked a lot about early 20th century anti-Semitism in the U.S. > and Canada. I had no idea that even up until the 1950s Jews were > discriminated against in North America, so I wanted to explore that further. > As an immigrant, I was interested in the history of Jewish immigration from > Europe to America. So I looked for a story to combine all these elements and > came across the story of the St. Louis. Later, while he was imprisoned in Iran the film \\"haunted\\" him, with his interrogators accusing him of being on a mission to work for Zionists. In 1997 Bahari began reporting in Iran and making independent documentaries, and in 1998 he became Newsweek magazine's Iran correspondent. He has produced a number of other documentaries and news reports for Channel 4, BBC and other broadcasters around the world on subjects as varied as private lives of Ayatollahs, African architecture, Iranians' passion for football and contemporary history of Iran. In 2003, Harvard Film Archive praised Bahari's work: > \\"In a country known for neorealist fiction films that focus on small events > in the lives of individuals, the work of Iranian director Maziar Bahari is > somewhat anomalous. Employing a traditional documentary style to explore > more far-reaching cultural events, Bahari‚Äôs films provide a glimpse inside > contemporary Iranian culture as they reveal the human element behind the > headlines and capture cultural truths through the lens of individual > experience. Representing a new generation of young Iranian filmmakers, > Bahari‚Äôs trenchant looks at social issues in his country have brought both > controversy and international acclaim.\\" Bahari's films have won several awards and nominations including an Emmy in 2005. A retrospective of Bahari's films was organized in November 2007 by the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam. In September 2009, Bahari was nominated by Desmond Tutu for the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord, widely known as Spain's Nobel Prize.  Arrest, imprisonment, release  On the morning of June 21, 2009, during the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, Bahari was arrested at his family's home in Tehran and taken to Evin Prison. In July, while incarcerated, he appeared in a televised confession (broadcast internationally by PressTV) telling his interviewer that Western journalists worked as spies; that he had covered \\"illegal demonstrations\\" and \\"illegal gatherings\\", and was helping promote a \\"colour revolution\\". His confession was dismissed by his family, his colleagues, and Reporters Without Borders, saying that it must have come under duress. Outside Iran, an international campaign to free him was headed by his wife and included petitions launched by Committee to Protect Journalists, Index on Censorship, International PEN, and groups of documentary filmmakers. Newsweek ran full- page advertisements in several major newspapers calling for his release. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke publicly of his case. On October 17, after 118 days in jail and charged with 11 counts of espionage, Bahari was released on $300,000 bail. Bahari says he was asked to promise to spy on dozens of \\"anti-revolutionary elements\\" inside and outside Iran for the Revolutionary Guard and report to them weekly (a promise that he had no intention of keeping).Bahari, Maziar Then They Came for Me, A Family's Story of Love, Captivity and Survival, Random House, 2011, p.275-6 He was allowed to leave the country and return to London days before the birth of his daughter. Post-imprisonment Bahari at Oslo Freedom Forum in 2018 After his release, Bahari recounted his time in prison in interviews and writings. He appeared on a segment of the television news program 60 Minutes and was the subject of an article in Newsweek. Bahari stated he confessed on television after physical and psychological torture. He was held in solitary confinement, interrogated daily (either blindfolded or made to face away from his interrogator), threatened with execution, and repeatedly slapped, kicked, punched, and hit with a belt by his interrogator. Bahari's interrogator told him they knew he (Bahari) \\"was working for four different intelligence agencies: the CIA, Mossad, MI6 and Newsweek.\\" Bahari believes it was desperation to find \\"any evidence to prove I was a spy\\" that led his captors to believe his providing an American TV personality with a list of Iranians they could talk to in Iran, was evidence of his being a spy. (Bahari provided such a list shortly before he was interviewed by Jason Jones a \\"correspondent\\" of The Daily Show, who dressed up as a spy as a joke for the story.) He believes he was targeted to intimidate other international Iranian-born journalists, who unlike foreign journalists can operate free of regime minders, blend in with crowds, and understand the cultural and linguistic nuances of the moves the regime makes. In interviews Bahari stated that his interrogator told him not to talk about what happened to him in prison, as the Revolutionary Guards have \\"people all around the world and they can always bring me back to Iran in a bag\\". Bahari has stated that he will not be able to safely return to Iran until the Islamic Republic falls. In Iran he was tried in absentia by a revolutionary court, and sentenced to thirteen and a half years' imprisonment plus 74 lashes.Bahari, Maziar Then They Came for Me, A Family's Story of Love, Captivity and Survival, Random House, 2011, p.310 Campaign for other jailed journalists in Iran Upon his release, Bahari launched a campaign in support of other jailed journalists in Iran. The name of the campaign, Our Future Society Will Be a Free Society, was inspired by a quote from the leader of the Iranian revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. In an International Herald Tribune op-ed to launch the campaign Bahari wrote to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, > \\"You may feel safe in your modest house, protected by thousands of > revolutionary guards. But beyond them the world is changing. Iran is > changing. In 1978, as the shah was doing his best to stifle his people, > Ayatollah Khomeini promised that 'in an Islamic Iran the media will have the > freedom to express all Iran's realities and events.' Hoping they could > realize that promise, Iranians rose up and overthrew the shah. Ayatollah > Khamenei, those who forget the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it.\\"  IranWire  Bahari launched IranWire in 2014, \\"to empower Iranian citizen journalists by creating a forum in which young Iranians can discuss national and local news, providing training modules and putting Iranian citizen journalists inside the country in touch with professional Iranian journalists.\\" Although the website is bilingual, only a fraction of the Persian articles appear in the English. IranWire works with a number of prominent Iranian journalists including Reza Haghighatnejad, Shima Shahrabi, Aida Ghajar, Ehsan Mehrabi and Masih Alinejad. It has a partnership with Daily Beast. IranWire's initial website was designed and developed by Small Media Foundation.https://smallmedia.org.uk/work/iranwire  Press TV vs Maziar Bahari  After his release Bahari launched a complaint against Iranian government's English satellite channel, Press TV, for filming and airing an interview with him under duress. In May 2011, Ofcom upheld Bahari's three complaints against Press TV. In the summary Ofcom said Press TV's presentation of Bahari was unfair because it \\"omitted material facts and was placed in a context in which inferences adverse to Mr Bahari could be drawn\\". The media regulator also said that Press TV failed to get his consent and this \\"contributed to the overall unfairness to Mr Bahari in the item broadcast\\". Ofcom added that filming and broadcasting the interview without consent \\"while he was in a sensitive situation and vulnerable state was an unwarranted infringement of Mr Bahari's privacy\\". Upon the release of Ofcom's findings, Press TV launched a campaign against Bahari and Ofcom. Bahari was accused of being \\"an MI6 contact person\\". Press TV called Ofcom's ruling \\"part of an anti-Iranian campaign,\\" and noted \\"A quick look at senior decision makers at Ofcom demonstrates that the regulator is mostly made up of former Channel 4 and BBC executives, some of whom are well-linked to and influenced by powerful pro-Israeli politicians.\\" Press TV's failure to pay a ¬£100,000 fine for showing Bahari's 'confession' was connected with the revocation of Press TV's licence to broadcast in the UK, via satellite, in January 2012.\\"Iran's Press TV loses UK licence\\", BBC News, 20 January 2012 Awards and honors * Oxfam Novib/PEN Award, nominated for an Emmy for his film  Filmography  * Paint!

Doug Saunders of The Globe and Mail called the book \\"Moving and, at times, very funny\\", and said that it \\"offers a number of lessons about the way Middle Eastern politics work.\\" Leslie Scrivener of The Toronto Star explained \\"Then They Came for Me is a gripping story that weaves his family‚Äôs history of incarceration by Iranian rulers with his own.\\" Mother Jones magazine wrote that \\"Then They Came for Me is not only a fascinating, human exploration into Bahari's personal experience but it also provides insight into the shared experience of those affected by repressive governments everywhere.\\" Kirkus Reviews praised the book for \\"Providing an illuminating glimpse into the security apparatus of one of the world's most repressive countries.

It has been customary to paint the Indalo symbol on the front of houses and businesses to protect them from evil (similar to Kokopelli of the south-western US) and is considered to be a god totem. The indalo has an origin in the Levante, Spain and dates back to 2500 BC.

As their music relies greatly on melody and counterpoint, in contrast to most death metal bands who focus more on moving chords and percussive effects (especially complex palm muting patterns), they are sometimes labeled melodic death metal. However, most fans consider this to be an inaccurate characterization, as the term generally refers to a particular style of death metal, namely, the \\"Gothenburg metal\\" sound pioneered by bands like In Flames and Dark Tranquillity, rather than simply death metal with a strong melodic element. Anata, though hailing from Sweden (considered the birthplace of melodic death metal), bears little resemblance to these bands; they bear a stronger resemblance to technical death metal pioneers such as Cynic and Atheist, who also employed a great deal of counterpoint (for both bands, the two guitars and bass are rarely playing the same part). However, Anata has little of the jazz fusion influences that Cynic or Atheist had, instead fusing the contrapuntal style with the modern technical death metal style of bands such as Psycroptic and Decapitated.

It travels from Niota at the Fort Madison Toll Bridge, that crosses the Mississippi River into Iowa, eastward across central Illinois to State Road 26 (SR 26) at the Indiana state line. Route description IL 9 east just after the Fort Madison Toll Bridge IL 9 is a major arterial route in rural central Illinois. It is a parallel highway to IL 116 to the north and U.S. Route 136 (US 136) to its south. It is a two- lane highway for most of its length. Illinois Route 9 runs eastward from the Mississippi River at the Fort Madison Toll Bridge to the Indiana state line near Cheneyville at SR 26 and SR 352. It crosses the Illinois River on the John T. McNaughton Bridge at Pekin, where it becomes known as Court Street in the city. It has an interchange with I-155 at Tremont; I-55/I-74 at Bloomington; and Interstate 57 (I-57) at Paxton. History IL 9 was established in 1918 as one of the original 46 State Bond Issue Route (SBI) routes. The routing of IL 9 has had two major changes since its establishment. The original western terminus was in Hamilton, at the old Keokuk Rail Bridge completed in 1916 and then proceeded east through Carthage and Macomb (county seats of Hancock and McDonough counties), east of Macomb, southwest of New Philadelphia, the highway turned north to Bushnell and then proceeded east along the current IL 9 alignment to Canton, Peoria County, and Pekin. * US 136, Hamilton to New Philadelphia, * IL 41, New Philadelphia to Bushnell * IL 9, Bushnell to Indiana state line. This current highway moved north to terminate in Niota at the Fort Madison Toll Bridge (longest double-deck swing- span bridge in the world) after its completion in July 1928. The route parallels the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and Mississippi River to Dallas City then turns slightly southeast to LaHarpe. From LaHarpe, the highway parallels the original Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway right-of way to Bushnell. From 1935 to 1937, IL 9 traveled a different route from Pekin to Bloomington, that original route is now posted as: * IL 29, Pekin to North Pekin, * IL 98, North Pekin to Morton, * US 150, Morton to Bloomington.

Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302 (2002), is one of the United States Supreme Court's more recent interpretations of the Takings Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The case dealt with the question of whether a moratorium on construction of individual homes imposed by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency fell under the Takings Clause of the United States Constitution and whether the landowners therefore should receive just compensation as required by that clause. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency was represented by future Chief Justice John Roberts. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the opinion of the Court, finding that the moratorium did not constitute a taking. It reasoned that there was an inherent difference between the acquisition of property for public use and the regulation of property from private use. The majority concluded that the moratorium at issue in this case should be classified as a regulation of property from private use and therefore no compensation was required.. Facts of the case Lake Tahoe Basin falls within both California and Nevada. Those two states created the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) to plan the development of the basin. Between 1981-1984 the TRPA issued two moratoriums on virtually all residential development within the basin. The first moratorium lasted roughly 24 months and the second lasted about 8 months until the TRPA had adopted its comprehensive land-use plan. The plaintiffs in the case were a group of persons who owned individual home sites within the jurisdiction of the TRPA and were therefore subject to the moratoria. The plaintiffs were challenging the law on the grounds that by denying the use of their land, the moratoria issued by the TRPA were in fact takings as described by the Takings Clause of the US Constitution in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and that therefore they should receive just compensation. Procedural history The District Court found that: (1) Even though the land retained some value during the period of the moratoria the landowners were, for a time, completely deprived of any economic use of their land. (2) Therefore the two moratoria did in fact constitute a taking as described by the Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The case was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Circuit Court found that since the moratoria had only temporary impact on the landowners property no taking occurred and no compensation was required. Issue before the Court Whether a moratorium on development imposed during the process of devising a comprehensive land-use plan constitutes a per se taking of property requiring compensation. Decision of the Court Majority opinion The majority opinion written by Justice Stevens dealt with several issues that were raised by the petitioners seeking compensation. First Justice Stevens discarded the petitioners‚Äô assertion that the enactment of the moratorium deprived the plaintiffs of all economic use of the property and therefore required compensation. Justice Stevens held the case law does not support and in fact rejects the idea that a temporary moratorium invokes the Just Compensation clause. The text of the Fifth Amendment itself, he argued, creates a distinction between physical takings and regulatory takings specifying that only physical takings of private property for public purposes require just compensation. Justice Stevens closed this section of his argument predicting that if all takings, physical and regulatory, were to require just compensation then the whole notion of government takings would be, ‚Äúa luxury few governments could afford.‚Äù535 U.S. at 324. Next Justice Stevens dealt with petitioners urging to examine the Court‚Äôs case law dealing with regulatory takings especially Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council(1992). Stevens however dismissed the precedent of Lucas saying that logically the property at issue in the present case cannot be considered to have lost all economic value since as soon as the moratorium is lifted it will recover all economic value. Fluctuations in property value cannot be considered constitutional takings. Lastly Justice Stevens moved on to more functional concerns. If governments are required to compensate landowners every time a moratorium is put into place in order to plan the development of an area, then officials will either rush through the planning process or skip it altogether fostering growth in the community that is either ill-conceived or inefficient.

Relations between the two states have been defined by the violent partition of British India in 1947 which started the Kashmir conflict, and the numerous military conflicts fought between the two nations. Consequently, their relationship has been plagued by hostility and suspicion. Northern India and Pakistan somewhat overlap in certain demographics and shared lingua francas (mainly Punjabi, Sindhi, and Hindustani). After the dissolution of the British Raj in 1947, two new sovereign nations were formed‚Äîthe Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. The subsequent partition of the former British India displaced up to 12.5 million people, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to 1 million. India emerged as a secular nation with a Hindu majority population and a large Muslim minority, while Pakistan, with a Muslim majority population and a large Hindu minority, later became an Islamic Republic,Area, Population, Density and Urban/Rural Proportion by Administrative Units although its constitution guaranteed freedom of religion to people of all faiths. It later lost most of its Hindu minority due to migration and the separation of East Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War. Soon after gaining their independence, India and Pakistan established diplomatic relations, but the violent partition and reciprocal territorial claims quickly overshadowed their relationship. Since their independence, the two countries have fought three major wars, as well as one undeclared war, and have been involved in numerous armed skirmishes and military standoffs. The Kashmir conflict is the main centre-point of all of these conflicts with the exception of the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 and the Bangladesh Liberation War, which resulted in the secession of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). There have been numerous attempts to improve the relationship, notably the Shimla summit, the Agra summit, and the Lahore summit. Since the early 1980s, relations between the two nations have grown increasingly sour, particularly after the Siachen conflict, intensification of the Kashmir insurgency in 1989, Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests in 1998, and the 1999 Kargil War. Certain confidence-building measures, such as the 2003 ceasefire agreement and the Delhi‚ÄìLahore Bus service, have been successful in de-escalating tensions. However, these efforts have been impeded by periodic terrorist attacks. The 2001 Indian Parliament attack brought the two nations to the brink of a nuclear war. The 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings, which killed 68 civilians (most of whom were Pakistani), was also a crucial turning point in relations. Additionally, the 2008 Mumbai attacks carried out by Pakistani militants resulted in a severe blow to the ongoing India‚ÄìPakistan peace talks. After a brief thaw following the election of new governments in both nations, bilateral discussions again stalled after the 2016 Pathankot attack. In September 2016, a terrorist attack on an Indian military base in Indian- administered Kashmir killed 19 Indian Army soldiers, the deadliest such attack in years. India's claim that the attack had been orchestrated by a Pakistan- supported jihadist group was denied by Pakistan, which claimed the attack had been a local reaction to unrest in the region due to excessive force by Indian security personnel. The attack sparked a military confrontation across the Line of Control, with an escalation in ceasefire violations and further militant attacks on Indian security forces. Since 2016, the ongoing confrontation, continued terrorist attacks, and an increase in nationalist rhetoric on both sides has resulted in the collapse of bilateral relations, with little expectation that they will recover. Notably, following the 2019 Pulwama attack, the Indian government revoked Pakistan's most favoured nation trade status, which it had granted to Pakistan in 1996. India also increased the custom duty to 200% which affected the trade of Pakistani apparel and cement. Since the election of new governments in both India and Pakistan in the early 2010s, some attempts have been made to improve relations, in particular the development of a consensus on the agreement of Non- Discriminatory Market Access on Reciprocal Basis (NDMARB) status for each other, which will liberalize trade. Both India and Pakistan are members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and its South Asian Free Trade Area. Pakistan used to host a pavilion at the annual India International Trade Fair which drew huge crowds. Deteriorating relations between the two nations resulted in a boycott of Pakistani traders at the trade fair. In November 2015, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif agreed to the resumption of bilateral talks; the following month, Modi made a brief, unscheduled visit to Pakistan while en route to India, becoming the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Pakistan since 2004. Despite those efforts, relations between the countries have remained frigid, following repeated acts of cross-border terrorism. According to a 2017 BBC World Service poll, only 5% of Indians view Pakistan's influence positively, with 85% expressing a negative view, while 11% of Pakistanis view India's influence positively, with 62% expressing a negative view. In August 2019, following the approval of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, which revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, further tension was brought between the two countries, with Pakistan downgrading their diplomatic ties, closing its airspace, and suspending bilateral trade with India. Seeds of conflict during independence Jinnah and Gandhi engaged in a heated conversation. A well-known photograph recently attributed to Kulwant Roy. About half a million Muslims and Hindus were killed in communal riots following the partition of British India. Millions of Muslims living in India and Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan emigrated in one of the most colossal transfers of population in the modern era. Both countries accused each other of not providing adequate security to the minorities emigrating through their territory. This served to increase tensions between the newly-born countries. According to the British plan for the partition of British India, all the 680 princely states were allowed to decide which of the two countries to join. With the exception of a few, most of the Muslim-majority princely-states acceded to Pakistan while most of the Hindu-majority princely states joined India. However, the decisions of some of the princely-states would shape the Pakistan-India relationship considerably in the years to come. Junagadh issue Saurastra, Gujarat Junagadh was a state on the south-western end of Gujarat, with the principalities of Manavadar, Mangrol and Babriawad. It was not contiguous to Pakistan and other states physically separated it from Pakistan. The state had an overwhelming Hindu population which constituted more than 80% of its citizens, while its ruler, Nawab Mahabat Khan, was a Muslim. Mahabat Khan acceded to Pakistan on 15 August 1947. Pakistan confirmed the acceptance of the accession on 15 September 1947. India did not accept the accession as legitimate. The Indian point of view was that Junagadh was not contiguous to Pakistan, that the Hindu majority of Junagadh wanted it to be a part of India, and that the state was surrounded by Indian territory on three sides. The Pakistani point of view was that since Junagadh had a ruler and governing body who chose to accede to Pakistan, it should be allowed to do so. Also, because Junagadh had a coastline, it could have maintained maritime links with Pakistan even as an enclave within India. Neither of the states was able to resolve this issue amicably and it only added fuel to an already charged environment. Sardar Patel, India's Home Minister, felt that if Junagadh was permitted to go to Pakistan, it would create communal unrest across Gujarat. The government of India gave Pakistan time to void the accession and hold a plebiscite in Junagadh to pre-empt any violence in Gujarat. Samaldas Gandhi formed a government-in-exile, the Arzi Hukumat (in Urdu: Arzi: Transitional, Hukumat: Government) of the people of Junagadh. Patel ordered the annexation of Junagadh's three principalities. India cut off supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and occupied the principalities of Mangrol and Babariawad that had acceded to India. On 26 October, Nawab of Junagadh and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes with Indian troops. On 7 November, Junagadh's court, facing collapse, invited the Government of India to take over the State's administration. The Dewan of Junagadh, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, the father of the more famous Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, decided to invite the Government of India to intervene and wrote a letter to Mr. Buch, the Regional Commissioner of Saurashtra in the Government of India to this effect. The Government of Pakistan protested. The Government of India rejected the protests of Pakistan and accepted the invitation of the Dewan to intervene. Indian troops occupied Junagadh on 9 November 1947. In February 1948, a plebiscite held almost unanimously voted for accession to India. Kashmir conflict Kashmir was a Muslim-majority princely state, ruled by a Hindu king, Maharaja Hari Singh. At the time of the partition of India, Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of the state, preferred to remain independent and did not want to join either the Dominion of India or the Dominion of Pakistan. He wanted both India and Pakistan to recognise his princely state as an independent neutral country. Despite the standstill agreement with Pakistan, teams of Pakistani forces were dispatched into Kashmir. Backed by Pakistani paramilitary forces, Pashtun Mehsud tribals invaded Kashmir in October 1947 under the code name \\"Operation Gulmarg\\" to seize Kashmir. They reached and captured Baramulla on 25 October. Instead of moving on to Srinagar just 50 km away and capturing its undefended airfield, they stayed there for several days. Kashmir's security forces turned out to be too weak and ill-equipped to fight against Pakistan. Fearing that this invasion would bring about an accession to Pakistan, the Maharaja now turned to India and requested India for troops to safeguard Kashmir. Indian Prime Minister Nehru was ready to send the troops, but the acting Governor General of India, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, advised the Maharaja to accede to India before India could send its troops. Hence, considering the emergent situation he signed the instrument of accession to the Union of India on 26 October 1947. Charles Chenevix Trench writes in his 'The Frontier Scouts' (1985): > In October 1947... tribal lashkars hastened in lorries - undoubtedly with > official logistic support - into Kashmir... at least one British Officer, > Harvey-Kelly took part in the campaign. It seemed that nothing could stop > these hordes of tribesmen taking Srinagar with its vital airfield. Indeed > nothing did, but their own greed. The Mahsuds in particular stopped to loot, > rape and murder; Indian troops were flown in and the lashkars pushed out of > the Vale of Kashmir into the mountains. The Mahsuds returned home in a > savage mood, having muffed an easy chance, lost the loot of Srinagar and > made fools of themselves. According to Pakistani General Mohammad Akbar Khan, the raiders \\"delayed in Baramulla for two (whole) days for some unknown reason.\\" While the invading Pakistanis spread across the State and looted Baramulla town just 50 km from the state capital, Srinagar, for several days starting 25 October 1947, the Maharaja signed Instrument of Accession to the Dominion of India on 26 October 1947. Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah had already reached Delhi a day earlier on 25 October to persuade Nehru to send troops. He made no secret of the danger the State faced and asked Nehru to lose no time in accepting the accession and ensuring the speedy dispatch of Indian troops to the State. (Sheikh Abdullah corroborates this account in his Aatish-e-Chinaar (at pages 416 and 417) and records (at page 417) that V.P. Menon returned to Delhi on 26 October with signed Instrument of accession.) The Instrument was accepted by the Governor- General of India the next day, 27 October 1947. With this signing by the Maharaja and acceptance by the Governor-General, the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir became a part of Dominion of India as per the Indian Independence Act 1947 passed by the British parliament. By this time the raiders were close to the capital, Srinagar Indian troops were airlifted from Delhi, landed at Srinagar airport in Kashmir on 27 October 1947 and secured the airport before proceeding to evict the invaders from Kashmir valley. The Indian troops managed to evict the aggressors from parts of Kashmir but the onset of winter made much of the state impassable. After weeks of intense fighting between Pakistan and India, Pakistani leaders and the Indian Prime Minister Nehru declared a ceasefire and sought U.N. arbitration with the promise of a plebiscite. In 1957, north-western Kashmir was fully integrated into Pakistan, becoming Azad Kashmir (Pakistan-administered Kashmir). In 1962, China occupied Aksai Chin, the north-eastern region bordering Ladakh. In 1984, India launched Operation Meghdoot and captured more than 80% of the Siachen Glacier. Pakistan now maintains Kashmiris' right to self-determination through a plebiscite and the promised plebiscite should be allowed to decide the fate of the Kashmiri people. India on the other hand asserts that with the Maharaja's signing the instrument of accession, Kashmir has become an integral part of India. Due to all such political differences, this territorial claim has been the subject of wars between the two countries in 1947 and 1965, and a limited conflict in 1999. The state remains divided between the two countries by the Line of Control (LoC), which demarcates the ceasefire line agreed upon in the 1947 conflict modified in 1972 as per Simla Agreement. Wars, conflicts and disputes India and Pakistan have fought in numerous armed conflicts since their independence. There are three major wars that have taken place between the two states, namely in 1947, 1965 and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. In addition to this was the unofficial Kargil War in 1999 and some border skirmishes. War of 1965 The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 started following the culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 and Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India.Chandigarh, India ‚Äì Main News. Tribuneindia.com. Retrieved on 14 April 2011. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II. Hostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations-mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. The five-week war caused thousands of casualties on both sides. Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units, with substantial backing from air forces, and naval operations. It ended in a United Nations (UN) mandated ceasefire and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. War of 1971 Niazi(sitting second from right) signing the Instrument of Surrender, following the defeat of Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Pakistan, since independence, was geo-politically divided into two major regions, West Pakistan and East Pakistan. East Pakistan was occupied mostly by Bengali people. After a Pakistani military operation and a genocide on Bengalis in December 1971, following a political crisis in East Pakistan, the situation soon spiralled out of control in East Pakistan and India intervened in favour of the rebelling Bengali populace. The conflict, a brief but bloody war, resulted in the independence of East Pakistan. In the war, the Indian Army invaded East Pakistan from three sides, while the Indian Navy used the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant (R11) to impose a naval blockade of East Pakistan. The war saw the first offensive operations undertaken by the Indian Navy against an enemy port, when Karachi harbour was attacked twice during Operation Trident (1971) and Operation Python. These attacks destroyed a significant portion of Pakistan's naval strength, whereas no Indian ship was lost. The Indian Navy did, however, lose a single ship, when INS Khukri (F149) was torpedoed by a Pakistani submarine. 13 days after the invasion of East Pakistan, 90,000 Pakistani military personnel surrendered to the Indian Army and the Mukti Bahini. After the surrender of Pakistani forces, East Pakistan became the independent nation of Bangladesh. Kargil War During the winter months of 1998-99, the Indian army vacated its posts at very high peaks in Kargil sector in Kashmir as it used to do every year. Pakistani Army intruded across the line of control and occupied the posts. Indian army discovered this in May 1999 when the snow thawed. This resulted in intense fighting between Indian and Pakistani forces, known as the Kargil conflict. Backed by the Indian Air Force, the Indian Army regained many of the posts that Pakistan had occupied. Pakistan later withdrew from the remaining portion under international pressure and high casualties. Other territorial claims The relations are locked in other territorial claims such as the Siachen Glacier and Kori Creek. Water disputes The Indus Waters Treaty governs the rivers that flow from India into Pakistan. Water is cited as one possible cause for a conflict between the two nations, but to date issues such as the Nimoo Bazgo Project have been resolved through diplomacy.\\"Unquenchable thirst.\\" The Economist, 19 November 2011. Bengal refugee crisis (1949) In 1949, India recorded close to 1 million Hindu refugees, who flooded into West Bengal and other states from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), owing to communal violence, intimidation and repression from authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, which were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited Liaquat Ali Khan for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this appeasement, Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral conflicts through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir conflict. Afghanistan Afghanistan and Pakistan have had their own historic rivalry over their border, the Durand Line, which numerous Afghan governments have refused to recognize as the border. This has led to strong tensions between the two countries and even military confrontations, resulting in Pakistan as victorious. Pakistan has long accused Afghanistan of harbouring Baloch separatist rebels and attempting to sponsor separatist tendencies amongst its Pashtun and Baloch populations, going as far back as the 1950s. It has been believed that Pakistan during the 1970s, then under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in retaliation began supporting Islamist factions in Afghanistan.Husain Haqqani Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military pg 174 Carnegie Endowment, 2010 , 9780870032851 These factions proved rebellious for the Afghan government that was friendly to the Soviet Union and its South Asian ally, India. The later Soviet intervention in Afghanistan to prevent further escalation and eventual Islamist takeover of the country proved disastrous afterwards. The United States and its allies feared direct Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and began aiding Pakistan's support for the Afghan Mujaheddin, in hopes of crippling the Soviet Union. The Soviet-Afghan war turned out to be a stalemate with heavy casualties on all sides and costly for the Soviets. Under international agreement, the Soviets withdrew. But various Afghan factions fought one another and their external supporters, including the Soviet Union, Iran, Pakistan and others disagreed on which should be in power. Continued rival proxy support led to the civil war, in which Pakistan supported in the Taliban, seeking to secure its interests in Afghanistan and providing strategic support, while India and Afghanistan's other neighbours backed the Northern Alliance. After the Taliban defeated the Northern Alliance in much of Afghanistan in the Afghan Civil War (1996-2001), the Taliban regime continued to be supported by Pakistan ‚Äì one of the three countries to do so ‚Äì before the 11 September attacks. India firmly opposed the Taliban and criticized Pakistan for supporting it. India established its links with the Northern Alliance as India officially recognized their government, with the United Nations. India's relations with Afghanistan, Pakistan's neighbour, and its increasing presence there has irked Pakistan. The 2008 Indian embassy bombing in Kabul was a suicide bomb terror attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan on 7 July 2008 at 8:30 AM local time. US intelligence officials suggested that Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency had planned the attack. Pakistan tried to deny any responsibility, but United States President George W. Bush confronted Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani with evidence and warned him that in the case of another such attack he would have to take \\"serious action\\". Pakistan has been accused by India, Afghanistan, the United States,International Terrorism: Threats and Responses: Hearings Before the Committee on the Judiciary By United States Congress House Committee on the Judiciary, , 1996, pp482 and the United Kingdom, of involvement in terrorism in Kashmir and Afghanistan. In July 2009, former President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari admitted that the Pakistani government had \\"created and nurtured\\" terrorist groups to achieve its short- term foreign policy goals. According to an analysis published by Saban Centre for Middle East Policy at Brookings Institution in 2008 Pakistan was the world's \\"most active\\" state sponsor of terrorism including aiding groups and Pakistan has long aided a range of terrorist groups fighting against India in Kashmir and is a major sponsor of Taliban forces fighting the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan. Insurgency in Kashmir (1989‚Äìpresent) According to some reports published by the Council of Foreign Relations, the Pakistan military and the ISI have provided covert support to terrorist groups active in Kashmir, including the al-Qaeda affiliate Jaish-e-Mohammed.The ISI and Terrorism: Behind the Accusations , Council on Foreign Relations, 28 May 2009 Pakistan has denied any involvement in terrorist activities in Kashmir, arguing that it only provides political and moral support to the secessionist groups who wish to escape Indian rule. Many Kashmiri militant groups also maintain their headquarters in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which is cited as further proof by the Indian government. Journalist Stephen Suleyman Schwartz notes that several militant and criminal groups are \\"backed by senior officers in the Pakistani army, the country's ISI intelligence establishment and other armed bodies of the state.\\" List of some insurgent attacks Insurgents attack on Jammu and Kashmir State Assembly: A car bomb exploded near the Jammu and Kashmir State Assembly on 1 October 2001, killing 27 people on an attack that was blamed on Kashmiri separatists. It was one of the most prominent attacks against India apart from on the Indian Parliament in December 2001. The dead bodies of the terrorists and the data recovered from them revealed that Pakistan was solely responsible for the activity. * Qasim Nagar Attack: On 13 July 2003, armed men believed to be a part of the Lashkar- e-Toiba threw hand grenades at the Qasim Nagar market in Srinagar and then fired on civilians standing nearby killing twenty-seven and injuring many more. * Assassination of Abdul Ghani Lone: Abdul Ghani Lone, a prominent All Party Hurriyat Conference leader, was assassinated by an unidentified gunmen during a memorial rally in Srinagar. The assassination resulted in wide-scale demonstrations against the Indian occupied-forces for failing to provide enough security cover for Mr. Lone. * 20 July 2005 Srinagar Bombing: A car bomb exploded near an armoured Indian Army vehicle in the famous Church Lane area in Srinagar killing four Indian Army personnel, one civilian and the suicide bomber. Terrorist group Hizbul Mujahideen, claimed responsibility for the attack. * Budshah Chowk attack: A terrorist attack on 29 July 2005 at Srinigar's city centre, Budshah Chowk, killed two and left more than 17 people injured. Most of those injured were media journalists. * Murder of Ghulam Nabi Lone: On 18 October 2005, a suspected man killed Jammu and Kashmir's then education minister Ghulam Nabi Lone. No Terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack. * 2016 Uri attack: A terrorist attack by four heavily armed terrorists on 18 September 2016, near the town of Uri in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, killed 18 and left more than 20 people injured. It was reported as \\"the deadliest attack on security forces in Kashmir in two decades\\". * 2019 Pulwama attack: On 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-bound suicide bomber in Lethpora near Awantipora, Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir, India. The attack resulted in the death of 38 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and the attacker. The responsibility of the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. Insurgent activities elsewhere The attack on the Indian Parliament was by far the most dramatic attack carried out allegedly by Pakistani terrorists. India blamed Pakistan for carrying out the attacks, an allegation which Pakistan strongly denied and one that brought both nations to the brink of a nuclear confrontation in 2001‚Äì02. However, international peace efforts ensured the cooling of tensions between the two nuclear-capable nations. Apart from this, the most notable was the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight IC 814 en route New Delhi from Kathmandu, Nepal. The plane was hijacked on 24 December 1999 approximately one hour after takeoff and was taken to Amritsar airport and then to Lahore in Pakistan. After refuelling the plane took off for Dubai and then finally landed in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Under intense media pressure, New Delhi complied with the hijackers' demand and freed Maulana Masood Azhar from its captivity in return for the freedom of the Indian passengers on the flight. The decision, however, cost New Delhi dearly. Maulana, who is believed to be hiding in Karachi, later became the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed, an organization which has carried out several terrorist acts against Indian security forces in Kashmir. On 22 December 2000, a group of terrorists belonging to the Lashkar-e-Toiba stormed the famous Red Fort in New Delhi. The Fort houses an Indian military unit and a high-security interrogation cell used both by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Indian Army. The terrorists successfully breached the security cover around the Red Fort and opened fire at the Indian military personnel on duty killing two of them on spot. The attack was significant because it was carried out just two days after the declaration of the cease- fire between India and Pakistan. In 2002, India claimed again that terrorists from Jammu and Kashmir were infiltrating into India, a claim denied by Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, who claimed that such infiltration had stopped‚ÄîIndia's spokesperson for the External Affairs Ministry did away with Pakistan's claim, calling it \\"terminological inexactitude.\\" Only two months later, two Kashmiri terrorists belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed raided the Swami Narayan temple complex in Ahmedabad, Gujarat killing 30 people, including 18 women and five children. The attack was carried out on 25 September 2002, just few days after state elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir. Two identical letters found on both the terrorists claimed that the attack was done in retaliation for the deaths of thousands of Muslims during the Gujarat riots. Two car bombs exploded in south Mumbai on 25 August 2003; one near the Gateway of India and the other at the famous Zaveri Bazaar, killing at least 48 and injuring 150 people. Though no terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attacks, Mumbai Police and RAW suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba's hand in the twin blasts. In an unsuccessful attempt, six terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e- Toiba, stormed the Ayodhya Ram Janmbhomi complex on 5 July 2005. Before the terrorists could reach the main disputed site, they were shot down by Indian security forces. One Hindu worshipper and two policemen were injured during the incident. 2001 Indian Parliament attack The 2001 Indian Parliament attack was an attack at the Parliament of India in New Delhi on 13 December 2001, during which fourteen people, including the five men who attacked the building, were killed. The perpetrators were Lashkar-e-Taiba (Let) and Jaish- e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists.\\"Govt blames LeT for Parliament attack\\". Rediff.com (14 December 2001). Retrieved 8 September 2011.Embassy of India ‚Äì Washington DC (official website) United States of America . Indianembassy.org. Retrieved 8 September 2011. The attack led to the deaths of five terrorists, six Delhi Police personnel, two Parliament Security Service personnel and a gardener, in total 14 and to increased tensions between India and Pakistan, resulting in the 2001‚Äì02 India‚ÄìPakistan standoff.\\"[Pakistan Primer Pt. 2 From Kashmir to the FATA: The ISI Loses Control] ,\\" Global Bearings, 28 October 2011. 2001‚Äì02 India‚ÄìPakistan standoff The 2001‚Äì2002 India‚ÄìPakistan standoff was a military standoff between India and Pakistan that resulted in the massing of troops on either side of the border and along the Line of Control (LoC) in the region of Kashmir. This was the first major military standoff between India and Pakistan since the Kargil War in 1999. The military buildup was initiated by India responding to a 2001 Indian Parliament attack and the 2001 Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly attack. India claimed that the attacks were carried out by two Pakistan-based terror groups, the Lashkar- e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, both of whom India has said are backed by Pakistan's ISI\\"Who will strike first\\", The Economist, 20 December 2001. a charge that Pakistan denied. Tensions de-escalated following international diplomatic mediation which resulted in the October 2002 withdrawal of Indian\\"India to withdraw troops from Pak border\\" , Times of India, 16 October 2002. and Pakistani troops\\"Pakistan to withdraw front-line troops\\", BBC, 17 October 2002. from the international border. 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings The 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings was a terrorist attack targeted on the Samjhauta Express train on 18 February. The Samjhauta Express is an international train that runs from New Delhi, India to Lahore, Pakistan, and is one of two trains to cross the India-Pakistan border. At least 68 people were killed, mostly Pakistani civilians but also some Indian security personnel and civilians. 2008 Mumbai attacks The 2008 Mumbai attacks by ten Pakistani terrorists killed over 173 and wounded 308. The sole surviving gunman Ajmal Kasab who was arrested during the attacks was found to be a Pakistani national. This fact was acknowledged by Pakistani authorities. In May 2010, an Indian court convicted him on four counts of murder, waging war against India, conspiracy and terrorism offences, and sentenced him to death. India blamed the Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group, for planning and executing the attacks. Indian officials demanded Pakistan extradite suspects for trial. They also said that, given the sophistication of the attacks, the perpetrators \\"must have had the support of some official agencies in Pakistan\\". In July 2009 Pakistani authorities confirmed that LeT plotted and financed the attacks from LeT camps in Karachi and Thatta. In November 2009, Pakistani authorities charged seven men they had arrested earlier, of planning and executing the assault. On 9 April 2015, the foremost ringleader of the attacks, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi was granted bail against surety bonds of in Pakistan. The Indian intelligence agency RAW is claimed to be working in cover to malign Pakistan and train & support insurgents for Balochistan conflict. Weapons of mass destruction India has a long history of development of nuclear weapons. Origins of India's nuclear program dates back to 1944, when started its nuclear program soon after its independence. In the 1940s‚Äì1960s, India's nuclear program slowly matured towards militarization and expanded the nuclear power infrastructure throughout the country. Decisions on the development of nuclear weapons were made by Indian political leaders after the Chinese invasion and territorial annexation of northern India. In 1967, India's nuclear program was aimed at the development of nuclear weapons, with Indira Gandhi carefully overseeing the development of weapons. In 1971, India gained military and political momentum over Pakistan, after a successful military campaign against Pakistan. Starting preparations for a nuclear test in 1972, India finally exploded its first nuclear bomb in Pokhran test range, codename Smiling Buddha, in 1974. During the 1980s‚Äì90s, India began development of space and nuclear rockets, which marked Pakistan's efforts to engage in the space race with India. Pakistan's own program developed space and nuclear missiles and began unmanned flight tests of its space vehicles in the mid-1990s, which continues in the present. After the defeat in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, Pakistan launched its own nuclear bomb program in 1972, and accelerated its efforts in 1974, after India exploded its first nuclear bomb in Pokhran test range, codename Smiling Buddha. This large-scale nuclear bomb program was directly in response to India's nuclear program. In 1983, Pakistan achieved a major milestone in its efforts after it covertly performed a series of non-fission tests, codename Kirana-I. No official announcements of such cold tests were made by Pakistan government. Over the next several years, Pakistan expanded and modernized nuclear power projects around the country to supply its electricity sector and to provide back-up support and benefit to its national economy. In 1988, a mutual understanding was reached between the two countries in which each pledged not to attack nuclear facilities. Agreements on cultural exchanges and civil aviation were also initiated, also in 1988. Finally, in 1998, India exploded its second nuclear test (see: Pokhran-II) which invited Pakistan to follow the latter's step and performed its own atomic tests (see:Chagai-I and Chagai-II). Talks and other confidence building measures After the 1971 war, Pakistan and India made slow progress towards the normalization of relations. In July 1972, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto met in the Indian hill station of Simla. They signed the Simla Agreement, by which India would return all Pakistani personnel (over 90,000) and captured territory in the west, and the two countries would \\"settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations.\\" Diplomatic and trade relations were also re-established in 1976. 1990s In 1997, high-level Indo-Pakistan talks resumed after a three-year pause. The Prime Ministers of Pakistan and India met twice and the foreign secretaries conducted three rounds of talks. In June 1997, the foreign secretaries identified eight \\"outstanding issues\\" around which continuing talks would be focused. The conflict over the status of Kashmir, (referred by India as Jammu and Kashmir), an issue since Independence, remains the major stumbling block in their dialogue. India maintains that the entire former princely state is an integral part of the Indian union, while Pakistan insists that UN resolutions calling for self-determination of the people of the state/province must be taken into account. It however refuses to abide by the previous part of the resolution, which calls for it to vacate all territories occupied. In September 1997, the talks broke down over the structure of how to deal with the issues of Kashmir, and peace and security. Pakistan advocated that the issues be treated by separate working groups. India responded that the two issues be taken up along with six others on a simultaneous basis. Attempts to restart dialogue between the two nations were given a major boost by the February 1999 meeting of both Prime Ministers in Lahore and their signing of three agreements. A subsequent military coup in Pakistan that overturned the democratically elected Nawaz Sharif government in October of the same year also proved a setback to relations. 2000s In 2001, a summit was called in Agra; Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf turned up to meet Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. The talks fell through. On 20 June 2004, with a new government in place in India, both countries agreed to extend a nuclear testing ban and to set up a hotline between their foreign secretaries aimed at preventing misunderstandings that might lead to a nuclear war. Baglihar Dam issue was a new issue raised by Pakistan in 2005. After Dr. Manmohan Singh become prime minister of India in May 2004, the Punjab provincial Government declared it would develop Gah, his place of birth, as a model village in his honour and name a school after him. There is also a village in India named Pakistan, despite occasional pressure over the years to change its name the villagers have resisted. Violent activities in the region declined in 2004. There are two main reasons for this: warming of relations between New Delhi and Islamabad which consequently lead to a ceasefire between the two countries in 2003 and the fencing of the LOC being carried out by the Indian Army. Moreover, coming under intense international pressure, Islamabad was compelled to take actions against the militants' training camps on its territory. In 2004, the two countries also agreed upon decreasing the number of troops present in the region. Under pressure, Kashmiri militant organizations made an offer for talks and negotiations with New Delhi, which India welcomed. India's Border Security Force blamed the Pakistani military for providing cover-fire for the terrorists whenever they infiltrated into Indian territory from Pakistan. Pakistan in turn has also blamed India for providing support to terrorist organizations operating in Pakistan such as the BLA. In 2005, Pakistan's information minister, Sheikh Rashid, was alleged to have run a terrorist training camp in 1990 in N.W. Frontier, Pakistan. The Pakistani government dismissed the charges against its minister as an attempt to hamper the ongoing peace process between the two neighbours. Both India and Pakistan have launched several mutual confidence-building measures (CBMs) to ease tensions between the two. These include more high-level talks, easing visa restrictions, and restarting of cricket matches between the two. The new bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad has also helped bring the two sides closer. Pakistan and India have also decided to co-operate on economic fronts. Some improvements in the relations are seen with the re-opening of a series of transportation networks near the India‚ÄìPakistan border, with the most important being bus routes and railway lines. A major clash between Indian security forces and militants occurred when a group of insurgents tried to infiltrate into Kashmir from Pakistan in July 2005. The same month also saw a Kashmiri militant attack on Ayodhya and Srinagar. However, these developments had little impact on the peace process. An Indian man held in Pakistani prisons since 1975 as an accused spy walked across the border to freedom 3 March 2008, an unconditional release that Pakistan said was done to improve relations between the two countries. In 2006, a \\"Friends Without Borders\\" scheme began with the help of two British tourists. The idea was that Indian and Pakistani children would make pen pals and write friendly letters to each other. The idea was so successful in both countries that the organization found it \\"impossible to keep up\\". The World's Largest Love Letter was recently sent from India to Pakistan. 2010s In December 2010, several Pakistani newspapers published stories about India's leadership and relationship with militants in Pakistan that the papers claimed were found in the United States diplomatic cables leak. A British newspaper, The Guardian, which had the Wikileaks cables in its possession reviewed the cables and concluded that the Pakistani claims were \\"not accurate\\" and that \\"WikiLeaks [was] being exploited for propaganda purposes.\\"Declan Walsh, Pakistani media publish fake WikiLeaks cables attacking India The Guardian 9 December 2010 On 10 February 2011, India agreed to resume talks with Pakistan which were suspended after 26/11 Mumbai Attacks. India had put on hold all the diplomatic relations saying it will only continue if Pakistan will act against the accused of Mumbai attacks. On 13 April 2012 following a thaw in relations whereby India gained MFN status in the country, India announced the removal of restrictions on FDI investment from Pakistan to India. The Foreign Minister of Pakistan on 11 July 2012, stated in Pnom Penh that her country is willing to resolve some of the disputes like, Sir Creek and Siachan on the basis of agreements reached in past. On 7 September 2012, Indian External Affairs Minister would pay 3-day visit to Pakistan to review the progress of bilateral dialogue with his Pakistani counterpart. Response to natural calamities 2001 Gujarat earthquake in India In response to the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, Pakistani President Pervez Mushrraf sent a plane load of relief supplies from Islamabad to Ahmedabad. They carried 200 tents and more than 2,000 blankets. Furthermore, the President called Indian PM to express his 'sympathy' over the loss from the earthquake. 2005 earthquake in Pakistan India offered generous aid to Pakistan in response to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake on 8 October. Indian and Pakistani High Commissioners consulted with one another regarding cooperation in relief work. India sent 25 tonnes of relief material to Pakistan including food, blankets and medicine. Large Indian companies such as Infosys offered aid up to $226,000. On 12 October, an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane ferried across seven truckloads (about 82 tons) of army medicines, 15,000 blankets and 50 tents and returned to New Delhi. A senior airforce official also stated that they had been asked by the Indian government to be ready to fly out another similar consignment. On 14 October, India dispatched the second consignment of relief material to Pakistan, by train through the Wagah Border. The consignment included 5,000 blankets, 370 tents, 5 tons of plastic sheets and 12 tons of medicine. A third consignment of medicine and relief material was also sent shortly afterwards by train. India also pledged $25 million as aid to Pakistan. India opened the first of three points at Chakan Da Bagh, in Poonch, on the Line of Control (LoC) between India and Pakistan for the 2005 Kashmir earthquake relief work. (Rediff) Such generous gestures signalled a new era of confidence, friendliness and cooperation between both India and Pakistan. Fugitives India has accused some of the most wanted Indian fugitives, such as Dawood Ibrahim, of having a presence in Pakistan. On 11 May 2011, India released a list of 50 \\"Most Wanted Fugitives\\" hiding in Pakistan. This was to tactically pressure Pakistan after the killing of Osama bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad. After two errors in the list received publicity, the Central Bureau of Investigation removed it from their website pending a review. After this incident the Pakistani interior ministry rejected the list of 50 Most Wanted men forwarded by India to Islamabad, saying it should first probe if those named in the list were even living in the country. Social relations Cultural links India and Pakistan, particularly Northern India and Eastern Pakistan, to some degree have similar cultures, cuisines and languages due to common Indo-Aryan heritage which span through the two countries and throughout much of the northern subcontinent which also underpin the historical ties between the two. Pakistani singers, musicians, comedians and entertainers have enjoyed widespread popularity in India, with many achieving overnight fame in the Indian film industry Bollywood. Likewise, Indian music and film are very popular in Pakistan. Being located in the northernmost region of the South Asia, Pakistan's culture is somewhat similar to that of North India, especially the northwest. The Punjab region was split into Punjab, Pakistan and Punjab, India following the independence and partition of the two countries in 1947. The Punjabi people are today the largest ethnic group in Pakistan and also an important ethnic group of northern India. The founder of Sikhism was born in the modern-day Pakistani Punjab province, in the city of Nankana Sahib. Each year, millions of Indian Sikh pilgrims cross over to visit holy Sikh sites in Nankana Sahib. The Sindhi people are the native ethnic group of the Pakistani province of Sindh. Many Hindu Sindhis migrated to India in 1947, making the country home to a sizeable Sindhi community. In addition, the millions of Muslims who migrated from India to the newly created Pakistan during independence came to be known as the Muhajir people; they are settled predominantly in Karachi and still maintain family links in India. Relations between Pakistan and India have also resumed through platforms such as media and communications. Aman ki Asha is a joint venture and campaign between The Times of India and the Jang Group calling for mutual peace and development of diplomatic and cultural relations. Geographic links The evening flag lowering ceremony at the India-Pakistan International Border near Wagah. The Indo-Pakistani border is the official international boundary that demarcates the Indian states of Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat from the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Sindh. The Wagah border is the only road crossing between India and Pakistan and lies on the famous Grand Trunk Road, connecting Lahore, Pakistan with Amritsar, India. Each evening, the Wagah border ceremony takes place at the Wagah border in which the flags are lowered and guards on both sides make a pompous military display and exchange handshakes. Linguistic ties Hindustani is the linga franca of North India and Pakistan, as well as the official language of both countries, under the standard registers Hindi and Urdu, respectively. Standard Urdu is mutually intelligible with standard Hindi. Hindustani is also widely understood and used as a lingua franca amongst South Asians including Sri Lankans, Nepalis and Bangladeshis, and is the language of Bollywood, which is enjoyed throughout much of the subcontinent. Apart from Hindustani, India and Pakistan also share a distribution of the Punjabi language (written in the Gurmukhi script in Indian Punjab, and the Shahmukhi script in Pakistani Punjab), Kashmiri language and Sindhi language, mainly due to population exchange. These languages belong to a common Indo-Aryan family that are spoken in countries across the subcontinent. Matrimonial ties Some Indian and Pakistani people marry across the border at instances. Many Indians and Pakistanis in the diaspora, especially in the United States, intermarry, as there are large cultural similarities between the two countries respectively. In April 2010 a high-profile Pakistani cricketer, Shoaib Malik married the Indian tennis star Sania Mirza. The wedding received much media attention and was said to transfix both India and Pakistan. Sporting ties Cricket and hockey matches between the two (as well as other sports to a lesser degree such as those of the SAARC games) have often been political in nature. During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan General Zia-ul Haq travelled to India for a bout of \\"cricket diplomacy\\" to keep India from supporting the Soviets by opening another front. Pervez Musharaff also tried to do the same more than a decade later but to no avail. In tennis, Rohan Bopanna of India and Aisam-ul- Haq Qureshi of Pakistan have formed a successful duo and have been dubbed as the \\"Indo-Pak Express.\\"The Indo-Pak Express rolls on, The Economic Times Diasporic relations The large size of the Indian diaspora and Pakistani diaspora in many different countries throughout the world has created strong diasporic relations. British Indians and British Pakistanis, the largest and second-largest ethnic minorities living in the United Kingdom respectively, are said to have friendly relations with one another. It is quite common for a \\"Little India\\" and a \\"Little Pakistan\\" to co-exist in South Asian ethnic enclaves in overseas countries. There are various cities such as Birmingham, Blackburn and Manchester where British Indians and British Pakistanis live alongside each other in peace and harmony. Both Indians and Pakistanis living in the UK fit under the category of British Asian. The UK is also home to the Pakistan & India friendship forum. In the United States, Indians and Pakistanis are classified under the South Asian American category and share many cultural traits. In the US, intermarriage between Indians and Pakistanis is common. The British MEP Sajjad Karim is of Pakistani origin. He is a member of the European Parliament Friends of India Group, Karim was also responsible for opening up Europe to free trade with India. He narrowly escaped the Mumbai attacks at Hotel Taj in November 2008. Despite the atrocity, Karim does not wish the remaining killer Ajmal Kasab to be sentenced to death. He said: \\"I believe he had a fair and transparent trial and I support the guilty verdict. But I am not a supporter of capital punishment. I believe he should be given a life sentence, but that life should mean life.\\" Trade links Trade across direct routes has been curtailed formally, so the bulk of India-Pakistan trade is routed through Dubai.

Today the water is home to leisure craft, a famous tourist launch and the remains of the fishing fleet that once dominated the area, while on dry land the Scottish Seabird Centre, East Lothian Yacht Club and Auld Kirk Green are the main attractions.  History  The North Berwick Crest The harbour was built around 1150, with the first documented record of its existence coming in 1177. In the early days there were ferry services to Earlsferry near Elie in Fife, with up to 10,000 pilgrims passing through the port every year. When North Berwick received the Royal Charter and became a Royal Burgh in 1373, the design of a ferryboat was incorporated into the town crest, which remains unchanged today. However, pilgrims gradually became few and far between and after over 500 years of operation the ferry services had disappeared by 1692. The focus of the harbour then switched to commerce and fishing. The main exports in 1794 being wheat and barley (corn), and the main imports wood and iron. The harbour was deepened in 1804 and again in 1831 allowing large commercial craft to dock. The arrival of the railway in North Berwick lessened the need for freight to be shipped in but allowed local fishermen to send their catches to all parts of the UK and beyond. As a result, the number of fishing craft swelled from the two recorded at the end of the 17th century to thirty by 1881. At one point there were plans for the railway to extend all the way to the harbour, and for the harbour to be connected to the island of Craigleith by a long pier, but these plans were dropped and the harbour and railway have changed little since. Two shorter piers were built to accommodate larger craft and to allow others to dock when beaten by the tides, the first of which - The North Pier - lasted from 1811 until a huge storm finished it off in 1898. The Galloway Pier, opened in 1877, was initially busy but saw little or no traffic in the inter-war period and was eventually demolished in 1940 having fallen into disrepair. As larger ships no longer visit North Berwick there was no appetite to rebuild a large pier. A smaller, modern concrete pier exists in its place today. The latter half of the 19th century also saw a boom in tourism, as wealthy families discovered North Berwick to be an ideal escape from the overcrowded cities. As well as Edinburgh, train services to North Berwick came direct from as far afield as London as people came to relax, walk, shoot and golf in the area. The outdoor swimming pool at the harbour was a focal point for galas and competitions, while visitors with an interest in nature were able to land on the island bird colonies of Bass Rock and Fidra.  the auld kirk green  The oldest remaining part of the harbour is the \\"Auld Kirk Green\\" or \\"Anchor Green\\", which lies on the opposite site of the original harbour island from the dock. St. Andrews Kirk (church) - which excavations have revealed was built on the foundations of an older church or pagan temple - was built in 1177 and used by pilgrims to pray for safe passage across the water. It later became the North Berwick Parish Church, which precipitated the construction of first a bridge and finally a causeway to the harbour island. Legend has it that on Halloween 1590, Satan himself attended a coven on the Auld Kirk Green, although a more earthly version of the tale records that Satan was \\"played\\" by Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell. Stuart was a pretender to the throne and was apparently attempting to incite a storm which would sink the boat carrying James VI back from Norway with his new bride. In any case, this event so angered James VI that it triggered the North Berwick Witch Trials and the witch hunts that would eventually sweep the length and breadth of Britain. Those known to have participated in rituals at North Berwick are said to have died during the subsequent investigations, most likely at the hands of their \\"investigators\\".Scotsman article on the Auld Kirk and visit of Satan, accessed 27 March 2006. The church ceased to host services and funerals in 1673, although part of one original wall remained standing until 1845. The area has been excavated several times, most recently when the adjacent ground was being prepared for the building of the Scottish Seabird Centre, and finds have included Roman coins and Viking artefacts. Digs have also unearthed well preserved skeletal remains, including those of children and murder victims, and metal pilgrims badges in the form of St. Andrew during crucifixion. St. Andrews Kirk was restored in 2005 as a tourist attraction after receiving a ¬£50,000 grant from the National Lottery Fund. Visitors can learn more about the history of the Auld Kirk Green, from its beginnings in the 7th century, through pilgrim times and the mysteries of the witches, right up to the present day.  Modern day  Although the red sandstone harbour and buildings have changed little in their external appearance, the old granary is now home to modern flats and the interior of many others have been remodelled for housing, boat storage or office space. The Scottish Seabird Centre has become a major tourist attraction since opening in 2000 and tourists can still take Sula II to see the gannets, puffins and other birdlife in the area. The outdoor swimming pool finally closed in 1996. It has since been filled in and is now a dinghy park, although some of the original buildings and viewing galleries still remain intact. The East Lothian Yacht Club is an accredited centre of sailing and sail training excellence and hosts national and international yachting and boating events from the harbour. The racing and cruising yachts of ELYC members now make up the bulk of vessels in the harbour, with a fishing fleet of just 3 for company. Just up the road along the old causeway from the harbour is the RNLI Lifeboat station, with one of the famous Blue Peter lifeboats always on call.
