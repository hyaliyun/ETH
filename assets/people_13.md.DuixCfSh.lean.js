A will left by a local heiress, Petronila Rodríguez de Rojas, stipulated that her roughly lot in uptown Buenos Aires be used for an educational and charitable compound to include a church, an old-age asylum and a girls' school for no less than 700 pupils. Her 1882 death accordingly left the property to the city, which commissioned German Argentine architects Carlos Adolfo Altgelt and his cousin Hans Altgelt to design the requisite school. Work began in 1886Mysteries of Buenos Aires, the creation of the Pizzurno Palace|http://misteriosabsas.blogspot.com/2012/03/palacio-pizzurno.html on the building which, per Mrs. Rojas' wishes, would include extensive museum and library facilities, as well. The building's design was eclectic, inspired by Second Empire architecture influenced by both French and German Renaissance Revival architecture. It was completed in 1888, and the Petronila Rodríguez de Rojas School was inaugurated in 1893. The majestic landmark was soon earmarked for use as government offices, however, and the National Education Council was installed there in 1903; the National Education Council (since dissolved) administered Argentina's system of national secondary schools. The building was rebaptized as the Sarmiento Palace in honor of former Education Minister and President Domingo Sarmiento, who made \\"the education of a sovereign people\\" a policy centerpiece during his prosperous 1868-74 tenure. The building's location facing leafy Rodríguez Peña Plaza created an urban oasis in the otherwise bustling Barrio Norte section of the upscale Recoleta ward. A lot immediately to the south of the building was converted into Petronila Rodríguez de Rojas Plaza (a playground) as a belated homage to the civic- minded lady during the 1950s (as was a primary school in the Parque Chas neighborhood, in 1934). The last dictatorship, which dissolved the Education Council in 1978, transferred the Ministry of Education to the building in 1980. Still officially known as the Sarmiento Palace, the building is popularly known as the Pizzurno Palace for the side street built facing it, which was renamed in honor of pedagogian and local primary school system pioneer Pablo Pizzurno, following his death in 1940.

Fir Manach originally referred to a distinct kin group of alleged Laigin origins. The kingdom of Fermanagh was formed in the 10th century, out of the larger kingdom of Uí Chremthainn, which was part of the overkingdom of Airgíalla.MacCotter, Paul. Medieval Ireland: territorial, political and economic divisions. Four Courts Press, 2008, p.243 By the late 11th century it had grown to cover all of what is now County Fermanagh. The kingdom came to be ruled by the Mag Uidhir (Maguire) clan from the late 13th century onward. They were based at Lisnaskea, and their royal inauguration site was nearby Sgiath Gabhra (Skeagoura), now called Cornashee.FitzPatrick, Elizabeth. Royal Inauguration in Gaelic Ireland. Boydell Press, 2004. p.84 Under Hugh Maguire, Fermanagh was involved in the Nine Years' War against English rule. His successor, Cú Chonnacht Óg Mag Uidhir, was one of the Gaelic Irish leaders who fled Ireland during the Flight of the Earls. Fermanagh was subsequently merged into the Kingdom of Ireland as County Fermanagh. History Laighin ancient origins The original Fir Manach or Fear Manach, that is to say the Manach or Monaigh people in the north of Ireland, claimed descent from the Laighin of Leinster. They reached upper Lough Erne in ancient times. According to the Book of Glendalaugh (also known as the Rawlinson B 502) a genealogy is provided for the early Manach people and they claim descent from Dáire Barrach, the son of Cathair Mór, High King of Ireland. Dáire Barrach's descendants elsewhere in Ireland are today known as the MacGorman (Mac Gormáin) and ruled Uí Bairrche during the Middle Ages. Cathair Mór himself had ruled Ireland as King of Tara in the 2nd century. Connachta and Three Collas The geopolitical situation in Ireland changed during the 4th and 5th centuries, owing to the rise of the descendants of Conn of the Hundred Battles. Most significantly for the Fir Manach, the kingdoms of Airgíalla (under the descendants of the Three Collas), the kingdom of Ailech (under the Uí Néill) and the kingdom of Connacht (under the Uí Briúin) arose. According to Peadar Livingstone, the territory of Fermanagh became disputed between these groups and the previously ruling Fir Manach people.. 11th century onwards By the end of the 11th century, Fermanagh had decisively re-emerged as a sovereign kingdom in the region. The rulers of this kingdom were drawn from the Airgíalla. Early on the territory drew kings from three branches of Clann Lugainn; the Ó hEignigh (O'Heany), Maolruanaidh (Mulrooney) and Ó Dubhdara (Darragh). These families claimed descent from the Three Collas, in the person of Colla Fochríth and were thus kinsmen of the MacMahon kings of Airgíalla. Towards the end of the 13th century, the Mag Uidhir (Maguire) arose to the kingship of Fermanagh and with the exception of some challenges from the Ó Domhnaill of Tyrconnell, this would remain the situation until the end of the kingdom in 1607 with the Flight of the Earls.

The Centre – previously known as the Division of History and Philosophy of Science, which was founded in 1956 – is one of the oldest units of its kind in the world. Throughout its history, the Centre has been home to many of the leading historians and philosophers of science who have deepened our understanding of scientific activity and how it shapes and is shaped by wider society. Early history and expansion The key figure in establishing history and philosophy of science (HPS) as a discipline at Leeds was the philosopher of science Stephen Toulmin, who was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Leeds in 1954 and head of department in 1956. Whilst Thomas Kuhn is often seen as the founder of the modern field of history and philosophy of science, Toulmin had argued for an integration of philosophy of science and history of science some nine years before Kuhn published his famous work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.Toulmin, Philosophy of Science: An Introduction (1953) In the 1970s, historian of genetics Robert Olby became a leading figure in the Division through his book Path to the Double Helix,Robert Olby, Path to the Double Helix (1974). which showed how the 1953 discoveries of Crick and Watson were rooted in the work of two University of Leeds scientists: the creator of molecular biology, William Astbury, and the Nobel prizewinning inventor of X-ray crystallography, William Henry Bragg. Diversification and expansion in the 1990s From 1993 onwards, Leeds HPS took a new direction as several new specialist appointments were made in the philosophy of science, the history of medicine and the history of technology. Professor Steven FrenchSteven French, University of Leeds, UK. came to Leeds in 1993, having previously worked in Brazil and the USA. Adrian Wilson,Adrian Wilson, University of Leeds, UK. Lecturer in History of Medicine, came to the Division under a Wellcome University Award. Dr Wilson's main research focus is seventeenth- and eighteenth-century midwifery/childbirth, particularly with reference to male and female roles in delivery – a subject he explored in his book The Making of Man-Midwifery (1995). In 1994, Graeme GoodayGraeme Gooday, University of Leeds, UK. was appointed to teach courses on the history and philosophy (especially the ethics) of technology. Jonathan TophamJonathan Topham, University of Leeds, UK. arrived in Leeds in 1999 as an AHRB Institutional Fellow for the Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical (SciPer) Project,Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical (SciPer) Project, University of Leeds, UK. having previously worked on the Darwin Correspondence Project and at the University of Cambridge. The work of the SciPer Project reflects Dr Topham's wide interest in the production and reading of scientific publications in nineteenth-century Britain, a subject on which he has published a number of widely cited articles. Topham's other main research focus is on science and religion, and he has published valuable articles on natural theology and theologies of nature in nineteenth-century Britain. As a lecturer in history and philosophy of science since January 2005, Topham has helped develop a new Masters programme in science communication in collaboration with the University of Leeds's Institute of Communication Studies.Communication Studies , University of Leeds, UK. After completing his postgraduate studies at Cambridge, Dr Gregory RadickGregory Radick, University of Leeds, UK. was appointed as lecturer in the HPS Division in 2000 during Professor Cantor's sabbatical, becoming a permanent member of staff in 2003.

Family  Remus von Woyrsch was born at the estate Pilsnitz (Pilczyce, now part of Fabryczna) near Breslau (Wrocław) in Prussian Silesia. He came from old Bohemian nobility, first from South Bohemia and then from ca. 1500 in Troppau (Opava) in Moravian Silesia. He married Thekla von Massow (1854–1943) from East Prussia, on 26 September 1873 in Potsdam, Brandenburg. She was the daughter of the royal Prussian forester Hermann von Massow. His nephew Udo von Woyrsch (1895–1983) was an SS Obergruppenführer and SS and Police Leader.  Career  After Woyrsch finished high school in Breslau, he joined the 1st Potsdamer Garde-Grenadier Regiment on 5 April 1866. He served at the battle of Königgrätz in 1866. He later fought in the 1870–71 Franco- Prussian war where he was wounded but earned the Iron Cross. In 1901 Woyrsch was promoted to divisional commander. He retired in 1911 but was re-activated in August 1914 to command the Landwehr Corps and was quickly sent to help the Austro-Hungarian Army fighting in partitioned Poland. He came up to the Vistula, and then reinforced the left wing of the Austro-Hungarian army under General Viktor Dankl von Krasnik. In the three days of battle against the Imperial Russian army Woyrsch covered the retreat of the Austrians with his corps Landwehrkanal. A St. Petersburg newspaper wrote that: \\"Only the activity of the small Prussian Landwehr troops in this battle prevented the complete destruction of the Austrian army.\\" Later he was included in Paul von Hindenburg's 9th Army. In July 1915 Woyrsch was involved in the breakthrough battle of Sienno near Wongrowitz (Wągrowiec). In 1916 he helped fight off the Russian Brusilov Offensive and in 1917 was promoted Generalfeldmarschall. In 1920 Woyrsch retired, again, to his family estate at the castle Pilsnitz near Breslau. After his death the famous Silesian sculptor Paul Ondrusch created a wooden sculpture of Woyrsch to decorate the main hall inside the town hall of Leobschütz (Głubczyce). Woyrsch was portrayed as a knight wearing a coat and a chain mail, with his hands placed on a handle of a large sword resting against the ground.Maler, Katarzyna (1996), \\"Dzieła Paula Ondruscha zachowane na Ziemi Głubczyckiej\\", Kalendarz Głubczycki (Głubczyce) (1997): p. 75, ISSN 1231-4803 (Polish)  Honours  * Ehrenbürger (Honorary citizen) of Breslau * Ehrenbürger (Honorary citizen) of Neisse * Honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Philosophy  Orders and decorations  * Iron Cross (1871) * Order of the Black Eagle * Order of Saint John (Johanniterorden) * Pour le Mérite on 25 October 1914  References  Further reading * Bruno Clemenz: Generalfeldmarschall von Woyrsch und seine Schlesier – Eigenhändige Auszüge aus seinem Kriegstagebuch.

She previously represented the Basque coalition Geroa Bai (Basque for Yes to the Future), and before that, Nafarroa Bai (Basque For Yes to Navarre), in the Spanish Congress of Deputies.  Career in journalism  Barkos graduated in Information Sciences at the University of Navarra. She worked as a newsreader on Spanish National Radio (Radio Nacional de España) and for Televisión Española, the state run television stations. She also worked for the newspaper Navarra Hoy and from 1990 onwards she worked for the main Basque broadcaster Euskal Telebista as newsreader and Madrid correspondent.  Congress of Deputies  In 2004, in order to maximise the Basque vote, the individual parties Aralar, Eusko Alkartasuna (Basque Solidarity), Batzarre and the Basque Nationalist Party agreed to form the coalition Yes to Navarre (Nafarroa Bai) to contest the Navarre constituency, an area where Basque nationalism had historically been weakest. Barkos, who was not a member of any of the parties, was selected to head the list at the 2004 Spanish General Election. The list polled 17.98%, which represented the highest vote share for any Basque list in the constituency since democracy was restored in 1977. In Congress she worked to promote Basque language and culture in Navarre, although she was criticised by Batasuna, which was not part of the NB coalition. In Congress she was also a member of the Commission which investigated the 2004 Madrid train bombings. At the 2008 Spanish General Election, Barkos retained her seat with a slightly better result (18.53%). In 2011, Barkos and independents affiliated with the Yes to Navarre coalition founded new political group Zabaltzen under her leadership, in order to strengthen the coalition after Batzarre and Eusko Alkartasuna left, and Aralar decided to join Amaiur. Aralar prevented the rest of members from continuing to use Nafarroa Bai as a name; Zabaltzen, the Basque Nationalist Party and the newly incorporated Atarrabia Taldea contested the 2011 Spanish General Election as Geroa Bai (Yes to the Future). Barkos retained her seat polling 12,84%.  Pamplona City Council  Barkos was Nafarroa Bai's candidate for Mayor of Pamplona at the 2007 local elections, obtaining 28.851 votes (26.26%) and 8 city councillors out of 27. Yolanda Barcina from Navarrese People's Union was invested mayor by the City Council. Barkos acted as Nafarroa Bai's spokesperson in the City Council; in 2008, it was her turn to set the chupinazo off to mark the beginning of the popular San Fermín festival. In the 2011 local elections, Barkos retained her seat as councillor and her position as Nafarroa Bai's spokesperson; Enrique Maya from Navarrese People's Union was invested mayor by the City Council.  President of Navarre  In September 2015, she was announced as Geroa Bai's candidate for President of Navarre. After the 2015 regional election, she was invested President of Navarre on 20 June 2015 thanks to the support of the regional parliament members of Geroa Bai (9), EH Bildu (8), Podemos (7) and Izquierda- Ezkerra (2), gaining the necessary majority (26 out of 50).

It is affiliated to the Mahatma Gandhi University and is reaccredited A grade by NAAC. Campus St. Dominic's College (also known as SD College) is located in Kanjirappally, Kottayam. The campus is 4 km from Kanjirappally town along the NH 220 highway. The campus is connected by buses to Kottayam, Pala and Changanacherry. The facilities are integrated into a single block. The administrative section is located at the ground floor. The departments are distributed across the two wings of the entrance. The college has an auditorium with integrated indoor sports facilities. The auditorium was constructed to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of the college. The college sports stadium is located to the right of the main building. History St Dominic's College was started in 1965 under the Catholic management of St Dominic's Forane Church, Kanjirappally, to cater to the higher educational needs of the parish in particular, and of the eastern parts of the Archdiocese of Changanacherry in general. This was the fulfillment of a long-felt need of this region which was one of the educationally backward areas in Kerala. When the new Diocese of Kanjirappally was formed in 1977, St Dominic's College assumed the unique distinction of being the only institution offering higher education in the whole diocese. The college also includes in its purview the academic aspirations of the non-Catholic communities of the area and is committed to imparting education to all who seek higher learning at these doors, irrespective of caste, creed and community. This centre of learning keeps in its interests the intellectual, cultural and moral advancement of the whole area. True to the adage \\"Fear of God is the beginning of wisdom\\", the college tries to instill in the hearts of its students trust in God and faith in ethical and spiritual values. It aims at upholding the highest Christian ideals along with academic excellence. The College aims at making its students live its motto-‘Absorb and Radiate’-absorb the light of knowledge and values and transmit what they imbibe, thereby expanding the frontiers of truth and wisdom.

The Consortium provides a forum for sharing expertise and good practice; it is committed to collaboration as a way of building relationships around libraries, users and collections to bring added value to services.Lanigan, 2005 Whilst its direct customers are member libraries, indirect customers include students, academics, and researchers of member institutions (and beyond).Lanigan, 2005 Acting as a single voice for its diverse membership, the Consortium has aimed to represent the interests of academic and research libraries at both regional and national level. It has built working relationships with several information service organisations, including: *Research Libraries UK, formerly CURL *Jisc *SCONUL The Consortium's technical and administrative support team is based at the British Library of Political and Economic Science, London School of Economics, 10 Portugal Street, London. WC2A 2HD. Projects and services The Consortium's work has facilitated a range of services and resources for the benefit of learners and researchers. *The M25 Web Guide to M25 libraries was launched in 1996, winning a UCISA award in 1997. M25 LINK, launched in 1998, aimed to provide single search access to the OPACs of a subset of six members of the M25 Consortium of Higher Education Libraries.Sykes, 1998 *M25 Web Guide and M25 Link were replaced in 2001 by the Inform25 suite of services, still in operation: Find a Library enables users to find information about member libraries; the Search Catalogue service allows users to simultaneously search across forty catalogues, with online help and a clear user interface;Enright, 2002 the Union List of Serials holds data on periodicals in the libraries of the University of London and University of Westminster. *M25 Access Scheme. Launched in its original form in 1997, this project was influential in the creation of Sconul's 'Research Extra' scheme – a co-operative venture enabling researchers from participating institutions to visit any other participating library and register as an external borrower;Hall, 2003 Research Extra (and UK Libraries Plus) were then superseded by 'Sconul Access' in 2006.Hall, 2007 Today the M25 Access Scheme enables library users from those libraries that are not eligible to participate in Sconul Access (i.e. non-HE) to use the services of HE libraries within the Consortium. *In 2003 cpd25 was launched. Five cpd25 Task Groups, each focusing on different areas of library and information service provision – from legal compliance to building management – devise a yearly programme of Continuing Professional Development events. Training is tailored for library staff, at all stages in their careers,Cox-De Souza, 2008 and is open to staff in both member institutions and external libraries. In 2007, cpd25 was awarded CILIP's training and development Seal of Recognition. *The Consortium has undertaken valuable work in the area of Disaster Planning, the most widely known product of which being the freely available Disaster Control Plan Template, first created in 1997.Wise, 2006 In addition, since 1999,Wise, 2006 all Consortium members are signatories to a reciprocal Mutual Support Agreement, under which members will, in the event of a disaster at another institution, endeavour to provide physical access, study spaces, and services to the affected library's users. *The Consortium has produced a Service Level Definition Template which can be used either as an internal document for library use only or as an external document to express service levels to stakeholders. Current and future M25 continues to grow and forge additional partnerships with library sector organisations. On an ongoing basis the Consortium reviews and looks to improve services offered to users; currently it is looking into ways to encourage member libraries to allow walk-in visitor access to electronic resources.

The name of this genus derives from the Malay word meaning squirrel or small animal resembling a squirrel.Wilkinson, R. J. (1901). A Malay-English dictionary Kelly & Walsh Limited, Hongkong, Shanghai and Yokohama.  Characteristics  Raffles described the genus as having an elongated snout, eight to 10 incisors, well-developed limbs, five- toed naked feet, and the sole furnished with projecting pads and sharp claws, with a habit and tail of a squirrel. Marcus Ward Lyon published a revision of the genus in 1913, and also noted the squirrel-like appearance of Tupaia species, which only lack the long black whiskers and have smaller ears. They do not have any markings on the face, the naked area of the nose is finely reticulated, an oblique stripe on the shoulder is more or less distinct, and the tail is haired but not tufted. The braincase is about as wide as the maxillary tooth row is long. The temporal fossa is smaller than the orbit. The dental formula is . The first pair of upper incisors is longer than the second, while the second pair of lower incisors is slightly larger than the first and third pairs. The lower canines are better developed than the upper ones and stand high above the adjacent premolars. The size of head, body, and tail varies between species. One outstanding characteristic of Tupaia species is their color vision. They have rod and cone visual receptors similar to humans and other primates.Shriver, J .G., Noback, C. R. (1967). Color Vision in the Tree Shrew (Tupaia glis). Folia Primatologia 6: 161−169.  Classification and taxonomic history  When Diard and Duvaucel described the first specimen of the common treeshrew Tupaia glis in 1820, they considered it a species of Sorex.Diard, P.M., Duvaucel, A. (1820). \\"Sur une nouvelle espèce de Sorex — Sorex Glis\\". Asiatick researches, or, Transactions of the society instituted in Bengal, for inquiring into the history and antiquities, the arts, sciences, and literature of Asia, Volume 14: 470–475. T. everetti was moved back into the genus from Urogale, disbanding the latter, based on a 2011 molecular phylogeny. Subsequent to Raffles' description of the genus, these additional Tupaia species were described: * Northern treeshrew T. belangeri — by Wagner in 1841Wagner, J. A. (1841).

In the past, various authors proposed to place treeshrews in the ordinal rank Insectivora, or considered them close relatives of primates. Since 1972, the treeshrew families Tupaiidae and Ptilocercidae are grouped in the order Scandentia.Butler, P. M. (1972). The problem of insectivore classification. In: K. A. Joysey and T. S. Kemp (eds.) Studies in vertebrate evolution. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh. Pp. 253−265.Martin, R. D. (1968).

C., Bell, S. K. (1997). Classification of mammals above the species level. Columbia University Press, New York. Distribution and habitat Tupaia species range from northeastern India, Burma, and Nicobar Islands eastward to members of the Philippine Islands, and from central China south to Java, Borneo, and Sumatra, including islands on the southwest coast. They do not occur on Celebes, nor on islands to the east of Java, with the possible exception of Bali. They inhabit the dense undergrowth of tropical forests. With the exception of T. minor, they are primarily terrestrial and forage on the forest floor, usually below . Since they are rarely seen crossing wide roads, populations likely are negatively affected by fragmentation of forests caused by logging operations.Emmons, L. (2000). Tupai: A field study of Bornean treeshrews. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press. Ecology and behaviour Early naturalists described wild-caught captive Tupaia specimens as restless, nervous, and rapidly reacting to sounds and movements. Their auditory sensitivity is highly developed as the broad frequency range of their hearing reaches far into the ultrasonic.Peterson, E. A., Wruble, S. D., Ponzoli, V. I. (1968). Auditory responses in tree shrews and primates. Journal of Auditory Research 8(3): 345–355. The shape of the cheek-teeth of Tupaia species indicate they are foremost insectivores. Captive specimens were reported to hunt ants, flies, crickets, grasshoppers, cockroaches, and small beetles. They hold their food between their forelegs while sitting on their haunches. After feeding, they smooth their heads and faces with both forepaws, and lick their lips and palms. They are also fond of water, both to drink and to bathe. They fortify their diet with soft fruits that are mostly dispersed by birds. They swallow the pulp, but reject fibrous components, which they cannot digest due to their long and small intestines and rudimentary ceca.Emmons, L. H. (1991). Frugivory in Treeshrews (Tupaia). The American Naturalist. 138(3): 642–649. The well-developed olfactory perception of treeshrews enables them to easily detect food among the leaf litter on the forest floor. Their sensitivity for odours coupled with scent-marking of their territories is important in their interaction with conspecifics.Gould, E. (1978). The behavior of the moonrat, Echinosorex gymnurus (Erinaceidae) and the pentail shrew, Ptilocercus lowi (Tupaiidae) with comments on the behavior of other insectivora. Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie 48(1): 1–27.Kawamichi, T. and Kawamichi, M. (1979). Spatial Organization and Territory of Tree Shrews (Tupaia glis). Animal Behavior 27(2): 381–393. Observations of Tupaia species in their natural habitats suggest they usually form monogamous pairs. Social behaviour differs between species and the available food resources in their territories. Where food is adequate and sufficient, they tolerate conspecifics without engaging in territorial disputes. Common treeshrews observed in the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve defended diminishing food resources by chasing away residents of adjacent areas. Birds of prey, snakes, and small carnivores are known to hunt treeshrews. Humans have no interest in killing them for food because of their unpleasant taste, and they are rarely seen as pests.Cisneros, L. (2005). \\"Tupaia glis\\" (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. Reproduction and development Treeshrews share more similarity with rodents and squirrels than with primates in regards to their reproduction and development. In contrast to primates, which produce one baby with longer gestation periods, treeshrews generally have litters of two or three young and are only in utero about 45 days. Female treeshrews give birth in nests made of many dry leaves, and are known to leave the young unattended while returning occasionally to give them milk. Parental care of Tupaia is relatively limited.Collins, P. M. and Tsang, W. N. (1987). Growth and reproductive development in the male treeshrew (Tupaia belangeri) from birth to sexual maturity. Biology of reproduction 37(2): 261–267. The young remain in the nest for 33 days on average, developing gradually before they exit the nest. Ten identified embryonic developmental stages are seen in Tupaia species.Kuhn, H, and Schwaier, A. (1973). Implantation, early placentation, and the chronology of embryogenesis in Tupaia belangeri. Zeitschrift für Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte 142(3): 315–340. Baby treeshrews are sexually immature until about 90 days after birth. Medical research Their close relationship to primates makes treeshrews important model organisms in human medical research. A study investigating the effects of the Borna disease virus on treeshrews has given new insight into neurological disease.Sprankel, H., Richarz, K., Ludwig, H. and Rott, R. (1978). Behavior Alterations in Tree Shrews Induced by Borna Disease Virus. Medical Microbiology and Immunology 165(1): 1–18. Since Tupaia species share so many similarities with primates, yet are more abundant and have more plentiful progeny than them, interest is increasing in using them as an alternative model for use in human medical research. Successful psychosocial studies were carried out, and dramatic behavioral, neuroendocrinal, and physiological changes occurred in subordinate males of Tupaia, similar to depressed human patients. Their susceptibility to viruses has also piqued interest in using them to study immune responses to infections such as hepatitis B.Cao, J., Yang, E. B., Su, J. J., Li, Y., Chow, P. (2003). The Tree Shrew: Adjuncts and Alternatives to Primates as Models for Biomedical Research. Journal of Medical Primatology. 32(3): 123–130. Tupaia species have been used to overcome the limitations of using rodent models in the study of human biology and disease mechanisms, as well as the development of new drugs and diagnostic tools. Recent studies have used treeshrews to study infectious, metabolic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases, as well as cancers.Xu, L., Zhang, Y., Liang, B., Lü, L. B., Chen, C. S., Chen, Y. B., Yao, Y. G. (2013). Tree shrews under the spot light: emerging model of human diseases. Dongwuxue Yanjiu 34(2): 59–69. (in Chinese) In 2013, the Virology Journal published an article that documents the use of the northern treeshrew (T. belangeri) as medical models for the H1N1 influenza virus. This was advantageous because other possible candidates such as guinea pigs, rats, mice, and other rodents leave gaps in the information, especially regarding clinical symptoms and transmission. Tupaia, though, displays moderate systemic and respiratory symptoms, as well as pathological changes in the respiratory tract, supporting its use as a beneficial model in H1N1 research.Yang, Z. F., Zhao, J., Zhu, Y. T., Wang, Y. T., Liu, R., Zhao, S. S., Li, R. F., Yang, C., Li, J., Zhong, N. S. (2013). The tree shrew provides a useful alternative model for the study of influenza H1N1 virus. Virology Journal 10 (1): 111.

He played college football at University of Tennessee at Martin, and was selected in the fifth round of the 2013 NFL Draft by the Indianapolis Colts. He has also been a member of the New York Giants, Kansas City Chiefs, Washington Redskins, Memphis Express, and Los Angeles Wildcats. Early years Hughes was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He attended Siegel High School in Murfreesboro, where he was a three-year starter and led the Siegel Stars high school football team in tackles with 106, tackles-for-loss with 25 and sacks with 13 as a senior in 2007. He was named the Region 4-5A Defensive MVP, all-region, all-area and all-county and participated in the Toyota East-West All-Star Classic in 2007. Also starring in basketball, Hughes averaged double figures in scoring and rebounding for Siegel High School. Rated only a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Hughes was not ranked among the best defensive tackle prospects in the nation. Scout.com, which listed Hughes as a three-star recruit, ranked him as No. 49 overall defensive tackle in the 2008 class. Jamie Newberg of Scout.com later admitted that recruiting services overlooked Hughes: \\"Right now, to me, he may be the best prospect in the state when it's all said and done. And we just flat missed him.\\" Hughes had scholarship offers from Jacksonville State and Tennessee State, but committed to Tennessee after head coach Phillip Fulmer offered him a scholarship. Fulmer compared Hughes to former Vols defensive tackle Justin Harrell, who transformed from a little-known recruit to a first- round pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. College career Hughes originally signed with the University of Tennessee in January 2008, but failed to qualify academically. He spent several months at Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia, before enrolling at Tennessee in January 2009. Hughes had bulked up from 275 to 310 pounds in little over a year, and emerged as one of the Tennessee Volunteers football team's most talented defensive freshman. He was expected to play in Tennessee's 2011 season opener; however, Hughes was dismissed from the team on June 9, 2011, by head coach Derek Dooley. Hughes subsequently transferred to the University of Tennessee at Martin, and played for the UT Martin Skyhawks football team in 2011 and 2012. Professional career Indianapolis Colts Hughes was selected by the Indianapolis Colts in the fifth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. On September 5, 2015, Hughes was waived by the Colts. New York Giants On September 7, 2015, Hughes was signed to the New York Giants' practice squad. On November 10, 2015, he was elevated to the active roster. On September 4, 2016, Hughes was released by the Giants. On September 13, 2016, Hughes was re-signed by the Giants. He was released on October 11, 2016. Kansas City Chiefs On January 31, 2017, Hughes signed a reserve/future contract with the Chiefs. He was released on August 4, 2017. Washington Redskins On January 3, 2018, Hughes signed a reserve/future contract with the Washington Redskins. He was released on April 30, 2018. Memphis Express In 2019, Hughes joined the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football. The league ceased operations in April 2019.

McCall was one of four children of Alexander McCall. He was married to Elise Donaldson (1899–1976) and had one son, Ted Jr.Biographical info by his great nephewSearch results on Ancestry.ca Career in comics Comic strips On February 13, 1933, The Toronto Evening Telegram began publishing McCall's comic strip Men of the Mounted, drawn by Harry Hall.Punch in Canada on McCall The strip starred Corporal Keene. It was the first strip based on the RCMP as well as being Canada's first regular adventure strip. Syndicated across Canada, it ran for two years until King of the Royal Mounted, an American strip, began to be published.Biography of Harry Hall, illustrator of Men of the Mounted, at Lambiek McCall had approached King Features about syndicating his strip in the United States but was rejected. When King of the Royal Mounted was started, McCall felt they had plagiarized his idea. The last strip was published on February 16, 1935, the day before King of the Royal Mounted started. The strips were also adapted into a Big Little Book published by Whitman PublishingReferences to the Whitman books and were featured in trading cards from Willard's Chocolates. A little over 7 months later, on September 23, 1935, McCall began another strip, this time based on the Robin Hood legends. Robin Hood and Company was illustrated by Charles Snelgrove and was also originally only published in the Telegram. Overall it was more successful and eventually was published internationally in more than 80 papers, including some in the US and Europe. Snelgrove died in late 1939 and, after a brief hiatus, the strip was continued by Syd Stein.Biography of Charles Snelgrove at Lambiek The last strip was published on February 16, 1939 after Stein joined the army.Canadian Archives The strip was popular and lasted a while because of \\"McCall's deft writing, inventive plots and earthy humor\\". It did not follow the traditional plots of the Robin Hood mythos but did include secondary characters such as Little John, Friar Tuck and Will Scarlett. Anglo- American Publishing On December 6, 1940, the War Exchange Conservation Act was passed by the Canadian government. Amongst the things it did was banning the importation of American comic books. McCall saw this as an opportunity and approached Harold Sinnott of Sinnott News. McCall owned both the copyright and the plates for publishing Robin Hood and Company and Sinnot had a press capable of printing comics. In March 1941, the first issue of Robin Hood and Company was published by Anglo-American Publishing, consisting of strip reprints in a tabloid sized format. The comic existed with just reprints for about a year when it became necessary to start producing new material. McCall became the main writer at Anglo-American and brought with him Ed Furness as the main artist. While at Anglo-American Publishing, McCall created the war hero Freelance, \\"a daring guerrilla battling the Axis powers\\". McCall's \\"well rounded scripts...were relatively sophisticated for the time and generally took a realistic approach to war\\". McCall was also involved in creating the adventures of Red Rover and Commander Steel.Punch in Canada on Robin Hood Freelance ran from 1941 to January 1947.Freelance at the GCD Robin Hood ran, under various titles, for the same time period.Robin Hood at the GCD After Anglo-American closed its doors in 1947, McCall never produced anything for comics again.

The northern boundary of the locality is the Condamine River, while the south-western boundary is Wambo Creek (a tributary of the Condamine River).  History  Hopeland State School opened on 8 February 1937. The school was mothballed in December 2006 and finally closed in December 2007. Economy The heavy black soil on which the district sits is considered in the top 3% of Australia for broad acre agriculture mainly due to its high field capacity and yield potential. The area uses both dryland farming and irrigation to produce sorghum, cotton, corn, wheat, millet, chick pea, mung bean, barley, triticale and oats. Given the high nutrient value of the soil, the district continually wins both state and national cropping competitions, most recently with a dryland sorghum crop yielding over 10 tonnes per hectare or over 4 tonnes per acre.

It is usually denoted q. In the triangle zenith—object—celestial pole, the parallactic angle will be the position angle of the zenith at the celestial object. Despite its name, this angle is unrelated with parallax. The parallactic angle is zero or 180° when the object crosses the meridian.  Uses  For ground-based observatories, the Earth atmosphere acts like a prism which disperses light of different wavelengths such that a star generates a rainbow along the direction that points to the zenith. So given an astronomical picture with a coordinate system with a known direction to the North Celestial Pole, the parallactic angle represents the direction of that prismatic effect relative to that reference direction. Depending on the type of mount of the telescope, this angle may also affect the orientation of the celestial object's disk as seen in a telescope. With an equatorial mount, the cardinal points of the celestial object's disk are aligned with the vertical and horizontal direction of the view in the telescope. With an altazimuth mount, those directions are rotated by the amount of the parallactic angle. The cardinal points referred to here are the points on the limb located such that a line from the center of the disk through them will point to one of the celestial poles or 90° away from them; these are not the cardinal points defined by the object's axis of rotation. The orientation of the disk of the Moon, as related to the horizon, changes throughout its diurnal motion and the parallactic angle changes equivalently. This is also the case with other celestial objects. In an ephemeris, the position angle of the midpoint of the bright limb of the Moon or planets, and the position angles of their North poles may be tabulated. If this angle is measured from the North point on the limb, it can be converted to an angle measured from the zenith point (the vertex) as seen by an observer by subtracting the parallactic angle. The position angle of the bright limb is directly related to that of the subsolar point. Derivation The vector algebra to derive the standard formula is equivalent to the calculation of the long derivation for the compass course. The sign of the angle is basically kept, north over east in both cases, but as astronomers look at stars from the inside of the celestial sphere, the definition uses the convention that the is the angle in an image that turns the direction to the NCP counterclockwise into the direction of the zenith. In the equatorial system of right ascension and declination the star is at ::\\\\mathbf{s} = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\cos\\\\delta \\\\cos \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos \\\\delta\\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\delta\\\\end{array} \\\\right). In the same coordinate system the zenith is found by inserting , into the transformation formulas ::\\\\mathbf{z} = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\cos l\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\sin l\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\varphi\\\\end{array} \\\\right), where is the observer's geographic latitude, the star's altitude, the zenith distance, and the local sidereal time. The North Celestial Pole is at ::\\\\mathbf{N} = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c}0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right). The normalized cross product is the rotation axis that turns the star into the direction of the zenith: ::\\\\mathbf{\\\\omega}_z = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin z}\\\\mathbf{s}\\\\times \\\\mathbf{z} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin z}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\cos\\\\delta\\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\sin\\\\varphi -\\\\sin\\\\delta\\\\cos\\\\varphi\\\\sin l\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\cos\\\\delta\\\\cos\\\\alpha\\\\sin\\\\varphi +\\\\sin\\\\delta \\\\cos\\\\varphi\\\\cos l\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\delta \\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\sin(\\\\alpha-l) \\\\end{array} \\\\right). Finally is the third axis of the tilted coordinate system and the direction into which the star is moved on the great circle towards the zenith. The plane tangential to the celestial sphere at the star is spanned by the unit vectors to the north, ::\\\\mathbf{u}_\\\\delta = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} -\\\\sin\\\\delta\\\\cos\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin\\\\delta\\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\delta \\\\end{array}\\\\right), and to the east ::\\\\mathbf{u}_\\\\alpha = \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} -\\\\sin\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right). These are orthogonal: ::\\\\mathbf{u}_\\\\delta \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u}_\\\\alpha=0;\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{u}^2_\\\\delta = \\\\mathbf{u}^2_\\\\alpha=1. The parallactic angle is the angle of the initial section of the great circle at s, east of north, ::\\\\omega_z\\\\times \\\\mathbf{s} = \\\\cos q\\\\, \\\\mathbf{u}_\\\\delta + \\\\sin q \\\\, \\\\mathbf{u}_\\\\alpha. ::\\\\cos q = (\\\\omega_z\\\\times \\\\mathbf{s})\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u}_\\\\delta = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin z}(\\\\cos\\\\delta\\\\sin\\\\varphi -\\\\sin\\\\delta \\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\cos h), ::\\\\sin q = (\\\\omega_z\\\\times \\\\mathbf{s})\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u}_\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin z}\\\\sin h \\\\cos\\\\varphi. (The previous formula is the sine formula of spherical trigonometry.) The values of and of are positive, so using atan2 functions one may divide both expressions through these without losing signs; eventually ::\\\\tan q = \\\\frac{\\\\sin h\\\\cos\\\\varphi}{\\\\cos\\\\delta \\\\sin\\\\varphi -\\\\sin\\\\delta \\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\cos h}= \\\\frac{\\\\sin h}{\\\\cos\\\\delta \\\\tan\\\\varphi-\\\\sin\\\\delta \\\\cos h} yields the angle in the full range . The advantage of this expression is that it does not depend on the various offset conventions of ; the uncontroversial offset of the hour angle takes care of this. For a sidereal target, by definition a target where and are not time-dependent, the angle changes with a period of a sidereal day . Let dots denote time derivatives; then the hour angle changes as ::\\\\dot h =\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{T_s} and the time derivative of the expression is ::\\\\dot q \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos^2 q}= \\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\varphi[\\\\cos h \\\\cos\\\\delta \\\\sin\\\\varphi-\\\\sin\\\\delta\\\\cos\\\\varphi]}{(\\\\cos\\\\delta \\\\sin\\\\varphi-\\\\sin\\\\delta \\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\cos h)^2} \\\\dot h; ::\\\\dot q = \\\\frac{\\\\cos \\\\varphi[\\\\cos h \\\\cos\\\\delta \\\\sin \\\\varphi -\\\\sin \\\\delta \\\\cos\\\\varphi]}{\\\\sin ^2z}\\\\dot h = \\\\frac{\\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\cos a \\\\cos A}{\\\\sin^2 z}\\\\dot h =\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\varphi \\\\cos A}{\\\\sin z}\\\\dot h.

He previously served as Nuncio to Colombia and in Rome at the Secretariat of State as Undersecretary for Relations with States. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1996 and was made an archbishop in 2013. Biography Balestrero was born in Genoa on 21 December 1966; his mother was an American. After attending law school, he entered the Almo Collegio Capranica and was ordained a priest on 18 September 1993 for the Diocese of Rome by Cardinal Camillo Ruini. He earned a degree in theology and a doctorate in Canon Law. After serving in the Parish of Santa Maria Mater Ecclesiae al Torrino, he became a student at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. He entered the Holy See's diplomatic service in 1996 and held positions in Korea, Mongolia and the Netherlands. Beginning in 2001 he served in the Secretariat of State. On 17 August 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Undersecretary for Relations with States, replacing Pietro Parolin who was named Apostolic Nuncio to Venezuela the same day. Balestrero speaks fluent English as well as French, Spanish, German and Dutch. As Undersecretary, Balestrero was the Vatican’s representative to Moneyval, the arm of the Council of Europe charged with the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Moneyval’s July 2016 assessment showed the Vatican had substantially improved its compliance, though it identified ongoing problems as well. Balestrero accepted its judgements and said the report was \\"not an end, but a milestone in our continuing efforts ... an important passage in our continuing efforts to marry moral commitments to technical excellence. On 22 February 2013, in the last week of the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI, Balestrero was appointed apostolic nuncio to Colombia and Titular Archbishop of Vittoriana. He received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone on 27 April. In Colombia he supported the government's entente with the FARC guérilla movement and the peace agreement reached in November 2016, leading to a papal visit to Colombia in 2017. Early in 2018, the Apostolic Nuncio to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Archbishop Luis Mariano Montemayor, returned to Rome after being declared persona non grata for his criticisms of DRC President Joseph Kabila. On 6 July, the Holy See sent Balestrero to the nunciature in the DRC to resolve its affairs (per il disbrigo degli affari), though he was not given a title in the nunciature. On 27 April 2019, after elections and a change of government in the DRC, Pope Francis named Balestrero apostolic nuncio to the DRC.

As such, it is a higher concept than the meridian as defined in astronomy, which takes account of the terrain and depth to the centre of Earth at a ground observer's location. The hour circles, specifically, are perfect circles perpendicular (at right angles) to the celestial equator. By contrast, the declination of an object viewed on the celestial sphere is the angle of that object to/from the celestial equator (thus ranging from +90° to −90°). The location of stars, planets, and other similarly distant objects is usually expressed in the following parameters, one for each of the three spatial dimensions: their declination, right ascension (epoch-fixed hour angle), and distance. These are as located at the vernal equinox for the epoch (e.g. J2000) stated. A meridian on the celestial sphere matches an hour circle at any time. The hour circle is a subtype whereby it is expressed in hours as opposed to degrees, radians, or other units of angle. The hour circles make for easy prediction of the angle (and time due to Earth's fairly regular rotation, approximately equal to the time) between the observation of two objects at the same, or similar declination. The hour circles (meridians) are measured in hours (or hours, minutes, and seconds); one rotation (360°) is equivalent to 24 hours; 1 hour is equivalent to 15°. An astronomical meridian follows the same concept and, almost precisely, the orientation of a meridian (also known as longitude) on a globe.

The film is inspired by the novel \\"Les dernieres jours du monde\\" by Dominique Noguez, which is officially credited in the production brochure,http://medias.unifrance.org/medias/96/164/42080/presse/happy- end-2009-press-kit-2.pdf however, in the film credits, \\"Amour noir\\" is also noted as an inspiration. Plot The film flips back and forth between events that take place one year apart from each other. In the present, Robinson Laborde (Mathieu Amalric) lives in Biarritz in his parents' apartment. He has one hand and a prosthetic. One year before, while visiting his parents with his wife, Chloé (Karin Viard), and daughter Mélanie (Manon Beaudoin), he sees a very attractive woman, Laetitia (Omahyra Mota), on the beach and falls hopelessly in love with her. He starts an affair and, as the film develops, it is evident that he has left his family to be with her. In the present, Robinson is looking for a notebook; the sales lady, Ombeline (Catherine Frot), tells him that paper has become scarce and all she can offer is a cooking book with blank spaces for notes. Later on, Ombeline happens to meet Robinson at a bar and starts small talk with him: she seems to know him but he does not remember. In the past, Laetitia has suddenly left Robinson; she is into pornography and prostitution although she denies having any sexual involvement with her \\"clients\\". There is news about a virus that is wiping everyone in the world but life goes on as usual. Robinson stops in a bar and finds his friend Théo (Sergi Lopez), a tenor. Theo tells him a story about the time he was a music teacher to the Marquise d'Arcangues (Sabine Azéma), who had a baby by him, that included Iris (Clotilde Hesme), who is tending the bar. The Marquise told Theo that she had a dream that if he and Iris made love, they would save the world. In the present, Biarritz is suddenly evacuated; Robinson decides to go to Zaragoza, in Spain, to track Laetitia down. He stops in an abandoned boarding school and there is an earthquake. Robinson continues his trip and arrives in Pamplona, where everyone is celebrating the Sanfermines. He finds Ombeline and the two walk their way through town trying to find a place to stay, to no avail. Ombeline tells Robertson that her husband has left her to search for another woman in Spain. He starts telling her his story, which he has been writing in the cooking book she sold him. Suddenly, there are terrorist attacks in Pamplona and the two leave for a hotel in the mountains; Ombeline manages to secure a suite that is usually reserved for the Royal Family. While Robinson and Ombeline make love, helicopters are seen through the windows. Later that night, while having dinner, Ombeline sees her husband with the other woman, Iris. Since Robertson will do nothing, she calls him a coward and he leaves. While leaving the hotel, he receives a video from his daughter who is doing well off in a ship. As he records an answer, Ombeline has stolen her husband's car and they finally reach Zaragoza. Ombeline reveals that she was his father's lover, but they suddenly stopped their relationship. In the past, Robinson and Laetitia are living together and travel to Taiwan. He is trying to have a nice traditional vacation but she manages to ruin everything. She disappears once again and he is forced to go back to France because his parents have gone missing. Laetitia suddenly reappears in Canada, he meets her there, and, as they are enjoying the snow, a couple of gangsters appear and take Laetitia back; they leave Robinson to find his way back to civilization. Due to frostbite, he loses his right hand. In the present, Robinson tracks Laetitia's mother (Baya Belal) down but she has no idea where her daughter is. The alarms go off and all are evacuated. Robinson and Ombeline arrive by train in Toulouse, the new capital city of France. There, he meets with his wife again who asks him to join her at her hotel, which is the new government headquarters. Robinson and his ex-wife make love but are interrupted by a call and new alarms. In the TV monitors, news is seen that the world is sinking into chaos. Robinson abandons Ombeline and decides to go to the theatre where Theo shall be singing; as the opera goes, Ombeline finds Robinson, she is furious because he had left her, but is forced to sit and watch the opera. She wonders about men and is tired of their infidelity. She reaches into her purse and takes out Robinson's father's lamp-knife and cuts her throat. The opera is interrupted but, also, the sound of a bomb going off evacuates the theatre. Robinson wanders the streets and finds his wife who offers to take him in a military airplane to a safe place, because nuclear missiles shall be launched upon France, but he decides to stay to find Laetitia. She then decides to stay and, as she goes off to tell her party to leave, a terrorist attacks the van killing all; Robinson is injured by the debris. The next morning, all streets are deserted. Robinson stumbles back to the hotel and finds Theo there. They talk and Theo confesses that Robinson has been the love of his life. They kiss but Robinson suddenly stops. He opens the windows as Theo showers, but as he comes out of the bathroom, he jumps off the balcony and dies. Robinson leaves the hotel with Iris, who had spent the night with Théo – her father. She tells him of a castle where there is a fall-out shelter and she knows the code to enter, they stop to eat in a country hotel where all the guests are dead. Iris dies too, it is unclear if because of the virus or due to overdose. Robinson reaches the castle and enters with the code, he finds a decadent party going on where all the guests are enjoying their last moments on earth before going into the shelter. They are watching porn and having sex, while drinking blue martinis. Robinson breaks the news of Iris' death to the Marquise, who lays down in bed with a crucifix on her chest. Robinson spots a screen where he sees Laetitia and realises that she is still alive. As he tries to track her down on the internet, he is knocked off by an old man. The next day, all is quiet. As he wanders through the castle, he finds all the guests dead in the main salon; the servants poisoned the martinis to take over the shelter. Robinson leaves.

It was specifically developed for the use in the primary care setting.Brodaty, H., et al., The GPCOG: a new screening test for dementia designed for general practice. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 2002. 50(3): p. 530-4.  The test  The GPCOG consists of both a cognitive test of the patient and an informant interview to increase the predictive power. Both parts can be scored separately, together, or sequentially. The cognitive test includes nine items: (1) time orientation, clock drawing: (2) numbering and spacing as well as (3) placing hands correctly, (4) awareness of a current news event and recall of a name and an address ( (5) first name, (6) last name, (7) number, (8) street, and (9) suburb). Each correct answer is valid one point leading to a maximum score of 9 (fewer points indicate more impairment). For further information on the scoring of the GPCOG please refer to the section “Scoring the GPCOG”. The informant interview asks six historical questions from an informant/next of kin who knows the patient well. He or she is asked to compare the patient's current function with his/her performance a few years ago. Areas that are covered in the informant interview include memory, word finding difficulties, trouble managing finances, difficulties managing medication independently and needing assistance with transportation. Administration of the GPCOG takes less than four minutes for the cognitive test and less than two minutes for the informant interview making it a very brief and easy to use screening tool.  Scoring the GPCOG   Patient interview Each of the nine items is worth one point. Correct answers are added up, leading to a maximum score of 9. A person who scores 9 on the GPCOG can be considered cognitively intact. Further steps are not required, though re-testing after 12 months is recommended. A score of 5 to 8 indicates some impairment but further information is required. The user/general practitioner is asked to conduct the informant interview. Someone scoring 4 points or less is very likely to have cognitive impairment. There is no need to complete the informant interview. However, the conduction of standard investigations such as lab tests is required to rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment. Informant interview The informant interview is to be conducted if further information about the patient's function is required (i.e. cognitive test score 5 to 8). It consists of six questions which can be answered with “yes” (=impairment), “no” (=no impairment), “don’t know” or “N/A”. Each question is worth one point. As a “yes” answer indicates impairment it is scored 0, while all other answers score 1 point each; (hence higher scores indicate less impairment). A score of 0 to 3 in the informant interview in conjunction with a score of 5 to 8 in the patient interview indicates cognitive impairment and requires further investigations such as lab tests to rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment (see above). If the patient has difficulties in less than 3 areas (i.e. score of 4 to 6) he/she can be considered cognitively intact for the time being. Re-testing in 12 months is recommended though.  Psychometric properties  The psychometric properties of the GPCOG are good. The reliability of the patient section is high. For the informant interview, reliability is satisfactory. In the original validation sample of 380 participants, the sensitivity of the GPCOG was 0.85, the specificity was 0.86. The positive predictive value was highest in people aged under 75 (0.90) and 0.72 for the total sample. The negative predictive value for the total sample was 0.93 making it a good tool to rule out cognitive impairment. On all measures the GPCOG performed at least as well as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).Brodaty, H., N.M. Kemp, and L.-F. Low, Characteristics of the GPCOG, a screening tool for cognitive impairment. International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 2004. 19(9): p. 870-4. Of note, positive and negative predictive values depend on the prevalence of the disorder in the studied population.  GPCOG vs other screening tools  Three recently conducted literature reviews recommend the GPCOG as brief screening tool for GPs.Brodaty, H., et al., \\"What is the best dementia screening instrument for general practitioners to use?\\" American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 2006. 14(5): p. 391-400.Lorentz, W.J., J.M.

Neurology 1999; 52: 231-238 A recently conducted study in AustraliaBasic D, Khoo A, Conforti D et al: Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale, Mini- Mental State Examination and General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition in a multicultural cohort of community-dwelling older persons with early dementia. Australian Psychologist 2009; 44(1):40-53 found that the GPCOG in comparison to the MMSE and Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) Storey J, Rowland J, Basic D et al: The Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS): A multicultural cognitive assessment scale. International Psychogeriatrics 2004; 16: 13-31 was best to rule out dementia in a multicultural cohort of 151 community-dwelling persons. Its sensitivity was higher (98.1) as compared to MMSE and RUDAS (84.3 and 87.7, respectively). The specificity was somewhat smaller than that of the other tools. While the MMSE score in this sample was influenced by the cultural and linguistic background of the participants the GPCOG and RUDAS scores were not. This indicates that the latter are more cultural unspecific screening tools than the MMSE making them especially invaluable in multicultural patient settings.  Languages  The GPCOG was first published in English in 2002. French and Italian versions have been validated since then,.Thomas P, Hazif-Thomas C, Vieban F et al: Intérêt du GPcog pour le reperage d’une population agée a risque élève de demence.

Int Psychogeriatr (under revision). Their performance is similar to that of the English version. A Greek version is currently under evaluation. Translations in other languages such as Spanish, German, Mandarin or Cantonese are available upon request from the author or accessible from the GPCOG website (see section below). As mentioned above the performance on the GPCOG seems to be independent from one's cultural and linguistic background.  Web- based version  In May 2009, the GPCOG website was launched and is accessible on www.gpcog.com.au. It contains a web-based version of the GPCOG as well as links and tools for GPs dealing with elderly and cognitively impaired patients. The underlying algorithm of the website scores the test and prompts the user to conduct further investigations if required in accordance with the individual test result. Links to national and international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of dementia in the primary care setting as well as links to Alzheimer Associations in various countries are available. Paper and pencil tests in various languages can be downloaded from that website as well. As the GPCOG itself, also the website is available in various languages. Its use is free of charge and no registration is required.

The explosives went off simultaneously across the capital at approximately 10:45 in the morning, killing at least 101 and wounding at least 565, making it the deadliest attack since the 14 August 2007 Yazidi communities bombings in northern Iraq which killed almost 800 people. The bombings were targeted at both government and privately owned buildings. Bombings The bombings occurred on the six-year anniversary of the bombing of the United Nations compound in Baghdad, which killed the UN's then-coordinator of the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq, Sérgio Vieira de Mello. The capture of two Al- Qaeda members in a car intended to be used as another bomb led officials to believe they were part of a coordinated attack. The attack began in early mid- morning, when a truck bomb exploded outside the Iraqi Finance Ministry. A larger explosion followed outside the Foreign Ministry, accompanied by mortar attacks on the secure Green Zone. The bombing shattered windows, killing those near them, and also brought down the compound wall across the street from the truck bomb. The foreign ministry explosion alone killed 58 people, and left a crater deep and wide. The next car bomb killed at least eight people and wounded at least 22 as it devastated a combined Iraqi army-police patrol near the Finance Ministry. Two bombings in distant areas of the city, one in the commercial Baiyaa district killing two and wounding 16, the other in the Bab al-Muadham district killing six and wounding 24. One targeted the Rasheed Hotel, blowing out windows and door frames. Several mortars fell inside the Green Zone's perimeter, one near the UN compound, where aid workers were meeting to discuss the \\"growing danger\\" facing aid groups. the mortars were not confirmed by C-RAM IZ or any other US military. In total, the attacks killed upwards of 90 people and injured upwards of 500. Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki had been scheduled to deliver a speech at a nearby hotel, but this was canceled due to attacks. Suspects and claim Immediate suspicions went towards 'the Baathist alliance', 'Al-Qaeda', and 'Sunni extremists'. But the attacks were claimed, end of October 2009, by Islamic State of Iraq, calling the targets “dens of infidelity”.

Education He studied at Krishnath College, Baharampur, and Presidency College, Kolkata, and taught economics at Krishnath College. He earned a master's degree from the London School of Economics and secured a PhD in economics from London University after carrying out research under Harold Laski.Samsad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical Dictionary) by Anjali Bose, Vol II, 3rd edition 2004, page 150, , (in Bengali) Sishu Sahitya Samsad Pvt. Ltd., 32A Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Kolkata-700009 Political career While in London, Sanyal served on several committees for the London branch of the Indian National Congress, a banned organization. He was arrested twice for his participation. Sanyal returned to India to become a professor at Calcutta University, but the government disallowed his appointment because of his activism. Sanyal took a position with insurance companies New India Assurance Co., the Metropolitan Assurance Co., and the Hindustan Co-operative Society Ltd. Sanyal continued to actively protest against British colonial rule and was imprisoned seven times. He was elected to the Bengal Assembly and served as Chief Whip of the Indian National Congress of undivided Bengal, prior to the partition of the province. He was a vocal critic of the colonial government's policies during the Bengal Famine in 1943. In 1946, Sanyal was at the forefront of efforts to avoid the Partition of India. His suggestion of a loose federation was widely circulated and debated but was ultimately not adopted. When India was partitioned in 1947, he and Atulya Ghosh were able to convince the British to leave Maldah district in India (the area had a population that was evenly divided between Hindus and Muslims). After the independence, Sanyal remained an active force in building the new India and held many senior positions in government as well as represented India in international bodies. In 1968 he established Karimpur Pannadevi College at Karimpur, Nadia district.  Social activities  Sanyal was a modern personality and free thinker in his time. He married in 1924 with daughter of Sharat Chandra Bhattacharya of Baharampur without any rituals. He was strongly against dowry, castism, religious formalities. Even being a Brahmin he invited his Muslim friend Kazi Nazrul Islam to his marriage ceremony ignoring the social policing and restrictions.  Writings  Sanyal's book Development of Indian Railways is still considered a classic on railway transport and a primary source on the history of the Indian Railways. It was based on his Ph.D. thesis accepted by the University of London and was published by the University of Calcutta, 1930. The book is widely quoted in Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India's Geography by economist and writer Sanjeev Sanyal who is Nalinaksha Sanyal's great grandson.

It was the first aircraft to fly with controllable slots. Development Frederick Handley Page obtained his master patent for controllable slots on the edge of an aircraft wing on 24 October 1919. He knew the lift coefficient of all wings increased linearly until the stall was approached, then fell away; he argued that if the stall could be delayed, higher lift coefficients could be reached. In Germany Gustav Lachmann had the same idea, though through a wish to avoid the dangers of stalling. Rather than going to litigation an agreement was reached in which Lachmann, working with Prandtl at the advanced Goettingen air tunnel acted as consultant to Handley Page. Lachmann heard about the Handley Page work when they modified a standard DH.9A with fixed slots and demonstrated it dramatically at the Handley Page airfield at Cricklewood on 21 October 1920. That machine was retrospectively designated the H.P.17. The first aircraft with pilot controllable slots, designed by Handley Page and wind tunnel tested by Lachmann was called the X.4B in the company's contemporary notation but became, retrospectively, the H.P.20. The Air Ministry met the cost. Like the H.P.17 it used a D.H.9A engine, fuselage and empennage, but fitted with an entirely new wing.Flight 10 November 1921 p.732-3 The H.P.20 was a high-wing monoplane, using a thick wing with a straight leading edge but taper on the trailing edge. It was a semi- cantilever structure bolted to a small cabane on the fuselage and braced to the lower fuselage longerons with a pair of steeply rising struts on each side. The heaviness of early cantilever wing structures is shown by a comparison of the loaded weight of the H.P.20 (6,500 lb) with that of the loaded standard biplane DH.9A (4,645 lb including fuel for over 5 hours of flight and a 460 lb bomb load).Flight 1 June 1956 p.679 The undersurface was flat and the front edge cropped to allow the full span slats, when closed, to form the true leading edge. The slats were hinged ahead of the wing and at their leading edges; their rotation formed the slots. In addition, slots opened in front of the ailerons when they were lowered. This was done via a groove in the wing just in front of the aileron hinge, narrowing towards the top surface. The spans and wing areas of the DH.9A and H.P.20 were about the same, so the wing chord of the monoplane was about double that of the biplane. As a result, the tailing edge extended aft beyond the DH.9A's pilot's cockpit and so the H.P.20 was flown from what had been the gunner's position. There was a small cut-out in the trailing edge to enhance the pilot's view. As there was no upper wing to house the fuel, the H.P.20 had a slightly round-ended cylindrical tank mounted high over the centre section to provide gravity feed. Because high angles of attack were used in landing and take-off with the slots open, the undercarriage was lengthened, as it had been on the H.P.17. There was an airflow direction indicator mounted on a little boom which projected forward of the starboard wing. The H.P.20 was first flown with slots closed on 24 February 1921 at Cricklewood. About a month later it was flying with controllable slots. In one test it landed at 43 mphh (69 km/h) at a wing loading of 11 lb/ft2 (54 kg/m2), about the same as a Cessna 152. This corresponds to a lift coefficient of 1.17. Aerodynamic loads made the slats hard to operate reliably. After manufacturer's tests, the Air Ministry agreed to take on the aircraft, but the Ministry's pilot made a heavy landing at Cricklewood during acceptance flights and the H.P.20 remained there for repairs until final delivery in February 1922.

This technology also enables the police to capture evidence effectively. The aircraft is equipped with thermal imaging cameras for locating criminals and missing people. The helicopter may also be called on to transport people with life-threatening injuries to hospital, when the Great North Air Ambulance is unavailable. The helicopter unit has appeared on Channel 5's Interceptor programme alongside their ground-based colleagues.

Intended as a prototype for a new fleet of high-power electric locomotives to haul freight trains northward from Tokyo to Hokkaido, the sole member of the class, EF500-901, was built jointly by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Electric, and delivered to Shin-Tsurumi Depot in August 1990. The design was broadly based on the Class EF200 locomotives built for Tokaido Main Line freight duties west of Tokyo. Following initial test-running, the locomotive underwent long-term feasibility testing on freight services on the Tohoku Main Line. However, the locomotive fell foul of newly introduced government guidelines covering high- frequency electromagnetic noise emissions, and so fleet production was deemed unfeasible. JR Freight instead opted for the Class EH500 and Class EF510 locomotive designs. EF500-901 was transferred to Sendai Depot in 1996, but subsequently saw little use. It was formally withdrawn on 29 March 2002. The locomotive is stored at JR Freight's Hiroshima Depot.

The village culture is mainly based on Bhaishnav thoughts and the villagers worship Shri Chaitanya as an incarnation of both Sri Krishna and Radha. The great devotee of Shri Chaitanya, Sriman Radha Raman of Nadia had visited the village in 1900. Long ago a forest was present beside the village which is now limited to few acres only. Deforestation and no further plantation is the main cause for the ruin of the green land. The villagers mainly depend on agriculture as income source. Education facilities are not up to the mark in the village. Only a few students have achieved the higher qualification and placed in professional jobs.

She is particularly noted for her translations of the Danish children's author, Hans Christian Andersen, as well as for her critical reviews and essays. She was a recipient of the Eleanor Farjeon Award.  Early life  Born in Great Yarmouth to a Latvian Jewish father who was a herring exporter, she was the second of four siblings. Her mother was a talented artist and musician. Due to the antisemitism of the 1930s, the family took the mother's surname, Lewis. They moved to London's Red Lion Square in 1935, into the block of flats in which Naomi was to reside until her death. Having studied at the local Great Yarmouth High School, Naomi then went on to win a scholarship to read English at Westfield College, University of London.  Career  Following a number of jobs working as a teacher and a copywriter, she started her career as a writer after the Second World War by entering the weekly competitions run by the New Statesman. Quickly noticed by her contemporaries as an intelligent and insightful critic, she went on to produce regular articles for the New Statesman, as well as for The Observer, The Times Literary Supplement, the New York Times and the Listener. Her first published work, A Visit to Mrs. Wilcox (1957) included a selection of these articles and won immediate acclaim, becoming a Book Society recommendation. In an article published in Essays in Criticism (1951), Albert Gerard cites a sentence from her, indicating an invaluable comparison she made between Coleridge and Keats, a comparison that had not been made earlier than her time in essence the way she originally suggested: “modern judgement, it seems, can accept either Coleridge or Keats – not both.” Indeed, she was one of the first critics to elaborate on a specific aspect of modern thinking in that Coleridge was a man of ideas dealing with the abstract, the spiritual and the ideal, whereas Keats was a man of concrete experience and tangible sense of observation. She was thus one of the proponents of twentieth-century thought which states that spirituality and tangible senses had better be separated conceptually. Over the sixty years of her literary career, Naomi Lewis produced a vast number of works; as a reviewer, an anthologist and as a poet in her own right. Notable amongst these was A Footprint on the Air (1983) an anthology of nature verse named after her own poem and Messages (1985), a celebrated collection of poetry which included three of her own original poems: The Wolf said to Francis (under the pseudonym A. G. Rochelle), Counsel and Creatures of Early Morning. In 2000, Messages was chosen by the U.K's first Children's Laureate, Quentin Blake, as one of his fifty favourite books (The Laureate's Party, Random House). Naomi herself was particularly fond of the 1993 publication The Mardi Gras Cat, in which she presented a carefully selected gallery of feline personalities, each immortalised in poetry. Naomi Lewis taught poetry appreciation and creative writing at London's City Literary Institute for many years, and due to popular demand went on doing so well past the official age of retirement. Some of the poems produced in that class were included in Messages, alongside lifelong favourites Robert Browning, Stevie Smith and Emily Dickinson. She also lectured periodically at the South Place Ethical Society, where she was a long-time member. Among the various subjects were talks on her favourite children's authors Hans Christian Andersen and Andrew Lang and the Italian author and holocaust survivor Primo Levi, whose work she championed from its first publication in the UK.  Personal life  Lewis was a vegan and a committed animal advocate. Opposed to all forms of animal mistreatment, she once complained in a letter to the Evening Standard, \\"What moral right have humans to lay on sensitive creatures the sufferings of their own vanity, greed and cowardice, and a host of various sins?\\" Due to her habit of rescuing stray cats and injured pigeons around her home her Bloomsbury neighbourhood, she was featured on the BBC programme London Identities and made the subject of a national newspaper article. She used to take the injured pigeons to the restrooms at Conway Hall to give them a safe space to practice flying.  Awards  Naomi Lewis was honoured with the Eleanor Farjeon Award for services to children's literature in 1975 and by her election as Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1981.

Plot One of Bob Hunt's (Hays) neighbours' electricity is cut off because she cannot pay the bill. She is assisted by contributions, and the bill is paid entirely in pennies, though the clerk is belatedly told that payment is not accepted in such a large quantity of coins. Unfortunately, the electric company fails to reconnect the power due to a communications snafu, and the elderly woman is taken to hospital suffering hypothermia. Hunt sets off on a vendetta of revenge, sabotaging assorted support systems. Attempting to evade detection at one site, he flattens himself against the wall with wet paint, with a finger sticking up, and leaving the impression of a hand with one raised finger in the paint. The news media find out this detail and the unknown saboteur is nicknamed \\"The Finger.\\" When the phone company is hit, it issues a public statement denying that, due to the sabotage to its billing records, long-distance calls can be made without a charge. Promptly, the movie depicts people making outrageous use of long distance, which in 1981 was still quite expensive. One girl calls overseas and plays a musical composition over the phone. In a long, climactic courtroom hearing, a rate-hike proposal by Kenneth Knight and his utility company, Eastern Gas & Electric, is to be voted on by a public commission. But first a number of protesting citizens are given an opportunity to speak, followed by Hunt, who confesses: \\"I am The Finger.\\" At that point, many others in the courtroom, Spartacus-style, rise to claim they are The Finger. Just as the commission is about to approve E, G & E's rate increase, police officer Marion Edwards bursts in, there to make an arrest. Hunt expects to be placed in handcuffs, but she reveals that Knight has been destroying his own substations in an effort to achieve public sympathy.

The company was founded by a group of ex-Marshall employees, most notably Bruce Keir, the current technical Director at Blackstar and former Chief Design Engineer at Marshall, Ian Robinson. In 2009 the company began operations in the United States. The majority of the research and development for Blackstar is carried out in the UK. Blackstar is endorsed by major artists like Ozzy Osbourne, Kurt Viehdorfer, Neal Schon, Opeth, Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi. Blackstar has been consistently ranked amongst the best amplification brands by leading guitarists and industry observers. Amplifiers Artisan Series The Artisan series, designed in the UK, is manufactured in Korea with point-to-point tagboard construction. The dual channel amplifier uses pre-amp valves (most specifically the EF86 pentode) that are associated with smaller Vox amps. The range includes 15, 30, and 100-watt models in both head and combo form. The 15 and 30-watt combos were called \\"substantial amps that provide substantial tones\\" in Vintage Guitar. Series One The Blackstar Series One range offers more features than the Artisan range. Some models have four channels. It offers a patented 'ISF' (Infinite Shape Feature), which alters the saturation to sound either 'American' or 'British', or anywhere in between. The range includes 45, 50, 100, and 200-watt models. HT Venue Blackstar 3 HT CLUB 40 Launched in 2010 at the Winter NAMM, Blackstar introduced a new line of HT amplifiers. This line is essentially the same as the HT-5 series, but with more power. The models contain 20, 40, 50, 60, and 100 watt amplifiers. All models except the 50W and 100W are available in combo form. The 50W and 100W is head only, and the 20W comes in either head or combo. The HT Venue series also contains three different cabinet sizes: 1×12, 2×12, and 4×12. All speakers in the HT Venue are Celestion. This product range was discontinued in 2017, and replaced by HT Venue MkII. HT Venue MkII Launched in 2017, this product range is redesign of the original HT Venue series along with modern updates such as USB and D.I. recording via an XLR output. Following more than 3 years of intensive R&D; and market research, Blackstar released this update to the award-winning HT Venue line, stating that these products 'take the range to a new level of sonic performance, whilst adding every major enhancement that guitarists have requested; resulting in a massively flexible feature set that is still intuitive and musician-friendly.' These products were well received during the initial release, and have gone on to win numerous awards across various publications. HT Metal Blackstar's alternative range to the HT Venue range - clearly designed for Metal music and play-styles. Heads come in 1, 5, and 100 watt formats, and 1, 5, and 60 watt in combo format. These amps carry the signature ISF and emulated output of Blackstar amps. The 1 and 5 watt formats have 2 channels, while the 60 and 100 watt formats have 3 channels. These amps boast \\"extreme gain and tone\\", and are \\"Voiced for Metal- Hundreds of hours of technical development and focussed listening tests have resulted in the ultimate gigging metal head.\\" This line of amplifiers was released at Musicmesse 2013. This product range was discontinued in 2017. ID:Series Blackstar's line of digital programmable amplifiers available in 60 and 100 watt head format and 15, 30, 60 and 120 watt combo format.

Having ISF and EQ features in common with some of the pedals, the HT-5 also includes an emulated output to provide a valve sound for recording without the need for a microphone. The HT-1 is essentially a 1 watt version of the HT-5. It is also available in head-cab format, with a matching 60 watt cabinet.Blackstar ID Core 40 V2 Fly 3 The Fly 3 is a series of 3 watt compact amplifiers powered by batteries or an external supply. It is available in three types: for electric guitar featuring switchable distortion, ISF (see above) and digital echo; acoustic guitar with switchable EQ and delay; and bass with sub- bass control and a compressor. All three versions can be used with a stereo extension speaker or for 'MP3 playback'. Effect pedals Blackstar produces guitar pedals for boost, overdrive, distortion, distx, modulation, reverb, delay, dual and metal.

Possessing a fine coloratura soprano voice with a range of three octaves, music critics believed she was Jenny Lind's successor and dubbed her \\"the new Swedish Nightingale\\".Biography of Sigrid Arnoldson at hbdirect.com Her voice is preserved on several recordings made in Berlin for the Gramophone Company between 1906 and 1910. Biography Born in Stockholm, Arnoldson was taught by her father Carl Oskar Arnoldson, a respected tenor, and by Fritz Arlberg, a famous Swedish baritone. She later had further studies in Paris. She made her professional opera debut in 1885 at the Prague National Theatre as Rosina in Gioachino Rossini's The Barber of Seville. The part became her calling card at a number of important houses, including her first and very successful appearances at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow in 1886. That same year The Musical Times reported that Franz Liszt had predicted \\"a brilliant career\\" for her.Musical Times, Aug 1, 1886, p488 Arnoldson made her London debut in 1887 in Gioachino Rossini's The Barber of Seville at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane along with Fernando de Lucia, Mattia Battistini and Edouard de Reszke. As Rosina, she was said to be \\"Young, pretty, and of engaging manner, with a good voice and method, and considerable talent as an actress\\" and to have \\"won public favour with the greatest of ease\\".Musical Times, Jul 1, 1887, p407 Apart from a poorly received Zerlina (Don Giovanni) in 1887,Musical Times, Aug 1, 1887, p475 her success there was considerable, and she was engaged to sing at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden in 1888 and again between 1892 and 1894.Gramophone, June 1942, p12 The Musical Times called her Cherubino (The Marriage of Figaro) \\"charming\\",Musical Times, Aug 1, 1892, p473 and her work as George Fox's Nydia in the eponymous opera \\"a graceful impersonation\\"Musical Times, Aug 1, 1892, p474 She was engaged in 1890 by the Max Strakosch for an American tour of some 60 concerts for the sum of 250,000 Francs.Musical Times, Feb 1, 1890, p107 Her Barcelona debut at the Liceu in 1891 was reported as being \\"most enthusiastically received\\".Musical Times, Feb 1, 1891, p108 She debuted at the Metropolitan Opera in New York as Baucis in Philémon et Baucis in 1893, despite the fact that in 1892 it had been reported that \\"her voice was smaller than ever\\".Musical Times, Jun 1, 1892, p342 In 1897 she is recorded as having sung two \\"hackneyed show pieces\\" at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert in London, which were \\"rapturously applauded\\"Musical Times, Jun 1, 1897, p385 yet earlier that year she was appearing with \\"immense success\\" at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg in Italian opera.Musical Times, May 1, 1897, p337 1898 saw her giving a series of performances at the Berlin State Opera.Musical Times, Jul1, 1898, p484 As late as 1906 she achieved a \\"triumph\\" at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo in Anton Rubinstein's The Demon.Musical Times, May 1, 1906, p343 Arnoldson's other roles included Elsa from Richard Wagner's Lohengrin, Nedda in Pagliacci, Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro, Papagena in The Magic Flute, Oscar in Un ballo in maschera, Marguerite de Valois in Les Huguenots, and Sophie in Werther with Jean de Reszke. She also portrayed both Micaëla and the title heroine in Georges Bizet's Carmen. She sang the latter impersonation as a last-minute substitute for an indisposed Emma Calvé at Covent Garden in 1903. She had never sung the role before or ever intended to assail it onstage. She did, however, know the music, as she was accustomed to learning all the parts within the operas she sang in. The performance was later called by Gramophone her \\"solitary failure\\"; but given the circumstances of the performance that judgement seems ungenerous. By 1910 Arnoldson was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. She retired from the stage in 1911, after which she taught singing in Vienna for over 25 years. She moved to Stockholm in 1938 where she continued to teach up until her death in 1943.

Middle Ages Early Middle Ages In early Middle Ages what is now Scotland was culturally and politically divided. In the West were the Gaelic-speaking people of Dál Riata, who had close links with Ireland, from where they brought with them the name Scots.J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser, eds, The Medieval State: essays presented to James Campbell (London: Continuum, 2000), , p. 48. Very few works of Gaelic poetry survive from the early Medieval period, and most of these are in Irish manuscripts.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-CLIO, 2006), , p. 1576. There are religious works that can be identified as Scottish, including the Elegy for St Columba by Dallan Forgaill (c. 597) and \\"In Praise of St Columba\\" by Beccan mac Luigdech of Rum, c. 677.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-CLIO, 2006), , p. 999. A series of anecdotes contained in the tenth century Betba Adamnáin (Life of St. Adomnán) are probably derived from works composed on Iona. Outside of these there are a few poems in praise of Pictish kings contained within Irish annals that are probably from Scotland. Beginning in the later eighth century, Viking raids and invasions may have forced a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns. The Kingdom of Alba emerged, which would eventually become known as the Kingdom of Scotland, and traced its origin to Cínaed mac Ailpín (Kenneth MacAlpin) in the 840s through the House of Alpin.B. Yorke, The Conversion of Britain: Religion, Politics and Society in Britain c.600-800 (Pearson Education, 2006), , p. 54. The Kingdom of Alba was overwhelmingly an oral society dominated by Gaelic culture. Fuller sources for Ireland of the same period suggest that there would have been filidh, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passed on their knowledge and culture in Gaelic to the next generation.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600–1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 76. High Middle Ages At least from the accession of David I (r. 1124–53), as part of a Davidian Revolution that introduced French culture and political systems, Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court and was probably replaced by French. After this \\"de-gallicisation\\" of the Scottish court, a less highly regarded order of bards took over the functions of the filidh, and they would continue to act in a similar role in the Highlands and Islands into the eighteenth century. They often trained in bardic schools. A few of these, like the one run by the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were bards to the Lord of the Isles,K. M. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from the Reformation to the Revolutions (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 220. continued until they were suppressed from the seventeenth century. Members of bardic schools were trained in the complex rules and forms of Gaelic poetry. Much of their work was never written down, and what survives was only recorded from the sixteenth century.R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: A History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), . It is possible that more Middle Irish literature was written in Medieval Scotland than is often thought, but has not survived because the Gaelic literary establishment of eastern Scotland died out before the fourteenth century. Thomas Owen Clancy has argued that the Lebor Bretnach, the so-called \\"Irish Nennius\\", was written in Scotland, and probably at the monastery in Abernethy, but this text survives only from manuscripts preserved in Ireland.T. O. Clancy, \\"Scotland, the 'Nennian' recension of the Historia Brittonum, and the Lebor Bretnach\\", in S. Taylor, ed., Kings, Clerics and Chronicles in Scotland, 500–1297 (Dublin/Portland, 2000), , pp. 87-107. Other literary works that have survived include that of the prolific poet Gille Brighde Albanach. His Heading for Damietta (c. 1218) dealt with his experiences of the Fifth Crusade.T. O. Clancy, ed., The Triumph Tree: Scotland's Earliest Poetry, 550–1350 (Edinburgh, 1998). pp. 247-283. Late Middle Ages In the late Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the dominant language of the country. It was derived largely from Old English, with the addition of elements from Gaelic and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century onwards.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 60–7. As the ruling elite gradually abandoned French, they began to adopt Middle Scots, and by the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I (1406–37) onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline. Lowland writers began to treat Gaelic as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands. The major corpus of Medieval Scottish Gaelic poetry, The Book of the Dean of Lismore was compiled by the brothers James and Donald MacGregor in the early decades of the sixteenth century. Beside Scottish Gaelic verse it contains a large number of poems composed in Ireland as well as verse and prose in Scots and Latin. The subject matter includes love poetry, heroic ballads and philosophical pieces. It also is notable for containing poetry by at least four women.J. T. Koch and A. Minard, The Celts: History, Life, and Culture (ABC-CLIO, 2012), , pp. 262–3. These include Aithbhreac Nighean Coirceadail (f. 1460), who wrote a lament for her husband, the constable of Castle Sween.J. T. Koch and A. Minard, The Celts: History, Life, and Culture (ABC-CLIO, 2012), , pp. 33–4. Walter Kennedy (d. 1518?), one of the makars associated with the court of James IV, may have written works in the language, although only examples of his poetry in Scots survive. The Book of Common Order was translated into Scottish Gaelic by Séon Carsuel (John Carswell), Bishop of the Isles, and printed in 1567. This is considered the first printed book in Scottish Gaelic though the language resembles classical Irish. Early Modern Era By the early modern era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 60-1. The tradition of classic Gaelic poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland, with the last fully competent member of the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were hereditary poets to the Lords of the Isles and then the Donalds of Clanranald, still working in the early eighteenth century. Nevertheless, interest in the sponsorship of panegyric Gaelic poetry was declining among the clan leaders.J. MacDonald, \\"Gaelic literature\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 255-7. Gaelic was gradually being overtaken by Middle Scots, which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. Middle Scots was derived substantially from Old English, with Gaelic and French influences. It was usually called Inglyshe and was very close to the language spoken in northern England, Unlike many of his predecessors, James VI actively despised Gaelic culture.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 40. As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women,K. Chedgzoy, Women's Writing in the British Atlantic World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), , p. 105. such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615-1707). Iain Lom (c. 1624–c. 1710) was a Royalist Scottish Gaelic poet appointed poet laureate in Scotland by Charles II at the Restoration. He delivered a eulogy for the coronation, and remained loyal to the Stuarts after 1688, opposing the Williamites and later, in his vituperative Oran an Aghaidh an Aonaidh, the 1707 Union of the Parliaments. Eighteenth century The Gaelic inscription plaque on the memorial to the poet Duncan Ban MacIntyre, born in 1724 at Druim Liaghart and who died in 1812. The use of Scottish Gaelic suffered when Highlanders were persecuted after the Battle of Culloden in 1746, and during the Highland Clearances. The Scottish Gaelic Enlightenment figure Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair compiled the first secular book in Scottish Gaelic to be printed: Leabhar a Theagasc Ainminnin (1741), a Gaelic- English glossary. The second secular book in Scottish Gaelic to be published was his poetry collection Ais-Eiridh na Sean Chánoin Albannaich (The Resurrection of the Ancient Scottish Language). His lexicography and poetry was informed by his study of old Gaelic manuscripts, an antiquarian interest which also influenced the orthography he employed. As an observer of the natural world of Scotland and a Jacobite rebel, Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair was the most overtly nationalist poet in Gaelic of the 18th century. His Ais-Eiridh na Sean Chánoin Albannaich was reported to have been burned in public by the hangman in Edinburgh. He was influenced by James Thomson's The Seasons as well as by Gaelic \\"village poets\\" such as Iain Mac Fhearchair (John MacCodrum). As part of the oral literature of the Highlands, few of the works of such village poets were published at the time, although some have been collected since. Scottish Gaelic poets produced laments on the Jacobite defeats of 1715 and 1745. Mairghread nighean Lachlainn and Catriona Nic Fhearghais are among woman poets who reflected on the crushing effects on traditional Gaelic culture of the aftermath of the Jacobite uprisings. A consequent sense of desolation pervaded the works of Scottish Gaelic writers such as Dughall Bochanan which mirrored many of the themes of the graveyard poets writing in England. A legacy of Jacobite verse was later compiled (and adapted) by James Hogg in his Jacobite Reliques (1819). Donnchadh Bàn Mac an t-Saoir (usually Duncan Ban MacIntyre in English; 20 March 1724 - 14 May 1812)Calder, George (editor and translator). The Gaelic Songs of Duncan MacIntyre. Edinburgh: John Grant, 1912. is one of the most renowned of Scottish Gaelic poets and formed an integral part of one of the golden ages of Gaelic poetry in Scotland during the 18th century. He is best known for his poem about Beinn Dorain; \\"Moladh Beinn Dòbhrain\\" (English: \\"Praise of Ben Doran\\"). Most of his poetry is descriptive and the influence of Alasdair MacMhaighstir Alasdair is notable in much of it. Despite the Jacobite upheavals during his lifetime, it was his experience as a gamekeeper in Argyll and Perthshire in the employ of the Duke of Argyll which had greatest impact upon his poetry. Moladh Beinn Dòbhrain, stems from this period. The significance of Duncan Bàn's nature themed poetry is such that it has, along with that of MacMhaighstir Alasdair, been described as \\"the zenith of Gaelic nature poetry\\".Gaelic Song - An Introduction The Ossian of James Macpherson James Macpherson (1736–96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by Ossian, he published translations from the Gaelic that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, influencing Herder and Goethe. Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience. Bible translation An Irish Gaelic translation of the Bible dating from the Elizabethan period, but revised in the 1680s, was in use until the Bible was translated into Scottish Gaelic. Author David Ross notes in his 2002 history of Scotland that a Scottish Gaelic version of the Bible was published in London in 1690 by the Rev. Robert Kirk, minister of Aberfoyle; however it was not widely circulated.Ross, David. Scotland: History of a Nation. Geddes & Grosset, 2002. The first well-known translation of the Bible into modern Scottish Gaelic was begun in 1767 when Dr James Stuart of Killin and Dugald Buchanan of Rannoch produced a translation of the New Testament. Very few European languages have made the transition to a modern literary language without an early modern translation of the Bible. The lack of a well-known translation until the late 18th century may have contributed to the decline of Scottish Gaelic. Nineteenth century The Highland Clearances and widespread emigration significantly weakened Gaelic language and culture and had a profound impact on the nature of Gaelic poetry. The best poetry in this vein contained a strong element of protest, including Uilleam Mac Dhun Lèibhe's (William Livingstone, 1808–70) protest against the Islay clearances in \\"Fios Thun a' Bhard\\" (\\"A Message for the Poet\\") and Seonaidh Phàdraig Iarsiadair's (John Smith, 1848–81) long emotional condemnation of those responsible for the clearances Spiord a' Charthannais. In Sutherland, Eòghainn MacDhonnchaidh (Ewan Robertson, 1842-95) of Tongue was called \\"the Bard of the Clearances\\"; he was known for his song \\"Mo Mhallachd aig na Caoraich Mhòr\\" (also called \\"Duthaich Mhic Aoidh,\\") which strongly criticises the protagonists of the Sutherland Clearances. The best known Gaelic poet of the era was Màiri Mhòr nan Òran (Mary MacPherson, 1821–98), whose verse was criticised for a lack of intellectual weight, but which embodies the spirit of the land agitation of the 1870s and 1880s and whose evocation of place and mood has made her among the most enduring Gaelic poets. Emigration also resulted in Gaelic-speaking communities abroad, most notably Canada, which produced a very large quantity of Gaelic literature. Canadians made sense of their relationship to their homeland as a diaspora in both romantic poetry praising their \\"an t-Seann Dùthaich\\" (English: \\"the Old Country\\") and political songs about the Highland Clearances. Many songs, such as \\"O mo dhùthaich,\\" contain both themes. Ewen MacLachlan translated the first eight books of Homer's Iliad into Scottish Gaelic. He also composed and published his own Gaelic Attempts in Verse (1807) and Metrical Effusions (1816), and contributed greatly to the 1828 Gaelic–English Dictionary. The poetry of Allan MacDonald (1859–1905) is mainly religious in nature. He composed hymns and verse in honour of the Blessed Virgin, the Christ Child, and the Eucharist. However, several secular poems and songs were also composed by him. In some of these, MacDonald praises the beauty of Eriskay and its people. In his verse drama, Parlamaid nan Cailleach (The Old Wives' Parliament), he lampoons the gossiping of his female parishioners and local marriage customs. Twentieth century  The revitalisation of Gaelic poetry in the twentieth century, known as the Scottish Gaelic Renaissance was largely due to the work of Sorley Maclean (Somhairle MacGill-Eain, 1911–96). A native of Raasay and a native Gaelic speaker, he abandoned the stylistic conventions of the tradition and opened up new possibilities for composition with his poem Dàin do Eimhir (Poems to Eimhir, 1943). His work inspired a new generation to take up nea bhardachd (the new poetry). These included George Campbell Hay (Deòrsa Mac Iain Dheòrsa, 1915–1984), Lewis-born poets Derick Thomson (Ruaraidh MacThòmais, 1921–2012) and Iain Crichton Smith (Iain Mac a' Ghobhainn, 1928–98). They all focused on the issues of exile, the fate of the Gaelic language and bi-culturalism. Dòmhnall Ruadh Chorùna was a Scottish Gaelic poet who served in the First World War, and as a war poet described the use of poison gas in his poem Òran a' Phuinnsuin (\\"Song of the Poison\\"). His poetry is part of oral literature, as he himself never learnt to read and write in his native language. Domhnall Ruadh Choruna, (1995), page xlv. Aonghas MacNeacail (Angus Nicolson, b. 1942), amongst the most prominent post-war Gaelic poets, was influenced by new American poetry, particularly the Black Mountain School.R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: A History of Scottish Literature] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), , p. 653. The 1960s and 1970s also saw the flourishing of Scottish Gaelic drama. Key figures included Iain Crichton Smith, whose plays explored wide-ranging themes. Often humorous, they also dealt with serious topics such as the betrayal of Christ in An Coileach (A Cockerel, 1966) of the Highland Clearances in A' Chùirt (The Court, 1966).I. Brown, \\"Processes and interactive events: theatre and Scottish devolution\\", in S. Blandford, ed., Theatre and Performance in Small Nations (Bristol: Interlect, 2013), pp. 37-8. Iain Moireach's plays also used humour to deal with serious subjects, as in Feumaidh Sinn a Bhith Gàireachdainn (We Have to Laugh, 1969), which focused on threats to the Gaelic language. Other major figures included Tormod Calum Dòmhnallach (1927–2000), whose work included Anna Chaimbeul (Anna Campbell, 1977), which was influenced by Japanese Noh theatre. Fionnlagh MacLeòid's (Finley Macleod) work included Ceann Cropic (1967), which was strongly influenced by the theatre of the absurd. Similarly, Donaidh MacIlleathain (Donnie Maclean), made use of absurd dialogue in An Sgoil Dhubh (A Dark School, 1974). Many of these authors continued writing into the 1980s and even the 1990s, but this was something of a golden age for Gaelic drama that has not been matched.M. Mcleod and M. Watson, \\"In the shadow of the bard: the Gaelic short story, novel and drama\\", in I. Brown, ed., The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Modern transformations: new identities (from 1918) (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 282. The first novel in Scottish Gaelic was John MacCormick's Dùn-Àluinn, no an t-Oighre 'na Dhìobarach, which was serialised in the People's Journal in 1910, before publication in book form in 1912. The publication of a second Scottish Gaelic novel, An t-Ogha Mòr by Angus Robertson, followed within a year.THE FORGOTTEN FIRST: JOHN MACCORMICK’S DÙN-ÀLUINN Modern Gaelic poetry has been most influenced by Symbolism, transmitted via poetry in English, and by Scots poetry. Traditional Gaelic poetry utilised an elaborate system of metres, which modern poets have adapted to their own ends. George Campbell Hay looks back beyond the popular metres of the 19th and 20th centuries to forms of early Gaelic poetry. Donald MacAuley's poetry is concerned with place and community. The following generation of Gaelic poets writing at the end of the 20th century lived in a bilingual world to a greater extent than any other generation, with their work most often accompanied in publication by a facing text in English. Such confrontation has inspired semantic experimentation, seeking new contexts for words, and going as far as the explosive and neologistic verse of Fearghas MacFhionnlaigh (1948- ). Scottish Gaelic poetry has been the subject of translation not only into English, but also into other Celtic languages: Maoilios Caimbeul and Màiri NicGumaraid have been translated into Irish, and John Stoddart has produced anthologies of Gaelic poetry translated into Welsh. Today Scottish Gaelic literature is currently undergoing a revival. In the first half of the 20th century only about four or five books in Gaelic were published each year. Since the 1970s this number has increased to over 40 titles per year.http://sapphire.ac.uk/40-years-of- scottish-publishing,-1974-2014 With regard to Gaelic poetry this includes the Great Book of Gaelic, An Leabhar Mòr, a Scottish Gaelic, English and Irish language collaboration featuring the work of 150 poets, visual artists and calligraphers.Leabhar Mor website summary of book Established contemporary poets in Scottish Gaelic include Meg Bateman, Maoilios Caimbeul, Rody Gorman, Aonghas MacNeacail and Angus Peter Campbell. Marcas Mac an Tuairneir, an award-winning poet cemented the place of second-language Gaelic learners and gay people in his 2014 collection, Deò. Gaelic prose has expanded also, particularly with the development since 2003 of the Ùr-sgeul series published by CLÀR, which encourages new works of Gaelic fiction by both established and new writers. Angus Peter Campbell, besides three Scottish Gaelic poetry collections, has produced five Gaelic novels: An Oidhche Mus Do Sheol Sinn (2003), Là a' Deanamh Sgeil Do Là (2004), An Taigh-Samhraidh (2006), Tilleadh Dhachaigh (2009) and Fuaran Ceann an t-Saoghail (2011). Other established fiction writers include Alasdair Caimbeul and his brother Tormod, Catrìona Lexy Chaimbeul, Alison Lang, Dr Finlay MacLeod, Iain F. MacLeod, Norma MacLeod, Mary Anne MacDonald and Duncan Gillies. New fiction writers include Mairi E. MacLeod and the writers of the An Claigeann Damien Hirst (Ùr-sgeul, 2009) and Saorsa (Ùr-sgeul, 2011) anthologies. In 2013, the first ever Scottish Gaelic hard science fiction novel, Air Cuan Dubh Drilseach by Tim Armstrong, was published by CLÀR. Within Gaelic drama, two Gaelic theatre companies were recently professionally active: Fir Chlis and Tosg, which was managed by the late Simon MacKenzie.Simon MacKenzie Scotsman obituary Most recently, the Gaelic drama group Tog-I, established by Arthur Donald, has attempted to revive the sector.

The company builds guitars using traditional methods – no modern computer-controlled machinery or serial production methods are used. Each guitar is built individually by a luthier. Ruokangas Guitars is a privately held corporation, solely owned by Master Luthier Juha Ruokangas. History 1995 – Juha Ruokangas founds the company as a sole trader and rents a small workshop facility in Finland, Hyvinkää at Wanha Villatehdas, building and repairing guitars. 1996 – Juha starts using moose shin bone as nut material in all his guitars and repairwork. 1997 – The website ruokangas.com is published, and the first Ruokangas guitar model – the Duke – is launched. Juha experiments with Spanish Cedar (Cedrela odorata) as the body and neckwood – a tonewood not commonly used in electric guitars. Spanish Cedar is to become one of the fundamental characteristics of Ruokangas Guitars. 1998 – Juha participates in a thermo treatment project (a Finnish invention), funded by the European Union. Thermo treated tonewood becomes a common feature in Ruokangas guitars. The method slowly becomes popular in other parts of the world, too. In the North America thermo treated wood is often referred to with such trade names as roasted, torrefied or caramelised wood. 1999 – Juha starts co-operation with fellow craftsmen Mika Koskinen and Jiri Kaarmela, who are to become part owners of the company two years later, along with luthier Jarkko Lindholm, who joins the team in 2000, but leaves a year later to work on his own Lindholm Musical Instruments. Juha designs and launches new variations of the Duke theme and introduces another uncommon local material – the Arctic Birch tops. 2000 – Juha designs and launches the second Ruokangas model – VSOP, built of thermo treated Alder and Rock Maple – and attends the Frankfurt Musikmesse for the first time. 2001 – Luthier Jyrki Kostamo joins the Ruokangas team. The company format changes from sole trader to privately held corporation. The first dealerships are confirmed and Ruokangas is reviewed in guitar magazines more regularly. Ruokangas proprietary pickups (manufactured by Harry Häussel in Germany) are launched. 2003 – Ruokangas Guitars publishes a new website design with online guitar configurator tool (based on an idea by Jarkko Lindholm) developed by graphics designer Junnu Vuorela, where one can visually choose colors, pickups, woods and parts online. Such configurators were rare at the time, the Japanese Kisekae Guitar Creator being the first internationally known commercial version (launched in 2000), but later on such tools have gained more popularity, as the technology has become more readily available and network speed has increased. 2004 – Luthier Tomi Nivala joins the Ruokangas team. Junnu Vuorela wins the MindTrek Award for productive innovations with the Ruokangas website design. Ruokangas launches a new guitar model – the Mojo. Ruokangas licences the Buzz Feiten Tuning System. 2005 – Ruokangas Guitars attends The NAMM Show for the first time. Master's degree becomes available for luthiers in Finland.

Ruokangas Guitars celebrates 10th Anniversary. 2006 – Luthier Emma Elftorp, from Sweden, joins the Ruokangas team. 2007 – Ruokangas Guitars attends the Fuzz Guitar Show in Gothenburg, Sweden. Co- operation with True Temperament company starts. 2008 – The Hellcat, a new guitar model, is introduced. Ruokangas joins Facebook. Juha and Emma launch \\"The Project Unicorn\\" – new guitar design process open to public via YouTube. Unicorn Classic model, introduced in 2009 2009 – The Unicorn guitar model is introduced. Also the first Ruokangas bass model - the Steambass - is introduced. Juha receives his Master Luthier degree. Ruokangas is invited to exhibit at Montreal Guitar Show (discontinued in 2013), the annual high end event for the finest guitars in the world. Juha becomes one of the founding members (and the first chairman of the board) of The Guild Of Finnish Luthiers (Suomen Soitinrakentajien Kilta). 2010 – The 4th employee, luthier Lari Lätti joins the Ruokangas team. The new Ruokangas website (developed by Juha Javanainen and Junnu Vuorela) and iPhone application (developed by MK&C; in cooperation with Junnu Vuorela is launched in January. The website gets an Honorary Award in the Grand One 2010 competition – the Best Information Design category. Ruokangas exhibits again at the Montreal Guitar Show (MGS), and the show organization Salon de Guitare de Montréal orders a Ruokangas guitar to their Ste-Cat Collection. This is the first European guitar in the collection. 2011 – The Ruokangas workshop moves from Hyvinkää to the historic Manor of Harviala in Janakkala. Exhibits and co-organizes the first ever Turenki Tonefest.

Other West Slavic tribes such as the Milceni settled east of them. About 850 the Bavarian Geographer located a Talaminzi (Dala-Daleminzi) settlement area east of the Sorbs. According to later chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, the people called themselves Glomacze after a central cult site, a now dry lake near the present-day town of Lommatzsch. The first known account about the Glomacze is from 805 when they were raided by the troops of Frankish king Charles the Younger on his way to Bohemia. The actual conquest of the tribe started in early 929 by the German king Henry the Fowler who, as Widukind of Corvey reported, seized and destroyed their main castle called Gana at the Siege of Gana (probably located near present-day Stauchitz), exterminated the defenders and had a fortress erected on the hill of Meissen (Mišno). Their settlement area was incorporated into the large Saxon Marca Geronis and in 965 became part of the Margraviate of Meissen.

It is about 35 hectares (86 acres) in area. Brent: Gladstone Park Dollis Hill House was an early 19th-century farmhouse, located within the northern boundary of the park. Transport Crossing the Dudding Hill Line in late Victorian times, near the eastern end of the now-closed Dudding Hill railway station, and at the western end of Gladstone Park Dollis Hill tube station on the London Underground Jubilee line is about a 10-minute walk away from the park, to the south-west. Cricklewood Thameslink station is to the east. Bus services also run through the area. The park is situated on both sides of the Dudding Hill Line. This railway is currently only used by freight trains, but it has been subject to various railway schemes over the years, including a recent proposal for a radial North and West London Light railway (NWLLR), which might result in a light-rail stop being built at one or both ends of the park. There is a footbridge over the railway at the western end of the park, and a private road bridge (only used by Brent Parks Service) at the eastern end.The Times Comment on NWLLR light-rail proposal History Map showing the park's location (OpenStreetMap) It was chiefly the loss of sports grounds at Neasden by the arrival of the Great Central Railway towards the end of the 19th century that motivated local public backing for a new park at Dollis Hill. Hence, there was very strong support at Neasden for the idea that the District Council should buy from the Finch family the part of their estate that lay south of Dollis Hill Lane, for £50,000. However, considerable opposition to the proposal, mainly on cost grounds, arose from other parts of Willesden, largely driven by the editor of the Willesden Chronicle from his office in South Kilburn. Gladstone Park c.1900 In the end the issue was resolved at an inquiry held by an inspector from the Local Government Board. He recommended acquisition of the land. Middlesex County Council agreed conditionally to put up £12,500 towards the cost; London County Council, £3,000; Hampstead £1,000; and Hendon £500, while the Ecclesiastical Commissioners made a £5,000 loan available on easy terms. The Municipal Borough of Willesden was left to find the rest of the money from their ratepayers and from donations. It would eventually cost nearly £52,000. William Gladstone The contract to purchase the house, garden, and estate from \\"Robert Augustus Finch and others\\" was signed by the Council on 9 August 1899, and soon afterwards, notices to terminate existing tenancies (except that for the house and gardens) were sent out. Despite some reservations by local Conservatives, on 12 December 1899 it was formally agreed to name the park after William Ewart Gladstone, the old Prime Minister who had died the previous year, and who had spent many happy hours there. Purchase was completed early in 1900. The Earl of Rosebery, recently twice Prime Minister, had promised to perform the opening ceremony on Saturday 25 May 1901, but was prevented from attending by the death of his mother. In his absence, the park was declared open by the Earl of Aberdeen. Design Copy of map of park taken from the land purchase document. The route of the Dudding Hill Line railway is obvious, and widens at the western end, at Dudding Hill station Once it had been agreed that Gladstone Park should become a reality, the main planning was handed over to Oliver Claude Robson, the District Council Surveyor who was to serve for 43 years, from 1875 to 1918. Robson's first major pleasure ground project had been the nearby Roundwood Park which had opened in 1895, and where he had to convert poorly drained farmland. The much larger Gladstone Park was to prove a rather less challenging undertaking. It was decided to leave the northern part of new park in its \\"original and natural beauty\\", and devote the section south of the railway to sports. The latter was to prove useful to Robson since it was levelled with slop (road refuse), for which he was always short of landfill sites. Hedges and ditches dividing these southern fields were obliterated, but some trees were left standing. Robson had little laying out work to do but provided boundary fencing, a children's playground (gymnasium), 103 seats, conveniences, stabling, pavilions for football and cricket clubs, water supply, and 2900 feet of roadways. All the old farm ponds on the estate were filled in to depth not exceeding 2 feet for safety reasons, and some later converted to children's paddling pools. (These subsequently became a problem to the Council, perhaps for health reasons, and were dispensed with in 1920). Cleverly, Robson waited for the public to mark out what he called \\"trespass paths\\" across the park before converting them to metalled pathways. Some plantations in Roundwood Park were thinned and the surplus trees transplanted at Gladstone Park. Hundreds of plane trees were set along the pathways. A major event for Willesden was the provision of its first public swimming bath (now closed), which Robson designed in 1902. According to the Willesden Guide 1905/6, the cost was £2569 6s 5d. It was based on Harrow School swimming bath, which representatives of the Council had visited and approved. All the construction work, which commenced on 2 March 1903, was carried out by the Engineer's Department without the intervention of a contractor, thus providing work for the local unemployed. By 1908/9, Robson had added a bowling green and four tennis courts. Dollis Hill House was renovated at an estimated cost of £616 11s 6d, and the ground floor was let to a contractor for the sale of refreshments. The park constable occupied the rear portion of the house. The following year the Surveyor converted the former fruit and vegetable garden attached to the house into an Old English garden, which was to become one of the park's star attractions. Robson probably erected a sundial, provided by Cricklewood & District Improvements Association in 1907, at the centre of the garden. For many years there had been worries about the level crossing over the Dudding Hill Line where the public were exposed to danger from the trains. There was an intention to provide two subways under the railway to improve communications between southern and northern sections of the park but, although the Midland Railway Company raised no objection to the work, it never materialised. However, in October 1912 the Council entered into an agreement with the Midland for the erection of a footbridge to replace the old crossing. Many other works by Robson were completed before he took retirement in 1918. The park today Dollis House as seen from the gardens Gladstone Park is administered by the London Borough of Brent. It has ninety-seven acres of parkland as well as the twenty-seven acres of the William Gladstone open space on its eastern perimeter. Maintained by Brent Parks Service, it is the most heavily used park in Brent and is a current holder of the Green Flag Award, the national standard for parks and green spaces in England and Wales. The award is based on high environmental standards, quality of green space, amenity values and community involvement. Gladstone Park has a formal garden, duck pond, varied terrain, woodland, hedgerows and open ground, all of which change with the seasons. On clear days it offers views from the top of the hill (65 metres above sea level) of London and the surrounding area, including Wembley Stadium, Parliament, the City, the London Eye and the Shard. In 2016 the Council, police and local charities carried out several initiatives to deal with large numbers of people sleeping rough in the park. Most of them were Romanians seeking to work in the UK, some obtaining employment informally in nearby Cricklewood. The park is used by Brent Council as a venue for free sports and health and fitness programs. On the night of 23 August 2014 the park was used for a marriage proposal with hundreds of candles spelling out, \\"Will you marry me?\\" A Metropolitan Police helicopter picked up the message with its thermal imaging camera and shared the image on Twitter as \\"the most romantic guy in North London\\".

The User may download the clip, forward it to friends via E-Mail or post it on a profile of their chosen community or streamed within own websites. History Basic concept The concept for the Clipgenerator was conceived when the founder was looking for an alternative to the expensive and time-consuming creation of a professional video clip in combination with quality-music. Being an entrepreneur unable to find a solution he decided to take the project on himself. Whilst various solutions to create simple slideshows already existed, none combined licensed music with professional effects sequences as well as professional video-and film- synchronization and this was the basis idea for the technology. Product development Approximately one year after work began, a working prototype was produced after which a patent application was granted on August 31, 2006. The founders financed all work on the project until the end of 2007. An incubator investor started to provide funding in 2008 to promote further development for mobile devices in cooperation with the Media High School of Stuttgart as well further deployment of video-technology and a complex music- rights-management system. Development for the second version focused on an improvement in image analysis and recognition software for images as well working towards the standards of Flash, Flex, Ajax, an improved 3D environment, enhancement of templates with parameters, elements, image effects, fading, keying, creation of key-frame animations, and to utilise real time rendering, an entirely automatic audio analysis and potential new GPU rendering options.

Life Green was born at Beverley in Yorkshire in 1706. Having been schooled in his home town, he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge in 1724. Green graduated B.A. in 1728 and was awarded a fellowship in 1730. He was ordained in 1731 and became vicar of Hinxton, Cambridgeshire. He was eventually made domestic chaplain to the Duke of Somerset, who was chancellor of the University of Cambridge. In 1748, the Duke died and was succeeded by the Duke of Newcastle who quickly saw to it that Green was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity, the most senior chair in the university. In 1750, Green was appointed as master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge despite the fact he had no links with the college. In 1756 he became Dean of Lincoln, at which point he resigned the professorship. He was vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge between 1756-1757. Through Newcastle, Green was appointed Bishop of Lincoln in 1761 and he resigned his other ecclesiastical appointments and then in 1764 the Mastership of Corpus. Green campaigned against the Methodists, writing two pamphlets called \\"The Principles and Practices of Methodists Considered\\", but was dissuaded from writing a third by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Secker. He began to lose the approval of the court when he voted in favour of a bill in the House of Lords for the relief of Protestant dissenters. The King, George III is reported to have said “Green, Green, he shall never be translated”. He was never promoted again and died unmarried in Bath on 25 April 1779.

It was invented in 2005 and first introduced in the market in 2007. The product's consistency is similar to that of modeling clay, such as Play-Doh, except it is edible raw and can be baked. Its coloring agents are all vegetable. It is delivered as a powder mix that turns into a kneadable dough when water is added. History Yummy Dough was invented by Stefan Kaczmarek, an IT worker from Idstein, Germany, in fall 2005. Kaczmarek credits his two daughters as having the original idea for the product because they \\"wanted to finally have dough they can play with as well as eat\\". It was first mentioned in a radio broadcast by the Hessischer Rundfunk, which increased the interest significantly. Kaczmarek previously had no intention to market the product but decided otherwise after the reaction to the broadcast. It was premiered as a commercial product at Anuga alimentary exhibition in 2007, where it won the \\"Taste 07\\" award for innovation. This sparked the interest of several large grocery and toy chains; Kaczmarek declined an offer by German food manufacturer Dr. Oetker and instead founded his own company, 123 Nährmittel GmbH, to distribute the product nationwide. Yummy Dough was first sold in supermarkets in 2007, starting with the German grocery chains Hit and REWE. The product is produced by the RUF Lebensmittelwerke in Quakenbrück. In 2009 it became available to North America; it is distributed by Canadian-based toy distributor PlaSmart Inc. This product is featured in season 4 of the Canadian version of Dragons' Den, in which Kaczmarek, and his Canadian partner, Timothy Kimber of PlaSmart Inc., received C$500,000 from investors Kevin O'Leary, W. Brett Wilson, and Jim Treliving, in exchange for a 3.5% cut of revenues, once the investment has been recouped. Further plans also include marketing the product in Asia.

VPAs are a key element of the EU FLEGT Action Plan, which aims to address illegal logging. Under a VPA, the partner country agrees to export only legal timber products to the EU. The EU agrees to give verified legal ('FLEGT-licensed) timber products from the country free access to the EU market. The EU also commits to denying entry to any timber shipments from a VPA partner country that lack FLEGT licences and must therefore be illegal. The aim is to use trade as an incentive, as FLEGT-licensed timber automatically meets the requirements of the EU Timber Regulation, which requires EU operators to use due diligence to prevent illegal wood entering the market. FLEGT licensed timber will not be subject to those checks so will have a green light to enter the EU. The core of each VPA is the description of a timber legality assurance system the partner country will implement in order to verify the legality of timber products and issue verified legal products with FLEGT licences. Each timber legality assurance system must have the following five components: a legality definition, supply chain controls, verification of compliance, FLEGT licensing and independent audit of the whole system.EU FLEGT Facility. 2015. VPA phases., retrieved 16 July 2015 VPAs are also intended to strengthen forest governance in timber-exporting countries by improving transparency, accountability and stakeholder participation. Such gains may result from commitments the partner country makes in the VPA text and annexes, or from the very process of negotiating and implementing a VPA. The FLEGT Regulation, which the EU adopted in 2005 under the FLEGT Action Plan, empowers the European Commission to negotiate VPAs with timber-exporting countries. On 21 April 2016, the Presidents of Indonesia, the European Commission and the European Council confirmed that Indonesia had met the final major requirement of its VPA and was on course to become the world’s first country to issue ‘FLEGT’ licences.European Commission. 2016.

It aired on Fox in the United States on September 27, 2009, and is written by Judah Miller and Murray Miller and directed by Albert Calleros and Josue Cervantes. In the episode, Stan teaches Steve that the only way he can truly appreciate the national anthem is by participating in a war re-enactment, but the experience leaves Steve looking and acting like a traumatized Vietnam War veteran. Meanwhile, Roger gets a pet bird and badgers Stan into giving him a cable code so he can watch a Barbra Streisand pay-per-view special. And an amputee mental patient who has psychic powers, named John Q. Mind, escapes from a mental hospital on a motorcycle. Plot Steve has been chosen to sing the national anthem at the veteran's fair. However, he sings it with little passion, leading Stan to believe that the only way he can truly appreciate the national anthem is by experiencing war. Stan signs them both up for a Vietnam War re- enactment held at a local country club's golf course. Upon enlisting, Steve is immediately put on guard duty but he falls asleep, allowing the Viet Cong to attack their base and capture Stan. In a parody of Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Forrest Gump, Steve goes in on a mission to rescue his father and succeeds. But later, while singing the national anthem at the fair, fireworks are lighted, sending Steve into a \\"war\\" flashback and breaking out a fight between him and other veterans. This causes Steve to be committed to a mental hospital. Later, Steve escapes from the hospital as the doctor questions a limbless man named John Q. Mind on how he opened the curtain. He uses his psychic powers to knock her into the wall as \\"Mind Quad\\" goes to commercial. Steve returns to the country club where the re-enactment took place (in a parody of First Blood). He interrupts the golfing, at which point a patron tries convincing him to leave. When that fails, the patron tries to use force, only for Steve to snap again when he sees a spinning sprinkler, thinking of a helicopter and attacks the patron, then holes up in the golf cart shed. Stan comes in to apologize for pushing him too far and tells him that he can sing the way he wants to. Unfortunately, Steve sings the anthem in an excited and disrespectful mode while wearing a unitard; Stan tells a fellow veteran that Steve is his neighbor's son. Meanwhile, Roger wants to gain the code to the Pay-per-view channel to see Barbra Streisand sing the songs of Celine Dion. However, Stan refuses to give it to him (he agreed when he thought it was $4.99, instead it was $499). So Roger joins the Vietnamese side of the reenactment as Stan's warden, interrogating him while he was captured; he tortures Stan by reading the first draft of the Sex and the City film. When Stan gives him a fake code, Hayley soon gives him the real code, in exchange for setting free an ortolan bunting, a bird he was planning on cooking and eating. However, he gives her Klaus dressed as the bird. As Roger watches his show, he eats the bird (which had been cooked by Francine) and he experiences a DMT trip. As the credits are rolling, the \\"Mind Quad\\" part of the episode returns as a man wearing a black trenchcoat runs into the hospital room. The doctor tells him that John has escaped. The man reveals that John's limbs were not blown off of his body, but into his mind, giving him telekinetic powers. The man vows to catch John as we see John using his psychic powers to ride a motorcycle towards the Pentagon. Reception Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, saying \\"That said, I liked more of the episode than I disliked (particularly the lengthy coda where Steve couldn’t shake his Vietnam War re-enactment experience), so we’ll give it a moderate passing grade. I assume it will improve on a rewatch, actually.\\" Dan Phillips of IGN gave the episode a 7.2 out of 10, saying \\"Considering the strength of the episode's core concept, it's a bit surprising to see the writers push the plot past it as early as they do, abandoning the hilarity of the war reenactment to explore the idea of Steve's \\"Post War Reenactment Traumatic Stress Disorder.\\" What follows is a couple tired veteran jokes and a random paraplegic gag that feels like it's been scraped right off of Family Guy's cutting room floor.\\" The episode was watched by a total of 7.12 million people, this made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to The Cleveland Show, The Simpsons and Family Guy with 10.17 million.

Family and origins Cotys was the son and heir of loyal Roman client rulers Rhoemetalces I and Pythodoris I of Thrace. Cotys’ mother is only known through surviving numismatic evidence, which bears her image and her Royal title of Queen Pythodoris. Cotys’ father Rhoemetalces I was an ally of the first Roman Emperor Augustus. Rhoemetalces I was a direct descendant of the Thracian King Cotys I. Rhoemetalces I was the son of a previous Thracian King, whose name was Cotys and his mother is unknown. Rhoemetalces I was the middle son, who had an elder brother who was called Cotys and his younger brother was Rhescuporis II. Rhoemetalces I's eldest brother Cotys who was Thracian King and an ally to Roman General Pompey, had sent Pompey a force of auxiliaries under his son Rhescuporis I in 48 BC, during the Roman civil war between Pompey and Gaius Julius Caesar. When Rhoemetalces I's brother died, his nephew Rhescuporis I became Thracian King. Rhoemetalces I became the guardian to the young son of his brother, Cotys. Rhescuporis I died in 13 BC when he was defeated and slain in a battle by Vologaeses, chief of the Thracian Bessi, who was a leader in the revolt against the Romans in that year. During this revolt Rhoemetalces I and his family had fled Thrace and only returned when the revolt had ended. Augustus then returned Thrace to him and his family. When Rhescuporis I died, he left no heir so Rhoemetalces I became King of Thrace in 12 BC. Rhoemetalces I ruled Thrace until his death in 12 AD. The Roman historian, Tacitus, describes Rhoemetalces I as ‘attractive and civilized’. King of Thrace When Rhoemetalces I died, Augustus had divided the kingdom into two separate kingdoms: one part for his son Cotys to rule and other half for Rhoemetalces I's remaining brother Rhescuporis II to rule. Tacitus states that Cotys received the cultivated parts, most towns and most Greek cities of Thrace, while Rhescuporis received the wild and savage portion with enemies on its frontier.Tacitus, The Annals 2.64 Not much is known on the early life of Cotys. Cotys had married the Antonia Tryphaena, a Pontian princess who was the daughter of Roman client rulers, Polemon Pythodoros and Pythodorida of Pontus. She was of Anatolian Greek and Roman heritage. Tryphaena's mother was the first grandchild of Roman Triumvir, Mark Antony. However the relationship between Tryphaena and Cotys is unknown. Tacitus describes Cotys as a man of ‘gentle disposition, good natured and mannered’. The Roman poet Ovid, wrote an epistle addressed to him. Ovid praises Cotys for his cultivated taste for literature, and claimed his favour and protection as a brother-poet. Rhescuporis II always wanted to annexed Cotys’ kingdom for himself to rule. However, he was unable to do this out of his fear of Augustus. However, when Augustus died in 14 AD, Rhescuporis II decided to take action. Tacitus describes his character as ‘treacherous’. Rhescuporis II was at first peaceful in seeking to annex his nephew's kingdom, but when Cotys resisted, Rhescuporis II plotted to kill his nephew. Rhescuporis II invited his nephew to a banquet to ratify a treaty between them. Cotys had not expected trouble and was arrested and imprisoned by his uncle. With Cotys imprisoned, Rhescuporis II seized his kingdom. In 18 AD Cotys was murdered by order of Rhescuporis II who falsely represented his death as self-inflicted.Tacitus, The Annals 2.66 Cotys’ wife and children fled Thrace to Cyzicus. In 18 AD Roman Emperor Tiberius opened a murder investigation into Cotys’ death. Tiberius put Rhescuporis II on trial in the Roman Senate and invited Tryphaena to attend the trial. During the trial Tryphaena accused Rhescuporis II of killing her husband. Tiberius found Rhescuporis II guilty and sent him to live in exile in Alexandria, Egypt. On his way to Egypt Rhescuporis II tried to escape and was killed by Roman soldiers. Tiberius returned the whole Thracian Kingdom to Tryphaena and Tiberius appointed Cotys and Tryphaena's first child, Rhoemetalces II, to rule with his mother. The son of Rhescuporis II, Rhoemetalces III was spared by Tiberius and the emperor allowed him to return to Thrace. Marriage and children Cotys had four children by Tryphaena and they were: * A son, Rhoemetalces II, who was named after his paternal grandfather and ruled with Tryphaena from when his father died in 18 until his own death in 38. * A daughter, Gepaepyris, who married the Roman client king Tiberius Julius Aspurgus of the Bosporan Kingdom. * A son, Cotys IX, who became Roman client king of Lesser Armenia from 38 until at least 47. * A daughter, Pythodoris II or Pythodorida II. She was named after her maternal grandparents and her paternal grandmother. In 38, after the death of Rhoemetalces II, Tryphaena abdicated the throne at the request of Roman Emperor Caligula. Pythodoris II married her second paternal cousin Rhoemetalces III and they ruled Thrace as Roman client rulers from 38 until 46.

Early life Behera was born in a Brahmin family in the village of Kashibahal, a former state of Kalahandi. He was educated at Bhawanipatna and graduated in 1935. In 1939 he obtained a degree in physics from Ravenshaw College in Cuttack then went on to graduate with a degree in civil engineering from the Bihar College of Engineering in Patna in 1943. He served an apprenticeship with the Department of Works and Irrigation in the former state of Mysore, Government of Orissa, and in February 1945 was appointed as an assistant engineer in the Jog Hydro power project, where his special assignment concerned irrigation under the Kalindi, Darbar. Bhubaneswar Behera was married to Uma Devi. He has a daughter, Professor Yashodhara Mishra, and three sons: one is a medical doctor, another a police officer Binay Behera, and the third a railway officer. Career Behera came across the perennial Indravati flowing across the Thuamul Rampur Plateau of Kalahandi, a tributary of the Godavari, running parallel to the Eastern Ghats. He visualized the diversion of the river Indravati to the Hati River to create an artificial waterfall from a height of 2,000 feet. This artificial waterfall would generate hydroelectric power that would ensure the perennial supply of water for irrigation. He prepared a preliminary scheme for the same and submitted it to the Maharaja for consideration. The Maharaja was thrilled with his work. Behera was selected by the Government of India as a \\"Post-war reconstruction scholar\\" to pursue higher education abroad. He studied hydraulics and fluid mechanics at the State University of Iowa and wrote his master's thesis on “A Length Criterion of Hydraulic Jump” under the guidance of Professor Poesy. He was trained in model studies and dam construction in Denver, Colo., and project planning under the Tennessee Valley Authority. He joined the Kalahandi State Government as an irrigation engineer in 1947. The princely state of Kalahandi was incorporated into the state of Odisha in 1948. \\"Professor\\" Behera was deputed to work on the Hirakud Dam project, where he worked as the assistant engineer and executive engineer until 1956. Over this period, Behera produced two valuable research papers: “A Mathematical Formula for Design of Earth Slopes” and “Mathematical Formula for Non-Silting and Non-Eroding Velocities in Erodible Channels” for the journal of The Institution of Engineers (India). Both papers were highly appraised. Behera joined the University College of Engineering, Burla, as a professor of civil engineering in 1958. He eventually became the principal of the college in 1961. He later joined the Regional Engineering College in Rourkela in February 1962 as its first principal, and remained thus till 1971. He was appointed the vice-chancellor of Sambalpur University in 1971 and held this position till 1976. In 1977, the Government of India dispatched him to the Democratic Republic of Liberia in West Africa as an adviser for technical education. He held many other roles in the Government of Odisha. He was appointed as a member of the Das Committee by the Government of Odisha to recommend the establishment of colleges in the state. Behera also worked as a member of the Orissa State Planning Board and the Union Public Service Commission until 1981. He officially retired from his work on January 1, 1981, and returned to his native village, Mundraguda, in the Dharmagarh subdivision of Kalahandi District, Orissa. Other endeavors Before Behera became a member of the engineering faculty, he started a monthly Odia magazine called Saptarshi. He wanted to encourage students to read and write in Odia and he wrote editorials for the magazine himself, soon becoming a popular Odia prose writer. His Odia travelogue Paschima Africa re Odis Dhennki is a textbook in many universities of his native state. He has written eight books in Odia; his book of essays, Suna Parikshya, earned him the Odisha Sahitya Academy Award, while his novel Ga on-Ra-Dhaka won him the prestigious Sara la Award. He was also honored with the Nandihosh Award, the Utkal Ratna by Odisha Sahitya Samaj, the Visvesvaraya Award, the Sara la Samman and the title of \\"Sahitya Sudhakar.\\" He was also conferred a doctorate of science (Honor is Causal) from Sambalpur University and Utkal University. Behera's paper titled “Optimum Height of Multipurpose Reservoirs,\\" co-authored with P.K. Mohapatra, and his paper “Flexible Foundation,\\" co-authored with A.P. Mishra, earned the Ministry of Irrigation Gold Medal and The Institution of Engineers (India) Gold Medal, respectively. The Institution of Engineers (India) Odisha State Center honored him with the title of “Senior Engineer” of the state on the occasion of the 50th anniversary celebrations of Indian independence in 1998. Awards These are the list of all the award:- *His essay book Suna Parikshya earned him the Odisha Sahitya Academy Award. * His novel Gaon-ro-Daka earned him the prestigious Sarala Award. * He is a recipient of both the Sarala Sanman and the Prajatantra Prachar Samiti Essay Award. * The Utkal Pathak Sansad, Cuttack, has conferred the title of Sahitya Sudhakar on him. * Sambalpur University and Utkal University have conferred a Doctorate of Science (Honoris Causa) on him. * He won the Utkal Ratna in 1998.

Yebol had focused on developing a list of algorithms of association, clustering and categorization for automatically generating knowledge for question answering, latent semantic analysis web sites, web pages and users. Yebol also integrated human labeled information into its multilayer perceptron and information retrieval algorithms. This technology allows for a multi-dimensional search results format: best-first search and higher – summary of top sites and categories for queries; wider – related search terms; longer – results of expansion terms for the queries; deeper – inside links and keywords of search result pages.

The airport is used for general aviation, with no commercial airline service. World War II During World War II, Ghisonaccia Airfield was a military airfield used by the United States Army Air Forces. It was an all- weather temporary field built in late 1943 by the XII Engineer Command using Marsden Matting for runways and parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. It was turned over to the Twelfth Air Force for operational combat use. Known units assigned to the airfield were: * HQ 57th Bombardment Wing, 20 April-5 October 1944 * 310th Bombardment Group, 10 December 1943 – 7 April 1945, B-25 Mitchell * 414th Night Fighter Squadron, (Twelfth Air Force), 9 January-4 February 1944; 20 March–July 1944, Bristol Beaufighter * 417th Night Fighter Squadron, (Twelfth Air Force), 7 January–February 1944, (Ground echelon only) After the war ended, the airfield was turned over to local authorities.

Application for an incidental take permit is subject to certain requirements, including preparation by the permit applicant of a conservation plan.US Fish and Wildlife Service definition. \\"Take\\" is defined by the ESA as harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect any threatened or endangered species. Harm may include significant habitat modification where it actually kills or injures a listed species through impairment of essential behavior (e.g., nesting or reproduction).US Fish and Wildlife Service factsheet. In the 1982 ESA amendments, Congress authorized the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (through the Secretary of the Interior) to issue permits for the \\"incidental take\\" of endangered and threatened wildlife species (Section 10a(1)B of the ESA). Thus, permit holders can proceed with an activity, such as construction or other economic development, that may result in the \\"incidental\\" taking of a listed species.

In the 1950s, the school had around 450 boys, and had the same by the 1970s, with 100 in the sixth form. The girls' grammar school was called the Lilley & Stone Girls' High School, which was on London Road. The current Grove School was a secondary modern school. Comprehensive In 1977, a voluntary controlled comprehensive school, opened on the grounds of the Magnus Boys' Grammar School also known as the Thomas Magnus School on Earp Avenue. It was a co-educational 8-form entry school for ages 14–18, with 600 boys and girls, and 130 in the sixth form. It was originally planned to go comprehensive in 1976, and was planned to be known as the Magnus Upper School. The headmaster was Mr Potter. The Lilley and Stone School eventually the Newark High School, having become a co-educational comprehensive for ages 14–18. Newark High School closed in 2008 and the site is now used as a sixth form campus for The Newark Academy. By the 1980s it was known as the Thomas Magnus (Controlled) Upper School. Mr Potter retired in 1980. Also in Newark was the Magdalene High School, a lower school (ages 11–14), on Barnby Road. The Grove School was twice the size of the Magnus School. The Magdalene High School combined with the Thomas Magnus School in 1997 to form the current school, but essentially the Magdalene High School was closed. The school went into special measures in May 2008. Academy The school converted to academy status on 1 February 2014 and was renamed Magnus Church of England Academy. The school is now sponsored by the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham, but continues to coordinate with Nottinghamshire County Council for admissions. Academic performance It gets very low GCSE results, barely over the government minimum for comprehensive schools, but its A-level results are much better than national average. Both schools in Newark get quite low GCSE results. The Grove School gets lower A-level results.

It is a military airport located northwest of the city of Cagliari, Sardinia, in a vast area between the towns of Decimomannu, Decimoputzu, San Sperate and Villasor. The airport is named after Colonel pilot Giovanni Farina, Gold Medal for bravery, died in combat in the skies of Sardinia 14 June 1942. The airfield is a front-line NATO training facility primarily used since 1979 for Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) of various NATO air force fighter aircraft. Decimonannu was also the Home Base for the Taktisches Ausbildungskommando der Luftwaffe Italien and the Base was used for Training flights. History Decimomannu became in effect a military airport on 3 June 1940 with the transfer of the Italian 32º Wing from Cagliari Elmas. During World War II the airport served both Axis powers and Allied forces. Between 1941 and 1943 the airport hosted the 36th Wing, with Savoia- Marchetti SM79 bombers and Savoia-Marchetti SM84. On 27 September 1941 the airport forces were involved in a bloody battle between the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force in the central Mediterranean. On 17 February 1943, the airport was bombed by the Anglo-American allies.

In April 1957 a \\"Air Weapons Training Installation\\" (AWTI) unit was established by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). In December 1959 an agreement was signed between Italy, Canada and West Germany, which regulated the use of the air base and firing ranges associated with it. Over the years the base saw a growing increase in flights. Decimomannu during 1970 and 2000 was consecrated as the airport with the highest number of takeoffs and landings in Europe, with an average of about 60000 movements per year, equal to about 450 daily movements. Currently, the main users of the airport is the Italian Air Force. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) left the airport in December 2016 because of the restrictions about flying and rising costs.

Marie, Ontario, Canada. Its primary performance venues include the Kiwanis Community Theatre Centre and Central United Church in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral and the Soo Theatre in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. An average concert season consists of 4 to 6 concerts, plus a year-end fundraising event called Beer, Bratwurst and Beethoven. The Music Director and Conductor of the Sault Symphony is John Wilkinson.  History  The Sault Symphony Orchestra first was formed in 1956 as the Sault Symphonette by Don Buchan, Ed Shrubsole, and Ed and Katherine Gartshore, among others. With support from Algoma Steel, the Symphonette gave live concerts and radio broadcasts. Don Buchan, and later James Whicher, conducted. In 1969, the group was renamed the Sault Symphony, and was directed by Lajos Bornyi. Within four years, the group had a Board of directors|Board of Directors and had joined the Ontario Federation of Symphony Orchestras as the 25th symphony orchestra of the province. In the mid-1970s, several important steps were taken by the growing Orchestra and the group emerged stronger than ever. It was renamed the Sault Ste. Marie International Association, to reflect the increasing presence of players from both sides of the border. At a later date the official name of the organization was changed to Sault Symphony Association. A partnership with the Sudbury Symphony developed. There were several joint concerts and the semi-regular participation of musicians from one orchestra to the other. Dr. John Wilkinson was appointed Music Director and Conductor in December, 1977, and still serves in this capacity today. During the 1980s, the Sault Symphony sponsored a string quartet thanks to generous support from the Ontario Arts Council and Algoma Steel Corporation. In 1989, the Sault Symphony Association and the Conservatory at Algoma University established a CORE musicians program, with funding from the Ontario Arts Council. Two of these CORE musicians continue to work for the Sault Symphony today: Anya Mallinger (concertmaster) and Bernadette Merritt (principal cellist); they hold sectionals and do outreach at various schools, as well as play in the Orchestra. Anya Mallinger has served as concertmaster of the Sault Symphony since 1995. The Sault Symphony Orchestra continues to work at providing varied and exciting programs, often with internationally recognized soloists. Its continued existence is a tribute to the hard work of Board members, volunteers, musicians, and the support of its audiences.  Governance  The Board of Directors of the Sault Symphony Association governs the Sault Symphony Orchestra. The President is Angela Rasaiah, Al Beamish serves as Vice-President. Heather Myers is Treasurer, and the Secretary is Gudrun Schatzler.  Sault Symphony School of Music   History  The Sault Symphony School of Music was established by the Symphony in 1997, when a joint venture with Lake Superior State University allowed the Symphony to relocate world-renowned violinist, Oleg Pokhanovski, and his brother, Mikhail, an accomplished violist, to Sault Ste. Marie. The faculty of the School expanded over the years and eventually included nine instructors. Services were offered to children of all ages in guitar, violin, viola, cello, piano, voice, woodwinds, brass instruments, theory, harmony, and history. Many partnerships were forged through the School of Music allowing the Symphony to take innovative approaches to the music education of the youth in this community.  Programs of the Sault Symphony School of Music  # Children With Special Needs # Young Artists' Concerto Competition # Stepping Stones # Magic, Mirth, and Music 1\\\\. The School of Music provided a music program for children with special needs. In its years of operation, this program consisted of twelve students, who were able to choose violin, cello, guitar, viola, piano, or voice. The fees were donated by the Symphony with support from outside groups. A student recital was held every year to showcase the talents of such special artists. 2\\\\. For the last ten years, the Sault Symphony has sponsored a Young Artists’ Concerto Competition, which is open to all orchestral instrumentalists, piano, and voice students, up to 20 years of age. One local and two out-of-town adjudicators judge the performances. Contestants must be living or studying in the Algoma District or Michigan’s Tri-County area of Michigan's upper peninsula.. First prize includes the opportunity to perform with the Sault Symphony Orchestra in one of its regular season concerts, as well as scholarships for the other place-winners. 3\\\\. Stepping Stones was created to provide musical instruction to pre-school children between the ages of 1 and 5. Stepping Stones was designed specifically to appeal to young children and teach them about musical instruments and theory, using a variety of interactive lessons, videos, and actual musical instruments that are safe for children to handle. With a maximum of 8 children per session, Stepping Stones offered personalized instruction. 4\\\\. The Youth Education and Outreach Program of the Sault Symphony School of Music introduced this program in the 2007-2008 school year. Through the program, visits by music teachers and orchestra members are made to the local elementary schools to present interactive sessions of music instruction. These sessions involve live performance, the handling of musical instruments, audio-visual presentations, art projects, evaluation tools, and occasional guest musicians. Ontario Curriculum-based follow-up lesson suggestions and materials are provided to the classroom teachers. The Symphony School of Music ceased operation in 2012 when the Symphony offices were moved to smaller quarters. The Youth Education and Outreach Program continues to function and the Young Artist Concerto Competition is held every other year.

Born in England, he represented Barbados at international level. Club career Hurdle began his career with Fulham, but never made an appearance for the team. After a year spent in non-league football with Dorchester Town, Hurdle signed for Brentford in 1994, making 90 appearances over the next four seasons. After leaving Brentford in 1998, Hurdle signed for Plymouth Argyle, but never made a league appearance for the team and left after just a month, moving to non-league side Bognor Regis Town. Hurdle later played non-league football for Basingstoke Town. While at Basingstoke, Hurdle spent a loan spell at Crawley Town. Hurdle also appeared for a number of other non-league sides, including Whyteleafe, Carshalton Athletic, St Albans City, Dulwich Hamlet, Yeading, Molesey, Egham Town and Walton & Hersham. International career Hurdle represented Barbados at international level. In March 2000, he turned down a chance to play internationally to help Crawley Town in their Southern Football League Premier Division relegation battle, stating he would prefer to play against Dorchester Town saying it was the \\"bigger game\\". He said: \\"Crawley's need is far greater than that of Barbados. They'll be able to get a result without me, but it's big match for Crawley and a game we can't afford to lose\\". He has also represented a Caribbean All Stars team in an exhibition game against Jamaica at the Giants Stadium, New Jersey in March 1999.  Personal life  After leaving Fulham and prior to returning to professional football in 1994, Hurdle worked as a bus driver. As of May 2011, he was working as a production manager in television.

The right side houses the Skolfield-Whittier House, a Society museum.The Pejepscot Historical Society, located in Brunswick, is one of the oldest historical societies in the state of Maine. Founded in 1888, the Society's mission is to preserve and celebrate the history of the Pejepscot region, which includes the towns of Brunswick, Harpswell and Topsham. History of the society Beginnings The Society was founded by 16 local citizens who officially met for the first time on January 10, 1888 at the Brunswick Selectmen's Room in the Odd Fellows building.\\"Pejepscot Historical Society Was Church in 1841\\", Coastal Journal, July 1, 1970, page 3. At the time, the town of Brunswick was recognized as the largest and wealthiest in the state and was nearing its 150th anniversary. Brunswick's rapid industrialization \\"inspired many to look back at the lifestyles, traditions, and history of the area soon to be lost.\\"Hudson, Katherine B. \\"Of Leaders and Loyalty: The Pejepscot Historical Society, 1888–1987\\". Maine Historical Society Quarterly, vol. 26, no.4 (Spring 1987), page 237. At this first meeting the group adopted a set of by-laws, elected officers, approved a regular meeting schedule and established membership dues at $1. The group's first order of business was to plan Brunswick's 150th anniversary celebration, scheduled for June 13, 1889.\\"General Background Information\\", Pejepscot Historical Society Research File, 1989. Originally referred to as \\"Local Historical Society\\", by the time of its legal incorporation in December 1891 the group had chosen the name \\"Pejepscot Historical Society\\" to reflect the history of not just the town of Brunswick but of the region.Hudson, pp. 236–250. By 1889 the young Society had already amassed a collection of approximately 500 artifacts and it was quickly becoming clear that a designated Society building was needed. In 1891 charter member John Furbish purchased the 1827 First Congregational Church building on School Street (later known as the Varney Lecture Hall) in Brunswick for the Society's use at the price of $1,000. The organization then worked to raise the $1000 (as well as an additional $500 for repairs) needed to buy the building from Furbish. By the end of 1892 the Pejepscot Historical Society had its first home and on May 3, 1893 the first artifacts were moved into the School Street building.\\"Facts About the Pejepscot Historical Society Building\\", Pejepscot Historical Society Research File John Furbish in his 1863 wedding photo.

Following this lengthy period of inactivity, in May 1923 a meeting was held to reorganize the historical society. The success of a lecture series which brought prominent speakers to the town helped revitalize the Society and in 1939 the group played a prominent role in Brunswick's bicentennial celebration. Issues with the Varney Lecture Hall pushed the organization to search for a new, larger, heated space beginning in 1955. In 1974 the Society purchased a large Italiante brick building at 11 Lincoln Street known as the McManus-Richardson House and began moving their collection (now numbering over 1,500 artifacts) into the building. Establishment of museums In March, 1982 Dr. Alice Skolfield Whittier offered her half of a Park Row duplex and its contents to the organization as what was called by then-president F. Burton Whitman \\"the biggest and best gift ever made to our Society.\\"Hudson, page 246. The building, now known as the Skolfield-Whittier House, serves as a veritable time capsule of Victorian life. Not long after this, the owners of the building adjoining the Skolfield-Whittier House sold their property to the Society so that the organization might be headquartered near its first separate museum. To help fund this purchase, the Society sold their building at 11 Lincoln Street and relocated to the Park Row duplex. Later that same year the former home of Civil War hero Joshua L. Chamberlain, on the corner of Maine and Potter Streets, was auctioned off following the death of its owner. At the request of local citizens, the Society purchased the building and began extensive restoration work. In July 1984 the house was opened to the public as the Joshua L. Chamberlain Museum. Today, the Pejepscot Historical Society operates tours of the Chamberlain Museum and Skolfield-Whittier House while featuring rotating exhibits of local history at its 159 Park Row headquarters.

Reverse engineering  Screenshot of cylinder head registration in Simpleware ScanIP With ScanIP, it is possible to reverse engineer legacy parts and other geometries that cannot be accurately created in CAD. Scans of objects can be visualised and processed in ScanIP to learn more about their original design, and exported as FE and CFD models for simulation of physical properties. The software has applications in aerospace, automotive and other fields needing to generate accurate 3D models from scans.Wang, W., & Genc, K., 2012.

Files created using ScanIP feature guaranteed watertight triangulations and correct norms, as well as options for volume and topology preserving smoothing. STL files are generated with conforming interfaces, enabling multi-material printing. Internal structures, otherwise known as lattices, can also be added to 3D models of parts in order to reduce weight prior to additive manufacturing.Young, P., Raymont, D., Hao, L, Cotton, R., 2010.

Lattice techniques have also been used for developing new parts in aerospace, automotive and other industries.  Add-on modules  Simpleware FE Module The FE module generates volume meshes with conforming multi-parts for FEA and CFD. Finite element contacts, node sets and shell elements can be defined, as can boundary conditions for computational fluid dynamics. Material properties can be assigned based on greyscale values or pre-set values. Users can decide between a grid-based or a free meshing approach. Meshes can be exported directly into leading Computer-aided engineering solvers without the need for further processing. The result can be exported to ABAQUS (\`.inp\` files), ANSYS (\`.ans\` files), COMSOL Multiphysics (\`.mphtxt\` files), I-DEAS (\`.unv\` files), LS-DYNA (\`.dyn\` files), MSC (\`.out\` files), FLUENT (\`.msh\` files) Simpleware AS Ortho Module The Simpleware AS Ortho (Auto Segmentation for Orthopedics) module uses Artificial Intelligence-based Machine Learning for automated segmentation of hips and knees. The module enables users to segment bones and/or cartilage, including common landmarks. Hip segmentation from CT scans includes: proximal femurs, pelvis, and sacrum, with hip landmarks placed on the pelvis, coccyx, and femurs. For knee segmentation from PD weighted MRI scans, regions of interest include: femur, tibia, and associated cartilage, patella, and fibula, with knee landmarks placed on the femur and tibia. Simpleware AS Cardio Module AS Cardio provides an easy-to-use tool to automatically segment cardiovascular data. In this specific release, we focus on heart segmentation from CT including blood pool cavities, selected muscle tissue as well as common key landmarks. Simpleware Custom Modeler This module is an automated solution for users, which is developed with Simpleware engineers to tailor the software to their current processes. The module enables custom automated segmentation to be set up, as well as options for fully automated: image processing, landmarking, measurements, statistics and reports, workflows for meshing models and export to 3D printing, CAD, and simulation, among other features. Simpleware CAD Module The CAD module allows for the import and interactive positioning of CAD models within image data. The resulting combined models can then be exported as multi-part STLs or, using the FE module, converted automatically into multi-part finite element or CFD meshes. Internal structures can also be added to data to reduce weight whilst maintaining mechanical strength. With CAD, users can avoid having to work with image-based files in CAD-based software. Data can be acquired from ScanIP, IGES (\`.iges\` and \`.igs\` files), STEP (\`.step\` and \`.stp\` files), STL (\`.stl\` files). The result can be saved in ScanIP files for further processing or exported to STL (\`.stl\` files). Simpleware NURBS Module The NURBS module allows segmented 3D image data to be fitted with non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) using automated patch fitting techniques for export as IGES (\`.iges\` and \`.igs\` files). Autosurface algorithms provide a straightforward route from image data to CAD-ready NURBS models, with options available for contour and curvature detection. CAD geometries can also be inspected prior to export to remove spurious features. Simpleware Design Link This module allows users of Simpleware software and SolidWorks to harness the power of both software packages and speed up product development workflows. Simpleware SOLID Module The SOLID module calculates the effective stiffness tensor and individual elastic moduli of material samples. Perform numerical homogenisation with a built-in FE solver or derive quick semi- analytical estimates from segmented images. Simpleware FLOW Module The FLOW module calculates the absolute permeability tensor of porous material samples. Numerical homogenisation is performed using a built-in Stokes solver. Simpleware LAPLACE Module The LAPLACE module calculates the effective electrical, thermal and molecular properties of materials whose behaviour is governed by the Laplace's equation. Perform numerical homogenisation with a built-in FE solver or derive quick semi-analytical estimates from segmented images.

The film stars Anuj Saxena, Udita Goswami, Sameer Kochhar and Tareena Patel in the lead roles, while Gulshan Grover makes a special appearance. The film was released on 30 April 2010. The musical score is by Udbhav Ojha and Vijay Verma and the lyrics are by Jalees Sherwani, Manthan and Prashant Vasl. The title song is sung by Sajid Khan in his funky style whereas the other songs are sung by Shaan, Shreya Ghoshal and Vasundhara Das. The background musical score is by Amar Mohile.

DIG Ranveer Tyagi (Rajesh Khattar) has vested interest in getting to the bottom of a murder of the State Industries Minister Vishwajeet Rana in which Sohail is involved and has access to vital information. Inspector Siddharth (Sameer Kochhar) is the right hand of the DIG who is monitoring Sohail's actions. Sohail is chased by Siddharth and the policemen and in the process, Sohail gets badly injured and nabbed. Due to his condition, under the advice of Dr AK Sehgal, (Denzil Smith) Sohail is sent under police protection to the Neurological Research Institute, Panchgani for observation and rehab. In this scenario enters Nupur Chauhan (Udita Goswami) as the nurse to attend to Sohail. She finds out that Sohail is not in a vegetative state but only acting it out. She helps him in escaping from the police. The other players of this Chase are Surabhee (Tareena Patel), who is a TV journalist and also Sohail's love interest and industrialist Anil Khanna (Aditya Raj Kapoor), who is interested to get his Rs 1000 crore Power Plant project approved by the Govt. Added to this there is Anthony D'Costa (Gulshan Grover), who is also in search for the truth. The hunt for Sohail and search for truth takes us through the streets of Mumbai in an exciting and thrilling Chase. The truth has the potential of blowing up the entire political system apart. The line between truth and lies gets blurred. Who is the victim and who is the criminal? What you see may not be the real truth. Do the criminals get caught? Does the victim get justice ? Who are Sohail Ansari and Nupur and what is the role of Anthony D'Costa? This Chase for the truth ends in a nail- biting, tense and unusual climax which will leave you spell bound. It is said that you are innocent till proven guilty, but what happens when the law is interested in punishing the accused without verifying his innocence or guilt? What happens when the law upholders are ruthless and have no scruples?

The original shrine was at the summit of the Komagatake peak of Mount Hakone. The shrine was relocated to the shores of Lake Ashi; its current form dates to 1667.Giesen, Walter. (2012). Japan, p. 259. Credit for establishment is also given to Priest Mangan, for pacifying the nine-headed dragon that lived at the bottom of Lake Ashi. According to the Azuma Kagami, Minamoto no Yoritomo sought guidance and shelter from the kami at Hakone after his defeat in Battle of Ishibashiyama during the Genpei War. Upon becoming shōgun, Yoritomo became a patron of the shrine. In the Kamakura period, the shrine was popular with samurai. This support continued through the Sengoku period. The shrine was burned down by the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Battle of Odawara. It was reconstructed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and given a grant of 200 koku of revenue. The Tokugawa shogunate continued to support the shrine.

The director of the film was Hans Canosa, who had been active in American films. The script was written by Gabrielle Zevin, the author of the novel Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac, on which the film was based on. When the film was announced, it was given the working title of Lost Memories. Filming began on 26 November 2008 and ended in early January 2009. The film was originally planned to be shot and produced in the United States. However, the director decided that it would be better to make the film in Japan where the cultural aspects of the setting would enrich the story. Therefore, he took the project to the Japanese film companies after which production began. The high school setting in the original story was changed to an international school for the film, and apart from the staff and cast, everything concerned with filming the film used Japanese methods. This meant that the film contained approximately a quarter of the English conversation as was in the original story.  Release  The release date for the film was not disclosed for a long time following the announcement that it was to be produced. However, it was officially announced on 11 October 2009 that the film would open in March 2010. At the same time as the announcement, the title of the film was changed from Lost Memories to Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac. When it opened at 247 cinemas screens throughout Japan, it was listed as 10th on the Japanese box office rankings (according to Kogyo Tsushinsha) for the first two days between 27 and 28 March 2010 and made 48,909,800 yen with 8,598 people attending the film.

It was first broadcast on the 15 and 16 of October 2009. It features the Judoon, the intergalactic police introduced in the 2007 Doctor Who episode \\"Smith and Jones\\". The episode involves a Judoon Captain, Captain Tybo, chasing down an escaped prisoner known as \\"the destroyer of worlds\\", with their chase leading them to Earth. Alien investigator Sarah Jane Smith and her companions become involved after Captain Tybo issues a distress call while crash landing, which is picked up by Sarah Jane's supercomputer, Mr Smith. Plot Part 1 Sarah Jane continues to live her life on Bannerman Road. Investigating a nanotechnology company, she is thrown out and goes back to her house, when suddenly, an alien space pod crashes into a building. Sarah Jane's supercomputer, Mr Smith, picks up on a distress call from the ship's occupant, a remember of the \\"intergalactic police\\" race, the Judoon. Sarah Jane and her companions take a trip to the building, where Judoon Captain Tybo is shooting at an alien escaped prisoner, Androvax, a Veil, who soon possesses a little girl. Luke and Rani team up with the Judoon Captain, while Sarah Jane and Clyde meet the little girl. Sarah Jane becomes possessed by Androvax and Clyde is put out of focus. Luke, Rani and Captain Tybo locate him and he is awakened. Meanwhile, Rani's parents, Gita and Haresh, pay a visit to the nanotech company to help improve Gita's flower business but they are arrested. Captain Tybo, Clyde, Luke and Rani arrive at Bannerman Road to discover that the possessed Sarah Jane has ordered Mr Smith to self-destruct with a one-minute countdown. Part 2 Luke talks Mr Smith out of self-destructing; the team heads over to the nanotechnology laboratory to save Sarah Jane and for Captain Tybo to bring in Androvax who must be executed for the destruction of 12 planets. The evil Sarah Jane has released the nanoforms, to build a spacecraft for Androvax, threatening to destroy the Earth in the process. Gita and Haresh are arrested by the guards. They easily escape and are then confronted, scanned and catalogued by newly arrived Judoon troopers. Evil Sarah Jane explains that the spaceship design is based on the crashed Roswell spaceship, and then reveals that he wants to destroy everything, since he was upset when his planet's sun burnt out and wants to destroy all inhabited worlds believing that destruction is the way of the universe. Clyde and Rani use a ruse to lock Captain Tybo in a lab room and use fire extinguishers to freeze the nanobots which were eating through a door. The troopers free Captain Tybo and then everybody converge in the now completed spaceship control room where Androvax is arrested by the Judoon platoon. Luke uses the ship's controls to deactivate the nanobots. The Judoon charge Clyde and Rani with interference, but take the pair's assistance and motives as mitigating factors, limiting their punishment to a bar to extraterrestrial travel.

Directed by Greg Colton and written by Wellesley Wild, the episode originally aired on Fox in the United States on September 27, 2009, along with the series premiere of The Cleveland Show. In \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", two of the show's main characters, baby genius Stewie and anthropomorphic dog Brian, both voiced by series creator Seth MacFarlane, use an \\"out-of-this-world\\" remote control to travel through a series of various parallel universes. They eventually end up in a world where dogs rule and humans obey. Brian becomes reluctant to return to his own universe, and he ultimately ends up breaking the remote, much to the dismay of Stewie, who soon seeks a replacement. The \\"Road to\\" episodes which have aired throughout various seasons of Family Guy were inspired by the Road to ... comedy films starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour, though this episode was not originally conceived as a \\"Road to\\" show. During the sixth season, episodes of Family Guy were delayed from regular broadcast due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike. MacFarlane, the series creator and executive producer, sided with the Writers Guild and participated in the strike until its conclusion. As a result, the seventh season consisted entirely of hold-overs. \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" was the first episode to be produced and aired after the strike ended. It was first announced at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International. Responses to the episode were highly positive; critics praised its storyline, numerous cultural references, and use of various animation styles. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 10.17 million people during its original airing in the United States. The episode featured guest performances by Kei Ogawa, Kotaro Watanabe and Jamison Yang, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Greg Colton won a Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Achievement in Animation, for storyboarding the episode, at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards. \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" was released on DVD along with seven other episodes from the season on June 15, 2010. Plot As the Griffin family attend the county fair, Stewie announces that he has bred a winning pedigree pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to Brian that he got the pig from a farm in a parallel universe, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog in the same time and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed, so the Dark Ages never occurred and thus humanity is 1000 years more technologically advanced (despite the existence of the Sistine Chapel in that universe, albeit done by John Hinckley Jr. instead of Michelangelo). This leads a fascinated Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the Griffin family. As time passes, Brian loses interest in the adventure and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no idea how to return home. Continuing their efforts, they reach a universe where humans are subservient to dogs. Stewie finally figures out how to modify the remote device so that they can return home; but Brian, overwhelmed by the thought of a world run by dogs like himself, is reluctant to leave and takes the remote. Stewie and Brian fight over the device, ultimately breaking it, which traps them in the alternative universe. In desperation, the two go to the universe's version of the Griffin family – who are all dogs except for their pet Brian, who is human – hoping to find a way home. The dog version of Stewie quickly confronts the two, revealing that he has also developed a universe-traveling device that would allow them to return to their own universe. Before Dog Stewie can fetch them his remote control, Human Stewie bites the dog version of his father, Peter, out of anger for being treated like an animal and is sent to the pound where he is to be euthanized later that day. The two Brians and Dog Stewie go to the human pound to free him, and both Stewie and Brian are sent back to their original universe. As they are being transported, human Brian, dreaming of a better life in a world of intelligent humans, leaps into the inter-universe portal at the last moment and successfully makes it to the original universe with the other two. Excited about his new prospects in life, human Brian begins his travels in a brand new universe but is abruptly struck by a car. Production and development Seth MacFarlane agreed to let the episode become a \\"Road to\\" episode, after being approached by Colton. The episode was first announced at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, on July 26, 2008. It was written by series regular Wellesley Wild and directed by Greg Colton shortly after the conclusion of the seventh production season, which consisted entirely of held-over episodes due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" is the fifth episode of the \\"Road to\\" hallmarks of the series, which have aired in various seasons of the show, and the second to be directed by Colton. The episodes are a parody of the seven Road to... comedy films starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour. Though it was not originally intended to be a \\"Road to\\" episode, Greg Colton convinced series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane and \\"Spies Reminiscent of Us\\" director Cyndi Tang to change the episode's title from \\"Sliders\\", parodying the science fiction television series Sliders. Colton's suggestion of the new title \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" was accepted, as was altering the premise of \\"Spies Reminiscent of Us\\", the season's original \\"Road to\\" episode. Executive producer and former Star Trek: Enterprise writer David A. Goodman, a fan of science fiction and the series Sliders, played a key role in the episode's original development. The production staff of Family Guy, including Wellesley Wild, watched an episode of Sliders before writing the show. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors, with Andrew Goldberg and Alex Carter working as staff writers for the episode. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \\"Road to the Multiverse\\". Ron Jones and MacFarlane also contributed to the music and lyrics featured in the episode. The episode features several examples of animation styles that differ greatly from the series' customary appearance. One such example involves the Disney universe, where the characters are drawn in the style of classic Walt Disney animated films. The sequence was animated entirely in Los Angeles by Main Street Productions, which were approached and recruited by series producer Kara Vallow to create the sequence, rather than in South Korea where the show is normally animated. MacFarlane described the scene as \\"a bit of challenge\\" and \\"kind of an experiment\\" since every character had to be completely redesigned based on the style of such films as \\"Pinocchio, Beauty and the Beast and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\\" Another difference occurs in the dog universe, where the human characters are redrawn as dogs and Brian is redrawn as a human. MacFarlane found redesigning Brian easiest, simply giving him \\"a big nose and a collar.\\" In addition to traditional animation, the episode included a parody by Sarah E. Meyer, Eileen Kohlhepp, Kelly Mazurowskiof of Robot Chicken, a stop motion series created by Family Guy cast member Seth Green for the Cartoon Network animation block Adult Swim. Green did not take part in the making of the parody; it was instead animated by the Los Angeles company Screen Novelties, which had worked on the early seasons of Robot Chicken. \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", along with the seven other episodes from Family Guys eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on June 15, 2010. The DVDs included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane, various crew and cast members from several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes, a special mini-feature that discussed the process behind animating \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" and a mini-feature entitled Family Guy Karaoke. The set also includes a reprint of the script for the episode. In addition to the regular cast, Japanese actors Kei Ogawa, Kotaro Watanabe and Jamison Yang guest starred in the episode as Japanese-inspired versions of the Griffin family and Glenn Quagmire. Recurring guest voice actor John G. Brennan reprised his recurring role as Mort Goldman and Adam West reprised his role as Mayor Adam West, who appears as an anthropomorphic mouse in the Disney universe. Minor appearances were made by writer and showrunner Steve Callaghan, actor Ralph Garman, writer and showrunner Mark Hentemann and writers Patrick Meighan, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin and John Viener. Cultural references The episode opens with Stewie revealing his ability to travel across parallel universes to Brian. The first universe that they decide to visit, after having questioned the origin of Stewie's pedigree pig, is said to exist in a world where Christianity is absent. In this universe, everything is seemingly years in advance of the 21st century; Quagmire is able to take a single pill and be instantly cured of the AIDS virus, and flying cars and buildings surround them. As the two travel through the universe, they come upon Stewie's older sister Meg, who has become significantly more attractive. While they watch her walk down the street, the 1984 single \\"Drop Dead Legs\\" by Van Halen plays. Playing on the nonexistence of Christianity, Brian and Stewie visit the Sistine Chapel and discover that a large collection of photos of American actress Jodie Foster has been substituted for The Creation of Adam painting by Michelangelo, who was fired and replaced by John Hinckley Jr. Walt Disney's works were prominently referenced in the Family Guy universe Seeking to explore more alternative realities, Stewie takes Brian to a universe resembling the 1960 animated sitcom The Flintstones. Peter and his wife Lois are shown dressed in a manner similar to Fred Flintstone and Wilma Flintstone respectively. Becoming tired of this universe, the two then transport themselves to a universe where the atomic bombing of Japan never occurred, allowing Japan to conquer the United States in World War II. Another universe references many works by Walt Disney. Meg appears as Ursula from the 1989 film The Little Mermaid and Herbert appears as the Queen from the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The rumor about Walt Disney being an anti-Semite is also referenced by having the universe's occupants attack the Disney version of Mort Goldman when he enters a room, brutally beating him to death off-screen. Discouraged, Brian and Stewie transport themselves to a universe resembling the Adult Swim series Robot Chicken, a show co-created by Family Guy cast member Seth Green. The sequence reveals several action figures of cartoon characters: He-Man, Optimus Prime, Lion-O and Duke from G.I. Joe. Continuing their travels, the two come across a universe where singer and performer Frank Sinatra was never born, resulting in the loss of the 1960 presidential election by President John F. Kennedy to then-Vice President Richard Nixon, which causes World War III. Brian questions whether Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy, and Stewie responds that he shot Mayor McCheese instead. A sequence similar to the Zapruder film, which shows the assassination of Kennedy, is shown, with Jacqueline Kennedy also appearing. Brian and Stewie next discover a universe completely depicted as a political cartoon. The next reference occurs in the dog universe when Stewie says, \\"Take your stinking paws off me you damn, dirty dog!\\" which is a reference to the famous quote \\"Take your stinking paws off me you damn, dirty ape!\\" from the first Planet of the Apes movie. The final reference of the episode also occurs in the dog universe when Stewie mentions, \\"Gosh, Brian, I sure hope this next leap, will be the leap home,\\" a nod to the opening narration of the time travel series Quantum Leap. Reception \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" was broadcast on September 27, 2009, as a part of the Animation Domination block on Fox, and was preceded by an episode of The Simpsons and the pilot episode of MacFarlane's new show The Cleveland Show. It was followed by the season premiere of MacFarlane's other show American Dad!. It was watched by 10.17 million viewers in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings, despite being aired simultaneously with the season premiere of Desperate Housewives on ABC, the season premiere of The Amazing Race on CBS and Sunday Night Football on NBC. The episode also acquired a 5.2 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating The Simpsons, The Cleveland Show and American Dad!, in addition to edging out all three shows in total viewership. The episode's ratings were Family Guys highest since the airing of the season six episode \\"McStroke\\". The episode's first broadcast in Canada, on Global TV, was watched by 1.29 million viewers, making it first for its timeslot in the week it was broadcast. \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" received critical acclaim, with one calling the storyline \\"right up there with the best of the early episodes we've seen on the series.\\" In a simultaneous review of the episodes of The Simpsons and American Dad! that preceded and followed the episode respectively and The Cleveland Show pilot, The A.V. Clubs Emily VanDerWerff commented that she felt \\"essentially predisposed to like\\" the episode, adding that she enjoyed the entire theme of the show, in addition the fact that it was more than just science fiction. In the conclusion of her review VanDerWerff called the episode a \\"solid start to the eighth season\\" and rated it as a B+, the best rating between The Simpsons episode \\"Homer the Whopper\\", the American Dad! episode \\"In Country...Club\\" and The Cleveland Shows series premiere. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode a 9.6 out of 10, saying that the episode featured \\"plenty of memorable lines, some truly stunning animation ... and a relentless non-stop barrage of witty jokes.\\" In a subsequent review in January 2010 of \\"Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures\\", Haque called the episode \\"creative, visually impressive, and features some of the best random gags we've seen on the show in a long time.\\" In 2019, to celebrate the show's 20th anniversary, IGN published a list of the 20 best Family Guy episodes, with \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" ranked the fourth best. Television critic Alex Rocha of TV Guide also found the episode to have \\"great laughs,\\" saying that the show is \\"definitely off to a great start\\" to a new season. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number one on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of \\"yukyukyuks\\" and described the episode as \\"another crazy Brian and Stewie adventure\\". He noted that the story did not have \\"the most interesting plot\\", but got \\"more and more entertaining and so much fun\\" with every new world they featured in. He concluded that \\"coupled with Brian and Stewie front and centre, it made for the best Family Guy episode ever.\\" The director of \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", Greg Colton, was awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation, for storyboarding the episode, on August 21, 2010, at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards's Creative Arts Awards. Although the Parents Television Council, a frequent Family Guy critic, did not name Family Guy its \\"Worst TV Show of the Week\\" for \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", it did refer to this episode in its negative review of the following episode, \\"Family Goy\\". The review noted that the appearance of the Griffin family's Jewish neighbor, Mort Goldman, in \\"Multiverse\\" was notable since, in the Disney parody, Mort was beaten to a bloody pulp by Disney- inspired versions of the cast – a reference to Walt Disney's purported antisemitism. The review goes on to state, \\"apparently, in Seth MacFarlane's mind, the best way to fight anti-Semitism is with more anti-Semitism. One must wonder what young, angry, disaffected bigots tuning into the show must think. All they see is a nebbish stereotype getting his teeth knocked out of his skull and a blood-soaked Star of David tumbling to the floor.\\" In a 2012 interview, Seth MacFarlane stated: \\"As far as the all-around best episode, \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" would have to be up there.\\" Sequel A video game sequel called Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse was made. It is also a continuation of the season 9 episode \\"The Big Bang Theory\\".

The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound Recording (James L. Fields). It is also known as Dollar A Year Man. Plot Abner Peabody runs the Jot 'Em Down general store in Pine Ridge, Arkansas. When listening to the radio one day, he hears Chester Marshall, head of the Civilian Aid on the War Effort Board, plead to the people and asking for help to come up with inventions and ideas that could be used to improve the life during war times. Abner decides to build a chemistry lab in his own basement. Soon he develops a new improved formula for manufacturing synthetic rubber. His partner Lum Edwards wants them to go to Washington D.C. To present their work to Marshall. When the two men arrive in Washington, they have a hard time finding housing for their stay. They are offered lodging by an unknown man they meet in a park, but it turns out the room they are given is the bedroom display in a department store window. As they wake up in the morning, they are chased out of the store, but encounter an old friend of theirs who is a newspaper columnist, Robert Blevine. Robert invites them to stay at his house instead, and accompanies them to see Marshall. They have to wait in line to see him though, since hoards of people have gathered for the same reason. Robert is scolded by Marshall's secretary because of his harsh articles in the paper about him, while Abner and Lum go see the sights around the city. While resting on a park bench, Lum listens to a conversation a senator has with another man, about drought problems in his state. Lum interrupts the conversation and advises the senator to plant worms to remedy the soil. Lum goes on to advise a congressman on stopping migration from small-towns to the big cities. Lum and Abner develop quite the reputation around Washington, and word gets around that they are great consultants. They get a lot of visitors wanting to get their advice right there on the park bench. After a while Marshall shows up by the bench, and the two men show him their rubber invention. He is very pleased with their discovery and calls for an immediate press conference. During the press conference, Abner is hit in the head by a falling statue, and knocked unconscious. When he wakes up again, he has lost his near memory and forgotten his rubber formula. The press doesn't believe he ever had a working formula and Marshall is publicly humiliated. Marshall gets an ultimatum, to produce Abner's formula in a week or he will lose his job. Marshall decides to accompany Lum and Abner home to Pine Ridge, to try to extract the formula from Abner in his home environment. Abner ultimately gets his memory back as he hits his head once again, and finally remembers the formula on the last day of the ultimatum deadline. Both Lum and Abner are rewarded for their great service to the country, and appointed heads of a special committee on farming problems and Marshall's reputation is restored.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/90664/So-This-Is-Washington/  Cast  *Chester Lauck as Lum Edwards *Norris Goff as Abner *Alan Mowbray as Chester W.

He currently is the head football coach at Marshall University. Early life Holliday was born and raised in Hurricane, West Virginia, where he was a football star as well as a state champion wrestler at Hurricane High School. He graduated from West Virginia University with a bachelor's degree in Physical Education in 1979, then graduated with a master's degree in 1981 in Safety Management. Holliday was also a three-year letterwinner while playing linebacker at West Virginia. Coaching career First stint at West Virginia In 1979, Holliday became a graduate assistant for the West Virginia Mountaineers football team. Then in 1981, he became a part-time assistant until 1982. Holliday became wide receivers coach in 1983 and remained at that position until 1989. In 1990, Holliday became the inside linebackers coach. He remained to coach the linebackers until 1992. In 1993, he returned to coaching the receivers. In 1995, Holliday was promoted to assistant head coach, while still maintaining receivers. During his tenure at West Virginia University under head coach Don Nehlen, Holliday achieved a prestigious record. He coached the top three career and single-season reception leaders in school history and eight of the top ten players in both categories. He also coached the leading receivers in the Big East in 1996, 1997, and 1998 while also coaching three of the top six receivers in Big East history. He coached third-team All-American receiver Reggie Rembert, three- time all-Big East receiver Rahsaan Vanterpool, all-Big East receiver David Saunders, all-Big East receiver Shawn Foreman, an all-Big East receiver Khori Ivy during his tenure and also was responsible for seven eventual NFL draftees. Holliday was also the main recruiting coach in the Florida-area for West Virginia University. Holliday was responsible for recruiting major stars, such as linebacker Steve Grant, and became one of the best recruiters in the nation. He also helped the Mountaineers to 12 bowl games in his twenty years at West Virginia University. NC State In 2000, Holliday left West Virginia for North Carolina State. There he became the associate head coach and wide receivers coach. He remained at NC State until 2004. During his time in North Carolina, Holliday coached three of the top eight receivers in school history: Koren Robinson, Bryan Peterson and Jerricho Cotchery. In 2001, the squad set school records for completion percentage and fewest turnovers, while the 2002 team led the ACC in scoring. That squad also finished with school records of total yards, passing yards, most points scored, and most first downs in a season. The 2003 squad then set records in pass attempts, pass completions, passing yards, passing yards per game, passing touchdowns, and pass completion percentage. Florida In 2005, Holliday traveled to the University of Florida and became the Gators' associate head coach, safeties coach, and recruiting coordinator under head coach Urban Meyer. In 2005, Holliday was named one of Rivals.com's Top 25 Recruiters, while also tutoring a secondary that only allowed 52.3% of passing to be completed which was 16th best in the nation. He guided safety Reggie Nelson to a consensus All-American honor and to become a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award and Bronko Nagurski Trophy in 2006. Also in that season, the Gators' pass defense efficiency was fourth-ranked nationally and second in the SEC while only surrendering a nationally tenth-ranked 10 touchdowns all season and sixth in the nation in scoring defense. Second stint at West Virginia When West Virginia University head coach Rich Rodriguez left the team before their Fiesta Bowl game to assume the head coaching position at the University of Michigan, Doc Holliday's name surfaced as a candidate in the Mountaineers' head coach search. Holliday was named by several news outlets to be the front-runner for the job, outpacing former Auburn head coach Terry Bowden, Florida State offensive line coach Rick Trickett, and Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster. Instead, on January 12, 2008, it was announced that Holliday was to be named West Virginia's associate head coach, tight end coach, fullback coach, and recruiting coordinator for head coach Bill Stewart. Doc Holliday and Stewart helped pull in a recruiting class with 23 letters of intents on signing day. The 2008 class, led by 5-star offensive guard Josh Jenkins from Parkersburg, West Virginia, was ranked 36th by Scout.com and 44th by Rivals.com. Marshall On December 16, 2009, sources, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Charleston Gazette that no deal has been finalized, but that Holliday was the apparent choice to succeed Mark Snyder, who chose to resign rather than be fired as the MU coach. On December 17, 2009, Marshall made it official naming Holliday as the next head coach for the Thundering Herd football team. Marshall athletic director Mike Hamrick said Holliday signed a five-year contract and would be paid $600,000 per season. In July 2014, Holliday signed a two-year contract extension.http://www.charlestondailymail.com/article/20140714/DM03/140719703 After leading Marshall to its first Conference USA championship in 2014, Holliday was named C-USA Coach of the Year. He also received a contract extension through 2021 and a salary of $755,000 a year at the end of the season.

When a spider gives Arthur a grain of rice containing a distress-call, which he believes has come from the Minimoys, he returns to his grandparents' house, where the Bogo Matassalai's attempt to give him Minimoy stature through a telescope fails, and they instead wrap him in vines of increasing tightness until he falls as a drop of sap into the Minimoy Max's bar. En route to investigate the Minimoys' condition, Arthur and Max rescue Betameche, who leads Arthur to the King. He then learns that Selenia is held by Maltazard, who is inspired to invade the human world by increasing his own size. Maltazard tricks the Minimoys into completing his design.

History Before North Raleigh United Methodist Church had been established, the Raleigh Board of Missions had considered establishing a new church in the North Raleigh area. In the spring of 1971, several laymen met and discussed the area's need for a church. The first gathering consisted of thirteen different families. The meeting place for the church became Monk Chapel, on the grounds of the Methodist Home For Children. Four rotating ministers were assigned by the local bishop to preside over the church. Soon church organizations, including the United Methodist Women & Methodist Men Organization and the Council of Ministries, were installed. In June 1972, the Reverend Sidney Huggins was assigned by the bishop as the first permanent minister of the church. The congregation purchased seven acres of land on Honeycutt Road in Raleigh with financial assistance from the Raleigh Board of Missions, North Carolina Conference, the North Carolina Ten Dollar Club, and the Duke Endowment Fund. The first sanctuary was built in September 1972. A second sanctuary was completed in March 1983 and the Education building was completed in 1987. The current sanctuary was consecrated in February 2006. The church grounds now include the staff offices, sanctuary, fellowship hall, music suite, kitchen, classrooms, conference room, youth center and education building/NRUM Preschool. The Senior Pastor is Duke Lackey and the Associate Pastor is Ashley Will, who both were appointed in June 2017 and started these appointments on July 2, 2017.http://www.nrumc.org/history.htmlThe Executive Pastor Alan Felton is also an appointed pastor, but primarily works as church administrator, with occasional duties in assisting the senior and associate pastors.

Facts At the time, the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) was under the supervision of the Foreign Secretary and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, its primary remit being to promote UK exports to the developing world (\\"aid through trade\\"). During this period, it has been alleged that there was a connection between the granting of aid and the achievement of either foreign policy goals or British companies winning export orders. A scandal erupted concerning the UK funding of a hydroelectric dam on the Pergau River in Malaysia, near the Thai border. Building work began in 1991 with money from the UK foreign aid budget. Concurrently, the Malaysian government bought around £1 billion worth of arms from the UK. The suggested linkage of arms deals to aid became the subject of a UK government inquiry from March 1994. In November 1994, the World Development Movement applied for judicial review. Judgment The High Court of England and Wales held that the Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, had acted ultra vires (outside of his power, and therefore unlawfully) by allocating £234 million towards the funding of the dam, on the grounds that legislation only empowered him to allocate funds to economically sound projects..

The History of Oak Park and River Forest High School covers the history of Oak Park and River Forest High School, located in Oak Park, Illinois, USA, from 1871 to the present. History Nineteenth century Starting in 1871, high school students from Oak Park attended classes in an elementary school. The first class, which contained only three people, graduated in 1877. As early as 1875, there was discussion about constructing a high school in Oak Park. In June 1889, the school board announced that a site on Lake Street between Euclid and East Avenues had been selected for the new high school. Construction began in the spring of 1890. The school was designed by the firm of Thomas & Rapp, and built for an initial cost of the school was listed at US$40,000. The school, Oak Park-Ridgeland High School, was opened for public inspection on the afternoon of 1 January 1892. The building was designed to be used for kindergarten and grades 5-12. Among the features of the building were a state- of-the-art ventilation system that changed the air in the entire building once each six minutes. The basement, which would hold industrial arts shops, and the third floor, which would hold the gymnasium, science labs, and rooms for cooking and sewing rooms. The 15 member graduating class of 1894, grouped according to course work in \\"Classical\\", \\"Latin\\", or \\"Modern language\\" received a graduation address from John M. Coulter, then serving as president of Lake Forest University. In 1899, the tuition charged to residents of River Forest and Maywood was raised, prompting the students from those towns to move their students to the recently completed Austin High School in Chicago. 1901-1920 By 1904, the towns decided a new high school building was needed.Decide Oak Park School Site Today; Chicago Daily Tribune (1872-1963); 27 February 1904; ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849 - 1986), ProQuest. Web; p. 9; accessed 5 August 2009 In December 1904, the location at East and Ontario Streets was selected by voters.VOTERS SELECT SCHOOL SITE: Oak PArk Election Fixes Choice of East and Ontario Streets for $160,000 Building; Chicago Daily Tribune (1872-1963); 4 December 1904; ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849 - 1986), ProQuest. Web; accessed 6 August 2009 The original school site was sold in 1916 for $25,000. A new building, designed to hold 800 students was opened in 1907 in the school's current location, however, by 1908, the school was declared defective, and required additional work, with the concrete floors specifically cited as being unable to support the full weight of potential people that might stand on it. The school eventually filed suit against the contractors. For many years, students at the school had formed fraternities and sororities. In the wake of a student's near death during an initiation in 1907, the citizens of the community began to ask for the secret organizations to be disbanded. In the summer of 1907, school officials formally informed parents of the school's opposition to these groups, and that parents should be wary about permitting students to join these groups. As school started in 1908, the school opted to require all students (unless parents were opposed) to sign an oath not to join any secret societies. With the pledges sent out, the secret societies were effectively banned at the school, though not without a fight. The adult sponsor of one fraternity (on whose property the fraternity's house was located) decided to defend the system. It soon became clear that the fight was between representatives of the \\"old guard\\" of Oak Park which favored the societies, and newer families who were against them. Even as the last sororities submitted to signing the oath, the fraternities held out hope that they and their parents would prevail. While continued existence of the fraternities was tolerated for a time, by early 1909, the last remaining members were expelled when they failed to comply with the oaths they had signed. After the last fraternity engaged the services of an attorney to defend themselves, the attorney informed the members and their families that the school was within its rights, leading the last holdouts to renounce their membership, and rejoin the school community. Problems with secret societies continued sporadically into 1911, when students were again given the choice of renouncing membership in the groups or face expulsion. Nine students were ultimately expelled. Four of these boys applied to attend one of the public schools in Chicago, and were rejected. One of the nine students was eventually reinstated by a judge, who openly called these secret societies \\"enemies of the state and foes of our Christian civilization\\". Expulsions over the offense continued in 1915, though with the added twist of several girls gaining the support of Mrs. Catherine Wright, the wife of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1916, parents supportive of secret societies attempted to get elected to the school board, but failed when the leadership withdrew from the election. 1908 saw approval for the expansion of the athletic facilities with five new tennis courts, a new quarter-mile cinder track, and outdoor basketball courts. On 16 January 1914, the school opened up its new field house which ranked among the largest indoor athletic facilities for a secondary school in the country, which included a one-fourteenth of a mile indoor track. During the years 1916 and 1917, Ernest Hemingway was a contributor to the school newspaper and literary magazine. Several of these works were collected in Hemingway at Oak Park High: The High School Writings of Ernest Hemingway, 1916-1917. Among these works was a short story, A Matter of Colour, which appears to be a prequel to his later short story The Killers, explaining the reason for the action in that story. 1921-40 On 27 September 1924 OPRF dedicated its new athletic stadium with a celebration that included a 13–0 win in football over Austin High School. The fight against secret societies among students again raised its head. In May 1926, the school issued one year suspensions to 53 students under the claim that their Sunday school classes served as a front for fraternity membership. The boys filed suit against the school claiming that they did not know they would be punished so strongly, with one prominent parent claiming the school was acting to erase its image as an \\"athletic\\" school. When the boys won the case, they arrived at school to gain admittance, only to see the Superintendent cancel classes so that students could attend a \\"clean alleys\\" parade. Upon appeal, the judge reversed his initial ruling, and denied the boys' lawsuit. Despite missing graduation for some students, the remaining students continued to appeal throughout the summer. On 4 September, the parties arrived at a compromise where graduates would receive their diplomas, underclassmen would return to class, though students would be barred from extracurricular activities, and would be required to help root out secret societies. Parents who had started a petition drive against the principal were also required to destroy the petitions. November 1927 saw the announcement of new construction. The first to be completed was a new gymnasium for girls and a fieldhouse for boys, which would include a dirt floor and an indoor track. One report stated that the school would thus have \\"the largest and most complete high school athletic layout in the world\\". These facilities, costing $750,000 were ready in August 1928. OPRF was routinely hosted community lecture events and several charitable fundraisers that often attracted notable people. On the evening of 9 November 1936, the school hosted a talk by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. On 14 October 1940, the school hosted the exiled Archduke Felix of Austria for a talk. On 22 October 1940, the school hosted Cornelia Otis Skinner, who presented some costumed monologues at the school as a part of a fundraiser for the local infant welfare society. A benefit concert at the school on 8 November 1940 featured violinist Efrem Zimbalist. 22 January 1941 saw a lecture by polar explorer Rear Admiral Richard Byrd. 1941-1960 With the outbreak of World War II, OPRF opened its doors to a University of Illinois sponsored war industries college to educate men and women in skills needed to perform in necessary industries. At least as early as 1940, interest was shown in opening a second high school for the town of River Forest. In 1946, approval was given for River Forest to form their own high school district. By 1949, River Forest was still a separate district, but had not begun to build a high school, forcing the district to pay tuition for each student still attending Oak Park High School. In late May 1949, petitions were presented asking for a referendum to reunite the two districts, with the county superintendent announcing that the reunited school district would officially become Consolidated High School District 200 when the vote from both districts favored reunification. The successful election resulted in the call for the election of a new school board. The 1940s saw still more lecturers and performers come to the school for various functions. 12 October 1942 saw a talk on \\"Liberty vs. Oppression\\" by Ève Curie, the daughter and biographer of Marie Curie. Carmen Amaya and her band of dancers performed 16 October 1942. Soprano Helen Jepson performed on 24 March 1944. Actress Ilka Chase gave a talk on 21 April 1944. 11 October 1944 saw a performance by magician Harlan Tarbell. Hypnotist and \\"mind reader\\" Dr. Franz Polgar was the entertainment at the school on 25 April 1945. In March 1946, the school hosted a two-day conference to discuss the future of the Soviet Union in world affairs which was chaired by William McGovern and Maynard C. Krueger. Eugene List performed on piano on 29 October 1946. Will Durant, philosopher and historian, gave a lecture on 17 October 1949. The 1950–51 school year opened with a $200,000 renovation of the school's auditorium. While the auditorium's capacity dropped from 1,300 to 1,200, the renovations included a new stage and dressing rooms. Two communities which had been sending students to OPRF withdrew from the district in the early 1950s. Elmwood Park incorporated its own high school district and constructed Elmwood Park High School in 1954, while the east part of River Grove was incorporated into Leyden High School. 1954 saw an addition to the field house and an additional $200,000 in improvements. In 1956, voters rejected a bond issue, which requested permission to raise $2.8 million for renovations and expansion. A $2 million bond issue was approved for renovations in 1957. A new wing including ten classrooms and a new library was finished in the spring of 1959. The 1950s saw more notable lecturers and performers take to the stage at the school. Princess Ileana of Romania gave a talk about the effects of communism on her country on 8 October 1951. Claude Raines performed readings of literature on 19 October 1953. The former crown prince of Austria, Otto von Habsburg lectured on Europe and world security on 18 October 1954. Lt. General Mark Clark discussed a recent book he had written on 1 November 1954, while Willy Ley talked on the new space program on 7 February 1955. Polar explorer and president of Carleton College, Laurence McKinley Gould spoke on 28 October 1957. Vance Packard an author and social critic talked about his book, The Hidden Persuaders and American morality on 17 November 1958. 1961-1980 In July 1966, preliminary plans were announced for a US$5.7 million, addition and remodeling of the school which would include three air conditioned floors, a 1,700-seat auditorium, a 400-seat theater, and a 200-seat forensics theater were all part of the plan. Bidding for the addition opened in September 1966. In conjunction with the new construction, the school received a US$1.5 million Title III grant to expand and redevelop the school library. Construction was underway by November, with the price tag now standing at US$10.4 million. The project was not complete when the district was required to ask the residents for a US$2.9 million bond issue, which was approved in December 1967. In 1967, there was discussion of the Oak Park Elementary School District merging with the high school district to form a unit district. In the summer of 1969, the school's orchestra planned to take a 22-day 8 city tour of Europe that was to include stops in Moscow and Leningrad, becoming the first American high school orchestra to perform in the Soviet Union. However, the group's itinerary was forced to change. The tour included a concert in St Mark's Square and an audience with Pope Paul VI, as well as a concert at Beethovenhalle in Bonn. The tour to Moscow and Leningrad (and Amsterdam and Vienna) took place over the 1970-71 winter break. In December 1976, voters approved a 77 cent-per- US$100 assessed property value increase to improve the school's educational fund. The school continued to host a number of notable visitors. In February 1961, the school hosted alum, Illinois Governor Otto Kerner, Jr. and General Alfred Gruenther on the topic of national goals. Congressman and staunch anti- communist Walter Judd spoke at the school in 1962. Broadway producers José Quintero and Theodore Mann presented the play Under Milk Wood in October 1962, followed a week later with a talk by Baroness Maria von Trapp, and in November with a talk on contemporary problems by U.S. Senator John Tower. In October 1963 the importance of education was the emphasis of a talk by former heavyweight boxing champion, Jack Dempsey. The remainder of 1963 and into 1964 saw visits from former Cincinnati mayor Charles Taft, MP Fergus Montgomery, naturalist and author Joy Adamson, and writer Art Buchwald. Winston Churchill, grandson of the British Prime Minister, spoke in 1965. The 1969-70 lecture season included talks by Percy Julian on the race crisis in America, Dr. David E. Smith on drug abuse, and Bruno Bettelheim on the generation gap. The 1970-71 lecture season included William F. Buckley, Jr., Roger Hilsman, and Bill Veeck. Senator Charles H. Percy lectured on current Congressional issues in October 1971. Governor Richard B. Ogilvie made a campaign stop at the school in 1972. March 1976 saw a performance by Count Basie and his orchestra. Dr. Carolyn R. Payton, director of the Peace Corps spoke at a benefit hosted at the school in November 1978. On 1 October 1980, three days before the 1980 presidential election, Vice President Walter Mondale gave a talk to 1,000 students and a press conference at the school. 1981-onward In the autumn of 1983, the school inducted the first members of its alumni hall of fame. 1983 also saw OPRF among 32 Chicago-area school districts who had members of Lyndon LaRouche's National Democratic Policy Committee run for their school board. Among the changes these candidates supported are an end to \\"the hoax of new math\\", the end of all ecology classes, the elimination of non-classical music, and the end of vocational education classes. In Oak Park-River Forest, as with most of the districts, the candidates were not elected. By the 1990s, the concern over this, which began to include concerns over violence spreading from other schools, even required the hiring of private detectives to investigate student residency. 1983 also saw OPRF join a trend in identifying students (42 in 1983) who were nonresidents of the district (mostly from Chicago), and dismissing them. In some cases, this involved sending security guards to the local elevated train platforms to identify students arriving from the city. The autumn of 1983 also saw the school caught up in the deportation of an employee of 25 years. In 1982, the school's head custodian had admitted to the U.S. Justice Department that he had not been open about his tenure as a member of the Waffen-SS at the Gross-Rosen concentration camp during World War II. After the Justice Department initial deportation hearings ended, the school opted to dismiss the custodian. While there was general community agreement, there were those who opposed the dismissal (including at least one Jewish student), citing his exemplary behavior, caring for students, and hard work. The former custodian was deported to West Germany after his final appeal was denied by Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens in 1987. Walter Mondale returned to the school as a presidential candidate, making a public call for Ronald Reagan to suspend underground nuclear testing. Former U.S. Senator Adlai Stevenson III announced his second-time candidacy for Illinois governor during a speech at the school in October 1985. In 1987, the school board considered a proposal that would have mandated testing for AIDS in any student (with parental notification) or staff member whom the superintendent had \\"reasonable cause\\" in being infected. In 1989, the OPRF school board drafted a fourth revision of its anti-discrimination policy, and for the first time included sexual orientation as being protected from harassment. At the next board meeting, there were passionate voices both approving and disapproving of the new policy. In December, the board approved the policy, and became the first high school in Illinois to extend protection to homosexuals. The 1990s saw the school go through financial difficulties. 68 employees, including tenured teachers faced layoffs in 1991. By 1994, the school was facing a US$3 million deficit, and approached the voters to ask for an 18% tax hike to cover the deficit. By a 7,190-5,960 vote, the tax increase failed. While the money was needed, the board opted against moving too quickly for another tax referendum, and decided to not ask for a referendum in the November election. The school attempted a second tax increase referendum in the spring of 1996, this time asking for a 6.75% increase after having made US$5 million in cutbacks and emphasizing the reduction in workforce. Just weeks before the referendum, the district and teachers negotiated a contract which called for a partial wage freeze as well as the assumption of more health care costs by teachers. Days before the referendum, the Illinois State Board of Education announced that the school was on the state's \\"financial watch list\\". The referendum was successful. In 1998, it was reported that the school was in need of US$18 million in repairs. The board responded by selling US$19 million in bonds to raise money to make repairs, including a new roof, general upgrades to come into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, new ceilings, new windows, and new insulation. The monies would also be used for moving the tennis courts and baseball field, as well as demolition and reconstruction of the football stadium to give it a north–south orientation. As a part of the athletic field upgrades, the school was able to purchase neighboring property, and then went to court to secure more property from the village. The school paid US$800,000 for the property from the village. The wage freeze and higher health care benefits had been negotiated by faculty representatives, because the school's teachers were not unionized. In 1998, as a result of these actions, there was enough interest among the faculty to vote on unionization. In February 1998, 117 of the 176 voting teachers approved ending the informal teachers; senate and joining the Illinois branch of the National Education Association. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the African-American population of the school increased. In 1992, the Oak Park NAACP called for an independent citizens group to investigate the disproportionate number of suspensions and expulsions given out to African- American students, because there were teachers who were not familiar with working with African-American students. The situation escalated in 1993 when two teachers were found to have been involved in an altercation, with the white male receiving a letter of reprimand, and the African-American woman receiving the support of the NAACP and NOW, among others. In May 1994, the school closed a mentoring room set up by an African-American parents' group, and, citing an \\"internal leadership issue\\" with the organization, denied further use of school facilities for their meetings. Nonetheless, the group defied the ban, and met at the school in October. Homecoming 1994 added to the issues the school was facing. Initially, two young ladies were refused the right to purchase tickets to a \\"couples only\\" dance, the school quickly changed the policy and permitted single ticket sales. Despite the quick change, minority parents, and members of the gay and lesbian community formed a new organization to address issues of race and sexual orientation at the school. Specifically, the group demanded an increase in minority hiring (17 of the school's 157 teachers were minorities, compared to almost 36% of the student population) and a revision of the most recent code of conduct. When the school board members were invited to meet with the group (as well as with teachers, students, and two trustees of the town), no members of the board appeared. In 2004, the African-American parents organization was able to convince state legislators that an investigation of the school's discipline system was necessary, and the Illinois State Board of Education was charged with doing that. Despite some parents' and students' complaints regarding an infringement of students' privacy in a public place, the school installed security cameras as a part of a technology infrastructure upgrade in the summer of 1996. A long-standing tradition at the school called for young women to wear long, white gowns and carry a dozen red roses, and for young men to wear a dark sports jacket, white dress shirt and red necktie at graduation exercises. In 1998, one potential valedictorian refused to wear a dress. Even after she was named valedictorian, the school refused to change tradition, forcing her to receive her diploma from the principal's office, and forego giving her address. In 2016, this policy changed such that any student, regardless of gender, could wear \\"an all-white or all-dark dress, skirt and top, pant suit, or suit.\\" In 2018, the District 200 Board of Education voted to change the commencement attire to all caps and gowns.\\"OPRF High School to Promote Equity With Caps, Gowns\\" In 2003, the WB Network aired the reality series of High School Reunion, featuring alumni of OPRF. During the 2015–2016 school year, documentarian Steve James followed 12 students of OPRF with his film crew to shoot a documentary television series, eventually titled America to Me. In the series, James examines the complex racial disparities and achievement gaps found in what is \\"a well-funded center of education in an affluent, progressive community\\". The series began airing on August 26, 2018 on the Starz network.

Turnout was 63.5% in the first round and 68.1% in the second.Nohlen et al., p337 Overview The first round was held on 16 March 1998. Prime Minister and acting President Robert Kocharyan and Karen Demirchyan, the leader of Soviet Armenia from 1974 to 1988, won the most votes: 38.5% and 30.5% respectively. Demirchyan, who came in second, had been absent from politics for 10 years and had been in business. Demirchyan was seen as a good old man from the Soviet times who could \\"return to the certainties of the past and distaste for mafia capitalism personified by Ter- Petrosyan's rule.\\" Demirchyan was very popular among the Armenian public. A poll quoted by Western diplomats, showed that Demirchyan had the support of the 53% of Armenians, while Kocharyan was favored by only 36%. He was also preferable for the West, since he had more moderate approach to the Karabakh conflict settlement, while Kocharyan was seen as a vivid nationalist. The second round of the election was held on March 30 between Kocharyan and Demirchyan. Kocharyan won with 58.9% of the vote. The final results showed Demirchyan having only 40.1% of the vote. The British Helsinki Human Rights Group claimed that \\"ordinary Armenians turned to Robert Kocharian as someone untainted by mafia connections and the intrigues of Yerevan politics.\\" The OSCE observation mission described the first round as \\"deeply flawed,\\" while their final report stated that the mission found \\"serious flaws\\" and that the election did not meet the OSCE standards. Although Demirchyan didn't officially dispute the election results, he never accepted them and did not congratulate Kocharyan. Results Analysis Hrant Mikayelian, researcher at the Caucasus Institute, estimated, based on turnout analysts, that actual results of the first round were as follows: Kocharyan at 32.6%, Demirchyan at 33.5%, Manukyan at 13.3% and Badalyan at 12%. As for the final result, Mikayelian estimated that Kocharyan would still win if no electoral violations took place, but with a smaller margin: 50.6% vs Demirchyan's 48.3%.

The first English-language translation of the Mahabharata, by the scholarly Kisari Mohan Ganguli, acknowledges the influence of Nilakantha's commentary.Translator's Preface The Clay Sanskrit Library's project of translating the Mahabharata used the version known to Nilakantha rather than the critical edition.Clay Sanskrit Library FAQ In the recent past, he \\"has been maligned without warrant\\" by modern scholars, but his \\"understandings underlie more than a little of what is in the English language renderings of the epic.\\"James L.

Early life and career Tod was born on 3 November 1905. On graduation from Royal Military College, Sandhurst he was commissioned into the Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders as a second lieutenant on 29 January 1925. On 14 December 1932 (now a lieutenant) he was seconded for service with the Colonial Office, joining 4th Battalion, Nigeria Regiment, Royal West African Frontier Force. He was promoted captain on 6 June 1935, and took command of one of the battalion's companies. His secondment ended on 1 August 1938, and he returned to the UK, taking up regimental duties with 1st Battalion, Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders in early 1939. Second World War In March 1940, following the outbreak of the Second World War, Tod volunteered to join the Independent Companies being raised for the Norwegian Campaign. He was promoted to acting major on 2 April and became Officer Commanding No. 6 Independent Company on 25 April. He held that post until June when he was tasked with raising No. 11 Independent Company.No. 11 Independent Company was raised on 14 June from volunteers for commando service and members from the recently disbanded No. 9 Independent Company. Parker 2000, p. 21. As commander of this company, he led them on two \\"commando\\" raids shortly afterwards, one to Boulogne in France known as Operation Collar, and Operation Ambassador, which was a raid on the German occupied Guernsey.Saunders 1959, pp. 15–22.Chappell 1996, p. 5. These were the first two such raids carried out by British commandos during the war.Parker 2000, p. 21. Just before the second of these raids he was confirmed as a temporary major on 2 July 1940. Later, on 20 January 1942 Tod was promoted to acting lieutenant colonel, his majority was made substantive on 29 January, and his acting rank was made temporary on 20 April. Later in the year he took command of No. 9 Commando.Saunders 1959, p. 199. In late 1943 No. 9 Commando was detailed to take part in the Italian Campaign. Tod was later commended for his leadership during a raid across the river Garigliano on 29/30 December 1943 and during Operation Shingle, the Allied amphibious attack on Anzio on 22 January 1944. In the follow-up to the landings, the commando was ordered to take two hills to the north of Monte Ornito on the night of 23/24 February 1944. For his leadership during the attack, Tod was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 29 June 1944. The recommendation for the award describes the events of the night. The commando left its start lines at 19:30, and at about 21:30 came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire. Tod undertook a personal reconnaissance, and the ensuing attack captured a German pill box and 23 men. The commando resumed its journey towards its objective, but immediately came under heavy artillery and mortar fire which continued to build in intensity as they approached the main objective, \\"Point 803\\". As Tod gave orders for the main attack to begin, four out of five troop leaders, the intelligence officer, and the regimental sergeant major were all killed or wounded by the shelling. Tod retained control, ordering the leading troop to make the attack, supported by two other troops, while the remaining two troops were to take up covering positions to the south, where they would hopefully be out of the majority of the shelling. At this point, Tod himself was wounded in both arms and both legs, but still managed to order his adjutant forward to take command of the attack. Tod then lost consciousness for about ten minutes, but after coming round, began to oversee the evacuation of the wounded. The troops detailed to attack the objective managed to attain it, but were taking heavy casualties, so Tod ordered a retreat to defensive positions on the southern slope of Mount Ornito. Tod was among the last group to fall back, and had to be supported by the adjutant as they made their way back. He remained in command until 10:30 the following morning when his brigade commander ordered him to seek medical attention. According to the recommendation he \\"undoubtedly saved a critical situation and had a very steadying influence on his unit\\". Another officer, George Davy, later described how that morning Tod was far more concerned about the injuries to his RSM than he was by his own wounds. Just under a month later, on 19 March 1944, the commando was ordered to carry out a diversionary attack on a dry valley in the Campo di Carne area, and for his leadership on this occasion Tod was awarded a Bar to his DSO on 20 July 1944. Again the recommendation for the award describes events. The commando's attack began at 02:00, they entered the valley and began to clear it, but it soon became apparent that the defending force was considerably larger than anticipated. Later intelligence showed that they had been facing a whole German battalion. Realising that further progress along the valley would be impossible, Tod ordered his men to take up defensive positions. They held these until the following evening, despite being under fire from three sides, and one particularly strong counterattack by the Germans. Tod was painfully wounded in the early afternoon, but continued to lead from the front. During the German counterattack, German grenades were exploding in his command position. With nightfall, the commando withdrew, bringing in all their wounded. The recommendation especially mentions Tod's \\"complete disregard for his own personal safety\\", and his \\"outstanding display of coolness, courage and leadership at a time when such qualities were most urgently required.\\" Tod then served in the Greek islands with Foxforce in the summer of 1944,Jones 2005, p. 34. when 9 Commando was made part of 2nd Special Service Brigade under the command of Land Forces Adriatic, led by George Davy. Davy ordered the commando to Kythera, ready for a move to the Peloponnese in anticipation of the German withdrawal from Greece. Here, British forces were being sucked into the emerging Greek Civil War, and often found themselves between opposing communist and anti-communist Greek forces. They managed to defuse many of these potential conflicts, saving many lives in the process. Finally they were ordered to take two islands off Piraeus in order to provide security for Royal Navy minesweepers operating in the area in preparation for the arrival of larger British force under Ronald Scobie. Orders that they were not to enter Athens itself did not reach them, and Tod ensured that the airfield and various strategic points in Athens were under British control prior to Scobie's arrival. Tod was awarded the freedom of the city by Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens, and Davy credited him as \\"one of the two British officers who kept Greece on the free side of the Iron Curtain\\". Tod was then promoted to acting colonel, and appointed brigadier in command of the 2nd Special Service Brigade on 18 October 1944.Saunders 1959, p. 179. With them he returned to Italy to lead them in the Spring 1945 offensive and until the end of the war.Chappell 1996, p. 31. For this, and in particular the capture of Comacchio, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 20 September 1945. Retirement On 7 August 1948 Tod retired with the rank of honorary brigadier. He remained in the reserve of officers until 3 November 1955. He died on 5 April 1975.

Known in its first year as Rehoboth Christian Secondary School, it moved to its current location at Kenwick in 1979, becoming Rehoboth Christian High School, in keeping with conventional local nomenclature practice at the time. For many years the Primary and Secondary Campuses operated distinctly, but in 2005 Primary and Pre-Primary classes also commenced on the Kenwick site. An earlier second Primary work at the southern Perth suburb of Yangebup, commenced at that more remote location from its core population because of restrictions imposed by the Hawke-Keating Labor government in the early 1990s, had ultimately failed because of its distance from the other campuses, and closed its doors after 10 years.

A company or a (natural or legal) person that intends to run a business can pledge a company mortgage by registering a specific amount in the corporate mortgage register. The pledge is not tied to a particular property at a particular point in time. Instead the property can change over time. The idea behind this is the entrepreneur's personal property can be used as collateral for credit without him or her having to give up having the assets at his or her disposal. The register is kept by the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Bolagsverket), which issues proof of the registered pledge, called a mortgage letter (Inteckningsbrev). This proof can be either written or electronic. A written mortgage letter is pledged when the businessman hands it over as collateral to a creditor. An electronic mortgage letter is deemed to be pledged when the creditor has been registered as the bearer (holder) of the mortgage letter. The company mortgage gives special priority rights on a businessman’s personal property that belongs to the business other than cash or bank funds, stock or other publicly traded financial instruments, property that cannot be seized or be included in a bankruptcy, or property that can be pledged in other ways, such as aircraft and ships during both the seizure of assets and bankruptcy under §5 of the Priority Rights Act (Förmånsrättslagen). A company mortgage pledged before another company mortgage has priority. Company mortgages pledged on the same day have equal rights. At the request of the bearer of a company mortgage letter, the holding can be registered in the corporate mortgage register. A decision by the registration authority may be appealed to District Court (Tingsrätt). In the appeal the Act on Court Cases (Lagen om Domstolsärenden) is applied. Anyone wishing to appeal a decision of the registration authority should do so in writing. The letter must be submitted to the registration authority. The provisions relating to the company mortgage imply a return to the rules on company mortgages that applied before 2004.

Founded during Moldavia's existence as a state, it was erected and dedicated by Moldavian Prince Alexandru Lăpuşneanu in 1562, and originally functioned as nunnery. The establishment acquired a significant historical position in Romanian education during the early 19th century, when it functioned as a seminary and the first-ever institution to provide secondary training in the Romanian language. The seminary ceased to exist later in the same century, and, in 1905, was replaced by a psychiatric hospital. The monastery continued to function until the communist period, when it became a parish church. It has afterward been functioning as a church serving the Socola Psychiatric University Hospital. History Lăpușneanu ordered work to begin on the monastery building in 1551, to replace an older church, the work being completed in 1562. Scurt istoric, at the Socola Church official site, p.1; retrieved August 24, 2009 The dedication was made by the monarch, his wife Ruxandra and his daughter Soltana as ktitors, with Soltana also serving as the first head of what was then the Socola nunnery. The institution also housed a school, which offered training for both nuns and laywomen for the surrounding community. The name, which carries no meaning in Romanian, was probably borrowed from a Slavic source, from sokol, or \\"hawk\\" (allegedly in connection to the practice of falconry in its immediate vicinity). \\"Socola, şcoală şi ospiciu\\", in Jurnalul Naţional, January 22, 2006 The seminary was set up in 1803, during the reign of Phanariote Prince Alexander Mourousis, as the first secondary education institution to provide teaching in the vernacular (as opposed to Greek, Slavonic or other liturgical languages), and one of the first formal schools in the country.Drace-Francis, p.49; Hitchins, p.119 The decision behind this belonged to Moldavian Metropolitan Veniamin Costachi, whose \\"primary objective\\", according to American historian Keith Hitchins, \\"was to improve the training of the clergy\\" as part of a \\"master plan to modernize Moldavian education\\" and tone down \\"the influence of Greek and the Greek professors at the princely academy in Iași.\\"Hitchins, p.119 In the same period, Moldavia, like the southern Danubian Principality of Wallachia, witnessed a revival of monastic activity.Hitchins, p.120 In order for the seminary to start functioning, the nuns were moved to Agapia Monastery, and the Agapia monks took their place.

The initiative on par with other such encouraged immigrations, officially adopted as measures for improving the quality of teaching.Drace-Francis, p.111 The institution, known in New Latin as Seminaria Veniamina, gained in prestige and hosted celebrated educators such as Melchisedec of Roman, Neofit Scriban and Filaret Scriban. It was also the alma mater of Ion Creangă, later known as a major contributor to the literature of Romania. The school was occupied by Russian forces during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, and, a few months later, accidentally burned down.Drace-Francis, p.52 The institution was however restored, and it was here that, in 1859, the Moldo-Wallachian union was celebrated by the newly elected Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Scurt istoric, at the Socola Church official site, p.3; retrieved August 24, 2009 In 1886, five years after the proclamation of a Kingdom of Romania, the monastery was subject to restructuring: the seminary was moved uptown, into the previous residence of former Prince Mihail Sturdza, and a reputedly miraculous icon of the Virgin Mary was moved into the Metropolitan Cathedral. Six years later, Socola came to the interest of physician Alexandru Şuţu, who sought to generate the practice of modern psychiatry in Romania, on the basis of Western European models. He therefore proposed the building of a psychiatric hospital in close proximity to the monastery, a project approved by Parliament, but effected only in 1905 (due to poor allocation of funds). It was located over the former seminary, and was later assigned as a college hospital to the University of Iaşi (later University of Medicine and Pharmacy). Socola ceased to function as a monastery during the communist period, when it became a regular parish church for the neighborhood.

Features In its earliest state, the Socola Monastery church, built entirely in stone, was only as long as its present-day nave, featuring a single tower and narrow windows placed high on each side wall.

Under the administration of Metropolitan Costachi, the porch was extended to become a narthex accommodating a bell tower (built in brick), while the existing stone tower was redesigned to resemble the new one, and the windows covered and replaced with ten new and larger ones.

It involves developing efficient algorithms, data structures, visualization and communication tools to orchestrate the integration of large quantities of biological data with the goal of computer modeling. It is also directly associated with bioinformatics, computational biology and Artificial life. It involves the use of computer simulations of the many cellular subsystems such as the networks of metabolites and enzymes which comprise metabolism, signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. The complex network of biochemical reaction/transport processes and their spatial organization make the development of a predictive model of a living cell a grand challenge for the 21st century. Overview The eukaryotic cell cycle is very complex and is one of the most studied topics, since its misregulation leads to cancers. It is possibly a good example of a mathematical model as it deals with simple calculus but gives valid results. Two research groups have produced several models of the cell cycle simulating several organisms. They have recently produced a generic eukaryotic cell cycle model which can represent a particular eukaryote depending on the values of the parameters, demonstrating that the idiosyncrasies of the individual cell cycles are due to different protein concentrations and affinities, while the underlying mechanisms are conserved (Csikasz-Nagy et al., 2006). By means of a system of ordinary differential equations these models show the change in time (dynamical system) of the protein inside a single typical cell; this type of model is called a deterministic process (whereas a model describing a statistical distribution of protein concentrations in a population of cells is called a stochastic process). To obtain these equations an iterative series of steps must be done: first the several models and observations are combined to form a consensus diagram and the appropriate kinetic laws are chosen to write the differential equations, such as rate kinetics for stoichiometric reactions, Michaelis-Menten kinetics for enzyme substrate reactions and Goldbeter–Koshland kinetics for ultrasensitive transcription factors, afterwards the parameters of the equations (rate constants, enzyme efficiency coefficients and Michaelis constants) must be fitted to match observations; when they cannot be fitted the kinetic equation is revised and when that is not possible the wiring diagram is modified. The parameters are fitted and validated using observations of both wild type and mutants, such as protein half-life and cell size. In order to fit the parameters the differential equations need to be studied. This can be done either by simulation or by analysis. In a simulation, given a starting vector (list of the values of the variables), the progression of the system is calculated by solving the equations at each time-frame in small increments. In analysis, the properties of the equations are used to investigate the behavior of the system depending of the values of the parameters and variables. A system of differential equations can be represented as a vector field, where each vector described the change (in concentration of two or more protein) determining where and how fast the trajectory (simulation) is heading. Vector fields can have several special points: a stable point, called a sink, that attracts in all directions (forcing the concentrations to be at a certain value), an unstable point, either a source or a saddle point which repels (forcing the concentrations to change away from a certain value), and a limit cycle, a closed trajectory towards which several trajectories spiral towards (making the concentrations oscillate). A better representation which can handle the large number of variables and parameters is called a bifurcation diagram (bifurcation theory): the presence of these special steady-state points at certain values of a parameter (e.g. mass) is represented by a point and once the parameter passes a certain value, a qualitative change occurs, called a bifurcation, in which the nature of the space changes, with profound consequences for the protein concentrations: the cell cycle has phases (partially corresponding to G1 and G2) in which mass, via a stable point, controls cyclin levels, and phases (S and M phases) in which the concentrations change independently, but once the phase has changed at a bifurcation event (cell cycle checkpoint), the system cannot go back to the previous levels since at the current mass the vector field is profoundly different and the mass cannot be reversed back through the bifurcation event, making a checkpoint irreversible. In particular the S and M checkpoints are regulated by means of special bifurcations called a Hopf bifurcation and an infinite period bifurcation. 800px Molecular level simulations Cell Collective is a modeling software that enables one to house dynamical biological data, build computational models, stimulate, break and recreate models. The development is led by Tomas Helikar, a researcher within the field of computational biology. It is designed for biologists, students learning about computational biology, teachers focused on teaching life sciences, and researchers within the field of life science. The complexities of math and computer science are built into the backend and one can learn about the methods used for modeling biological species, but complex math equations, algorithms, programming are not required and hence won't impede model building. The mathematical framework behind Cell Collective is based on a common qualitative (discrete) modeling technique where the regulatory mechanism of each node is described with a logical function [for more comprehensive information on logical modeling, see Morris MK, Saez-Rodriguez J, Sorger PK, Lauffenburger DA.. Logic-based models for the analysis of cell signaling networks. Biochemistry (2010) 49(15):3216–24.10.1021/bi902202q Helikar T, Kowal B, Madrahimov A, Shrestha M, Pedersen J, Limbu K, et al. Bio- Logic Builder: a nontechnical tool for building dynamical, qualitative models. PLoS One (2012) 7(10):e46417.10.1371/journal.pone.0046417]. Model validation The model was constructed using local (e.g., protein–protein interaction) information from the primary literature. In other words, during the construction phase of the model, there was no attempt to determine the local interactions based on any other larger phenotypes or phenomena. However, after the model was completed, verification of the accuracy of the model involved testing it for the ability to reproduce complex input–output phenomena that have been observed in the laboratory. To do this, the T-cell model was simulated under a multitude of cellular conditions and analyzed in terms of input–output dose–response curves to determine whether the model behaves as expected, including various downstream effects as a result of activation of the TCR, G-protein-coupled receptor, cytokine, and integrin pathways.Conroy BD, Herek TA, Shew TD, Latner M, Larson JJ, Allen L, et al.

The model of the roughly 500-gene Mycoplasma genitalium contains 28 algorithmically-independent components incorporating work from over 900 sources. It accounts for interactions of the complete genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of the organism, marking a significant advancement for the field.http://covertlab.stanford.edu/publicationpdfs/mgenitalium_whole_cell_2012_07_20.pdf Most attempts at modeling cell cycle processes have focused on the broad, complicated molecular interactions of many different chemicals, including several cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase molecules as they correspond to the S, M, G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle. In a 2014 published article in PLOS computational biology, collaborators at University of Oxford, Virginia Tech and Institut de Génétique et Développement de Rennes produced a simplified model of the cell cycle using only one cyclin/CDK interaction. This model showed the ability to control totally functional cell division through regulation and manipulation only the one interaction, and even allowed researchers to skip phases through varying the concentration of CDK. This model could help understand how the relatively simple interactions of one chemical translate to a cellular level model of cell division.

He served as mayor of the city of Seattle, Washington and is a neighborhood activist and a former State Chair of the Sierra Club. In what was characterized as a \\"sea change in the power structure of Seattle,\\" McGinn differentiated his campaign by his opposition to the proposed tunnel replacement to the Alaskan Way Viaduct. He won election in November 2009 with the support of groups considered to be \\"political outsiders\\" such as environmentalists, biking advocates, musicians, advocates for the poor, nightclub owners, and younger voters. Early life and education Originally from Long Island, New York, McGinn earned a B.A. in economics from Williams College and worked for Congressman Jim Weaver as a legislative aide. McGinn attended law school at the University of Washington School of Law. After graduating, he practiced business law for the Seattle firm Stokes Lawrence, becoming a partner. He left Stokes Lawrence in 2005 and started Great City Initiative, a non-profit advocacy group. Political activism McGinn is credited with increasing the \\"clout\\" of the Sierra Club, helping transform it into a \\"real political force\\" in Seattle. According to McGinn, the club's political committee was \\"moribund\\" when he volunteered to lead it in the mid-1990s. The group grew to 50 active political leaders by 2009. McGinn is the founder and former executive director of the Seattle Great City Initiative, a non-profit advocacy group, as well as a former head of the Greenwood Community Council. While at Great City, he oversaw a budget of $160,000 and worked alliances with companies like Triad Development, Harbor Properties and Paul Allen's Vulcan Inc. on environmental and urban development issues. As a neighborhood organizer and head of his non-profit, McGinn endorsed his future opponent Mayor Greg Nickels and worked with him to bar development of large, commercial \\"big box stores\\", eliminate street parking in favor of bus lanes and push for changes in zoning laws to encourage greater density in the Greenwood neighborhood. McGinn stepped down from his position as head of the Greenwood Community Council in 2006 and stepped down as executive director of his non-profit in March 2009 in order to run for Mayor. In 2007, McGinn used his position as a leader in the Sierra Club's Cascade Chapter to help successfully campaign against metropolitan Seattle's Proposition 1, a combined road and mass transit measure, in favor of a transit-only measure. He later chaired the successful campaign to pass a Seattle parks levy. McGinn's management record as an activist has come under scrutiny, including his chairmanship of Seattle's successful 2008 parks levy campaign. Brice Maryman, a leader in the parks campaign, said \\"There wouldn't have been a parks levy on the ballot ... without Mike McGinn's leadership\\". However, some members of the Seattle City Council, including Tom Rasmussen, said that McGinn mismanaged the effort. The City Council became \\"alarmed\\" at what members described as a disorganized effort. The City Council appointed Seattle Parks Foundation Executive Director Karen Daubert as co-chair in order to help save the levy campaign. Rasmussen says that it was Daubert who \\"saved the day\\" for the levy. McGinn credited his grassroots style of campaigning for the victory. 2009 Seattle mayoral campaign Mike McGinn at a townhall McGinn announced his candidacy in the 2009 Seattle mayoral election on March 24, 2009. McGinn stated that his principal policy positions would center on schools, broadband Internet access and local transportation infrastructure. He advocated replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct with a surface street instead of the planned tunnel; supplanting private broadband Internet service with a fiber optic system built and operated by Seattle City Light, the city's municipally owned electric utility; greater local neighborhood control of their parking taxes and meter rates. He also raised the possibility of abolishing the city's independent school board, with operation of the schools to become a city government responsibility. Mayor Greg Nickels proposed eliminating Seattle's business tax on Single-occupancy vehicle commuters on the grounds it was no longer needed and was hurting business and job growth. McGinn opposed ending the tax, called the Employee Hours Tax, which taxes business $25 for each of its employees that drive to work alone. McGinn said that Nickels and fellow candidate Joe Mallahan, who also favored repealing the tax, were \\"out of touch\\" and too close to the \\"business elite\\". McGinn rode his electrically assisted bicycle to and from political events and maintained no paid campaign staff. In an upset, aided by exposure in the form of a cover profile from The Stranger, McGinn led the August primary with 39,097 votes, ahead of Mallahan's 37,933 votes and incumbent Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels' 35,781 votes. By October 2009 the McGinn campaign had raised approximately $150,000. In the general election, T-Mobile executive Mallahan was perceived as the \\"insider candidate\\" who was endorsed by Governor Christine Gregoire, a supporter of the tunnel. McGinn defeated Mallahan on November 3, 2009 in a close race, winning 51.14% of the vote. Although the race was so close in the early vote count that a recount was considered a possibility, the gap between the candidates widened as the tally proceeded. Mallahan conceded on November 9, saying of McGinn that \\"he seemed to be the superior campaigner this time around\\" and that McGinn's message \\"seemed to resonate\\" with Seattle's voters. Describing the coalition that backed McGinn, University of Washington political science professor David Olson said, \\"these new actors are legitimate, numerically important and politically very skilled\\". Mallahan criticized McGinn for \\"push polling\\" with robocalls to Seattle residents during the campaign. Mallahan called one surveySeattle (WA) Study Interviews October 5-6, 2009 November 2009 Likely Voters, Constituent Dynamics. Survey transcript on the site of the Seattle Times, accessed online . about the proposed Alaskan Way Viaduct \\"dishonest\\" but McGinn says the poll was legitimate research. Mayor Nickels had used \\"negative\\" robocalls himself against McGinn a few months earlier in the primary campaign. 2013 Seattle mayoral campaign In 2013, McGinn was the incumbent running for re-election. He placed second in a field of nine candidates for the Seattle mayoral primary. Ultimately, McGinn lost the general election with 47% of the votes to Ed Murray's 52% of the votes. 2017 Seattle mayoral campaign On April 17, 2017, McGinn announced his candidacy in the 2017 mayoral election, looking to unseat the incumbent Murray. Policy positions Taxes and budget In 2010, McGinn asked for a higher car tab tax and a mandatory doubling of the parking lot tax, a $241 million levy to replace the city's seawall two years early and almost doubling the city's education levy to $231 million. McGinn's budget included a mandatory, city directed increase in parking fees in several neighborhoods to $4 an hour, increases which were expected to return an estimated $20 million in revenue for the city. He allocated a $13 million funding increase for bicycle and pedestrian projects derived from new taxes on motorists. At the same time, he sought reduced funding in road maintenance and widespread cuts in basics such as police and library services. His increased funding of pedestrian and bicycle projects during a time of general cuts raised criticism of his budgetary priorities. In all McGinn's budget slashed $67 million from various areas by laying off 300 employees, reducing hours at community centers, cutting park maintenance, raising fees, and reducing the wages of union workers. For 2012, McGinn proposed deferring some maintenance on roads and buildings and across the board cuts into the 2012 fiscal year, alerting police, fire and human-services departments to prepare for three to six percent cuts and all other departments for four to eight percent cuts, in order to close a $17 million funding gap. In other areas McGinn proposed funding increases. Responding to a letter from Seattle Gay News, and at the recommendation of the city government's Seattle Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Commission, McGinn said he will \\"work to improve\\" city health benefits packages up for renewal in 2013 so that the city will be able to pay for transgender employees' mental health care, steroid treatments and sex change operations. Citing opinions by the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association, the Commission called the treatments \\"a medical necessity\\" and McGinn responded that the issue is more about fairness than costs. McGinn also created a new position at city hall for a former Cascade Bicycle Club lobbyist at $95,000 a year after giving a $21,000 raise to his new communications director, bringing that yearly salary to $120,000. The creation of the new position generated controversy as it coincided with across the board budget cuts for other departments. Education After winning election, McGinn forwarded an expanded education levy which would raise $115 million in additional taxes for the Seattle Public School District. McGinn asserts that the doubling of the levy is necessary to get additional money to programs serving low-income and minority families. The levy would also expand early education and kindergartens, extra elementary school programs for high poverty areas, support for struggling students transitioning from middle to high school, and academic, career and college planning for at risk high school students. The Seattle Times characterized the size of the tax hike to be \\"tone deaf\\" to the economic realities of voters. Acknowledging the size of the levy as a concern the Seattle City Council still voted unanimously to forward the mayor's levy proposal to voters with Tim Burgess, the Council's lead on the levy, saying its size \\"matched the needs\\" of Seattle's children. The levy was approved by voters in the 2011 general election. McGinn and the school district launched a program to improve school attendance in Seattle Public Schools called \\"Be There Get Here\\" in 2011. The idea behind the program is to improve academic performance by improving attendance, based on data showing that students with fewer absences graduate at a notably higher rate. Incentives are offered to students, such as entering them in a raffle if they keep absences to less than five. Six months into the program absences were reduced by 50%, the lowest rate in five years. Marijuana McGinn supports the legalization and taxation of marijuana, saying on KUOW-FM, \\"We recognize that, you know, like alcohol, it's something that should be regulated, not treated as a criminal activity. And I think that's where the citizens of Seattle want us to go.\\" He believes marijuana can be used as a cash crop to offset the city's financial problems. McGinn called for an executive review of Seattle's law enforcement policy in regard to marijuana after a police raid on a medical marijuana user who was growing plants in his home. He has said that he believes the country is in a time of transition in regard to marijuana policy citing California as a \\"social bellwether\\". In July 2011, McGinn signed a Seattle-specific medical marijuana bill similar to one vetoed by former Washington Governor Christine Gregoire. The bill allows for the licensing of marijuana dispensaries within Seattle. Transportation McGinn at the ribbon cutting for the Ballard Neighborhood Greenway, a bicycle boulevard. McGinn is a proponent of reducing car ridership and increasing bicycling, walking, and public transportation. McGinn has proposed raising taxes on car transportation. He has been described in a critical editorial as \\"philosophically anti-car\\". McGinn described the idea of a war on cars as \\"silly\\" and stated his transportation policy is focused on reducing the number of cars in Seattle and expanding biking, walking and public transit. Since his time as a neighborhood activist in Greenwood, to his current position as Mayor, McGinn has pushed for the removal of car lanes and on-street parking around the city in favor of bus and bike lanes. McGinn also supports the reduction of lanes dedicated to vehicular traffic within the city through \\"road diets\\". These programs convert four lanes of traffic into two lanes, using the added space from lane reductions for the inclusion of bike lanes and a center turn lane. Some of these programs have been well received as improving safety for bicyclists and lowering vehicle speeds while others have been opposed as hurting local business and being inappropriate for arterial routes. McGinn opposes the currently planned replacement of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge that connects Seattle to Bellevue and Redmond. McGinn is trying to stop the plan, which calls for six lanes instead of the current four, citing his opposition to building new roads. McGinn opposes adding any traffic capacity and has stated his desire to see the additional capacity planned now instead be used as transit only lanes. He also supports tolling on the bridge in order to further diminish car usage. McGinn advocates expanding light rail in Seattle calling for a public vote in 2011 to raise taxes for a new light rail line for the western side of the city, including Ballard, Interbay, Queen Anne, Belltown, Downtown, West Seattle, and possibly Fremont. Proposed tunnel Alaskan Way Viaduct During his campaign for mayor, McGinn said that the deep bore tunnel replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct was \\"a huge waste of money that's completely indefensible.\\" McGinn's opposition to the tunnel received criticism from groups like the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce, the downtown business community, the King County Labor Council and the Seattle Times which, in an editorial critical of both candidates, called McGinn's surface street plan \\"impractical\\" and claimed it would clog downtown and overwhelm nearby Interstate 5. Down in the polls during the final days of the campaign, McGinn, although reiterating his opposition to the tunnel, promised that as mayor he would honor the then- recent unanimous City Council vote to move forward with the project.. After the election, state employee emails revealed a discomfort with the McGinn campaign by state government and transportation officials over McGinn's opposition to the tunnel. Ron Judd, an aide to Washington Governor Chris Gregoire, sent emails to staff and DOT officials saying McGinn's position was \\"BS\\" and accused McGinn of stoking populist angers and relying on voter's ignorance about funding details to advance opposition to the tunnel. Washington State Transportation Secretary Paula Hammond described McGinn's budget forecasting as \\"wild accusations\\" as she monitored a campaign debate on her Blackberry, and in a response to questions raising concerns about her involvement in opposing the McGinn campaign said \\"I can't stand it when politicians make things up in order to win an election. When people do that, I think it's our responsibility to clear the record. That's my motivation.\\" State officials were criticized for supporting Mallahan and opposing McGinn, and also for releasing a video of a 2007 computer animation showing collapse of the Alaskan Way Viaduct in a hypothetical earthquake just nine days before the election. Since taking office McGinn has repeatedly made efforts to stop construction of the tunnel. Citing potential cost overruns McGinn has proposed a surface street replacement of the viaduct and the reduction of cars on that portion of the Washington State Route 99 corridor from 105,000 to 50,000 per weekday. McGinn states that the lost traffic capacity could be offset by diverting more cars to Interstate 5, increased transit use, walking, biking and drivers staying home. Writing in The Stranger in June 2010 during negotiations on a master contract with the state, McGinn stated, \\"Ninety percent of megaprojects have cost overruns… Seattle has to pay overruns, but has no say over the project…[b]ecause the tunnel is a state-controlled project, and the state maintains all decision-making authority over it… Cost overruns could lead to severe cuts to basic services.\\". The title of the article and the co-attribution to Conlin are satirical: Conlin, by The Stranger's account in the article, \\"refused to debate tunnel cost overruns\\" in any of several forums, including The Stranger. In February 2011, when the Seattle City Council voted 8-1 to sign an agreement allowing the tunnel project to proceed, McGinn vetoed the ordinance.. The City Council then overrode his veto, again 8-1.. After the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in Japan McGinn, citing the quake, called for the viaduct to be pulled down a year early. No plan to replace or mitigate the lost traffic capacity was put forward. The call is opposed by some businesses and transportation experts. The president of Ballard's North Seattle Industrial Association called the likely fallout of early closure \\"a horror show\\" citing the corridor's role as the primary arterial for workers, equipment and supplies between manufacturers along Seattle's two key manufacturing zones, the Duwamish Waterway and along the Lake Washington Ship Canal. Washington's State's Department of Transportation viaduct program administrator also opposed the idea saying, \\"To simply close the viaduct without a reasonable replacement in place would be very damaging to the city of Seattle economically. To start over now and pursue a new alternative would delay the overall project schedule. The viaduct is just as vulnerable as it was before the earthquake in Japan.\\" After having his veto on the tunnel overridden McGinn called for a referendum challenging the tunnel. Two of his staff members took temporary leaves of absence to work on the anti-tunnel campaign and McGinn and his wife both donated money; Councilmember Sally Clark's aide took a leave of absence to run the pro-tunnel campaign. He called for others to support the measure and donate money. After the campaign turned in 29,000 signatures, Washington State Transportation Secretary Paula Hammond said that delays and court costs associated with the referendum will cost the city $54 million and Ron Paananen, the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement project administrator, said should it succeed it would cost the city over $1 billion. Fellow tunnel opponent City Councilman Mike O'Brien said that, when looked at a different way, cancelling the tunnel would save the city $700 million. The resulting referendum, on which a yes-vote was effectively pro-tunnel, was approved by approximately 60 percent of Seattle voters.. Social welfare and public safety McGinn at a 4th of July ceremony with Representative Jim McDermott and U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell As both a candidate and a mayor, McGinn supported his predecessor's attempts to ban all guns from parks and other public places. After the King County Superior Court overturned the gun ban, for being in violation of state law, McGinn petitioned for the state legislature to change the law. After a series of controversial police actions McGinn laid out in his State of the City address that there was \\"no place\\" for police officers in Seattle who did not share city officials' commitment to racial and social justice. News reports said that a Seattle Police Officer's Guild spokesperson thought \\"it's scary that the mayor is trying to influence how officers perceive things\\". Later, in the aftermath of the shooting of a transient woodcarver John T. Williams by a Seattle police officer, McGinn declared February 27 to be \\"John T. Williams Day.\\" The declaration was met with a variety of reactions from activists, the media and community groups. Some media figures and police officers complained that honoring a man with a lengthy criminal record who had been recorded threatening the lives of police officers was inappropriate and others claimed the declaration was political pandering designed to distract from perceived failures in his leadership. Conversely many members of the community and the Williams family expressed gratitude and John Diaz, Seattle Chief of Police, declared the invitation to the event to be \\"an honor.\\" In his first two years as mayor, McGinn spearheaded a new program in the Seattle Police Department to expand foot patrols around entertainment venues and nightlife hot spots during the summer, predominantly in the Belltown neighborhood. The program came in response to several early morning shootings outside bars and nightclubs. The emphasis of the program is to preempt crime in the area on evenings and weekends. Additional neighborhoods targeted for increased patrols are Alki beach and the Greek Row around the University of Washington. McGinn and an advisory panel of advocates for the homeless that he appointed, have called for the creation of a \\"long term\\" housing facility for the homeless on city land. The panel forwarded seven different locations for the mayor's consideration. After initially choosing a site in the Georgetown neighborhood McGinn elected to have the old Fire Station 39 in Lake City act as the site for a period of four to six months. In March 2011 the City Council rejected McGinn's plan for the permanent facility in Georgetown citing the mayor's failure to secure the environmental review required by state law in order to make the necessary zoning changes. McGinn's criticized the Council and tried to draw a parallel to the Council's decision on the Alaskan Way Viaduct Tunnel project, saying \\"They approved agreements with the state (for the tunnel) even though the environmental review is far from complete\\". The homeless facility is expected to cost approximately a half million dollars a year. McGinn vetoed a ban on aggressive panhandling which was passed by a 5-4 vote of the Seattle city council. Supporters said that the law was designed to cut down on aggressive panhandlers using intimidating language and gestures, begging at ATMs, repeatedly soliciting people who have already said \\"no\\" or blocking people's path while soliciting money. He cited concerns about free speech rights, the panhandlers not having access to lawyers, and that the bill could compel people into mental health and drug treatment programs instead of what he called the \\"normal civil commitment process.\\" In a \\"stunning display\\" of the clout of McGinn and his political allies to stop a measure that was widely expected to be implemented, the city council failed to override his veto of the panhandling law. Relations with organized labor In his campaign for mayor, McGinn received the endorsements of several unions, including IBEW Local 77, SEIU Local 925, and UFCW Local 21. However, the King County Labor Council endorsed McGinn's opponent, Joe Mallahan, mainly because of McGinn's opposition to the tunnel to replace the viaduct, described by unions as a \\"deal breaker\\" that would cause the city and its unions to lose jobs and billions of dollars from the State of Washington and Federal government. The tunnel would have been partially funded by city, state, and federal governments, bringing federal money into the state and supporting the building industry. Seattle Firefighters Union Local 27 and the Seattle Police Officers Guild (SPOG) also endorsed Mallahan. SPOG President Sgt. Rich O'Neill went on record at a news conference to criticize McGinn's lack of an adequate policy position regarding public safety. McGinn's prescriptions in 2010 for the city budget shortfall included additional furloughing of city employees, and were opposed by local public employee unions.Erica C. Barnett, City Unions Reject Proposal to Furlough Workers, Eliminate 2011 Pay Increase, Publicola, . Accessed online . Public approval In February 2010, two months after his election, McGinn's job approval was polled by SurveyUSA at 40% approve, 34% disapprove, and 27% unsure. By July, in a KING 5 poll, his approval was 45%, disapproving 38%, and 17% unsure. In March 2011, a poll by Elway Research reported public opinion of his performance as 4% excellent, 28% good, 39% fair, 27% poor, and 6% no opinion. A poll published by EMC Research in June 2011 showed a job approval rating of 33% and a disapproval rating of 65% in March. The same poll conducted in June showed a job approval of 23% and a disapproval of 73%. A SurveyUSA poll released on February 21, 2012, showed 33% approve, 50% disapprove, and 18% unsure.

Bach-y-Rita was one of the first to seriously study the idea of neuroplasticity (although it was first proposed in the late 19th century), and to introduce sensory substitution as a tool to treat patients suffering from neurological disorders. Bach-y-Rita is known as \\"the father of sensory substitution\\". Biography Bach-y-Rita was born on April 4, 1934, in New York City to Anne Hyman and Pedro Bach-y-Rita, the latter a Catalan poet and teacher at City College of New York. He studied at the Bronx High School of Science, from which he graduated at the age of fifteen before studying at Mexico City College (now the University of the Americas in Puebla). After his early education, he studied medicine at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM). He initially dropped out, going through several varied jobs, but later returned to finish his degree.Remembering Leaders in the Field of Blindness and Visual Impairment: Dr. Paul Bach-y-Rita Obituary, retrieved 4th October 2009. After completing his degree, Bach-y-Rita worked for a short time as a physician in the village of Tilzapotla in Morelos, Mexico, before working for ten years at the Smith-Kettlewell Institute of Visual Sciences in San Francisco, becoming a professor at the age of 37.Paul Bach-y-RitaProfessor, Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, and Biomedical Engineering University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI retrieved 4th October 2009 He joined the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1983 and became a professor at UW Medical school, Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation Medicine and the UW–Madison Engineering School, Department of Biomedical Engineering, while working at other organisations around the world. Bach-y-Rita died at his home on November 20, 2006.Salus University: Obituary Work in Sensory Substitution and Neuroplasticity Bach-y-Rita's most notable work was in the field of neuroplasticity. He is seen as the first to propose the concept of sensory substitution to treat patients with disabilities, often those caused by neurological problems. One of the first applications of sensory substitution he created was a chair which allowed blind people to 'see'. The trials he conducted in 1969 are now regarded to be the first form of experimental evidence for neuroplasticity and the feasibility of sensory substitution.Guardian Science Weekly 20/04/2009 Later in his career, Bach-y- Rita created a device which enabled patients with damaged vestibular nuclei to regain their ability to remain balanced, by using an electrical stimulator placed on the tongue which reacted to a motion sensor affixed to the patient. This application enabled patients to remain balanced without the equipment after several weeks use.\\"BrainPort balance device\\" How Stuff Works retrieved 3rd October 2009 Early research in Neuroscience The chair he used had a bank of four hundred vibrating plates resting against the blind user's back, and vibrating in connection with a camera placed above the chair, looking forwards. The pattern in which the stimulation occurred enabled the user to \\"see\\", often being able to recognise an object coming towards the camera. Bach-y-Rita suggested this was an example of neuroplasticity, as he believed the signals sent to the brain from the skin via touch were being processed in the visual cortex, because of the way the patients interpreted the information. Using Neuroplasticity to treat balance disorders One of his last applications of neuroplasticity was to treat patients with damaged vestibular systems, meaning they were unable to remain balanced. The device he created (now sold as Brainport) consists of a group of accelerometers positioned on the patient and linked to a computer. The information is processed and fed to a small plate which is positioned on the patient's tongue (used because of the high density of sensory receptors). The device stimulates different areas of the tongue, depending on the orientation of the accelerometers. This stimulation enables the patient to stay balanced. However, after repeated use, Bach-y-Rita discovered that the patient remained balanced for a short time after using the device. After using the device for several weeks, the patient was completely cured, demonstrating another application of neuroplasticity in treating neurological disorders, and also the ability of the brain to adapt to repeated stimuli.BrainPort, Dr. Paul Bach-y-Rita, and Sensory Substitution Wed, March 30, 2005 retrieved 3rd October 2009 Also created was a similar device that enables a patient to see by way of a camera attaching to his or her head and feeding information to the tongue. Research into neuroplasticity to treat stroke victims In 1959, Bach-y-Rita's father, Pedro, suffered a cerebral infarction (stroke) which caused paralysis to one side of his body and damaged his ability to speak. George Bach-y-Rita—a psychiatrist and Paul's brother—succeeded in treating Pedro so that he was able to lead a normal life, despite the opinion of several doctors that this was impossible. When Pedro died, an autopsy, performed by Dr. Mary Jane Aguilar revealed that Paul's father Pedro had suffered a major stroke and suffered severe damage to a large portion of his brain stem, which had not repaired itself after the stroke. The fact that he had made such a significant recovery suggested that his brain had reorganized itself, providing evidence for neuroplasticity.

Activities Guided imagery To relax and encourage sleep, a meditation in the form of guided imagery may be used. The stereotypical method is by counting sheep, imagining sheep jumping over a fence, while counting them. In most depictions of the activity, the person envisions an endless series of identical white sheep jumping over a fence, while counting the number that do so. The idea, presumably, is to induce boredom while occupying the mind with something simple, repetitive, and rhythmic, all of which are known to help humans sleep. It may also simulate REM sleep, tiring people's eyes. According to a BBC experiment conducted by researchers at Oxford University, counting sheep is actually an inferior means of inducing sleep. Hot bath TubThe daily sleep/wake cycle is linked to the daily body temperature cycle. For this reason, a hot bath which raises the core body temperature has been found to improve the duration and quality of sleep. A 30-minute soak in a bath of – which raises the core body temperature by one degree – is suitable for this purpose. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 different studies found that taking a warm bath or shower 1-2 hours before bedtime for as little as 10 minutes shortens the sleep onset time and improves sleep efficiency and subjective sleep quality and increases the amount of deep sleep . Sex Sexual intercourse, and specifically orgasm, may have an effect on the ability to fall asleep for some people. The period after orgasm (known as a refractory period) is often a time of increased relaxation, attributed to the release of the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin. Yawning Yawning is commonly associated with imminent sleep, but it seems to be a measure to maintain arousal when sleepy and so prevents sleep rather than inducing it. Yawning may be a cue that the body is tired and ready for sleep, but deliberate attempts to yawn may have the opposite effect of sleep induction. Sleeping pills Sleeping pills utilizing diphenhydramine Hypnotics, sometimes referred to as sleeping pills, may be prescribed by a physician, but their long-term efficacy is poor and they have numerous adverse effects including daytime drowsiness, accidents, memory disorders and withdrawal symptoms. If they are to be taken, the preferred choices are benzodiazepines with short-lasting effects such as temazepam or the newer Z-medicines such as zopiclone. Alternatively, in isolated cases sedatives such as barbiturates may be prescribed. Nonprescription medications A number of nonprescription medications have shown to be effective in promoting sleep. The amino acid tryptophan and its related compounds 5-HTP and melatonin, have common use, with the prescription medication ramelteon operating on the same biochemical pathway. The herb valerian can also be effective in gently inducing a relaxed state which is conducive to sleep. Food and drink An urban legend states that certain foods such as turkey and bananas are rich in tryptophan and thus assist sleep, although this has not been confirmed by research. Alcohol An alcoholic drink or nightcap is a long-standing folk method which will induce sleep, as alcohol is a sedative. However, when the alcohol blood level subsides, there is a rebound effect: the person becomes more alert and so tends to wake up too soon. Also, if they continue to sleep, REM sleep is promoted, and this may cause vivid nightmares which can reduce the quality of the sleep. Warm milk Milk being warmed on a stoveA cup of warm milk or a milk-based drink is traditionally used for sleep induction. Hot chocolate is also a traditional bedtime drink but this contains high levels of xanthines (caffeine and theobromine), which are stimulants and therefore may be counterproductive. Also, a pinch of turmeric powder with warm milk reduces stress and induces sleep. The flavor of the milk can be improved by adding honey and/or vanilla.Green, Wendy.

Originally built as a defensive fortification on high-ground outside the city walls, the city eventually grew around the fort, and it took on various other roles – including use as a military barracks, prison, and police station. Since 2014, the fort has seen some development as a tourism heritage site, reportedly attracting 36,000 visitors during 2015. The walls of the fort have been accessible to the public on a regular basis since September 2014. History Elizabeth Fort was first built in 1601 on a hill to the south and outside the medieval walls of Cork. This position was chosen because, while the city had relied on Shandon Castle and the city walls for defence since Anglo-Norman times, the development of artillery and the possibility of its deployment on the hills surrounding the city, diminished the potential effectiveness of these defences. The fort was built by Sir George Carew and named after Queen Elizabeth I. This original fort was built of timber and earth, and within a few years was pulled down by the citizens of Cork. Fearing that the fort might be used against them by James I during the Tudor conquest of Ireland, the mayor and people of Cork demolished the fort in 1603. Cork was retaken however by Lord Mountjoy and the fort was rebuilt. This early construction took place on the site of an existing church. This Hiberno- Norman-period church dated from at least the High Middle Ages and appears in documents and maps as \\"St Mary del Nard\\" (1199), or \\"Holy Cross del Nard\\" (1311).\\"Rood\\", \\"Roe\\", and \\"Cross\\" in these names are synonymous. Bradley et al. contend that \\"Nard\\" is a corruption of the Irish \\"An Ard\\" meaning \\"height\\" – referring to the site's hill-top position. Windele, Gibson and others describe the church as dedicated to \\"Mary of the Spikenard\\" (Mary of Bethany or Mary Magdalene) who anointed the feet of Jesus with spicknard/spikenard/(ointment). In John Speed's map of Cork (1610) \\"Holy Roe\\" church is marked within the walls of the (then) newly finished fort. A northern wall of Elizabeth Fort on high-ground over residential city streets The basic structure of the current fort has its basis in reconstructions dating from 1624 to 1626, and in works reputedly carried out under Cromwell in 1649. Any remnants of the previous church were removed in these reconstructions. In 1690, during the Williamite War in Ireland, Cork was a Jacobite stronghold, and while Elizabeth Fort held out for some time during the siege of Cork, artillery was brought to bear on the eastern walls of the city from a vantage point at Red Abbey. The walls were breached and the city capitulated within four days. In the decades following the siege, the fort ceased to operate as a defensive structure for the city, and in 1719 was put to use as a barracks. In 1817, it was re-purposed again – this time as a prison, with many prisoners being held at the fort prior to \\"penal transportation\\" to New South Wales and other British colonies. It was mostly female prisoners held within the fort from 1822 onwards. The fort remained in use as a convict depot until 1837. In the late 19th century, the fort reverted to military use and became a station of the Cork City Artillery. During the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), Elizabeth Fort was used as a base by the \\"Black and Tans\\", but was relinquished by the British following the Anglo- Irish Treaty. During the succeeding Irish Civil War the fort was burned by anti-treaty forces in August 1922. The remaining interior structures of the fort date from a rebuild following this fire. Though briefly housing an air- raid shelter during \\"The Emergency\\" (1939–1945), the rebuilt interior buildings from the 1920s continued in use as a Garda (police) station until 2013. Following the closure of the Garda station buildings, the site came under the management of Cork City Council having previously been in the care of the Office of Public Works. Tourism Reenactment display within the fort As an continually active military and police barracks for more than 400 years, Elizabeth Fort had not been open for tourism or heritage development. However, local interest groups and site stakeholders (namely the Gardaí, Cork City Council and Office of Public Works) had facilitated the development of the ramparts – which were partly opened to access by tourists on a seasonal basis. Markets and festivals were also occasionally held in the fort. Since the closure of the Garda station and other offices on the site, local historical interest groups and councillors had advocated the further and permanent development of the site for tourism. In January 2014 the site was fully and formally passed to the control of Cork City Council to facilitate this development under a three-year plan. Since 2014, Elizabeth Fort has been a venue for a number of events and festivals, including the Cork Midsummer Festival, Cork Heritage Open Day, Heritage Week, Culture Night, Cork Photo 2015 and 2016, the Cork Saint Patrick's Festival and the 2015 Fin Barre's Festival. While plans were prepared for additional development (including an \\"interpretive centre\\"), as of late 2016, funding had not been allocated for these works. In 2018 the Irish Landmark Trust re-developed and re-purposed two of the interior buildings for use as short-let tourist accommodation. The walls and certain interior spaces of the fort are open to the public six days a week; Tuesday to Saturday 10:00 to 17:00 and Sunday 12:00 to 17:00, with free admission.

He was also known as Dharma Gurung. He became famous as Dhanu Guru in 18th century Nepal when people realized his extraordinary mastership in archery; he later was called Guru Baaje for his profound wisdom on the dharma when he moved to Kalabang (Kaloban/Black Forest) Gareti, Pumdibhumdi, Nepal. At this time that a program of archery was held in Nuwakot by the king of Nuwakot. In this program Dharma Gurung, representing Kaski state, and Malla Thakuri of Baglung, representing Parbat, were called for the well-known mastership of their archery. Dharmu Gurung and Malla Thakuri reached the final. Malla Thakuri took the first attempt, and he broke the thread in the sky. Dharma Gurung he said it's meaningless to hit a thread of such easiness. When the king asked what type of thread he likes to hit, he said, looking to the mirror in front, 'I want to hit the thread in the sky behind.' In this way he hit the thread into two. When he was back home, the king of Kaski state asked him to ask for any boon. He asked for the Kaaloban (Black Forest) (called Kalabang by Gurungs) to be granted where he could build his commune of lineage and practice dharma at its highest level. He was a master of pye tan lyu tan and a guru of many siddha vidhyas. People used to come to him for treatment from far and wide and to learn about dharma and secret tantra vidyas. People called him Guru Baaje for his profound encyclopedic wisdom. When Guru Baaje realized time was going to have its way, he called all. Mainly pointing to Karnu Gurung he said: > “Ours is a tradition of Guru and we hold the light of Gurus hence we are > called Gurungs. From 1 to 9 it is a whole number, I am the first of this > generation and by the time of 9th generation it will be complete as 9 is a > last number. Then in the 10th generation there will be born a master guru > himself, an Adiguru incarnate who will transcend all dharmas and gurus, his > name will start with A. And as 10 represents eternity he will not be Kshina > but will be Aadi and Anadi. A master guru a siddhabuddha will he be to save > many a life and simply but incredibly will he use his methods.” After this he said syai syai and moved to the north never to be back.

He attended high school in Tolmin and Gorizia. In the late 1920s, when his native region was part of Italy, Kosmač joined the militant anti-fascist organization TIGR. In 1930, he was arrested by the Italian Fascist authorities, but released the next year. He fled to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and settled in Ljubljana. In 1938, he was granted a scholarship by the French government, and he moved to Paris, where he worked for the Yugoslav embassy. In 1940, he fled to London, where he worked at the BBC World Service. In 1943, he went to Cairo, and in 1944 to Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia, where he joined the Yugoslav partisan resistance. After World War II, he worked as a reporter and a screenplayer for the emerging Slovenian film production industry. Among other, he wrote the screenplay for the film On Our Own Land. In 1956, he settled in the coastal resort town of Portorož, where he spent the rest of his life. In 1961, he became a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He died in Ljubljana, and was buried in his native village. In 1980, he was posthumously granted the Prešeren Award, the highest award for artistic achievement in Slovenia.  Work  Kosmač is renowned mostly for his short stories, which are frequently praised for their subtle psychological depth. He started writing in the late 1930s, publishing short stories in the literary journal Sodobnost, edited by the literary critic Josip Vidmar. His early works show an affinity to other contemporary Slovene authors who embraced a style known as social realism: Prežihov Voranc, Miško Kranjec, Anton Ingolič, Tone Seliškar, Mile Klopčič, Bratko Kreft, Ivan Potrč and others. After World War II, he gradually turned away from social realism, and was among the first Slovene authors to include modernist features in his prose, especially surrealism. His later prose, which he is most renowned for, has frequently been considered a type of magical realism.

Plot A young couple Aki and Kazuo are snatched off the street while having their first date. They wake up shackled in a basement that has plastic-covered walls. With no further explanation, a sadistic madman degrades, tortures and mutilates them. He punctures Kazuo's belly with a screwdriver and slices his tongue, drives nails into his scrotum, then sexually assaults the girl, forcing the other to watch. Sometimes, he stops the torture to provide medical assistance and cure the couple's wounds, so they can continue alive for a long period of time. He cuts off all their fingers, makes collars with them, pops out Kazuo's right eye, removes the girl's nipples, and cuts off her right arm. As the torture progresses, it is revealed he is simply doing it for sexual stimulation. He finally castrates Kazuo, claiming he has found all the sexual relief he needs so no longer needs the couple's \\"services\\". The couple is moved to a room that resembles a modern and clean hospital room, where the kidnapper takes care of their wounds. It gradually becomes apparent that the man has professional medical training, refined manners, and fine taste, preferring classical music, good wine, and expensive clothes. He mentions he is wealthy, suggesting he may be a reputable surgeon, not merely a violent sadist, looking for an extreme way to obtain satisfaction in his lonely life. The couple notes the doctor has a particular rotting smell always present behind his clean and elegant appearance. After several days healing, the \\"doctor\\" simply tells the couple they will be free to go, he will turn himself in, and, as apology for all the suffering he inflicted, he will give them his entire fortune as compensation. In a moment alone, Aki and Kazuo promise to support each other once they leave and stay together. However, immediately after telling them they will be released, the couple is taken back to the basement and are shackled again, just like before. The \\"doctor\\" announces they must participate in one final test of love. He pulls out some of Kazuo's intestines and attaches them to a hook. If Kazuo is able to cross the room to the other side (pulling his entire intestine out of his body in the process), and cut Aki's ropes with scissors to release her, both will be freed. However, Kazuo fails due to blood loss and it is revealed that the ropes restraining Aki have a metal wire running through them; the task was therefore impossible regardless). Aki begins to insult the doctor, saying he has a skunk odor. Angered, the doctor cuts off her head. The head lands on the doctor's neck; she bites him with her final breath. Kazuo, not dead yet, stabs him in the foot with the scissors as his supreme last action. The couple dies facing each other. In the epilogue, the madman is revealed to have survived, although he cannot walk properly. He respectfully buries the couple next to each other in a quiet forest the traditional Japanese way, leaving the scissors on their tombs as a symbol. The next scene shows him in his car again, covering himself with lots of perfume to hide his skunk stench. A girl walks by, and the screen cuts as he goes after his next victim. Cast * Tsugumi Nagasawa as Aki * Hiroaki Kawatsure as Kazuo * Shigeo Ōsako as the unnamed doctor Release The British Board of Film Classification has refused to issue an 18 certificate to the unrated version of the film, banning its release in the United Kingdom. BBFC director David Cook explained \\"Unlike other recent 'torture' themed horror works, such as the Saw and Hostel series, Grotesque features minimal narrative or character development and presents the audience with little more than an unrelenting and escalating scenario of humiliation, brutality and sadism. In spite of a vestigial attempt to 'explain' the killer's motivations at the very end of the film, the chief pleasure on offer is not related to understanding the motivations of any of the central characters. Rather, the chief pleasure on offer seems to be wallowing in the spectacle of sadism (including sexual sadism) for its own sake\\". The film's director and screenwriter, Koji Shiraishi, responded that he was \\"delighted and flattered by this most expected reaction from the faraway country, since the film is an honest conscientious work, made sure to upset the so-called moralists.\\" Home media The reception in Japan was initially less controversial, but after the notoriety of the UK ban, Amazon Japan decided to remove the DVD of Grotesque from its website. Of note is that CDJapan, the international version of the Japanese retailer Neowing, does not sell the DVD since the controversy; although it is still readily available to Japanese residents via Neowing. The film was released on DVD in Austria and the Netherlands on July 31. The DVD is a special edition limited to 1,000 copies. The DVD only contains German and Japanese language tracks and is only available in online stores related to the genre. The film was released on a DVD/Blu-ray in the United States by Media Blasters on October 12, 2010.https://www.amazon.com/Grotesque-Blu-ray-Combo-Tsugumi- Nagasawa/dp/B003VL3UP2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1322511296&sr;=8-1  Reception  Derek Elley of Variety had a lukewarm response to Grotesque, offering kudos to aspects such as the acting and the production values, while criticizing others such as the inconsistent special effects, and opining that the \\"ridiculous\\" finale \\"blows any built-up tension and generates chuckles more than anything else\\". Horror News praised the film, opening its review with, \\"Grotesque is really a mix of emotions. Brilliant, disgusting, well written, sadistic and painful to your senses beyond belief\\" and concluding that it was \\"a solid effort\\" that deserves \\"an A for a great and outrageous ending\\".

Description and history Construction of the house began in about 1851, with a one-and-a-half-story cottage, built by the Greene family. Martin Van Heuval built a much larger two-and-a-half-story Late Victorian structure in 1903, incorporating the earlier house into the main block as a wing. The house was remodeled again in 1910 by William Syson. The house was sold to Regina DeMouy Rapier in 1919, after the DeMouy house was destroyed in a fire. Many of her DeMouy, Rapier, and Marston relatives lived in the house during this period. The house gained its name in the early twentieth century from an incident involving the Marston sisters, Adelaide and Eleanor. Family tradition maintains that one evening the children were sitting on a porch rail, and when they got up the rail disintegrated before their eyes. It was discovered that the porch had been infested with termites, from which it acquired its common name. It became locally renowned as a literary gathering place during the tenancy of Adelaide Caroline Marston Trigg. In 1941, she co-founded Mobile's The Haunted Book Shop. The bookstore became a literary fixture that attracted the likes of Harper Lee, Thomas Mann, Eugene Walter and William March. Several years after selling her interest in The Haunted Book Shop, she operated Far Corners Book Search out of the house. Adelaide and sister Eleanor were close friends with Eugene Walter. He was renowned as an author, poet, gourmet chef, translator, and friend of Federico Fellini. Walter lived with them on several occasions and featured the house in his 1982 cookbook, Delectable Dishes From Termite Hall. Adelaide Trigg died in 2008 at the age of 89. The novel, In the Hope of Rising Again, was written by Trigg's granddaughter, Helen Scully, and is set in the house. The house has remained in the Marston-Trigg family. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 11, 1983, due to its architectural significance.

Its coverage includes independent travel, outdoor exploration and recreation, geography, wildlife, conservation, people, science and natural phenomena, First Nations culture, heritage places, and history within the province, with a tradition of extensive use of photography. Founded in 1959 as Beautiful British Columbia magazine, the publication is currently owned by OP Media Group.  History  In 1959, founding editor Clyde Harrington pitched the idea of an all-colour British Columbia travel publication to the B.C. provincial government. The first issue, titled Beautiful British Columbia: Land of New Horizons, appeared that year, at a time when B.C. was little known outside of Canada. The fledgling magazine used full-colour, large-format layout and high photographic content, techniques that were relatively uncommon at the time. The cover line on the summer 1959 launch issue proclaimed \\"48 pages of sparkling colour\\". Beautiful British Columbia Magazine used the new colour palette to celebrate B.C.'s diverse, spectacular scenery in pictures and stories. The magazine reflected a new era of boundless optimism and expansionism in the province, heralding major new highway construction and the launch of a government-run ferry fleet (BC Ferries) that would transform travel within B.C. In the early 1960s, sales increased dramatically as residents began to send Beautiful British Columbia Magazine subscriptions to friends and relatives across Canada and around the world. The quarterly magazine, now incorporating an annual scenic calendar, soon developed one of the largest circulations in Canada according to the national Print Measurement Bureau (PMB). Over the next 20 years, the magazine played a major role in the development of today's multibillion-dollar tourism industry, putting B.C. on the map as one of the world's great destinations. During this period, with a field almost to itself, the magazine published many B.C. gift and travel books. In 1983, as part of a provincial government privatization program, the magazine was sold to the Jim Pattison Group. The now-independent magazine evolved from a tourism publication into an environmentally conscious geographic and travel quarterly. A new title, Beautiful British Columbia: Ours to Cherish, mirrored the new editorial mandate, and the magazine began to win the first of dozens of regional and international awards for its articles, design, photography, and printing quality. In 2001, Tourism British Columbia acquired the magazine from the Jim Pattison Group. With the Fall 2002 issue, the magazine's title was changed to British Columbia Magazine. The publication continues to win editorial awards and has a paid circulation of more than 120,000, holding its place as one of the largest paid circulation magazines in Canada.British Columbia Magazine official website In 2014, British Columbia Magazine was acquired by OP Media Group.

The temple is dedicated to the Hindu, elephant-headed god of wisdom Ganesha. Titwala is believed to be the putative site of the hermitage of sage Kanva, foster parent of Shakuntala who was born here. The place is steeped in ancient legend and the temple is frequented by a very large number of devotees on account of the belief that separated married couples could be united and marriages of desired people could be fixed easily if the Ganesha image installed in the temple is worshipped with devotion.This temple is frequented mostly on Tuesdays. Legend Shakuntala, with her friends. Painting by Raja Ravi Varma According to legend, this village was part of Dandakaranya forest where the Katkari tribe lived (the tribal hamlets are located even now close to the town across the Kalu river, approached only by boats). Sage Kanva had his hermitage here. Kanva was the author of several hymns of the scripture Rigveda and one of the Angirasas. He had adopted Shakuntala, who was abandoned immediately after her birth by her parents, sage Vishwamitra and the celestial damsel Menaka. Shakuntala’s story has been narrated in the Hindu epic Mahabharata and dramatised by Kālidāsa, considered the greatest poet and dramatist in Sanskrit language, in his play called the Abhijñānaśākuntalam (“The Recognition of Shakuntala\\"). King Dushyanta of Gandhara Kingdom while on a battle campaign was passing through the forests when he and Shakuntala fell in love with each other and got married according to the Gandharva rite (exchanging garlands as a marriage vow) in the hermitage. Since Dushyanta had to leave Shakuntala after some time due to unrest in his capital city, he gave Shakuntala a royal signet (a ring) as a sign of their love, promising her that he would return for her. Once, while Shakuntala was in the hermitage in a pensive dreaming mood thinking about her husband Dushyanta, she did not pay the desired reverential attention to sage Durvasa who was visiting the place. Durvasa, known for his short temper, felt offended by this slight, cursed Shakuntala saying that the person she was dreaming of would forget about her altogether. However, later, Durvasa toned down his curse to mean that the person who had forgotten Shakuntala would remember everything again if she showed him a personal token that had been given to her. As per the curse, Dushyanta refused to recognise her. According to local legend, sage Kanva, realising the gravity of the issue faced by his adopted daughter Shakuntala, directed her to build a shrine in honour of god Ganesha as Siddhi Vinayaka. He assured her that by her sincere prayers Siddhi Vinayaka would bless her and she would once again join her husband Dushyanta. This eventually came true after considerable effort and lapse of time and by which time Shakuntala who had conceived after marrying Dushyanta, also gave birth to a son who came to be known as Bharata according to Mahabharata epic. Pandavas and Kauravas were descendants of Bharata. History The Siddhivinayaka Mahaganapati temple built by Shakuntala with the stated legendary background was submerged under a tank. During the rule of the Peshwa Madhavrao I, to resolve the drought situation in the town, the tank was de-silted to provide drinking water to the town. It was during the de-silting operations that the temple was found buried. The image of god Ganesha was found by Peshwa sardar Ramchandra Mehendale buried in the silt. Soon thereafter, the renovation of the temple was undertaken and a stone temple was built. Peshwa Madhavrao I consecrated the ancient Ganesha image in this new temple, after the conquest of Vasai fort. Initially, the temple was very small with a wooden sabha mandap (audience hall), which was in a run-down condition. Since the Peshwa temple had also degenerated over time, in 1965–66, renovation work was initiated again and a new temple was constructed at the same location at cost of . Architecture and recent renovations The current temple is built on land donated by the Peshwas, which was further supplemented by of additional land donated by Joshis, the hereditary priests of the temple. The existing audience hall, after renovation, measures x and has been provided with galleries that overlook the main hall. The raised platform on which temple has been built with stone is in height. The temple hall has marble flooring. Recently, the eyes and the navel of the image have been decorated with ruby stones. On the right of the main entrance door is a shrine containing a Shiva-linga. In front of the temple, there is also an impressive lamp tower. The temple Shikhara (pinnacle) is decorated with sculptures of the Ashtavinayaka, central images from eight revered Ganesha temples near Pune, Maharashtra. In the main sanctum, on the right corner padukas (foot wear) of Shri Vengaonkar Joshi, a Ganesha devotee is also seen. In May 2009, the temple trust and the Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Corporation (KDMC) have completed renovation of the temple – initiated 5 years ago. At a cost of , the renovation work provides regulated entry arrangements and basic facilities to cater to a very large number of devotees who visit the temple. The lake, Titwala Talav next to the temple, has also been de-silted recently and facilities created for boating. Devotees and auspicious days Based on the popular legend narrated, Hindus believe that by devotional worship of the Titwala Ganesha, marriage to one’s wished person will take place and marital discord will be happily resolved. The temple is visited by lacs of devotees, particularly on Angarika Chaturthi (Angariki) – a Tuesday that follows on the fourth day of the lunar bright fortnight. Tuesday as well as the fourth day of the lunar fortnight are considered auspicious days to worship Ganesha, both of which attract a fair number of worshippers to the temple. Ganesh Chaturthi and Ganesh Jayanti is celebrated with great fervour, when more than people congregate for worship in the temple. Ganesh Chaturthi or Ganeshotsav is the central festival of Ganesha that falls on the fourth day of the bright lunar fortnight in the Hindu month of Bhadrapada (August–September). Ganesha Jayanti or Maghi Ganeshotsav is the birthday of Ganesha, which falls on the fourth day of the bright lunar fortnight in the Hindu month of Magha (January–February). The temple is often frequented by devotees from Mumbai. Topography The Kalu river, is a small river that flows close to Titwala in its upstream reaches. The Kalu River also flows close to Ambivali, a little farther from Titwala.

On each of the levels, the player must find three electronic chips and use them to activate a large teleporter pad which serves as the exit. The base is full of dangers, such as security robots or automatic gun turrets. The protagonist dies instantly when shot, returning to the last touched checkpoint. There are also numerous small teleporters, which transport the protagonist between various areas in the level. Jacek is armed with a gun which can be upgraded by collecting special batteries. A special meter on the right-hand side of the screen shows the current firepower of the gun. There is a limited number of shots of each power level available — once these run out, the firepower of the gun falls down by one level. At higher firepower levels the gun's rate of fire drops down, forcing the player to wait for the gun to cool down before firing again; the temperature of the gun is indicated by another meter on the left-hand side. Touching a checkpoint causes the gun's power level to drop down back to zero. The original Electro Body release contains a copy protection measure, forcing the player to find the right letter in the manual in order to continue from one level to the next. This security measure was removed in the Electro Man version.  Development  According to the memories of Maciej Miąsik, the game was created on the initiative of Marek Kubowicz, the founder of xLand, who made a proposal to Miąsik and Janusz Pelc to develop the first game for his company. The development took nine months. Together, Pelc and Miąsik designed and programmed the game, and created the graphics. The protagonist was given a face-covering helmet, as drawing a convincing face proved too difficult. The game's title was inspired by the electronic body music genre, which was also used by the composer, Daniel Kleczyński, as inspiration for the soundtrack. Electro Body was released in professional packaging, comparable to games released by Western publishers. The box contained an instruction manual, reference card with controls and a cassette tape containing the game soundtrack, thus allowing even players without sound cards to enjoy the music. Creating the boxes at the time was not a simple task for the developers; the boxes were shrink-wrapped by hand, with the help of a kitchen heat sealer and a sandwich toaster. The back of the box was decorated with screenshots made with a photo camera. Advertising material created for the game included posters and radio advertisements. Electro Body was noted for its low system requirements. The game supported every video card on the Polish market, including the Hercules Graphics Card, CGA, EGA and VGA cards; it also supported numerous audio devices, including the PC speaker, Covox Speech Thing or the Sound Blaster. A special release of the game came with a Covox device included in the box. Hoping to get the game picked up by a Western distributor, the developers sent a copy of the game on floppy disk by mail to the American company Epic MegaGames. Epic expressed interest, and xLand representatives met in Rotterdam with Mark Rein; the negotiations were successful, and the game was released in the United States under the title Electro Man. This release was a modified version of the original; the changes included removal of copy protection measures, and removing support for all video modes other than VGA. xLand planned to develop a sequel, under the title Electro Body 2. Planned features of this \\"military 2D platform game\\" included 3D rendered sprites, as well as a new game engine allowing for nine separate planes of scrolling and special effects. However, the game never saw the light of day.  Reception  Electro Body met with critical acclaim in Poland. The reviewer in Top Secret praised its graphics and music, calling it \\"the best Polish PC game so far.\\" PC World Komputer praised the \\"packaging that no western company would be ashamed of\\" and described the graphics as \\"excellent\\". Jacek Maciejewski of PC Magazine Po Polsku considered Electro Body to be a game \\"of a quite high quality\\", but criticized the copy protection, which he found annoying. The reviewer of Świat Gier Komputerowych stated that the game \\"speaks well of the Polish art of programming.\\" The game received more mixed reviews in Germany. PC Games praised its graphics and compared it favorably to games by Apogee Software. However, the review in PC Player panned the game, criticizing its controls and lack of scrolling, and complaining about some actions requiring \\"milimeter-perfect\\" positioning of the player character. The review in ' stated that the graphics and animation was \\"poor\\" and \\"downright laughable\\", and described the controls as awkward. The game was reviewed in 1994 in the Dragon magazine by Sandy Petersen, as part of the Epic Puzzle Pack (a compilation which also included Robbo and Heartlight.) Petersen gave the compilation 3 out of 5 stars. Years after its release, Electro Body was retrospectively considered an important step in the history of Polish computer games. An article on the website GameZilla.pl described it as \\"the first serious twitch of Polish game developers\\". Bartłomiej Kluska, a journalist specializing in the history of Polish games, considered it the first serious Polish production for the PC platform and commended its graphics and \\"attention to detail\\". In 2014 the Polish indie game website 1ndie World held a competition named \\"The Jam\\", with the objective of creating a game inspired by Electro Body. The winning game would receive a professional advertising campaign sponsored by the website Gry- Online, among other prizes. The competition winner was the game Ego Protocol.

Genarro Sambiase Sanseverini was politician and supporter of the Risorgimento and the most notable family member.The Nobility of Naples (Italian). Retrieved 22 May 2011. Duke or Duchess San Donato () was a noble title, first created in 1602 by the Spanish King Philip III for the Sanseverino family. The duchy was traditionally based on estates and territories held in San Donato di Ninea, Calabria. The first creation, however, lasted only 52 years. In 1668, the title was recreated for a wealthy merchant, Antonio Amitrano, who had some years earlier bought the feudal rights over the former dukes' territories. Descendants of the Ametrano family held the duchy, as one several titles, until it became extinct in the 1970s.Libro d'Oro della Nobiltà Italiana, ediz. XX, vol. XXII, 1990-1994, p. 538 There have been successive claims over the centuries by distant kinsmen of the first holders to claim the duchy; these remain unverified. Origin The history of the Duchy of San Donato can be traced to 1374, when following the wedding of Margherita di Sangineto with Venceslao di Sanseverino, Count of Tricarico and Chiaromonte, as part of the bride's dowry, feudal and territorial rights over lands in the area of San Donato di Ninea, passed to Sanseverino family. The family continued to hold the estates until in 1510, when Bernardino Sanseverino, Prince of Bisignano, granted them to a distant relation, Francisco Sanseverino, Baron of Càlvera. This began the lineage of the Sanseverino barons, later to be the first dukes of San Donato. The Sanseverino name was to remain linked, albeit tentatively, with the duchy throughout its history. At the height of its glory throughout Genoa, Venice, Milan, Piacenza, Modena, Capua, Salerno and Naples the family held ten princely titles, twelve duchies, nine marquessates and forty members of the family held the title count.Nobility of Naples, Sanserevino. The 1st creation dukes of San Donato Arms of the Sanseverino family, who held the duchy for 52 years in the 17th century. In 1598, the Baron of Càlvera were elevated, by the governing Spanish authorities, to the rank of Marquess of San Donato. This was to be a stepping stone to greater titles, for on 29 September 1602, Philip III of Spain created Scipione, 3rd Baron of Càlvera and 4th Baron of Policastrello, Duke of San Donato. Thus, establishing the duchy.Títulos nobiliarios concedidos por Monarcas españoles en Nápoles existentes en el archivo general de Simancas, p. 1039-, \\"Duques - San Donato - A Escipión Sanseverino. Valladolid, 29 September 1602\\" (English: Titles of Nobility granted by the Spanish Monarchs of Naples. Recorded in the general archives of Simancas, P. 1039-, \\" Dukes - San Donato - To Escipión Sanseverino. Valladolid, 29 September 1602.) This was a common ploy by the Spanish, for keeping the powerful nobility of the occupied country loyal to Spain, rather than as a reward for any great service on the part of the newly created duke. Three years after the creation of the duchy, greater good fortune was to come to the new duke. In 1605, his mother, Lucrezia Carafa, inherited the estates of Roggiano from the Prince of Bisignano. From this time, the ducal court was now resident for much of the year at Roggiano, rather than San Donato. Scipione, Duke of San Donato died in 1640 and was succeeded to the title by his son, Francesco. Francisco Sanseverino 2nd Duke of San Donato, was born in November 1611. As an aristocrat created by the Spanish, he was heavily involved in the Rebellion of Naples. The rebellion which had begun as a protest against the imposition of taxes place, by the Spanish authorities, on fruit, a staple food, has begun in Sicily and spread to Naples. The rebels principal targets were the tax collectors and the Spanish authorities, a body which included much of the Spanish created aristocracy. When the rebel's leader, Tommaso Aniello suddenly went mad in the middle of the revolt following a visit to the Governor's Palace, it was widely assumed he had been poisoned and the rebellion grew in animosity and spread beyond the city into the surrounding areas. In October 1647, following the failure of Spanish forces to reimpose their rule a republic was declared. However it was to be short lived; the aristocracy raised forces and maintained a blockade of Naples and the rebels, lacking the hoped for support of the French, were quelled and the Spanish were able to restore their authority. However, during the discord of 1647 the 2nd Duke of San Donato, regarded an enemies of the rebels, was murdered together with his daughters.R R Bisignani. I Sanseverino, ramo San Donato, in \\"Calabria Nobilissima\\", 1989. pp. 42–43; pp. 33–70. The Sanseverino line's tenure on the title was now fragile, the sole heiress to the title, Anna, had been injured in the attacks on her father, and aged nine years, she died in 1654 from her injuries. The title was now regarded as extinct and its associated rights reverted to the Royal Court of Naples, still controlled by the Spanish Habsburgs, presided over by Philip IV of Spain. The first creation of the duchy of San Donato had lasted just fifty-two years. The 2nd creation dukes of San Donato Following the extinction of the sanserevino line, the title lay in abeyance. The ducal fiefs and territories which had reverted to the crown were sold to a wealthy merchant Antonio Ametrano, the son of a clerk in the royal household who had made his money in trade and from excises in Calabria. Ametrano paid the Neapolitan royal treasury 72,000 ducats for the fiefs and rights over the former duchy. The Ametrano family were unrelated to the previous holders of the Duchy of San Donato, but in 1668, the title and the lands were reunited when Amitrano was created 1st Duke of San Donato (of the 2nd creation) by Charles II of Spain. Descendants of the Ametrano were to hold the duchy until their line became extinct in the 1970s. During the 300 years that the family held the title, the name of the ducal house changed when the duchy passed through the female line. As the family prospered and intermarried, it acquired further older and grander titles until the duchy of San Donato became a secondary title, often handed out for use to a younger son - while the head of the family and true holder of the title used the superior titles of Prince of Bonifati or Duke of Malvito.

Beginning his professional career in May 1971, he was ranked in the top makuuchi division continuously from March 1979 to January 1992, and his record of 1170 consecutive bouts there is the second best in history after Takamiyama. His highest rank was sekiwake. He was runner-up in one tournament and earned ten kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He also won four sanshō or special prizes. He wrestled for Taihō stable and after his retirement in May 1992 he worked there as a coach before leaving the Japan Sumo Association in 2008. Career Born in Yokkaichi, he came from a sumo family as his father, Ryuichi Matsumoto, was a professional sumo wrestler known as Kenryu Taketora who reached a highest rank of jūryō 1 in 1955. Ōzutsu joined Nishonoseki stable in May 1971 at the age of 15. The great yokozuna Taihō retired in the same tournament and that December he followed Taihō to a newly created heya, Taihō stable. In his early days he wrestled under a different shikona, Daishin. In July 1977 he became a sekitori for the first time upon promotion to the jūryō division. He was injured during the November 1977 tournament and had to withdraw, dropping back to makushita. However, he was never to miss another bout in his career. Upon his return to jūryō in March 1978 he adopted the shikona of Ōzutsu (literally \\"big cannon\\"; he was sometimes nicknamed \\"Top Gun\\"). In September 1978 he claimed the jūryō championship with an 11–4 record (his only career yusho), and in January 1979, after losing a playoff for the championship to Ōshio he was promoted to the top makuuchi division for the March 1979 tournament. Ōzutsu won the Fighting Spirit Prize in his second top division tournament in May 1979, and in July he defeated two yokozuna, Wakanohana and Mienoumi, the first of his ten career kinboshi. In March 1980 he made his san'yaku debut at komusubi but fell short with a 6–9 record. He was runner-up to Kitanoumi with an 11–4 record in March 1981 and was promoted to sekiwake, the highest rank he was to achieve. He held it on two further occasions, in July 1981 and November 1983, and made his final appearance in san'yaku at komusubi in November 1984, continuing as a rank-and-file maegashira for the rest of his makuuchi career. He won his first two bouts against Chiyonofuji before the latter became a yokozuna, and earned two kinboshi from him in September 1984 and March 1986, but was defeated by him on every one of the 37 other occasions they met. He was the man Chiyonofuji beat in September 1989 to reach 965 career wins, more than any other wrestler in history. He remained in the top division for 78 consecutive tournaments but was finally demoted in January 1992 after recording only a 4–11 score at maegashira 15. His 1170th and final bout in makuuchi was a win over Mainoumi. He announced his retirement from sumo two tournaments later at the age of 36 after facing certain demotion to the makushita division. Retirement from sumo Ōzutsu remained in sumo as an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, and worked as a coach at Taihō stable, initially under the name Ōtake Oyakata. In 1997 he switched to the Tateyama kabu when it was vacated by the former ōzeki Daiju. In 2003 Taihō retired as head coach and the former Takatōriki took over, renaming the heya Ōtake stable. Ōzutsu continued to work as a coach there until 2008 when his Tateyama stock, which he was only borrowing, was needed by the retiring Tamakasuga. Ōzutsu had to leave the Sumo Association as a result. He now runs a French-style restaurant in Yokohama. Fighting style Ōzutsu was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, preferring to fight on the mawashi rather than push his opponents. His favourite grip was migi-yotsu, with a right hand inside and left hand outside his opponent's arms. His most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri or force out, but he also regularly used his outside grip to win by uwatenage (overarm throw) and uwatedashinage (pulling overarm throw). He was also fond of tsuridashi, the lift out.

It consists of three buildings: the farmhouse, a complex two-storey house of approximately 99 square metres; an adjacent barn; and a later cowshed. Construction The present farmhouse is 16th century, with an earlier medieval core, and may have been a tower house, a form more associated with Pembrokeshire. It is built from local sandstone quarried from a quarry located in its own land, known as Garreg Llwyd Quarry. Court Farm has a line of corbels on the south facing walls which are a particular feature of old Carmarthenshire buildings and, because of its size and visible location it was, together with the nearby St. Illtud's Church, Pembrey, used a navigational point on local shipping charts to help captains of vessels navigate the treacherous Burry Inlet. Originally, there were seven square chimneys, two of which were unusually set diagonally in the chimney breast in the east wall. It appears that every room had a fireplace, yet the 1672 hearth tax lists the Court as only having two fireplaces, probably to avoid paying tax of two shillings. Similarly, many of the early windows were blocked up to avoid paying the half-yearly window tax of 3 shillings. One room retained its Jacobean panelling until Court Farm was abandoned in around 1948. Court Farm has an interesting large barn, with a defensive military appearance, due its embattled parapet on the south elevation. It is not known if the barn had a defensive function of any kind, although it could be part of a more extensive curtain wall. The Pembrey area was \\"frontier land\\" in Medieval times, lying between the Norman occupied areas of the east, and the Welsh kingdom, north- west of Kidwelly, which continued to attack the Norman strongholds. Ownership by the Le Botelers Evidence suggests that the Le Boteler family were the first to occupy a manor on the site of the present Court Farm.Nicholson, J., A., Pembrey and Burry Port, published by Llanelli Borough Council Maurice de Londres granted the Manor of Pembrey to Sir John Butler of Dunraven in 1128.Roberts, E., & Pertwee, H., A., \\"St. Illtyd’s Church, Pembrey\\", published 1898 Maurice de Londres was the son of William de Londres, who was a knight to Robert Fitzhamon, a Norman baron from Gloucestershire. Fitzhamon invaded Wales between 1091 and 1093, established himself as Lord of Glamorgan and built Cardiff Castle. The knights protecting his castle included William de Londres. As a reward for his services, Fitzhamon gave William the lordship of Ogmore. William went on to help Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, defend his lordship at Kidwelly from attacks by the adjacent Welsh kingdom of Deheubarth. On one of his expeditions to Kidwelly, the inhabitants of Glamorgan attacked Ogmore Castle. William’s butler, called Arnold, successfully repulsed the attack and was rewarded with the castle and manor of Dunraven. To mark his loyalty, Arnold called himself Arnold le Boteler; the Norman word for butler is Le Boteler, or Boteler. The family surname was later anglicized to Butler. Maurice de Londres succeeded to the lordship of Ogmore, upon the death of his father, William, in 1126. In 1128, Maurice also became Lord of Kidwelly when Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, returned his lordship to The Crown, having found it too difficult to protect from the attacks of Deheubarth. The Crown then gave the lordship to Maurice. In the same year, Maurice granted the Manor of Pembrey to Arnold Butler’s son, Sir John Butler, whose male line of issue included seven generations, most of them named John Butler. The line became extinct when Arnold Butler, of Pembrey and Dunraven, died without issue. Arnold’s sister, Ann Butler, then inherited both estates. The manor of Pembrey was held under military tenure under the Lordship of Kidwelly.Duchy of Lancaster Records, 43/12 The occupation of the Manor of Pembrey required each Butler occupant, in time of war, to provide five archers \\"according to ancient custom\\" to help the Lord of Kidwelly within the limits of the land under his control. The Butlers also had to order one knight to attend the \\"Court of Foreignry of Kidwelly\\", which was held every month. Each Butler heir also had an obligation to pay a sum of money to the Lord of Kidwelly of ten shillings, to give a day’s ploughing and to help with the hay for one day.Ashburnham Document Collection N 297, National Library of Wales One of the woods that originally lay on the manorial land of Court Farm is known as Coed Marchog (Knight's Wood, in the English language), it lies on the eastern side of the Pembrey to Pinged Road, below Garreg Lwyd. The Butler's coat of arms appears in Pembrey Church. Its heraldic device is azure, three cups covered, or (heraldry). The Butler coat of arms can be found in the south east window of the nave of St Illtud’s Church, Pembrey. A monument and altar- tomb of Sir John le Boteler, of circa 1250, can be found at St Brides Major church In addition to the land surrounding Court Farm, the Butlers also controlled the vast area of flatlands known as Pembrey Burrows, or the Warren, and the greater part of Pinged Marsh, which is now part of Pembrey Country Park. The Butlers were granted rights to all wrecks found on the Cefn Sidan sands as far as Caldicot Point or Tywyn Point The original caput of the Manor of Pembrey was probably the mound castle now called ‘the Twmpath’, which is located about a mile and a half to the north-east of Burry Port Station. This tumulus is in diameter, with a ditch of about wide and about deep surrounding it. The Twmpath has extensive views, but at some stage it became inconvenient and the caput of the Manor was relocated to the site of the present location of Court Farm.Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, National Monuments Record Ownership by the Vaughans Ann Butler was the last of the Pembrey Butlers. She married Sir Richard Vaughan of Bredwardine, in Herefordshire, the Court Farm and Dunraven estates then became part of the Vaughan family estates. The Vaughans claimed to be direct descendants of the Welsh king Moreiddig Warwyn of Breconshire and north Carmarthenshire. The family has an unusual coat of arms: three boys' heads with snakes coupled around their necks. This is based on a family legend. When the pregnant mother of Moreiddig Warwyn (Warwyn means \\"fair neck\\" in Welsh) was resting in the garden, she was frightened by an adder. Moreiddig was born with a mark, resembling the bite of the adder, on his neck. Sir Richard Vaughan was born in 1460 and was knighted at Tournai, in 1513. He became High sheriff of Herefordshire in 1530, and again in 1541. Sir Richard was succeeded by his son, Sir Walter Vaughan (1500–1584), who inherited the three estates of Pembrey, Dunraven and Bredwardine. Sir Walter was born at Dunraven Castle, where his parents had decided to live. After his marriage, he moved to Pembrey, and Court Farm was built as a wedding present for him by his father, in about 1530. The Vaughan part of the current building is the main L-shaped section, facing south and east. Sir Walter was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1557 and also a Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire. His son, Sir Thomas Vaughan, inherited the three estates and added to it the Fullerston Estate, in Wiltshire. Sir Thomas was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1566 and 1570. Sir Thomas had a son, also called Sir Walter Vaughan, who inherited the estates but decided to live at Fullerston. He added Caldicot Farm to the estate holdings, in around 1607. During this period, Court Farm was occupied by Sir Walter’s nephew, Roland Vaughan, until the next Vaughan heir, Sir Charles Vaughan, was old enough to take possession. Charles was Sir Walter’s son by his first wife. He bought Porthaml Mansion, near Talgarth in Breconshire, and Court Farm was then occupied by his son, Sir George Vaughan. Sir George Vaughan was a fervent Royalists and supported King Charles I against Oliver Cromwell, in the English Civil War. As a consequence, in 1648, Sir George Vaughan was imprisoned by Cromwell for a short time at Southwark and fined £2,609 for his \\"Delinquency\\". Cromwell is believed to have passed through the parish of Pembrey in 1648, on his way to Ireland and his soldiers may have visited Court Farm to charge and apprehend Sir George at that time. Sir George returned to Court Farm, but the huge fine meant that he had to sell the Dunraven estate, in 1648, and the Fullerston estate, in 1649. Sir George died without issue and the remaining Pembrey and Porthaml estates passed to his younger brother, the Reverend Frederick Vaughan, who had been blind from infancy as a result of smallpox. Frederick Vaughan’s only son, Sir Walter Vaughan, married Alice Bond of Wiltshire, in 1653. They lived, in turn, on both estates and had two children, Bridget and Walter. The male line of the Vaughans of Pembrey ended when Sir Walter’s son died in his first year. After the death of Sir Walter Vaughan, Alice Vaughan married William Ball in 1655. He was a lawyer of Gray's Inn and became High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1682 and died in 1701. They lived, in turn, at the Porthaml and Pembrey estates. Many famous people are said to have been entertained at the Court, including the painters Van Dyke, Lely and Reynolds, who painted the Vaughan family. Some of these portraits can now be seen in Carmarthen museum. Relationship with the Dalton family Under the Vaughans, the Pembrey Estate was administered by agents comprising at least three generations of the \\"capable and loyal\\" Dalton family. It was probably during this period that a number of fireplaces were blocked up. One of Court Farm’s more impressive architectural features comprises seven tall chimneys, made up of five single stacks and two diagonal twin stacks. These reflect a house of substance with many hearths, but the 1672 Hearth Tax records the house as having only two fireplaces. As an economy measure, many of the original fireplaces were blocked-up in order to avoid paying Hearth Tax at the then substantial rate of two shillings per hearth. The Dalton family appear to originate from Witney in Oxfordshire, and some of the family are buried at St. Illtud’s Church, Pembrey, where entries can be found in the Church’s burial register. Relationship with the Ashburnhams Bridget Vaughan married John Ashburnham, 1st Earl of Ashburnham, in 1677 at Henry VII's Chapel, in Westminster Abbey. She was 17 and he was 21 years old. Thereafter they lived at the family's ancestral mansion, Ashburnham Place, in Ashburnham, near Battle, Sussex and made only occasional visits to the other estates. The Ashburnham family had been settled in Sussex for many generations, taking their name from a village called Ashburnham located in the parish of Ashburnham and Penhurst about north-west of Hastings. Like the Vaughan family, the Ashburnham family were fervent Royalists. They suffered heavy fines and imprisonment by the Parliamentarians. After the Restoration, the family was given numerous crown leases to compensate for losses under the commonwealth, and the post of Groom of the Bedchamber.Jones, Francis, \\"Pembrey Court: An Old Carmarthenshire Manor House, A Tale of Continuity\\", The Carmarthenshire Antiquary Lord John Ashburnham was married 10 years before he saw Court Farm. He noted in his diary, on Sunday, 3 July 1687, that: > \\"I saw Pembrey House (Court), which is an old stone house, large enough and > kept in pretty good repaire. The land hereabouts is very good.\\" Mee Arthur, Ed., \\"Carmarthenshire Miscellany\\", 1892 In 1697 the government introduced a window tax of three shillings per window. In order to reduce the amount of tax payable, the Ashburnham estate arranged for many of Court Farm’s stone and wooden mullion windows to be blocked up. Window tax was repealed in 1851, but the large windows on the west of the house have remained blocked to the present day. John Ashburnham died at his London residence in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, on 21 January 1709 aged 44. His eldest son, William, succeeded him as second baron but died of smallpox on 16 June 1710. The Ashburnham Estates then passed to his brother John, who became third baron. On 14 May 1730, he became Viscount St Asaph of the Principality of Wales and Earl of Ashburnham. The family had been elevated in the peerage, because a viscount is one step above the lowest rank of baron. He died on 10 March 1736–7 at the age of 49 and his only son, John, succeeded to the estate as John Ashburnham, 2nd Earl of Ashburnham. The second Earl died on 8 April 1812 aged 87 and his only son, George Ashburnham, succeeded as George Ashburnham, 3rd Earl of Ashburnham. In 1813, George Ashburnham took legal action to bar the entail of his Pembrey Estate so that he could regain the freehold. After that he could mortgage the estate, which he did on 15 June 1824, together with his other Carmarthenshire and Breconshire properties. Lord Lovaine and Robert Vyner, Esq. of Gautby, Lincolnshire were the mortgagees, and the loan was £19,403,4s, 6d. George Ashburnham died on 27 October 1830 and his son Bertram became the fourth earl. When visiting the Pembrey Estate George Ashburnham usually stayed at Pembrey House, which the family had built on the slope to the north east of St Illtud's Church, Pembrey, in 1823 and which has since been demolished. The house was occasionally let, with rooms being reserved for family use. However, in the 1891 census, Lord Ashburnham, 5th Earl, is recorded as staying at the Ashburnham Hotel. Relationship with the Mansel family After the death of Bridget Vaughan’s stepfather, William Ball, in 1701, Court Farm was leased to Rawleigh Mansel, of Llangunnor Parish. He was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1679 and, according to The Red Dragon periodical (1886), he went to live at Court Farm: > “thoroughly repairing that old mansion for the purpose, and lived there for > three or four years, and died there on 27 November 1702 in his 73rd year” His grandson, Rawleigh Dawkin Mansel, who was High Sheriff in 1730, then lived as tenant at Court Farm. During the tenancy of Rawleigh Dawkin Mansel the house was divided into two separate living sections and accommodated two separate families. Walls were added or removed, several doors and windows were blocked and new ones opened, additional stairs were fitted and at least two attic rooms were added. During this period David Thomas (1738/39-1788) was born at Court Farm. Rawleigh Dawkin Mansel was High Sheriff for Carmarthenshire in 1730 and died ‘under the agonizing pains of the Gout’ in his 44th year in 1749. Thereafter, Court Farm was home to several Ashburnham agents, stewards and other estate officials. On Kitchen’s map of 1701 Court Farm is clearly marked as: ‘Court, Mansel, Esq.’ Edward Lluyd’s visit In 1700, Edward Lluyd, a graduate of Jesus College, Oxford, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and a noted Celtic scholar and antiquary, visited Pembrey Court and reported as follows:- > “Penbre Court, ye Seat formerly of the Butlers and afterwards of the > Vaughans, and now belonging (in right of his Lady) to [William] Ball, Esqr, > whence it descends to my Ld Ashburnham’s Lady………..Diwlais Brook divides this > parish from Llan Elhi, springing at Croslaw Mountain and falls into the > sea………Here are 2 lakes close together called Swan Pool where there are > plenty of Eels, and in the Winter store of Fowls such as Ducks and Teal, > sometimes wild Swans or Elks and wild Geese. The adjoining one, stored with > Turbot, Bret and Sole. They take here a large sort of fish called Friers or > Monk fish (in Hereford, Gloucester, and Worcester, whither they carry them, > Soucing Fish) about May, June and July. This Pool (or Pools for both may be > called one) is called Swan Pool because the Lord of the Manor (Mr Ball) has > thereon about 40 Swans. Before the hard frost there were about 80, which all > died to 6.\\" Swan Pool was located near Towyn Mawr, and has since been drained. Appropriately, the location is now known as Swan Pool Drain. A picturesque pond, located near to the house, and close to the Mountain Road, was also drained in about 1937. Relationship with the Thomas family David Thomas was born at Court Farm during the tenancy of the Mansels, when the house was divided into two. He was a gifted, but unqualified, bone setter from an illustrious family practising bone setting, and is buried in St Illtud's Church, Pembrey. The Thomas family proved to have other talents, and many vocations. Three generations are listed in the Church's registers as farmers, butchers, shopkeepers, and shipowners of vessels that traded from Pembrey, Old Harbour. On 24 July 1843, John Thomas, a farmer, and David Thomas, a shopkeeper, jointly registered a brigantine of 185 tons burthen known as the \\"ELIZA\\" at Llanelli. Its master was John Thomas junior and it traded to Liverpool, Malta, Ancona, Venice and as far as San Francisco, where the whole crew deserted the ship to join the Californian gold rush. Consequently, the ship was anchored, with hundreds of others, in San Francisco harbour for several years. She was later sold, along with many other ships, by the United States Marshall. John Thomas also owned a sloop of 29 tons burthen called the \\"SEDULOUS\\", which was built in Cardigan and registered at Llanelli on 15 February 1842. Its registry was cancelled on 19 March 1842. Hugh Thomas, together with some other investors, owned the \\"MARGARET JANE\\", a vessel built at Pwllheli in 1850, and whose registry was cancelled on 13 December 1865. In 1831, Mr. Edward Driver, a surveyor, made a \\"Survey and Valuation of the Manor of Pembrey and Estate\\" on behalf of Bertram Ashburham. At this time, Court Farm comprised 194 acres plus of marshland. The tenant was recorded as John Thomas (later succeeded by his son Hugh) who paid a yearly rent of £88.10s. John Thomas occupied a part of the Mansion, whilst a Mr. T.E. Biederman occupied the other part. Mr. Driver reported as follows: > \\"One portion of the Old Court House is occupied by Mr. Biederman. The other > portion comprises a very good large kitchen, small cellar, old Entrance > Hall, a parlour not inhabitable but now undergoing repairs and filling up, > and a new staircase has been lately made to lead to two new formed bedrooms. > At the back of the House is a range of offices comprising (besides some held > by Mr. Biederman) a dairy and a cheese loft. A newly erected cowhouse and > stable with slated roof, and enclosed yard. Adjoining the House is a good > barn with cowhouse; coach-house at the end, hereafter described, and held by > Mr. Biederman; a stock yard with cowhouse, and another barn, slated, and a > lean-to carthouse, thatched, at the back…\\" Later in the survey, Mr. Driver wrote: > “Part of the Court House and buildings, heretofore generally used by the > Agent, but for the last 3 or 4 years was occupied by his brother and T. E. > Biederman. The buildings comprise the old Court House, and was formerly a > good residence; it is stone built with slated roof; part has been kept for > the accommodation of the Agent to the Estate, and this is now occupied, and > has so been for 3 or 4 years by Mr T.

Bredwardine Court and Porthaml Mansion, two other ancestral homes of the Vaughans, have similar surviving roofs.Vaughan-Poppy, Ithiel, \\"The Homes of the Vaughans of Carmarthenshire\\", Volume 2, March 1981 However, part of the original roof of Court Farm was lowered and flattened during alterations made during the 19th century, and the carved ornamental detail of the original trussed roof was lost. In addition, the original stone tiles, which needed a more steeply pitching roof, were replaced with Caernarvon slates (as reported in Mr. Driver’s survey), and the roof valleys were finished off with lead flashing. The 1878 Ordnance Survey map gives the first known ground plan of Court Farm, this shows the original Vaughan L-shaped structure, with two wings enclosing a courtyard in the rear. Nearby, on the south side, is the barn. A large enclosed garden is outlined, together with Court Wood, said to have been planted by the Vaughans. A Tithe Schedule and map dated 7 June 1839 shows Court Farm with , a slight increase in landholding since the survey of Mr Driver, with Mr. John Thomas still the tenant. The Thomas family were tenants of Court Farm from 1738 to 1902, and most of their baptisms, marriages and burials are recorded in the registers of St Illtyd Church, Pembrey. The Tithe Schedule also includes the names of all the surrounding fields, including Clos Edwin, Wedlanis, Abel Dawnsi, Hunting Knap, and Mumble Head. Two fields, Garreg Lwyd and Maes Graig Lwyd, may have had a religious origin. Industrial activities It was during the ownership of the Pembrey Estate by the Ashburnhams that trial workings for coal were made. These proved to be successful and a number of levels and pits were opened in Coed y Marchog (Knight’s Wood) and Coed Rhial (Royal Wood) on the western slope of Pembrey Mountain. Management of the colliery was undertaken from an office at Court Farm and the coal was carried by packhorse to the estuary of the River Gwendraeth and to the Burry Inlet, from here it was shipped to the west of England and Ireland.Morris, W., H., \\"The Canals of the Gwendraeth Valley\\" (Part I), The Carmarthenshire Antiquary The second Earl Ashburnham, impressed by the success of a canal built by Thomas Kymer in the Gwendraeth valley, decided upon a similar scheme for his Pembrey colliery. Kymer’s Canal was built between 1766 and 1768 in order to carry coal from pits and levels at Pwll y Llygod and Great Forest (near Carway) to a place of shipment on the Lesser Gwendraeth river near Kidwelly. The Ashburnham canal ran from the foot of Pembrey Mountain to the Gwendraeth estuary and its aim was to improve the transport of coal from the Pembrey colliery to the sea. The plan initially encountered opposition from colliers, whose ponies used to do the job, but by 1796 work on the canal had begun below Coed Farm, close to the Llandyry-Pinged road. By 1799, the canal had extended across the Kidwelly- Pembrey road, near to Saltrock Farm, and by the end of 1801 it had reached the sea at Pill Towyn, a creek running in from the south bank of the Gwendraeth Fawr river. Two shipping places were built on the canal, one of them at Pill Ddu, and the total length of the canal was about two miles (3 km). Flat terrain meant that there were no locks, and in 1805 a short branch was constructed towards Ffrwd when new levels were opened in Coed Rhial. The entrance to Pill Ddu was deepened in 1816 and a dry dock was added in 1817. By 1818, however, the colliery had become exhausted and the canal became redundant. In the returns of Owners of Land in 1873, Bertram Ashburnham is shown as having substantial estates in Wales, with producing an estimated annual rental of £3,547 in Carmarthenshire, and producing an estimated annual rental of £1,963 in Breconshire. In Sussex, the family seat, produced £13,069. Sale of the Ashburnham estate Bertram Ashburnham died on 22 June 1878 aged 80. His eldest of seven sons, also named Bertram, succeeded as fifth Earl and actively participated in the development of industry in Pembrey. He died in 1913 leaving an only child, Lady Mary Cathleen Charlotte Ashburnham. The title thus passed to his younger brother, Thomas, the sixth and last Earl of Ashburnham, who had married Maria Elizabeth Anderson of Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada in 1903. George Ashburnham had taken out a mortgage on his Welsh estates in 1824 for £19,403,4s, 6d after he had freed the Welsh properties from entail on certain leases. By 1897 the mortgage debt on the Welsh properties had increased to £87,600, as the loan had not been repaid on its due date. In order to repay the loan, the Porthaml estate was sold in 1913 and the Pembrey estate in 1922. Thomas Ashburnham died without issue on 12 May 1924, leading to the extinction of the Ashburnham title. Court Farm was tenanted by the Thomas family until around 1902. After that, William Bonnell (senior), and his family, were tenants. The house once again became a single dwelling. The Bonnell family farmed Court Farm until August 1922, when the whole of the Ashburnham Estate was sold. The sale was a major local event. The Ashburnhams had, for 245 years, controlled much of Pembrey Parish, and been intimately involved in turning it into a centre of industry. At the auction Mr William Bonnell (senior) purchased Penllwyn Uchaf Farm and thereafter vacated Court Farm. Court Farm was advertised for sale by auction on 14 September 1929, subject to tenancy, and plans could be inspected at the auctioneer's office or the local butchers. Mr James Butler of Treorchy bought Court Farm at the auction. The Manor was then let to the family of Mr Sidney Thomas. They remained as tenants after the death of Mr Butler, in 1937, and the purchase of the Manor by Mr Charles Harding from the Links, Pembrey. Mr Harding bought Pembrey Court as a business proposition. He developed the Garreg Lwyd quarries, located on Court Farm land, as a brickworks, and used material from the quarry for his brick mixture. The brickwork project failed when the brick making machinery ran into technical difficulties. Probably as a result of these activities, a large front section of the quarry collapsed. Ownership by the Bonnell family In 1942, Mr Harding sold Court Farm to William Bonnell (junior), who lived at Penllwyn Uchaf farm. However, the Thomas family remained as tenants until about 1948, after which Court Farm was left empty. Mr William Bonnell (Junior) continued to live at Penllwyn Uchaf Farm until his death in January 1962 and during this time Pembrey Court was used for storage. After William Bonnell's death, Court Farm passed to his younger brother, Mr Owen Bonnell. During the 1970s, Court Farm remained unoccupied and thieves twice stole the lead flashings from the roof. After the first theft, Mr Owen Bonnell replaced the lead, but after the second theft he could see little point in replacing it again. It was at this stage that the structure of the house began to deteriorate. Nevertheless, in 1972, he appointed Messrs, Peter Howell and Donald Jones, Architects, of Uplands, Swansea to apply for grant aid from the Historic Buildings Council. The Marquis of Anglesey and representatives of the Historic Buildings Council visited Court Farm in order to assess the property for grant aid, but their report to the Secretary of State for Wales pointed out that the property was beyond repair and so a grant was refused.Court Farm Feasibility Study, 1985, \\"Background Information\\", section 5 Owen Bonnell died in January, 1976 and Court Farm was inherited by his nephew, John Bonnell Davies, who was born at Court Farm. He is the present owner and lives in Pembrey. Community interest in Court Farm In 1972, the possibility of saving Court Farm was first put forward to the former Carmarthenshire County Council, but it was believed that the building had deteriorated too far and would cost an estimated £50,000 to put right. Considerable theft and vandalism left the property in a badly damaged condition, and so a planning application was made by the owners for consent to demolish the building. On 23 October 1980, Llanelli Borough Council refused the application for the following reasons: > ~ [Court Farm] is a Grade II Listed Building of special architectural and > historic interest, which is capable of renovation, rehabilitation and use, > which would ensure its future conservation; and > ~ in line with national policy, the Borough Council is disposed not to grant > consent for the demolition of Listed Buildings which are capable of > preservation or conservation. Despite the decline in the fortunes of Court Farm, local concern for the building remained strong, as evidenced by the publicity in the local press. The late Mr John Evans, of Erw Terrace, Burry Port, who was a member of Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society, commenced a campaign to save Court Farm and. in August 1981, a Court Farm Committee was established. The Committee requested that the Borough Council place a compulsory purchase order on the building and plans were formulated to restore it and develop it as a museum, in a £100,000 project phased over 3 years. Unfortunately, the plans suffered a setback when solicitors representing the owners refused to accept a valuation figure of £4,000 for the site.Western Mail, \\"Ex-teacher fights to save Historic farmhouse\\", 11 August 1980 On 19 October 1984, another application was made to demolish Court Farm, but the application was refused. The refusal notice, issued on 18 July 1985, stated that demolition was considered premature, due to the Borough Architect’s museum feasibility study. By 14 November 1984, the Western Mail newspaper was reporting on the proposed 48-hour fast of Mr John Evans. The planned fast was the \\"ultimate threat\\" if demolition were to come about and \\"would be a last resort gesture\\".Western Mail, \\"Fast plan to save old building\\", 13 November 1984 In his campaign to save the building, Mr Evans wrote to the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Elwyn Jones (a native of Llanelli), to the Archbishop of Wales, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Llanelli Borough Council, Dyfed County Council, the Welsh Office, the Welsh Development Agency, Members of Parliament, Government Ministers, various trusts and influential academics.Western Mail, \\"Walker urged to save manor house\\", 29 June 1987 Letters of support were received from the Prince of Wales, who was reported to be pleased that efforts were being made to save Court Farm, and a letter of support was also received from Professor Sir Glanmor Williams.Touch and Go, \\"Campaign, Some Progress!\\", 21 May-17 June 1983 By 1985, local concern was such that funding was made available for a feasibility study for the property. Cadw generously offered a grant of 50% towards the cost of preparation of the study and the balance came from Llanelli Borough Council. The feasibility study concluded that Court Farm was worth retaining on the basis of :- > \\\\- its uniqueness in the district and probably Wales, particularly in a > locality predominantly shaped by the Industrial Revolution; > \\\\- its rich variety of architectural features within a single building; > \\\\- virtually no examples of medieval or Tudor settlement remain in the > district; and > \\\\- the extent of local interest and concern over the future of the property, > which has long formed part of the local history and character of the village > of Pembrey. Court Farm Feasbility Study, 1985, \\"Deirability of Retention\\", chapter 7 On 30 August 1985, Llanelli Borough Planning Officer, Mr Clive Davies, stated that the ultimate step of demolition would not be justified until the results of the feasibility study were known. Apart from Mr Evans and Cadw, others who objected to demolition included the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments in Wales, Dyfed Archaeological Trust, Llanelli Civic Society and Pembrey Community Council.Western Mail, \\"Fasting threat stays over farm’s future\\", 30 August 1985 In November 1985, the Reverend W. Roberts of Burry Port wrote to the Western Mail Civic Pride Competition Western Mail, \\"Why Court Farm must be saved\\", 24 November 1985 arguing for the preservation of Court Farm, and concluded with the following call to action: > \\"Summing up, the ancient St. Illtud’s Church remains; the notorious wreck- > strewn and beautiful Cefn Sidan Sands remain; the third part of the trinity > must also remain. In reality, the neglect of the ancient monument is a local > and national scandal. Court Farm must be restored.\\" Meanwhile, plans by Llanelli Council to restore Court Farm had stalled because the asking price remained too high.Western Mail, \\"Farmhouse museum plan hit by land value clash\\", 28 August 1981 On 27 June 1987, Mr John Evans urged the Secretary of State for Wales, Mr Peter Walker, to take over the planned restoration, fearing that otherwise the plans would come to nothing. By this stage, the proposed Court Farm museum was in jeopardy because of plans to develop a Heritage and Tinplate Centre at Kidwelly which is now Kidwelly Industrial Museum. The importance of Court Farm was still recognised by Cadw, however, and in July 1987 they agreed to offer a grant to fund restoration at a rate of 60%, which was 10% above the then usual rate. Sadly, Cadw’s offer was not taken up and changes in grant regulations meant that the offer lapsed.Western Mail, \\"Ancient mansion may find a new role\\", 29 January 1988 However, there was renewed hope when, on 29 January 1988, Llanelli Borough Council announced plans to buy the property in order to develop it as a tourist promotion and information office. Mr George Harris, estate officer for Llanelli Borough Council, stated that the situation of Court Farm would not be suitable as a tourist attraction in itself, but could be used as a base to promote tourist interest in the Llanelli area. Court Farm remains posted as a building at risk on the web site of SAVE Britain’s Heritage and the posting attracted the interest of Cadw Sir Gaerfyrddin/Carmarthenshire Building Preservation Trust who obtained funding to conduct a fresh feasibility study, which was completed in 2003 by Davies Sutton Architecture. This architectural firm have successfully restored Sker House, a similar type of building.Davies Sutton Architecture et al, Feasibility Study for Cadw Sir Gaerfyrddin Cyf.: \\"Court Farm, Pembrey, Carmarthenshire\\", June 2003 This Study was funded with by Cadw and the Architectural Heritage Fund. The Study established the intrinsic value of Court Farm and looked at all the options for saving the building. The Study established that the building represented an important historical resource and could be saved for a new beneficial use, with repair retaining a flexible layout, allowing fitting-out for an optimum end use. The structural engineer’s report, prepared by Mann Williams Consulting Civil and Structural Engineers of Cardiff collateral to the Study provided a structural assessment and report on the basis of an inspection carried out during February 2003. This stated that \\"the main walls remain reasonably plumb and stable when considering the extensive period of neglect. Replacement of floors and roof structures will reinstate the necessary support to the walls and provide a significant improvement to stability.\\" Relationship with the sea Court Farm has a panoramic view of Carmarthen Bay and is the only surviving Elizabethan manor house in Carmarthenshire. Before the construction of Whiteford Lighthouse, Court Farm and St Illtud's Church, Pembrey formed two of the few prominent local landmarks in the Pembrey area and so became important navigational aides. It is the seven \\"towering chimneys\\" that made Court Farm such a landmark, and both the Manor and Church are clearly marked on William Jones of Loughor’s ‘Plan or Directions for Ships to Come Safe into Burry and to Several Places of Safety to be within the Same’, made in 1757. The Burry Inlet has always been a notoriously difficult place to navigate, due to the quickly changing course of the river and shifting sand banks. Ships crossing the Burry Bar, which is roughly on a line drawn from Burry Holms on Gower to Tywyn Sands or Cornel Mawr, near Pembrey, were crossing a treacherous area. Charts indicate that the contours of the estuary are constantly changing. As an example, in 1764 John Wesley crossed the Burry Inlet on horseback from Pembrey on his way to Oxwich, in Gower. Today, such a crossing would not be possible. In the 17th century, Sir Walter Vaughan, conceived a life saving sea rescue scheme, and as local Member of Parliament, enthusiastically tried to get the Government to take-up his plans, to no avail. Wrecking rights and maritime enterprises The Butlers had been granted rights to all wrecks found on the Cefn Sidan sands, and so for centuries the Lord of the Manor of Pembrey had rights and privileges over the disposal of wrecks found along the coast. Cefn Sidan was frequently the graveyard of many unsuspecting vessels, whose victims were buried in the grounds of Pembrey Church, including a relative of Napoleon's Josephine. Entries in the Pembrey Church registers record numerous burials of passengers and crew. The demand for coal, in the 19th century, led to a big increase in the number of wrecks along the coast. Despite this close connection with the sea, when King Charles I asked Sir Walter Vaughan if he could supply the Crown with a ship of 30 tons, Sir Walter avoided the issue by claiming that Carmarthenshire was an inland county with only a few creeks. However, this did not prevent Sir Walter from acquiring possession of at least two ships at auction, after mishaps led to them running aground at Pembrey. One of these was of 60 tons burthen and known as \\"DOROTHY\\". She was registered at Burry and leased for a voyage from Laugharne to Chester, with a cargo of salt. The other ship was the vessel \\"HOPE\\", she was registered at Harborough, but was driven by a storm into the North Burry Road in June 1631, damaging the cargo of salt and leading to the desertion of the vessel by her crew. Sir Walter acquired possession of both vessels and cargoes and later assigned them to a Plymouth merchant for £500. Manorial dispute By the end of the 18th century, uncertainty had arisen as to the exact area to which the Lord Ashburnham, at that time, the Lord of the Manor of Pembrey, and Lord Cawdor, Lord of Kidwelly held rights. Both agreed that their agents and their legal advisers should be allowed to investigate their claims, and depositions were taken from a number of older local men, who indicated that uncertainties about the rights had set in during the 17th century. The statements of Lord Ashburnham sought to claim that Lord Ashburnham’s tenants had always exercised their right to take any wreck or articles found on the shore to a recognised storage place, or even to Court Farm itself. The salvors were then granted a sum of money to cover the \\"salvage and expenses\\". It may be that such articles were stored in the barn at Court Farm. The following are two examples of the many depositions that were made in favour of the Ashburnham estate: > “1663, 8th day of June, John William Arnold, yeoman of Pembrey, aged 75, > Sworn and Examined before the Court of the Steward…” he had always assumed > that he had the right to claim any material from the wrecks on behalf of the > “Lordship of Ashburnham until now and of late.” > “1664, 14th day of July, David William John, village of Pembrey, yeoman, > four score years, Sworn and Examined before the Court of the Steward…did lay > claim, title unto any of the wreck or materials that happened to be cast up > by the sea upon any of the lands within the Lordship of Pembrey by > Permission of the Lord of the Manor and his agents.” By 1830 the dispute had been settled amicably, without a court case, and the agreement allowed Lord Ashburnham to maintain his ancient manorial rights over the Pembrey foreshore, and Lord Cawdor to maintain his rights over the Kidwelly foreshore. The agreement document stated: > “The right of wreck upon this immediate part of the coast (Caldecott) seems > not to have been distinctly exercised within living memory of man, but > whenever a ship has been stranded, large parties come down from the Country, > some joining the tenantry of Lord Ashburnham, and others the tenantry of > Lord Cawdor, and whichever proved the stronger party took the greater share > of the Prey.” Proceeds and sale of wrecks Cargo from wrecked vessels was sometimes carried in carts to farms owned by Lord Ashburnham and, when the owner made a claim on the property, Lord Ashburnham’s agent would charge a salvage fee. The following are examples of wrecks claimed by Lord Ashburnham and listed in the 1830 agreement document: > 1763 Received balance left unpaid of Wine (salvaged) sold this year, 8s. > 10d. For salvage of the tobacco ship that came ashore at Pembrey, 5gns. For > timber that came ashore at Pembrey, £1. 10. 0. > 1764 For ‘uldge’ cast with a small supply of rum in it that came on shore > £4. 10. 0. > 1766 Caldecott: received for a boat taken up at Towin (in Caldecott) > afterwards claimed on oath by Capt. Jones of Carmarthen, 1d. > 1768 Caldecott: received the profit of 4 casks of wine, sold by auction at > Towin on 15th March 1768, £17. 4. 0. > 1770 Received for the salvage of a Dutch vessel, stranded on the fee farm at > Caldecott, 5gns. Received for a hogshead of claret, £4. 18. 0, but deducted > 5s. for carriage of it from the sand of Towin. > 1776 Received of Mr. Griffith the Collector of Customs at Llanelly, the > produce of the tobacco of the ship “POMPEY”, thrown on Pembrey Manor in > February 1773, £83. 4. 0. There are also occasional accounts in Ashburnham documents of sales of wreck found on the Pembrey sands: > “Account of wreck sold by William Davies for the Right Honourable the Earl > of Ashburnham – collected from Pembrey Manor (The Court). > September 1804 To piece of elm, timber sold, being 8 cwts. and a half at 2s. > 0. 17s 0 > August 1805 To an old cannon sold to Mr Morgan at 4 @ 2/6 10s 0 > Received from Steven Jones for use of the storeroom at Court to put the late > wreck £1. 1s. 0 Eventually, all wrecks became the sole responsibility of the Receiver of Wrecks and Droits and it was his prerogative to dispose of a wreck, and its cargo, by auction, or any other suitable means. By this time, all ships from the Pembrey area were registered with the Register of British Ships at the port of Llanelli, and each ship was issued with a certificate of registry and details of the vessel were entered in the Register. Looting There were reputed to be many wreckers in the Pembrey area. \\"Mat of the Iron Hand\\", who had lost a hand and boasted an iron hook, used to tie lanterns to the sheep grazing on the headlands during a winter storm to draw vessels into shore. One day, these false lights lured a ship onto the rocks before Sir Walter Vaughan could get the boats of his sea rescue crew out to save them. It was said that Mat's custom was to kill all survivors, so that there could be no witnesses. One swimmer that he allegedly despatched turned out to be John Walter Vaughan, the eldest son of Sir Walter Vaughan. As Mat had been imprisoned, over the years by, Sir Walter, he took his revenge by cutting off the young man's hand. As he did so, he noticed that he was wearing a gold signet ring with the well- known Vaughan crest of the three boys' snake-entwined heads, given to John Walter on attaining his majority. This was the private seal of the family. Mat was subsequently hanged. Manorial hedgerows and woodland In 1979 a group of Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society members carried out some hedge counting on Court Farm land. This involves counting the number of different tree species in alternate 30m lengths of hedgerow. Each species in the hedge approximates to one hundred years.\\"Hedges and landscape history - Pembrey Court\\", The Carmarthenshire Antiquary A narrow strip of land near the Court, known as the \\"Narrow Yard\\" (Llathed Fain, in Welsh) was traditionally granted, or leased, by the Lord of the Manor to a favoured yeoman, who quickly delineated his property with a surrounding hedge. At Court Farm, the field shapes do suggest enclosure of former \\"strips\\" or \\"lands\\" in an open field system. The Antiquarian Society found that, on average, there were five tree species per hedge, indicating an early 16th-century enclosure from open fields. Most of the survey effort was concentrated here, and in the Kidwelly area, because of the amount of medieval, and later, documentation available for this area, which can act as a \\"control\\" check for dates obtained from species counting. The constituent manors of local lordships are described in a 1609 Survey. This covers different soils, field types, settlement patterns and tenurial customs of the Welshries and Englishries. Dr. Max Hooper, of the Nature Conservancy, pioneered this system of calculation from English hedgerows, whose antiquity was attested by similar documents, such as hedged parts of Anglo-Saxon estate boundaries delineated in the charters, medieval \\"assarts\\" or clearances in the forest or waste registered in the Court Rolls, etc. The equation between age and number of species present is due to the relative abundance of colonizing species in the immediate vicinity, and the rate at which some species can colonize existing hedges, whether planted or made by clearing woodland either side of them. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a large number of oak trees were planted on the eastern slope below Garreg Llwyd Quarry. In early times the oak tree was sacred to the Druids, and in 1842 a newspaper reported that \\"A grand Druidic procession took place in Pembrey\\", although it is not clear if there is any link to the wood. During the early 19th century, women were employed in the area to strip the bark of the oak trees, which was sent to the nearest tannery, where tannin was extracted from the bark and used in leather production. Relationship to St Illtud's Church, Pembrey Fanciful claims have been made that a tunnel connected Court Farm with the nearby St Illtud's Church. Court Farm used to have a large and heavy stone bowl, filled by spring water, in its grounds, which was used to water cattle for almost a hundred years by Court Farm’s tenant farmers. This was believed to be the \\"lost\\" Norman font bowl of the Church, and subsequently, the bowl was moved to the Lady Chapel of the Church in 1933, where it still remains. Antiquarian interest in Court Farm Interest in Court Farm goes back over a number of decades. On the afternoon of Saturday, 12 September 1970 the Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society held its final Field Day of the 1970 season, when a visit was made to the Pembrey area. The seventy members were conducted by Mr W.H. Morris of Kidwelly and Mr Brynmor Voyle of Llanelli. After assembling at Trimsaran, the party proceeded to a point on Pembrey Mountain where they paused to admire a panoramic view of Carmarthen Bay. At Court Farm Mr. Brynmor Voyle outlined the main architectural and historical features of the mansion, including its single hall-type structure. Members were, unfortunately, unable to inspect the inside of the house. The castellated barn structure in front of the mansion aroused a great deal of interest.\\"Field Day - Pembrey\\", The Carmarthensjire Antiquary At St. Illtud's Church, the Reverend T.A. Jones welcomed the party and made special mention of \\"Butler's Window\\" and the hagioscope, the opening in the church tower through which lepers viewed the consecration of the bread and wine at the altar. Members then inspected the parish registers, dating from 1700 and the memorial to families such as Rees of Cilymaenllwyd, Mansel of Stradey, Vaughan of Trimsaran, Thompson of Glyn Abbey and Wedge of Goodig.

She had previously been operated by the Germans under the name Kingani named after the river Kingani. After a short career supporting German troop movements in central Africa, she was unexpectedly challenged by two motor boats, named HMS Mimi and HMS Toutou, which had been transported from Britain to the lake by an expedition led by Lieutenant-Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson. The faster and more nimble motor boats were able to chase down Kingani, which was unable to bring her larger weapon to bear on the small vessels without turning to face them. After being hit several times and crippled, and with her commanding officer and several men dead, she surrendered and was brought back to the British base. Brought into British service as Fifi, she became the first German warship to be captured and transferred to the Royal Navy. Fifi went on to join the Anglo-Belgian flotilla in attacking and sinking her former consort, , after a prolonged engagement which left Fifi with only two shells remaining, before she scored a crucial hit. She supported further Allied operations on the lake, which involved working with land forces, but the flotilla did not participate in any offensive actions, and the last remaining German vessel, Graf von Götzen, was left unmolested. Fifi spent her last days as a government steamer, carrying passengers across the lake, until being scuttled as unseaworthy in 1924. Construction Kingani was one of two screw steamers constructed by Meyer-Werft in Papenburg, Germany in 1893/4 for service as customs cruisers in the German East Africa. The ships displaced (), their overall length was with a beam. An engine (one boiler with and 10 at) delivered for a maximum speed of . Crewed by one officer and seven men, the boats were armed with a revolver gun. Service Kingani served with German customs on Lake Tanganyika until 1913 when she was transferred to the Ostafrikanische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft. On 10 November 1914 she was drafted to guard Lake Tanganyika together with Hedwig von Wissmann. Strategic situation on Lake Tanganyika Kingani formed part of the small German naval flotilla on the lake, consisting initially of Kingani and the 60-ton Hedwig von Wissmann, but joined in June 1915 by the 1,200-ton Graf von Götzen. These ships had secured control of Lake Tanganyika after destroying the Belgian steamer Alexandre del Commune shortly after the start of the war, and were being used by the Germans to support their land forces in the region. German control of the lake was significant for the whole campaign in the central African theatre. While the British could muster troops to the south of the lake, and the Belgians had troops to the north, neither could push into German East Africa because of the risk that the Germans would use their boats to transport troops across the lake, and use them to cut their supply and communications lines. Sallying out of their homeport of Kigoma on the eastern side of the lake, the German vessels transported troops to carry out raids on Belgian territory, and also bombarded the Belgian port of Lukuga. In response to these raids, and needing to secure control of the lake to prevent German raids and to support their own troops in the field, the Admiralty despatched an expedition, led by Lieutenant-Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson, to transport two motor boats named HMS Mimi and HMS Toutou by sea, rail, river and road to the lake. Once there he was to sink or disable the German vessels, and secure control of the lake. After an arduous journey the two boats reached the lake and were launched on 22 and 23 December. Kingani reconnoitres The Kingani on Lake Tanganyika before being captured. The commander of the German naval forces, Captain Gustav Zimmer, had placed Lieutenant Job Rosenthal, who had served aboard the cruiser until her sinking at the Battle of Rufiji Delta, in command of Kingani. Rosenthal was ordered to investigate Belgian preparations for assembling and launching their large steamer Baron Dhanis. Rosenthal took Kingani close to Kalemie, where work was underway to construct a harbour to base Mimi and Toutou, but had to keep clear of two 12-pounder guns that were being used as shore batteries. Rosenthal returned early on 2 December and swam ashore to investigate. In doing so he discovered Mimi and Toutou, but was captured before he could return to make his report. In his absence, Sub- Lieutenant Junge took over command of Kingani. Still lacking detailed information on Belgian plans, Zimmer sent Junge to carry out a reconnaissance mission, and on 26 December Kingani again approached Kalemie. Kingani is captured Kingani was spotted from the shore, and Spicer-Simson's men quickly took to the water, cutting Kingani off from her base. Taken by surprise Junge ordered Kinganis speed to be increased, but as the six-pounder gun mounted in the forepart of Kingani could only fire forward, he was forced to circle to aim at the lead British boat, Mimi. The Germans also opened fire with rifles, as the British boats closed on Kingani. Eventually the British scored a direct hit, a three-pounder shell passing through the gunshield and killing Junge, and two petty officers, Penne and Schwarz. Several more shells hit Kingani, starting fires and flooding. With Junge dead, the chief engineer hauled down the colours and waved a white handkerchief. Mimi then approached, accidentally ramming Kingani at full speed. Toutou also came alongside, and took possession of Kingani, which was then sailed back to shore. HMS Fifi joins the flotilla Junge and four dead crewmembers were buried, and after a hole in Kinganis hull had been patched, she was taken into service as HMS Fifi. Spicer-Simson explained that Fifi meant 'tweet-tweet' in French, and was suggested by the wife of a Belgian officer who had a small caged bird. Her 6-pounder gun was moved to her stern, while one of the 12-pounder guns that had been mounted as a shore battery was fixed to the bows. The Admiralty was impressed by the expedition's achievements, Spicer-Simson was specially promoted to commander from the date of the action, and a message was sent which read \\"His Majesty The King desires to express his appreciation of the wonderful work carried out by his most remote expedition\\"; The Colonial Office also expressed its approbation. Fifi became the first German warship to be captured and brought into service with the Royal Navy. Fifi battles Hedwig It was not until mid-January that Hedwig appeared to investigate the loss of Kingani, which was assumed to have strayed within range of the shore batteries and been sunk. Hedwig returned on 8 February, having failed to learn anything significant on her first pass, and this time the British were ready. Spicer- Simson had taken command of Fifi, and supported by Mimi and two Belgian vessels, took his flotilla in pursuit. Odebrecht spotted the approaching vessels, but continued to advance. Initially mistaking them for Belgian craft, the white ensigns revealed that they were British. He continued towards the shore until making a sharp turn to port at 9.30am, either attempting to lure them toward Götzen, or having been fooled by an optical illusion into thinking the approaching vessels were larger than he had first thought. The pursuing vessels chased Hedwig, with Fifi opening fire with her bow mounted 12-pounder. The recoil stopped her dead in her tracks, Odebrecht used this to pull away. Hedwig could do to Fifis , but as Fifi fell behind, Mimi sped past, firing on the retreating German vessel with her 3-pounder gun. The shots missed, but Hedwigs stern guns did not have the range of Mimis weapon, and Odebrecht was forced to come about and try to hit her with his bow-mounted 6-pounder. The two circled for a time, unable to score hits, until Fifi closed. Spicer- Simson, commanding aboard Fifi, was down to three shells on his 12-pounder, and risked being outclassed if Hedwig could bring her own 6-pounder to bear. At this moment, the shell jammed in Fifis gun, and in the twenty minutes that it took to clear it, Hedwig again pulled away, searching for Götzen. With her second to last shot, Fifi fired again. The shell hit Hedwigs hull, causing flooding, while moments later her last shell hit the engine room, bursting the boiler and killing five African sailors and two Germans. As fires began to spread through the stricken craft Odebrecht gave the order to abandon ship, and set explosive charges to destroy the sinking vessel. The British picked up the survivors, and also captured a large German naval ensign, the first to be taken in the war. Later operations The flotilla returned to shore with their prisoners, and the following day Götzen appeared offshore, steaming slowly past in search of the missing Hedwig. Alerted, the crews rushed to man their boats, but Spicer-Simson forbade an attack. Naval operations on the lake largely ceased thereafter, and by May the Belgians were about to capture Kigoma and a British force was pushing north towards Bismarckburg. The expedition received orders to support the land operations from the lake, and the flotilla, consisting of Mimi, Toutou, Fifi and Vengeur arrived off Bismarckburg on 5 June. Finding the harbour defended by a fort, Spicer-Simson decided not to attack, and withdrew to Kituta. This allowed the German forces to escape in a fleet of dhows, an act with provoked the anger of the army commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Murray. The naval expeditionary force remained at Bismarckburg, where Spicer-Simson was chastened to learn that the fort's guns were in fact wooden dummies. Götzen was disarmed and then scuttled as the Germans withdrew from the lake and the Allies secured their supremacy on the lake. Spicer-Simson would later claim prize-money for the successful capture of Fifi. Post-war and disposal Fifi remained in service for the rest of the war, and became the government steam launch, carrying passengers and cargo from Kigoma to the southern ports on the lake on behalf of the Marine Department of the Tanganyikan government. In 1922 the fare was 2½ cents a mile for Africans, 9 cents a mile for Europeans. Considered unseaworthy by 1924, she was towed out of Kigoma and sunk in of water.

He was the captain of the 1910 team that won 17 games and lost eight under first year head coach Branch Rickey. In April 1910, he hit one of the longest home runs ever made at Ferry Field. During Enzenroth's three years as the catcher for the Wolverines, the team compiled a record of 47–15–1. Professional baseball Enzenroth at Michigan, 1920 After graduating from Michigan, Enzenroth played baseball with a semi-professional team in Chicago. In November 1913, Enzenroth signed with the St. Louis Browns of the American League. Enzenroth was re-united with Branch Rickey in St. Louis. Rickey had been Enzenroth's classmate at the University of Michigan, served as the coach of Michigan's baseball team in 1910, and was the player- manager for the Browns from 1913 to 1915. Rickey persuaded Enzenroth to leave his legal career to join the Browns in 1913. In March 1914, a newspaper profile of the Browns noted: \\"Enzenroth is a lawyer and an educated ballplayer. He hit well in the practice games and accompanied the first squad to Ft. Myers for the two game series with the Colonels, a circumstance that gave rise to the impression that he is regarded in a favorable light by those in command.\\" Enzenroth made his Major League debut with the Browns on May 1, 1914, and appeared in only three games for the team. After Enzenroth appeared in a game against the Chicago White Sox, a newspaper account noted: \\"Jack Enzenroth, Rickey's old college chum and fellow lawyer then donned the windpad and big mitt but somehow failed to deliver. He lost a shutout for Hamilton against Chicago by muffing a perfect peg to the plate.\\" In early June 1914, Enzenroth left the Browns organization after signing with the Kansas City Packers of the newly formed Federal League. Charles A. Baird, who had been the athletic director at the University of Michigan while Enzenroth was a student- athlete, was one of the co-owners of the Packers. Ezenroth appeared in 26 games for the Packers in 1914, compiling a .178 batting average. He returned to the Packers in 1915 and appeared in 14 games with a .158 batting average. Enzenroth appeared in his final Major League game on September 22, 1915. Later years In 1917, Enzenroth was living in Toledo, Ohio, and listed in the city director as a manager.Toledo City Directory, 1917, p. 383. In 1920, Enzenroth returned to the University of Michigan as the freshman baseball coach. From at least 1921 to 1929, he was listed in the Ann Arbor City Directories as a chemical engineer or chemist living in Ann Arbor with his wife Adelaide M. Enzenroth.R. L. Polk & Co.'s Ann Arbor City Directory, 1921, p. 224 (chemical engineer).Polk's Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and Washtenaw County Directory, 1922, p. 206.Polk's Ann Arbor (Michigan) Directory, 1928, p. 196.Polk's Ann Arbor (Michigan) Directory, 1929, p. 196.

It allows the Libron River, near Agde in south-west France, to traverse the Canal du Midi. At the point of intersection, the Libron is more or less at the same level as the Canal du Midi so a traditional aqueduct was not an option. The problem was further exacerbated by the Libron's propensity to flash flood up to twenty times a year. The problem was originally solved by the building of a pontoon aqueduct known as the Libron Raft which utilised a flush-decked barge to protect the canal channel in times of flooding. However, this was replaced by the present structure in 1855. History Elevation and plan of the original pontoon viaduct The Canal du Midi was opened in 1681, a year after the death of its designer and implementer Pierre-Paul Riquet. Between its opening and the creation of the Ouvrages du Libron, the Libron would periodically overflow and fill the canal with silt and debris. During periods of flooding, a special flush-walled barge would be placed in the canal, like a raft, with high walls on either end, forming a large walled area that would allow the Libron to flow over the canal without depositing its silt and trash. Canal traffic was unable to pass whilst the barge was in place and would have to wait for the flood to recede and the barge to be removed. In 1855, the Ouvrages du Libron (Works of Libron) were built to better allow the two streams to coexist. The engineer Urbain Maguès designed a structure that allowed the Libron to be directed in such a way as to allow a canal boat to safely pass and to limit the mud and debris being deposited into the canal by the flooding river. Operation The Libron can be either a dry bed, or a tranquil stream, or a torrent caused by melting snow and heavy rains. During light volume, the Libron flows through a culvert beneath the intersection. During times of heavy runoff, the Libron carries significant amounts of silt and vegetation. The surface levels of the two streams are very similar during normal circumstances. This intersection at such close levels would not allow for an aqueduct or any other usual means of passing, one stream over the other. The river bed of the Libron was modified so that the stream would split into two paths as it approached the Canal du Midi. The paths crossed the canal through the Ouvrages du Libron, consisting of six \\"gates\\" on each side of a \\"protected area\\" in length. In a flooding situation, the Libron crosses the Canal du Midi in two bodies. Each body passes through the \\"works\\" through six gates opening into six sluice bodies. Each sluice is made up of three portions of walls. The river comes into the works, when the sliding gate is up, and is bounded by the stone walls of the \\"works\\", then by walls that have been slid into place over the canal body, and finally the stone walls on the exiting side. The bed of the Libron was set close to the normal level of the surface of the Canal du Midi at the crossing. Thus the beds of the sluices across the canal lie almost on the water surface of the canal. The works allowed the river path nearest an approaching boat to be stopped for a period of time to allow a canal boat to cross through that area and rest for a time in the \\"protected area\\" between the two paths. The river path behind the boat would now be returned to flow and the path in front of the boat is halted. The boat can now cross this second path without interference. The Libron River is in the French department of Hérault in the Languedoc-Roussillon region and flows into the Mediterranean.

The statue of St. James the Major (c. 1420), by Niccolò di Piero Lamberti, once occupied the niche but is now housed in the Museum of Orsanmichele.Grifton, Nannelli, Pisetta, Giuseppe, de Yoldi and Zervas, 70, 152 Formal Analysis Placed above the tabernacle is a tondo which displays frescoed remains of the Guild's emblem.Grifton, Nannelli, Pisetta, Giuseppe, de Yoldi and Zervas, 70 Decorative cusps draw the eye upward toward the pointed tip of the gable. Still extant in the gable is a scene of The Soul of St. James Carried to Heaven by two Cherubim.Grifton, Nannelli, Pisetta, Giuseppe, de Yoldi and Zervas, 72 St. James, kneels poised and praying upon his knees. His profile position juxtaposes with two cherubins that gaze outwards as they embrace him from below. Their well-articulated wings fall smoothly down their shoulders. Their rounded, idealized faces appear youthful. Rounded triangles converge in the interior dome of the niche. Twisted colonnades flank the niche and at its base, on either side are displayed the emblem of the Guild of Furriers and Skinners. Also at the base is a relief of The Beheading of St. James. Centrally located in the panel St. James is found fallen to his knees. His head, only partially severed from his neck, drapes forward onto the ground. Five figures surround him. The niche itself no longer holds the statue of St. James the Major. The statue is instead on display in the Museum of Orsanmichele. St. James stands contrapposto with his right arm slightly drawn up. His left had holds the bible to his side. Although fully covered in drapery, the form of his lower body below the deep folds is detectable. His right thigh and knee become visible, creating the illusion that his robes are somewhat thin. They fall smoothly from his chest and gracefully onto the floor leaving only his bare toes visible. His head and face are idealized, resembling the classical philosopher style. He gazes forward in contemplation. The Guild of Furriers and Skinners L’Arte de Vaiai e Pellicciai, or, the Guild of Furriers and Skinners, joined The Seven Greater Guilds (Le Arte Maggiori) in the early 12th century. Four of the Seven Greater Guilds of Florence were already in existence when the Guild of Furriers and Skinners came into the group. Mention of their incorporation dates to 1197. At the same time, the Guild of Judges and Notaries (Arte de Giudici e Notai), and the Guild of Doctors and Apothecaries (L’Arte de Medici e Degli Speziali), joined the existing four that consisted of The Calimala Guild (L’Arte e Universita de Marcanti di Calimala), The Guild of Wool (L’ Arte e Universita della Lana), The Guild of Bankers and Money-Changers (L’Arte del Cambio), and The Guild of Silk (L’Arte della Seta, or “Por Santa Maria). The Guild of Furriers and Skinners ranked seventh in the Guild Hierarchy and may have been chosen over other lesser guilds because of a more ancient lineage, a higher social grade or its significant industrial class. In 1266, it was fully established with the Guild’s arms, Consuls and other Officers.Staley, 275-276 References Sources *Grifton, Paola, Francesca Nannelli, Claudio Pisetta, Giuseppe Coopmans de Yoldi, and Diane F.

It consists only of puff pastry with no filling or other ingredients. Despite its name, it is not blue.Blauer Kuchen, in the online Culinary Heritage of Switzerland datebase History Blue cake has been produced by Frutig valley bakeries since at least the 1900s. Up until the 1950s, however, it was only sold in colder months, when butter could be kept cold more easily, and around major holidays. As of 2000, the cake is available on weekends around the year in most bakeries, where it is one of the most important weekend pastries. Despite its name, the cake is not actually blue, and some Frutig valley bakers who were interviewed by Swiss culinary historians in the 2000s provided different explanations for the name. One such explanation was that, in the local dialect, \\"to make blue\\" (blau machen) means to take a holiday. Other bakers believe that the name refers to the faint blue tint of the uncooked dough or to the blueish, buttery steam emerging from the oven in which the cake is baked. Production Blue cake is made only by professional bakers from a dough of flour, butter, water and salt. Several layers of butter are rolled into the dough with a special rolling machine (tourage), after which the dough is cut into roundels of pastry 6 cm thick and 25 cm or more in diameter. These are cut with decorative patterns, brushed with eggs and baked at 220 °C for 20 minutes. The mostly orally transmitted recipes differ among local bakers, who as of the 2000s are producing the cake in the third or fourth generation. The amount of butter used, the time during which the dough is allowed to rest before baking (up to two days) and the baking temperature and heat all vary. Consumption Blue cake is eaten as a snack with cheese and meat or at breakfast with coffee, butter and jam. It has a light and buttery taste. The cake is mostly appreciated by Frutig Valley residents and is virtually unknown among visitors and outside the valley.

Fossils have been found from stratum 6 of the Dahuangtian locality, an outcrop of the Lower Red Beds of the Lufeng Formation in Yunnan, China.Lucas, S. G. (2001). Chinese fossil vertebrates. Columbia University Press, 375 pp. Parts of the postcranial skeleton, such as the dorsal osteoderms, vertebrae, ribs, and bones of the manus, are known.Young, C. C. (1951). The Lufeng saurischian fauna in China. Palaeontologica Sinica, New Series C 13:1-96. The dorsal osteoderms of the lumbar region are fused to double headed ribs. All osteoderms are rectangular and overlap each other. Microchampsa was named in 1951 on the basis of an incomplete skeleton consisting of cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae as well as ribs and three rows of dorsal osteoderms. Three other specimens of crocodylomorphs described in 1965 also seemed to display three rows of osteoderms, and as a result were assigned to the genus Microchampsa.Simmons, D. J. (1965). The non-therapsid reptiles of the Lufeng Basin, Yunnan, China. Fieldiana: Geology 15(1):1-93. However, later studies revealed that the specimens had only two rows of osteoderms that more closely resembled those of the genus Platyognathus, and that the presence of three rows of osteoderms in the holotype of Microchampsa may have been an artifact of preservation.Clark, J. A. (1986). Phylogenetic relationships of the crocodylomorph archosaurs. Ph. D. dissertation. University of Chicago, Chicago. 1-556. However, this hypothesis is speculative as the holotype of Microchampsa had since been lost by the time of the studies.Luo, Z. and Wu, X.-C. (1994). The small tetrapods of the lower Lufeng Formation, Yunnan, China. In: Fraser, F. C. and Sues, H.-D. In the Shadow of the Dinosaurs: Early Mesozoic Tetrapods Cambridge University Press, pp. 251-270. It was assigned to the suborder Protosuchia in 1965 and the family Notochampsidae in 1992. However, later studies argued that it is a nomen dubium due to the lack of diagnostic material in the incompletely known remains.Wu, X. C. and Sues, H. D.

Note the blank wall space. Rossetti's design for Sir Lancelot's Vision of the Holy Grail The Oxford Union murals (1857–1859) are a series of mural decorations in the Oxford Union library building. The series was executed by a team of Pre-Raphaelite artists including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. The paintings depict scenes from Arthurian myth. The murals were commissioned by John Ruskin and the subject was probably chosen as a result of earlier Pre- Raphaelite interest in Arthurian themes, such as the illustrations to Edward Moxon's 1857 edition of Tennyson.Richard W. Barber, The Holy Grail: imagination and belief, Harvard University Press, 2004, p.267. In addition to Rossetti, Morris and Burne-Jones, several other artists agreed to contribute. These were the painters Val Prinsep, Arthur Hughes, J. H. Pollen, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope and the sculptor Alexander Munro.Clare A. P. Willsdon, Mural painting in Britain 1840-1940: image and meaning, Oxford University Press, 2004, p.258. A close up of Jane Burden, later Morris, in Rossetti's Sir Lancelot's Vision of the Holy Grail The murals compete with the light from the windows The process of painting the murals was notoriously chaotic. Ruskin said that the artists were \\"all the least bit crazy and it's very difficult to manage them.\\" As the murals were painted directly onto the wall without plaster or adequate underpainting they began to suffer decay very quickly. William Morris later completely repainted his design for the ceiling. Rossetti's main work was Sir Lancelot's Vision of the Holy Grail. Burne-Jones painted Nimue brings Sir Peleus to Ettarde after their Quarrel. Morris executed Sir Palomides' jealousy of Sir Tristram and Iseult, though his work has been described as “poorly and clumsily painted, but the background of leaves and flowers” revealed his skills in design.C. Wood, The Pre- Raphaelites, London: Seven Dials, 1981, p. 110 A view of the murals of the Oxford Union Society Library at night time Jane Burden, who would later marry William Morris, first appears as a model in the Oxford murals. Burden was noticed by Rossetti and Burne-Jones when she was visiting an Oxford theatre with her sister. Struck by Jane's beauty, they sought her to model for them. In 1906 Rossetti's Pre-Raphaelite colleague William Holman Hunt, who had not been directly involved, wrote a book on the history of the decorations.

It was also one of the first buildings in Manchester to house telephone lines, and was once \\"the headquarters for the movement to license the sale of 'spirituous beverages'.\\" It began as a tavern in 1790 called The Stagecoach Inn, before becoming Lockwood's Hotel circa 1850. In 1860, the building was renamed Thayer's Hotel by the new owner, Steven Thayer. It became the Fairview Hotel in 1902 and, in 1934, it was a hotel and antique shop run by the new owner Walter Clemons. In 1975, it was renamed Ye Olde Tavern by Peter and Susan Palmer, who renovated the place in time for the 1976 United States Bicentennial.

Main characters Empowered :Empowered is a female member of the Superhomeys superhero group and the titular character of the Empowered graphic novel series. Empowered's civilian name is Elissa Megan Powers, but is most commonly referred to by her fellow heroes and friends as “Emp”. Whether this is purely because of it being a shortened reference to her superhero name, or simply a phonetic pronunciation of her civilian name initials is not specified. :Emp is a 20-something super heroine and associate-member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Her powers and abilities are derived from a super suit of unknown origin and nature (the suit literally \\"fell out of the sky\\" in an envelope addressed to her). This suit, while being Emp’s source of power, has also made her a social laughingstock as it often fails her when she needs it the most. This is due to the suit’s material, known as a “hyper membrane”, being incredibly thin and incredibly skin-tight, while also being extremely fragile and sometimes uncooperative. :Despite these shortcomings, Empowered’s super suit has steadily become more useful and resilient with new abilities being revealed as the series progresses. Additionally, Emp’s suit has been implied to have been bonded specifically to her, and has been shown to be completely useless when worn by other people. The suit's odd behaviour and contradictory properties (such as being able to stop bullets and shark bites, yet also extremely fragile) are at least partially a result of Elissa's psychological difficulties and limitations.Empowered Vol. 7, Page 180 :Emp’s super suit imparts both voluntary powers, controlled intentionally by the wearer, and involuntary powers; passive abilities that become active without conscious intent of the wearer, and physical attributes that do not necessarily enhance the function of the suit but are active nonetheless. :Voluntary Abilities of Empowered’s Super suit :*Superhuman strength. Emp herself describes her physical strength, while the suit is undamaged, as approximating that of 10 fit men.Empowered Vol. 1, Page 64 :*Invisibility. This ability is purely voluntary, but the invisibility effect does not extend to the wearer, essentially making Emp appear nude whenever she tries to use it.Empowered Vol.1, page 182 & 183 It is also possible for Emp to make sections of the suit turn invisible while other sections remain visible. This ability was advantageous for her to trick dWARf/Fleshmaster into allowing her into the back-stage control room from which he was sabotaging the proceedings of the Caped Justice Awards ceremony.Empowered Vol. 4, page 175, 178 & 179, 182-185 :*Various visual enhancements including magnification and x-ray vision.Empowered Vol. 2, page 184&185 These visual enhancements remain usable even if the suit has been damaged to the point that all other voluntary powers have ceased functioning. :*The ability to cling to all surfaces.Empowered Vol. 5, page 11-15 Emp discovered this power accidentally when she was flung to the underside of the outstretched hand of a large statue.Empowered Vol. 4, page 169&170 This may be a form of dispersive adhesion. :*High-intensity directed energy discharges. Emp has marginal control of these energy blasts, and varying ability to aim them. She has improved in this area as the series has progressed, but this has not deterred the foes that she faces, nor does it seem to discourage the frequency by which Emp is captured. However, her ability to use this power became markedly more accurate when Thugboy was in danger of death.Empowered Vol. 1, page 192 Also, there may be a secondary, and far more powerful \\"mode\\" to this ability that manifests itself without Emp's awareness. :*Fragments of the hyper membrane seem to obey the wishes of Emp, even after being torn away from the main body of the suit. This was demonstrated when Emp nearly killed a villain called Lone Gunman. She used a large portion of her suit’s material to block Lone Gunman’s air passages, but managed to coax the material into pulling out of his mouth and nose with a verbal request.Empowered Vol. 2, page 81 :*The suit can place phone calls when the wearer makes a telephone hand-sign. The voluntary abilities of Emp’s suit are usually lost when too much of the suit’s fragile material is ripped away. Despite this often-exploited drawback, Empowered’s suit also has many abilities that are not directly controlled, and usually remain functional. :Automatic functions :*Damage Protection. The suit is able to absorb or deflect all damage that may be directed at it while leaving Emp unharmed. This has been demonstrated with gunfire,Empowered Vol. 1, page 16Empowered Vol. 2, page 77 various bladed weapons,Empowered Vol. 1, page 95Empowered Vol. 2, page 159Empowered Vol. 5, page 197 blunt impacts,Empowered Vol. 1, pages 22, 110 & 111Empowered Vol. 2, page 22Empowered Vol. 3, page 12Empowered Vol. 4, pages 15, 58 & 169Empowered Vol. 5, page 16 & 17 and even a shark bite.Empowered Vol. 1, page 113 Although, this usually leaves the suit itself greatly damaged, Emp has never been subject to bodily harm in the process, with a single exception during a confrontation with a mind-controlled Ninjette wielding a magic katana, who was able to wound her.Empowered Vol. 11, pages 183 & 188 :*Suit Regeneration. The suit is capable of self-repair, however, very slowly. This appears to somehow be tied to Emp’s sexual activity, or possibly her emotional state.Empowered Vol. 4, page 141 and it has been implied that Emp has become something of a sexual deviant since she began using the suit. :*Vacuum Support. The suit can protect Empowered while exposed to outer space, seemingly keeping her body pressurized, protected from extreme temperatures, shielded from ambient radiation, and allowing her to breathe as if in normal atmosphere.Empowered Vol. 5, page 21 & 22 This can happen despite the suit being damaged in several places, exposing Emp’s bare skin. :*Powered- up Independent Action. The suit can manifest structures somewhat resembling the skeleton of a bat's wings, enabling Emp to hover. At the same time, when manifesting this \\"skeletal\\" wings, the suit can shoot wide-radius energy blasts that are incredibly more powerful and damaging that Emp's normal discharges. Emp is unaware of this ability, as the suit apparently was mind- controlling her the only time it was used. :In addition to voluntary and involuntary abilities, the suit also has some functions and attributes that are active regardless of the person interacting with the material of the hyper membrane. :*The suit can “knit” itself around the hair follicles on Empowered’s scalp, giving the appearance that the cowl of the suit is really an accessory mask.Empowered Vol. 2, page 142 This may be one of the only abilities of the suit that is not reliant on Emp being the user as this occurred with a male wearer of the suit who stole it from Emp in an attempt to gain the suit’s powers.Empowered Vol. 1, page 27-29 :*The suit can greatly accentuate the sensations from sexual stimulation.Empowered Vol. 2, page 143 & 144 It is not clear if this effect can be experienced by anyone, as long as Emp is involved,Empowered Vol. 2, page 150 or if this is another example of the suit having a passive effect on anybody. :*The suit sometimes acts autonomously, taking on the physical dimensions of Emp without her actually wearing it. The only character shown to interact with the suit while it does this is the extraterrestrial/supernatural energy being/symbiote that is trapped within alien bondage gear commonly referred to as “The Caged Demonwolf”.Empowered Vol. 3, page 116Empowered Vol. 5, page 49 :Because Empowered is only an associate member of the Superhomeys, her participation with the group is limited in scope and something akin to “part-time”, so she still has a day job. Her first day job consisted of wearing a mascot costume for a discount retail store called “Value Mammoth”, advertising the store’s sales with a picket sign.Empowered Vol.1, page 37&38 This job earned her much disrespect and derision from passersby. Eventually, Emp lost this job when she accidentally destroyed the store in an attempt to defeat a massive Ammonoidea- like monster as it rampaged through the city.Empowered Vol.1, page 46-49 :For an interminable period, it is implied that Emp took a job at a restaurant known as P.J. McJiggles, Food and Hotness.Empowered Vol.1, page 59 :Afterward, Emp moved on to cosplaying as her costumed self in a licensed troupe of Superhomeys imitators known as “The Superhomeys Experience”. In this impersonation of herself, she wears a PVC imitation of her hyper membrane supersuit. During her performances, she affects a comically heavy Southern accent in order to encourage onlookers to not recognize her as being the actual Empowered.Empowered Vol.1, page 121-124 In this she was successful until she was forced to reveal herself when the troupe was abducted by Anglerfish in an attempt to force the Superhomeys to investigate Willy Pete.Empowered Vol.5, page 85-106 :Emp is in a heavily sexual relationship with her Japanese-American boyfriend, only referred to as “Thugboy”. Previous to meeting Emp, Thugboy spent the majority of his adult career as a henchperson to many different supervillains. However, after meeting Emp, he has given up his life of criminal-assistance to largely act as emotional and physical support for Emp as she struggles with her insecurities. This support frequently manifests in the form of sex, which may be beneficial to Emp’s suit as well as her emotional state since the former seems to mirror the latter. :Emp's relationships with other superheroes and the general public are complex: despite the Superhomeys generally having nothing but contempt and pity, if not outright mockery for her long list of shortcomings (exacerbated, after the Willy Pete fiasco, by the outright hatred and blame Major Havoc keeps pouring on her for the death of his friends), it's implied Empowered has appeal on the large public. :It's in fact implied by Maid Man that while the other superheroes are often seen as cold, aloof and self-aggrandizing superpowered beings oblivious to the damages they bring around, and detached from humanity, Empowered bridges the gap by blatantly showing her human failures and shortcomings.Empowered Vol.6 However, while Empowered may be liked as a person, as a superheroine she is still considered somewhat of a trashy oddball, whose feminine physique is the only credit to her career. Thugboy :Thugboy is a male former-career criminal, boyfriend of Emp, and the remaining member of the former Witless Minions. So far, Thugboy’s true name has not been revealed, and no other characters have been shown to ask him about this. Although Thugboy had previously been a career criminal, he quickly gave up his life of crime to become somewhat of a protector and primary supporter of Emp in her efforts to become a worthwhile superhero. :Before meeting Emp, Thugboy was the nominal leader of the Witless Minions, a gang of comrades that made a living through being hired by aspiring supervillains for the eventual purpose of bankrupting them by stealing their equipment and selling it for personal profit. He also briefly worked for a white supremacist supervillain named \\"Super Caucasian\\", but was swiftly fired for being half- Japanese. Eventually, this scheme went awry when they became employed by Willy Pete. Rather than driving Willy Pete into bankruptcy and forcing him to give up his schemes due to a lack of funding and support, it incensed Willy Pete so much that he decided to track down and kill every last member of the Witless Minions. In this, Willy Pete was nearly successful; after having sodomized every other Witless Minion, Willy Pete was temporarily incapacitated by being frozen. This afforded Thugboy the necessary time to escape. :Since the demise of the Witless Minions, and until he first met Emp, Thugboy lived his life with no regard for his own well being, often showing no fear in the face of imminent danger or death. However, upon meeting Emp, Thugboy became amorously obsessed and eventually gave up his career or misdeed to become Empowered's \\"White Knight\\". Since then, Emp and Thugboy's relationship has been implicitly sexual and emotionally supportive; sometimes, these two manifest as the same thing. Thugboy's admiration for Emp is so great that usually an entire chapter in every volume of the Empowered series is devoted to the various aspects of his enamor. :Despite Thugboy giving up his criminality, he still retains a love (and proficiency) for firearms. So far in his post-minion lifestyle, he has been shown using a Barrett M82A1 .50 caliber sniper rifle, a Ruger SP-101, and a Ruger P series semi-automatic handgun. During the Caped Justice Awards ceremony he also used Single Action's weapons.Empowered Vol.4, page 179 :Thugboy holds a dark secret from Emp that has been occasionally mentioned - \\"The San-Antonio incident\\". Although not dealt with explicitly, it has been implied at various points throughout the comic run that Thugboy was involved in a Cape Killing militia - thus going against the unspoken rules that exist between Heroes and Villains in the Empowered universe. Empowered, in her capacity as the story narrator, explicitly acknowledges that in the introduction to volume 6, and in the same issue Thugboy, showing uneasiness in attending at the funeral services for the latest victims of Willy Pete, flashes back to himself planning a superhero massacre during a funeral in San Antonio, strongly implied to be the San Antonio Incident itself. Kozue Kaburagi, aka Ninjette :Kozue Kaburagi, who is more commonly referred to as \\"Ninjette\\" or simply \\"'Jette\\", is a highly skilled ninja and princess of the Kaburagi ninja clan, based out of New Jersey. Although Ninjette is either a second or third-generation Japanese-American with a strongly Caucasoid appearance, her family name is intended to be traditionally Japanese. :Despite being a princess of the Kaburagi ninja clan, Ninjette ran away from her clan and has been in hiding for several years so as to avoid being forced into a life of servitude to the clan by continually giving birth to high-blooded clan members. She met Emp in the usual way - i.e., Emp getting captured once again -, but when her thugs failed to show up to collect her captive, the two women went into the next bar for a drinking rout and became fast friends. Kozue subsequently moved in with Emp and Thugboy and has been a close friend to both ever since. :Furthermore, while being more competent and skilled than Emp, Kozue carries even deeper insecurities than her friend, stemming by her apparent role of a breeding mare for her clan, and bolstered by the continued berating she suffered in her childhood for her presumed lack of skills in respect of her clansfolk. Until volume 4 and 5, when she was forced to openly confront the issue, she always kept herself on the brink of alcoholism, as a way to silence the voices in her head. As such, she also keeps using, in a comical way, her ninja skills to improve (apparently with a certain success) her self-image, having techniques for simulating a tipsy mindframe or give herself a sexy sway. In addition, she took emulating Elissa in her \\"civilian\\" life, reasoning that while as Ninjette she may look more charismatic and seductive than Empowered, as Kozue she believes Elissa more naturally beautiful than her. Through out the series, Ninjette has a growing sexual attraction towards Thug Boy, Emp's boyfriend, once when Thug boy had accidentally groped her in bed, mistaking her for Emp, she blushed, and another time when she made-out with a member of her clan, disguised as Thug Boy, despite knowing it wasn't him, she refuses to act on her feelings out of respect for her friend. Heroes Dr. Big McLarge Huge :Dr. Big McLarge Huge is a superhuman doctor at the Superhuman Wing of the Purple Paladin Memorial hospital.Empowered Vol. 4, page 21&22 Big McLarge Huge is named as such because of his massive stature and physique. Although he is larger than most of the humanoid superheroes and villains in the Empowered series, his given profession is as a physician and surgeon, specializing in the treatment of critical wounds and maladies that seem to be common in the superhero profession.Empowered Vol. 4, Page 22 While Dr. McLarge Huge appears to be a dedicated physician, he is still upset that he has never been nominated for a Caped Justice award, and deems such injustice as a misplacement of priorities within the superhero community.Empowered Vol. 4, page 24&25 :While in attendance of the Caped Justice Awards, and the subsequent sabotage of the ceremonies, Dr. Big McLarge Huge ingested some of the food that had been tainted with Wet Blanket’s flesh, the result of which reverted him to a much smaller form, indicating that his largeness is not a natural attribute.Empowered Vol. 4, page 165&166 :Dr. Big McLarge Huge's name comes from a comment made during the Space Mutiny episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Capitan Rivet :Capitan (sic) Rivet is the nominal leader of the super-powered crime fighters known as the “Superhomeys”. Capitan Rivet’s attributes are largely unknown aside from some visual clues given in the various battles that the character has participated in. In several instances Capitan Rivet appears to be a hollow suit of armor, as he has been rent in half,Empowered Vol.4, page 164 had parts of the armor pulled away,Empowered Vol. 1, page 105 or been deeply dentedEmpowered Vol. 1, page 103 without ill effect to the contents or user of the armor, however, a pair of glowing eyes is always visible through the eye-holes in the armored head of the suit. :Despite being considered a leader of the Superhomeys (as well as one of the few members who don't mock Empowered), he is sometimes ineffectual in enforcing rules of conduct in the group’s members. As a result, the group is prone to cattiness and openly ostracizes Empowered and other “associate members” of the group.Empowered Vol. 5, page 37&38 :Capitan Rivet has also been accused of having been involved in the Kennedy assassination, in a malicious Wikipedia edit.Empowered Vol. 1, p. 238 Captain Katana :Captain Katana is a male human superhero whose limbs have been severed at the knees and elbows and replaced with Katanas on mechanical joints. Additionally, he has a magical Katana running through the top of his head and, presumably, down his neck and spine. Despite this, he normally suffers no ill effects or even pain. The only exception to this came with the incident at the Caped Justice Awards, in which whatever was suppressing the pain of the magical sword running through his body was negated by the power-nullifying effects of the catered food that was tainted with the flesh of Wet Blanket.Empowered Vol.4, page 157 Rendered powerless and in pain, Captain Katana suffered damage from the rampaging alien organs.Empowered Vol.4, page 163 :Despite this, he did survive the ordeal and was later killed in his participation in an attempt to ambush and defeat Willy Pete.Empowered Vol.5, page 159 After his death his gravestone is seen during Irresistimmovable attack on the Shambhala-like Suprahuman Mausoleum, along with several other dead suprahumans.Empowered Special (2009), page 1 Divangelic :Divangelic is a pair of female entities; a demon named Vanity and an angel named CharityEmpowered Vol.5, page 158 of nearly identical appearance who are conjoined at the shoulder. They are members of the Superhomeys superhero group. Divangelic, in following their biblical theme, is capable of flight through use of one feathery stereotypically angelic wing and one bat-like demon wing. The two entities of Divangelic also wield weapons individually; Vanity, a bullwhip with a sort of energy cracker, and Charity with a type of smooth headed Morning Star with glowing energy ports instead of spikes.Empowered Vol.5, page 153 Divangelic was killed in their participation in the Superhomeys' failed attempt to ambush Willy Pete. dWARf! :dWARf! is a senior member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Not much is known about his powers or skills due to him being rarely shown in battle, except for one instance when the Superhomeys were attacked by a group of pirate-themed technology developers known as \\"A.R.R.\\", or \\"Advanced Restraint Research\\".Empowered Vol.3, page 98 He likely possesses superhuman strength, as he was shown to be able to carry a container larger than himself above his head without apparent difficulty.Empowered Vol.4, page 131 :dWARf! was once another super-powered costumed hero known as “Fleshmaster”. During his time as Fleshmaster, he was a highly unpopular associate-level hero with low-level gene-altering abilities.Empowered Vol.4, pages 182&183 His career as this persona ended shortly after his humiliation at the hands of his fellow heroes during the Caped Justice Awards ceremonies. :After the disappearance of Fleshmaster, dWARf! debuted and became popular amongst the senior members of the Superhomeys. Despite his newfound popularity with this new persona, dWARf!/Fleshmaster decided to exact revenge against his former tormentors-turned-friends when he became aware of a plan to humiliate Emp in much the same manner that he had been.Empowered Vol.4, page 183 In doing this he sabotaged the Caped Justice Awards ceremony by tainting the catered food with liquefied flesh from the former supervillain known as Wet Blanket. The flesh of Wet Blanket, who exudes a superpower-nullifying effect from every cell, caused the majority of the attending heroes to temporarily lose their powers.Empowered Vol.4, page 153-205 To this, he introduced a massive, autonomous, extraterrestrial kidney that filters waste with coherent light,Empowered Vol.4, pages 165&166 and an even larger extraterrestrial “pseudo-liver” that was removed from a being because of an infestation of human-sized parasitic creatures.Empowered Vol.4 pages 163-166 dWARf!’s plot was found out and he was then defeated by Emp before any of the de-powered heroes were killed.Empowered Vol.4, pages 182-189 After his defeat at the hands of Emp, dWARf! was taken by the terminally ill and xenobiologically enhanced super-genius 11-year-old, Manny, in the hopes of using dWARf!’s gene- altering powers to devise a treatment for the cancer that is threatening his life.Empowered Vol.4, page 190&191 Femifist :Femifist is a female, costumed, news reporter for the Hero Network. She was the field reporter present at the Caped Justice Awards ceremony that was sabotaged by dWARf!.Empowered Vol.4, page 148 Femifist's superhuman abilities or attributes, if any, have not been demonstrated, but she did mention a loss of “fisting power” when she was affected by the catered food at the awards ceremony that had been tainted with the flesh of Wet Blanket.Empowered Vol.4, page 159 Heavy Artillery :Heavy Artillery is a male member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Heavy Artillery appears to be a human who has, at some point, had his head and neck completely replaced with some sort of mounted artillery gun. :Heavy Artillery is also shown to be openly gay.Empowered Vol.3, page 155 Homunculoid :Homunculoid is a posthuman male member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Homunculoid's powers have not been explicitly defined, but he seems to possess enhanced senses, perhaps due to his enlarged facial features and oversized hands, which appear similar to a sensory homunculus figure, which represents the density of sensory nerves in parts of the body. In particular, when the Superhomeys attempted to ambush Willy Pete in his hideout he could tell the burn marks on the floor were freshEmpowered Vol.5, page 154 and was able to smell Willy Pete's presence before he actually appeared.Empowered Vol.5, page 157 :Through psychic insights revealed by the super heroine Mindfuck, Homunculoid was revealed to be a womanizer and had sexual interest in Ninjette. :Homunculoid was incinerated in the Superhomeys' attempt to capture Willy Pete. Jugganaut :Jugganaut is a female, costumed heroine whose outfit intentionally draws attention to her large breasts. Jugganaut was shown briefly being interviewed at the Caped Justice Awards.Empowered Vol.4, page 150 Previous to that, she was referenced by Emp as an example of a female hero that tries to capitalize on her sexual appeal.Empowered Vol.1, page 141 Makro :Makro is a female, costumed heroine wearing a slightly armored jumpsuit, and wielding some degree of superstrength and endurance, hosting the Superdirty Jobs show on the HeroNET. As such, she is tasked to find the heroes doing the less glamorous jobs, away from the limelight (from mere steel workers tasked with the manufacture of enhanced materials to hunters of exotic/alien species), telling of their exploits to the large public. Her name is a play on the name of Mike Rowe, the host of real-life TV show Dirty Jobs. Mindfuck :Mindfuck is a female human member of the Superhomeys superhero group and possessor of very powerful psychic abilities. Her abilities are so great that her primary mode of communication is through telepathy. Although, this mode of communication is more of a necessity than a choice as, at some point in the past, she was psychically possessed by her brother and “puppeted” into cutting out her own tongue and eyes.Empowered Vol.5, page 77 Despite this, she has managed to adapt through use of a cybernetic visor that affords her vision, and in cases where her visor has been damaged beyond use, she can “piggyback” others by tapping into their Sensorium.Empowered Vol.5, page 75 :Though Mindfuck is a very powerful psychic, gifted in telepathy as well as a form of telepresence of the mind's eye,Empowered Vol.5, page 76 she was not fully able to control or filter her perceptions when in large crowds.Empowered Vol.5, page 74 As a result, Mindfuck took up residence aboard the Joint Superteam Space Station 3,Empowered Vol.5, page 23 colloquially referred to as “The D10” for its resemblance to a 10-sided die, to distance herself as much as possible from what she termed as the “babbleroar” on Earth as well as to take custodianship of the Lotus Portal Network.Empowered Vol.5, page 35 Another consequence of her being forced to communicate telepathically, while being unable to filter her thought stream, was that she could not lie or be deceptive. While she could read the unfiltered thought streams of others, it was still possible for her to be deceived by persons with some types of psychosis as well as individuals with strong delusions.Empowered Vol.5, page 34 :For some time, Mindfuck was in a pseudo-sexual relationship with Sistah Spooky. This is despite Mindfuck’s physical appearance in approximating the “Aryan ideal of shoulder candy”;Empowered Vol.4, page 200 an attribute that Sistah Spooky identifies as her reasons for hating Emp.Empowered Vol.2, pages 70, 74&75 Mindfuck and Sistah Spooky’s relationship mainly consisted of Mindfuck placating and assuring Sistah Spooky of her attractiveness and occasionally engaging in psychically facilitated metaphysical sexual intercourse. Despite Mindfuck’s assurances that she truly loved Sistah Spooky, mentally as well as physically, Sistah Spooky broke off their relationship by asserting that Mindfuck shared some common attributes with her brother.Empowered Vol.5, pages 80&81 :For the majority of Volume 5, Mindfuck became a friend and advisor to Emp, who had recently come under scrutiny from her Superhomey colleagues following the events of the Caped Justice Awards. Mindfuck perished by the end of Volume 5 when the Joint Superteam Space Station, upon which she was the sole inhabitant, was destroyed by atmospheric immolation; the result of the Superhomeys underestimating Willy Pete in their attempt to ambush and defeat him.Empowered Vol.5, pages 158-193 After her death she receives a gravestone in the Shambhala-like Suprahuman Mausoleum, along with several other dead suprahumans. Maid Man :Maid Man is a lone superhero who dresses and uses weapons thematically designed to imply he is a French Maid or housekeeper. His personality, manner of speech, attitude towards crime, fighting style and weaponry, all spoof Batman. This is repeatedly used for injokes (ie, when asked if a burly man like him doesn't feel ridiculous dressing in a flimsy French Maid costume, he replies that he would feel much more embarrassed dressing as an animal, like a bat). Unlike the majority of superheroes in the Empowered series, Maid Man does not have any superhuman abilities. Despite this, he is well liked within the milieu of superheroes and is extremely capable of defending himself and others against beings with superhuman abilities. Maid Man is also one of the few heroes who treats Emp with respect and gives her salient advice. Initially introduced as a minor/background character, he takes on a leading role alongside Emp and her other friends in Volume 6. :Emp first met Maid Man when he infiltrated the super-villain group known as the “Felonifive” under a false supervillain identity known as “Crowquet”.Empowered Vol.4, pages 56-71 :As Maid Man had no actual superhuman powers to remove in the first place, he was one of the few unaffected heroes present at the Caped Justice Awards fiasco.Empowered vol4. pages 176&181 :As shown in his first appearance in Vol 6, there is the possibility that Maid Man is a multiple personality disorder sufferer, and his civilian alter ego is unaware of the specifics of what happens when he switches over. Major Havoc :A senior member of the Superhomeys superhero group, Major Havoc usually plays a large role in the various endeavors of the group. Because of his relative importance, Major Havoc is a braggart and somewhat of a simpleton. His standard attack phrase is \\"'Scuse me while I cry 'Havoc'!\\" :Major Havoc is a womanizer and is unapologetic about it.Empowered Vol.1, page 61 On a few occasions, Major Havoc has used his seniority to exploit the Superhomeys resources and trick Emp into sexual situations, both public and private,Empowered Vol.3, pages 103-114 so that he may gratify himself to the images.Empowered Vol.3, page 107Empowered Vol.2, page 93 Also, as Emp’s career as a superheroine has continued, Major Havoc has become more vocal in his disapproval of Emp’s abilities as a hero. This culminated in him leading the other, more senior, members of the Superhomeys to become suspicious of Emp’s involvement in the Caped Justice Awards debacle.Empowered Vol.5, pages 32-35 :Major Havoc’s powers are not specifically mentioned, although he appears to possess superhuman strength and a high level of invulnerability to physical damage. Although his abilities have allowed him some degree of acclaim, these powers have not prevented him from being utterly defeated on at least a few occasions.Empowered Vol.4, page 14Empowered Vol.1, page 103 His fighting ability has been described as “like a developmentally-disabled 3rd grader” by Ninjette, and indeed has been shown to consist of straightforward punches and strikes.Empowered Vol.1, pages 186&187 :Major Havoc is one of the \\"one and a halfEmpowered Vol.5, page 186\\" survivors of the Superhomey's botched attempt to ambush Willy Pete due to his relative proximity to Turbobrain and his telekinetic fire shield as well as his own physical resilience. In fact, while Turbobrain received horrifical burns on his whole body, Major Havoc came out largely unscathed, with burns on his legs and arms, caused by his attempts to carry the still burning Turbobrain to safety, blaming Empowered for their fate. Mechzacouatl :Mechzacouatl is a large mechanized serpent with feathery wings,Empowered Vol.1, page 176 and a member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Mechzacouatl has been seen used as transportation on occasion. Although he has never been shown to speak, a one sided telephone conversation with Captain Rivet demonstrates that he can.Empowered, Soldier of Love, issue 1 :Mechzacouatl’s name is a portmanteau of Mecha and a misspelling of Quetzalcoatl. Ocelotina :Ocelotina is a female costumed performer who acts the part of a super heroine despite a complete lack of super powers, remarkable skills, or special technologies to support this appearance. Rather, her status and popularity appears to stem almost entirely from her self- promotion through “how-to” videos of dubious contentEmpowered Vol.3, page 141 and product endorsements.Empowered Vol.3, page 145 :As is implied by her assumed pseudonym, Ocelotina’s theme is based upon the Ocelot. Her costume features cat ears, clawed gloves, lingerie stockings, knee-high high heeled boots, a body appliqué that prominently exposes her cleavage through an opening shaped like a feline head, and false glowing “eyes” applied to the inner surface of her breasts to simulate cat eyes.Empowered Vol.3, page 136 She also affects feline sounds that she utters after some of her sentences. :In her earliest appearances in the Empowered series, before she had taken on her costumed persona, she had been taken hostage by a group of thugs.Empowered Vol.1, page 67 Emp attempted to rescue her, but failed and was taken captive as well when she accidentally damaged her hyper membrane suit in an attempt at a dramatic entrance through a skylight window.Empowered Vol.1, page 66 Later, the would-be Ocelotina staged another hostage taking of herself with the assistance of her brother. This ruse was set as a trap for Emp as their plan was to ransom her back to the Superhomeys.Empowered Vol.2, pages 54-68 Sistah Spooky promptly foiled this plot, but not before Emp was almost completely denuded of her suit at the hands of the would-be Ocelotina as a measure to ensure it would not grow back too soon and provide her a means of escape.Empowered Vol.3, pages 63&68-74 Phallik :Phallik is a male member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Although he was featured in every volume of the Empowered series, his status within the Superhomeys was never defined as either “Senior” or “Associate”, it was only during the 6th volume that it would be revealed he held a senior position, later defined as being the Superhomey's rep on the Joint Superteam Commission On Superdead Issues, the ambassador between the dead bargainers and the still alive heroes Empowered Vol6. page38 Phallik's superpowers seemed to revolve solely around his mighty “Phallospear” he carried with him, and his powers did appear to be drained alongside other heroes that were affected by the tainted food at the Caped Justice Awards. This loss of power manifested in his phallus-like weapon suddenly becoming limp. :Phallik was killed in his participation in the failed attempt by the Superhomeys to ambush and defeat Willy Pete. He was then revealed to be a bargainer, a superhero owing his powers to a bargain with a mystical, immortal being. As such, his charred corpse has sprung back to life, in a zombie-like fashion, dependant from his Phallospear to survive, getting into Deathmonger's service. Empowered posthumously wielded the Phallospear to free him, and the other bargainers, from eternal slavery, and later gained his role in the Superdead commission. Protean :Protean is a posthuman member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Protean is a semisolid mass of matter that has been rendered into his current state by the effects of an extraterrestrial STD.Empowered vol.1, page 174-176 Despite this change in his physiology, he has retained his intelligence and personality, and despite not having any distinguishable body parts besides hollow glowing “eyes”, he retains all of his normal senses and is even able to speak.Empowered Vol.1, pages 52-57 Previously, Protean’s given superhero pseudonym was “Glorpp”.Empowered Vol.1, page 57 Despite his colleagues’ unwillingness to call him as such, and the frequency that it is misspoken as “protein”, he still tries to correct anybody that does not call him as such. :Protean’s method of combat is to overwhelm his opponents with his body mass to restrict movement.Empowered Vol.1, page 51 :Although an extraterrestrial STD induced his current physiology, he does not appear to pass on this infectious agent through contact with his mass. Purple Paladin :The Purple Paladin was a male hero that is greatly revered by the other characters within the Empowered series. His exploits are not prominently mentioned, but whatever he had done, he is memorialized by having the city’s hospital named after him.Empowered Vol.4, page 23 Q Girl :Q Girl is shown as an alliterative example when Emp complains about the drawbacks of her hyper membrane super suit not functioning properly if she wears a cape to cover her behind. Q Girl is shown with a self-satisfied smile as her hero costume features a cape that neatly covers her own behind.Empowered Vol.1, page 142 Red Griffon :Red Griffon is a male, costumed, hero that was only mentioned as a comparison to Emp’s bravado in her attempts at heroism. Thugboy indicated that Red Griffon would probably not have as great a reputation if his armor were as fragile as the hyper-membrane suit that Emp wears.Empowered Vol.1, page 79 Robotomy :Robotomy is a mechanical humanoid member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Robotomy is an artificial being that appears to be capable of independent thought and actions. Robotomoy’s gender, if any, is not revealed. However, it is inferred that Robotomy is attracted to female humanoid buttocks, as it is seen commenting on the behinds of Emp as well as staring at the behind of Vanity, of Divangelic.Empowered Vol.1, pages 139&143Empowered Vol.5, page 156 Robotomy perished in the failed ambush of Willy Pete. Scarlet Succubus :The Scarlet Succubus is a female, costumed heroine that has not been shown within the Empowered series thus far. However, she was mentioned by Emp as an example of a female superhero that deliberately wears minimal clothing in an attempt to appear sexy. Single Action :Single Action is a male member of the Superhomeys superhero group whose theme is reminiscent of the Old West. He dresses in the manner of a traditional cowboy, complete with cowboy hat, boots, and riding chaps, as well as a pair of protective goggles.Empowered Vol.4, page 149 His superhero moniker is derived from his trademark weapons; a pair of laser-pistols that resemble single-action Colt 1851 Navy Revolvers.Empowered Vol4. page 165 Although it is anachronistic, that he himself recognizes, to have laser pistols that require hand cocking of a hammer, he uses them because he thinks that they are “plumb cool”.Empowered Vol.4, page 177 :A beam of coherent light from the alien kidney that was used to sabotage the Caped Justice Awards injured Single Action, which rendered him unable to fight.Empowered Vol.4, page 165 Fortunately, Thugboy, who had been accompanying Emp to the awards ceremony, was able to take up Single Action's weapons and assist in subduing the alien organs that were endangering the de- powered heroes. Sistah Spooky :Sistah Spooky is a female member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Unlike the majority of other superheroes in the group, her powers are derived from supernatural demonic sources. This was facilitated by a demon that had been providing preternatural augmentation of physical appearance to the girls in her high school in exchange for their immortal souls.Empowered Vol.1, pages 166-169 Then known as Theresa, Spooky was looked down upon for her appearance differing from the rest of the supernaturally idealized blondes that appeared to be the status quo of the school.Empowered Vol.1, page 165 As a result of her social stigma in high school, Theresa was left emotionally damaged and bearing a deep, unreasoning hatred for all blondes - including her later teammate Emp.Empowered Vol.1, pages 171&172 :Theresa performed a satanic ritual to call forth a demon to wreak vengeance against her tormentors. It turned out that this was the same demon that had been making pacts with the girls in her school and it tried to persuade her to make the deal herself. Despite appearing to resist she was later shown transformed, but due to an apparent clerical error on the part of the demon (later revealed to have been entirely deliberate as part of a scheme to free itself), Theresa had been granted far more supernatural power than she should have been.Empowered Vol.1, page 169 Through this, she was able to go on to become a superhero who is known for being sexually desirable as well as skilled in arcane magic. :Despite her deep-set hatred for blondes, Theresa had, before the events told in the series, entered in a relationship with the mute telepath Mindfuck, which she later broke off, blaming the failure on Mindfuck sharing hidden similarity to her psychopathic brother.Empowered Vol.4 However her later death in volume 5 left Theresa deeply traumatized, reduced in a barely functional mindset, capable of functioning normally only with external aid and assurance.Empowered vol. 6, p. 160 It has also been revealed she is partially responsible for Emp's poor luck, having deliberately cast a spell that subconsciously urges supervillains into holding her teammate in bondage in an attempt to humiliate her \\"rival\\" (an act she has come to be horrified by upon realizing how traumatic this is to Emp). :As a further aggravant to her unbalanced mental state, Theresa is currently haunted by an implanted telepathic echo of Mindfuck herself, and pursued by the demon who accidentally gave her mystical powers. The demon claims to have taken Mindfuck's soul to Hell, where he subjects her to unspeakable horrors, and will continue to do so until Theresa breaks off their contract, renouncing her beauty and powers. Theresa currently teeters between accepting this second bargain or keeping her might.Empowered Vol.6, p. 203 Super Dawg :Super Dawg is a male, costumed, posthuman hero, and a nominal member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Super dawg was shown ogling Empowered as she walked past.Empowered Vol.1, page 143 Super Dawg is shown to resemble an anthropomorphized British Bulldog in one instance, and a Pit Bull in another.Empowered Vol.1, page 140 Additionally, he features the forepaws of a dog instead of humanoid hands. :Super Dawg's pseudonym is an eye dialect of \\"Super dog\\". Syndablokk :Syndablokk is a posthuman male member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Syndablokk's pseudonym is as such due to his head and hands appearing to be cinderblocks.Empowered Vol.1, page 213 Despite this seeming physiological detriment, Syndablokk appears to be able to perform regular tasks that would normally require a certain degree of dexterousness of fingers, such as buckling his belt or putting on clothing. Additionally, like his colleague and fellow Superhomey, Protean, Syndablokk appears to have a full array of standard senses and is even able to communicate verbally, despite lacking all organs and structures that would normally facilitate this. This may be due in part to Syndablokk’s ability to communicate with concrete, masonry, and pavement in a manner similar to psychometry, as well as animate these materials in a manner similar to telekinesis.Empowered Vol.2, pages 28&29 Despite having such a powerful and unique ability, he is rarely seen to use it because the effect of his powers tends to linger for a time after he has finished using it, and his powers inherently cause a large amount of collateral damage. :Unlike most of his colleagues, Syndablokk is kind to Emp and seems to sympathize with her.Empowered Vol.2, pages 30&31 :Syndablokk is also commonly seen depicted in yaoi slash fan fiction manga with Major Havoc.Empowered Vol.1, pages 213-215 These stories are something of a guilty pleasure for Emp. :Syndablokk is an acquaintance of King Tyrant Lizard through their “Halycon days at the school”, which is implied to be a time before their transformations into their current posthuman biology.Empowered Vol.2, page 26 Turbobrain :Turbobrain is a male cybernetic human member of the Superhomeys superhero group. As indicated in his participation with the Superhomeys in attempting to ambush Willy Pete, Turbobrain is able to produce a telekinetic shield against fire.Empowered Viol.5, page 157 :Turbobrain is the \\"half\\" of the \\"One and a half\\" survivors of the ill-fated attempt to confront Willy Pete, the other revealed to be Major Havoc. During the Willy Pete assault, Turbobrain tried to shield both himself and Havoc from the fire, receiving horrific third degree burns on his whole body, but keeping Major Havoc relatively safe. Major Havoc later burns his arms by trying to drag away Turbobrain, and upon knowing of his full fate, keeps blaming Empowered for his current suffering Yummy Mummy :Yummy Mummy is a supposedly mummified female member if the Superhomeys superhero group. Yummy Mummy has not been shown in battle alongside the Superhomeys, nor has she had any meaningful part in any of the Empowered series, thus far. The extent of her participation has been as a background character amongst the core members of the Superhomeys,Empowered Vol.1, page 187 and some commentary in issue six disapproving of another member's tastes in entertainment.Empowered Vol. 6, page 68 Villains Anglerfish :Anglerfish is a posthuman supervillain whose head resembles the deep-ocean dwelling Anglerfish. Anglerfish’s gender is assumed to be male despite his mouth containing the fang-like teeth only found in female Black Seadevils; the species of which Anglerfish most closely resembles.Empowered Vol.5, page 100 :Anglerfish’s bioluminescent lure, which he calls his “lurelight”, induces powerful hallucinations in those that observe it. These hallucinations may or may not be constructs of Anglerfish himself as individuals in large groups will be tricked into seeing whatever may be the most alluring to them,Empowered Vol.5, pages 89-92 and he has also used his light in an attempt to placate Emp into not beating him up.Empowered Vol.5, page 101 :Anglerfish had a son known as Kid Anglerfish that was similar in appearance to Anglerfish; possessing a head that resembles an anglerfish and a lurelight that has hallucinogenic powers.Empowered Vol.4, page 73 Baby Bird :Baby bird a being that resembles a large embryonic chick, and is part of a trio with two other costumed villains.Empowered Vol.4, page 72 Its physical attributes regarding gender, race, and possible powers or abilities are not revealed, however, Baby Bird may possess human-like intelligence. Also, as shown in an encounter with Willy Pete, Baby Bird’s flesh is resilient enough to withstand prolonged exposure to intense heat and fire.Empowered Vol.4, page 77 :Baby bird was sodomized to death and eaten by Willy Pete when the trio attempted to recruit Willy Pete into joining their villainous group on their way to assist the Felonifive on a planned assault of the pharmacy for the Purple Paladin Memorial Hospital.Empowered Vol.4, pages 63&73-80 Baron Womb :Baron Womb is a possible villain that was mentioned by Major Havoc as having extreme psychosis or an alternate personality that was able to confuse Mindfuck’s telepathic abilities. Big Iron :Big Iron is a mechanical humanoid supervillain that threatened the city that is defended by the Superhomeys. In his only appearance in the series, he became greatly offended when Emp was dispatched by the Superhomeys to deal with his attempt at ransoming the city with a large bomb. Big Iron’s indignation at the appearance of Emp, implication that he was not a “Heavy Hitter”, was so great that he almost immediately abandoned his plot (and bomb).Empowered Vol.1, pages 32-35 :Big Iron may take his name from the slang term for Cray supercomputers or high-gauge handguns. Blunt Trauma :Blunt Trauma is a member of the “Apocalypse Clique” supervillain group. Not much is known of Blunt Trauma other than, within the Empowered universe, his image is licensed for an action figure and that he is probably a supporter of the legalization of marijuana.Empowered Vol1, pages 114&115 :Blunt Trauma’s action figure depicts him as having a bare-skull head with oversized incisors on his lower jaw and a large marijuana cigar protruding from his mouth, and a ball mace in place of his right hand.Empowered Vol.1, page 114 :Blunt Trauma's pseudonym is a double entendre signified by his apparent use of marijuana and the medical term Blunt trauma, which refers to a type of physical trauma caused to a body part, either by impact, injury or physical attack. Chloroformaster :Chloroformaster is a male costumed villain. Since Chloroformaster, or “The Notorious CFM”, never actually causes bodily harm to those that he targets, he is considered amongst the superhero community to be more of a nuisance than an actual threat. However, there is some contention between the female and male heroes over whether or not this is a fair designation; Sistah Spooky was very vocal over her assessments of CFM because she had been one of the many heroines that had been targeted.Empowered Vol.3, pages 63&64 :Chloroformaster is essentially nothing more than a fetishist that prefers to target unsuspecting heroines, upon which he uses chloroform to render unconscious. He then usually pleasures himself to the sight of their unconscious forms and later posts photos of them on his Internet blog.Empowered Vol.3, pages 63&68-70 Chloroformaster once rendered Major Havoc unconscious, but released him with a note asking him not to tell anybody that he had been captured as \\"...it just felt really gay.\\"Empowered Vol.3, page 65 :Chloroformaster was defeated and captured by Emp when he accidentally fell asleep after pleasuring himself to her.Empowered Vol.3, pages 70&71 :Chloroformaster's pseudonym is a noun-noun compound word composed of the words \\"Chloroform\\" and Master\\". Crimera :Crimera is a supervillain that was shown in a short full-color chapter in the beginning of Volume 4 of the Empowered graphic novel series. Crimera appears to be an armored, anthropomorphic lion that stands on its hind legs, with a goat head on the end of his right arm, and a fire-breathing dragon head on the end of his left. Crimera is possibly one of the more powerful villains faced by the Superhomeys, as dWARf!, Captain Rivet, and Major Havoc were shown to be defeated and left unconscious by Crimera. :Whatever Crimera’s power may be, he was quickly dealt with by Emp when she ran over him with an H3 Hummer.Empowered Vol.4, page 15 :Crimera’s name is a portmanteau of the words Crime and Chimera. Crimson Camel :Crimson Camel is a villain that was mentioned briefly by Major Havoc along with Glue Gun Gil. The Crimson Camel was mentioned as an example of a “scrub” villain who would be susceptible to the tactics recommended by Capitan Rivet.Empowered Vol.1, page 6 Deathmonger :Deathmonger is a female supervillain who was not shown until Volume 6, despite being the center of a major conflict in Volume 1. In this, Deathmonger mounted a major attack on City Hall with the assistance of her \\"Scythebots\\". This plot was eventually foiled, but not without several civilian injuries and fatalities.Empowered Vol.1, pages 126-131 However, her main superpower involves absolute control over the bargainers, dead superheroes who -- having received their powers from supernatural beings and goddesses -- are unable to truly die, but keep inhabiting their corpses, kept functional by their own powers. As such, before the main series event, she has amassed a huge army of bargainers, and upon fitting them with control devices (and harvesting their superpowered body parts when failing), planned to conquer the world. In her previous appearance, the SuperHomeys and Thugboy were enough only to halt her efforts; in her second-last appearance, with her undead army, her defeat requires Ninjette, Maid Man, Sistah Spooky and a contingent of free superdead, under the leadership of Empowered, who wielded Phallik's phallospear against the villain. She returned in volume 9, where she revealed her true gender (commenting that \\"everyone just assumed I was male\\"). Doomsloth :Doomsloth is a costumed male supervillain with a large retinue of uniformed henchpersons. Doomsloth’s powers, if any, may have been afforded by the large helmet and three-clawed gauntlets that appear to be a part of his costume. :Doomsloth was never shown in action; only being captured by Protean and his henchmen forced into knocking themselves unconscious by Sistah Spooky.Empowered Vol.1, pages 51-54 Doomsloth’s motives for being a villain may be questionable, as he appeared to be more concerned over his reputation with other villains than having his plot foiled.Empowered Vol.1, pages 55&56 Glue Gun Gil :Glue Gun Gil is not actually seen in any conflict, but Empowered is seen bound and gagged in hardened thermoplastic adhesive, indicating that he had defeated her. In assisting Emp in extricating herself from the adhesive, Sistah Spooky mentioned that Glue Gun Gil is one of the “lamest ‘villains’ to ‘terrorize’ the city”. However, Glue Gun Gil may slightly outclass a pair of villains known as Ladder Master and The Pink Elephant.Empowered Vol.1, page 163 Glue Gun Gil is most likely a homage to the Marvel Comics supervillain Paste Pot Pete. Hand Cholo :Hand Cholo is a posthuman/mutant member of the Felonifive supervillain group. Hand Cholo derives his name from the fact that his hands are slightly larger than they should be, and his head is an oversized right hand. Rather than just being cosmetic, Hand Cholo’s hand/head is fully capable of articulated movement. And, while the hand/head lacks the necessary organs to do so, Hand Cholo is able to speak and hear others; vision is not demonstrably shown.Empowered Vol.4, pages 56&61 :Hand Cholo’s name may be an indication of him having a mixed heritage of Hispanic origin. His name may also be word play of the name of the fictional Star Wars character “Han Solo”. Icy Mike :Icy Mike is a male costumed supervillain that was briefly shown as one of the many villains that Thugboy had served as a henchperson for. Icy Mike’s exploits seem to involve cryogenics and refrigeration technology. He has also mentioned that he makes frequent use of his “cryogun“.Empowered Vol.3, page 123 :Like most of the supervillains that Thugboy has been a lackey for, Icy Mike was eventually subdued and had most of his technology stolen by Thugboy and the “Witless Minions”. Thugboy’s given reason for eventually turning on Icy Mike was that he didn’t mind supporting villains that used the threat of mass-murder for monetary gain, but he would not allow Icy Mike to continue when he managed to produce a working “cryobomb” that could purportedly kill up to 50,000 civilians.Empowered Vol.3, pages 123&124 Idea Man :Idea Man is a male supervillain whose costume theme aimed to accentuate his ability to generate ideas for criminal plots.Empowered Vol.2, page 87 One of these plot was to use the disembodied brain of a former telepathic villain named Psychoblast to “unleash an apocalypse”.Empowered Vol.2, page 91 To this end, Idea Man, who knew of Psychoblast’s fetishes, had his henchpersons seek out a person who suitably met the criteria of a “sexy librarian”. In order to track down and capture Idea Man, the Superhomeys set a trap in having Emp dress in an appropriate manner to lure Idea Man’s henchpersons into capturing her.Empowered Vol.2, pages 84-86 Judas Moose :Judas Moose is a possible supervillain. Major Havoc mentioned Judas Moose as an example of an unusual or exotic mind that would fool Mindfuck’s perceptions. Judas Moose may also have a “Kludge Mind”, similar to what Mindfuck thought that Willy Pete had.Empowered Vol.5, page 160 Katastrophe :Katastrophe (German for \\"catastrophe\\" or \\"disaster\\") is a male costumed villain who was once a part of a trio with Kid Anglerfish and Baby Bird.Empowered Vol.4, pages 72-74 Katastrophe wore a costume that appeared to include the skull of a Sabertoothed Tiger, worn as a helmet, as well as small replicas worn on the backs of his hands.Empowered Vol.4, page 74 :Similar to his former colleague, Baby Bird, Katastrophe’s only demonstrated superhuman ability is resilience against the intense heat generated by Willy Pete. Also like Baby Bird, Katastrophe was cannibalized and sodomized by Willy Pete.Empowered Vol.4, pages 76-80 Kid Anglerfish :Kid Anglerfish is a male posthuman villain and member of a villainous trio with Baby Bird and Katastrophe. Like his father, Anglerfish, Kid Anglerfish’s head takes the appearance of a deep-ocean dwelling Anglerfish with teeth normally found in female Black Seadevils. Also like his father, Kid Anglerfish has a hallucination inducing “lurelight”, something that his father has stated that he has only ever used to get sex.Empowered Vol.5, page 105 :Kid Anglerfish’s appearance is most likely genetic, because of his resemblance to his father. :Willy Pete implied that he caused Kid Anglerfish’s brain to explode due to a sudden, massive increase in temperature while he sodomized his eye sockets.Empowered Vol.4, page 76 Killing Time :Killing Time, formerly known as Time2, is a male costumed villain that speaks in time-related puns and uses weaponry based on timepieces. Killing Time does not have any actual powers and is shown to only be a threat if he manages to use one of his many hand-weapons, such as his \\"Chronoshillelagh\\" and “Chronobolo”.Empowered Vol.2, pages 159-161 :Emp quickly defeated Killing Time when she “channeled” the elemental power of earth by smashing his head with a large rock. King Tyrant Lizard :King Tyrant Lizard, or “KTL”,Empowered Vol.2, page 19 is a male posthuman supervillain and member of The Apocalypse Clique,Empowered Vol.1, page 115 who resembles a bipedal saurian. King Tyrant Lizard derives his name for the English translation of the saurian species name Tyrannosaurus rex. King Tyrant lizard possesses superhuman strength and is shown to have great resilience against blunt impacts as well as energy blasts.Empowered Vol.2, pages 21&22Empowered Vol.2, pages 27-31 As described by Syndablokk, before his transformation, King Tyrant Lizard was an angst-filled teenager named Jerome. And even in his posthuman form, he is shown to have tantrums whenever people mock his sibilant lisp or damage the small crown he has chained to his head. Ladder Master :Ladder Master is a villain mentioned by Sistah Spooky as possibly being even more lame, within the villainous milieu that terrorize the city, than Glue Gun Gil. Laser Brain :Laser Brain is a male costumed villain and member of the Felonifive supervillain group. Laser Brain’s powers, if any, are not shown or mentioned, but he is depicted as having a large, exposed brain that engulfs the top of his head, from the nose up.Empowered Vol.4, page 56 However, it is also possible that it is actually a stylized helmet, as it was shown being directly struck by Maid Man.Empowered Vol.4, page 66 Lone Gunman :Lone Gunman is a male costumed villain that loosely themes himself as an outlaw of the American Old West. He is most likely a low- priority villain amongst heroes, as he has a very laid-back attitude and cocksure manner, even while committing robberies.Empowered Vol.2, page 77&78 Lone Gunman was not demonstrated to have any special abilities or attributes, but he does use a large caliber handgun in confrontations with assailing heroes.Empowered Vol.2, page 77 :Ultimately, his disdain for the law and utter disrespect for Emp’s abilities as a hero were his downfall.Empwered Vol.2, page 78-81 Manny :Manny was a male 11-year-old cancer patient at the Purple Paladin Memorial hospital. Manny had been diagnosed with a terminal case of leukemia, which would deny him his dream of growing up to become a supervillain. So, through the assistance of the Grant-A-Wish program, and some coercion from Sistah Spooky, Emp was convinced to meet Manny and assist in granting his wish to experience the capture of a superhero.Empowered Vol.4, pages 109-116 :Soon after his experience in “capturing” Emp, Manny worked up the courage to somehow bypass the security of the pharmacy for the Purple Paladin Memorial hospital and steal a dose of an extraterrestrial carcinogen known as “Mayfly”. After ingesting the Mayfly, and receiving the subsequent cerebral growth caused by a multitude of carcinogenic brain tumors that the drug causes, Manny built a Powered exoskeleton out of purloined hospital equipment and went missing.Empowered Vol.4, pages 118-123 :Later, in the aftermath of the sabotaged Caped Justice awards, Manny sent an army of robots that he had constructed, and abducted dWARf! so that he might devise a treatment for his terminal condition.Empowered Vol.4, pages 189-192 The Pink Elephant :The Pink Elephant is a villain that was mentioned, along with Ladder Master, as being even more pathetic than Glue Gun Gil. Quasarmodo :Quasarmodo is a minor male supervillain who was briefly shown participating in an instructional video alongside Ocelotina. Through his participation in said video, and his status as an actual, if inept, villain, Ocelotina’s validity as a “wannabe“ costumed hero is brought into question.Empowered Vol.3, page 142 :Quasarmodo’s name is a portmanteau of “Quasar” and “Quasimodo”. Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash :Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash, was originally a trio of villains that had themed themselves in dress and affectation of speech after British naval culture. After the man calling himself Rum was sent to court-ordered AA meetings for his many DUIs and the man calling himself Sodomy became fed up with constantly trying to explain that he strictly represented heterosexual sodomy gave up and left the group, The Lash took on their names and tried to continue in the same vein of context.Empowered Vol.1, pages 136&137 :In time spent in this villainous persona, Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash affects a comically heavy British accent, is seen drinking rum from a bottle, and battles with a bullwhip. :In an encounter with Emp, Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash was proficient enough with the bullwhip to capture and throw Emp through the plate glass window of a fabric store.Empowered Vol.1, page 135 However, due to his phobia or hatred of fabric stores, an issue that was developed in his childhood when his mother would take him to shop at fabric stores for hours on end, RSL gave up the chase and conceded a shallow victory to Emp.Empowered Vol.1, page 137&138 :Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash takes his name from a quote concerning naval tradition, made by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Spartan 3000 :Spartan 3000 is one of the many costumed villains that Thugboy has served under as a henchman. Spartan 3000 has never been shown, but is notable within the milieu of villains for the level of detail in his Spartan warrior-themed henchmen’s costume uniforms.Empowered Vol.1, page 153 For Emp, Thugboy’s Spartan 3000 costume is very arousing and something of a fetish; much like how Emp's Sexy Librarian costume is for Thugboy.Empowered Vol.1, page 153;Empowered Vol.5, pages 59-68 :Like most villains that Thugboy had worked under, Spartan 3000 was eventually driven into bankruptcy by the underhanded dealing of the Witless Minions.Empowered Vol.1, page 152 Super Caucasian :Super Caucasian is a supervillain briefly mentioned in Volume 1. Super Caucasian is supposedly a white supremacist that will only hire henchpersons if they are sufficiently Caucasoid. Thugboy briefly worked for Super Caucasian but was fired when his sunglasses were knocked off and revealed his eyes to be epicanthic in appearance;Empowered Vol.1, page 188 a common trait in people from East Asian countries. Weird Beard :Weird Beard is a male costumed supervillain and member of the Felonifive supervillain group. Weird Beard calls himself as such because of his long, flowing beard that is able to move and interact with objects like an extra appendage.Empowered Vol.5, page 56 The nature of his beard’s movement is not known, but the power-nullifying field of Wet Blanket equally affects it. :Maid Man captured Weird Beard, along with the rest of the Felonifive, by infiltrating the group as the villainous doppelganger \\"Crowquet\\".Empowered Vol.4, pages 57-60&62-69 Wet Blanket :Wet Blanket is a male costumed villain and member of the Felonifive supervillain group. Wet Blanket is unusual in the world of superhumans in that he passively exudes an aura that nullifies all forms and types of superhuman abilities in those around him.Empowered Vol.4, page 62 This field effect has an effective radius of approximately 25 feet.Empowered Vol.4, page 59 Additionally, the field is generated by every cell in his body, and appears to not be affected by cellular metabolism. This was demonstrated when Wet Blanket’s flesh was used to taint the catered food served at the Caped Justice Awards ceremony, thus de-powering the majority of the heroes in attendance.Empowered Vol.4, pages 160-161 The only heroes to have retained their effectiveness despite having eaten the power-nullifying flesh of Wet Blanket were those that did not have powers to begin with and those whose abilities stemmed from technology. :In addition to his power nullifying abilities Wet Blanket is generally an annoying person (and hence a \\"wet blanket\\" at any gathering) because he tries to impress his politically correct viewpoints on others. In this, he is shown commenting on the lack of diversity in the henchmen that are hired by the Felonifive, trying to convince the other villains of the group to switch to energy saving Incandescent lightbulbs, and renting An Inconvenient Truth instead of the horror movies that his colleagues had wanted to see.Empowered Vol.4, page 61 :The fate of Wet Blanket is unknown. In volume 4, it is shown that dWARf! had abducted Wet Blanket and removed at least 12 lbs. of flesh from him in order to sabotage the upcoming Caped Justice awards. However, Wet Blanket is not indicated to have survived or perished as a result. :Wet Blanket's powers are very similar to those of Leech in the Marvel Universe. Willy Pete :Willy Pete takes his name from the military jargon term for white phosphorus. It is presumed that he does so because he is -- as he has termed himself -- a “Fire Elemental”. Whatever his origin, he appears to be a mass of self-sustaining plasma that takes the form of a bearded nude man.Empowered Vol.1, pages 155-160; Vol.2, page 170-171; Vol.3, pages 128-132; Vol.4, pages 75-80; Vol.5, pages 157-165 Thus far, Willy Pete’s true nature is not clearly revealed beyond assumptions about himself. :Willy Pete is a horrendously degenerate being whose primary focus in existence has been to find beings, of any gender, with enough resilience to withstand his intense heat so that he may have forced intercourse or sodomize them in their various orifices. :While under normal conditions, Willy Pete only produces temperatures in the hundreds to thousands of degrees; it was shown that he is capable of outputting fusion-level temperatures in the 6-digit range. Something that he did, which subsequently caused the Joint Superhero Space Station 3, colloquially known as the “D10”, to lose its orbit of Earth and disintegrate in the atmosphere.Empowered Vol5. pages 160-193 Other characters The Caged Demonwolf :\\"The Caged Demonwolf\\" is a multidimensional being of pure energy that resides atop Emp's coffee table within the power-draining bondage gear the Imperial Pimpotron had used to capture her. The origin and attributes of The Caged Demonwolf are something of a mystery in that he appears to be a being of pure energy, who requires a physical host in order to inhabit the three-dimensional material plane. The Caged Demonwolf often predicts events before they occur and speaks of things he was not around to experience, however, he has been shown to give illuminations of what he believes Emp and Thugboy's sexual escapades to be like, and this may indicate that he simply likes to use his imagination. :Although he is most commonly known as \\"The Caged Demonwolf\\", he has been known to refer to himself in other ways. And, because of his alliterative wordiness and tendencies to speak in the third person (even if he can speak in a normal fashion when he chooses to do so), it is somewhat difficult to know if he has one specific name, or possibly none at all.

As the series has progressed, The Caged Demonwolf becomes more accepting of his situation and more amicable to Emp, Thugboy, and Ninjette, even confessing to a drunk Ninjette that due to his immortality he will regret surviving his new friends. The Caged Demonwolf is also shown to be on good speaking terms with Emp's mother, who (as the conversations are over the telephone in Emp's suit) is presumably unaware of his origins. Ayakami-Clan ninja :The Ayakami Clan ninja are a group that have been contracted by the Kaburagi clan to capture and return the ninja-princess, Ninjette (also known as Kozue Kaburagi), to her clan. The Ayakami clan is apparently well studied in a form of ninjutsu that allows them to suppress extreme pain. This skill was greatly demonstrated during their attempt to capture Ninjette in a park. :Unlike other ninjas thus far shown within the Empowered series, those of the Ayakami clan almost constantly conceal their faces behind Noh masks. This is something that they have been shown to do even without the presence of others, although, they were shown without the masks for a brief period before attempting to trap Ninjette. :By the end of volume 3 of the Empowered series, numerous Ayakami clan ninja were all killed in their attempt to capture Ninjete, mainly because of timely assistance from Emp and Thugboy. Thugboy himself was seen shooting their bodies to finish them off. Volume 7 focuses on the remainder of their forces attempting to capture Ninjette, only to be defeated by the combined force of the ninja princess and Oyuki. Oyuki noted to herself that Ninjette's victory over the Ayakami would only reinforce her own clan's efforts to capture her. Nurse Foxtrot & Nurse Whiskey :Nurses Foxtrot and Whiskey are two medical assistants seen alongside Dr. Big McLarge Huge. Foxtrot and Whiskey are very similar in appearance as well as appear to be examples of perfect or idealized human physiology. Their physical condition is indicated to not be coincidental. Something which is further exemplified by the appearances of the other female and male nurses of the Suprahuman wing of the Purple Paladin Memorial Hospital. Additionally, the nurse uniforms of the Suprahuman treatment wing appear to be designed to draw attention to the physical perfection of the nurses. :Whatever may be the impetus behind the nurses' appearances, it is most likely artificially induced, as some of the nurses in attendance of the Caped Justice Awards were shown to revert to a less-than-ideal physiology when they became affected by the tainted catered food. :Nurse Whiskey and Nurse Foxtrot are named for the letters W and F in the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, respectively. Oyuki-chan :Oyuki-chan is a female ninja of the New Jersey-based Kaburagi ninja clan. Oyuki-chan expresses open contempt towards Ninjette because of her abandonment of the clan, but is somehow indebted to her; her animosity (and simultaneous indebtedness) seems mostly due to Ninjette using a permanent anti-pregnancy jutsu on her when they were younger, at Oyuki's request, which she may now as an adult severely regret.Empowered Vol7. pages 206-210 :Like Ninjette, Oyuki-chan is a practitioner of ninjutsu. Particularly, a disguise ability that allowed her to perfectly mimic Thugboy in appearance. However, this illusion was imperfect, as Ninjette was able to detect the deception because Oyuki did not smell like Thugboy. Oyuki-chan refers to herself only in the third person, and her speech is both extremely formal and extremely profane. Imperial Pimpotron Alpha :Imperial Pimpotron Alpha is an extraterrestrial autonomous robot that abducts female alien specimens to serve in an intergalactic harem for an unnamed \\"Cosmic Emperor\\". In Imperial Pimpotron Alpha's only appearance in the series, it captured Emp with power-draining mechanical bondage gear as a preamble to \\"testing\\" Emp's body to see if she fit within specifications for harem duty. :Fortunately for Emp, Imperial Pimpotron Alpha determined that her buttocks were too ample and that meant she was not fit for abduction into the intergalactic harem. However, as fortunate as she may have been in not being taken, Imperial Pimpotron Alpha's implication that her buttocks were too large still saddened Emp. :Imperial Pimpotron Alpha was extremely wordy and spoke in a comical manner, using inappropriate compound words that have relatively obvious implied meaning: ::\\"Tremblejiggle as the legendary Imperial Cosmichains drain away all your super-powertude, nubile femmeling! But, you should tremblejiggle with pride, young mammalette... For you are being deeply honorified! For I, Imperial Pimpotron Alpha, am Scouticruiting you for priviligious erotiservitude to the Cosmolactic Emperor's harem!\\" :It may be possible that Imperial Pimpotron Alpha's speech patterns are normal for the society that created him, as even the instrument he used to gauge Emp spoke with the same affectations: ::\\"Analysizing Complete! Subject's Oralitudity is confirmated as suffiquately succuluscious for harem duty.\\" :Despite Imperial Pimpotron Alpha's initial certainty that Emp would be acceptable for harem duties, she was summarily rejected when she was found to be too steatopygious for the Emperor's tastes.

Algiers had been nominally part of the Ottoman Empire since the Capture of Algiers in 1529 by Hayreddin Barbarossa. A diplomatic incident in 1827, the so-called Fan Affair (Fly Whisk Incident), served as a pretext to initiate a blockade against the port of Algiers. After three years of standstill and a more severe incident in which a French ship carrying an ambassador to the dey with a proposal for negotiations was bombarded, the French determined that more forceful action was required. Charles X was also in need of diverting attention from turbulent French domestic affairs that culminated with his deposition during the later stages of the invasion in the July Revolution. The invasion of Algiers began on 5 July 1830 with a naval bombardment by a fleet under Admiral Duperré and a landing by troops under Louis Auguste Victor de Ghaisne, comte de Bourmont. The French quickly defeated the troops of Hussein Dey, the Ottoman ruler, but native resistance was widespread. This resulted in a protracted military campaign, lasting more than 45 years, to root out popular opposition to the colonisation. The so- called \\"pacification\\" was marked by resistance of figures such as Ahmed Bey, Abd El-Kader and Lalla Fatma N'Soumer. The invasion marked the end of several centuries of Ottoman rule in Algeria and the beginning of French Algeria. In 1848, the territories conquered around Algiers were organised into three départements, defining the territories of modern Algeria.  Background  During the Napoleonic Wars, the Regency of Algiers had greatly benefited from trade in the Mediterranean, and of the massive imports of food by France, largely bought on credit. The Dey of Algiers attempted to remedy his steadily decreasing revenues by increasing taxes, which was resisted by the local peasantry, increasing instability in the country and leading to increased piracy against merchant shipping from Europe and the young United States of America. This, in turn, led to the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War, which culminated in August 1816 when Edward Pellew executed a naval bombardment of Algiers in response to Algerian massacres of recently freed European slaves. The widespread unpopularity of the Bourbon Restoration among the French populace at large also made France unstable. In an attempt to distract his people from domestic affairs, King Charles X decided to engage in a colonial expedition. The \\"Fan Affair\\" which was the pretext for the invasion. In 1827, Hussein Dey, Algeria's Ottoman ruler, demanded that the French pay a 28-year-old debt contracted in 1799 by purchasing supplies to feed the soldiers of the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt. The French consul Pierre Deval refused to give answers satisfactory to the dey, and in an outburst of anger, Hussein Dey touched the consul with his fly-whisk. Charles X used this as an excuse to initiate a blockade against the port of Algiers. The blockade lasted for three years, and was primarily to the detriment of French merchants who were unable to do business with Algiers, while Barbary pirates were still able to evade the blockade. When France in 1829 sent an ambassador to the dey with a proposal for negotiations, he responded with cannon fire directed toward one of the blockading ships. The French then determined that more forceful action was required. King Charles X decided to organise a punitive expedition on the coasts of Algiers to punish the \\"impudence\\" of the dey, as well as to root out Barbary corsairs who used Algiers as a safe haven. The naval part of the operation was given to Admiral Duperré, who advised against it, finding it too dangerous. He was nevertheless given command of the fleet. The land part was under the orders of Louis Auguste Victor de Ghaisne, comte de Bourmont. On 16 May, a fleet comprising 103 warships and 464 transports departed Toulon, carrying a 37,612-man strong army. The ground was well-known, thanks to observations made during the First Empire, and the Presque-isle of Sidi Ferruch was chosen as a landing spot, west of Algiers. The vanguard of the fleet arrived off Algiers on 31 May, but it took until 14 June for the entire fleet to arrive.

Within a few days, however, troops of Algerian caids started to rise against the invaders. On 18 June, Hussein Dey assembled a 10,000-man army, comprising 1,000 Janissaries, 5,000 Moors and 3,000 Arabs and Berbers from Oran, Titteri and Medea. Bourmont merely kept the counter- attacks at bay until 28 June, when siege weapons were landed, making it possible to attack Algiers itself. Fighting at the gates of Algiers.

Sultan-Khalessi, the main fort defending the city, was attacked on 29 June and fell on 4 July. The Bey then started negotiations, leading to his capitulation the next day. At the same time, in France, the July Revolution led to the deposition of Charles X. French troops entered the city on 5 July, and evacuated the Casbah on 7 July. The French had 415 killed. The Dey was exiled to Naples, and some of the Janissaries to the Ottoman Empire. Bourmont immediately instituted a municipal council and a governmental commission to administer the city. Before the new status of Algiers could be settled, Bourmont struck at Blida and occupied Bône and Oran in early August. On 11 August, news of the July Revolution reached Algiers, and Bourmont was required to pledge allegiance to Charles' successor Louis-Philippe, which he refused to do. He was relieved of command and replaced by general Bertrand Clauzel on 2 September. Negotiations were started with the beys of Titteri, Oran and Constantine to impose a French protectorate, spreading French influence over the entire former Regency.  Effects  With the French invasion of Algiers, a number of Algerians migrated west to Tetuan. They introduced baklava, coffee, and the warqa pastry now used in pastilla.

When used in the normal orientation, the prism inverts the image (that is, rotates it 180 degrees); rotating the orientation results in image rotation to other arbitrary angles. The base surface must be fabricated with a mirror coating to make it reflective. The other two surfaces are not coated, since they are internally reflective from the ray angles and high-index glass. The simple form of the prism also results in image mirroring along one meridian but not the other, a consequence of the odd parity of three reflections involved. If the base surface is roofed, the number of reflections increases to an even four. The roofed prism thus acts as an image erector, rotating the image without the mirroring effect of the unroofed form.

It incorporated the previous Center on Religion and Society, and took over publication of both The Religion and Society Report and The Family In America. It created and coordinates the World Congress of Families, a group known for its involvement with the 2013 Russian LGBT propaganda law and opposing LGBT rights internationally. The current chairman of the board is Bill Andrews of Chicago, with a total of fifteen board members including Dallin H. Oaks who is an honorary board member. As of 2018, the president was Brian S. Brown. The Howard Center for Family, Religion and Society and the International Organization for the Family, whose directors include an ultra-conservative Spanish activist linked to the leader of the far-right Vox party, both support the World Congress of Families (WCF) network.

Founded in 2004, Ze-gen was a venture-backed company based in Boston, Massachusetts. The company aimed to develop innovative technological solutions to reduce landfills and find beneficial use for waste material by converting waste to energy and nutrients, using advanced gasification. Today Ze-gen appears to be defunct, and the company website was taken down in 2014.Closed Ze-gen company website on Wayback Machine Technology The liquid metal gasification process begins with feed material entering the gasifier through a gas-tight airlock into a refractory-lined vessel containing liquid copper, which is held at about 2200 °F. Material entering into the liquid metal gasifier undergoes a series of thermo-chemical reactions, which are auto-thermal under stable operating conditions. Initially, pyrolysis occurs and volatiles are driven into the headspace of the gasifier. In the subsequent gasification reaction, hydrogen () and carbon monoxide (CO) are favored as final products, along with carbon dioxide () and a small amount of methane (). This product gas is called synthesis gas, also known as syngas. The inorganic constituents, which are generally lighter than liquid metal, form a slag layer on top of the liquid metal bath and are removed as a vitrified non-leachable slag byproduct. The slag is either recycled or disposed of as an industrial by-product. While some metals and oxides present in the feedstock accumulate in the liquid metal bath, others will exit as vapor and are captured in the gas cleanup process. The syngas produced can be used for several different end-use applications including: steam generation, electricity production, making industrial hydrogen gas, as chemical building blocks for synthetic diesel or ethanol, synthetic natural gas, methanol, or as a chemical feedstock into a variety of industrial processes. Pilot Facility Ze-gen's demonstration facility is colocated with a processing facility owned by New Bedford Waste Services, LLC in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The facility was built to test the key parameters of the gasification process in order to more fully understand the chemistry of the system and the operating parameters. The plant became operational in November 2007, and Ze-gen achieved target synthesis gas quality in June 2008. The data and analysis collected during the Phase I testing helped to inform modifications and upgrades in the facility. Phase II testing began in September 2009. As of June 2011, the demonstration facility has logged over 4200 hours of operation, including 30 days of consecutive runtime. Commercial Facility Ze-gen plans to develop its first commercial facility in Attleboro, Massachusetts. The proposed facility is to be located within the Attleboro Corporate Campus, a former Texas Instruments manufacturing facility and now the home to a number of businesses. Through the conversion of 44,000 tons of specific waste streams annually, the syngas produced at the facility will be used to generate approximately 7MW of alternative energy. The thermal and electrical power will be sold to tenants within the corporate campus, allowing the campus to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. In April 2011, Ze- gen announced its decision to suspend its project in Attleboro in order to focus on developing its commercial facility project at a site with stronger energy markets and one that's more receptive to alternative energy development. Funding As of 2009, Ze-gen has received $30 million in funding from sources including: Omar Zawawi Establishment, Flagship Ventures, VantagePoint Venture Partners, and Massachusetts Technology Development Corporation.http://www.newenergyworldnetwork.com/renewable-energy- news/by_technology/energy_efficiency/ze-gen-raises-20m-in-series-b- financing.html See also *Gasification *Fischer-Tropsch *Syngas *Landfills References External links * “Ze-gen Energized By Middle East Conglomerate” * “A Special Report on Waste: The Appliance of Science” * “Betting on a Hot Market For Syngas” * “Energy Firm May Buzz into Attleboro” * \\"Howard Named CEO at Ze-gen\\" Category:Energy companies of the United States ","title":"Ze-gen"},{"id":"24045552","text":"\\"I Love How You Love Me\\" is a song written by Barry Mann and Larry Kolber. It was a 1961 Top Five hit for the pop girl group The Paris Sisters, which inaugurated a string of elaborately produced classic hits by Phil Spector. Bobby Vinton had a Top Ten hit in 1968 with a cover version. The song has been recorded by many other artists over the years. The Paris Sisters version Background The Paris Sisters recorded \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" at Gold Star Studios in the autumn of 1961 with Phil Spector as their producer. The group vocalized repeatedly to a piano accompaniment until Spector was satisfied with the balance between the voices, after which a string arrangement which Spector worked on over several days with Hank Levine was added. The song featured a spoken recitation by lead singer Priscilla Paris, speaking the first half of the repeated first verse in an unsung manner over the instrumental break. According to Lester Sill, with whom Spector was then staying, Spector would bring the tapes for \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" from Gold Star Studios every evening to review in his room: \\"he would wake me up at three or four in the morning, listening to [the song] over and over again at a very low level.\\" Sill says Spector \\"must have remixed the strings on that song thirty times; then listened to it for another four or five days before he was sure it was right. Then finally when the record was pressed he listened to the pressing for another two or three days before he gave it an approval.\\" Spector's interest in the song was occasioned by its structural similarity to \\"To Know Him Is to Love Him\\", the No. 1 hit that Spector's group, the Teddy Bears, had scored in 1958. Annette Kleinbard who had been the Teddy Bears' vocalist, would weep upon hearing The Paris Sisters' \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" on her car radio: \\"Before [Priscilla Paris] sung five words I knew it was Phil's record...it was just the most beautiful record, but I loved it and I hated it at the same time; it felt like Phil had taken my voice and passed it on to someone else\\". However Priscilla Paris would opine: \\"My sound was not like Annette's - she had a very thin type of little girl voice. I have a heavy roque - that's a French word meaning very heavy, husky - voice. I think Phil fell into something he wanted to do, added extra ingredients, and ended up with something different.\\" \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" was originally intended for Tony Orlando, to be arranged in the same upbeat style as Orlando's precedent hits \\"Bless You\\" and \\"Halfway to Paradise\\".1 The song was written by Barry Mann and Larry Kolber (aka Kolberg) who were staff writers at Don Kirshner's Aldon Music near the Brill Building. Kolber had written the lyrics on a restaurant napkin within five minutes. When Phil Spector discovered the song on a visit to Kirshner's Aldon offices he persuaded Kirshner that the song would have more potential if rendered by a female act. Spector then recorded \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" with The Paris Sisters. Entering the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1961, \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" reached No. 5 that November. Billboard named the song #100 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. The song was used in episode 5 of the 2017 Twin Peaks continuation. Bobby Vinton version Background Bobby Vinton made a comeback in the late 1960s when producer Billy Sherrill had him remake songs which had been hits a few years previous. Vinton took his cover of \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" to No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 2 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart. The hit re-vitalized Vinton's recording career and was certified Gold by the RIAA. Due to the success of the single, Epic Records released the album I Love How You Love Me that was also a best seller into 1969. Vinton followed up with a version of \\"To Know Him Is to Love Him\\" with a track entitled, \\"To Know You Is to Love You\\" (coincidentally Vinton's precedent single to \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" had been a remake of \\"Halfway to Paradise\\" the Tony Orlando hit to which \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" had been written as the intended followup). Marika Gombitová version Background \\"Luk a šíp\\" () is a cover version of the Paris Sisters song, recorded by Slovak female singer Marika Gombitová. Her version, featuring alternate lyrics, was released on Diskotéka OPUSu 1 compilation by OPUS in 1978.For Marika Gombitová's discography, see .

However the original version was included on the single release of \\"Anyone\\" on which it was subtitled \\"Tits & Ass Demo 1998\\". *\\"I Love How You Love Me\\" has also been recorded by Eddy Arnold, Chet Atkins, the Babys, The Broken Family Band, Dana (No. 27 in the Netherlands in 1977), Camera Obscura, Kria Brekkan, Billy Fury, the Lettermen, Lorrie Morgan, Mud, Neutral Milk Hotel, Beth Orton, Sandy Posey, Topi Sorsakoski (Finnish \\"Vain yksin me kakis\\"), Jerry Vale, Jeff Mangum, Wizex (as \\"En vän för alltid\\"), Maureen Evans, Rachel York, and Saito Yuki. *The 2000-01 European hit \\"Love How You Love Me\\" by Melanie Thornton (Austria No. 48/ Germany No. 15/ Switzerland No. 29) is not related to \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" rather being an original composition by Thornton co-written with Mitchell Lennox and Julien Nairolf. *Kramer produced and sang his version of this song for his Tzadik Records album The Brill Building (2012). *In the Sonny and Cher biopic And the Beat Goes On, televised in 1999, Cher - who was visiting Sonny Bono in the studio where the track for \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" is being recorded - is pressed into service by Spector to sing the song as a scratch vocal (Kelly van Hoose Smith provides \\"Cher\\"'s vocals). In fact Sonny Bono did not go to work for Spector until a year after the Paris Sisters' cut \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" and it was also in the autumn of 1962 that Bono and Cher first met. However, Cher did first work as a session vocalist in July 1963 when while visiting Bono at Gold Star Studios she was pressed into service by Spector to fill in for the unavailable Darlene Love to sing on the session for the Ronettes' \\"Be My Baby\\".

He was born in Bergen as the son of Julius Peder Voksø (1888–1937) and Gudrun Larssen (1891–1972). He took commerce school in 1941 and examen artium in 1944. In 1945 he started as a journalist in Bergen's Christian newspaper, Dagen. He participated at the foundation congress of the World Council of Churches in 1948. In the same year he married shipmaster's daughter Doris Paulsen. They got four children together. He was hired as subeditor of Vår Kirke in 1954, and Morgenposten in 1957. In late 1966 he was promoted to editor-in-chief. He succeeded Asbjørn Engen. However, shortly after the newspaper was bought by industrialist Sverre Munck. The previous owner was Libertas, a semi-secret libertarian organization. Voksø ran afoul with the new owner, and resigned after only three months in the editor's chair. He was succeeded by acting editor Gunnar Kristiansen. Until his retirement in 1986, Voksø worked as editor of publishing in Det Beste, the Norwegian version of the Reader's Digest. Voksø chaired YMCA Norway from 1955 to 1964 and was a member of the executive committee of the international YMCA from 1955 to 1961 and 1968 to 1974. In the World Council of Churches he was a member of the central committee and executive committee from 1983 to 1991. He was also active in the Lutheran World Federation. He chaired the Church of Norway National Council from 1970 to 1978 and the Church of Norway Council on Ecumenical and International Relations from 1986 to 1990, and had ecumenical concerns. In 1998 he received the Norwegian Ecumenical Prize. He was also a board member of the Church City Mission and Norwegian Church Aid, and chaired the latter organization from 1980 to 1986. All in all, he has been called \\"one of the most influential leaders within the Church of Norway\\" and \\"the most central layman in Norwegian post-war church life\\". In 1992 he was decorated as Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. He died in December 2002 in Oslo.

He was a commissioner in the negotiations between Britain and the United States at the drafting of the Treaty of Paris. Life Vaughan was born in Jamaica to Samuel Vaughan, a British banker and West India merchant planter of Irish Protestant descent, and his Anglo-American wife, Sarah Hallowell, daughter of shipbuilder, Benjamin Hallowell.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146643669 He was educated at Newcome's School and Warrington Academy and attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge, without graduating.Vaughan, Benjamin (1751-1835), of Finsbury Square, London. historyofparliamentonline.org He then studied Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. In 1785, during his stay in Edinburgh, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Allan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank, Dugald Stewart, and James Hutton. His broader long-term interest was in politics and sciences: the latter leading to his friendship with Benjamin Franklin.https://www.bartleby.com/1/1/4.html Vaughan was a political economist, merchant and medical doctor. Through Benjamin Horne, brother of John Horne, he met the politician Lord Shelburne.Edmond George Petty- Fitzmaurice, Baron Fitzmaurice, Life of William, Earl of Shelburne, afterwards first Marquess of Lansdowne vol. 2 (1912), p. 165 note 3; archive.org. Shelburne then used Vaughan in a diplomatic role, to try to bring peace between Great Britain and the United States, towards the end of the American War of Independence. He was also a middleman in reconciling Franklin and Shelburne. He was elected at a by-election in 1792 as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Calne in Wiltshire, and held the seat until the 1796 general election (however was absent from 1794). He spoke in parliament in strong defence of slavery in Jamaica, in his maiden speech. Allegations that by 1794 he was in favour of the abolition of the slave trade are unlikely. During his period in London he lived in Finsbury Square. He was arrested in 1794 on grounds of treason, regarding the supposed invasion of England by the French.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/vaughan- benjamin-1751-1835 After 1794, Vaughan left France for Switzerland and later to America. His interest in republicanism lead to his permanent departure from Britain. He settled in Boston and then on a farm in Hallowell, Maine in 1797. In 1802 he inherited further sugar and coffee plantations in the West Indies (and several hundred slaves) following the death of his father. A codicil in the will instructed the estates to be liquidated within 7 years and the funds invested in government stock. He did not meet this requirement. Benjamin was also instructed that the sums paid would deduct sums \\"owed\\" due to losses on the slave ships \\"Europa\\" and \\"Bella Juditta\\". He is thought to be the builder (or related to the builder) of Hallowell House in Boston, and it is possible his Jamaican links give rise to the district being called Jamaica Plain.https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:v405t118m In 1805, Vaughan was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1813, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In the Jamaican slave uprising of 1831 the huge family sugar estate of Flamstead, which he still co- owned with his siblings, was burnt to the ground and 407 slaves escaped. The smaller coffee estate of Vaughan's Field with 64 slaves was also destroyed. At its peak Flamstead had around 450 slaves, and Vaughansfield 79.

He was the son of Pierre-Louis de Blacas d'Aulps, 1st Duke of Blacas and of his wife Henriette-Marie-Félicité du Bouchet de Sourches de Montsoreau. His godfather was Louis XVIII, King of France. Born in London during the Hundred Days, he was educated first in France and then in Austria where his father had followed the exiled royal family in 1836. He returned in France only in 1844. He became an antiquarian like his father, inheriting and expanding his father's extraordinary collection of Greek vases, engraved gems and antique coins, cameos (including the famous Blacas Cameo of Augustus) and jewels. He was particularly interested in numismatics. He translated into French, under the title Histoire de la monnaie romaine (Paris 1866), the Geschichte des Römischen Münzwesens (History of Roman Coinage) of Theodor Mommsen (Berlin 1860), with additional notes signed B. The book is still often quoted using the Blacas translation rather than the original German version. Blacas was a member of the Societé des Antiquaires de France and served as its secretary from 1864 to 1865. After his father's death, Blacas defended him against allegations of unscrupulous gains made by the Duke of Ragusa.An extract of his letter to the editor of the Memoirs of the Duke of Ragusa is reproduced by Ponton d'Amécourt, p. 356-357. He fully supported his father's political views. Like his father, he was an ardent Legitimist. He succeeded him as a premier gentilhomme de la chambre to the exiled Legitimist claimant, the duc d'Angoulême. Blacas was a devoted follower of the duc d'Angoulême's successor, the comte de Chambord, whom he had known since childhood and whom he served all his life. His brother, Count Stanislas de Blacas d'Aulps, served the comte similarly. However, contrary to his father and to his own son (who later served as mayor and deputy), Blacas did not directly take part in the political life of the Second Empire. He died in Venice at the Palazzo Cavalli, the residence of the comte de Chambord, after planning a study of Venetian coinage. His body was taken back to Aups where his funeral took place. After the French government refused to pay for its acquisition, his collection was sold by his heirs to the British Museum in 1867 for 1,200,000 francs.British Museum Collection Marriages and issue The duke was married twice. Both wives were from Legitimist families of the French high nobility. He married first at Paris on 17 September 1845 Marie-Paule de Pérusse des Cars (3 February 1827, Paris - 18 September 1855, Pau), daughter of Amédée-François- Régis de Pérusse, 2nd Count and 1st Duke des Cars, Peer of France. They had four children: *Casimir de Blacas d'Aulps, 3rd Duke of Blacas, 3rd Prince of Blacas (23 October 1847 – 26 July 1866, Velletri). His life was representative of the engagements of French Legitimists of the time. A devout Catholic, he enrolled at 18 in the Papal Zouaves on 9 June 1866 to take part in the defense of the Papal States and went to Italy, but he died there from Typhoid the following month. He had been Duke only five months. *Louise-Henriette-Marie (7 July 1849, Abondant - 3 February 1934, Paris), married in Paris on 10 April 1872 with Count René Hurault de Vibraye (6 October 1842, Paris - 20 December 1907, Paris). *Marie-Augustine-Yvonne de Blacas d’Aulps (1 January 1851 – 21 Octobre 1881, Aressel, Austria), married on 14 June 1870 in Paris to Alexander, 4th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn (14 July 1847, Paris - 12 August 1940, Hachenburg). *Pierre de Blacas d'Aulps, 4th Duke of Blacas, 4th Prince of Blacas (27 May 1853, Paris – 13 December 1937 Beaupréau), succeeded his brother as Duke. He married on 30 August 1884 Honorine de Durfort-Civrac (26 November 1855 Beaupréau - 1 June 1920 Beaupréau), daughter of Marie-Henri- Louis de Durfort, 2d Marquis of Civrac (a cadet branch of Dukes of Lorge) and had posterity. On 28 July 1863, the Duke remarried with Alix-Laurence-Marie de Damas (1824–1879), daughter of Ange-Hyacinthe de Damas de Cormaillon, 1st Baron of Damas, Peer of France, who had been Minister of foreign affairs (1823–1828) and Minister of war (1823–1824) of Charles X. They had only one daughter: *Marie-Thérèse de Blacas d'Aulps (22 July 1864, Verignon – 8 February 1959, Aups).

A schoolteacher and inspector of Aromanian education within Ottoman lands, he established his reputation as a journalist before 1908. During his thirties, he joined the clandestine revolutionary movement known as the Young Turks, serving as its liaison with Aromanian factions. The victorious Young Turk Revolution brought Batzaria to the forefront of Ottoman politics, ensuring him a seat in the Ottoman Senate, and he briefly served as Minister of Public Works under the Three Pashas. He was tasked with several diplomatic missions, including attending the London Conference of 1913, but, alerted by the Three Pashas' World War I alliances and the Young Turks' nationalism, he soon after quit the Ottoman political scene and left into voluntary exile. Batzaria eventually settled in Romania and became a prolific contributor to Romanian letters, producing works of genre fiction and children's literature. Together with comic strip artist Marin Iorda, he created Haplea, one of the most popular characters in early Romanian comics. Batzaria also collected and retold fairy tales from various folkloric traditions, while publishing original novels for adolescents and memoirs of his life in Macedonia. A member of the Romanian Senate for one term, he was active on the staff of Romania's leading left-wing journals, Adevărul and Dimineața, as well as founder of the latter's supplement for children, before switching his allegiance to the right-wing Universul. Batzaria was persecuted and imprisoned by the communist regime, and spent his final years in obscure captivity. Biography Early life and activities Batzaria was a native of Kruševo (Crushuva), a village in Ottoman-ruled Monastir region, presently in North Macedonia. His Aromanian family had numerous branches outside that region: migrant members had settled in the Kingdom of Romania, in Anatolia, and in the Khedivate of Egypt.Zbuchea (1999), p. 79 Nicolae grew up in Kruševo, where he studied under renowned Aromanian teacher Sterie Cosmescu. He later attended a high school sponsored by the Kingdom of Romania in Bitola, and later the Faculties of Letters and Law at the University of Bucharest.Karpat, p. 563; Zbuchea (1999), pp. 62–63, 79. See also Batzaria (1942), pp. 37–39 \\"Batzaria Nicolae\\" , biographical note in Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914) database, at the University of Florence's Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved August 19, 2009 Eduard Antonian, \\"Turcia, Junii Turci și armenii în memoriile lui Nicolae Batzaria\\", in the Armenian-Romanian community's Ararat, Nr. 8/2003, p. 6 The young man became a dedicated disciple of Romanian nationalist theorist Nicolae Iorga, who was inaugurating his lectures in History during Batzaria's first year there.Batzaria (1942), pp. 37–38 He notably shared Iorga's belief, consolidated with time, that the Aromanians were not an isolated Balkan ethnicity, but part of larger Romanian ethnic community. As he himself explained, \\"the Romanian people [is] a unitary and indivisible body, regardless of the region wherein historical circumstances have settled it\\", and the \\"Macedonian Romanians\\" constituted \\"the most aloof branch of the Romanian trunk\\".Batzaria (1942), p. 41 Lacking funds for his tuition, Batzaria never graduated. Instead, he earned his recognition as a journalist, educator and analyst. A polyglot, he could speak Turkish, Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian and French, in addition to his native Aromanian and the related Romanian language.Karpat, p. 563 Literary critic and memoirist Barbu Cioculescu, who befriended Batzaria as a child, recalls that the Aromanian journalist \\"spoke all Balkan languages\\", and \\"perfect Romanian\\" with a \\"brittle\\" accent. Barbu Cioculescu, \\"Soarele Cotrocenilor\\", in Litere, Nr. 2/2011, p. 11 While in Romania, Batzaria also began his collaboration with Romanian journals: Adevărul, Dimineața, Flacăra, Arhiva, Ovidiu and Gândul Nostru.Zbuchea (1999), p. 82 Also notable is his work with magazines published by the Aromanian diaspora. These publications depicted the Aromanians as a subgroup of the Romanian people.Zbuchea (1999), pp. 81–82 They include Peninsula Balcanică (\\"The Balkan Peninsula\\", the self-styled \\"Organ for the Romanian interests in the Orient\\"), Macedonia and Frățilia (\\"Brotherhood\\"). The latter, published from both Bitola and Bucharest, and then from the Macedonian metropolis of Thessaloniki, had Nicolae Papahagi and Nushi Tulliu on its editorial board.Gică, p. 6 Batzaria made his editorial debut with a volume of anecdotes, Părăvulii (printed in Bucharest in 1901). Batzaria returned to Macedonia as a schoolteacher, educating children at the Ioannina school, and subsequently at his alma mater in Bitola.Karpat, p. 563; Zbuchea (1999), pp. 79–80 In 1899, he and his colleagues notably persuaded Take Ionescu, the Romanian Education Minister, to allocate some 724,000 lei as a grant to Macedonian schools, and virulently protested when later governments halved this annual income.Zbuchea (1999), p. 80 He afterward became chief inspector of the Romanian educational institutions in the Ottoman provinces of Kosovo and Salonika.Hanioğlu, p. 259; Karpat, p. 563; Zbuchea (1999), pp. 79, 82 Historian Gheorghe Zbuchea, who researched the self-identification of Aromanians as a Romanian subgroup, sees Batzaria as \\"the most important representative of the national Romanian movement\\" among early 20th century Ottoman residents,Gheorghe Zbuchea, \\"Varieties of Nationalism and National Ideas in Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Southeastern Europe\\", in Răzvan Theodorescu, Leland Conley Barrows (eds.), Studies on Science and Culture. Politics and Culture in Southeastern Europe, UNESCO-CEPES, Bucharest, 2001, p. 247. and \\"without doubt one of the most complex personalities illustrating the history of trans-Danubian Romanianism\\". Batzaria's debut in Macedonian cultural debates came at a turning point: through her political representatives, Romania was reexamining the scope of her involvement in the Macedonian question, and asserting that it held no ambition to annex Aromanian land.Zbuchea (1999), pp. 63–65 Map showing the distribution of Romanian- sponsored school in the Balkans, 1899. Regions with 20 or more such institutions are colored in dark green, and concentrated around Monastir region From Macedonia, Nicolae Batzaria became a correspondent of Neamul Românesc, a brochure and later magazine published in Romania by his mentor Nicolae Iorga. At that stage, Batzaria, with Tulliu, Nicolae Papahagi and Pericle Papahagi, founded the Association of Educationists in Service to the Romanian People of Turkey (that is, the Aromanians), a union of professionals based in Bitola. They were on mission to Romania, where their demand for more funding sparked lively debates among Romanian politicians, but Education Minister Spiru Haret eventually signed off a special Macedonian fund, worth 600,000 lei (later increased to over 1 million).Zbuchea (1999), pp. 80–81 The group was also granted a private audience with King Carol I, who showed sympathy for the Aromanian campaign and agreed to receive Batzaria on several other occasions. Perceived as a figure of importance among the Aromanian delegates, Batzaria also began his collaboration with the magazine Sămănătorul, chaired at the time by Iorga.Zbuchea (1999), pp. 80, 81. See also Batzaria (1942), p. 41 Lumina, Deșteptarea and Young Turks affiliation Nicolae Batzaria's nationalism, aimed specifically against the Greeks, became more evident in 1903, when he founded the Bucharest gazette Românul de la Pind (\\"The Romanian of the Pindus\\"). It was published under the motto Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes, and monitored the Greek offensive against Aromanian institutions in places such as Muloviști, calling out for action against the \\"perfidious\\" and \\"inhumane\\" enemy.Gică, p. 7 In 1905, Batzaria's paper fused into Revista Macedoniei (\\"Macedonia Magazine\\"), put out by a league of exiles, the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society. Batzaria and his colleagues in Bitola put out Lumina (\\"The Light\\"). A self-styled \\"popular magazine for the Romanians of the Ottoman Empire\\", it divided its content into a \\"clean\\" Romanian and a smaller Aromanian section, aiming to show \\"the kinship of these two languages\\", and arguing that \\"dialects are preserved, but not cultivated.\\"Gică, pp. 6–7 Batzaria became, in 1904, its editorial director, taking over from founder Dumitru Cosmulei. Lumina was the first Aromanian magazine to be published within the lands of Rumelia (Turkey-in-Europe), and espoused a cultural agenda without political objectives, setting up the first popular library for Aromanian- and Romanian-speakers of Macedonian descent.Zbuchea (1999), pp. 58, 81. See also Gică, pp. 6–7 However, the Association of Educationists stated explicitly that its goal was to elevate the \\"national and religious sentiment\\" among \\"the Romanian people of the Ottoman Empire\\".Zbuchea (1999), p. 81 Lumina was noted for its better quality, receiving a 2,880 lei grant from Romania's government, but was no longer in print by late 1908. Following a ban on political activities by Sultan Abdul Hamid II, Batzaria was arrested by local Ottoman officials, and experience which later served him in writing the memoir În închisorile turcești (\\"In Turkish Prisons\\").Karpat, pp. 567–568 In May 1905, the Ottoman ruler decided to give recognition to some Aromanian demands, principally their recognition as a distinct entity within the imperial borders.Gică, p. 8; Zbuchea, pp. 67, 72–73, 84, 85, 90, 94–95, 116, 139, 142, 191–192, 241, 265 Batzaria's contribution in the press was diversified in later years. With discreet help from Romanian officials, he and Nicolae Papahagi founded, in Thessaloniki, the French-language sheet Courrier des Balkans (\\"Balkan Dispatch\\", published from 1904).Zbuchea (1999), p. 82. See also Gică, pp. 7–8 It was specifically designed as a propaganda sheet for the Aromanian cause, informing its international readership about the Latin origins and philo-Romanian agenda of Aromanian nationalism.Gică, pp. 7–8 He also worked on, or helped found, other Aromanian organs in the vernacular, including Glasul Macedoniei (\\"The Macedonian Voice\\") and Grai Bun (\\"The Good Speech\\"). Late in 1906, Revista Macedoniei turned back into Românul de la Pind, struggling to survive as a self-funded national tribune. Batzaria also replaced N. Macedoneanu as Grai Bun editor in 1907, but the magazine was under-financed and went bankrupt the same year. His Romanian articles were still published in Iorga's Neamul Românesc, but also in the rival journal Viața Românească. In 1908, Batzaria founded what is seen by some as the first ever Aromanian-language newspaper, Deșteptarea (\\"The Awakening\\"), again from Thessaloniki. Agenda Armâneascâ , at Radio Romania International, April 14, 2009; retrieved August 20, 2009 The next year, it received a sponsorship of 6,000 lei from the Romanian government, and began agitating for the introduction of Aromanian classes in Ottoman primary schools. Nevertheless, Deșteptarea went out of business in 1910. Beginning 1907, Batzaria took a direct interest in the development of revolutionary conspiracies which aimed to reshape the Ottoman Empire from within. Having first came in contact with İsmail Enver, he thereafter affiliated with the multi-ethnic Committee of Union and Progress, a clandestine core of the Young Turks movement.Karpat, p. 563; Zbuchea (1999), pp. 78–79, 82–84 According to his own statements, he was acquainted with figures at the forefront of the Young Turks organizations: Mehmed Talat, Ahmed Djemal (the future \\"Three Pashas\\", alongside Enver), Mehmet Cavit Bey, Hafiz Hakki and others.Karpat, pp. 563, 569. See also Zbuchea (1999), pp. 79, 83–84 This was partly backed by Enver's notes in his diary, which includes the mention: \\"I was instrumental in bringing into the Society the first Christian members. For instance Basarya effendi.\\"Karpat, p. 569 Batzaria himself claimed to have been initiated into the society by Djemal and following a ritual similar to that of \\"nihilists\\" in the Russian Empire: an oath on a revolver placed inside a poorly lit room, while guarded by men dressed in black and red cloth. Supposedly, Batzaria also joined the Freemasonry at some point in his life. Modern Turkish historian Kemal H. Karpat connects these events with a larger Young Turks agenda of attracting Aromanians into a political alliance, in contrast to the official policies of the rival Balkan states, all of which refused to recognize the Aromanian ethnicity as distinct.Karpat, pp. 571–572 Zbuchea passed a similar judgment, concluding: \\"Balkan Romanians actively supported the actions of the Young Turks, believing that they provided good opportunities for modernization and perhaps guarantees regarding their future.\\" Another Turkish researcher, M. Şükrü Hanioğlu, looks at the alliance from the point of view of a larger dispute between Greece (and the Greeks in Ottoman lands) on one hand, and, on the other, Ottoman leaders and their Aromanian subjects. Proposing that Aromanian activists, like their Albanian counterparts, \\"supported the preservation of Ottoman rule in Macedonia\\" primarily for fear of the Greeks, Hanioğlu highlights the part played by British mediators in fostering the Ottoman-Aromanian entente.Hanioğlu, pp. 259–260 He notes that, \\"with the exception of the Jews\\", Aromanians were the only non-Islamic community to be drawn into the Ottomanist projects.Hanioğlu, p. 260 Ottoman senator and minister Postcard celebrating the victory of the Young Turk Revolution, with a portrait of İsmail Enver and patriotic slogans in Ottoman Turkish and French In 1908, the Aromanian intellectual was propelled to high office by the Young Turk Revolution and the Second Constitutional Era: the party rewarded his contribution, legally interpreted as \\"high services to the State\\", by assigning him a special non-elective seat in the Ottoman Senate (a status similar to that of another Young Turk Aromanian, Filip Mișea, who became a deputy).Hanioğlu, p. 259; Karpat, pp. 563, 569, 571, 576–577. See also Zbuchea (1999), pp. 78–79, 83–84 As Zbuchea notes, Batzaria was unqualified for the office, as he was neither forty years old nor a distinguished bureaucrat, and only owed his promotion to his conspiratorial background.Zbuchea (1999), pp. 83–84, 283 By then, Batzaria is said to have also become a personal friend of the new sultan, Mehmed V, and of Education Minister Abdurrahman Şeref, who reportedly shared his reverence for Nicolae Iorga.Batzaria (1942), pp. 38–39 A regular contributor to Le Jeune Turc and other newspapers based in Constantinople (now Istanbul), the Aromanian campaigner was also appointed vice-president of the Turkish Red Crescent, a humanitarian society, which provided him with close insight into the social contribution of Muslim women volunteers, and, through extension, an understanding of Islamic feminism.Karpat, pp. 563–564 The next few years were a period of maximal autonomy for Mehmed's Aromanian subjects, who could elect their own local government, eagerly learned Ottoman Turkish, and, still committed to Ottomanism, were promoted within the bureaucratic corps.Zbuchea (1999), pp. 84–99, 109 The community was still dissatisfied with various issues, most of all their automatic inclusion in the millet of Ottoman Greeks. Batzaria was personally becoming involved in a dispute with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, campaigning among the Turks for the recognition of a separate Aromanian bishopric.Zbuchea (1999), pp. 83, 99–101, 143–144, 146, 155 The failure of this project, like the underrepresentation of Aromanians in the Senate, caused some of Batzaria's fellow activists to feel disgruntled.Zbuchea (1999), pp. 100–101, 155–156 In 1912, during the First Balkan War, the partition of Macedonia put a stop to Românul de la Pind, which closed down at the same time as other Aromanian nationalist papers.Gică, pp. 7, 8 However, Batzaria's political career was advanced further by Enver's military coup: he became Minister of Public Works in Enver's cabinet, but without interrupting his journalistic activities.Hanioğlu, p. 468; Karpat, p. 564. See also Zbuchea (1999), pp. 83, 84 It was also he who represented the executive at the London Conference, where he acknowledged the Ottoman defeat.Karpat, pp. 564, 569–570; Zbuchea (1999), p. 79\\"Gobbles\\" (with biographical notes), in Plural Magazine, Nr. 30/2007 Against the law which specified that members of the Ottoman executive could not serve in the Senate, Batzaria did not lose his seat.Zbuchea (1999), p. 84 As was later revealed, he continued to act as a partisan of Romanian policies, and sent secret reports to his friend, King Carol I of Romania. In early 1914, Le Jeune Turc published his praise for Iorga and the Bucharest Institute of South-East European Studies. \\"Informațiuni\\", in Românul (Arad), Nr. 32/1914, p. 8 As Ottoman administrators were being expelled from the Balkans, Batzaria and fellow Aromanian intellectuals tended to support the doomed project of an independent, multi-ethnic, Macedonia.Zbuchea (1999), pp. 109–110 In the short peaceful hiatus which followed his return from London, Batzaria represented the empire in secret talks with Romania's Titu Maiorescu government, negotiating a new alliance against the victorious Kingdom of Bulgaria.Karpat, pp. 564, 580; Zbuchea (1999), pp. 108–109. See also Hanioğlu, p. 468 As he himself recalled, the request was refused by Romanian politicians, who stated that they wished to avoid attacking other Christian nations.Karpat, p. 580; Zbuchea (1999), p. 109 The Ottoman approach however resonated with Romania's intentions, and both states eventually defeated Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War.Karpat, pp. 564, 580 Relocation to Romania The following years brought a clash of interests between the Three Pashas and Batzaria. Already alarmed by the officialized Turkification process,Karpat, pp. 577–584 the Aromanian intellectual proved himself an opponent of the new policies which linked the Ottoman realm to the German Empire, Bulgaria and the other Central Powers.Karpat, p. 564 In 1916, two years into World War I, he left Constantinople for neutral Switzerland.Karpat, p. 564; Zbuchea (1999), p. 84 He was by then a correspondent for Iorga's new magazine, Ramuri. Nicolae Batzaria eventually resettled in Bucharest. He embarked on a career in writing, publishing a succession of fiction and nonfiction volumes in Romanian. He was, in January 1919, a co-founder of Greater Romania's original journalists' trade union (Union of Professional Journalists), G. Brătescu, \\"Uniunea Ziariștilor Profesioniști, 1919 - 2009. Compendiu aniversar\\", in Mesagerul de Bistrița-Năsăud, December 11, 2009 and, in 1921, published his În închisorile turcești with Editura Alcaly. D. I. Cucu, \\"Cărți și reviste. N. Batzaria, În închisorile turcești\\", in Gândirea, Nr. 11/1921, p. 211 He later produced a series of books detailing the lives of women in the Ottoman Empire and the modern Turkish state: Spovedanii de cadâne. Nuvele din viața turcească (\\"Confessions of Turkish Odalisques. Novellas from Turkish Life\\", 1921), Turcoaicele (\\"The Turkish Women\\", 1921), Sărmana Lila. Roman din viața cadânelor (\\"Poor Leila. A Novel from the Life of Odalisques\\", 1922), Prima turcoaică (\\"The First of Turkish Women\\", n.d.), as well as several translations of foreign books on this subject.Karpat, p. 567 One of his stories about Ottoman womanhood, Vecina dela San-Stefano (\\"The Neighbor of Yeşilköy\\"), was published by the literary review Gândirea in its June 1922 issue. N. Batzaria, \\"Vecina dela San-Stefano\\", in Gândirea, Nr. 5/1922, pp. 90–93 Around the same time, the Viața Românească publishers issued his booklet România văzută de departe (\\"Romania Seen from a Distance\\"), a book of essays which sought to revive confidence and self-respect among Romanian citizens. D. I. Cucu, \\"Cărți și reviste. N. Batzaria, România văzută de departe\\", in Gândirea, Nr. 4/1922, pp. 80–81 A member of the People's Party, Batzaria served a term in the Senate of Greater Romania (coinciding with Alexandru Averescu's term as Premier).Karpat, p. 564; Zbuchea (1999), p. 79 By 1926, he had rallied with the opposition Romanian National Party (PNR). Included in its Permanent Delegation together with his old acquaintance Nicolae Iorga, he approved of PNR's fusion with the Romanian Peasantists, affiliating with the resulting National Peasants' Party (PNȚ). \\"Frontul Democratic\\", in Chemarea Tinerimei Române, Nr. 23/1926, p. 23 He also participated in meetings of the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians (presided upon by Iorga), including a 1929 rally in Cluj city. Șt. Peneș, \\"Jos masca Domnule Batzaria!\\", in Înfrățirea Românească, Nr. 19/1929, pp. 221–222 Dimineața Copiilor 30th issue (1924). Cover by Victor Ion Popa During the interwar period, he also became a regular contributor to the country's main left-wing dailies: Adevărul and Dimineața. The journals' owners assigned Batzaria with the task of managing and editing a junior version of Dimineața, Dimineața Copiilor (\\"The Children's Morning\\"). Story goes that he was not just managing the supplement, but in effect writing down most content for each issue. Ștefan Cazimir, \\"Dimineața copilului\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 19/2004 While at Adevărul, Batzaria stood accused by right-wing competitors of excessively promoting the National Peasantist leader Iuliu Maniu in view of the 1926 election. A nationalist newspaper, Țara Noastră, argued that Batzaria's political columns were effectively coaching the public to vote PNȚ, and mocked their author as \\"a former Young Turk and ministerial colleague of that famous [İsmail] Enver- bey\\". Alexandru Hodoș, \\"Însemnări. Însușiri profesionale\\", in Țara Noastră, Nr. 13/1926, p. 423 Like the PNȚ, the Adevărul journalist proposed the preservation of communal and regional autonomy in Greater Romania, denouncing centralization schemes as \\"ferocious reactionarism\\".Marilena Oana Nedelea, Alexandru Nedelea, \\"Law of 24 June 1925 – Administrative Unification Law. Purpose, Goals, Limits\\", in the Ștefan cel Mare University of Suceava's Annals (Fascicle of The Faculty of Economics and Public Administration), Nr. 1 (13)/2011, p. 346 A while after, Batzaria drew attention to himself for writing, in Dimineața, about the need to protect the religious and communal liberties of the Jewish minority. The National-Christian Defense League, an antisemitic political faction, reacted strongly against his arguments, accusing Batzaria of having \\"sold his soul\\" to the Jewish owners of Adevărul, and to \\"kike interests\\" in general. The year 1928 saw Batzaria protesting against the escalation of violence against journalists. His Adevărul piece was prompted by a brawl at the offices of Curentul daily, as well as by attacks on provincial newspapers.Petcu, p. 60 The Haplea years Batzaria still maintained an interest in propagating the cause of Aromanians. The interwar years saw him joining the General Board of the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society, of which he was for a while President. Traian D. Lazăr, \\"Din istoricul Societății de Cultură Macedo-române\\", in Revista Română (ASTRA), Nr. 3/2011, pp. 23–24 He was one of the high-level Aromanian intellectuals who issued public protests when, in 1924, the Greek Gendarmes organized a crackdown against Aromanian activism in Pindus. Delavardar, \\"Raiul aromânilor\\", in Cultura Poporului, Nr. 6/1924, p. 1 In 1927, Societatea de Mâine journal featured one of Batzaria's studies on the ethnic minorities of the Balkans, where he contrasted the persecution of Aromanians in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia with their \\"unexpected\\" toleration in Greece. N. Batzaria, \\"Minoritățile etnice din Peninsula Balcanică\\", in Societatea de Mâine, Nr. 25–26, June–July 1927, pp. 323–325 In 1928, Batzaria was a judge for a national Miss Romania beauty contest, organized by Realitatea Ilustrată magazine and journalist Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș (the other members of this panel being female activist Alexandrina Cantacuzino, actress Maria Giurgea, politician Alexandru Mavrodi, novelist Liviu Rebreanu and visual artists Jean Alexandru Steriadi and Friedrich Storck). Dumitru Hîncu, \\"Al. Tzigara-Samurcaș - Din amintirile primului vorbitor la Radio românesc\\", in România Literară, Nr. 42/2007 As an Adevărul journalist, Batzaria nevertheless warned against politically militant feminism and women's suffrage, urging women to find their comfort in marriage.Maria Bucur, \\"Romania\\", in Kevin Passmore (ed.), Women, Gender, and Fascism in Europe, 1919-45, Manchester University Press, Manchester, 2003, p. 72. Speaking in 1930, he suggested that the idea of a feminist party in gender-biased Romania was absurd, arguing that women could either support their husbands' political activities or, at most, affiliate with the existing parties. \\"Ancheta ziarului Universul 'Să se înscrie femeile în partidele politice?', Ziarul Nostru, anul IV, nr. 2, februarie 1930\\", in Ștefania Mihăilescu, Din istoria feminismului românesc: studiu și antologie de texte (1929-1948), Polirom, Iași, 2006, p. 116. Batzaria's work in children's literature, taking diverse forms, was often published under the pen names Moș Nae (\\"Old Man Nae\\", a term of respect applied to the hypocorism of Nicolae) and Ali Baba (after the eponymous character in One Thousand and One Nights).Batzaria (1987), passim; Karpat, p. 564 Another variant he favored was Moș Ene.Mihaela Cernăuți-Gorodețchi, notes to Hans Christian Andersen, 14 povești nemuritoare, Institutul European, Iași, 2005, pp. 20, 54, 78, 103. By 1925, Batzaria had created the satirical character Haplea (or \\"Gobbles\\"), whom he made into a protagonist for some of Romania's first comic strips. Maria Bercea, \\"Incursiune în universul BD\\" , in Adevărul, June 29, 2008Ioana Calen, \\"Cărtărescu e tras în bandă - Provocarea desenată\\", in Cotidianul, June 13, 2006 Alex Aciobăniței, \\"Filmul românesc între 1905–1948 (18). Arta animației nu a început cu Gopo!\\", in Timpul, Nr. 72/2004, p. 23 A Christmas 1926 volume, comprising 73 Haplea stories, was welcomed at the time as one of the best books for children. Ion Băilă, \\"Literatură pentru copii. Haplea de N. Batzaria\\", in Societatea de Mâine, Nr. 49–50, December 1926, p. 766 Other characters created by Batzaria in various literary genres include Haplina (the female version and regular companion of Haplea), Hăplișor (their child), Lir and Tibișir (known together as doi isteți nătăfleți, \\"two clever gawks\\"), and Uitucilă (from a uita, \\"to forget\\").Iuteș, in Batzaria (1987), p. 3 The graphics to Batzaria's rhymed captions were provided by caricaturist Marin Iorda, who also worked on a cinema version of Haplea (one of the first samples of Romanian animation). It was a compendium of the Dimineața comics, with both Iorda and Batzaria (the credited screenwriter) drawn in as supporting characters. Premiered in December 1927 at Cinema Trianon of Bucharest, it had been in production for almost a year. From 1929, Batzaria also took over as editor and host of the children's show Ora Copiilor, on National Radio.Mușețeanu, pp. 41–42 This collaboration lasted until 1932, during which time Batzaria also gave radio conferences on Oriental subjects (historical Istanbul, the Albanian Revolt of 1912 and the Quran) or on various other topics. By 1930, when he attended the First Balkan Conference as a member of its Intellectual Committee,Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa, \\"Prima Conferință Interbalcanică\\", in Arhiva pentru Știință și Reformă Socială, Nr. 1-3/1930, p. 394 Batzaria had become known for his genre fiction novels, addressed to a general public and registering much success. Among these were Jertfa Lilianei (\\"Liliana's Sacrifice\\"), Răpirea celor două fetițe (\\"The Kidnapping of the Two Little Girls\\"), Micul lustragiu (\\"The Little Shoeshiner\\") and Ina, fetița prigonită (\\"Ina, the Persecuted Little Girl\\").Matei Călinescu, Ion Vianu, Amintiri în dialog. Memorii, Polirom, Iași, 2005, p. 76. His main fairy tale collection was published as Povești de aur (\\"Golden Stories\\").Batzaria (1987), passim Also in 1930, he worked state-approved textbooks for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th grades, co-authored with P. Puchianu and D. Stoica and published by Scrisul Românesc of Craiova. \\"Cărți școlare\\", in Învățătorul, Special Issue, August 20, 1930, p. 37 In addition, Batzaria took to the applied study of philology. In September 1933, he commented in Adevărul about the Romani minority and its first efforts at community representation. A sympathizer of the cause, he declared himself puzzled that these organizations still used the exonym țigani (\\"Gypsies\\"); his arguments may have inspired activist Gheorghe A. Lăzăreanu-Lăzurică, who set up his own General Union of Roma in Romania.Petre Matei, \\"Romi sau țigani? Etnonimele – istoria unei neînțelegeri\\", in István Horváth, Lucian Nastasă (eds.), Rom sau Țigan: dilemele unui etnonim în spațiul românesc, Institutul pentru Studierea Problemelor Minorităților Naționale, Cluj-Napoca, 2012, pp. 59–60, 62. Batzaria's other work took the form of literary studies: he reportedly consulted researcher Șerban Cioculescu about the Balkan origins of classical Romanian dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale. His interest in Oriental themes also touched his reviews of works by other writers, such as his 1932 essay on the Arabic and Persian motifs reused by Caragiale in the Kir Ianulea story. Florentina Tone, \\"Scriitorii de la Adevĕrul\\", in Adevărul, December 30, 2008 Caragiale's acquaintance with Ottoman sources was also the subject of Batzaria's last known radio conference, aired in August 1935.Mușețeanu, p. 42 A few months later, Batzaria was appointed Commissioner of the \\"Bucharest Month\\" Exhibit, organized with official support and attended by Romanian King Carol II.Illustration 11, in Boia Right-wing radical sympathies Batzaria as Commissioner of Luna Bucureștilor cultural festival, 1936 (left). With him, Alexandru Donescu, the Mayor of Bucharest, and the uniform-wearing King Carol II In mid 1936, Batzaria parted with Dimineața and joined its right-wing and nationalist rival, Universul, becoming Universul publisher.Boia, pp. 66–67, 70; Karpat, p. 564 He was then appointed editor of Universul Copiilor (\\"Children's Universe\\"), the Universul youth magazine, which took up his Haplea stories and comics. According to literary critic Gabriel Dimisianu, who was a fan of the magazine in his boyhood, Universul Copiilor was \\"very good\\". Mircea Iorgulescu, Gabriel Dimisianu, \\"Prim-plan Gabriel Dimisianu. 'Noi n-am crezut că se va termina' \\" , in Vatra, Nr. 3–4/2005, p. 69 Batzaria also switched to National Liberal Party politics, and represented the National Liberal group on the General Council of Bucharest. Barbu Cioculescu, \\"Cum se citește un dicționar\\", in Luceafărul, Nr. 33/2011 At Universul, he became involved in political disputes facing the leftists and rightists, siding with the latter. As observed by historian Lucian Boia, this was a common enough tendency among the Aromanian elite and, as Batzaria himself put it in one of his Universul texts, was read as a \\"strengthening of the Romanian element.\\"Boia, p. 66 The writer also became directly involved in the conflict opposing Universul and Adevărul, during which the latter was accused of being a tool for \\"communism\\". He urged the authorities to repress what he argued was a communist conspiracy, led by his former employers.Hans-Christian Maner, Parlamentarismus in Rumänien (1930-1940): Demokratie im autoritären Umfeld, R. Oldenbourg Verlag, Munich, 1997, pp. 323–324. In manifest contrast to Adevărul, and in agreement with Romanian fascists, Batzaria supported the Italian invasion of Abyssinia as a step forward for \\"that sound and creative Latin civilization.\\"Boia, pp. 66–67 Batzaria also expressed sympathy toward the fascist and antisemitic \\"Iron Guard\\" movement. This political attitude touched his editorial pieces concerning the Spanish Civil War. He marked the death of Iron Guardist politico Ion Moța, in service to the Francoist side, likening him to heroes such as Giuseppe Garibaldi and Lafayette (see Funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin).Valentin Săndulescu, \\"La puesta en escena del martirio: La vida política de dos cadáveres. El entierro de los líderes rumanos legionarios Ion Moța y Vasile Marin en febrero de 1937\\", in Jesús Casquete, Rafael Cruz (eds.), Políticas de la muerte. Usos y abusos del ritual fúnebre en la Europa del siglo XX, Catarata, Madrid, 2009, pp. 260, 264. Batzaria was nevertheless marginalized for the larger part of World War II, when Romania came under successive fascist regimes (the Iron Guard's National Legionary State and the authoritarian system of Conducător Ion Antonescu). He was still featured and reviewed in an issue of Familia magazine, where he discussed the loss of Northern Transylvania, and compared the plight of its inhabitants with that of the Aromanians. N. Batzaria, \\"Ardeleni și Macedoneni\\", in Familia, Nr. 1/1941, pp. 19–23 His 50th book of stories also saw print, as Regina din Insula Piticilor (\\"The Queen of Dwarf Island\\"), set to coincide with Christmas 1940. Marieta Popescu, \\"Note. Regina din Insula Piticilor\\", in Familia, Nr. 1/1941, pp. 103–104 He also put out the Universul children's almanac. Marieta Popescu, \\"Revista revistelor. Calendarul Universul Copiilor 1941\\", in Familia, Nr. 1/1941, p. 112 In 1942, after the Guard's downfall, Familia published a posthumous homage to Nicolae Iorga, who had been assassinated by the Guard in 1940.Batzaria (1942), passim From November 1942, Universul hosted a new series of his political articles, on the subject of \\"Romanians Abroad\\". Reflecting the Antonescu regime's rekindled interest in the Aromanian issue, these offered advice on standardizing the official Aromanian dialect.Zbuchea (1999), pp. 219–220 In addition to his work as editor, Batzaria focused on translating stories by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, which saw print under the Moș Ene signature in stages between 1942 and 1944. Under the same pen name, he published the 1943 Lacrimile mamei (\\"Mother's Tears\\"), a \\"novel for children and the youth\\".George Baiculescu, \\"Cronica bibliografică. Cărți pentru copii\\", in Revista Fundațiilor Regale, Nr. 2/1944, p. 450 At around that time, Universul Copillor began contributing to Antonescu's propaganda effort, supporting Romania's Eastern Front efforts, against the Soviet Union. Cristina Diac, \\"Comunism - Avem crime! Vrem criminali!\\", in Jurnalul Național, April 11, 2006Lucian Vasile, \\"Tudorică și Andrei, eroi ai propagandei de război\\", in Magazin Istoric, March 2011, pp. 80–82 With its comics and its editorial content, the magazine spearheaded a xenophobic campaign, targeting the Frenchified culture of the upper class, ridiculing the Hungarians of Northern Transylvania, and portraying the Soviets as savages. Persecution and death The war's end and the rise of the Communist Party made Batzaria a direct target for political persecution. Shortly after the August 23 Coup, the communist press began targeting Batzaria with violent rhetoric, calling for his exclusion from the Romanian Writers' Society (or SSR): \\"in 1936, when Ana Pauker stood trial, [Batzaria] joined the enemies of the people, grouped under Stelian Popescu's quilt at Universul, instigating in favor of racial hatred\\".Victor Frunză, Istoria stalinismului în România, Humanitas, Bucharest, 1990, p. 251. The party organ, Scînteia, identified Universul Copiilor as a \\"fascist and anti-Soviet\\" publication, noting: \\"The traitor Batzaria, aka Moș Nae, should be aware that there is no longer a place for him in today's Romanian media.\\" Batzaria was stripped of his SSR membership in the early months of 1945,Boia, p. 264 and, in 1946, Universul Copiilor was suppressed. The consolidation of a communist regime in 1947-1948 led to his complete ostracizing, beginning when he was forced out of his house by the authorities (an action which reportedly caused the destruction of all his manuscripts through neglect). Sources diverge on events occurring during Batzaria's final years. Several authors mention that he became a political prisoner of the communists. Nicolae Dima, Constantin Mătasă, \\"Viața neobișnuită a unui om de știință român refugiat în Statele Unite\\", in the Canadian Association of Romanian Writers Destine Literare, Nr. 8–9 (16–17), January–February 2011, p. 71Boia, p. 312; Eugenio Coșeriu, Johannes Kabatek, Adolfo Murguía, »Die Sachen sagen, wie sie sind...«. Eugenio Coșeriu im Gespräch, Gunter Narr Verlag, Tübingen, 1997, p. 11. ; Zbuchea (1999), p. 79 According to Karpat, Batzaria died in poverty at his Bucharest house during the early 1950s. Later research however suggests that this occurred in 1952, at a concentration camp. The most specific such sources mentions that his life ended at a penal facility located in Bucharest's Ghencea district. Scientist Claudiu Mătasă, who shared his cell there, recalled: \\"His stomach ill, [Batzaria] basically died in my arms, with me taking as much care of him as circumstances would allow...\\" Barbu Cioculescu gives a more complex account: \\"In very old age [Batzaria] was arrested, not for being a right-wing man, as he had not in fact been one, but for having served as a city councilor. A spinal cancer sufferer, he died in detention [...] not long after having been sentenced\\". According to historian of journalism Marin Petcu, Batzaria's confinement was effectively a political assassination.Petcu, p. 59 Work Fiction Anthumous editions of Nicolae Constantin Batzaria's work include some 30 volumes, covering children's, fantasy and travel literature, memoirs, novels, textbooks, translations and various reports.Karpat, p. 565 According to his profile at the University of Florence Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures, Batzaria was \\"lacking in originality but a talented vulgarizer\\". Writing in 1987, children's author Gica Iuteș claimed that the \\"most beautiful pages\\" in Batzaria's work were those dedicated to the youth, making Batzaria \\"a great and modest friend of the children\\". His short stories for children generally build on ancient fairy tales and traditional storytelling techniques. A group among these accounts retell classics of Turkish, Arabic and Persian literatures (such as One Thousand and One Nights), intertwined with literary styles present throughout the Balkans. This approach to Middle Eastern themes was complemented by borrowings from Western and generally European sources, as well as from the Far East. The Povești de aur series thus includes fairy tales from European folklore and Asian folktales: Indian (Savitri and Satyavan), Spanish (The Bird of Truth), German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Scandinavian and Serbian. Other works retold modern works of English children's literature, including Hugh Lofting's The Story of Doctor Dolittle. His wartime renditions from Andersen's stories covered The Emperor's New Clothes, The Ugly Duckling and The Little Mermaid. Among the writer's original contributions was a series of novels for the youth. According to literary critic Matei Călinescu, who recalled having enjoyed these works as a child, they have a \\"tearjerker\\" and \\"melodramatic\\" appeal. Essayist and literary historian Paul Cernat calls them \\"commercial literature\\" able to speculate public demand, and likens them to the texts of Mihail Drumeș, another successful Aromanian author (or, beyond literature, to the popular Aromanian singer Jean Moscopol). Roxana Vintilă, \\"Un Jean Moscopol al literaturii\\", in Jurnalul Național, June 17, 2009 Other stories were humorous adaptations of the fairy tale model. They include Regina din Insula Piticilor, in which Mira-Mira, Queen of the Dolls, and her devoted servant Grăurel fend off the invasion of evil wizards. Batzaria is also credited with having coined popular children's rhymes, such as: Batzaria's Haplea was a major contribution to Romanian comics culture and interwar Romanian humor, and is ranked by comics historiographer Dodo Niță as the top Romanian series of all times. The comics, the books and the animated film all ridicule the boorish manners of peasants, and add comic effect to the clash of cultures between city and village lives. The scripts were not entirely original creations: according to translator and critic Adrian Solomon, one Haplea episode retold a grotesque theme with some tradition in the Romanian folklore (the story of Păcală), that in which the protagonist murders people for no apparent reason.Adrian Solomon, \\"The Truth About Romania's Children\\", in Plural Magazine, Nr. 30/2007 Another influence on Haplea, as noted by Batzaria reviewers, was the 19th-century fabulist and shorty author Anton Pann. Memoirs and essays A large segment of Batzaria's literary productions was constituted by subjective recollections. Kemal H. Karpat, according to whom such writings displayed the attributes of \\"a great storyteller\\" influenced by both Romanian classic Ion Creangă and the Ottoman meddahs, notes that they often fail to comply with orthodox attested timelines and accuracy checks.Karpat, pp. 565, 569 Reviewing În închisorile turcești, journalist D. I. Cucu recognized Batzaria as an entertaining raconteur, but noted that the text failed to constitute a larger fresco of the Aromanian \\"denationalization\\". Cucu described the account as entirely opposed to the romanticized narratives of Ottoman affairs, by Pierre Loti or Edmondo De Amicis. More such criticism came from Batzaria's modernist contemporary Felix Aderca, who suggested that Batzaria and Iorga (himself an occasional writer) had \\"compromised for good\\" the notion of travel literature. Felix Aderca, \\"O zi la Brașov. Note de drum'\\", in Contimporanul, Nr. 43/1923, p. 3 The main book in this series is Din lumea Islamului. Turcia Junilor Turci (\\"From the World of Islam. The Turkey of the Young Turks\\"), which traces Batzaria's own life in Macedonia and Istanbul. Its original preface was a contribution of Iorga, who recommended it for unveiling \\"that interesting act in the drama of Ottoman decline that was the first phase of Ottoman nationalism\\". In Karpat's opinion, these texts bring together the advocacy of liberalism, modernization and Westernization, flavored with \\"a special understanding of the Balkan and Turkish societies\\". Batzaria's books also describe Christianity as innately superior to Islam, better suited for modernization and education, over Islamic fatalism and superstition.Karpat, p. 584 His extended essay on women's rights and Islamic feminism, Karpat argues, shows that the Young Turks' modernizing program anticipated the Kemalist ideology of the 1920s. Overall, Batzaria gave voice to an anticlerical agenda targeting the more conservative ulema, but also the more ignorant of Christian priests, and discussed the impact of religious change, noting that the Young Turks eventually chose a secular identity over obeying their Caliphate.Karpat, pp. 578, 584 În închisorile turcești and other such writings record the complications of competing nationalisms in Ottoman lands. Batzaria mentions the Albanian landowners' enduring reverence for the Ottoman Dynasty, and the widespread adoption of the vague term \\"Turk\\" as self-designation in the Balkan Muslim enclaves.Karpat, pp. 568, 573–576 Likewise, he speaks about the revolutionary impact of ethnic nationalism inside the Christian millet, writing: \\"it was not rare to see in Macedonia a father who would call himself a Greek without actually being one [...], while one of his sons would become a fanatical Bulgarian, and the other son would turn into a killer of Bulgarians.\\"Karpat, p. 572 While theorizing an Aromanian exception among the \\"Christian peoples\\" of the Ottoman-ruled Balkans, in that Aromanians generally worked to postpone the evident Ottoman decline, Batzaria also argued that the other ethnic groups were innately hostile to the Young Turks' liberalism. However, Karpat writes, \\"Batzaria believed, paradoxically, that if the Young Turks had remained genuinely faithful to their original liberal ideals they might have succeeded in holding the state together.\\" According to Batzaria, the descent into civil war and the misapplication of liberal promises after the Young Turk Revolution made the Young Turk executive fall back on its own ethnic nationalism, and then on Turkification. That policy, the author suggested, was ineffective: regular Turks were poor and discouraged, and Europe looked with displeasure on the implicit anti-colonialism of such theories.Karpat, pp. 578–580 In Din lumea Islamului, Batzaria looks to the individuals who pushed for this policy. He traces psychological sketches of İsmail Enver (who, although supportive of a \\"bankrupt\\" Pan-Turkic agenda, displayed \\"an insane courage and an ambition that kept growing and solidifying with every step\\"), Ahmed Djemal (an uncultured chauvinist), Mehmed Talat (\\"the most sympathetic and influential\\" of the Young Turk leaders, \\"never bitten by the snake of vanity\\"). Batzaria also noted that Turkification alienated the Aromanians, who were thus divided and forced to cooperate with larger ethnic groups within their millet just before the First Balkan War, and that cooperation between them and the Bulgarians was already unfeasible before the Second War.Karpat, p. 580 According to Betzaria's anecdotal account, he and the Ottoman Armenian politician Gabriel Noradunkyan rescued Istanbul from a Bulgarian siege, by spreading false rumors about a cholera epidemic in the city. His explanation of World War I depicts the Central Powers alliance as a gamble by the most daring of the Young Turks.Karpat, pp. 581–584 Deploring the repeated acts of violence perpetrated by the Ottomans against members of the Armenian community (Noradunkyan included), Batzaria also maintains that the Armenian Genocide was primarily perpetrated by rogue Ottoman Army units, Hamidieh regiments and other Kurds.Karpat, pp. 583–584 He claims to have unsuccessfully asked the Ottoman Senate to provide Armenians with weaponry against the \\"bandits carrying a firman\\". In other works, Batzaria expanded his range, covering the various problems of modernity and cultural identity. România văzută de departe, described by D. I. Cucu as a \\"balm\\" for patriotic feeling, illustrated with specific examples the hopes and aspirations of philo- Romanians abroad: a Romanian-Bulgarian priest, a Timok Romanian mayor, an Aromanian schoolteacher, etc. The 1942 series of essays offered some of Batzaria's final comments on the issue of Aromanian politics. Although he offered implicit recognition to the existence of an \\"Aromanian dialect\\", Batzaria noted that Romanian had always been seen by him and his colleagues as the natural expression of Aromanian culture. On the occasion, he referred to \\"the Romanian minorities\\" of the Balkans as \\"the most wronged and persecuted\\" Balkan communities.Zbuchea (1999), p. 219 Legacy The work of Nicolae Constantin Batzaria was the subject of critical reevaluation during the last decades of the communist regime, when Romania was ruled by Nicolae Ceaușescu. Writing at the time, Kemal H. Karpat argued: \\"Lately there seems to be a revived interest in [Batzaria's] children's stories.\\" During the period, Romania's literary scene included several authors whose talents had been first noticed by Batzaria when, as children, they sent him their debut works. Such figures include Ștefan Cazimir, Barbu Cioculescu Barbu Cioculescu, \\"Și fiii de profesori\\", in Litere, Nr. 10–11/2011, p. 8 and Mioara Cremene. Avram Croitoru, Mioara Cremene, \\" 'N-am scris totdeauna ce am crezut, dar niciodată ce n-am crezut' \\", in Realitatea Evreiască, Nr. 242–243 (1042–1043), December 2005, p. 6 Batzaria's various works for junior readers were published in several editions beginning in the late 1960s, and included reprints of Povești de aur with illustrations by Lívia Rusz. György Györfi-Deák, \\"Cu ochii copiilor, pentru bucuria lor\\", in Caiete Silvane, June 2009 Writing the preface to one such reprint, Gica Iuteș defined Batzaria as \\"one of the eminent Aromanian scholars\\" and \\"a master of the clever word\\", while simply noting that he had \\"died in Bucharest in the year 1952.\\"Iuteș, in Batzaria (1987), pp. 3–4 Similarly, the 1979 Dicționarul cronologic al literaturii române (\\"Chronological Dictionary of Romanian Literature\\") discussed Batzaria, but gave no clue as to his death. In tandem with this official recovery, Batzaria's work became an inspiration for the dissident poet Mircea Dinescu, the author of a clandestinely circulated satire which compared Ceaușescu to Haplea and referred to both as figures of destruction. Daniel Cristea-Enache, \\"Elegii de când era mai tânăr (II)\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 19/2006 Ioan Holban, \\"Poezia Anei Blandiana\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, July 2005 Renewed interest in Batzaria's work followed the 1989 Revolution, which signified the communist regime's end. His work was integrated into new reviews produced by literary historians, and awarded a sizable entry in the 2004 Dicționar General al Literaturii Române (\\"The General Dictionary of Romanian Literature\\"). The character of this inclusion produced some controversy: taking Batzaria's entry as a study case, critics argued that the book gave too much exposure to marginal authors, at the detriment of writers from the Optzeciști generation (whose respective articles were comparatively shorter). Gabriela Adameșteanu, \\"Un monument friabil (II)\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 789, April 2005 Marius Chivu, \\"DGLR față cu receptarea critică\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 41/2005 The period saw a number of reprints from his work, including the Haplea comics and a 2003 reissue of his Haplea la București (\\"Haplea in Bucharest\\"), nominated for an annual prize in children's fiction. \\"Nominalizările pentru Premiile A.E.R\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 169, May 2003 Fragments of his writings, alongside those of George Murnu, Hristu Candroveanu and Teohar Mihadaș, were included in the Romanian Academy's standard textbook for learning Aromanian (Manual de aromână-Carti trâ învițari armâneaști, edited by Matilda Caragiu- Marioțeanu and printed in 2006). Andrei Milca, \\"Studii de morfologie și un... manual de aromână\\" , in Cronica Română, March 10, 2006 Batzaria was survived by a daughter, Rodica, who died ca. 1968. She had spent much of her life abroad, and was for a while married to painter Nicolae Dărăscu. Batzaria's great-granddaughter, Dana Schöbel-Roman, was a graphic artist and illustrator, who worked with children's author Grete Tartler on the magazine Ali Baba (printed in 1990).

Instead, Antena M continued carrying Western foreign service programmes such as Radio Free Europe, Voice of America, BBC, etc. contrary to Yugoslav army requests.

She was a member of the Přemyslid dynasty. She was Princess of Masovia by her marriage to Boleslaus II of Masovia and later became abbess of the St. George's Convent at Prague Castle. Family Kunigunde was the second of four children born to her father from his second marriage. Ottokar had been married to Margaret, Duchess of Austria, but had had no children from this marriage. Life Kunigunde was first betrothed to Hartmann of Germany in 1277,(DE)1308: Eine Topographie historischer Gleichzeitigkeit, ed. Andreas Speer, David Wirmer, (Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co., 2010), 775. a son of Rudolf I of Germany and his first wife Gertrude of Hohenberg. The marriage was intended to create peace between Germany and Bohemia. However, the engagement ended within a year. Despite this, Kunigunde's brother, Wenceslaus married Hertmann's sister, Judith of Habsburg in 1285. Kunigunde's sister Agnes followed suit and married Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, brother of Hartmann. With no other proposals of marriage, Kunigunde took the veil at the Order of Poor Ladies in Prague, where she remained for a couple of years until her brother King Wenceslaus ordered her to marry Boleslaus II of Masovia.Alfred Thomas, Reading Women in Late Medieval Europe: Anne of Bohemia and Chaucer’s Female Audience, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), 32. Marriage Upon the death of Leszek II the Black in Poland, Wenceslaus had claimed the throne. Although, this was a controversial move and caused civil war. A substantial amount of Polish nobles and citizens wished for Władysław I the Elbow-high to become King of Poland. Wenceslaus needed help to keep Poland so he decided to marry Kunigunde off to Boleslaus which would create a firm alliance with a powerful Polish noble. Kunigunde married Boleslaus in 1291 as his second wife; his first wife Sophia of Lithuania had died in 1288. From this first marriage, Boleslaus had had three children: Bolesław, Siemowit II and Anna. The marriage had left Wenceslaus in a more comfortable position. During Władysław's siege on Sieradz, Wenceslaus and Boleslaus fought together against him. Boleslaw and Kunigunde had two children: # Wenceslaus of Płock (ca. 1293 - 1336), became Duke of Plock # Euphrosyne (b. ca. 1292 - d. 26 December 1328/29), married Władysław of Oświęcim and had issue Despite being brothers-in-law, the alliance between Wenceslaus and Boleslaw did not last. Boleslaw's brother Konrad had died without surviving children, he left some of his lands to his younger brother but the rest went to King Wenceslaus, much to Boleslaw's chagrin. In retaliation, Boleslaw withdrew his support for Wenceslaus' rule in Poland and sent Kunigunde back to Prague. The couple were divorced in 1302. Later life Kunigunde as a nun When Kunigunde returned to Prague she returned to her religious life. She joined the Monastery of St. George, later becoming abbess. During this period, Kunigunde commissioned a luxurious illuminated manuscript, which is known today as the Passional of Abbess Kunigunde. Wencelaus had died in 1305 and his own son, Wenceslaus III of Bohemia became King of Bohemia and Poland. Wenceslaus II had married Elizabeth Richeza of Poland after the death of Judith of Habsburg, to create an alliance with some Polish nobles, remedying the loss of Boleslaw's support. Whilst on campaign in Poland, the sixteen-year-old Wenceslaus III was assassinated. Władysław I the Elbow-high became King of Poland (crowned in 1320). Kunigunde fostered her niece, the orphaned Elizabeth of Bohemia, who went to live with her in the Monastery of St. George. Kunigunde acted as a big influence in Elisabeth's life, though the princess moved out of the Monastery to live with her elder sister, Anna, Elisabeth Richeza and Wenceslaus III's widow Viola Elisabeth of Cieszyn. On 20 April 1313, Boleslaw died and divided his estate amongst his three sons. Kunigunde's son, Wenceslaus received the County of Płock. Elisabeth of Bohemia went on to marry John of Luxembourg and became Queen of Bohemia. Kunigunde died on 27 November 1321 at the age of fifty-six, she was outlived by her two children. Despite her complications with Poland during her lifetime, Kunigunde's great-granddaughter Jadwiga went onto marry Casimir III of Poland.

It had its world premier at the Dawn Breakers International Film Festival in Zurich. Background This documentary was made to promote discussion and interest in school reform. Tom Hurvis has been a long-time sponsor of scholarships and internships for inner city youth. The current strengths of Providence St. Mel, its curriculum, its success, and its discipline, are seen as anomalies when compared to typical inner city schools. In a neighborhood plagued by gangs drugs, and high-crime the school emerged as premiere preparatory school - one that sent 100 percent of its students to college for 30 consecutive years. with half of the graduates passing first-tier, and even Ivy League schools. When Hurvis discovered Providence St. Mel, he was inspired to create the documentary.  Synopsis  The Providence Effect is a film about Paul Adams III and the inner city Chicago school he founded and brought to prominence. Formerly a private Catholic school scheduled to be closed, Providence St. Mel has become a private school with rigorous educational standards and expectations. The film documents how the school sets and encourages those goals for students.theprovidenceeffect.comhttp://www.psm.k12.il.us/about_us.shtml The school's achievements, including how they were achieved, were outlined and supported by a series of testimonials from educators, community figures, and national leaders. The documentary also depicted how its school president, Paul Adams III, was able to introduce a model that gave both poor and wealthy students the same opportunities. The idea was that inner-city black and Hispanic children can compete with anyone on an intellectual level given access to equal academic opportunities. With this view, Adams transformed the school from an institution facing closure by the Archdiocese of Chicago to a private school through an aggressive fundraising campaign.

He was a lieutenant in the British Army, received a medal for gallantry from Queen Isabella II of Spain, was a hunter and explorer and published papers and books about his travels to Africa, Canada, Mexico and the United States. He observed the westward expansion of the United States in the 1840s during the period when the country's government was pursuing its policy of manifest destiny. He was the first author to write \\"extensively\\" of the mountain men of the Rocky Mountains. Early life George Frederick Augustus Ruxton, or George Augustus Frederick Ruxton, was born to Anna Maria Hay Ruxton and John Ruxton, Esquire near Oxfordshire, England. His maternal grandfather was Colonel Patrick Hay, a descendant of the house of Tweeddales. Ruxton attended Turnbridge School and began his education at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, but left before receiving his commission. He had an adventuresome spirit: \\"I was a vagabond in all my propensities. Everything quiet or commonplace I detested and my spirit chafed within me to see the world and participate in scenes of novelty and danger.\\" Spain He was a soldier during a Spanish Civil War, 1833–39 at the age of 17. He became a lancer under Diego de León and received the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand from Queen Isabella II for his gallantry at Belascoáin. North America He then served in the 89th (The Princess Victoria's) Regiment of Foot in Canada. Intrigued by the lives of Native Americans and trappers on the open prairie, Ruxton sold his lieutenant commission in the British Army and became a hunter in Upper Canada. Africa After returning to England, Ruxton set sail from Liverpool to explore central Africa. He was unsuccessful in obtaining the information and resources needed to explore as he wished and returned to England, but over the years yearned to return to Africa once more. He wrote a paper of African bushmen, who have been driven since Dutch occupation in 1652 \\"from desert to desert, 'their hand raised against every man, and every man's against them.'\\" On 26 November 1845, he presented his paper to the Ethnological Society of London. Mexico and the American Far West In 1846 Ruxton set sail for Veracruz, Mexico to observe the Mexican–American War. From there, he traveled north to Santa Fe, presently in the state of New Mexico. Ruxton visited Bent's Fort during as he traveled to the current state of Colorado., From January through May, 1847 (Ruxton, 1848) hunted along the front range of Colorado, visited with mountain men and endured an extremely cold winter while mostly in the company of his horse Panchito and two mules that he had acquired earlier in Mexico. Sites he visited include Ute Pass, \\"Woodland Park, Florissant, [and] Lake George\\". He spent time observing the relationships between the U.S. Army and the Comanche Indians. After working as a mountain man in the Rocky Mountains, about which he wrote the book Ruxton of the Rockies, he then moved to St. Louis. He wrote articles named Life in the Far West for Blackwood's Magazine, using the pen name \\"La Bonté\\". In it, he wrote \\"extensively\\" of the healing benefits of the mineral waters found in the west, such as Manitou Springs mineral water. He wrote of his experiences in the Far West: > I must confess that the very happiest moments of my life have been spent in > the wilderness of the Far West; and I never recall, but with pleasure, the > remembrance of my solitary camp in the Bayou Salade [Salt valley of South > Park, Colorado], with no friend near me more faithful than my rifle, and no > companions more sociable than my good horse and mules, or the attendant > cayute which nightly serenaded us. With a plentiful supply of dry pine-logs > on the fire, and its cheerful blaze streaming far up into the sky, > illuminating the valley far and near, and, pipe in mouth, watch the blue > smoke as it curled upwards, building castles in the vapoury wreaths, and, in > the fantastic shapes it assumed, peopling the solitude with figures of those > far away ... I believe not one instance could be adduced of even the most > polished and civilised of men, who had once tasted the sweets of its > attendant liberty, and freedom from every worldly care, not regretting the > moment when he exchanged it for the monotonous life of the settlements, nor > sighing and sighing again once more to partake of its pleasures and > allurements. He died at the age of 27 of epidemic dysentery in St. Louis, Missouri in 1848. Prior to that he had been bedridden from a fall that occurred in the Rocky Mountains.

The expedition was led by Theodor von Heuglin and started on 4 March 1861 in Alexandria. After sailing over the Red Sea they landed at Massawa on 17 June 1861 and observed birds on Dahlak Archipelago. Their way through the Ethiopian Highlands led them to Keren in the country of the Bilen people, from where Werner Munzinger came to join them, and afterwards to Adwa, where they met Wilhelm Schimper. Here the expedition split into two parties. Steudner remained at Heuglin. They made a wide detour through the Galla country in order to search for Tewodros II of Ethiopia. After visiting Gondar and Magdala they came to Edschebet, where they were guests of Tewodros. From Lake Tana they turned north. By way of the Blue Nile, they reached Khartoum in July 1862.Hermann Steudner. Travel reports in Zeitschrift der Berliner Gesellschaft für Erdkunde und Zeitschrift für allgemeine Erdkunde 1861-1864.

The program ended on March 31, 2011. By January 2011, the program had surpassed its original targets and had permanently retired over 120,000 vehicles and reduced thousands of tonnes of smog forming emissions. The program was available in provinces across Canada. Some automakers had started their own complimentary auto retirement programs with rewards on top of the federal program's rewards in an effort to increase vehicle sales in Canada.  Overview  On June 4, 2008 the Government of Canada announced the \\"National Vehicle Scrappage Program\\", which would create incentives for residents of Canada to trade in their old, higher-polluting vehicles to promote cleaner alternatives resulting in cleaner air and a healthier environment. The program started in February 2009 with a new name, \\"Retire Your Ride\\". It was initiated by the Government of Canada, the Clean Air Foundation, and its partners with the goal to get people's high-polluting vehicles off the road, rewarding the people for doing so. The vehicles that are traded are recycled in an environment-friendly way. The program aims to retire at least 50,000 vehicles per year until March 31, 2011. Vehicles that were made in 1995 and older that are in running condition and have been registered and properly insured for the last six months are eligible for the program. Rewards for bringing those vehicles in include a public transit pass or a membership to a car-sharing program, $300 cash, or discounts on commuter bicycles. Some automotive companies (In January 2011: GM, Ford, Hyundai and Chrysler) offer an additional rebate off the purchase of a new vehicle. Some provinces offer different rewards, such as a charitable tax receipt. The program aims for vehicles built before 1995 because they produce roughly 19 times more air pollutants than newer cars and trucks. The program is set to run for four years, with $92 million set aside for the program.  Success  During the program's launched January to mid-August 2009, the program scrapped about 12,000 vehicles, much less than the program was hoping to achieve during those months. Ford of Canada CEO Dave Mondragon said the Canadian program was \\"not having [that much] of an impact\\" and the Canadian Automotive Dealers Association suggested in April that an incentive of $3,000 would work much better. Environment Minister Jim Prentice stated that he is looking to see if offering Canadian consumers more generous incentives will result in more participants. On September 3, 2009, Prentice said that $62 million remains of the $92 million set aside for the program. As the program developed and more reward partners joined, the number of participants increased. As of October 13, 2010, Retire Your Ride had retired over 101,000 vehicles, achieving the second year's goal six months early. Retire Your Ride ended March 31, 2011.http://www.retireyourride.ca/home.aspx 350 auto recyclers have been trained and audited in a National Code of Practice that prescribes environmental best practices for the auto recycling industry - including the removal of hazardous materials (mercury switches, batteries, etc.), dismantling of the engine, reselling of parts (not related to the engine) and how to contain environmental spills. This has expanded the capacity of the auto recycling industry's environmental practices. The Code continues on with auto recyclers as the Canadian Auto Recyclers Environmental Code (CAREC).  Increase cash incentive  Dealers and manufacturers have asked the Canadian government give consumers $3,500 towards the purchase of a new car if they bring in their old vehicle, though the government stated in June 2009 that there are no plans to expand the program. Such an increase would require the government to spend $350 million on the program. If the government does increase the cash incentive, then the government could roll in the $92 million set aside for the program and would receive millions in GST on the sales of new vehicles. Richard Gauthier, president of the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association, stated in June 2009 that \\"the 3,500 new car dealers who are at the heart of nearly every community across Canada are struggling to survive this unprecedented economic downturn\\" and that increasing the cash incentive \\"could increase sales by as much as 100,000 units\\". However, on September 3, 2009, Jim Prentice announced that the federal government does not have any plans on increasing the incentives. Prentice also said the scrappage program was not intended to boost the struggling automotive industry during the current recession, but instead it was meant to get old, polluting vehicles off the road and help reduce vehicle emissions.  Automaker response  Some automakers say that the federal government is not doing enough with the scrappage program and contrasted it with the American Car Allowance Rebate System, where people who bring in a vehicle less than 25 years old may receive US$3,500 to US$4,500 towards a new vehicle. For example, the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, says a stronger scrappage program would have provide a better boost to the economy while taking polluting vehicles off the road. As a result, some automakers have created their own programs on top of the federal scrappage program that increase cash incentives in hopes of increasing vehicle sales. On August 20, 2009 Hyundai Canada started their own program complementing Retire Your Ride. In addition to the $300 already being offered by the government, Hyundai's program offers people an extra $500 to $1,000 on a new Hyundai if they bring in a vehicle to a Hyundai dealership that was made in 1995 or older. On that day Hyundai Canada president Steve Kelleher recommended the federal government increase its incentives if it has the money, though Kelleher stressed that Hyundai Canada's program is not meant to force the government to increase cash incentives. On August 21, 2009 Chrysler Canada started a program similar to Hyundai's program. In addition to the $300 being offered by the government, people who bring a vehicle made in 1995 or older that is in running condition and has been registered and insured in Canada for the previous consecutive six or 12 months to a Chrysler dealership, then they could receive an extra $500 to $1,500 towards a new Chrysler vehicle. On September 3, 2009 Ford started its own program. In addition to the $300 being offered by the government, people who bring a vehicle made in 1995 or older that has been properly registered and insured for the last six months (12 months in British Columbia) to a Ford dealership could receive an extra $1,000 towards a new Ford or Lincoln car or compact truck, $2,000 towards a new Ford sport-utility-vehicle, or $3,000 towards a new Ford truck or Lincoln vehicle. On September 16, 2009 GM started its own scrappage program. In addition to the $300 being offered by the government, people may receive, depending on the purchase price, $500, $1,000, $2,000, or $3,000 towards 2009 or 2010 model GM if they bring a vehicle made in 1995 or older that is in running condition, registered, and properly insured for the last six months (12 months in British Columbia) to a GM dealership. Retire Your Ride continues today, operated on a voluntary basis by the Automotive Recyclers of Canada (ARC), one of the original programs key stakeholders. The Program pays cash/cheque for older vehicles that are bid on by auto recyclers accredited to the CAREC standard.

Further expansion, including a sixth form, was initially due for completion by 2010. Although the school began AS Level courses in September 2009, the date for the new buildings was reviewed. Phase 2 of the school building programme started 2011. In 2016 the sister school Hampton Gardens was built along with a 3G Astro turf football field. The Hampton Academies Trust was also formed, being led by Hampton College’s former Headmistress, Helen Price, in an attempt to unify the education and community of Hampton. Hampton College and Hampton Gardens operate under a joint Sixth Form community with students learning in both schools. Hampton Gardens focuses on performing arts and dance classes whilst Hampton College retains its focus on Humanities. A third school, Hampton Lakes, is planned to be built in 2021 to complete the Hampton Academies Trust. The school currently boasts an outdoor amphitheatre and is built around a courtyard setting. In the evenings, the school is used for a variety of groups and adult education classes and it is hoped that the school will eventually form the heart of the community within Hampton. The college was found to be 'outstanding' by Ofsted in 2007, and was rated as 'outstanding' in 6 out of a possible 7 categories, putting it in the top 2% of schools nationally. A further Ofsted inspection in July 2010 again judged the school to be 'outstanding', however, since 2017, Ofsted have lowered the school’s rating to ‘good’.Hampton College's outstanding status reaffirmed by Ofsted (Accessed: 19 July 2013) Primary school provision In 2010, Peterborough City Council approached the college to run a new primary school in Hampton, as it was the Council’s preference for the operation of the primary school to come under the control of Hampton College. At the time the college was facing a change in headteacher and there were uncertainties over the phase 2 extension. Both of these issues were resolved and in April 2012(?) Hampton College governing body agreed to take on the running of the primary school from 2013; the Council formally announced the expansion in July 2012.Hampton College Primary Education provision: public notice dated 5 July 2012 (accessed: 19 July 2013) The new primary school will be built on the community playing field land (due to transfer to the city council) adjacent to the site of Hampton College which is leased by the city council. Playing fields will be retained and enhanced with changing rooms, storage and other sports and library facilities. Planning permission was granted for the development by the planning committee on 22 November 2011. The school opened its primary provision in September 2012 at nearby Hampton Hargate Primary School. The primary phase relocated to the new Hampton College school buildings in September 2013.

Rationale  Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) has become an important sub-discipline of astronomy with the proliferation of large aperture, high-resolution telescopes where there is a need to study the spectra of extended objects as a function of position, or of clusters of many discrete stars or point sources in a small field. Such spectroscopic investigations have previously been carried out with long-slit spectrographs in which the spectrum is dispersed perpendicular to the slit, and spatial resolution is obtained in the dimension along the slit. Then by stepping the position of the slit, the spectrum of points in the imaged field can be obtained, but the process is comparatively slow, and wasteful of potentially restricted telescope time. Integral field spectrographs are used to speed up such observations by simultaneously obtaining spectra in a two-dimensional field. As the spatial resolution of telescopes in space (and also of ground- based instruments using adaptive optics) has rapidly improved in recent years, the need for such multiplexed instruments has become more and more pressing.  Methods  Animation showing the galaxy NGC 7421 with MUSE data. The animation shows subsequent slices of the nitrogen line, emitted by star- forming regions. The animation begins with an image at a more blue wavelength and continues with a more red wavelength. Due to the rotation of the galaxy the emission lines are less redshifted on the left side.  Image slicer  In this approach, an image is sliced (using for example a Bowen image slicer) in the image-plane and re-arranged such that different parts of the image all fall onto a slit and a dispersing element, such that a spectrum is obtained for a larger area of interest. Another way to think of this is that the slit is optically cut into smaller pieces and re-imaged onto the image-plane at multiple locations. An instrument using this technique is for example UVES at the Very Large Telescope.  Lenslet array  In this type of IFU, a lenslet array is placed in the spectrograph entrance slits plane, essentially acting as spatial pixels or spaxels. All beams generated by the lenslet array are then fed through a dispersive element and imaged by a camera, resulting in a spectrum for each individual lenslet. Instruments like SAURON on the William Herschel Telescope and the SPHERE IFS subsystem on the VLT use this technique.  Fibers  Here, the light of targets of interest is captured by an array of fibers, forming the spectrographs entrance slits plane. The other end of the fibers are arranged along a single slit such that one obtains a spectrum for each fiber. This technique is used by instruments in many telescopes (such as INTEGRAL at the William Herschel Telescope), and particularly in currently ongoing large surveys of galaxies, such as CALIFA at the Calar Alto Observatory, SAMI at the Australian Astronomical Observatory, and MaNGA which is one of the surveys making up the next phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  Diverse field spectroscopy  A recent development is diverse field spectroscopy which combines the benefit of IFS with multi-object spectroscopy (MOS). MOS is used to collect light from many discrete objects over a wide field. This does not record spatial information – just the spectrum of the total light collected within each sampling aperture (usually the core of a positionable optical fibre or a slitlet cut in a mask at the telescope focus). In contrast, IFS obtains complete, spatially resolved coverage over a small field. The MOS targets are generally faint objects at the limits of detection such as primeval galaxies. As telescopes get bigger it is apparent that these actually have a blobby and confused structure that requires the observer to carefully select which parts of the field will be passed through to the spectrographs since it is not feasible to carpet the whole field with a single huge IFU. DFS is an instrument paradigm that allows the observer to select arbitrary combinations of contiguous and isolated regions of the sky to maximise observing efficiency and scientific return. Various technologies are under development including robotic switch-yards and photonic optical switches.  Other approaches  Other techniques can achieve the same ends at different wavelengths. The ACIS Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer on NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory is an example that obtains spectral information by direct measurement of the energy of each photon. This approach is much harder at longer wavelengths because the photons are less energetic. However progress has been made even at optical and near-infrared wavelengths using pixellated detectors such as superconducting tunnel junctions. At radio wavelengths, simultaneous spectral information is obtainable with heterodyne receivers.  Hyperspectral imaging  More generally, integral field spectroscopy is a subset of 3D-imaging techniques (also known as hyperspectral imaging and 3D spectroscopy). Other techniques rely on generation of a path difference between interfering beams using electro-mechanical scanning techniques. Examples include Fourier transform spectroscopy employing a Michelson interferometer layout and Fabry–Pérot interferometry. Although, to a first order of approximation, all such techniques are equivalent in that they generate the same number of resolution elements in a datacube (with axes labelled by the two-spatial coordinates plus wavelength) in the same time, they are not equivalent when sources of noise are considered. For example, scanning instruments, although requiring fewer costly detector elements, are inefficient when the background is varying because, unlike IFS, the exposure of the signal and background are not made at the same time. For bio-medical science, in vivo studies also require simultaneous data collection.

Company assignments * Headquarters: After completing the organization of the regiment, and a short period for drill and discipline, the Regimental headquarters was sent to Utah Territory, remaining there until October, 1864, when it moved to Camp Union, near Sacramento, and remained there until the final muster out of the regiment as an organization, in March, 1866. * Company A: Company A went first to Fort Churchill, Nevada, then to Utah Territory, where it remained until December, 1864, when it took station at Camp Union near Sacramento. About that time the terms of service of most of its members expired. ** New Company A: Company A was reorganized by reenlistment of many of its old members and the enlistment of recruits enough to fill up the company to the required number. In September, 1865, it marched to Fort Miller, in Fresno County, and in November 1865, it marched to Camp Babbitt, near Visalia, where it remained until ordered to Camp Union, near Sacramento, for muster out, in April, 1866. * Company B: Company B was ordered to Southern California in February 1862, and became part of Carleton's California Column. It marched with that command to New Mexico. In the spring of 1864 it returned to California, and was mustered out as a company at San Francisco, October 10, 1864. The company commander during this period of service was Captain John C. Cremony. ** New Company B: After the muster out of the original Company B, a new Company B was organized, and George D. Conrad became Captain of the company. The new company remained at Camp Union, until June, 1865, when it moved to the mining town of Dun Glen, Nevada, where it served defending against Indian attacks, until mustered out in the spring of 1866. * Company C: Served at Fort Crook, nearly the whole of the time it was in the service. ** New Company C: When the enlistments of its original members expired in the fall of 1864, they were mustered out at Fort Crook, and the company was filled up by enlistment of recruits in San Francisco. It was finally mustered out at Sacramento in May, 1866. * Company D: After leaving Camp Alert, Company D went to Southern California in early 1862, the company was camped at Kline's Ranch while the rest were on detached duty supporting the organization of the California Column. In June 1862, it was sent to join Col. Evans' campaign against the Paiute in the Owens Valley but then returned to Camp Babbit in the fall. On the rusumtion of hostilities in the Owens Valley they marched back in April 1863 via Keyesville, engaged in the Keyesville Massacre then moved on to Camp Independence, in the Owens River Valley, participating in the final campaign of the Owens Valley Indian War, and escorting almost 1000 Paiute to Fort Tejon in July 1863. They remained there until August, 1863; then to Fort Tejon, until March, 1864, when it moved to Camp Union, where the original members were mustered out. ** New Company D: Upon the expiration of their enlistment terms, during the months of September and October, 1864 the company was reorganized by Captain W. L. Knight, and after serving a short time at Camp Union, and Camp Jackson, in Amador County, it went to Colusa; then to Red Bluff, and finally, in July, 1865, to Smoke Creek, Nevada (north of Pyramid Lake), where it remained until ordered in to be mustered out at Camp Union, May 29, 1866. * Company E: Originally organized as the \\"Tuolumne Rangers\\", after leaving Camp Alert, Company E, went first to Fort Humboldt, remaining there until the spring of 1862.

The album led to a production deal with Mike Curb at MGM Records, where he helped produce a cover version of \\"The Candy Man\\", which was a chart-topping hit for Sammy Davis, Jr. in 1972. He assembled the Incredible Bongo Band in 1972, which produced an album that was the soundtrack for that year's science fiction film The Thing with Two Heads, consisting of remakes of instrumental songs from the 1950s and 1960s given a characteristic funk style, and achieving a hit with \\"Bongo Rock\\", a remake of a 1959 song by Preston Epps. That success led Viner to produce Bongo Rock, another album for the group, that included \\"Apache\\", a remake of the instrumental which was originally a 1960 UK hit for The Shadows and in 1961 a US hit for guitarist Jørgen Ingmann. Decades later, hip hop artists started sampling the Incredible Bongo Band recording, with the percussion breakdown from \\"Apache\\" appearing in songs by DJ Kool Herc, L.L. Cool J and Nas, as well as Moby. Among the artists he signed at MGM Records was Debby Boone, who would have a hit in 1977 with \\"You Light Up My Life\\".

Although Viner became known for publishing sensational tabloid-style books such as You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again and Faye Resnick's book about Nicole Brown Simpson, among Dove's first successes was the audiobook of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time.

Prior to learning from Cao Jiwu, Dai Long Bang was already a master in Taijiquan. Dai Longbang further developed Xinyi and wrote the book “The Six Harmonies Fists”, which constitutes the written classics of the style.

However, Dai Long Bang himself states in his book that he did not create Xinyi Quan. The Dai brothers were in the vegetable wholesale business, and did not publicly teach to others outside their family. However, after many years of keeping the art within the family, Dai Long Bang's son Dai Wenxiong accepted Li Luoneng as a student, who went on to become a very famous martial artist, and a popularizer of the art.

It is a revamped, more lighthearted version of Gabriel's Fire, which aired on ABC the previous season. Overview Gabriel Bird is a former Chicago police officer, who, over twenty years prior, had been wrongfully sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a fellow officer. He was exonerated and subsequently became a Chicago private detective (as seen on Gabriel's Fire). Bird then moves to Los Angeles, where he teams up with another private eye, Mitch O'Hannon. Bird also marries his love interest, Josephine, She had been the proprietress of a café where Bird had begun frequenting shortly after his release, at first for her good, homestyle cooking, but soon, primarily for her companionship. The episode \\"Birds Gotta Fly\\", directed by Mario Van Peebles, starred Irene Cara as Bird's estranged daughter Celine, as well as movie and TV personality Michael Beach as Josephine's military-bound son, and Meagan Good in a small role. When the revamped version of Gabriel's Fire was announced, its original working title was Bird & Katt, as Crenna's character was first named Peter Katt in development. After further revision of the new format, Peter Katt became Mitch O'Hannon and the producers settled on the title Pros and Cons, which had a dual meaning—not only that of the positives and negatives of the two leads working together, but of the fact that they were professional detectives often chasing after convicts.

For his actions during the Battle of Baxter Springs, he received the Medal of Honor. Returning to civilian life, he became a successful lecture manager whose clients included Mark Twain, Winston Churchill, and Henry Morton Stanley. Early life Pond was born on June 11, 1838 in Cuba, New York, though his official residence was listed as Janesville, Wisconsin. The family moved, first to Illinois in 1844, then to Wisconsin in 1847. Pond became a strong abolitionist. He was a member of the Underground Railroad, helping escaped slaves reach freedom and reportedly riding with John Brown for a time in the mid-1850s. He studied printing and published The Journal in Markesan, Wisconsin between 1860 and 1861. Civil War In November 1861, Pond was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 3rd Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. At the Battle of Baxter Springs, he fought against the notorious Confederate guerrilla leader William Quantrill and his Raiders. For his heroism in that action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor on March 30, 1898. By the time he mustered out in September 1865, he had been promoted to the rank of major. Medal of Honor citation :For extraordinary heroism on 6 October 1863, while serving with Company C, 3d Wisconsin Cavalry, in action at Baxter Springs, Kansas. While in command of two companies of Cavalry, First Lieutenant Pond was surprised and attacked by several times his own number of guerrillas, but gallantly rallied his men, and after a severe struggle drove the enemy outside the fortifications. First Lieutenant Pond then went outside the works and, alone and unaided, fired a howitzer three times, throwing the enemy into confusion and causing him to retire. Post-war career After the war, he tried his hand at various business enterprises in the western United States. In Salt Lake City, he was asked to manage a national lecture tour for Ann Eliza Young, the 52nd wife of Brigham Young, who had become disillusioned with her husband. She eventually divorced Young and spoke out against him, the LDS Church, and polygamy. In 1874, Pond purchased the Lyceum Theatre Lecture Bureau and embarked on a career managing speakers. In 1879, he moved his main office to New York City. In addition to Mark Twain's 1884-85 tour, Pond managed the North American stage of the worldwide lecture tour the author undertook in 1895-96 to pay off his enormous debts. He also promoted Winston Churchill's first American tour, though the two had a falling out and Churchill referred to Pond as \\"a vulgar Yankee impresario.\\" Explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley earned $60,000 for an 1890-91 U.S. tour set up by Pond. Other clients included P. T. Barnum, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglass, Arthur Conan Doyle, Ellen Terry, and Henry Ward Beecher. Pond wrote a book entitled Eccentricities of Genius (1900), in which he reminisced about his experiences with his famous clients. Personal life Pond's first wife, the former Ann Frances Lynch, died in 1871. He married Martha Glass of Jersey City in 1880. Three of his brothers, George, Homer, and Philip, also fought for the Union in the Civil War. George F. Pond was awarded the Medal of Honor as well, for a later action. Pond died due primarily to an ulcer on his right foot that turned gangrenous. All seemed well after a successful amputation below the knee, but Pond took a turn for the worse and died of heart failure on June 21, 1903. He was survived by his wife, a son, and a daughter. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx, New York. His grave can be found in section 70, lawn plot, lot 6393 NW 1/4. After his death, his son James B. Pond Jr. took over the business.

However, encouraged by the previous experience with the Belgrade Strangler, Kopicl tried to live the role of the strangler, moving around Belgrade streets and eventually expanding the song lyrics. \\"Beogradski davitelj\\" became a nationwide hit and was broadcast on the popular music radio show host by Sofija Mačkić (Sonja Savić). Kopicl had a live radio interview on the show and announced the date of the first live appearance of the band. VIS Simboli had their first show on a Friday the 13th.

Band The group consists of: * Ambroise Willaume - Vocals, guitar, piano * Christophe Musset - Vocals, guitar * Jérémie Arcache - Cello, vocals * (Maxime Garoute - Drums) Beginnings Christophe Musset (vocals, guitar) and Ambroise Willaume (vocals, guitar, piano), joined by Jérémie Arcache (cello, backing vocals), composed their first songs in an apartment in Paris. Unable to make too much noise, they focused on their vocals and played mainly acoustic instruments, describing their music as \\"pop de chambre\\" due to its similarities with chamber music (\\"musique de chambre\\" in French). Performing in small venues such as bars and friends' apartments, the band was discovered and signed by the Parisian label Delabel/EMI, releasing the Pop de chambre EP in early 2008. In June 2009, they recorded their first LP Music for a While. Revolver toured France in 2009 with a few dates in Germany and Switzerland, adding percussionist Maxime Garoute and using more electric guitar in their live performances. Although they sing in English, they were nominated twice at the French Music Awards \\"Les Victoires de la Musique\\" in March 2010, for \\"Révélation album\\" (Best Debut Album) and \\"Révélation Scène\\" (Best New Live Act).  Influences  * They chose English from the beginning because, being influenced by the Beatles, Elliott Smith, Neil Young, Radiohead, Simon & Garfunkel, The Kinks... it is the language in which their writing comes most naturally. In addition, it is easier to use harmonies in English than in French in pop music. * Jérémie has hardly ever listened to pop, he says it's Mozart, especially the Magic Flute which gave him the desire to become a musician, Christopher and Ambroise make him listen to pop more often and took him to see Radiohead at Bercy in 2008 so that he would truly discover it. On the other hand Christophe admits he never listened to classical music. It was only with the group that he started listening to Bach ... * Ambroise and Christophe say it's Elliott Smith that gave them the desire to get into the music and Christophe was listening to Jean-Jacques Goldman as a child. Ambroise meanwhile, said he also loves kitsch stuff, such as Elton John, ABBA or the Bee Gees... They also meet every three to another point : for them is Radiohead the \\"greatest band in the world\\" . * Their music is a bridge between pop and classical music or even the Renaissance or the Baroque and influence everything from Beatles to Bach, from Benjamin Britten to Elliot Smith. In the group we can also say that Ambroise is the bridge between Christopher and Jérémie because he is the only one with a culture that is both classic and pop. Songs that the group have covered during their performances include: *\\"This Boy\\", \\"Because\\" and \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" by The Beatles *\\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\" by Elvis Presley *\\"Helplessly Hoping\\" by Crosby, Stills & Nash *\\"I Only Have Eyes for You\\" by The Flamingos * \\"Balulalow\\" from A Ceremony of Carols by Benjamin Britten which Jérémie and Ambroise sang in chorus to the Master of Notre Dame de Paris when they were children. * \\"Nevertheless (I'm in Love with You)\\" by The Mills Brothers * \\"Monk\\" by Mini Mansions Discography Albums * 2009 : Music for a While ** 2010 : Music for a While (re-edited with 5 bonus tracks on a second CD) * 2012 : Let Go EPs * 2008 : Pop de chambre * 2011 : Parallel Lives Singles *2009: \\"Get Around Town\\" *2010: \\"Balulalow\\" *2010: \\"Leave Me Alone\\" *2012: \\"Wind Song\\" References External links http://www.froggydelight.com/article-7001-Revolver.html [archive] *Revolver chats with the mixtape Category:French pop music groups Category:Musical groups established in 2006 Category:Astralwerks artists Category:Musical groups from Paris ","title":"Revolver (French band)"},{"id":"24046251","title":"Sin Kim-dan"},{"id":"24046258","text":"Dmitry Vyacheslavovich Korolyov (; born 15 April 1988) is a former Russian professional association football player.

Biography Villegas was born in the neighborhood of “La Experiencia” in Zapopan and as many in his town he was a textile industry worker. In his infancy he was nicknamed “Jamaicón” because he cried too much (in some regions of Mexico, “Jamaicón” is considered a polite way to call someone a whiner). He began his football career playing for “Club Imperio” in 1949 and he was selected to the Jalisco State youth league in 1951. In the second round of his selection his team went to play for the National Championship final in the state of Nuevo León. He was raised at the center of a typical Mexican family, and as most other youth in his town, he would work in textiles, and then play in his spare time. His ability to play as a defensive player allowed him to play with one of the best Mexican football club, C.D. Guadalajara, knows as “Chivas del Guadalajara”. He won 8 championships with the Chivas league, assisted in 13 World Cup play-offs and played in two World Cups. As a right defensive player he could not be passed by and faced world-renowned players to which he stopped from scoring., perhaps the most memorable being Garrincha of Botafogo. 1962 World Cup While Mexico prepared to play in the World Cup at Chile in 1962 it was said that if Villegas had defeated Garrincha time and time again, surely there was enough defensive strength in the Mexico national team for the World Cup. The Mexican Football Federation went on a tour of trial games with Ignacio Trelles at the head and their first stop was London, England. Trelles decided to line up “Piolín” Mota, a second-string goalkeeper. Mota was quite concerned with the startup but Trelles told him he had nothing to worry about as Villegas would be there to defend the goal. Mexico lost 8–0 against England. As a reporter approached him to interview him on his disappointing performance, he said he missed his mother and days had gone by where he could not eat \\"birria\\" and that life was not worth it if he was not in his town. Another interesting fact was that, even though he had defeated Garrincha in league games, he was so afraid of him during the 1962 World Cup he constantly asked where the attacker was. Jamaicon Syndrome A story also tells that one day he sneaked out of a dinner that was served to the Mexican team in Lisbon, prior to the Sweden World Cup of 1958. The trainer was made aware of this and found him in the Hotel garden, sitting under a tree hugging his legs and looking at the stars with melancholy. As he asked him if he had eaten dinner and everything was Ok, “Jamaicón” answered “How can I eat dinner if that was prepared for a bunch of presumptuous people? All I want are my “chalupas”, some “sopes” and not that trash that's not even Mexican”. Ever since, the phenomenon of Mexicans missing Mexico when they are out of the country is known as “The Jamaicón Syndrome”.

Firearms of Japan were introduced in the 13th century by the Chinese, but saw little use. Portuguese firearms were introduced in 1543, and intense development followed, with strong local manufacture during the period of conflicts of the late 16th century. Hōjutsu, the art of gunnery, is the Japanese martial art dedicated to firearms usage.  Teppo  Early Chinese hand cannon Due to its proximity with China, Japan had long been familiar with gunpowder weaponry. Firearms seem to have first appeared in Japan around 1270, as primitive metal tubes invented in China and called teppō (鉄砲 lit. \\"iron cannon\\") seem to have been introduced in Japan as well.Perrin p.93 These weapons were very basic, as they had no trigger or sights, and could not bear comparison with the more advanced European weapons which were introduced in Japan more than 250 years later. Tanegashima (matchlock) The first documented introduction of the matchlock which became known as the tanegashima was through the Portuguese in 1543. The tanegashima seems to have been based on snap matchlocks that were produced in the armory of Malacca in Portuguese Malacca, which was captured by the Portuguese in 1511. The name tanegashima came from the island where a Chinese junk with Portuguese adventurers on board was driven to anchor by a storm. The lord of the Japanese island Tanegashima Tokitaka (1528–1579) purchased two matchlock muskets from the Portuguese and put a swordsmith to work in copying the matchlock barrel and firing mechanism. Within a few years the use of the tanegashima in battle forever changed the way war was fought in Japan. From 1560, firearms were used in large battles in Japan.Perrin p.8 In his memoirs published in 1614, the Portuguese adventurer turned author Fernão Mendes Pinto placed himself in that first landing party, although this claim has been roundly discredited and in fact contradicts his claims to be simultaneously in Burma at the time. However, Pinto does appear to have visited Tanegashima soon thereafter. History  Sengoku Period  Ashigaru (foot soldiers) using matchlocks (tanegashima) from behind shields (tate). Japan was at war during the Sengoku Period between 1467 and 1600, as feudal lords vied for supremacy.Perrin p.9 Matchlock guns were used extensively and had a decisive role in warfare. In 1549, Oda Nobunaga ordered 500 matchlocks to be made for his armies. The benefits of firearms were still relatively questionable however compared to other weapons. At the time, guns were still rather primitive and cumbersome. According to one estimate in 16th century Japan, an archer could fire 15 arrows in the time a gunner would take to load, charge, and shoot a firearm.Perrin p.15 Effective range also was only 80 to 100 meters, and at that distance, a bullet could easily bounce off armour. Furthermore, matchlocks were vulnerable to humid or rainy conditions as the powder would become damp. However, firearms could be manned effectively by farmers or non-samurai low-ranking soldiers.Perrin p.25 The Japanese soon worked on various techniques to improve the effectiveness of their guns. They developed serial firing technique to create a continuous rain of bullets on the enemy.Perrin p.17 They also developed bigger calibers to increase lethal power. Protective boxes in lacquerware were invented to be able to fire matchlocks in the rain,Perrin, p.18 as well as systems to accurately fire weapons at night by keeping fixed angles thanks to measured strings.Perrin, p.40 As a result, in the year 1567, Takeda Shingen announced that \\"Hereafter, the guns will be the most important arms. Therefore, decrease the number of spears per unit, and have your most capable men carry guns\\".Perrin, p.17 At the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, 3,000 arquebusiers helped win the battle, firing by volleys of 1,000 at a time, and concealed across a river and breastwork to effectively stop enemy infantry and cavalry charges while being protected.Perrin p.19-20 In the year 1584 Ikeda Sen led a troop of 200 women armed with firearms at the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute and in 1600 at the Battle of Sekigahara, rare example of Teppō unit, or musketeer unit consisting only of women. Japan became so enthusiastic about the new weapons that it possibly overtook every European country in absolute numbers produced. Japan also used the guns in the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592, in which about a quarter of the invasion force of 160,000 were gunners.Perrin p.27 They were extremely successful at first and managed to capture Seoul just 18 days after their landing at Busan.Perrin p.28  Edo Period  The internal war in Japan was won by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who established the Tokugawa shogunate, a powerful entity that would maintain peace and prosperity in Japan for the following 250 years. From the mid-17th century, Japan decided to close itself to interaction with the West through its policy of Sakoku. Guns were used less frequently because the Edo Period did not have many large-scale conflicts in which a gun would be of use. Oftentimes the sword was simply the more practical weapon in the average small-scale Edo Period conflicts, nevertheless there were gunsmiths in Japan producing guns through the Edo Period. Isolation did not decrease the production of guns in Japan—on the contrary, there is evidence of around 200 gunsmiths in Japan by the end of the Edo Period. But the social life of firearms had changed: as the historian David L. Howell has argued, for many in Japanese society, the gun had become less a weapon than a farm implement for scaring off animals.  Late Edo Period  Japanese percussion pistol, 19th century, possibly converted from a matchlock.A few Japanese started to study and experiment with recent Western firearms from the beginning of the 19th century especially as a means to repel the visits of foreign ships, such as the incursion by British frigate HMS Phaeton in 1808.Perrin, p.72 Through the process of rangaku (the studying of Western science through the Dutch), airguns were developed by Kunitomo Ikkansai c. 1820–1830. From 1828, experiments were made with flintlock mechanisms. The Nagasaki samurai Takashima Shūhan (高島秋帆) started to import flintlock guns from the Netherlands known as \\"geweer\\" from the 1840s. He made the first modern Western military demonstration for the Tokugawa shogunate, in Tokumarugahara (north of Edo) on 27 June 1841. With the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1854 and the inescapable opening of the country to trade, rapid efforts were made at reequipping Japan with modern fireams. Old matchlock weapons were recovered and converted to flintlock mechanisms.Perrin, p.67  Boshin War  The mounting civil war in Japan and the opposition of various feudal lords against the Bakufu during the Late Tokugawa shogunate led to serious rearming until the 1867 Boshin War. At the same time, technological progress was extremely fast in the West, with the introduction of the rifle, breech-loading and even repeating firearms, so that Japanese armies were equipped with composite technologies, with weapons imported from countries as varied as France, Germany, the Netherlands, Britain and the United States, and coexisting with traditional Tanegashima guns.Totman, p.344 During the Boshin War, most shogunate vassal troops used Gewehr smoothbore guns. These guns were rather ancient and had limited capabilities, with an effective lethal range of about 50 meters, and a firing rate of about two rounds per minute. Much more effective Minié rifles were also used by the armies directly under the command of the shōgun, the Bakufu troops. The Daimyō of Nagaoka, an ally of the shōgun, possessed two Gatling guns and several thousand modern rifles. The shogunate is known to have placed an order for 30,000 modern Dreyse needle guns in 1866. In 1867, orders were placed for 40,000 state-of-the-art French Chassepot rifles, a part of which reached Edo by year's end. Antiquated Tanegashima matchlock guns are also known to have been used by the Bakufu however.Ryozen Museum of History exhibit Imperial troops mainly used Minié rifles, which were much more accurate, lethal, and had a much longer range than the smoothbore Gewehr guns, although, being also muzzle-loading, they were similarly limited to two shots per minute. Improved breech-loading mechanisms, such as the Snider, developing a rate of about ten shots a minute, are known to have been used by troops of the Tosa Domain against the shogunate's Shōgitai, at the Battle of Ueno in July 1868. In the second half of the conflict, in the northeast theater, Tosa Province troops are known to have used American-made Spencer repeating rifles. American-made handguns were also popular, such as the 1863 Smith & Wesson Army No 2, which was imported to Japan by the Scottish trader Thomas Blake Glover and used by the Satsuma forces.  Modern period  For some time after the Meiji Restoration, Japan continued to use imported weapons. The newly created Imperial Japanese Army used firearms intensively against more traditional samurai rebellious forces during the Satsuma rebellion in 1877, with an average of 320,000 rounds of ammunition fired daily during the conflict.Perrin, p.76 After the Satsuma rebellion, Japan relied extensively on the French Chassepot.Rifles of the World John Walter, p.88 Japan finally developed its own model, the Murata rifle, derived from the French Fusil Gras mle 1874. This was Japan's first locally made service rifle, and was used from 1880 to 1898. An industrial infrastructure, such as the Koishikawa arsenal had to be established to produce such new weapons. Later, Japan developed the very successful bolt action Arisaka series rifles, which was the Japanese service rifle until the end of World War II.Bolt Action Rifles Frank De Haas p.71 Japan produced relatively few submachine guns during World War II, the most numerous model was the Type 100 submachine gun of which 24,000–27,000 were produced, compared, for example, with the British Sten of which millions were produced. During the war, the Japanese worked on a copy of the American semi-automatic M1 Garand (the Type 5 rifle) but only a few hundred were made before the end of the war and it did not enter service. After the end of the war, the dissolution of the Imperial Japanese Army, and the establishment of the Japan Self-Defense Forces in 1947, Japan relied on M1 Garand rifles provided by the United States. In the mid-1950s however, Japan's Defense Agency started to develop battle rifles of its own, such as the Howa Type 64Rifles of the world by John Walter p.182 and assault rifles like the Howa Type 89 which has been gradually replacing the former.Rifles: an illustrated history of their impact by Dr. David Westwood p.369, Google Books  See also  * Artillery of Japan References Further reading * Jansen, Marius B (2000).

Located on the Isthmus of Chignecto, LaPlanche crosses the Tantramar Marshes between Amherst, NS and Sackville, NB. Historically, it hosted the key forts of peninsular Nova Scotia and continental Acadia and witnessed the Battle of Fort Beauséjour, the key battle between the two colonies during the Seven Years' War, and the Battle of Fort Cumberland of the American Revolutionary War. History Fort Beauséjour - Fort Cumberland National Historic Site of CanadaWhen originally settled by the Acadians, the Tantramar community was called Beaubassin. La Planche means \\"the plank\\" and describes a plank-bridge route over what is now also called Laplanche River. This would eventually extend into the principal route between Continental Acadia (New Brunswick) and (then) Peninsular Acadia (Nova Scotia). 1700s As the major throughway between two rival colonies, British Nova Scotia and Acadia, early LaPlanche was guarded by two forts. In 1750 Fort Lawrence (located in the present-day community called Fort Lawrence on the Missaguash River, just west of Amherst, NS) was built by British troops on LaPlanche Street to defend the border of Nova Scotia. In response, the French built Fort Beauséjour on Beauséjour ridge (now Aulac Ridge). In the Battle of Fort Beauséjour (1755), the opening mark of the French and Indian War, Fort Beauséjour fell to the British, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Monckton. Recognizing its superiority, the British burned their own Fort Lawrence and moved into Fort Beauséjour, renaming it Fort Cumberland.History: Fort Beauséjour – Fort Cumberland National Historic Site of Canada. Parks Canada, Government of Canada Acadia's Great Upheaval began in Beaubassin immediately after this battle. The southern dock of the Chignecto Ship Railway, on the Missaguash River, Fort Lawrence Two decades later, Jonathan Eddy tried to bring the American Revolutionary War to Nova Scotia with Battle of Fort Cumberland. Eddy and his militia of 400 men stormed the fort in 1776. The British successfully defended and thus ensured loyalty to the British throne for Nova Scotia during the revolution.Ernest Clarke, The siege of Fort Cumberland, 1776, McGill Queen's University Press, 1995. pp. 215- In the decades to follow Amherst, Sackville and Aulac (LaPlanche Street's midpoint) would be populated by waves of English-speaking settlers, namely the New England Planters and the Yorkshire settlers.Migration from Yorkshire to Nova Scotia 1800s Maleable Iron Works, LaPlanche Street, Amherst, Nova Scotia La Planche Street would also serve as the southern end of the Chignecto Ship Railway - had it been completed. Designed by Henry Ketchum, the ship railway would have been one of the most impressive engineering feats of its day. The railway would use two steam locomotives to transport small cargo and passenger ships between the upper Bay of Fundy and the Northumberland Strait, with the potential to reduce the 800 kilometre journey-by-sea around Nova Scotia to a mere 24 kilometres. It ran between Fort Lawrence, Nova Scotia, outside Amherst, and Tidnish on the, Northumberland Strait. In 1891, federal funding was withdrawn and the project never saw fruition.Ircha M. C., \\"The Chignecto Ship Railway: a 19th century engineering innovation.\\" Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering 19, 1 (1992): 164-177. 1900s The historic Hampton Diner. Both Sackville and Amherst would develop into industrial towns. On the western end of LaPlanche Street (now called Bridge Street, NB Route 106) was Sackville's downtown core. On the eastern end (still called LaPlanche Street, NS Route 204) was Amherst's old industrial park immediately before its downtown. The LaPlanche industrial park manufactured railway passenger and freight cars, boilers, engines, automobile parts and generator plants and was home to the Rhodes Curry Company, the Canadian Car and Foundry Co., Robb Engineering Co., Malleable Iron Co., McLean Milling Co., Oxford Worsted Co., Hewson Woolen Mills, Eastern Pants Co., M. Shane & Co., News Publishing Co., and E. Biden & Sons.The History of Amherst by J. A. Blanche. Cumberland Regional Library As more advanced industrial centres developed elsewhere, LaPlanche's industry fell into disuse. In the 1960s it was replaced by a newer, smaller industrial park on the Trans-Canada Highway. As the major throughway between mainland Canada and Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, LaPlanche hosted many tourist-oriented businesses. It sustained three diners famous in local memory: Mel's Tea Room (Sackville), Eva's Place (Aulac), and The Hampton Diner (Fort Lawrence). Nova Scotia built its Tourist Welcome Centre on LaPlanche Street in Fort Lawrence, placing it between the east and west-bound lanes. Now The 1960s saw the Trans-Canada Highway system being upgraded to four-lane expressways. This included a new route between Sackville and Amherst running roughly parallel to LaPlanche Street (Nova Scotia Highway 104-Nova Scotia Trunk 2 meeting New Brunswick Highway 2). Services inevitably became concentrated at the Aulac exit, where the PEI route branches, and LaPlanche Street's economy began to fade. Various bridges and sections of LaPlanche Street were dismantled and the street was divided into three disconnected segments. The Sackville segment (Bridge Street) remains vital, while Aulac and Amherst's host numerous dilapidated shops, plants and motels, and serve the fringe economy and culture of the two communities, masking the centuries of history for which it was stage. Geography Chignecto Isthmus An historic map of the Chignecto Isthmus. LaPlanche Street traverses the low-lying, southern edge of the Chignecto Isthmus, which connects Nova Scotia with New Brunswick and thus mainland Canada. The Isthmus runs from the Petitcodiac River in Dieppe, New Brunswick to Amherst, Nova Scotia and has as its two oceanic boundaries the Chignecto Bay, a sub-basin of the Bay of Fundy, and the Northumberland Strait, an arm of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The isthmus is made up of the Tantramar Marshes, at sea level, and four ridges that emerge from the Bay of Fundy and rise north-easterly:History of Chignecto , by W. C.

The stations opened with the first section of the L Taraval line on April 12, 1919; irregular shuttle service had run on a United Railroads line since around 1907. History Around 1907, the private United Railroads (URR) opened its Parkside Shuttle line, which split from the #17 line on 20th Avenue and ran along Taraval Street, 33rd Avenue, Vicente Street, and 35th Avenue. This trackage, which saw irregular passenger service, formed a barrier to continued expansion of the city-owned Municipal Railway into the Parkside district.

Muni's L Taraval line opened to 33rd Avenue (on rebuilt URR trackage west of 20th Avenue) on April 12, 1919. The URR discontinued their Parkside Shuttle in late 1927. Planned changes The outbound boarding island at 23rd Avenue in 2017 The L Taraval formerly had stops spaced every 2 blocks from 22nd Avenue to 32nd Avenue; trains generally stopped at marked poles before the cross street, and passengers crossed travel lanes to board. With the introduction of new LRVs in the 1990s, the stops at 22nd Avenue and 24th Avenue were modified to provide access to McCoppin Park and adjacent commercial and residential areas. A small accessible high platform and concrete boarding island were added for outbound passengers west of 23rd Avenue and for inbound passengers east of 22nd Avenue.

The station opened with the first section of the L Taraval line on April 12, 1919; irregular shuttle service had run on a United Railroads line since around 1907. Nearby 33rd Avenue was the outer terminus of the line until the extension to 48th Avenue on January 14, 1923. History Around 1907, the private United Railroads (URR) opened its Parkside Shuttle line, which split from the #17 line on 20th Avenue and ran along Taraval Street, 33rd Avenue, Vicente Street, and 35th Avenue. This trackage, which saw irregular passenger service, formed a barrier to continued expansion of the city-owned Municipal Railway into the Parkside district. On November 25, 1918, the city and the private URR signed the \\"Parkside Agreements\\", which allowed Muni streetcars to use URR trackage on Taraval Street and on Ocean Avenue in exchange for a cash payment and shared maintenance costs. Muni's L Taraval line opened to 33rd Avenue (on rebuilt URR trackage west of 20th Avenue) on April 12, 1919. Nearby 33rd Avenue, where the URR line turned to the south, was the outer terminus of the L Taraval until the extension to 48th Avenue on January 14, 1923. The URR discontinued their Parkside Shuttle in late 1927. Planned changes Like many stations on the line, Taraval and 32nd Avenue has no platforms; trains stop at marked poles before the cross street, and passengers cross travel lanes to board. In March 2014, Muni released details of the proposed implementation of their Transit Effectiveness Project (later rebranded MuniForward), which included a variety of stop changes for the L Taraval line. The stops at 32nd Avenue would be moved to the far side of the cross street as boarding islands, with a traffic signal with transit signal priority replacing the existing stop signs to prevent trains from stopping twice. On September 20, 2016, the SFMTA Board approved the L Taraval Rapid Project. Construction will occur from 2018 to 2020. Boarding islands are planned to be built at 32nd Avenue; contrary to the original plan, the stops will remain on the near side of the cross street. Early implementation of some project elements, including painted clear zones where the outbound boarding island will be located, was done in early 2017. In response to merchants complaining about the loss of parking spaces to allow for boarding islands, the Board agreed to an experimental pilot program on the inbound side at five stops: 26th, 30th, 32nd, 35th, and 40th Avenues. Painted stripes and signage were added to indicate that vehicles should stop behind trains to allow passengers to board and alight safely.

Opinionated reviews and ratings of video game hardware or titles are generally avoided. The show is not released on a regular schedule, with new episodes being released, on average, once every 1.5 months. The host, Jason Cirillo, is an independent designer for Robotube Games, and appears in each episode. The setting of the show is usually said to be \\"the offices of Robotube Games\\" with each show opening in front of a flatscreen television displaying the Bit Museum logo. Earlier episodes opened with a tinny-sounding 8-bit filtered rendition of pianist George Shearing's I'm Getting Sentimental Over You, hastily created in order to launch the show quickly, but starting from episode 4 a new vocalized theme song has been used.Zack Weisinger's theme song on YouTube The song, composed by guitarist Zack Weisinger, features 8-bit sounding electronic music featuring the simplistic lyrics: > We are learning so much about all this cool stuff, I cannot wait for the > show. History The show's first episode features a detailed history of video game hardware made by Nintendo in the 1970s, and released only in Japan. The consoles \\"Racing 112\\" and \\"Block Kuzushi\\" are both displayed and demonstrated, with a Nintendo Famicom and Famicom Disk System shown, but not demonstrated. The show opens immediately with an outtake which was intentionally left into the final edit. As Cirillo introduces the show, someone in an office chair rolls by in the background at a high speed, prompting laughter and a camera cut. The show's tone is comedic with the occasional insertion of visual gags, juvenile humor, and frequent camera jump cuts. On occasion, characters make appearances in the show to add humor, such as a shouting, fake-bearded Billy Mays parody in Bit Museum #3: The Wizard of Odyssey, and the \\"Official Bit Museum Handler\\" who was \\"summoned\\" to bring out the show's subject matter in Bit Museum #4: The Smoke and Mirrors of Entex Adventure Vision. These characters are both portrayed by Ed Wilson. Bit Museum usually features 2-3 pieces of antiquated video game hardware per episode. Detailed inspection of features, physical build, game play, history and facts about inventors, historical sales numbers, and production notes are staples of each episode. Certain pieces of hardware featured on Bit Museum are considered to be extremely rare amongst game collectors, such as the Entex Adventure Vision, which is featured in Episode #4.Entex Adventurevision information page Popularity Bit Museum is regularly featured on Destructoid.comDestructoid.com: Jason Cirillo knows more about retro gaming than you do (episode 1) upon release, with syndication to VimeoBit Museum on Vimeo and YouTube.Bit Museum on YouTube The show has also appeared on various video game related blogs.

It was first devised by Mr. John Trelde and Mr. Gert Lenk, both of Copenhagen, Denmark. While it is rarely used in North America (where Michaels cuebids are most popular), it is fairly popular in Europe, especially Denmark. The requirement for a bid in the Copenhagen convention is a two-suited hand with at least five cards in each suit and typically an opening hand. Point count requirements vary, but it is commonly agreed that an overcall using this convention is constructive and should be made on hands that hold the prospect of winning the auction. When made on very weak hands, the chances are the opponents will win the auction and will have been warned about the unbalanced holding, leading to games that would not have been bid otherwise. Given that a bid using the Copenhagen convention is forcing for one round, most partnerships apply no upper limit to its high card strength. To use the convention, when the opponents make a one level opening, you make one of three bids. To show the bottom two unbid suits, bid 2 NT. To show the top and bottom unbid suits, bid 3. To show the top two unbid suits, bid 3. If the opponents have bid two suits, both at the one level, then the only overcall is 2 NT, which shows the two unbid suits. As opposed to Michaels cuebids, the 3 and 3 jump overcalls aren’t available as natural bids. Bids at the two level (barring 2 NT) are natural. The Copenhagen convention is more precise in terms of uniquely defining the specific suits denoted than standard Michaels cuebids. However, the lowest level the hand can be played at is the three level, and rarely will a nine card trump suit fit be found. This goes against the Law of Total Tricks, which states the three level should have at least a nine card fit.

He also played in the National Football League for the Milwaukee Badgers and New York Giants. He is best known for becoming the first person to have played outside linebacker. Military service After graduating from South Side High School in Newark, New Jersey,John Alexander Stats, Pro- Football-Reference.com. Accessed March 11, 2018. Alexander worked in his father's jewelry business before enlisting in the United States Army. During his time in the Army, Alexander served under General John Pershing, who was attempting to end Pancho Villa's raids along the US-Mexican border in 1916. Shortly after being discharged, Alexander found himself again in the Army again as an officer fighting in the First World War. Rutgers After the war, Alexander enrolled at Rutgers University. While enrolled at Rutgers, he played football under head coach George Sanford and his assistant coach Paul Robeson, who was an All-American end while at Rutgers in 1917 and 1918. According to Alexander it was Robeson's suggestion that led to him experimenting with a new style of defense, which eventually became the outside linebacker position. Pro football Alexander and Robeson travelled to Massillon, Ohio in 1919. There they joined the Massillon Tigers of the \\"Ohio League\\" and would play football for money on Sundays. While with the Tigers Alexander played alongside the likes of Gus Dorais, Bob Higgins, Lou Little, Jock Sutherland, Tiny Thornhill, Greasy Neale and Knute Rockne. In 1919, the Tigers came in second in the \\"Ohio League\\". When the National Football League was formed in 1920, Alexander did not join the league. He instead played for several independent teams such as the Gilberton Cadamounts, Coaldale Big Green, Melrose Athletic Club and Millville Big Blue. However, in 1922, he joined the NFL and played for the Milwaukee Badgers. On October 1, 1922, Alexander made football history while playing for the Badgers against the Chicago Cardinals. In that NFL game, he became the first person to ever play the outside linebacker position. While nobody though much of change in position at the time a reporter for the Milwaukee Sentinel reported on the new position but didn't refer to it as the outside linebacker. The name would come later. After his stint with the Badgers, Alexander played on several teams located in the New York Metropolitan area. However, in 1926 he played for the New York Giants. Although he liked playing for them, John did not return for the 1927 season because, he was told that he had to take a cut in pay from $100 a game to $75. He played for several Metropolitan teams until 1930, when he was forced to retire due to tuberculosis.
