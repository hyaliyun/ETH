Wallace Kellett in 1941 William Wallace Kellett (also W. Wallace Kellett) (December 20, 1891 ‚Äì July 22, 1951) was an American aircraft executive and manufacturer, especially associated with rotary-wing aircraft. He was president of Kellett Autogiro Corporation and Republic Aviation Corporation. His company constructed the first successful wingless aircraft in the United States.  Early life and education  Kellett was born in Boston, Massachusetts on December 20, 1891. His parents were William W. Kellett and Frances Revere (Flagler) Kellett. His family was wealthy. Kellett graduated from Princeton University with a bachelor of letters in 1913. Kellett attended Chestnut Hill Academy, then went to Princeton University. Upon graduation, he became associated with the Liquid Carbonic Company that manufactured soda fountains in Kansas City. During World War I he enlisted and first drove an ambulance in Europe for the American Field Service. Later he became a pilot in the French Air Force. The flying experiences gave him an interest in aviation that would last the rest of his life. Kellett earned a French G√©n√©ral de corps d'arm√©e citation and an Italian Service Medal during World War I.  Aviation career  1938 mail delivery demonstration by an autogyro at Washington D.C. capital lawn Kellett became an aviation enthusiast after his Army service and he entered into the aircraft manufacturing business in 1919. He established an autogyro company under a license from Autogiro Company of America. He made rotary-wing military aircraft for the United States Army Air Corps. Kellett was known internationally in the aviation field as a pioneer in the development of autogyros and helicopters. Through his company Kellett constructed the first successful wingless aircraft in the United States. He also built the first fleet of rotary-wing military aircraft for the United States Army Air Corps. Kellett was the president of the Aero Club of Pennsylvania 1923‚Äì25. In 1929 he founded the Kellett Autogiro Corporation with his brother Rodney and Charles Townsend Ludington and his brother Nicholas. They licensed and further developed the seminal designs of Harold Frederick Pitcairn and Juan de la Cierva for an autogyro. He promoted his autogyro as being useful as that of an automobile. Under the corporate umbrella, Kellett's company made some thirty-eight aircraft for military and civilian customers. Kellett started a campaign in Washington D.C. to get a government contract to carry mail for short distances after his KD-1B autogyro proved its airworthiness in 1935. A demonstration of mail delivery was made at the Capital in early of 1938 to get congressional approval for funding. It was decided to carry mail using an autogyro on an experimental basis and Congress passed laws accordingly. The first autogyro used by the United States Post Office Department to carry mail was produced by Kellett. It flew between the Camden Central Airport in New Jersey and the main post office at Philadelphia. The roof was 100,000 square feet and specially designed for autogyro landings. The Kellett vehicle flew same day delivery of mail, where it took overnight before.

He resigned from Republic in 1945 and directed his attention to his Corporation. The Kellett Autogiro Corporation had changed its name in 1943 to Kellett Aircraft Corporation to reflect that they were also a manufacturer of helicopters. His company made several different prototype helicopters for the United States Army Air Corps, however never obtained permanent contracts from the government. Hughes Aircraft Company instead obtained many of these helicopter contracts. Kellett eventually went out of the aircraft business in 1949 and his company became a subcontractor of aircraft assemblies in 1950.

El-Hawary"},{"id":"51274320","text":"Scarlett Raven (born 1986) is an English painter who paints impressionism paintings using a style called Augmented reality. Early life and education She is the daughter of the musician Raphael Ravenscroft known for his famous saxophone riff in the song \\"Baker Street\\" by Gerry Rafferty. She is the granddaughter of Trevor Ravenscroft who wrote the occult book \\"The Spear of Destiny\\" in 1972. Raven studied fine art at Central St Martins. Career Raven began as a fine artist choosing paint and canvas as her primary medium, but now identifies as an Augmentist. She paints Impressionism, but uses augmented reality to reveal a richer experience behind the creation of each painting. Raven's original works have been purchased by notable personalities including Orlando Bloom, Take That band member Mark Owen, Jim Beach manager of rock group Queen and many more. Raven's approach has developed a body of work that takes the visual element of a painting beyond the canvas through the use of Augmented Reality. Augmented Reality allows an immersive experience of her art. It enables Raven to document the creative journey and offers a new method of artistic expression. The concept Raven has pioneered has been described as bridging a gap between digital and tangible art and she is now considered by some as the World's First Augmented Reality Fine Artist.  Augmentism  Augmented reality being used to bring paintings to life and extend Scarlett's artistic expression Augmentism aims to merge paint with pixels. Augmentism offers an artist the ability to express their creativity, experience of life and spectrum of emotions through a multi-layered process that uses a range of media, technologies and art forms e.g. augmented reality, digital photography, painting, music, and animation. In 2012 Raven used her body as a canvas to create a stop-motion film, the film documented her painting process. Speaking on the film Raven said she \\"liked the idea that art in analogue form could embrace a digital medium.\\" Raven is mentored and managed by digital artist Marc Marot, Marot was the first to encourage Raven to develop the initial concept further and explore the idea of using Augmented Reality in her paintings. Since adopting the process people can now stand in front of Raven's paintings and use technology to interact with the physical canvas. Raven embeds a number of inputs into the artwork, at first physically with paint, then digitally using a variety of techniques. The full experience of the paintings can then be unlocked by using the Blippar app. To produce an Augmented Reality painting it takes tens of thousands of images, overlaid and layered. Creating an Augmented Reality painting is a process that is constantly evolving and growing more complex, incorporating different techniques such as blue screen, time-lapse, stop-motion and sound tracks. Raven has said exploring the route of Augmented Reality has changed the way she works immeasurably, commenting: \\"The process has evolved my relationship with art forever.\\" The layers beneath Raven's paintings are accessed using the Blippar app. Blippar is one of a selection of technology companies that make Augmented Reality possible. This technology delivers a capability that makes immersive art accessible to mobile device users. Raven's motive behind using Augmentism is driven by her desire to encourage people to engage with artwork beyond the canvas and beyond the gallery.  Exhibitions  Scarlett's work can be found at The Danger Tree exhibit in Liverpool, England. The Danger Tree - A Visual Arts Experience In 2012, Raven's father, Raphael Ravenscroft, visited France and traveled to the location of The Somme. He visited the original Danger Tree, a feature which marked the spot where, in 1916, troops from The Newfoundlanders‚Äîpart of the 29th British Division ‚Äì gathered for shelter on the opening day of the Battle of the Somme. The tree marks the spot where many of the Newfoundlanders lost their lives. Ravenscroft took a memento of soil from the ground where the Danger Tree once stood. When Ravenscroft died, Raven made the same journey to the Danger Tree which inspired the 2016 exhibition. Raven said: ‚ÄúI felt an enormous loss. I also felt a huge connection, through my father, with that part of history. That became the catalyst for The Danger Tree exhibition. I wanted to draw attention to the humanity behind the horror. It is my interpretation of a devastating, yet also touching, part of human history.‚Äù The exhibition features ten oil on canvas paintings, each triggers augmented reality layers. These integrated elements include photographs, audio recordings, text, animated graphics, archive film, music and sound effects. She was also seen at Queen Themed, an exhibition of Queen Elizabeth in celebration of her 90th birthday. The show was at Art Below on Jun 17-Aug 17, 2016. Her art is featured at The 11th Hour at Castle Fine Art gallery in Birmingham, England. One in Four Mental health charity MIND helped Raven through a difficult period in her life. She created and donated an oil and mixed media AR painting called \\"One In Four\\" for them to auction. The layers beneath this work tell the story of Scarlett's battle with anxiety.

Paglia became a Dominican after hearing Dominic of Osma preach in Bologna and exhibited exceptional pastoral zeal in his duties which included being appointed as provincial of the Roman branch of Dominicans. Paglia had popular devotion that endured in the centuries after his death and the confirmation of this devotion - or 'cultus' - allowed for Pope Leo XII to confirm the late priest's beatification on 26 March 1828. Life Nicola Paglia was born in 1197 in Giovinazzo near Bari in Apulia to nobles. He was noted as being pious and studious in his childhood. In his childhood an angel appeared to him and ordered that he forever abstain from eating meat. In 1217 he travelled to Bologna for the completion of his education where he heard Dominic of Osma preach. Paglia was so moved from Dominic's sermon that as soon as Dominic exited the pulpit he rushed over and asked him for immediate admission into the Order of Preachers where he would later be ordained to the priesthood; he received his habit from Dominic himself. Paglia - during his period of novitiate - exhibited an exceptional determination to make great progress in his spiritual life towards God and was known to convert Jewish people to the Christian faith. Paglia served two terms as provincial of the order's Roman province and he founded convents in Perugia where he settled in. Pope Gregory IX also commissioned him to visit several monasteries and to preach a crusade against the Saracens. Near the end of his life he obtained permission to fade from his public and active pastoral career to dedicate his time to preparation for his approaching death. Paglia died at the beginning of 1256.

He is currently an Emeritus Professor at the University of York, and was previously a Royal Society Research Professor. Since 1982 he has been Chair of the Royal Society Working Group on human embryo research, stem cells and cloning. He was the President of the Institute of Biology from 2006 to 2008, President of the Institute of Animal Biotechnology from 1986 to 2006 and is currently Chair of Trustees of the Animals in Science ‚Äì Education Trust. Early life and education Gardner was born in Dorking, Surrey. His father, a professional artist specialising in stained glass, was killed a few weeks later during the landings on Sicily. Gardner was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead and later studied Natural Sciences at St Catharine's College, Cambridge before doing a PhD in the University's Physiology Department with Nobel Laureate, Robert Edwards. In 1973 he was appointed to a University Lectureship at Oxford where, from 1978 until his retirement in 2008, he held a Royal Society Research Professorship. Scientific career Gardner pioneered the transplantation of cells and tissues between blastocyst stage mouse embryos and their reconstruction from their component tissues. He was the first to apply clonal analysis to study cell fate and potency in mammals, and used this strategy to provide conclusive evidence against early segregation of the mammalian germline. Blastocyst injection was later adopted almost universally for assessing the developmental potential of embryonic stem (ES) cells and their competence to colonise the germline following genetic modification. With Robert Edwards, he also established proof of principle for preimplantation genetic diagnosis. His main research interests include investigating the fate and deployment of cells in early mammalian development with particular emphasis on clonal analysis, establishing the origin and efficient derivation of stem cells from early embryos, and determining the extent to which pre-patterning normally directs early development in mammals. For many years Gardner chaired the Royal Society's ad hoc committee on 'human embryo research', and later its working group on 'stem cells and cloning' and in this role he often advised on the scientific and ethical implications of cloning, attempting to clarify the complexities of the topic for a public audience. He served as President of the Institute of Animal Technology from 1986 to 2006 and the Institute of Biology (now the Royal Society of Biology) from 2006 to 2008. He is a trustee of the Edwards and Steptoe Research Trust and chair of the Animals in Science Education Trust.

The last spiritual leader of the ancient Jewish community of Iraq, he moved to Israel ahead of the Jewish masses when they were finally airlifted there in 1952. An anti-Zionist, in his later years Mutzafi served as the Av Beth Din of the Sephardi Edah HaHaredith, and rabbi of the Shemesh Sedaqah Synagogue in Jerusalem.  Early life and marriage  Yaakov Mutzafi was born in Baghdad, Ottoman Iraq, the son of Ezra Mutzafi and Mazal Tov. He received an early Torah education from his grandfather, Moshe Mutzafi, and his primary education at Midrash Talmud Torah alongside his life-long friend and colleague Silman Mutzafi. For his secondary education, Mutzafi was enrolled at Midrash Bet Zilkha, where he received instruction from Ephraim HaCohen, Shimon Agassi, and Sadqa Hussein, the latter with whom Mutzafi would share a lifetime of collaboration. He was later to be the student of Yehuda Fatiyah. Mutzafi married the daughter of Sasson Dangour, founder of Yeshivath Dorshei Torah, where he would subsequently continue his studies alongside Silman Hugi Aboudi.  Final years in Iraq  During the late 1930s, the British-backed Kingdom of Iraq was coming under increased pressure from pro-German Arab nationalists who were constantly agitating against the royal government, with Jews and other minorities caught in the middle. The building political pressure boiled over into a bloody pogrom against the Jews in Baghdad on June 1‚Äì2, 1941, which became known as the farhud. Over 180 Jews were killed, with many more injured in the violence. Mutzafi raced to open up the gates of Midrash Bet Zilkha to the surviving Jews who were evicted from their homes, and arranged for their upkeep via donations received from philanthropists in the community.Hakhmei Bavel, Hebrew; Yeshivath Hod Yosef Publishing House, ppg. 229-230  Move to Jerusalem  Shemesh Sedaqah Synagogue in 2016 With the tumultuous years of World War II over, the long history of the Jews in Iraq was entering its final phase. With the founding of the new state of Israel, Jewish life in the Arab world was becoming more precarious by the day. Although he spent countless hours tending to the spiritual needs of the community, Mutzafi reasoned that there could be no viable future left for the Jews in Iraq. He had previously spent one month visiting with his former teacher Sadqa Hussein in Jerusalem, and in 1950 he finally moved there. He immediately took up scholarly residence at Shemesh Sedaqah Synagogue, where he was to serve as hazzan and rosh yeshiva, at first under the wing of his master. Upon the latter's death in 1961, Mutzafi inherited the full mantle of spiritual leadership of the transplanted community in Israel. Mutzafi could be seen, adorned in jellabiya and fez, giving council and administering blessings to Jews of various persuasions in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood.  Politics  Mutzafi served as Av Beth Din of the Sephardi Edah HaHaredith, an organization more closely associated with the anti-Zionist rabbis of the Ashkenazi Old yishuv. Mutzafi shared the same beliefs as his fellows in the Edah regarding their disassociation from the Israeli government, most notably regarding the ban on taking part in elections to the Knesset,Ifergan, Shimon; \\"Worry in the Religious Parties Over Loss of Seats Due To Boycott Of Elections\\", Hebrew; Mako.co.il even encouraging participation in Neturei Karta demonstrations.

The Constitution of the German Confederation () or November Constitution (Novemberverfassung) was the constitution of the German federal state at the beginning of the year 1871. It was enacted on January 1, 1871. This is a slightly changed version of the Constitution of the North German Confederation; it is not to be confused with the constitutional laws of the German Confederation of 1815. The Constitution of the German Confederation of 1871 incorporated agreements between the North German Confederation and some the South German states that joined the Confederation: with Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt, but not Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg. The new constitution appeared on 31 December 1870 in the Bundesgesetzblatt des Norddeutschen Bundes (North German Federal Law Gazette) and came into effect the following day. Already on 16 April 1871 the country exchanged it with another constitution which was valid until the end of the German Empire in 1918. There are four different constitutions or texts to distinguish between: # The 'Constitution of the North German Confederation' (Verfassung des Norddeutschen Bundes, Norddeutsche Bundesverfassung, NBV) from 16 April 1867. It came into effect on 1 July 1867. # The 'Constitution of the German Confederation' (Verfassung des Deutschen Bundes) as a text which was added to one of the November treaties: the agreement between the North German Confederation and Hessen-Darmstadt and Baden. # The 'Constitution of the German Confederation' (Verfassung des Deutschen Bundes, Deutsche Bundesverfassung, DBV) as the constitutional text which appeared in the Federal Law Gazette on 31 December 1870. The Constitution, in spite of its title, already names the federal state 'German Empire' (Deutsches Reich). It came into effect the following day, 1 January 1871.Ernst Rudolf Huber: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789. Vol. III: Bismarck und das Reich. 3rd edition, W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart [u. a.] 1988, p. 747. # The 'Constitution of the German Empire' of 16 April 1871, which came into effect on 4 May 1871. This is usually the constitution called the Bismarcksche Reichsverfassung (BRV or RV). In all of those four texts, the political system remains the same. The changes relate mainly to the agreements with the South German states regarding their accession to the North German Confederation. For example the number of delegates to the Federal Council were adjusted. All this was executed in a rather messy way. Constitutional historian Ernst Rudolf Huber called the constitution of 1 January 1871 a 'Monstrum'.Ernst Rudolf Huber: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789. Vol. III: Bismarck und das Reich. 3rd edition, W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart [u. a.] 1988, p. 757. The constitution of 1 January 1871 was one step from the North German Confederation to the German Empire. Those steps did not create a new state but concerned the accession of the South German states. The North German Confederation was renamed, and some of its organs received a new title. The constitution of 1 January 1871 did have lasting significance in the German Empire despite of the new constitution of 4 May 1871: article 80 (not repeated in the new constitution) transformed most of the North German laws into Imperial laws.

Currently she lives in Cologne, Germany. She has joined as the Artistic Director of Akademie der Kunste der Welt in Cologne since 2018. Dutta has been selected for the Lifetime Achievement Award for documentaries in connection with the 12th International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala (IDSFFK) to be held from June 21 to 26.  Work  Madhusree Dutta brought art practices, activism and pedagogy together in one platform as early as in 1990 when she curated EXPRESSION, the first feminist arts festival. The festival witnessed coming together of feminist scholars, women artists and women's movement activists, and is regarded as a landmark in the history of feminism in India. Her works generally contemplates on gender construction, urban development, public arts and documentary practices. Most of her works are situated within a hybrid form engaging multiple genres and a provocative mixing of high art and low art. Her works often display a flamboyant mix of pedagogical, political and experimental indicating towards her multiple identities as political activist and avant garde artist. Some of the artists, across disciplines and practices, whom she has collaborated with are filmmaker Philip Scheffner and photo artist Ines Schaber from Berlin, theater director Anuradha Kapur from Delhi, visual artist Nilima Sheikh from Baroda and Archana Hande and architect Rohan Shivkumar from Mumbai, playwright Malini Bhattacharya from Kolkata. The same pursuit has also led to several digital archiving projects and pedagogical initiatives. One such project Godaam is available online in the free access site PADMA (Public Access Digital Media Archive). Madhusree Dutta is a co-founder of Majlis (1990), an institution that works on cultural activism and women's rights in Mumbai. She functioned as executive director of the institution till March 2016. She is also a founding member of Akademie Der K√ºnste Der Welt (Academy of Arts of the World) in Cologne and member of the academic council of School of Environment & Architecture, Mumbai. She has been an active member of the women's movement in India and the World Social Forum (WSF) process, and has made major contribution by producing, mobilizing and disseminating arts and artists for the movements. On 5 October 2015 she participated in a nationwide movement spearheaded by the writers and filmmakers of India to protest against the cultural policy of the state and returned the National Awards as part of the protest. = Theatre = Dutta began her career with a Bengali theatre group Anarjya (non-Aryans) in Kolkata. She was also a member of cadre of Sachetana, a feminist group in Kolkata. For Anarjya and Sachetana she directed plays both for proscenium and street theatre. A Bengali adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children, and an anti-dowry musical by Malini Bhattacharya ‚Äì Meye Dile Sajiye (Giving Away the Girl) are considered as two most memorable directorial works of her during that period. In Mumbai too she was active in theatre for a few years before getting fully involved with visual arts. She directed a popular street play for the women's movement ‚Äì Nari Itihas ki Talash mein (In search of Women's History) in 1988 and an adaptation of Aristophanes‚Äô Lysistrata ‚Äì Aaj Pyar Bandh (Love is on Strike) in 1991. She has even dabbled with television serial in her salad days and directed a 13-episode Gujarati serial for her friend producer-actor Meenal Patel (1989‚Äì1990). = Films = The first film made by her is I Live in Behrampada (1993). The documentary made on a Muslim ghetto in the context of communal riots in Mumbai 1992-93 received Filmfare Award for best documentary in 1994. The film turned out to be a serious discursive material for conflict study and the script of it was published in an anthology - Politics of Violence: From Ayodhya to Behrampada, eds. John McGuire, Peter Reeves and Howard Brasted, Sage Publication,1996. Subsequently, she has made several films ‚Äì documentary, shorts, video spots and non-fiction features.

Claude Firmin Bernicat (13 January 1842 ‚Äì 5 March 1883) was a 19th-century French operetta composer.  Biography  Bernicat was born in Lyon. He moved to Paris in the mid-1860s and studied music with Jules Duprato, probably at the Conservatoire de Paris. He began his career in Parisian caf√©-concerts. Early in his career, he composed some short operas for the Paris theatre L'Eldorado. He also made his living as a music arranger and orchestrator for composers including Robert Planquette and wrote songs for the stars of the era: Le Chemin des noisettes or La Pigeonne. He wrote about thirty works, most one-act operettas and humorous or sentimental skits, for example Ali Pot-d‚Äôrhum (1869), Les Cadets de Gascogne, Le Cornette or Une aventure de la Clairon. He eventually attracted the attention of the Director of the Fantaisies-Parisiennes in Brussels, who produced his first work in three acts, Les Beignets du Roi (1882), with a libretto by Albert Carr√© and Paul Ferrier. The piece was a success, but Bernicat did not attend because his fragile health did not allow him to leave Paris. He then wrote the libretto and began composition for an op√©ra comique, Fran√ßois les bas-bleus, before he died of tuberculosis at the age of 41. His publisher, Enoch & Costallat, asked Andr√© Messager to complete the score. The opera premiered at the Folies-Dramatiques in Paris in 1884, running for 131 performances. It was then regularly revived in Paris.

History  Dar Othman was built in the end of the sixteenth century (around 1595) by Othman, dey of Tunis, who reigned from 1593 to 1610. During the first half of the 19th century, Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud transformed it into a provision's house to store supplies for soldiers staying in barracks of the neighborhood. Thus, the palace is also called Dar Al Oula (provision's house). Afterwards, the residence was bequeathed by Muhammad III as-Sadiq to his grand vizier Mustapha Ben Isma√Øl. In 1936, the palace got classified as an historical monument. It was first allocated to the National Institute of Archaeology and Art (known these days as the National Heritage Institute). Nowadays, it is the headquarters of the preservation of the medina of Tunis.  Description  The facade of the residence is composed of two lintels of arch-stone separated by a pointed horseshoe arch and a wooden pergola over the door. It also has two Andalusian style columns in the lower part and two Hafsid style columns in the upper part. The entrance door leads to a driba (square vestibule). The floor is paved with Kadhal flagstones. Walls are surrounded by stone benches. The ceiling, which rises in stages from bottom to top, is decorated with an Andalusian style stucco-work. The vestibule leads to the courtyard which has only two porticoes (unlike the majority of the medina's palaces which are surrounded by four porticoes). Four T-shaped rooms surround the courtyard.

Metropole‚Äôs motto ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a stranger‚Äù captures its main goal: To help its readers get acquainted with Austria and its capital Vienna in particular.  Distribution/Circulation  The magazine has a circulation of about 30,000 copies, on sale at more than 500 locations within Austria: at newsstands, train stations, airports and bookshops. It‚Äôs also available as a print or digital subscription and digitally on flights of Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines. In addition, the magazine targets its readership directly through a corporate subscription model to reach the employees of international organizations and companies. Metropole appears quarterly in March, June, September and December. The media house also provides daily online coverage in English on things happening in Vienna and Austria, a weekly newsletter and monthly events for subscribers and internationals.  Contents  Each issue has a thematic focus that defines the main sections, such as the Editorials, the Cover Story and the Quotes, Stats & Numbers. Apart from that, Metropole features event tips, interesting locations, and portrays Vienna‚Äôs city life and neighborhoods (Gr√§tzl). Besides contributions by regular authors, each issue features guest-contributors in line with the main topic. The magazine shouldn‚Äôt be regarded as just a tourist guide, but as a way to help those who are new to Vienna, find their way in the city. Digital content featured in the print magazine is only accessible to subscribers, but coverage of current news online and the event calendar are available for everyone to read.  History  In October 2015, Margaret Childs and Dardis McNamee co-founded Home Town Media GmbH and published the first issue of Metropole, titled ‚ÄúWe Built This City‚Äù, focusing on how internationality shaped Austria and Vienna and continues to do so. In 2018, Metropole initiated the transnational and intercultural reportage project ‚ÄúEmpire to Republic.‚Äù Using contemporary and archival photographs, original reporting and first-hand experiences, the project sought to tell the story of the region 100 years after the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire in 1918. The stories created by over 50 journalists from 13 Central and European countries appeared monthly in Metropole and in partnering news outlets. In 2019, Home Town Media published the book From Empire to Republic, a compilation of the project‚Äôs best reporting. In 2019, Metropole changed from appearing monthly (10 issues a year) to quarterly, with more frequent online content offered as part of this relaunch. In 2021, Metropole plans to expand to new cities, starting with Europe. The goal is to build a city magazine that is hyper- local, helping the globally mobile live anywhere like they were born there. The founders and many of the contributors to the magazine were formerly associated with The Vienna Review, a previous English-language monthly, which ceased publication at the end of 2013. Events and other products Metropole regularly organizes events for its readers as well as startups, companies and international influencers. The aim is for guests to exchange ideas and visions, expand their network and get a sense of the possibilities that working and living in Austria offers. Home Town Media, Metropole's parent company and publishing house, also publishes Survival Guides for English speakers in Vienna. The Vienna Survival Guide for Health, published in 2017, provides a detailed overview of health care, doctors, insurance, and medical treatment in Vienna and Austria. The Vienna Survival Guide for Housing, published in 2018, is an easy-to-understand guide for the city‚Äôs real estate, with a breakdown of Vienna‚Äôs neighborhoods and explanations of how to rent and buy property in Austria as an expat. In 2019, the Vienna Survival Guide for Education followed, covering school enrollment, studying and further education in Vienna and the rest of Austria.

Since 1907, it has been an official breeding site for the Morgan horse, one of the first American-bred horse breeds, and Vermont's official state animal. The breeding program was established in Burlington in 1905, and moved to this site in 1907 by the United States Department of Agriculture, and is now run by the University of Vermont. The farm is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description and history The Morgan Horse Farm is located on the east side of Morgan Horse Farm Road, on Weybridge's east side, on overlooking Otter Creek. A broad lawn separates the farm's main cluster of buildings from the road, prominently featuring a statue of Figure the founding sire of the Morgan horse breed. The property includes a 19th-century mansard-roofed barn with Second Empire styling, and a historic brick Greek Revival house, built for one of the early farmers of the land. with The Morgan horse breed traces its origins to the activities of Justin Morgan, who purchased Figure in the 1790s. The breed saw widespread expansion and use throughout the United States in the 19th century, spawning several other important breeds. In 1905, the United States Department of Agriculture established a breeding program on the campus of the University of Vermont in Burlington. Two years later, it moved to this property, donated by Joseph Battell, founder of the American Morgan Register. The facilities were turned over to the University of Vermont in 1951. The site is a tourist attraction for aficionados of Morgan horses, and continues to be a leader in the development of the breed.

Establishment After helping to unify Vietnam under the Nguyen Dynasty, the French Navy began its heavy presence in the Mekong Delta and later colonised the southern third of Vietnam including Saigon in 1867. Central Vietnam later became the French protectorate of Annam and French influence in the Indochina Peninsula strengthened. During the Sino-French War (1884‚Äì85), the northernmost part of Vietnam, Tonkin (then considered a crucial foothold in Southeast Asia and a key to the Chinese market) was invaded by the French. After the Treaty of Tientsin, all of Vietnam was governed by the French. During the French colonial administration, Vietnam was administratively divided into three different territories: Tonkin (in the north), Annam (in the centre), and the colony of Cochinchina (in the south). These territories were fairly arbitrary in their geographic extent as the vast majority of the Vietnamese regarded their country as a single land and minor resistance to French rule continued over the next 70 years to achieve an independent state. Annam and Tonkin were originally a single entity, the R√©sidence sup√©rieure of Annam-Tonkin. On June 3, 1886, the Nguy·ªÖn Emperor ƒê·ªìng Kh√°nh delegated all of his powers in Tonkin to a Kinh luoc su (equivalent of Viceroy), who acted under French supervision. On May 9, 1889, the R√©sidence sup√©rieure of Annam-Tonkin was abolished, with Annam and Tonkin being separated in two R√©sidences sup√©rieures, each subordinated to the Governor- General of French Indochina. On July 26, 1897, Governor-General Paul Doumer had Emperor Th√†nh Th√°i abolish the post of Kinh luoc su. Also the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty still nominally reigned over Tonkin, it was now de facto under direct French rule.Pierre Brocheux and Daniel H√©mery, Indochine : la colonisation ambigu√´ 1858‚Äì1954, La D√©couverte, 2004, p. 78-81 During French rule, Hanoi was made capital of Tonkin and, in 1901, of the whole French Indochina. Cities in Tonkin saw significant infrastructure and economic development under the French, such as the development of the port of Haiphong and construction of the Trans-Indochinois Railway linking Hanoi to Saigon. Under French economic plans, mines yielding gold, silver, and tin as well as the farming of rice, corn, and tea powered Tonkin's economy. The imports included rice, iron goods, flour, wine, opium and cotton goods. Industrialization later led to the opening of factories producing textiles and China for export throughout the French Empire. French cultural influence on Tonkin was also significant as French became the primary language of education, government, trade and media and heavy Catholic missionary activity resulted in almost 10% of the population identifying as Catholic by the 1940s. Prominent buildings in Hanoi were also constructed during the period of French rule, such as the Hanoi Opera House and the Hanoi University of Technology. Administration Tonkin was a component of French Indochina. It was a de facto French colony despite being a protectorate on paper. The British Naval Intelligence Division wrote during World War II that \\"at first the native political organization was maintained, but in 1897 the office of the viceroy, representing the king of Annam in Tonkin, was abolished, and since then other changes have further weakened the influence of the native government.\\"Naval Intelligence Division, 203‚Äì204. Tonkin was administered by a French resident similar to those in Annam, Laos, and Cambodia, but he had much greater authority because of the absence of any indigenous administration. A conseil du protectorat composed of important officials and representatives from the chambers of agriculture and commerce, assisted the resident in performing his duties. There was also an advisory council made up of Vietnamese. Tonkin was made up of 23 provinces, subdivided into phu or huyen, cantons, and communes. Local administration was in the hands of Vietnamese mandarins, although they were appointed by the resident rather than the emperor as in Annam. The smallest unit of administration, the commune, was overseen by two councils: the toc bieu, and the mandarin-dominated ky muc with the authority to veto decisions of the toc bieu. Hanoi and Haiphong had municipal councils appointed by the governor- general of Indochina. End French colonial administration lasted until March 9, 1945, during Japanese occupation (1941‚Äì1945). Although French administration was allowed during Japanese occupation as a puppet government, Japan briefly took full control of Vietnam in March 1945 under the Empire of Vietnam and Tonkin became the site of the Vietnamese Famine of 1945 during this period.L'Indochine fran√ßaise pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale , Jean- Philippe Liardet At the end of the war, the north of Vietnam (including Tonkin) saw a sphere of influence by China while the south was briefly occupied by the British for French forces to regroup and regain control. Harry Truman at the Potsdam Conference, stated an intention to hand the region back to French rule, a sharp contrast to Franklin D. Roosevelt's strong opposition to colonialism and commitment to support the Viet Minh. However, after the Japanese withdrew from Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Ba ƒê√¨nh Square. Hanoi was later reoccupied by the French and conflict between the Viet Minh and France broke out into the First Indochina War. As the French sought to establish a coherent government in Vietnam as an alternative to Ho Chi Minh, Tonkin was merged in 1948 into the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam, which was replaced the next year by the State of Vietnam, following the reunification with Cochinchina. After the French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in Western Tonkin in 1954, the Communist state of North Vietnam was formed, consisting of Tonkin and northern Annam.

The EPRDF was led by the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front and was dominated by those belonging to the Tigray ethnic group, which is a minority group comprising only about six percent of the country's population. However, members of this ethnic group have traditionally dominated senior positions in the country's military and political system, while those belonging to the Amhara and Oromo ethnic groups, who comprise a majority of the population, have felt rather marginalized over the past few decades.Ethiopia: Dozens killed in anti-government protests, Al Jazeera English, 8 Aug. 2016, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui8fcjltmlI Ethnic divisions are not as sharp in Ethiopia as might be indicated by statistics; intermarriage is extremely commonplace, and the actual disparity and disaffection between groups is not great. Furthermore, following the death of Meles Zenawi in 2012, the influence of the Tigray ethnic group became lower than in previous decades. Subsequent to his death neither of the two main political positions ‚Äì President (head of state) and Prime Minister (head of government) ‚Äì was occupied by a Tigrayan. Then President Mulatu Teshome belonged to the Oromo ethnic group and then prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn to the Wolayta ethnic group. Nevertheless, the perceived domination of the Tigray people is there in the back of the minds of some people and is a factor in the disturbances. The 2016 Oromo youth demonstrations started because Addis Ababa's new city masterplan proposed including farm lands from the surrounding Oromia region to cope with the city's rapid expansion. Amhara ethnic youth also followed the Oromos because of old bitterness towards the governing EPRDF (a party founded by the TPLF) who have abolished the century- old Amhara dominance in Ethiopian governance https://www.bbc.com/news/world- africa-36940906 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39619979 https://www.dw.com/en/anti-government-protests-growing-in-ethiopia/a-19461345 .https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/ethiopia-mass-protests-rooted-country- history-180219130441837.html =Drought and floods= In 2014, both rainy seasons in Ethiopia saw irregular rainfall. In 2015, due to an extremely strong El Ni√±o event, both rainy seasons in Ethiopia almost did not happen at all. That resulted in an acute drought in particular in the Highlands of Ethiopia, crops and pastures dried up and herds were dying. It was considered to be the worst drought in 50 years. The drought did hit particularly hard in Amhara Region and Oromia Region. After 18 months of severe drought with almost nothing left over to eat for drought-affected people, very strong torrential rains that started in April 2016 did worsen the situation until October 2016. The flooding displaced people for months in exactly the same regions, that were most affected by the long drought. Ethiopia is a multi-ethnic state. UNICEF experience in Ethiopia has shown such droughts and floodings often result in humanitarian shocks and tensions between ethnic groups. =Rural discontent= The country has been experiencing rapid economic growth since the 2000s and is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and is Africa‚Äôs second most populous country. But while economic development and growth and industrialization are supported a lot by the authoritarian government, often the needs of the rural population remain unconsidered, the freedom and civil rights of farmers and pastoralists in particular are often neglected. They are left behind. =Wolqayt Region= There has been civil unrest in the Wolqayt Region since the 1941 Woyane rebellion, which was an uprising of Tigrayans against the Ethiopian government. With the failure of the rebellion, Wolqayt as an area populated by both Amhara and Tigray people went to the (now historic) province of Begemder. The capital of Begemder was Gondar. That move gave rise to tensions between Amhara people and Tigrayans over decades. According to the 1994 Ethiopian census, out of 90,186 residents 87,099 self- identified as Tigrayans (96.6%) and 2,734 self-identified as Amharas (3.0%). According to the 2007 Ethiopian census, out of 356,598 residents of Western Tigray Zone (of which Wolqayt is a woreda), 329,080 self-identified as Tigrayans (92.3%) and 23,093 self-identified as Amhara. Following the take- over of Ethiopia by the EPRDF in 1991, the old Wolqayt was split into two parts and the northern part (the new Wolqayt with a Tigrayan majority) was moved to the newly established ethnic region of Tigray. Amhara people protested against the split and against the move ever since. Protests Prior episodes of mass killings by the Ethiopian government include the 2005 Ethiopian police massacres when hundreds of protesters were killed by police and the November and December 2015 protests in the Oromia Region that resulted in the killings of over 100 people by government forces. The 2015 protests were later followed by a police crackdown and the arrests of hundreds of opposition members. =Oromia Region= According to diplomatic, NGO, and opposition sources, hundreds of thousands of people marched in more than 200 towns and cities in the vast Oromia State, in protest at \\"the government's draconian and ever-escalating repression.\\" This resulted in at least 148 people being killed on 5 and 6 August. On 2 October 2016, more protests occurred where an estimated two million people were attending the annual Irreechaa festival in Bishoftu in the Oromia region. The festival is attended by Oromos from all walks of life to celebrate life and nature. An anti- government protest disrupted the event, with some claiming they involved peacefully chanting slogans against the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization, while others claim stones and bottles were thrown. People died in a stampede as a result of police using tear gas, rubber bullets and baton charges, falling into a deep ditch and being crushed, or drowning in a lake. While the Oromia regional government confirmed the deaths of 52 people, rights groups, the opposition leader, and local reports claim various numbers up to nearly 300 people dead. =Addis Ababa= On 6 August hundreds of protesters marched on Meskel Square and shouted \\"we want our freedom\\" and \\"free our political prisoners\\". Dozens of protesters were arrested by Addis Ababa's police.Deaths and Detentions As Protests Flare in Ethiopia , AllAfrica, Addis Standard, 8 August 2016, http://allafrica.com/view/group/main/main/id/00045142.html =Amhara Region= In July 2016 the Anti-terrorism task force detained members of the Wolqayt Amhara Identity Committee (WAIC), a legally registered organisation. Soon after, protests erupted in many areas of the Amhara Region, the historic ethnic center of the Ethiopian state and home to the spectacular monolithic rock-cut churches of Lalibela and medieval castles of Gondar that attract tourists from all over.http://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-travel- warning/3472320.html One of the biggest demonstrations took place was on 1 August 2016 in Gondar city. Hundreds of thousands of people held a peaceful demonstration over the arrest of the WAIC members, government repression and protest Federal government encroachment in regional affairs. Protesters carried placards expressing solidarity with the Oromo people.http://www.africanews.com/2016/07/31/half-a-million-protesters-call- for-a-regime-change-in-ethiopia/ As they marched, they were heard to be chanting in Amharic ‚Äú·â†·ä¶·àÆ·àù·ã´ ·ã®·àö·çà·à∞·ãâ ·ã∞·àù ·ã∞·àõ·âΩ·äï ·äê·ãâ‚Äù https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj6Gc0VqQD8 which translates to ‚Äúthe pouring of blood in Oromia is our blood‚Äù and ‚Äúthe killings of our brothers in Oromia needs to stop‚Äù. They also drew attention to the dispute over the administration of Wolqayt Tsegede. A region that is currently part of the Tigray state despite its citizens identifying as ethnic Amhara. Further demonstrations soon followed in the Amhara region. Many protests spiraled into violence as security forces fired live bullets on protesters. On 5 August 2016, 50 student protesters were killed while protesting in the populous city of Bahir Dar, the capital of the Amhara Region and a major tourist destination. Evidence collected by Ethiopian Human Rights Project has so far shown that major protests took place in 6 of the 11 zones in the Amhara Region. The zones included North Gondar, South Gondar, Bahir Dar Special, Agew Awi, East Gojam and West Gojam zones. Anti-government street demonstrations and ‚Äústay at home‚Äù protests took place in small wereda towns and in some cases in rural kebeles across the six zones. The protests that were ignited in the historic town of Gondar, quickly spread to Debarq, Debtetabor, Metema, Ambagiorgis, Wereta, Simada, Gayint, Bahr Dar, Finote Selam, Burre, Enjibara, Dangila, Chagni, Tilili, Birsheleqo, Quarit, Dembecha, Amanuel, Debre Markos and other towns. After the growing discontent in Amhara Region and Oromia Region the Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a travel warning on 1 September 2016. The Amhara Region included in the warning includes the city of Gondar, a popular site for many Israeli tourists and an area where many Ethiopian Jews originated. The warning was announced a day after the Prime Minister of Ethiopia Hailemariam Desalegn's announcement on the state owned media ETV (Ethiopia) and gave direct order for the Ethiopia Army forces to use any force necessary to bring order to the region. The protesters continued and several flower farms were burned down in Amhara Region and clashes between security forces and local protesters continued. The Ethiopian Government declared a state of emergency on October 8, 2016. On 16 October 2016 the Government announced, restrictions and prohibitions on Internet usage, postings on Facebook, crossing the wrists above the head, diplomatic travel, fire arms and the viewing of media that the government deems to be ‚Äúterrorist media‚Äù. There were also curfews in both regions from 18:00 to 06:00 to prevent further violence. The government crackdown was tough. Maina Kiai, a U.N. rights rapporteur, said \\"The scale of this violence and the shocking number of deaths make it clear that this is a calculated campaign to eliminate opposition movements and silence dissenting voices,‚Äù. The Human Rights Watch estimated that at least 400 people were killed in protests over the next several months. As a continuation of the Amhara protest, two years later several protests were held in Northern Wollo. In January of 2018, Ethiopian security forces killed seven people and wounded several others in the town of Woldia, 500km north of Addis Ababa along the main road to Mekele. Nigussu Tilahun, the head of the Amhara region‚Äôs communications bureau at the time, confirmed lives were lost but did not say how many. A huge crowd of people were parading through the streets of the town for the annual Timket festival, an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian celebration of Epiphany when a group of young men protested because the federal police forces prohibited them from making round dancing and chanting. A witness said police had fired into the crowd and the crowd began running in all directions. https://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/2018/01/20/at- least-7-people-have-been-killed-during-timket-celebration-in-woldia/ The United Nation High Commission for Human Rights (UNHRC) condemned the incident in Woldia stated that the incident ‚Äúreportedly took place when the security forces tried to stop people from chanting anti-government songs and allegedly opened fire on them. Protesters reportedly later blocked roads and destroyed a number of properties.‚Äùhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia- violence/ethiopian-protesters-killed-for-singing-anti-government-songs-u-n- idUSKBN1FC2GC This comes just two weeks after Ethiopia‚Äôs ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People‚Äôs Revolutionary Democratic Front, officially announced its intention to undertake reforms following protests that began in 2016. Seven people have also been killed in the northern town of Kobo after security forces fired on a crowd who were reportedly protesting Woldia‚Äôs killings in the nearby Woldia town. A ten-year-old boy and two members of the defence forces are among those killed. Many more were injured in the incident in the town. Protesters gathered around the town‚Äôs police station to condemn security forces brutality at a religious ceremony in Woldia town and not being held accountable in a court of law. https://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/2018/01/25/seven-killed-kobo-protest/ Later on, thousands have demonstrated, opposing the killings of innocent people at Timket festival in Woldia and calling for an end to police beatings, with protests reported in Habru districts of Mersa, Robit, Gobiye, all of the towns crossed by the main all-weather road from Addis Ababa to Mekele. In Mersa around 10 people were shot dead.https://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/2018/01/27/protests-spread-north-wollo- towns-ten-killed-mersa/ =Kaliti Prison= A suspected attempted jailbreak from Kaliti Prison near Addis Ababa resulted in a fire. Two prisoners were claimed to have been killed trying to escape, while 21 other inmates were said to have perished from \\"stampede and suffocation\\". At least 23 people were killed in total. Reactions =Domestic= The Ethiopian government denied violence was being committed by the country's security forces, naming regional rivals Eritrea and Egypt as fomenting the ongoing unrest. =International= The United States Embassy in Addis Ababa released a statement of concern. Legislation was authored by US Congressman Chris Smith, to protect civilians in Ethiopia as well as promote democracy and good governance. The legislation also ‚Äúcalls on the Secretary of State to improve the oversight and accountability of U.S. assistance in Ethiopia‚Äù. Rep. Smith was joined by U.S. Representative Mike Coffman as well as victims of torture at the hands of the Ethiopian Government Seenaa Jimjimo, Tewondrose Tirfe and Guya Abaguya Deki, during a press conference to announce this legislation.Chris Smith. 2017. Chris Smith . [ONLINE] Available at: http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=400152. [Accessed 17 February 2017]. In May 2017, Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said he would open an investigation into the human rights abuses perpetrated during the protests.

Born in Bristol, she moved with her family to London and spent some time in Europe, before returning to become a governess to aristocratic families including that of Lord Leven. In 1815, she wrote her first book on education, drawing on the ideas of Sarah Trimmer, building a strong reputation. Appleton went on to found a school for young ladies, was consulted in the education of Princess Charlotte and was possibly asked to act as governess for Princess Victoria. Biography Elizabeth Appleton was born in 1790, in Castle Street in Bristol. Her father had a strong affinity for the music and spent much of the family's fortune on furthering that interest. Believing his son, Appleton's eldest brother, to be a musical prodigy, he moved the family to London and found himself work at the Kidbrook Park estate. Appleton's brother died before realising his musical potential, and her father died soon after in 1802. Appleton had a sporadic education, as a charity student in one school and then a day pupil in another. She eventually became interested in becoming a teacher. At the age of 14, she spent some time in France with her governess and in 1811, following an argument with her mother, she spent three years on the continent. On her return to England, Appleton became a governess for highborn families including the 9th Earl of Leven. In 1815, she wrote her first book, Private Education, or, A Practical Plan for the Studies of Young Ladies: with an address to parents, private governesses, and young ladies, she dedicated the book to the Countess of Leven. In 1825, Appleton married John Lachlan, a clergyman, buying him an advowson. Over the next few years, the Lachlans would suffer severe financial hardships, which started with the bankruptcy of her uncle. In 1832, John moved to Dunkirk to escape his debts, while Elizabeth attempted to re-establish her school. She became excessively evangelical, however, leading to a decline in her reputation. Elizabeth Lachlan died on 8 September 1849 of cholera. Works on education Appleton wrote about the education of young ladies and her views followed those of Sarah Trimmer's, that ladies should have a thorough education on subjects such as geography and astronomy. They should also have a clear understanding of morality and religion. Her books would give practical systems to help those who wanted to follow this style of education, with methodologies for different age groups and abilities, recommending reading texts to help. At the same time she advocated better pay and pensions for those women who entered the field of education. In 1822, Appleton had set up a school for young ladies in Portland Place, London, and by 1825 she was earning ¬£4,000 per year () from it. Appleton had written a number of educational texts by this point, had been consulted on the education of Princess Charlotte and supposedly even asked to be governess for Princess Victoria.

They argue the wording of the grant is for the granting of municipal status rather than being an actual city.

Patrizi joined the order in Lecceto and lived as a hermit prior to his sudden death while visiting his friend at another convent. Patrizi was beatified on 1 March 1804 after Pope Pius VII confirmed the late priest's longstanding 'cultus' - or popular and enduring devotion. Life Antonio Patrizi was born in Siena at the beginning of 1280 as the son of Pietro and Ginerva Patrizi into the prominent house of Patrizi with its origins from Rome. In 1287 he was entrusted to the Order of Preachers for his studies. On one particular Christmas Eve night in the Basilica di San Domenico he was inspired to visit on Christmas the hospital of Santa Maria della Scala where he met Pietro de' Piccolomini who suggested that the two both go to enroll in the Order of Saint Augustine at Lecceto; the two left on 26 December and were admitted into the novitiate. He was appointed at one point as the prior of his Lecceto convent. Patrizi died sometime just after midnight on 23 April 1311 at the convent of Monticiano where he was spending the night while on a visit to his Florentine friend Pietro da Collegonzi. On the night he died an old and ill couple who lived next to the convent looked out the window to see a brilliant light pointing to the heavens and so believed it was a fire but then thought a pious man touching the heavens resided there. The couple was healed of their illnesses and went to the convent in the hopes of meeting this pious man - the friars went to Patrizi's cell but found him dead. His remains were interred in a grave where it was said to have caused lilies to grow during the wintertime. His incorrupt remains were later transferred to the local church of Santi Pietro e Paolo - later renamed in his honor - and were transferred on two more occasions in 1616 and 1700. Beatification Patrizi received formal beatification from Pope Pius VII on 1 March 1804 after the latter ratified the late priest's local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - that had endured since the late priest's death.

The scheme was launched in 2013 by the charity The Reading Agency and the Society of Chief Librarians with funding from Arts Council England. The scheme initially provided reading lists for common mental health conditions (including anger, anxiety, depression, phobias, and self-harm), but extended this offer to include reading lists for mood-busting books, dementia, young people, and long term conditions. The books on the lists are endorsed by health experts, and can be recommended by GPs or other health professionals, or borrowed without referral from public libraries in England. The scheme was based on a similar scheme in Wales, which was set up by Professor Neil Frude in 2003 (the Welsh assembly made it available nationally in 2005). Neil Frude said \\"The doctors are already there, the books are already there and so are the libraries. It just needed joining them up.\\" The scheme is supported by evidence which suggests reading can improve health and wellbeing and its effectiveness is evaluated annually. Results show that in its first year the scheme reached 275,000 people, and libraries saw a 113% increase in loans of the titles on the list. Support The scheme has the support of bodies including the Royal College of General Practitioners, Royal College of Nursing, and Mind. In January 2015, the scheme was expanded to include books to assist people affected by dementia, whether directly or as carers. Libraries Local public library systems are supporting the scheme in various ways, including making the books available in branches, providing access through their catalogues, and promoting the lists and the books. In 2015, the findings of a two-year evaluation report into the Reading Well Books on Prescription scheme were published; it claimed that there had been a 97% increase in UK library loans of mental health self-help books, and a 346% increase in the number of books for people with dementia borrowed from libraries in England. General practice Some general practices are informing patients about the Reading Well lists as part of their patient information websites. Book lists A book list on common mental health conditions in adults was created in 2013. It was followed by a list for people with dementia and their carers in 2015, and the \\"Reading Well for Young People\\" list, aimed at the 13‚Äì18 age group and including fiction such as The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, in 2016.

It is a truthful mechanism with strategic properties that make it particularly suitable to complex auctions such as the radio spectrum reallocation auction.  Example  Suppose the government wants to sell broadcasting rights in two areas: North and South. Three agents compete on these rights: * Alice needs both areas, and values them (together) as $3M. * Bob needs only the North, and values it as $1M. * Carl needs only the South, and values it as $1M. The government wants to maximize the social welfare. In this case, there are two feasible allocations: either give all rights to Alice (welfare=3), or give the North to Bob and the South to Carl (welfare=2). Since the valuations are private information of the agents, the government needs to use a truthful mechanism in order to induce the agents to reveal their true valuations. We compare two types of truthful mechanisms. =Vickrey‚ÄìClarke‚ÄìGroves solution= The Vickrey‚ÄìClarke‚ÄìGroves (VCG) algorithm finds the socially-optimal allocation, which is to give both areas to Alice. Alice should pay a price determined by the externalities it imposes on the other agents. In this case, Alice pays $2M, since without her, the welfare of Bob and Carl would have been $2M. Bob and Carl receive nothing and pay nothing. A similar outcome can be implemented by an immediate acceptance (or forward-greedy) auction. This auction iteratively accepts the highest-valued agent that can still be feasibly selected, and charges them the threshold payments (the smallest bid that they should have made in order to win). In this case, Alice is selected first, so Bob and Carl can no longer be selected. Alice pays her threshold value which is $1M. =Deferred-acceptance auction solution= 2\\\\. The deferred-acceptance auction iteratively rejects the lowest-valued agent that can be rejected while keeping an optimal set of active agents. So, Carl is rejected first, then Bob. Alice remains and she is accepted. She pays the threshold value which is $1M. Both auction types are truthful - no single agent could gain by reporting a different value. However, they differ when agents can form coalitions. Suppose that Bob and Carl together increase their bid to $4M. Now, the VCG auction will accept Bob and Carl, and charge each of them a price of 0 (since each of them alone has no effect on the allocation to Alice)! In contrast, the DAA will reject Alice, then accept Bob and Carl, and charge each of them his threshold price, which is $3M - so they do not gain anything from their misreport (in fact, they lose $2M). See also The performance of deferred-acceptance auctions was analyzed by Stanford University economists Paul Milgrom and Ilya Segal in 2014. An application of this idea in a double auction setting was outlined by then-Stanford computer science researchers including Tim Roughgarden in 2014 that same year. = Related articles = *Japanese auction *Vickrey‚ÄìClarke‚ÄìGroves (VCG) auction References Types of auction ","title":"Deferred-acceptance auction"},{"id":"51274752","text":"Julio Iemma (born 31 July 1984) is a Venezuelan sports shooter.

She was a concert pianist, Professor of Piano at the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp . (1931-1964) and was appointed Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre de la Couronne and Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre de L√©opold. She herself was a disciple of √âmile Bosquet.note: Bosquet was born in Brussels in 1878 and died in Brussels in 1958, a virtuoso pianist of international reputation, who studied with Ferruccio Busoni. √âmile Bosquet was one of the first pianists to obtain the First Prize of the worlds‚Äô famous Anton Rubinstein Competition in Vienna in 1900.  Biography  Flore Levine Flore Levine studied at the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp with Flor Alpaerts, August De Boeck (Harmony), Lodewijk Mortelmans (Contrepoint) and in the piano class of √âmile Bosquet, for whom she kept a deep attachment for the rest of her life. In 1919, she obtained her Dipl√¥me Sup√©rieur de Piano with honors, for which she also performed the Concerto no. 1 in E Flat Major of Franz Liszt. Having also a great interest in contemporary music, Flore Levine performed numerous Premieres (among others: Darius Milhaud). As a famous concert pianist, she also performed many recitals with another pianist, Mit Scapus - Van Dommelen (who was born in Antwerp in 1892 and died in Antwerp in 1989) in her later years. Flore Levine had also a personal and a professional relationship with the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. Flore Levine was appointed Professor of Piano at the Royal Conservatory of Music of Antwerp from 1931 to 1964. After this period, she continued to teach the piano for over 25 years in various Music Schools and with private lessons. As a well- known Professor, she taught several generations of pianists among which, Lucette Alleman (see Bibliography), who obtained Virtuosity Prize of the Belgium Government in 1958 and became Laureate of the Concours international d'ex√©cution musicale de Gen√®ve that same year. Flore Levine (in the center), with her students Godelieve Berger (left), Lucette Alleman (right) As a Professor and as a Pedagogue, Flore Levine was highly appreciated by her students, to whom she conveyed respect and deep love for music. She investigated piano methods; she was in the lineage of Karl Leimer, Walter Gieseking, Heinrich Neuhaus and Marie Ja√´ll.. The quality of the sound was essential and fundamental, based on a piano technique, using suppleness and a rebound technic from the keyboard, without ever ‚Äòforcing‚Äô the way of playing. > Professor Levine could listen better than anyone on earth. She possessed the > art to express her observations and her critical comments about piano > performance with a lot of precision, without ever hurting anyone and with a > fine touch of humor. She taught the way of performing the music, by > listening to the greatest pianists, adding her observations and her > comments, while she was always looking for solutions to technical problems > (she often tried out passages in different ways, searching and demonstrating > them herself at the piano). All this was passed on with deep respect for the > interpretation and for the opinion of each student. After each piano lesson, > one would go home with a feeling of personal growth and enrichment, both on > the musical and on the human side. Flore Levine‚Äôs piano playing was shining > through a deep generous, round and broad sound. A very erudite person, she > devoted a passion for literature and for every other form of Art. She was > also very interested in ‚Äòwhat would go on in the world‚Äô.

He is notable for international studies on the epidemiology of celiac disease. He is Head of the Department of Pediatrics at the Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy; Visiting Scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, United States; and 2013-2016 President of the Italian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SIGENP). His research also includes contributions to understanding the clinical spectrum of celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders. Education and career Since 1993 he has served as a full-time Professor at the Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche in Ancona, Italy, where he currently holds the position of Head of the Department of Pediatrics and Director of the Pediatric Residency Program. He is married with Dr Eleonora Bove, a lawyer. They have a son and a daughter. Key research activities Carlo Catassi has made contributions to the international understanding of celiac disease epidemiology. He was main author of the first celiac disease screening project in the general population in the US. This study showed that celiac disease is much more common than previously thought, affecting around 1% of the US population, while often remaining undiagnosed (so-called celiac iceberg). His original findings have been replicated by hundreds of studies performed all over the world. He investigated the prevalence of celiac disease in Europe, North and South America, and Middle East countries. He and his coworkers found an extremely high prevalence of celiac disease in the Saharawi population of Arab-Berber origin (around 6%)pointing out the importance of specific environmental and genetic factors to the disease pathophysiology. He has conducted clinical trials aimed at clarifying the minimal amount of gluten needed to trigger the small intestinal damage in patients affected with celiac disease. These milestone studies formed the basis for fixing the maximum gluten contamination (20 ppm) allowed in gluten-free food by regulatory International Agencies like Codex Alimentarius and US-FDA. He is co-author of ‚ÄúFast Facts: Celiac Disease‚Äù with Geoffrey Holmes and Alessio Fasano In recent years his research activities have focused on understanding environmental factors affecting the risk of developing celiac disease, particularly weaning patterns and other aspects of infant nutrition, along with understanding other forms of gluten-related disorders, particularly non celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). He has guided the establishment of precise diagnostic criteria of NCGS, now known as Salerno‚Äôs criteria. Catassi and his co-workers recently have provided new insights into the age of gluten introduction for infants, along with the finding that breastfeeding does not appear to influence the risk of developing celiac disease in children.

Young stems are succulent, glabrous, apparently articulated, with characteristic globular to short-cylindrical lateral branches. The opposite leaves are fleshy, glabrous, sessile, joined at base and surrounding the stem, their blades reduced to small scales. The inflorescences are terminal or numerous opposite lateral, short-cylindrical or orbicular spikes. Cymes of (two to) three flowers are sitting in the axils of shield-like, opposite bracts. The mostly bisexual flowers are somewhat immersed in the inflorescence axis. The perianth consists of three subequal, membranous tepals that are loosely connate at base. There is one stamen exserting the flower and an ovoid ovary with a thick style and two stigmas. In fruit the perianth remains unchanged. The fruit is obovoid and free. The vertical seed is orange to red-brown, with slightly papillose seed coat. The seed contains the curved embryo and copious perisperm (feeding tissue).  Distribution and habitat  The distribution area of Halocnemum covers Southern Europe, the Mediterranean region, North Africa, Eastern Europe, Southwest Asia, Middle Asia to China (Xinjiang, Gansu). The plants grow in coastal salt marshes or wet inland salt flats, sabkhas, on salty clay, in salt steppes or dried river beds, up to 1200 m above sea level.  Systematics  Halocnemum cruciatum twigs of Halocnemum cruciatum with globular lateral branches The genus Halocnemum was first published in 1819 by Friedrich August Marschall von Bieberstein, at that time comprising two species, Halocnemum strobilaceum and Halocnemum caspicum (the latter is now a synonym of Halostachys belangeriana). Halocnemum strobilaceum was selected as the type species. During the 19th century further species were added, later these were grouped into other genera or treated just as synonyms of Halocnemum strobilaceum. For many years the genus Halocnemum has been regarded as monotypic. In 2008, the new species Halocnemum yurdakulolii was discovered, which was synonymized with Halocnemum cruciatum in 2012. According to Bacchetta et al. (2012) and Biondi et al. (2013), Halocnemum comprises two species: * Halocnemum strobilaceum (Pall.) M. Bieb.: a dwarf prostrate- ascendent shrub up to 60 cm, glaucous, with globular or cylindrical lateral branches and spikes, and more or less smooth seeds. Widely distributed in Eastern Europe (from Italy and Greece to Ukraine) and in Asia (Anatolia, Caucasus region, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Arabia, Kazakhstan, Siberia, Mongolia, western China). * Halocnemum cruciatum (Forssk.) Tod. (Syn. Halocnemum yurdakulolii Yaprak}, an upright shrub up to 1,5 m, pale yellowish- green, all lateral branches globular, and seeds papillose along the raphe (seed-edge). Distributed mainly at the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea: southern Spain and southern Italy (Sicily, Sardinia), Tunisia, Egypt, Libya (Cyrenaica), Cyprus, southern coast of Turkey, more rarely in inland (Sinai peninsula, Morocco, salt basins of the Sahara and the Saharo-Arabian area). Phylogenetic research confirmed, that Halocnemum is closely related to the genus Halostachys.  Uses  Halocnemum strobilaceum has small economic value as a grazing plant for camels and sheep. Plants are very good prime colonizers and are often used to rehabilitate pastures on highly saline soils. They are used as source of potash and as fuel by nomadic tribes.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The town of Chelsea grew up along the banks of the First Branch White River in central Orange County. It was settled in 1784 and became the county seat of Orange County in 1795. In the 19th century it developed as a regional service center for the neighboring rural communities, and also fostered modest industry, primarily small textile, grist, and sawmills, now mostly lost. Its greatest period of growth was between 1830 and 1850, with the result that much of its architecture is in the Greek Revival style popular during that period. with The village is laid out mainly north-south along what is now Vermont Route 113, but was in the 19th century a stagecoach route. Its central focus is a pair of town commons, separated from each other by Jail Brook and a strips of buildings lining the brook. The north common was established in 1794 as a public parade and militia training ground, while that to the south was given in 1804 as a site for the county courthouse. Arrayed around the common and along Main, Maple, and Jail Brook Streets are a fine collection of late Federal and Greek Revival buildings, mostly residential, although some commercial buildings survive from that period as well. Prominent buildings from this period include the courthouse (1847) and Congregational church (1848), both fine high-style Greek Revival buildings.

A number of bridges have also been constructed over the creek. Wild trout naturally reproduce within it, and forested blocks occur along the creek. Course Butler Creek begins on an unnamed pond on a hill in Jackson Township. It flows south for a short distance, entering a wetland where it turns east for a few tenths of a mile, entering another wetland and passing through Butler Lake. From the southern end of the lake, the creek flows south-southwest for several tenths of a mile before turning west for a short distance and then turning south-southwest again. After several tenths of a mile, it crosses Pennsylvania Route 492 before continuing south-southwest.

The elevation near the creek's source is above sea level. The surficial geology along Butler Creek near its mouth mainly consists of alluvium, although there is one patch of alluvial fan nearby. The sides of the valley are lined with a till known as Wisconsinan Till and there are some patches of bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale on nearby hills. Further upstream, the surficial geology along the creek continues to consist mainly of alluvium, but there are several patches of Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift nearby, as well as one small patch of alluvial fan. Wisconsinan Till continues to line the sides of the valley and bedrock is present on nearby hills. In the upper reaches, the surficial geology along the creek mainly includes Wisconsinan Till, but there are patches of alluvial fan, alluvium, and wetlands. At the headwaters, there is Butler Lake and patches of wetlands and peat bogs. In the Harford quadrangle, the alluvium in the valley of Butler Creek can be up to thick. The creek is separated from its tributary Little Butler Creek by two broad, low cols partially filled by till. The valley of Butler Creek in its upper reaches includes a \\"beaded valley\\" that was little affected by glacial erosion but considerably affected by glacial deposition, to the point that large amounts of glacial till partly or fully block off individual valleys. Along with Bell Creek and the West Branch Lackawanna River, the valley of Butler Creek is one of the best examples of such beaded valleys in the Thompson quadrangle.

History and recreation Butler Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1170794. By the 1870s, there was a village known as Burrow's Hollow in the vicinity of Butler Creek. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying T-548/Podunk Road over Butler Creek was built south of Harford in 1920 and repaired in 1982 and is long. Two prestressed box beam or girders bridges carrying Interstate 81 over the creek and T-582 were built in 1961 in Harford Township and are long. One was repaired in 1984 and the other in 2009. Another steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying T-548/Podunk Road over the creek was built in 1968 east of Harford and is long. A two-span concrete culvert bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 547 over the creek was built in Gibson Township in 1999 and is long. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying T-582/Penny Hill Road over the creek southeast of Harford was built in 2009 and is long. There are several boat docks on Butler Lake, a lake on Butler Creek. The Susquehanna County Natural Areas Inventory has recommended removing these and replacing them with a single boat launch in the lake's northeastern corner. Although there is recreational development pressure, the Susquehanna County Natural Areas Inventory also opposed flooding the bog with a dam. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in Butler Creek from its headwaters down to an unnamed tributary unofficially known as Gibson Creek, a distance of . The creek serves as a transition between cold headwater streams and larger, warmer creeks. Brook trout were observed in the creek in the 1930s. Butler Lake, a lake on Butler Creek, is listed on the Susquehanna County Natural Areas Inventory. The lake is a bog habitat, though there is some residential development along its shoreline. There is a large floating bog mat in the southern part of the lake. One of the largest forested blocks in Harford Township is situated along Butler Creek and its tributaries. It forms a \\"critical starting point\\" for riparian buffer conservation there. A block of forested land is also present along the creek in Gibson Township.

Description and history The Quechee Gorge Bridge is located on US 4, roughly midway between Woodstock and White River Junction, Vermont. It is set high above the Ottauquechee River near the southern end of Quechee Gorge, a major local tourist attraction that is part of Quechee State Park. It is a three-span steel deck truss structure, long, wide, and high carrying two lanes of traffic (one in each direction) and sidewalks on both sides. Its main span is a parabolic spandrel-braced Pratt truss, forming a span of . The arch is mounted on concrete footings, which are located near the stone abutments of the previous bridge. The bridge structure is built out of a series of panels and other steel elements, joined by rivets, and its deck consists of I-beam stringers covered by a concrete base. with The bridge was built in 1911, its trusses built by the American Bridge Company to a design by John W. Storrs, a prolific local bridge engineer. It was originally built as a railroad bridge, and was in 1933 adapted for use as a highway bridge; it is from that period that its current deck dates. It was probably built by cantilevering the arch ends over the gorge, braced by stay cables until the ends were joined. It is Vermont's oldest surviving steel arch bridge, and the only one that is spandrel-braced.

Toy forts come in many shapes and sizes; some are copies of existing historical structures, while others are imagined with specific elements to enable realistic play, such as moats, drawbridges, and battlements. Toy fort designs range from the ch√¢teaux of Europe to the stockade forts of the American wild west.  History  Toy forts and castles first appeared at the beginning of the nineteenth century in Germany, a country that dominated the world of toy manufacturing up until WW1. The earliest examples came as a set of generic wooden blocks which could be configured in many different ways. As time went on, some of these sets were designed to portray specific structures associated with real battles. Around 1850 dollhouse manufacturers started to apply their production methods and capabilities towards the production of toy forts and castles. Sets would consist of wooden components, some blocks and some flat, painted to depict details such as stone, brick, windows, arches and vegetation. The parts would be shipped in a box which was designed to be inverted and then used as the base for the toy fort. This design became the standard design for toy forts and castles for the next 100 years. The Germans dominated the toy fort market until about 1900 when other manufacturers from France, Denmark, Britain, and the USA started to appear on the scene. As technology progressed, new materials were used in the manufacturing of toy forts including tin, zinc alloy, composition, cardboard, hardboard, MDF, and finally plastics.  Manufacturers  The three best-known manufacturers of toy forts were Moritz Gottschalk (Germany), O. and M. Hausser (Germany), and Lines Bros. (Great Britain). = Germany = * Christian Hacker * _Moritz Gottschalk_ (1840‚Äî1905) started his career as a bookbinder, but by the age of 25 had branched off into children's toys which would eventually lead to him becoming one of the world's most influential toy makers of the late 19th to early 20th centuries. He started with the dollhouses that he is most famous for and quickly went from a cottage industry to running a factory. Once his infrastructure was in place he was able to diversify adding the manufacture of other toy buildings such as forts, stables, and grocery stores to his repertoire. * Dr. F.A.

Born in Rushall, then in Staffordshire, Dean began working at a lime pit at the age of ten. His father died two years later, he found work in Wednesbury to support the family. Around the age of eighteen, he joined the Primitive Methodists, and became interested in trade unionism, leading a branch at his local pit before, in 1887, becoming the first agent of the Pelsall District Miners' Association.John Saville, \\"Dean, Benjamin (1839-1910)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.I, pp.100-101 As the leading figure in the Pelsall Miners, Dean persuaded it to affiliate to the Midland Miners' Federation, and was rewarded with the post of treasurer of the federation. Through this role, he attended the first conference of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), and later served on the MFGB's executive committee on six occasions. He appears to have briefly served as secretary of the Midland Miners, but was consistently re-elected as secretary of the Pelsall Miners. However, from 1890, he no longer worked as a miner, instead running a tobacconist business in Walsall. In 1890, Dean was also elected to Walsall Town Council, serving as a Liberal-Labour member. He became the town's first working class magistrate in 1893, and served as mayor of the town in 1906. In 1907, he played little role in the dispute over MFGB affiliation to the Labour Party, but personally remained committed to the Liberals until his death in 1910.

It breeds in the winter on Guadalupe Island off the western coast of Mexico. It ranges south to the Gal√°pagos Islands. It is considered by some authorities to be a subspecies of the Leach's storm petrel. Taxonomy This species was first described as a subspecies of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa), by the United States marine ornithologist David Ainley. He distinguished it on grounds of physiology, morphology and voice, separating it from Townsend's storm petrel (Oceanodroma socorroensis) which breeds on the same islands in the summer whereas Oceanodroma cheimomnestes breeds in the winter. The species name cheimomnestes means \\"winter suitor\\", in reference to the fact that this bird breeds in the winter. There is still disagreement among authorities as to whether it should be regarded as a separate species. It is recognised as such by Avibase, but not by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Description Ainley's storm petrel is a medium-sized species about long, with fairly long wings with blunt points, and a moderately long, forked tail. The general colour is dark sooty-brown but from a distance this appears black; pre-moult adults may look more brownish when the plumage is worn. The rump is white, a U-shaped white patch having a central poorly defined dark area. The beak, legs and feet are black, and the feet do not extend beyond the tail in flight. Ecology This bird spends much time away from land over open ocean where its habits are likely to be similar to Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). During the breeding season it occurs on the waters off the Baja California Peninsula. It is only known to breed on three islets off the southern end of Guadalupe Island, Mexico. At the breeding colonies, this bird is nocturnal. It nests in crevices and burrows, and the total world population probably does not exceed a few thousand birds.

Biography Janet Arnold was born at Duncan House, Clifton Down Road in Bristol on 6 October 1932. Her father, Frederick Charles Arnold was an ironmonger, whilst her mother, Adeline Arnold, was a nurse. She was educated at The Red Maids' School and took a keen interest in clothes based on the school's uniform for orphans. Arnold went to study at West of England College of Art, where she achieved a National Diploma, before obtaining her art teacher's diploma from Bristol University in 1954. Arnold took on the role of lecturer at Hammersmith Day College in 1955 and remained there until 1962 when she moved to a senior lecturer role at Avery Hill College of Education, where she remained until 1970. In 1971, she took on a part-time role of research lecturer at West Surrey School of Art and Design. Arnold went on to start working with the department of drama and theatre studies at Royal Holloway College in 1978. Works Arnold's best known work was writing the books, Patterns of Fashion, vol. 1: 1660‚Äì1860 and Patterns of Fashion, vol. 2: 1860‚Äì1940. The two volumes include a large number of sewing patterns showing the change in fashion across the period, accurately drawn to scale. These books were regarded highly by museums, theatres, reenactment groups and students. She went on to write A Handbook of Costume in 1973, a comprehensive guide to research sources in the topic of costume study. She helped ensure the accuracy of costumes for film and television, as well as ensure that museums had accurate replicas of outfits. During the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Arnold worked on her opus Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd.

In 1981, she became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. She was presented the inaugural Sam Wanamaker Award in July 1998 with Mark Rylance. Arnold died of lymphoma at her home in London on 2 November 1998; she had been working on costumes for Theatre Royal, Bristol and Mermaid Theatre just two days earlier. The Society of Antiquaries of London set up a research grant in her honour, which makes annual grants to further in-depth study of the history of dress and the materials from which it is made. The Costume Society, which Arnold helped to found, gives out an annual award of ¬£500 in her memory to a student who has produced a reconstructed garment from one of her books.

It was introduced to the country by the British, with the first match played in 1863 and the first club formed in 1868, both in Yokohama. Until the 1980s, it was played almost exclusively by expatriates. The sport's governing body is the Japan Cricket Association (JCA), which was formed in 1984 and has been a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1989, initially as an affiliate member and then as an associate member from 2005. History The first cricket match in Japan was played on 25 June 1863. British merchants at the foreign settlement in Yokohama (a treaty port) challenged sailors on a Royal Navy ship to a game. The invitation was a ploy to ensure that the merchant community would be protected in the case of an ambush from local samurai, as they had been warned of a planned attack on that date. The participants in the match carried revolvers and rifles to ensure their safety, although no attack eventuated. The first cricket club in Japan was the Yokohama Cricket Club, which was formed in 1868 by a Scotsman, James Mollison.Michael Galbraith, \\"Death threats sparked Japan‚Äôs first cricket game\\", The Japan Times, 16 June 2013.

Retrieved 8 August 2016. However, in the 1980s, cricket was introduced into several universities, by Japanese students who had learned the game in other countries. The Japan Cricket Association (JCA) was formed in 1984, and became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1989, and an affiliate member of the International Women's Cricket Council (IWCC) in 1995.

The play offered a thinly veiled portrayal of Rattigan's own philandering father. Like Perchance to Dream, Ivor Novello's long-running musical terminating only two years previously, Rattigan chose a line from William Shakespeare for his title. The line is the first wistful question of a song passage in The Two Gentlemen of Verona.

A page of Amir Khusrow's riddles The Riddles of Amir Khusrow were developed during the royal courts of more than seven rulers of the Delhi Sultanate. During this time, Khusrow wrote not only many playful riddles, but songs and legends which have been a part of popular culture in South Asia ever since. Additionally, his riddles and songs and legends are considered to be an important early witness to the Hindustani language. His riddles in particular involve fun double entendre or, wordplay. Innumerable riddles by this poet are being passed through oral tradition for the past seven centuries with a notable increase in recent times. However, there is some debate about whether Khusrow was the real author of the riddle attributed to him.Annemarie Schimmel, Classical Urdu Literature from the Beginning to IqbƒÅl, A History of Indian Literature, 8 (Harrassowitz: Wiesbaden, 1975), p. 129. The collection contains 286 riddles, divided into six groups, 'apparently on the basis of the structure of the riddle and the structure of the answer'; 'these riddles are \\"in the style of the common people\\", but most scholars believe they were composed by Khusro'. The riddles are in MƒÅtrika metre. Examples One sequence of the riddles is posed as a dialogue between a woman describing some mundane phenomenon and an interlocutor who imagines she is talking about sex, asking 'Who, girl, your man?' For example:In the Bazaar of Love: The Selected Poetry of Amƒ´r Khusrau, trans. by Paul E. Losensky and Sunil Sharma (New Delhi: Penguin, 2011), p. 114 [nos 74-75]. He visits my town once a year.

He remained in the group as it became the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), but left in 1887 when the local branch dissolved due to a lack of members. Instead he became a leading figure in the Liverpool Socialist Society, and its secretary from 1889 until 1892, when it became part of the Fabian Society. He contested his first election in 1891, as an independent socialist with the support of the society, coming last in the contest for the School Board. In 1893, Reeves was a founder of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and from 1894 chaired its Liverpool District Federal Council. He continued to stand in every local election, now as an ILP candidate, but always without success. Despite this, he was not discouraged, and in 1895 left iron working to set up a newsagent business, believing this would allow him more time for his socialist activism. He also devoted much time to the Liverpool Trades Council, where he was seen as the leading figure in the socialist faction. Reeves became a dedicated supporter of the Labour Party, and in 1915 was co-opted to the West Derby Board of Guardians. He stood for Labour in Waterloo at the 1918 United Kingdom general election, but was not successful and only just held his deposit. In 1928, he contested his forty- second election, standing for Bootle Town Council, and he finally won a seat, which he held until his death two years later.

Teuber has represented Germany in four Summer Paralympic Games and is a multiple medal winner in both road and track disciplines. He has been named male German disability Sportsperson of the year on two occasions and is a Laureus World Sports Awards winner. Personal history Teuber was born in Tegernsee, Germany in 1968. In August 1987, at the age of 19, he was involved in a car accident in France. The injuries he sustained from that incident resulted in an incomplete paraplegia to the lumbar spine, and complete paralysis below the knee joint. He spent the three years after the accident in a wheelchair. Teuber was a nominee for the Laureus Award in 2003, 2004, 2008 and 2010. He was named German disability athlete of the year in both 2005 and 2009. He has been twice awarded the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Bay Leaf), in 2005 and 2008. He was appointed a Paralympic Ambassador in 2008 by Sir Philip Craven, head of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Teuber is married and has one daughter. Cycling career Ten years after his accident Teuber competed at his first Paracycling World Championship. In 1998 he took first place in the time trial event at the Road Race World Championship, his first major title. He qualified for the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, finishing sixth in the Road Race and 7th in the pursuit. Four years later Teuber experienced his most successful Paralympics, securing two gold medals at the 2004 Games in Athens, the Individual pursuit (LC 4) and the Time trial/Road race (LC4). His gold in the Individual Pursuit was almost lost when the day before the race one of his carbon orthoses, that supported his ankles, broke. With no spares it took two technicians working through the night to construct a replacement in time for him to compete. Success continued at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing with another two medals, this time a gold in the Road time trial (LC4) and a silver in the Individual pursuit (LC 4), losing to a world record breaking time by Italy's Paolo Vigano.

His political beginnings were characterized with a \\"battle\\" in newspapers such as L'√âtandar Tunisien and La voix du Tunisien, while defending Tunisia's integrity and the preservation of its national identity. Shocked by the 1930 International Eucharistic Congress of Carthage, Bourguiba and his mates decided to start a press campaign to denounce the event. They soon acquired an unprecedented popularity, and stood out from the elders of Destour. They attracted the hostility of settlers, eager to put an end to their activism and press campaign. However, Bourguiba and his friends founded their own newspaper, despite the colonial attempts to stop them. L'Action Tunisienne was thus created in order to defend the \\"little people\\" in a context of economic crisis, following the Great Depression. Bourguiba, worried about his country's state, knew that a good cause would revive the national movement, weakened by the 1926 repressions. In order to do so, he was the only one to defend M'hamed Chenik, a Tunis notable, who had been in trouble with the Residence, the French colonial administration. Bourguiba jumped at the chance to rally the bourgeoisie class to the nationalist cause. But his attempt failed and ended up dividing L'Action team. In this context, the uprising following the Tunisian naturalization issue, in early 1933, was the perfect opportunity for him. He started another successful press campaign. With his friends Tahar Sfar, Mahmoud El Materi, Bahri Guiga and his brother M'hamed, they sensitized lower classes to their cause and changed the Residence policy. The popularity he acquired during the event, led to his election as a member of the executive committee of the Destour, in May 1933. However, differences with the elders caused him to resign from the party in September 1933. First steps in politics = Challenging the protectorate = In the early 1930s, Bourguiba joined the Destour party, then the major political organization of the Tunisian national movement. He rose to its leadership along with Mahmoud El Materi, Bahri Guiga, Tahar Sfar and his brother M'hamed. As preparations took place to host French President Paul Doumer as part of the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the protectorate, nationalists were not pleased. In an article he wrote in Le Croissant, a newspaper managed by his cousin Abdelaziz El-Aroui, Bourguiba denounced the festivities as a \\"humiliating affront to the dignity of the Tunisian people to whom France recalls the loss of freedom and independence\\". Following these events, the Destour leadership gathered in an emergency meeting at the H√¥tel d'Orient in February 1931. It was decided to constitute a supporting committee for Chedly Khairallah's weekly newspaper, La Voix du Tunisien, which became a daily. The young nationalists joined the team and wrote critical analyses of the protectorate. Bourguiba, unlike his elders, dared to challenge the protectorate, publishing numerous articles and defining his own views on the colonial administration. He questioned both its effects and existence, writing: Portrait of Habib Bourguiba in the early 1930s La Voix du Tunisien became a very popular newspaper because of the originality with which Bourguiba, Sfar, Guiga and Materi addressed problems. They stood out from their Destour elders by their new ways of thinking. Bourguiba reckoned the end of the protectorate as the outcome of an evolution that had taken its roots in the very principles of French civilization, unlike Abdelaziz Th√¢albi, who thought of it as a breakup, in an article he wrote in La Tunisie martyre. Referred to as the \\"four musketeers\\", they were in favor of the intangibility of national personality and political sovereignty of the Tunisian people with a progressive emancipation of the country, while advocating for a nationalism that struggled against a regime and not a civilization. Their work soon attracted the interest of both public opinion and wealthy landowners and businessmen (preponderants) who had a strong influence on the colonial administration. Hostile to their daring plea, the preponderants wrote in La Tunisie fran√ßaise: \\"Mr Bourguiba proposes to transform the Destourian lament into a doctoral thesis in law. The claims are not modest [...] They must be demanded to tone down their Voix du Tunisien\\". During the conference he held in November 1973, Bourguiba related the events of his beginnings in journalism and the success of his articles: The preponderants were successful in their attempts to silence the nationalist papers as the colonial administration censored An-Nahdha, the daily paper of the reformist party and the weekly Ez- Zohra, on May 12, 1931. Within days, Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, Bahri Guiga, Salah Farhat and Mahmoud El Materi were sued. Chedli Khalledi, a member of the Destour party, alerted Marius Moutet and Gaston Bergery, chief of staff to √âdouard Herriot, who were friends of the nationalists and had influence in Paris. Bergery quickly interfered, contacted the head of the African-Orient department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and obtained an adjournment of their hearings to June 9, 1931. Awaiting trial, the editors of La Voix du Tunisien launched a press protest campaign whose tone was both violent and revolutionary. El Materi wrote: \\"When we started political action, we knew in advance what was awaiting us [...] May the hand that strikes me be heavy, may the judges that charge me be ruthless [...] A cause that does not engender martyrs is lost in advance.\\" On the day of trial, the streets that led to the court were full of people. Shops and stores of the medina quarter were closed and law enforcement could not handle the turmoil. The crowd carried them in triumph as their hearings were, once again, postponed. Fearing overthrow, Fran√ßois Manceron, then-resident-general, met with Chedly Khairallah, manager of La Voix du Tunisien, at his residence in La Marsa, to find a compromise. That very afternoon, he invited the drafting committee of the newspaper and declared that he had an interview, that morning, with Khairallah. He also announced that a compromise was found. This lie made mischief within the group. Bourguiba asked Khairallah for further clarifications and he confirmed the rendezvous with the resident-general. In response the drafting committee demanded the management of the daily journal but, upon Khairallah's refusal to do so, decided to leave the newspaper. = Founding of L'Action Tunisienne = After they left the newspaper, the La Voix du Tunisien team kept in touch and gathered sometimes in the Caf√© de la Kasbah or the Baghdad restaurant to discuss news and ideas, along with French and Tunisian socialist friends, such as the pharmacist Ali Bouhageb. During these meetings, the idea of creating a new newspaper was considered as they missed expressing their ideas. A drafting committee was formed that included Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, Bahri Guiga, Tahar Sfar, Mahmoud El Materi and Ali Bouhageb, who also managed the publishing firm. B√©chir Mehedhbi, a final year student, took charge of the editorial office. As for the newspaper headquarters, they were settled in the back of the Bouhageb pharmacy. In the midst of an economic crisis that mainly affected lower classes, L'Action Tunisienne published its first edition on November 1, 1932. Bourguiba, who studied public finance during his university studies of political science in Paris, devoted his first article to the budget, which he called the \\"Tunisian budget\\". He explained his idea writing: \\"I used to demonstrate that budget reflected the policy of the government and that it permitted to believe that the country was thrown into abyss.\\" Disappointed in the resigned moderation of their elders, the young nationalists defended lower classes. Bouhajeb devoted an entire section of the newspaper for this purpose, which he called La Voix du guenillard, while the other members of the drafting committee wrote in turn in their editorials. Fed information through documents provided by administration officials, they soon became famous among the public. Bourguiba, who was increasingly known for his work, socialized with Tunisois notables and went frequently to intellectual discussion circles where he met the Boulakbeche family. He proved himself to be clear and specific in his writings, which revealed a \\"talented polemist\\" with his strong legal arguments. He was committed to demonstrate the mechanism of colonial abuse from the effects to the causes, showing a great interest in social phenomenon, inviting workers and students to organize in order to defended themselves against abuse. He also insisted on the defence and safeguard of the Tunisian personality, writing:  Reviving the National movement  = The M'hamed Chenik case = In February 1933, a major fight within L'Action Tunisienne turned into a crisis, following the case of M'hamed Chenik, banker and chairman of the Tunisian Credit Union, which dominated the medina. In 1932, Chenik went to Paris as the vice-president of the Tunisian representatives of the Great Council, in order to alert the French government about the problems of indigenous agriculture. France decided to designate a committee chaired by Louis Tardy, manager of the National Agricultural Credit Fund, to investigate the situation in Tunisia. This move did not please the Residence which denounced the \\"convicted diligence\\" of Chenik. The colonial administration thus decided to seal his bank accounts. Despite this, there was no reaction in public opinion or among nationalists, even though the Tunisian members of the Great Council were collaborating with the protectorate. Only Bourguiba disapproved of the reaction of his friends, that he qualified as primary, writing: \\"I had there a first-hand witness who would give me weapons against the Protectorate and means to strengthen my position towards this regime. It was me who was winning in such a process. I did not care that some personalities improve their image at the same time.\\" Even though some people argued that Bourguiba acted out of personal interest, (he and his brother were tied to the bank by a loan), his aims were mainly related to reviving Tunisian nationalism. Chenik stated in an interview that any collaboration with France became impossible. Bourguiba saw in this case a victory that could rally the bourgeois class, considered to be collaborating with France, and unify the country around nationalism. He wrote: \\"We need to focus our attention on the event that had happened, on the argument which had been offered, so that we could widen our movement to important social classes of the nation, once indifferent or hostile to our program\\". Portrait of M'hamed Chenik To achieve his goal, he used \\"non-orthodox approaches\\". He went to L'Action headquarters to remove a critical part of his brother M'hamed, written in an article by Ali Bouhajeb, whom he did not inform. Bourguiba testified about his act in 1973 saying: Supported by Guiga and M'hedhbi, Bouhajeb judged Bourguiba's attitude and that of the journal in this case to be \\"unacceptable\\" before the three handed over their resignations. One of them later testified that: \\"Curiously, this excited Bourguiba. He was crushed because Bouhajeb and Mehedbi took care of all the material details, but he was a man of challenge.\\" Bourguiba then abandoned his lawyer's office and decided to manage the newspaper on his own. While the Great Council gathered to adjudicate on the agricultural budget, inspired by the recommendation of the Tardi committee, Bourguiba sent out a \\"supreme warning\\", writing: \\"We will be particularly inexorable against the last-minute setbacks or interested jilting.\\" His arrogance with the protectorate, and his determination to stand up to Chenik, was found to be impressive. When the draft budget favorable to French interests against which Chenik pronounced an indictment was rejected by the Great Council, Bourguiba wrote that: \\"The Tunisian people will remember that the delegates of the Jewish community were interested in the fate of our fellahs (farmers) much more than certain Muslim agricultural delegates of Center and South. The Tunisia we intend to free will not be a Tunisia for Muslims, for Jewish or for Christians. It will be the Tunisia of all those who, without distinction of religion or race, would like to accredit for their country and live under the protection of equal laws.\\" This statement will gradually become his doctrine, both modernist and secular., = The Tunisian naturalization issue =  Leading the press campaign  With the economic crisis that worsened day after day, and the rising popularity acquired by Bourguiba and his friends, a new generation of nationalist leaders emerged. Preoccupied, they reckoned a good cause would be sufficient to revive the national movement on a new basis. In this context, the Tunisian naturalization issue presented itself as a motive for the movement's renewal. During the 1920s, the nationalists protested in force against the enactment of the December 20, 1923, law which favored access by non-French protectorate inhabitants to French citizenship. According to the colonial power, they had, at the time, to face the increase judged to be \\"too fast\\" of the Italian colony compared to insufficient metropolitan immigration., Front page of L'Action Tunisienne on May 4, 1933, regarding the press campaign opposed to French naturalization. The hostility following the adoption of these measures receded gradually but resumed in the start of 1933. On December 31, 1932, upon the announcement of the death of a naturalized French Muslim living in Bizerte, Mohamed Chaabane, individuals gathered in the Muslim cemetery with the firm will to oppose the interment of the dead. They obtained the support of the city's mufti who delivered a fatwa affirming that as apostates naturalized can not be buried in Muslim cemeteries. Bourguiba decided to react and started a press campaign, led by L'Action Tunisienne and partially reprised by all the nationalist newspapers: \\"We then embarked on a major campaign to combat this thesis [naturalization] whose any consequence was to inevitably lead to francisation all the Tunisian people. Citing a verse of the Qur'an, we developed the argument that, by ceasing to be amenable to the Sharaa Court, the naturalized French ipso facto lost his Muslim attributes\\", he declared in 1973. Italy, fearing a major naturalization of its citizens, brought a discreet but active support to Bourguiba, decided to discredit the French initiatives and build a reputation. In order to stop the turmoil that worsened in the country every time a naturalized died, the Residence demanded a fatwa, in April, from the Sharaa Court of Tunis, the highest religious body of the protectorate. The Maliki and Hanafi sheikhs in charge of the case issued a sentence that solves nothing: They maintained the apostate status of a naturalized but said that if he repented, even verbally, before his death, burial in Muslim lands will be granted. This decision angered the nationalists while riots started in Kairouan and Tunis., Bourguiba denounced the duplicity of religious authorities, the provocations of the government, cast aspersions on naturalized and criticized the Destourian press whose \\"caution considered as the ultimate strategy seems overwhelmed\\". He invited the French people and Ahmad II Bey to intervene. Meanwhile, the Residence took a two-phased decision: Firstly, it yielded deciding that naturalized will be buried in special burial place, which appeared to be ghettos excluding them from the community. And secondly, Fran√ßois Manceron, resident-general at the time, enacted decrees judged \\"super-scoundrel\\" by Joachim Durel, granting him authority to imprison and arrest, at his will, any nationalist, also giving him the authority to suspend any newspaper or association \\"hostile to the Protectorate\\". Bourguiba commented this decision writing: \\"Repression comes too late. The atavistic fatalism of an oppressed people was shaken\\".  Rising popularity  Bourguiba's firm position increased his popularity among nationalists as he testified in 1973 saying: This victory led activists to request the convening of an extraordinary Destour. The event was held on May 12 and May 13, 1933, in Tunis at Mountain Street. Bourguiba made a speech criticizing the \\"outdated futile methods and the illusions of the leaders and their program that does not meet the aspirations of the people, who are therefore aware of his case\\". He also asked for \\"radical solutions, a tireless and energetic action unequivocally unnecessary or exclusively harmful to achieve independence within a union treaty with France, guaranteeing its legitimate interests and the interests of all the foreign colony.\\" He noted that: \\"In order to do so, we must form a front to unite all the trends of the great Tunisian Constitutional Liberal Party.\\" Successful in their press campaign, all of the L'Action Tunisienne team were elected unanimously as members of the executive committee of the Destour. At the time, Bourguiba and his friends of L'Action Tunisienne saw the Destour as lacking firmness. Nevertheless, it developed an organization with 90 local representatives from throughout the country. It had not grown since the arrival of Manceron at the head of the Residence. Recruiting among lower classes as well as the bourgeois classes, the new distinction among the Destour permitted them to have a strong position and influence the party in order to unify all factions of the nationalist front. Responding to the wishes of Bourguiba, many delegates supported this union. However, in 1933, it was not yet Bourguiba but Mahmoud El Materi who appeared to be the leader of L'Action group. This man who proved himself to be an active man of science in the French communist party and ended up as a delegate during the Tours Congress. He expressed his will not to become a politician. As far as he was concerned, tolerance, the sense of honour, solidarity, spirit, and justice overrode tactics, cynicism, provocation, and low blows. His qualities and charisma allowed him to forge a strong position within the Destour in which he was unanimous.  Break with the Destour  Meanwhile, the turmoil over the naturalization issue continued in Tunis with riots that started in the countryside, affected by famine. The nationalist press thus multiplied its criticism towards the Residence, which had decided to prohibit teachers and students from attending certain lessons. It also forbade the movement of officials and suspended nationalist newspapers, including L'Action Tunisienne on May 31. In addition, the Destour party was banned. The French government feeling that Manceron acted too late to stand firm, replaced him with Marcel Peyrouton, on July 29, 1933. In this repressive context, Bourguiba was deprived of his means of expression and was a prisoner of the Destour structure that was willing to take back his autonomy. Habib Bourguiba leading the protest delegation. On August 8, the opportunity to express himself was presented when incidents began in Monastir upon the forced interment in a Muslim cemetery of the son of a naturalized citizen. A fight erupted between the population and law enforcement, ending with one person dead and numerous injured. Bourguiba soon convinced Monastirian notables who were victims of police brutality, to choose him as their lawyer. On September 4, without informing the Destour of his initiative, Bourguiba led a protest delegation to the bey. They were welcomed by a man of confidence, who listened to their requests. Nevertheless, the party leadership, seeing in this the pretext to put a stop to activism that displeased them, decided to blame to the young nationalist: \\"It was he [Mahmoud El Materi] who announced me that a blame motion had been decided against me. I was outraged. Because my procedures at the head of this delegation protesting to the bey was not on the party's behalf, but on the behalf of a lawyer who intervened to defend his clients, all originating in Monastir, my birth city. Therefore, nothing justified this blame motion. My membership in the executive committee of the Destour should not prohibit me from other activity. Should it be so, there was no option left for me but to resign. Materi and the other members of L'Action Tunisienne wanted to do the same. But I dissuaded them, their presence in the executive committee could have been useful\\", he recalled years later. Bourguiba, who thought the Destour and its leadership to be obstacles to his ambitions, decided to resign from the party on September 9. He soon learned from this experience. The success obtained thanks to popular violent uprisings shows the failure of Destourians' favorite methods, consisting of petitions and telegrams. Only violence by determined groups could lead the Residence to step back and negotiate political solutions. That would be his guideline until 1956.

Grecescu was among the founders of research into floristics and phytogeography in Romania. He compiled a detailed inventory of Romania's flora, published in 1898 as Conspectul Florei Rom√¢niei. The book includes 2450 species and 550 varieties, with precise details as to geographic range, growth conditions and popular names; the morpho- physiological descriptions are completed by pedoclimatic notes. In the same text, he introduced innovations into the de Candolle system, as well as now- obsolete contributions to botanical taxonomy. He intensively explored certain natural reservations in Romania, publishing books about flora and vegetation in the Bucegi Mountains (1869, 1876); the surroundings of Agapia, VƒÉratec and Neam»õ monasteries (1879); the Gorj and Arge»ô Mountains (1895); the Suceava Massifs (1895); and the CeahlƒÉu Massif (1906).

He authored studies on the history of botany and on medical botany. As a thinker on biological phenomena, Grecescu was an adherent of the Pasteurian theory on the genesis of organisms, rejecting the notion of spontaneous generation. Regarding evolution, he was strongly influenced by the then-current ideas of Lamarckism and opposed to the creationist paradigm.

Born in Aspull Moor in Lancashire, Pickard worked at a colliery from an early age. He became active in the Wigan District Miners' Union and, despite being illiterate, he rose to prominence. He was elected as vice- president of Alexander Macdonald's Miners' National Association (MNA) at its founding conference in 1863, and as agent of the Wigan miners in 1864.Joyce Bellamy, \\"Pickard, William (1821-87)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.I, p.271 Pickard and Thomas Halliday became critical of Macdonald's cautious approach to trade unionism, and founded a new Amalgamated Association of Miners (AAM), with Pickard as treasurer. This new association advocated more militant action, including solidarity strikes, but continued to co-operate with the MNA, and even welcomed Macdonald to speak at its conferences.John Saville, \\"Halliday, Thomas (Tom) (1835-1919)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.III, pp.91-94 The AAM was initially successful, expanding across Great Britain and winning several strikes, which inspired Pickard to stand as a Liberal-Labour candidate in Wigan at the 1874 UK general election, taking fourth place of five candidates. The AAM was suffering from financial difficulties and so, in 1875, merged back into the MNA. Pickard thereafter withdrew from national trade unionism, but remained agent of the Wigan miners and was prominent in leading rescue efforts and organising compensation after mining accidents. After an explosion in Pearson and Knowles' Moss Pits in which 69 men died, the exploring party including Pickard descended into the downcast shaft where several colliers were found alive and returned to the surface. The coal had caught fire and two more explosions occurred and no more could be done. It was decided that anyone left underground must be dead and the shaft was sealed. . Pickard championed the formation of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Permanent Relief Society in 1872 after a spate of disasters caused great distress and hardship, leaving widows and families destitute. After Pickard's death, the Vicar of Ince related that he had been a witness at every House of Commons Committee from 1860 and given evidence at a Royal Commission. He was present in the aftermath of many of the mining disasters since 1858, only the senior inspector, Joseph Dickinson, had attended more, and frequently had been a member of the first exploring party that descended into the mines after explosions. He was delegated to attend inquiries after disasters in South Wales where he was held in great esteem. Twenty thousand miners contributed to the memorial for Pickard in Wigan Cemetery.

This is made up of representative elements linked to the ideas of Dominican liberators and at the same symbolism that contains the shield of the flag. The Square is used with many purpose like manifestation and the celebration of any national day like the Dominican Republic Independence Day.  History  The current Flag Square was built in 1978 during the government of Dr. Joaqu√≠n Balaguer as the center of a complex of public buildings including the headquarters of Ministry of Defense, the Central Electoral Board, the Institute for Price Stabilization (INESPRE), the Dominican Agrarian Institute (IAD) and the Center for Import and Investment, among others. In February 1997, President Leonel Fern√°ndez reopened the monument after having undergone a remodeling, and renamed Flag Square (Plaza de la Bandera), replacing Independence Square, as it was originally called. The design of the work was the responsibility of the architect Cristian Martinez and the engineer Andres Gomez Dubriel, who conceived the structure as a Latin cross, which can be clearly seen from the air, and in the center stood a replica of the Arc de Triomphe. On both sides of the arch they were placed two angels representing the glory and honor, and center, a sculpture symbolizing the motherland, holding the fallen soldier, made by sculptor Juan de √Åvalo. In this Plaza, the January 26, 1979, Pope John Paul II celebrated the first Mass of a Roman Pontiff, held in American land, projecting the square worldwide.

Dr. Maurice LeBauer, who practiced medicine in the Jefferson Standard Building and became chief of surgery at Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, was the son of Joe LeBauer, who moved his silk hosiery operation to Greensboro in 1920. He was married to Carolyn Weill LeBauer and died in 1996. In November 2012, the Community Foundation of Greater Greensboro announced a $10 million gift from the will of Carolyn LeBauer who wanted a new park in the city. On November 28, foundation president Walker Sanders announced a plan for Carolyn and Maurice LeBauer City Park as part of the performing arts center. It would be located on Summit Avenue between North Elm and North Davie Streets; Summit Avenue would be rerouted and would become Bellemeade Street. The site was the location of Festival Park, and a YMCA had once stood there. A steering committee started work in August 2013, and project coordinator Merrill McCarty said the 2.5-acre park, to be located on North Davie Street, would be \\"an anchor for the cultural campus\\", including the Greensboro Cultural Center, the Greensboro Historical Museum, and the Greensboro Public Library. McCarty said Carolyn LeBauer was \\"very specific about\\" including gardens. A groundbreaking was held November 19, 2014. The previous day, designer Nathan Elliott of The Office of James Burnett of Solana Beach, California showed what the park would look like. It included a playground, fountains, and a dog park. The Price/Bryan stage was to be moved next to the Greensboro Historical Museum, and a 17,000-square-foot lawn would be used for events or movies related to the performing arts center. A ribbon cutting on August 8, 2016 included a ceremony in Carolyn's Garden.

S. Army. Ballerino took the World Jr. Lightweight Championship against Steve \\"Kid\\" Sullivan on April 1, 1925, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a ten-round unanimous decision. The Jr. Lightweight class is now referred to as Super featherweight. Early career in Manila, Philippines with the U.S. Army Ballerino was born to an Italian family in Asbury Park, New Jersey, on April 10, 1901. At the age of seventeen he began boxing for the Army in the Philippines, where he was stationed, and according to one source won the bantam championship of the Orient in a 20-round match. Many of his bouts were never documented. At the age of 18, he would become known as a skilled bantamweight in Manila.He fought for the Army in \\"Carnival Canvas Man Once Made $400,000 as a Fighter\\", The Tennessean, Nashville, Tennessee, pg. 3, 20 September 1938 He is not remembered as a polished boxer with refined, scientific technique, but a relentless and determined fighter who thrilled audiences. He lacked a frequent record of knockouts and a strong punch, but he made up for it with enthusiasm and a relentless attack. A few sources state he began boxing as early as 1918 with the Army, but Ballerino's first known bout in the Philippines was in January 1920 against Kid Ponzo, which he won in a third-round knockout. Rising to face top-rated opponents quickly, he met future Filipino World Flyweight Champion Pancho Villa nine times between January 1920, and October 1921 losing to him in six bouts. Coming to the United States Leaving the Army in the Philippines in late 1921, Ballerino decided it was time to begin \\"boxing in earnest\\". He fought his first bout in the United States at the Eagles Athletic Club in Tacoma, Washington, on December 21, 1921, against Frankie Britt. Britt was a well-known American featherweight and later lightweight who would contend for the Pacific Coast Title in both these weight classes. Though the bout was a six-round draw, the crowd was thrilled with the pace of the fight and Ballerino's value as a future contender for the Jr. Lightweight Title was established. His primary opponent in the Philippines, Pancho Villa arrived in America to fight the following year, with the assistance of legendary manager and promoter Tex Rickard. Boxing management in Tacoma Ballerino was managed in his early career in Tacoma, Washington, by Eddie Tait, a former American featherweight boxer, who had briefly managed boxers and opened movie theaters in the Philippines where Ballerino had his start.Tait had managed boxers in Philippines in \\"Simonich Cleans Up\\", The Maui News, Wailuku, Maui, Hawaii, pg. 2, 3 March 1922 Early boxing career in Tacoma, Washington On May 18, 1922, he lost to Sammy Gordon in four rounds. The Seattle Star advertised the bout as a \\"Special Event\\", but for a boxer who was nearly local to Seattle, there was relatively little pre-fight publicity. The Junior Lightweight Class was in its infancy and its boxers did not attract the attention of boxers from more established weight classes. After taking the Jr. Lightweight Title, Ballerino would draw larger crowds, and greater coverage.\\"Harold Jones Will Be Real Test for Rivers\\", The Seattle Star, Seattle, Washington, pg. 11, 18 May 1922 He fought Mike DePinto on June 12 and 26, 1922 in Washington drawing in six and losing in four rounds respectively. DePinto was a skilled Italian lightweight a shade below the skill of a serious contender. Their June 12 bout was only a preliminary for a bout between Jimmy Sacco and Joe Gorman in Aberdeen. Ballerino would not make the top of boxing cards often until taking the championship, though near the end of his career he would fight a number of name boxers in front of larger audiences.\\"Boston Lightweight Will Meet Gorman\\", The Oregon Daily, Portland, Oregon, pg. 12, 12 June 1922 On October 25, 1922, he fought Seattle bantamweight Buddy Ridley at the Auditorium in Tacoma, in a bout that was pre-determined as a six-round draw at the insistence of Ballerino's manager Eddie Tait. The bout was a good draw, and spectators from Seattle flocked to Tacoma, as Balerino was \\"a rip snorting battler.\\" Leo Lassen of the Seattle Star noted that Ballerino \\"had always gone over big in every one of his scraps in the Northwest.\\"Seattle fans flocked to the bout in Lassen, Leo H., \\"Local Ring Fans Turn to Tacoma\\", The Seattle Star, Seattle, Washington, pg. 22, 20 October 1922 Ballerino's manager Eddie Tait had worked as a boxing matchmaker, and referee, and had once been a boxer in contention for the featherweight championship. Tait had managed a boxing club in Honolulu in 1908.Tait had been boxer and had managed boxing club in \\"Central Club the Latest\\", The Pacific Commercial Advertiser\\", Honolulu, Hawaii, pg. 3, 10 July 1908 Moving to Bayonne, New Jersey, from the West Coast He settled in Bayonne, New Jersey, the state of his birth, and set out to find worthy opponents. Shortly after his move to New Jersey, he impressively fought twice at New York's Madison Square Garden. On January 5, 1923, he met Frankie Jerome in a twelve-round draw and on January 19, he met Carl Tremaine in a second round loss by technical knockout. On June 18, 1923, he lost to Jewish lightweight Charley Goodman in a six-round points decision at the Polo Grounds in New York, a venue for well-attended, popular bouts. The fight was described as a \\"slugging match all the way.\\" \\"Pancho Villa, the Filipino Beats Game Jimmy Wilde\\", Altoona Tribune, Altoona, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 19 June 1923 On July 21, 1923, he gave an \\"artistic trimming\\" to boxer Joe O'Donnell in an eight-round win at Shetzline Ballpark in Philadelphia. One source noted that in his typical style, \\"Ballerino slammed Joe with nearly everything in sight, but the Gloucester blacksmith took his punishment without a whimper\\". The fight was a preliminary to an historic bout between his former opponent Pancho Villa and Kid Williams. Pancho Villa's feature fight received far more newspaper coverage.The bout was a prelim to Pancho Villa in \\"Williams Takes Terrific Beating\\", New Castle News, New Castle, Pennsylvania, pg. 16, 1 August 1923 After the move, he would find larger audiences, better known opponents, and more income boxing in New England and the Midwest where he primarily focused his career after January 1923.\\"Villa Wallops Williams Good\\", The Evening Journal, Wilmington, Delaware, pg. 12, 1 August 1923 =Boxing management in New York= He was managed by Frank Churchill from New York when he moved to Bayonne, New Jersey, and Mel Cooke, who was also a New York-based manager and promoter with boxing clubs in Brooklyn. Like his previous manager, Eddie Tait, Churchill had managed boxers in Manila and the Far East around 1920.Churchill managed Philippine boxers in \\"Orient to Take Up Boxing in Earnest\\", Chicago Eagle, Chicago, Illinois, pg. 2, 25 December 1920 Ramp up to the World Jr. Lightweight Title He first fought Steve \\"Kid\\" Sullivan, who would soon take the Jr. Lightweight Championship, on May 30, 1924, in Brooklyn, winning impressively in a twelve-round points decision. He fought Vincent \\"Pepper\\" Martin, an important opponent, for the first time in a non- title fight on June 24, 1924, winning in a twelve-round points decision at the Nostrand Athletic Club in Brooklyn, New York. Martin was considered a top New York based contender for the Jr. Lightweight Championship. =Steve \\"Kid\\" Sullivan takes Jr. Lightweight Title= Steve \\"Kid\\" Sullivan took the Jr. Lightweight Title on June 20, 1924, against champion Johnny Dundee. Still in line for a shot at the title, on July 15 and August 5, 1924, Ballerino fought Jr. Lightweight Championship contender Allentown Johnny Leonard in Brooklyn, New York, winning both non-title fights in 10 and 12 round points decisions. Fighting in Brooklyn again, on September 10, 1924, he beat Tony Vacarelli, another Jr. Lightweight Championship contender, in a ten-round points decision. =Ballerino's first World Jr. Lightweight Title bouts with Steve \\"Kid\\" Sullivan= Ballerino fought Sullivan, now the new World Jr. Lightweight Champion, on October 15, 1924, in a Jr. Lightweight Title fight in New York, losing in a fifth-round knockout in their first meeting. Taking and defending the World Jr. Lightweight Title Ballerino fought a Jr. Lightweight Championship against Steve \\"Kid\\" Sullivan on December 15, 1924, at the Auditorium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in a ten-round newspaper decision. In a World Jr. Lightweight rematch on April 1, 1925, Ballerino won a unanimous decision against his frequent rival Steve Sullivan at the Armory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a bout that went the full ten rounds. Several sources attribute Ballerino first taking the title from Sullivan at this bout, not his former bout with Sullivan in Milwaukee. One source wrote, \\"Ballerino took the lead at the opening of the fight and kept it up to the end, beating his foe in almost every round.\\" Both judges agreed that Sullivan took only the first and seventh rounds.Ballerino first took the title in this bout and lost only two rounds in \\"Ballerino is New Champion\\", The Evening Review, East Liverpool, Ohio, pg. 13, 2 April 1925 He fought a ten-round World Jr. Lightweight Title fight resulting in a No Contest with the highly rated Jewish lightweight Frankie Callahan of Brooklyn in Columbus, Ohio, on June 1, 1925. Ballerino risked the title if he could not last the full ten rounds with Callahan. On June 24, 1925, he retained his championship going ten full rounds to a draw with local boxer Babe Ruth in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the Phillies Baseball Park before 10,000 satisfied fans. The fight was close, but in his typically aggressive style Ballerino won enough rounds to prevent his loss of the title. as many as half the rounds may have gone to Ruth, but Ballerino landed many hard body shots throughout the bout, and managed to gain the victory.\\"Ballerino Still Jr. Lightweight Champ\\", Shamokin News-Dispatch, Shamokin, Pennsylvania, pg. 6, 20 June 1925 He successfully defended the title on July 6, 1925, against Vincent \\"Pepper\\" Martin in a fifteen-round unanimous decision at Queensborough Stadium in Queens, New York. Martin was recognized at the time as a top American Jr. Lightweight contender.\\"Tex Rickard Names High Ranking Boxers\\", The Palm Beach Post, West Palm Beach, Florida, pg. 11, 12 January 1925 =Losing the Jr. Lightweight Title one year later= Ballerino lost the Jr. Lightweight Title on December 2, 1925, in a ten-round technical knockout against Tod Morgan at Olympic Auditorium in Los, Angeles. Though putting up a typically aggressive and tireless display, the Lincoln Star wrote that Ballerino only won the first round decisively. He was down for a nine count in the third round, outpunched badly against the ropes in the sixth, and had the crowd shouting to end the bout by the ninth and tenth rounds.\\"Coast Scrapper Captures Crown\\", The Lincoln Star, Lincoln, Nebraska, pg. 16, 8 December 1925 The Associated Press wrote that Ballerino's seconds had his manager Frank Churchill threw in the towel, though they already knew Morgan had clinched the bout on points. Ballerino held the title nearly a year, a significant period in the competitive world of East Coast American boxing. Boxing after loss of the Jr. Lightweight Title Joe Glick After losing his title, Ballerino fought Allentown Johnny Leonard twice more on June 5 and July 21, 1926, in Queens, New York, and his hometown of Bayonne, New Jersey. He lost the June 5 bout on a ten-round points decision, but received a ten-round draw from his July 21 bout in Bayonne. On September 30, 1926, he fought highly rated boxer Eddie Lord at Nutmeg Stadium in New Haven, Connecticut, winning in a ten-round points decision. He fought Jewish boxer Joe Glick twice in November and December 1926 to ten-round draws in Brooklyn. Boxing decline and retirement On March 18, 1927, Ballerino began a five- match losing streak that ended with his last fight against Maxie Strub in Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania, on June 27, 1928. He lost to reigning World Featherweight Champion Benny Bass, in a fast ten-round points decision on October 17, 1927. \\"Bass, who was outweighed by seven pounds punched hard and accounted for a knockdown in the fourth round but Ballerino was up at the count of eight\\". Bass would take the World Junior Lightweight Championship from Tod Morgan in late 1929.\\"Benny Bass Defeats Mike Ballerino\\", The Brainerd Daily Dispatch, Brainerd, Minnesota, pg. 5, 18 October 1927 Getting out of boxing at the relatively early age of twenty-six was a wise choice for Ballerino, and not one every boxer was able to make. He had only five losses by knockout in his career, so he may have fared better than many champions who left the ring having suffered greater physical injury. By 1938, near the end of the Depression, he was taking down tents at the Tennessee State Fair as a \\"canvas\\" man. He claimed to have spent all of the approximately $400,000 he made during his boxing career, though he was proud of making his own way and said he had no regrets. He eventually retired to Tampa, Florida, where he died on April 4, 1965, at the relatively early age of 63. With 98 bouts to his credit, his prolific boxing schedule with many top-rated opponents may have contributed to a somewhat early death.

The term refers to the general rule that the law of a community was for the members of that community only, and that the stranger was without rights. Commercium was the chief of the private rights, which Latin cities had originally not only with Rome but with each other. If a foreigner had no treaty to the contrary with the city in which he or she entered, that foreigner could be seized and enslaved then their goods could be taken as bona vacantia (vacant goods, meaning things found without any apparent owner). Eventually a foreigner could rely upon the ius gentium (the right of the nations) in lieu of a treaty. Nevertheless, the bond of commercium meant more than this. It meant that the Latin was admitted to the Roman methods of acquiring property and of contracting obligations. In Ulpian's words \\"Commercium est emendi vendendique invicem ius\\" (Commerce is the right of buying and selling with each other) does not quite get across the actual definition of the right of commercium, therefore it must be taken as giving only a rough description of the term.

He wrote numerous papers on medical subjects as well as on natural history. His main interest was in palaeontology and especially the fossils of Calcaires de Caen. Lesauvage was born in Caen on October 23, 1778. His father Jean-Jacques Sauvage worked in the Bureau des Aides while his mother Marie-Louise-Jeanne Coquille ran a pottery and tobacco shop to add to the modest family income. Lesauvage spent his early years in a boarding school in a village near Caen where he was taken care of by an uncle. He was unhappy with school and was recalled due to his petulant behaviour and became an apprentice to a grocer at the age of fourteen or fifteen. He then moved to live in Rouen where he came to love books and reading returned and at the age of seventeen. He studied for a while under Delariviere and then under Doctor Dominel before going to Paris to study medicine. He won the first prize in Anatomy from 1806 to 1808 and obtained a doctorate in 1810. He returned to Caen and established himself as a skilled surgeon. In 1821 he was chosen to replace the medical head position occupied by Desbordeaux and vacated due to his death. The Caen Faculty of Science had to make a choice between Lesauvage and Eug√®ne Eudes-Deslongchamps and the Deslongchamps was chosen. Lesauvage then continued his surgical practice until 1846. After the death of Dr. Dominel in 1831 he was the head of surgery, a position he held till 1846. Lesauvage was a Professor at the l'√âcole secondaire de m√©decine, member of the Academy, correspondent of the Royal Academy of Medicine and the Academies at Rouen and Dijon. He left 12,000 Francs to the National Academy in Caen in 1884 to establish a biennial prize in physical sciences, natural and medical history. In 1827 Lesauvage became a member of the Soci√©t√© d'Agriculture and the Linnean Society. He founded a Medical Association in 1849. On 29 April 1844 he was made a member of the Legion d'Honour. He published works on the flora and the birds of Calvados. In 1838 he published a treatise on the treatment of syphilis. Works *Lesauvage, M. 1823. M√©moire sur un nouveau genre de Polypier fossile.

Meyer is an American politician, teacher, and attorney. A Michigan native and Wilmington, Delaware, resident, he was elected New Castle County Executive in 2016.  Early life and education  Meyer was born in Bay City, Michigan, and grew up in Wilmington, Delaware. He graduated from Wilmington Friends School, Brown University (cum laude in political science and computer science), and the University of Michigan Law School (member, Michigan Law Review).http://michiganlawreview.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/11/Vol.-100-Masthead.pdf  Career  Meyer taught public school in Washington, D.C., for three years. He also taught at Prestige Academy in Wilmington. He won a Skadden Fellowship upon graduation from law school and used it to work for Community Legal Aid in Wilmington. He then became an attorney working in mergers and acquisitions with Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett LLP. He served in Iraq as a diplomat for the U.S. State Department, worked as an economic advisor to Delaware Governor Jack Markell and was a partner at Potomac Law Group. He has started two businesses, Ecosandals and VituMob, both in Kenya. He appeared on CNN to discuss Ecosandals and on using technology to create jobs in poor neighborhoods. In 2003 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Meyer was awarded the Sam Beard Jefferson Award for the Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years and Under; at that same ceremony Condoleezza Rice received a Jefferson Award. Al Gore's Current TV called him an \\"all around super human.\\"  New Castle County Executive  = 2016 election = In the Democratic primary for New Castle County Executive, Meyer's campaign focused on integrity and economic policy. On September 13, Meyer defeated three-term incumbent Tom Gordon by a margin of 4.66% in the primary, winning 21,487 votes (52.33%) to Gordon's 19,678 votes (47.67%). Meyer defeated Republican Mark Blake in the general election in November with 67% of the vote. He took office on January 3, 2017. =2020 election = On September 15, Meyer earned the Democratic nomination for County Executive, defeating challenger Maggie Jones in the Democratic primary. Meyer won 43,833 votes (56.51%), while Jones received 33,735 votes (43.49%). = Tenure = Meyer has accomplished the following as New Castle County Executive: * Selected the first African-American police chief in the 106-year history of the 400-officer New Castle County Police Department. * Facing growing deficits, reduced spending by over $5 million in the first 60 days and passed a $284 million budget. * Announced, with the police chief, the kidnapping and safe release of a four-year-old girl and pleaded with the public to provide information to help identify a suspect. Several weeks later, using information provided by the public, announced an arrest. * Hosted first- ever county Iftar dinner for leaders of all the mosques in the county. * Proposed changes to contracting rules likely to save the county at least $2 million in annual construction spending and increase in-state apprenticeship opportunities. * Attracted Del Monte Foods to Glasgow, Delaware, and announced the global food producer was opening its largest distribution facility in the company, likely to create thousands of jobs. * Saved county taxpayers over $2 million by preserving hundreds of acres of county farmland at $3,000 per acre, cancelling a previous deal to preserve at $30,000 per acre. * Announced a new and comprehensive program to address over 1300 vacant homes. * Signed into law changes to the county's land use code to spawn job growth and innovation. *Partnered with private sector to provide NCC firemen with naloxone to address drug overdoses. *Selected the first African-American chief administrative officer for New Castle County. *Instituted mandatory employee trainings on sexual harassment and expanded employee training opportunities, including on implicit biases. *In response to rumors that a senior county police officer had sexually harassed female officers, took steps to enable any employee to file a grievance with Meyer directly; a female officer did so, and within hours the senior officer was under investigation and never worked another day as a County police officer. = COVID-19 response = Meyer helped New Castle County government form a partnership with Biobot, a company that analyzes sewage to estimate the number of people infected with Covid-19 in a given area. In a July 2020 editorial for The News Journal, Meyer advocated for sending all teachers and students back to school in the fall during the coronavirus pandemic.  Controversies  In June 2020, six current and former New Castle County employees filed a federal lawsuit against Meyer and other New Castle County officials alleging serial sexual harassment and assault by former New Castle County Police lieutenant colonel Quinton Watson. The lawsuit calls New Castle County government a ‚Äúsanctuary‚Äù for sexual harassers. In July 2020, Meyer faced allegations he made \\"belligerent\\" calls to two mayors who are supporting his opponent, Maggie Jones, in the 2020 Democratic primary for New Castle County Executive. Both Elsmere mayor Eric Scott Thompson and Newark mayor Jerry Clifton said Meyer's phone conversations with them were heated, and they felt the county executive made threats toward their communities by telling them that he \\"will remember this.\\" Meyer refused to specifically address the accusations.

He finds himself often challenging what has been considered a \\"working formula\\" for how to get \\"into the game\\" by neglecting the popular style and known formula for such, in favour of one that isn't very style specific, but rather what he wants and only what he wants to do.

It has since become internationally franchised under the English name Hawker Chan. Description Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle is a street food stall, one of over 6,000 such stalls within Singapore. It is owned and run by Chan Hon Meng, and has a signature dish of soy sauce chicken served with rice. On average it sells around 150 lunch chicken dishes each day; as of 2016, these dishes were priced at S$2. It is staffed by Chan and his two assistants. The stall itself is fairly typical for those in Singaporean hawker centres, featuring a neon sign and rows of hanging cooked chickens. Reception Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle became one of the first two street food stalls in the world to be awarded a Michelin Star, alongside Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle, gaining the recognition in the 2016 list for Singapore. This was the first time that Singapore had a Michelin Guide created for it. Chan hoped that the award would result in more young people entering similar businesses, as he has concerns about stalls being run by elderly chefs with no successors to inherit them. Following the announcement of the Michelin Star, the queues at the food stall have increased in length and a two-hour wait is not uncommon. Sales have also increased, from the previous average of 150 dishes per lunchtime to around 180. Chan said that he would not increase the prices of his dishes, saying \\"it‚Äôs not fair to raise them just because I won an award, in fact, my suppliers have increased prices four times in the last seven years and I‚Äôve not changed my prices at all.

It is owned and run by Tang Chay Seng. In 2016, it became one of the first two street food locations in the world to be awarded a star in the Michelin Guide. Description Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle is a street food stall, one of 6,000 such stalls within Singapore. It was founded in the 1930s by Tang Joon Teo, but after he fell ill during the 1960s, his second son Chay Seng took over its management. When Tang Joon Teo died in 1995, he left the stall to his three sons. Tang Chay Seng continues to run the stall, which was originally located at Hill Street, it moved in the 1990s to Marina Square and again in 2004 to Crawford Lane. The stall serves bak chor mee (minced meat noodles), with the noodle component tossed through black vinegar, chilli paste and other ingredients, a recipe created by Tang Joon Teo. There are other affiliated stalls within Singapore, with his brother Tang Chai Chye formerly running High Street Tai Wah. His two sons now run two separate stalls under that brand name. Tang Chay Seng's nephew, Arthur Tung Yang Wee, runs the Lau Dai Hua stall within Terminal 2 of Singapore Changi Airport. These stalls resulted in a legal claim in 2008 by Tang Chay Seng when Arthur Tung Yang Wee ran an advertisement saying that his stall had moved from the original location of Hill Street. This resulted in a loss of business for Tang Chay Seng, as some customers believed that it was his stall which had moved. Tang Chay Seng lost the case, but was awarded a sum as a goodwill gesture. Reception Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle became one of the first two street food stalls in the world to be awarded a Michelin Star, alongside Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle, gaining the recognition in the 2016 list for Singapore; this was the first time that Singapore had a Michelin Guide created for it.

Born in Torkington, Normansell was orphaned at an early age, and all his three siblings died while young, Normansell being brought up by his grandparents and an aunt. He became a surface worker at a coal mine at the age of seven, and moved to work underground when he was fourteen. When he married, at the age of twenty-two, he was illiterate, but his wife could read and write and persuaded him to learn.Joyce Bellamy and John Saville, \\"Normansell, John (1830-75)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.I, pp.255-257 Shortly after his marriage, Normansell moved to Derbyshire, then on to Silkstone in South Yorkshire, where in 1857 he was elected as checkweighman. This was unusual, as at most mines at the time, checkweighman was a position appointed by the owner. The following year, he was a founding member of the South Yorkshire Miners' Association (SYMA), which proved immediately successful. In 1863, Normansell fell into dispute with the owner of his mine, who sacked him, but the union supported him and, after seven months out of work, he won a court case for his reinstatement. A nineteen-week-long lock-out of miners in 1864 greatly weakened the SYMA, membership fell, and the union sought a new secretary. Normansell took up the post, working with his assistant, Philip Casey, and within ten years, membership had increased tenfold to more than 20,000. Normansell became a nationally prominent leader of the miners, attending the first few annual Trades Union Congresses, and organising an important annual miners' gala. He first stood for election to Barnsley Town Council as a Liberal-Labour representative in 1871, and was successful the following year, the first worker to win election to the council. From 1874, a recession led to a decline in the mining industry. Normansell recommended that SYMA members accepted wage reductions, which proved highly controversial. He was also accused of poor management of the union's finances, and decided to offer his resignation, but the union's executive convinced him to remain. He died at the end of the year, aged only 45.

Born in Ottawa, Hobin's often shocking and meticulously curated photos deal with \\"the darker aspects of childhood, storytelling and politics.\\" Hobin's work has received attention on an international stage, in particular his \\"In the Playroom\\" series and his work has achieved notoriety with audiences in Canada, the United States, Norway, Finland, Germany, and has been the subject of national and international debate with an audience of art critics, political movements, and the general public. The artist has recently been appointed as the Executive and Creative Director at the School of the Photographic Arts Ottawa. He is a part of collections owned by the Canada Council for the Arts, The Finnish Museum of Photography, the City of Ottawa, as well as having privately owned pieces in corporate and private collections all over the world. Early Career and Family History Great Great Grandson of Politician William Wallace Cory, Great Grandson of Hockey Hall of Famer Horace Merrill, and son of the prolific architect Barry J. Hobin, the artist's early career was in production design. Hobin was the Canadian production Designer for the first Slovenian/Canadian film coproduction created in 2010 titled The Maiden Danced to Death, a collaboration with Academy Award-winning cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. \\"Mother Goose\\" Series Hobin completed a BFA in Image Arts from Ryerson University in Toronto in 2003. His 2009 Mother Goose exhibit shown at the Dale Smith gallery (now closed) was first conceived of by the artist while at Ryerson and prefaced the haunting exploration of the darker side of nursery rhymes, in which Hobin explored what curator Johanna Mizgala describes as \\"fables and other cautionary tales that are told to children as a means of socialization and initiation into the conventions of acceptable, moral behaviour.\\" Hobin's work has consistently confronted the taboo the artist described as his \\"'love-hate relationship' with his childhood.\\" Hobin states that the series underlines the contrast between nursery rhymes' content which typically illustrates a \\"societal ill that has no obvious relationship to the starry-eyed innocence we often associate with childhood\\" \\"In The Playroom\\" Series In 2010, the artist returned to the provocatively staged images of child models but turned from the macabre of nursery rhymes to even more socio- politically charged topics. The artist photographed \\"a combination of professional child models who worked for free (to gain experience) or ... children of family friends.\\" As stated in the 2010 Macleans review, \\"[h]is topics are historic moments‚Äîmostly tragedies‚Äîimmortalized and saturated by media coverage. Goodbye Mother Goose.\\" The carefully crafted settings are populated by children who force to the fore tragedies like Lady Di's death, the 2004 tsunami, the murder of JonBenet Ramsey and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In her 2014 essay, Lisa Farley Associate Professor in the Faculty of Education at York University, describes the series as ushering in \\"the surprising return of what is both familiar and difficult to face within the self.\\" In a CNN interview on Hobin's work, Dr. Alvin Poussaint, professor of psychiatry and author at Harvard Medical University, advised that despite the perceived potential for trauma, the children involved seemed to treat the event like \\"halloween\\" or \\"playing make believe\\" and that children have \\"seen images of violence on the front page of the newspaper..so it's not like this is a first time for them.\\" Little Lady / Little Man \\"Reflecting on the death of a husband and wife through the use of a lullaby\\" these larger than life portraits of Hobin's grandparents at the end of their lives were described in Ottawa Magazine during their showing at Ottawa City Hall as \\"one of the best shows by a local artist to hit this city in the past year.\\" Art critic Paul Gessell goes on to compare Hobin to sculptural phenom Ron Mueck describing the portraits as \\"what Mueck would deliver if he decided to start photographing real people instead of creating them in his studio.\\" Gessell denounced criticism of the work as voyeuristic and characterized it unequivocally as \\"a work of love.\\" \\"Cry Babies\\" Series Hobin's \\"Cry Babies\\" series continued to tackle issues of social tragedy, but with a heightened focus on \\"social stigmas and racial stereotypes\\" which Canadian Art magazine deemed \\"content worthy of comment\\" while still remaining critical that the artist had not \\"fully considered the question of racial caricature, and particularly how it relates to his own social status as a white male\\". However, as with most balanced criticism of Hobin's work, the author concedes that while the work provides no comfort, it leads to interesting and necessary questions regarding race. The consensus, even among the most venomous critics, seems to be that the series merits consideration. Hobin has been transparent about the fact that he would prefer strong reactions, even negative, over indifference and told Global News of the Cry Babies series, \\"if I'm going in that polarized direction, I'm really hitting the mark.\\" Criticisms In a 2012 interview, CBC's q radio host Jian Ghomeshi described Hobin as \\"one of Canada's most polarizing visual artists.\\" In her criticisms of the series, Canadian Art reporter Emily Falvey damned the series stating \\"although In the Playroom (2010) often succeeded in outraging the conservative audience it seemed destined to annoy, in the final analysis it was no more disturbing than video games or Anne Geddes posters, and not as nuanced as other photographic projects tackling similar issues\\" Others deem the work a necessarily stark depiction of tragedies deserving of shock. In a 2010 interview, Vice Magazine quipped that \\"[s]ince \\"In the Playroom\\" is making a bunch of whiny babies upset\\" he connected with Hobin to discuss \\"the criticism he's received, the way kids absorb the news, how his entire series is a criticism of Western media, and whether or not we‚Äôre all giant kids playing adults.\\" In the 2015 publication \\"Art and Religion\\" by Aaron Rosen, Hobin is quoted stating that these news stories \\"have become our fairy tales...Play is how kids process information...And these pictures serve a purpose, as a moral, as a warming, just the way nursery rhymes did.\\" Grants and awards * 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 - Ontario Arts Council - Exhibition Assistance Grant * 2013, 2012 - Ottawa Art Gallery Auction - Critics Choice Award * 2012 ‚Äì Guatephoto Open Call Winner, Guatemala Photo Festival * 2012 - Corel Endowment for the Arts Award * 2012 - Magenta Foundation - Flash Forward Winner * 2011 - SNAP!

After winning a minor race on his debut he established himself as one of the best colts of his generation in Europe with an emphatic victory in the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud. In the following spring he sustained his first defeat when he finished second in the Prix Daru. His career was ended by a training injury a few weeks later. He stood as breeding stallion in Ireland and Japan with moderate results. Background Simbir was a chestnut horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his right hind leg, bred in the United Kingdom. During his racing career he was owned by Arpad Plesch and was trained in France by Fran√ßois Mathet. He was sired by Shantung, a French horse who finished an unlucky third in the 1959 Epsom Derby. As a breeding stallion he also sired the classic winners Ginevra and Full Dress. Simbir's dam Hevea won a handicap race over 1600 metres in France and became a successful broodmare, also producing Simbir's full-sister Saraca whose wins included the Prix Saint-Alary and the Prix Vermeille. She was descended from the British mare Phase, the ancestor of many major winners including Hethersett and Neasham Belle. Racing career =1972: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Simbir contested a maiden race over 1600 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse and won by two lengths from moderate opposition. At the same track on 13 November he was stepped up in class and distance for the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud over 2000 metres in which he was partnered by Bill Pyers. Ben Trovato started the 6/4 favourite after finishing a close second to Satingo in the Grand Crit√©rium with Simbir next in the betting on 4.6/1. The other fancied runners included Robertino (a half-brother to Roberto) and Valauris (runner-up in the Prix de Cond√©). Simbir began to make progress on the final turn, took the lead in the straight and won impressively by two and a half lengths from Robertino with a further two and a half lengths back to Ben Trovato in third place. =1973: three-year-old season= On 15 April at Longchamp, Simbir began his second season in the Prix Daru a race which serves as an early trial for the Prix du Jockey Club. Ridden by Henri Samani he started favourite but was overtaken and beaten a neck by Rose Laurel. Following a stewards' inquiry he was relegated to third for causing interference to the third-placed finisher Valuta. He was nevertheless aimed at the Prix du Jockey but sustained a split pastern in training and did not race again. Assessment In 1972 the independent Timeform organisation made Simbir the top-rated two-year-old colt in Eusrope. Although they named the British colt The Go-Between their best two-year-old colt on 129, they rated Simbir a pound higher on 130, level with the Prix Thomas Bryon winner Targowice and three pounds behind the filly Jacinth. In the official French Free Handicap he was rated the third best two-year-old of 1972, one pound behind Targowice and level with the Grand Crit√©rium winner Satingo. In their annual Racehorses of 1972, Timeform commented \\"of all the two-year-old colts of 1972, none appeals more as a prospective classic winner than Simbir\\". Stud record Simbir was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Ireland, beginning his stud career at the Grangewilliam Stud, Maynooth, County Kildare. He was exported to Japan in 1980 where he covered his last mares in 1982. He died on 28 October 1982. His progeny included Slaney Idol who won the Nijinsky Stakes in 1978 and the Supreme Novices' Hurdle two years later.

It is an endoparasitic nematophagous fungus that attacks nematodes and eelworms and is isolated commonly from field and agricultural soils as well as used as an experimental organism in the laboratory. History and taxonomy Harposporium anguillulae was described in the late 1800s as a parasite of nematodes. It has since been commonly reported in the literature. This fungus also traps eelworms. Harposporium anguillulae is one of 26 species in the genus Harposporium in the division Ascomycota. It is a pathogen of eelworms and nematodes, notable for its distinct sickle-shaped conidia that grow in pierce out through the host body. This genus Harposporium was treated initially in the Clavicipitaceae and is thought to be closely related to members of the genus, Tolypocladium. Both genera occur on nematodes and eelworms but rarely insects. The two genera can be differentiated morphologically, as members of the genus Tolypocladium produce more complex conidiophores with narrower conidiogenous cells. Growth and physiology The invasive apparatus of this species consists of non-adhesive, crescent-shaped conidia that are ingested by hosts and lodge in the esophagus or gut. The sickle shape of the conidia is also contributes to the ability of the fungus to pierce through the host cuticle. In the laboratory, cultures of the fungus can be cultivated on agar containing yeast hydrolysate or glucose, though growth is much slower on glucose. The fungus grows rapidly on water-agar and produces chlamydospores, implying an oligotrophic physiology. Habitat and ecology Nematophagous fungi occur in a variety of habitats including leaves entering the decomposition phase, soil samples that contain decomposed leaves or in soil samples from agricultural land and they can also be found in pasture land. The latter possibly relates to the tendency of this species to occur in dung of cow and sheep where its nematode hosts are abundant. The fungus is commonly found in tropical and warm climates. It is more commonly encountered in the spring and fall. The fungus has been isolated from include Brazil, China, Florida, New Zealand, and eastern Canada. The fungus tends to be more commonly reported from climate regions subject to monsoons and does not appear to survive cold weather well, though the predilection of this species for warm damp climates may relate more to the distributions of its hosts. The fungus is known primarily as a parasite of nematodes and eelworms. During its life cycle, conidia of the fungus are ingested by eelworms or nematodes and lodge in the pharnyx or gut. Once inside the host, the conidia germinate and begin to colonize the host digestive tract. During the initial phases of this process, the host remains alive, but as the fungus spreads from the gut to the surrounding tissues in the latter stages of infection and the death of the host soon follows. Conidial production occurs on nematode cadavers by the eruption of conidiophores and conidia through the host cuticle. Biological control of nematodes This fungus has been investigated as a biocontrol agent of agriculturally important nematodes, most notably those responsible for gastrointestinal infection of grazing animals. These parasitic infections are commonly treated with anthelmintic agents including benimidazole, levamisole and invermectin. However, increasing levels of anthelmintic resistant have been observed, driving the search for new treatment and prevention options. Larvae of animal pathogenic nematodes are found in soil. The prospect of treating contaminated soils with nematode pathogenic fungi such as H. anguillulae has show potential to reduce nematode populations. However, the fungus does not persist in soil following the elimination of nematode populations, potentially limiting its use as a sustainable biocontrol agent.

Wright (October 24, 1873 ‚Äì June 4, 1928) was a teacher and electrician. While working for Portland General Electric, he designed the electrical lighting for the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon.  Early life  Wright was born on October 24, 1873 to George and Eliza Wright. He had two older siblings, Jane and Samuel Wright, and was raised on a dairy farm in northern Iowa, near Fort Dodge. At the age of 17, Wright traveled to Portland, Oregon to experience life in the West. Upon arriving in Portland, Wright worked odd jobs: building houses, loading and unloading ships at the Port of Portland, and teaching in the Portland Schoolhouse for 6 months from 1892. On February 21, 1893, the following opinion article was published in the Oregonian newspaper: > Thomas Wright has brought new inspiration to the education system. [...] In > addition to the required English and Mathematics courses, he has provided a > refreshing addition of Practical skills, most notably Construction. He is a > firm believer of the \\"hands-on\\" method of instruction, and has taken his > classes on a number of botanical field-trips, most centered around the > discovery of edible plants.  Lewis and Clark Exposition  Illuminated Fairgrounds at the Centennial Exposition, designed by Thomas H. Wright In 1893, Wright was hired in the Portland General Electric's new City-Eastside Electric Light Plant. In 1904, as preparations for the Lewis and Clark exposition were underway, Wright advised Portland General Electric to consider lighting the fairgrounds, which would give it a greater standing in the eyes of Portland and the world. The company was not well respected by major eastern stockholders, which had limited its growth, and would need greater funding if it was to build another generator to power the fairgrounds. Henry H. Goode, the president of Portland General Electric, traveled to New York in the spring of 1905, so stockholders would invest a total of three thousand dollars to build a new plant. Wright, meanwhile, was put in charge of designing the electrical plans for the fairgrounds. When Goode returned confirming that the money was available, construction began on Wright's plans. Many of the lighting technologies of the World's fair had never been implemented in such a scale before the fair, including the incandescent lights around Guild's Lake and the Forestry Building, and large searchlights on top of the fair's Government building.  Later life  After the fair, Wright continued to work as an electrician. On June 2, 1928, Wright fractured his skull, after falling while repairing electrical cables. He died two days later, in Portland Oregon, and was buried in Lone Fir Cemetery.  Legacy  In the book Bringing Power to Ideas, the Portland General Electric Company recognized the influence that Wright had had on their company's continued prosperity throughout the twentieth century.

Olympic karate will feature two types of events: Kumite and Kata. Sixty competitors from around the world will compete in the Kumite competition, and twenty will compete in the Kata competition. Both divisions of the competition will be split 50/50 between men and women. Background The quest to bring karate to the Olympics was begun in the 1970s by Jacques Delcourt.\\"Karate in the Olympics? More than a pipe dream\\". Coleman, J. (1993): \\"Watch out, WUKO‚ÄîHere comes Shotokan Karate's Nishiyama! Noted Instructor claims he is ready to lead Olympic Karate movement if IOC ousts WUKO.\\" Black Belt, 31(4):18‚Äì22. In 2009, in the 121st International Olympic Committee voting, karate did not receive the necessary two-thirds majority vote to become an Olympic sport. Karate was being considered for the 2020 Olympics,however at a meeting of the IOC's executive board, held in Russia on May 29, 2013, it was decided that karate (along with wushu and several non-martial arts) would not be considered for inclusion in 2020 at the IOC's 125th session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in September 2013. Bid for inclusion In September 2015, karate was included in a shortlist along with baseball, softball, skateboarding, surfing, and sport climbing to be considered for inclusion in the 2020 Summer Olympics; and in June 2016, the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that they would support the proposal to include all of the shortlisted sports in the 2020 Games. Finally, on August 3, 2016, all five sports (counting baseball and softball together as one sport) were approved for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic program. Format and rules The Olympic karate competition will put eight gold medals in dispute: six for the Kumite (fight) competition (with three weight categories for each sex) and two for the Kata (form) competition (one for each sex). The main rules for Kumite and Kata competitions are as follows: =Kumite= The individual tournament for the Kumite competition at the World Karate Federation (WKF) Karate World Championships is held under a weight class system comprising five divisions each for both men and women. However, the Kumite competition at the Summer Olympics will consist of just three divisions each, thus: *Weight classes for men: ‚àí67 kg, ‚àí75 kg, +75 kg *Weight classes for women: ‚àí55 kg, ‚àí61 kg, +61 kg Kumite rules In any category, fights last for up to three timed minutes (i.e. the clock stops every time the referee says yame). During that period, the winner is considered to be the karateka who scores eight points more than their adversary. If this does not happen, the person with more points at the end of the fight is the winner. If the fight ends up tied, a decision will be given through the senshu rule, the contestant that scored the first unopposed point wins. Assignment of points Points are earned as follows: *Ippon (three points): for hitting the head or neck of the opponent with a kick, or when any technique is applied to a fallen adversary. *Waza-ari (two points): for applying a kick to the belly, side, back or torso of the opponent. *Yuko (one point): for delivering a punch with closed hand (tsuki) to the head, neck, belly, side, back or torso of the opponent. Strikes below the belt are strictly forbidden and strength must always be controlled as the fighter will receive a warning if they hurt their opponent, points may be lost or there may even be a disqualification if the resulting injury is severe. Knocking an opponent down to the floor without at least attempting to strike him/her is also liable to be punished. Warning levels: *Chukoku (first warning): for committing a minor infraction for the first time. As this is only the first warning, points are not awarded to the adversary. *Keikoku (second warning): for the same minor infraction, or for committing a medium infraction for the first time. One point is awarded to the adversary. *Hansoku-chui (third warning): for committing the same minor infraction for the third time, the same medium infraction for a second time, or for committing a major infraction for the first time (usually excessive contact to vital parts or below the belt, really hurting the opponent). The victory is given to the opponent. *Hansoku (fourth and final warning): this not only gives victory to the opponent but makes it an 8‚àí0 victory, inflicting serious damage on the team score as a whole. Warnings and punishments are divided into two different categories, the first being for excessive and/or illegal contact and the other for technical violations, such as leaving the koto (fighting space) or faking an injury in order to make the referee give the opponent a warning. =Kata= Competitors are judged on the power and correctness of their techniques. Under conventional competition rules, one competitor is assigned a blue belt and the other a red belt, and each takes a turn in demonstrating his or her kata. The outcome of the competition is determined under a flag system, where five judges who each have a blue flag and a red flag raise either to signal which competitor, they believe, won: the one with more flags raised in his or her favour is declared the winner. However discussions are still ongoing into the judging system, including whether to use a scoring system rather than the flag system. Due to the immense number of karate styles, each with its own katas, only katas from the styles recognized by the WKF (G≈çj≈´-ry≈´, Shit≈ç-ry≈´, Shotokan and Wad≈ç-ry≈´Kata and Kumite Competition Rules, on the WKF website) are allowed in the Olympics. The lack of representation of many karate styles in the kata competition generates much criticism from practitioners of these styles around the globe.

In 1988, bowing to some alumni concerns, the school's original name was restored.

It was built in around 1540, but it was deconsecrated in 1644, being converted into an ancillary building for the nearby Santa Cecilia Tower. The only surviving medieval chapel on Gozo, it was severely damaged in an arson attack in 2007 and a partial collapse in 2008. The chapel was then passed to the NGO Wirt Gƒßawdex, who restored it between 2008 and 2011. Since its inauguration in 2012, the restored chapel is open to the public once every month. History The nearby Santa Cecilia Tower, which was built in 1613 The date of construction of the Santa Cecilia Chapel is unknown, but it is believed to date back to around 1540. The area around the chapel was referred to as Santa Cecilie del Mugiarro or in variants of that name in notarial documents dated 1424 and 1569. The surrounding area is still known as ta' Santa ƒäeƒãilja or ta' Santa ƒäilja. The oldest recorded reference to the building itself was made in a pastoral visit by Bishop Baldassare Cagliares in 1615. In 1613, the knight Fra Bernardo Macedonia built a tower nearby and it was called the Santa Cecilia Tower after the chapel. The chapel was described as being in good condition in 1630, and it was maintained through donations in the next few years. However, it was in a bad state by 1635, and it was deconsecrated in 1644. The chapel became an ancillary building to the tower, at times probably housing a mule-driven mill. The chapel (along with the tower) was scheduled as a Grade 1 monument in 1996, and it was expropriated by the government in 1997, although the order was not executed due to a compensation issue and the chapel remained in use as an animal shelter and a store until the early 21st century. Its interior was burnt down by vandals in August 2007, causing irreparable damage in the process. Part of the west wall and some roof slabs collapsed after heavy rainfall in January 2008. Plinth with a plaque commemorating the inauguration of the restored chapel in 2012 Emergency stabilization works were carried out after the 2008 collapse, and later that year the chapel was entrusted to the NGO Wirt Gƒßawdex. Restoration continued until 2011, and it was inaugurated on 24 March 2012. The restoration works were carried out by Wirt Gƒßawdex and the Ministry for Gozo and were sponsored by the Baron Group of Companies, with additional funds coming through eco-gozo projects and The Rotary Club Gozo. The chapel was converted into a venue for cultural activities including lectures, exhibitions and concerts. The chapel remains under the care of Wirt Gƒßawdex, and it is open to the public free of charge on the last Saturday of every month from 11:00 to 13:00. Group visits can be arranged by appointment. The chapel is now also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture The Santa Cecilia Chapel as viewed from the rear, with Santa Cecilia Tower at far The Santa Cecilia Chapel has a simple design, and it is a typical example of Maltese vernacular architecture from the late medieval period. It is the best preserved unaisled chapel in Malta, which were once common throughout the islands. It is the only surviving medieval chapel in Gozo. The building has an almost perfect square plan, measuring , having a slight pitch on the roof. The chapel is constructed out of local limestone, with the fa√ßade being constructed out of ashlar blocks while the other sides are built out of rubble stonework. The chapel's floor is about below ground level, so it is led to by three steps. The interior is divided into four bays by three stone arches, which support the building's roof. A small window above the door is the only source of natural light in the chapel, apart from the doorway.

He held royal offices firstly in the county of his birth, and later in the west country, particularly Devon and Dorset, and has been called 'one of the wealthiest commoners in England' of the period.Jacob, E.F., Essays in Medieval History (Manchester, 1968), 36. Early life and career Humphrey Stafford was born some time after 1341, the eldest son of Sir John Stafford of Amblecote and his second wife, Margaret Stafford (a daughter of Ralph, 1st Earl of Stafford, a distant relation). Ralph Stafford was his brother. His first official positions ranged from tax assessor for Wiltshire (1379), JP for the same county a year later, Sheriff of Staffordshire (1383‚Äì4), and Member of Parliament for Warwickshire during the October 1383 parliament. Prior to his long parliamentary career, he was primarily a soldier of the crown, generally retained in the armies of the Earls of Stafford, campaigning in France (in 1359), Ireland (1361), and Flanders (1373). Family Stafford married twice. In 1365 he married Alice Greville (born 1345) of Southwick, Wiltshire, who at the time was a ward of Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford, and brought Stafford estates in Warwickshire. His second marriage, around 1387, to Elizabeth d'Aumarle ( 1345 ‚Äì 1413) (daughter of William d'Aumarle) gave him those lands in the south-west which formed his later power-base, and allowed him to stand for the Dorset parliamentary constituency for the subsequent twelve parliaments. His second wife also brought him Sir William Bonville of Shute (died 1408) as a brother-in-law. Elizabeth d'Aumarle also married John Maultravers (c. 1342 ‚Äì 1386) of Hooke, Dorset. Later career In 1388, Humphrey Stafford was eventually caught up in the crisis of the Lords Appellant, being required by them to take oaths of loyalty to the regime in Dorset. It was at this time ‚Äì in a possibly related incident ‚Äì that members of the Cornish gentry conspired to assassinate him, eventually managing to shoot him 'with a certain engine called a \\"gunne\\" so that his life was despaired of.' However, since at the same time he loaned King Richard II 100 marks, and later received a royal appointment to assess the Appellants' forfeited lands there, the king clearly did not see Stafford as a major player in the rebellion locally. Following Richard II's deposition by Henry Bollingbroke in 1399, Stafford does not seem to have lost royal favour by his previous support for the old king; indeed, within a few weeks of Henry's coronation he was referred to as a 'King's Knight' and was granted the royal manor of Seavington, Somerset. By now Stafford was, in E.F. Jacob's words, 'a shire knight of standing and influence,'Jacob, E.F., Essays in Medieval History (Manchester, 1968), 35. and of all the gentry in the county, Humphrey was 'at their head for wealth.'McFarlane, K.B., England in the Fifteenth Century (London, 1981), 14. His estates were valued in the 1412 tax assessment at around ¬£570 per annum.Roskell, J.S., The Commons in the Parliament of 1422: English Society and Parliamentary Representation Under the Lancastrians (Manchester, 1954), 80. Death Stafford died on 31 October 1413. In his will he left, among other things, his household servants one pound each; to his grooms, 6s.8d. apiece; and to his pages, half that amount. The majority of his bequests were to ecclesiastic institutions: over ¬£23 to Westminster Abbey, ¬£20 to the Benedictine Abbey in Abbotsbury, and ¬£8 for two-years' worth of masses for Stafford's soul. His wife had died two weeks previously. His heir was Sir Humphrey Stafford (died 1442). Stafford also left an illegitimate son, John, by one Emma, of North Bradley; he was the subject of a Papal dispensation in 1408, rose through the ranks of the Roman Catholic Church, and eventually became Bishop of Bath and Wells, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Chancellor of England.

Further south, the Cuinarana Marine Extractive Reserve lies to the west on the opposite shore of the Cuinarana River. The Chocoar√© - Mato Grosso Extractive Reserve is to the south, higher up the Maracan√£ River. It adjoins the Algodoal-Maiandeua Environmental Protection Area to the north. History The Maracan√£ Marine Extractive Reserve was created by decree on 13 December 2002 with the objectives of ensuring the sustainable use and conservation of renewable natural resources, while protecting the livelihoods and culture of the local extractive population. The reserve is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). On 22 June 2005 the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform) recognised the reserve as supporting 1,000 families of small rural producers, allowing them to participate in PRONAF. On 30 October 2008 the environment ministry authorised a research project by the Museu Paraense Em√≠lio Goeldi entitled \\"Ethnobotany in the fishing community of Vila da Penha (Maracan√£ Marine Extractive Reserve): Knowing and Valuing\\". The deliberative council was created on 29 July 2009. Administrative responsibility was transferred to the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) on 22 March 2010. On 23 March 2010 ICMBio granted the right to use the reserve to the Association of Users of the Maracan√£ Marine Extractive Reserve. The reserve is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Environment The climate is Amazon equatorial, with annual rainfall of about . Temperatures range from and average . The terrain is flat, with poorly drained clay soil that is flooded by the tides all year. Altitudes range from above sea level. The reserve protects a typical coastal mangrove ecosystem with trees of the genera Rhizophora, Avicennia and Laguncularia. In the fringe along the left side of Maracan√£ Bay there are mainly Laguncularia racemosa, followed by Avicennia germinans and Avicennia schaueriana, with a few Rhizophora mangle further inland. The terra firma forest mainly consists of capoeiras. Birds include white heron, sandpipers and hawks. Crustaceans include crabs, molluscs, oysters and mussels.

Most of the industry is focused on animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs, produced in cell culture rather than raising and slaughtering farmed livestock. The most well known cellular agriculture concept is cultured meat.  History  Although cellular agriculture is a nascent scientific discipline, cellular agriculture products were first commercialized in the early 20th century with insulin and rennet. On March 24, 1990, the FDA approved a bacteria that had been genetically engineered to produce rennet, making it the first genetically engineered product for food. Rennet is a mixture of enzymes that turns milk into curds and whey in cheese making. Traditionally, rennet is extracted from the inner lining of the fourth stomach of calves. Today, cheese making processes use rennet enzymes from genetically engineered bacteria, fungi, or yeasts because they are unadulterated, more consistent, and less expensive than animal-derived rennet. In 2004, Jason Matheny founded New Harvest, whose mission is to \\"accelerate breakthroughs in cellular agriculture.\\" New Harvest is the only organization focused exclusively on advancing the field of cellular agriculture and provided the first PhD funding specifically for cellular agriculture, at Tufts University. By 2014, IndieBio, a synthetic biology accelerator in San Francisco, has incubated several cellular agriculture startups, hosting Muufri (making milk from cell culture, now Perfect Day Foods), Clara Foods (making egg whites from cell culture), Gelzen (making gelatin from bacteria and yeast, now Geltor), Afineur (making cultured coffee beans) and Pembient (making rhino horn). Muufri and Clara Foods were both initially sponsored by New Harvest. In 2015, Mercy for Animals created The Good Food Institute, which promotes plant- based and cellular agriculture. On July 13, 2016, New Harvest hosted the world's first international conference on cellular agriculture in San Francisco, California. The day after the conference, New Harvest hosted the first closed-door workshop for industry, academic, and government stakeholders in cellular agriculture.  Research tools  Several key research tools are at the foundation of research in cellular agriculture. These include: = Cell lines = A fundamental missing piece in the advancement of cultured meat is the availability of the appropriate cellular materials. While some methods and protocols from human and mouse cell culture may apply to agricultural cellular materials, it has become clear that most do not. This is evidenced by the fact that established protocols for creating human and mouse embryonic stem cells have not succeeded in establishing ungulate embryonic stem cell lines. The ideal criteria for cell lines for the purpose of cultured meat production include immortality, high proliferative ability, surface independence, serum independence, and tissue-forming ability. The specific cell types most suitable for cellular agriculture are likely to differ from species to species. = Growth media = Conventional methods for growing animal tissue in culture involves the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS). FBS is a blood product extracted from fetal calves. This product supplies cells with nutrients and stimulating growth factors, but is unsustainable and resource- heavy to produce, with large batch-to-batch variation. Cultured meat companies have been putting significant resources into alternative growth media. After the creation of the cell lines, efforts to remove serum from the growth media are key to the advancement of cellular agriculture as fetal bovine serum has been the target of most criticisms of cellular agriculture and cultured meat production. It is likely that two different media formulations will be required for each cell type: a proliferation media, for growth, and a differentiation media, for maturation. = Scaling technologies = As biotechnological processes are scaled, experiments start to become increasingly expensive, as bioreactors of increasing volume will have to be created. Each increase in size will require a re-optimization of various parameters such as unit operations, fluid dynamics, mass transfer, and reaction kinetics. = Scaffold materials = For cells to form tissue, it is helpful for a material scaffold to be added to provide structure. Scaffolds are crucial for cells to form tissues larger than 100 ¬µm across. An ideal scaffold must be non-toxic for the cells, edible, and allow for the flow of nutrients and oxygen. It must also be cheap and easy to produce on a large scale without the need for animals. = 3D tissue systems = The final phase for creating cultured meat involves bringing together all the previous pieces of research to create large (>100 ¬µm in diameter) pieces of tissue that can be made of mass-produced cells without the need for serum, where the scaffold is suitable for cells and humans.  Applications  While the majority of discussion has been around food applications, particular cultured meat, cellular agriculture can be used to create any kind of agricultural product, including those that never involved animals to begin with, like Ginkgo Biowork's fragrances. = Meat = *Impossible Foods *:The Impossible Burger produced by Impossible Foods contains heme, which the company claims gives the burger its bloody look and taste.

Early life Sarah Reisen was born in 1885 to Kalmen Reisen and Kreyne Epstein. Kalmen was a writer, as were her two brothers, Abraham and Zalmen. At home, she learned Torah portions from her father, Hebrew from the rabbi's wife, German from her mother, and Russian from her teacher. Her mother died when Reisen was ten, after which she briefly lived in Vinitze and Mohilne. Reisen moved then to Minsk at the age of 14, where she worked as a seamstress and a Russian tutor, and continued her studies. Reisen got married in 1904 to writer David Kasel and had a son Moishe. This marriage ended in a divorce, however, and, after moving around for a few years, she immigrated to New York City in 1933. Career Reisen's first work, a publication of a sketch in Russian as well as a translation of a work by I.L. Peretz was published when she was seventeen. She soon joined the Yiddish literary circle, writing sketches, short stories, and poems for various periodicals and publications such as Di Folkstzaytung, Der Veg, Der Fraynd, The Forward, Feder, and her brother's publication Eyropeyishe Literatur, sometimes under the pen name Sarah Kalmens. Reisen is one of a number of women poets writing in Yiddish, many of whom were Litvaks and whom Dovid Katz acknowledges for their contribution to the establishment of Yiddish as a respected language for producing literary material. Along with writing for publications, she wrote and performed for Yiddish Theater. Her translations into Yiddish include, among others, works by Tolstoy, Andreyev, Turgenev, and Pushkin. She is known for working on children's books and adapting works of Oscar Wilde for Yiddish schools. Reisen died on October 25, 1975 in New York City.

Formally, the cemetery is divided between 1st Forest Cemetery, with entrance from Aizsaules Street, and 2nd Forest Cemetery, with entrance from Gaujas Street. In 1904, German Lutheran congregations in Riga inquired the Riga City Council for allotment of land for a cemetery in the Me≈æaparks neighbourhood. It was planned to become a new large cemetery after the Great Cemetery, that was established 1773 in Riga and had exhausted its potential. The prominent Baltic-German landscape architect Georg Kuphaldt was author of the original construction project presented 1908, which should have appeared as a park with a central via funeralis, with many small and lateral paths along the graves with low fences and small monuments. The Forest Cemetery was established 29 July 1910 following a decision made by the 3rd Imperial Duma, and it was inaugurated 19 June 1913. All burial ceremonies were conducted in a building erected 1913 after blueprints by the Baltic-German architect Wilhelm Neumann. During World War I, when the front closed in on Riga in 1916, the Forest Cemetery was receiving many fallen Latvian Riflemen. After a lengthy debate with local congregations, the Imperial Duma sanctioned the construction of a military cemetery, on land transferred from the Forest Cemetery, a cemetery that later was named Brothers' Cemetery.

He was also well known for being a founding member of the Sigma Pi Phi fraternity and pioneering an effective treatment for rheumatism.  Personal life  Algernon B. Jackson was born in Princeton, Indiana on May 21, 1878 to Charles A. Jackson and Sarah L. (n√©e Brashear) Jackson. His mother was a public school teacher in the area and received an extensive education at several institutions, including Indiana University, University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, and Drexel Institute. Jackson considered himself mulatto and was reported to have belonged to the Republican party. He married Elizabeth A. Newman on June 20, 1920 in Media, Pennsylvania. He died on October 22, 1942 in his home in Washington, D.C. at age 64.  Career  Jackson attended Indiana University for his undergraduate education and then continued on to Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, where, in 1901, he earned his M.D. He completed additional post-graduate work at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania. He then became an assistant surgeon at Philadelphia Polyclinic Hospital‚Äîan institution run exclusively by white physicians. He was the first and only black surgeon to work at the hospital at that time and kept the position for thirteen years. Jackson ran in rather privileged circles within the African American community and had clear ties to Booker T. Washington (via the National Negro Health Movement) and Henry McKee Minton (a well-established doctor of a notoriously wealthy African American family), among others. In 1907, Jackson cofounded the Mercy Hospital School for Nurses and undertook the position of Surgeon-in-Chief, which he maintained for 15 years before becoming the hospital's Superintendent. He continued in this position for 9 more years until 1921, at which point he left to accept a job at Howard University. He was succeeded as Superintendent by friend and fellow co-founder of Sigma Pi Phi, Henry McKee Minton. From 1921 to 1934 he was a professor of bacteriology and public health, from 1921 to 1925 he was the director of the School of Public Health, and from 1926 to 1928 he was physician in charge at Howard University. Jackson made headlines in the medical community for discovering the injection of magnesium sulphate as an effective treatment for rheumatism in 1911. In 1904, Jackson, Henry McKee Minton, and two other fellow African American medical professionals became the founding members of Sigma Pi Phi, the first black Greek Letter organization, with the goal of uniting other like-minded black professionals in the North. He authored three books: Evolution and Life: A Series of Lay Sermons, The Man Next Door, and Jim and Mr. Eddy: A Dixie Motorlogue.  Public health involvement  Jackson was heavily involved with the National Negro Health movement during his years as director of the School of Public Health at Howard University until his death in 1942. The movement itself was established in 1915 by Booker T. Washington, who was impressed by the Negro Organization Society of Virginia's implementation of a ‚Äúclean-up week‚Äù in 1913, and sought to bring similar ideals of sanitation and hygiene to a wider national African American audience with National Negro Health Week. Jackson championed this idea, acting as a director of the movement for much of his later life, most likely beginning in the 1920s and continuing into the early 1930s. Jackson was extremely concerned with the relatively high mortality rates of African Americans‚Äîspecifically those in the poverty-stricken South‚Äîand personally believed that educating the African American community on matters of public health and hygiene was the most effective way to uplift the race in all aspects of life. He received most of his notoriety and authority in the African American community from his involvement with the movement, and was even asked to be a delegate to the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection by then-President Hoover in 1930. Although primarily based out of Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., Jackson made several tours through the South, speaking at African American public schools and community youth centers on matters of hygiene and disease prevention and visiting hospitals to determine the state of Negro health care throughout the country. His findings from the latter tours were published in several journals and included calls to action for the government and the public to improve clinical facilities for Southern African Americans by allocating more money, better equipment, more qualified staff, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîpreventative educational components. Jackson also used his platform as a public health columnist in several African American regional newspapers to report on his findings of the state of Negro health in America, which were overwhelmingly described as disappointing or atrocious. The audience he reached through his journalistic work‚Äîin publications like the Pittsburgh Courier, the New York Amsterdam News, the Baltimore Afro-American, and the Chicago Defender‚Äîwas overwhelmingly middle- class, Northern African Americans. His regular columns ranged from health advice (‚ÄúAfro Health Talk‚Äù in the Baltimore Afro-American) to opinion pages (‚ÄúWeek-End Mosaics‚Äù in the Pittsburgh Courier), but all were ultimately concerned with the social stature of African Americans.  Personal beliefs concerning race  Dr. Algernon B. JacksonIn his article ‚ÄúThe Need of Health Education Among Negroes,‚Äù he underscored the notion that ‚Äúno man, whatever his motive may be, can help lift up his brother without lifting up himself.‚Äù In other words, educating the African American community in public health and hygiene would not only lift the race itself by reducing rates of mortality and illness, it would also benefit the whites who would inevitably find themselves in contact with blacks. However, it was abundantly clear that, in Jackson's eyes, not all African Americans shared equal responsibility for the sub-par health of the race as a whole. Most often, the blame for harmful ignorance of public health issues fell on the shoulders of the poor Southern blacks. In turn, Jackson asserted that it was up to black medical leaders to ‚Äúsave a great people who really know very little about how to save themselves.‚Äù Most of Jackson's writing‚Äîboth for the lay public and medical community‚Äîincluded implications of classism and elitism that set Southern blacks lower on the hierarchy than wealthier blacks in cosmopolitan northern cities. On at least one occasion in ‚ÄúWeek-End Mosaics,‚Äù Jackson assured his largely educated Northern readership that their illness and death rates were no worse off than those of Northern whites, and that they were thusly not to blame for high Negro mortality. Southern blacks, on the other hand, he claimed ‚Äúhave no appreciation of [life] and use it to no more purpose than does the dumb animal.‚Äù As such, he called upon the educated black masses‚Äîmuch like he did with the black medical community‚Äîto reach the ‚Äúpoor unfortunate neglected members of our race‚Äù and teach them ‚Äúthat better living means better health, longer life, a finer happiness and a greater power for doing the things which we all as a race want to do‚Ä¶[to] make us unafraid and unconquerable.‚Äù In 1928, he reported for the Philadelphia Tribune on a German study in which the blood of Jews, Ukrainians, and Russians was tested and analyzed for differences. Jackson wrote that variations were observed (like how quickly the blood reacted with different chemicals, which they chalked up to ‚Äúoxidation‚Äù) but the implications and significance of these findings was left simply at the fact that people of difference ‚Äúraces‚Äù or ethnicities are, in fact, ‚Äúchemically different.‚Äù Regardless of the vagueness of the study and its probable ties to Nazi-backed eugenic exploration, Jackson clearly took a great interest in the experiment and hopefully suggested that ‚Äúracial identity may be fixed by chemical analysis‚Äù in the future. He additionally implied that determining racial makeup through objective measures could potentially prove ‚Äúmore unpopular with whites than with Negroes,‚Äù either because it will reveal less pure bloodlines in whites, or chemical superiority in blacks. Despite his occasional favoritism of Northern African Americans and apparent eugenic interests, Jackson did not spare even the most refined and economically advantaged blacks personal hygiene advice, particularly in his ‚ÄúAfro Health Talk‚Äù column. Although he was touted in this publication specifically as a ‚ÄúHealth Authority and Stomach Specialist,‚Äù his column explored all matters of preventative medicine, and often linked health issues with the societal perceptions or stereotypes of African Americans. For example, in a column about tuberculosis prevention, Jackson blamed ‚Äúignorance, carelessness, indifference, immorality, vicious living and unwillingness to accept advice‚Äù for the ‚Äúuntutored‚Äù black community's mortality rates from tuberculosis. But even more so, it was the fault of ‚Äúthe social and economic maladjustment born of a slimy race prejudice indigenous to America‚Äù that prevented ‚Äúall citizens, black and white, [from facing] life and death on equal terms.‚Äù References 1878 births 1942 deaths People from Princeton, Indiana African-American physicians American surgeons ","title":"Algernon B.

Chris Schofield is a professor of organic chemistry at the University of Oxford, Department of Chemistry and a Fellow of Hertford College. Prof Schofield studied functional, structural and mechanistic understanding of enzymes that employ oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate. His work has opened up new possibilities in antibiotic research, oxygen sensing, and gene regulation. After work on plant and microbial oxygenases, he studied uncharacterised human oxygenases. His research has identified unanticipated roles for oxygenases in regulating gene expression, importantly in the cellular hypoxic response, and has revealed new post-translational modifications to chromatin and RNA splicing proteins. The work has identified new opportunities for medicinal intervention.  Education  Chris Schofield attended St Anselm's College catholic grammar school in Merseyside, then studied for a Bachelor of Science in chemistry at the University of Manchester and graduated with a first class honour (1979‚Äì1982). In 1982, he moved to Oxford to study for a DPhil with Professor Jack E. Baldwin. In 1985, he became a Departmental Demonstrator in the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, Oxford University followed by his appointment as a Lecturer in Chemistry and a Fellow of Hertford College in 1990. In 1998, he became professor of Chemistry, and in 2011 he was appointed the Head of Organic Chemistry at the Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford. In 2013, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, FRS.  Research  The work in laboratory of Chris Schofield focuses on different areas of research, including: = Molecular Mechanisms of the Hypoxic Response = Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric Œ±,Œ≤-transcriptional complex that mediates the cellular response to oxygen availability in multi-cellular organisms, ranging from the simplest known animal Trichoplax adhaerens to humans. Investigating the structures and mechanisms of the HIF prolyl hydroxylases is a current focus of the work. The group solved crystal structures of PHD2 \\\\- one of the human prolyl hydroxylases - and discovered that the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase also catalyses hydroxylation of conserved motifs, the ankyrin repeat domain. = Chemical Basis of Epigenetics = A current focus of the group is modification of histones, in particular oxygenase catalysed N-demethylation of histone methylated-lysine residues ‚Äì in collaboration with the Structural Genomics Consortium. The histone demethylases are of interest both with respect to their links to diseases, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, as well as the role of methylation in transcriptional regulation. Recent areas of interest include the fat mass and obesity protein which was shown to be a nucleic acid demethylase and JMJD6 which is a lysyl hydroxylase modifying RNA splicing protein. = Structural and Functional Studies on 2OG Oxygenases = The 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenases are a superfamily of non-haem iron dependent oxygenases, most of which use the Krebs cycle intermediate, 2OG, as a co-substrate. The group are interested in understanding these enzymes for their ability to catalyse synthetically difficult or 'impossible' reactions (e.g. the stereoselective hydroxylation of unactivated carbon- hydrogen bonds), for their diverse physiological roles, and for their links to disease. The research focuses on members of the family that are linked to disease, or can be targeted for the treatment of disease. Techniques involved in this interdisciplinary research include proteomics, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, biological mass spectrometry, molecular biology, enzyme kinetics, protein-directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry and organic synthesis/medicinal chemistry. = Antibiotics: Biosynthesis and Resistance Mechanisms = Most clinically used antibiotics are based upon natural products. The most important family of antibiotics contains a Œ≤-lactam ring, and includes the penicillin, cephalosporin, clavam, and carbapenem antibiotics. The group's biosynthetic work has focused on the clavams and carbapenems, with a particular focus being on the mechanism and structures of enzymes that catalyse chemically 'interesting' steps. The biggest threat to the continued use of Œ≤-lactam antibiotics is that of bacterial resistance. Prof Schofield is currently working on the design and synthesis of enzyme inhibitors for the metallo Œ≤-lactamases ‚Äì there are no clinically used inhibitor of these enzymes but they pose a significant threat as they catalyse the hydrolysis of almost all clinically used Œ≤-lactam antibiotics. A particular interest involves human metallo Œ≤-lactamases which share the same fold.

The congress gathered 1872 delegates from all regions of Belarus and was violently dispersed by Bolshevik military. The congress played an important role in the consolidation of the Belarusian national liberation movement after the October Revolution in Russia. The council that was selected at the congress formed the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic and on 25 March 1918 declared the independence of Belarus as the Belarusian Democratic Republic. Background By early 1917, Belarus has been part of the Russian Empire. Following the February and October Revolutions in Russia, the Bolsheviks who came to power have promised free self-determination to all nations living in the former Russian Empire, including possibility to gain full independence. The Belarusian political organizations, representing regions with a Belarusian majority population, decided to hold a conference in order to work out a solidary position regarding the future of Belarus. The Supreme Belarusian Council, a central platform consolidating Belarusian organizations, has been the organizer of the conference. The congress The flag of the Belarusian national liberation movement used at the congress A total of 1872 delegates came to the conference. They represented all regions of Belarus. The delegates were representatives of various social and political organizations, local governments, trade unions, as well as of refugees to Russia, soldiers of the Russian army and diasporas in Petrograd and Moscow The congress has elected the Council of the First All-Belarusian Congress of 71 members under the leadership of Jan Sierada. The Council, in turn, formed an executive committee which was to serve as the organizing body in the process of establishing a modern constitutional democratic Belarusian state. There were active discussions on various topics of the future of Belarus, with the main question being the future form of state of Belarus. Right wing leaning delegates and many delegates from western Belarus insisted on immediately declaring full independence of Belarus from Russia. Left-leaning delegates and delegates from the eastern regions of Belarus opposed this idea. Many of them proposed a status of Belarus as an entity within a democratic Russian Federation. In the night of 18 December 1917, the delegates adopted the first items of the final resolution, declaring Belarus a democratic republic but without yet defining its status in relation with Russia. At this point the Bolshevik soldiers violently interrupted the conference and arrested several participants. Aftermath The executive committee of the congress' council managed to maintain its activity in the underground up until Minsk was taken over by German forces in February 1918. It later transformed into the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic (Rada BNR) and declared the independence of Belarus in March 1918. The Rada BNR later held negotiations with various foreign governments regarding the international recognition of the independence of Belarus and still exists in exile today. According to Belarusian authors, the congress has managed to bring the question of Belarus on the international agenda. In particular, the Soviets were criticized for dispersing the conference at the Soviet-German Brest-Litovsk peace conference and in a few articles in German, Swiss and Russian non-Bolshevik media. According to a widespread view in Belarus, the conference had a pivotal meaning for the Belarusian independence movement, the future establishment of the Belarusian Democratic Republic and later the Belarusian Soviet Republic. In February 1919, the Bolsheviks held their own conference with an almost identical name, the First All-Belarusian Congress of the Soviets of Worker, Peasant and Red army Soldier Deputies, at the same venue as the First All- Belarusian Congress.–Ø–∫ –ë–ù–† –∑–∞–≤–∞—è–≤–∞–ª–∞ –Ω–µ–∑–∞–ª–µ–∂–Ω–∞—Å—Ü—å –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—É The Soviet Congress adopted the constitution of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Belarus.

A native of the Bra»ôov area, he studied law until the 1848 revolution, when he took up arms. After order was restored, he embarked on a four-decade career in government that took him throughout his native Transylvania as well as to Vienna and Budapest. During the 1860s, Pu»ôcariu was involved in the political debates of his province's Romanians, and also helped set up their key cultural organization, Astra. His historical interests lay primarily with the Transylvanian Romanians' nobility and their genealogy; Pu»ôcariu's research into the subject secured his election to the Romanian Academy. Origins and 1848 revolution The first-born son of a Romanian Orthodox priest in Sohodol, a village located in the Transylvania region's Bra»ôov County, he had eight siblings, and attended primary school in his native village.Ber√©nyi, p. 158 In 1834, he entered the German normal school in Bra»ôov, and in 1837, the local Catholic high school. In 1841‚Äì1842, he attended the final year of gymnasium at Sibiu, as well as a yearlong theology course.Edroiu, p. 2 From 1843 to 1845, he took philosophy at the high school in Cluj, remaining for an additional year after completing this cycle. There, his classmates included Nicolae Popea, Avram Iancu and Alexandru Papiu-Ilarian.Edroiu, pp. 2‚Äì3 From 1846 to 1848, he audited courses at the Saxon law faculty in Sibiu. Pu»ôcariu was there when the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 began in Transylvania; he joined the movement in March. Known as the flag-bearer of the May 1848 Blaj Assembly, he was elected to a 25-member permanent committee of Romanians. Enrolling in the national guard, he was named \\"major tribune\\" of his native Burzenland's prefecture starting that October,Josan, p. 287 and around the same time was named a teacher at the Romanian school in Bra»ôov. In November, he was named assessor (councilor) of the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô district, as well as inspector of the M√¢ndra area. The last important political event of 1848 in which Pu»ôcariu took part was the December assembly at Sibiu, convoked by Metropolitan Andrei »òaguna in order to discuss the problems faced by the Romanian nation in a Transylvania considered \\"pacified\\" by General Anton von Puchner. In early 1849, while armed confrontations against Sz√©kely forces took place nearby, Pu»ôcariu was able to exercise his administrative functions until FƒÉgƒÉra»ô was occupied by J√≥zef Bem's troops in March. At that point, he fled across the RucƒÉr-Bran Pass into Wallachia, remaining until the revolution was crushed. Administrative and legislative career Pu»ôcariu then returned home, reoccupying the post of deputy FƒÉgƒÉra»ô prefect in autumn 1849.Josan, p. 318Ber√©nyi, p. 159 He was subsequently named commissioner and then circuit judge for the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô district, holding office from 1850 to 1861. During these years, his seat of jurisdiction shifted from Per»ôani in 1850 to Vi»ôtea de Jos, Deva and Pui, all in 1851, to Vene»õia de Jos in 1854. From 1861 to 1862, he worked at the imperial Transylvanian chancery in Vienna. He took part in the national assembly of Romanians held at Sibiu in January 1861, serving as secretary; the meeting asked for enhanced rights for the community. From 1862 to 1865, he administered K√ºk√ºll≈ë County from Cetatea de BaltƒÉ, while from 1865 to 1867, he was supreme captain of the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô district. However, he was unable to pay close attention to the problems of the local Romanians while in this role, as he was a deputy in the Diet of Transylvania during the same period. First sent to this chamber at Sibiu for the 1863‚Äì1864 session, he was named by the government to the Cluj Diet of November 1865. In 1867, following the creation of Austria-Hungary, he became an adviser on matters pertaining to the Orthodox Church at Hungary's Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education in Budapest. He took part in the \\"coronation diet\\" held at Budapest in 1867‚Äì1868. Elected for a FƒÉgƒÉra»ô seat, he voted against the nationalities law and asked that before Transylvania was absorbed into Hungary proper, discussions be held with the non-Hungarian nationalities.Ber√©nyi, pp. 159‚Äì60 From 1869 to 1890, when he retired, he was a judge on the Curia Regia. He then moved to Bran, near his native village. After his death, Pu»ôcariu was buried in the local family crypt.Edroiu, p. 3 He and his wife Stana Circa, born in 1831, had four sons: Ion, an engineer and manager in CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne, the state railway carrier of the Romanian Old Kingdom; Iuliu, who became a judge at the court of appeals in Budapest; Emil, a physician and professor at Romania's University of Ia»ôi; and Iuliu, a diplomat who represented Austria- Hungary as consul at Tangier and Moscow.Ioan Opri»ô, Alexandru Lapedatu √Æn cultura rom√¢neasc«é, p. 14. Bucharest: Editura »òtiin»õific«é, 1996. Octav George Lecca, Familiile boere»ôti rom√¢ne, p. 588. Bucharest: Editura Minerva, 1899. Cultural and political involvement In 1864, thanks to his bureaucratic, administrative and judicial service, Pu»ôcariu was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown, third class, allowing him and his descendants to use the title of knight. He describes the coat of arms he then received in his work on the Romanian noble families of Transylvania. His legal and theological background allowed Pu»ôcariu to help »òaguna draft an organic statute for the church, and he helped convince the government to approve the statute in the spring of 1869.Ber√©nyi, p. 160 The same year, he took part in a conference at Miercurea Sibiului, where the National Party of Romanians in Transylvania was created. During the event, the proponents of political passivism and activism clashed; Pu»ôcariu figured prominently in the latter camp, arguing that while the Romanian deputies to the diet had achieved little, they had made their voices heard, and that whatever the Romanians did, the Hungarian and Saxon nations would continue to elect deputies and pass laws. Despite these arguments, passivism, a withdrawal from the political life of the new dualist state, was adopted as an official strategy by a wide margin, and its adherents attacked Pu»ôcariu in their newspapers.Ber√©nyi, p. 160-61 Although his position as a judge barred him from overt political activity, he and »òaguna, through the intermediary of his brother Ilarion, continued to discuss relaunching activism. In 1872, he published a brochure containing a political program, but this was rejected both by the Sibiu party meeting in May and by the conference at Alba Iulia the following month. At that point, he essentially withdrew from politics until making a brief return in 1884, when a Romanian Moderate Party was initiated by Miron Romanul. However, few joined the organization, which was met with disapproval by most of the Romanian populace and by the Hungarian government. He was gladdened by the decision to switch to activism was taken in early 1905 by the Romanian National Party.Ber√©nyi, p. 161 He played an important role in the founding of Astra, helping to draft the organization's statute, which was approved by Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1861.Ber√©nyi, p. 162 He then served as an active member, addressing its assemblies and working within the historical section. During the association's first general meeting, he delivered a speech underlining the historic value of documents regarding the Romanian noble families of Transylvania, Banat, Cri»ôana, Maramure»ô and Bukovina. In order to gauge the approximate extent of these families, he launched an appeal to the leaders of his church and of the Romanian Greek- Catholic Church, as well as to prominent figures in the community, asking them to submit data on a prepared form. After retiring to Bran, he supervised the activity of the local Astra chapter. Pu»ôcariu was also involved in the Romanian cultural and church life of Budapest, developing close friendships with community leaders and promoting the construction of a theater. He weighed in on the era's philological disputes, siding with Timotei Cipariu and George Bari»õ in his preference for an etymological-based orthography. Contributions to history and genealogy Elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy in 1877, Pu»ôcariu rose to titular status in 1900, participating in the organization's general meetings until the end of his life. During his administrative career, Pu»ôcariu was preoccupied by the politics and law of Transylvania, publishing a dictionary of official, bureaucratic terms in Romanian in 1860, with a new edition in 1863. Additionally, a brochure comprising forms for public acts and documents appeared at Vienna in 1861. A particular contributor to his election as a full member of the Academy was the genealogical work Date istorice privitoare la familiile nobile rom√¢ne; covering two volumes and running to 630 pages, it was published at Sibiu in 1892 and 1895, and includes an especially rich genealogical material. The genesis of the project was his Astra appeal of 1862, but it lay largely dormant for three decades, and was only taken up again in earnest after 1890, by which time new scholarly material had been written on the topic, and old documents re-edited.Edroiu, p. 4 His maiden speech to the Academy, \\"Ugrinus‚Äî1291\\", focused on history, aiming to rebut Robert R√∂sler's theory that the ancestors of the Romanians migrated northwards from the south- Danubian area. Pu»ôcariu's view on the origin of the Romanians is that they continually crossed the Danube and the Carpathians, both north and south, from the time of Trajan onwards.Chisacof, p. 117 His subsequent volumes, chiefly Boierii din »öara FƒÉgƒÉra»ôului, solidified his presence at the forefront of genealogy in the Romanian-speaking lands.Edroiu, p. 1 Pu»ôcariu wrote about his own political, scientific and cultural activity, and the material was edited posthumously as √énsemnƒÉri biografice by Ilarion Pu»ôcariu. His interests extended to his own family history, which he covered in two of his books. Based on preserved tradition, he insisted that a distant ancestor, Iuga, left Maramure»ô for Moldavia during the reign of Drago»ô, after which the family extended into Bessarabia. He asserted that family members crossed into Transylvania in the early 17th century in order to participate in an anti- Ottoman rebellion, and were active in a similar conflict in the first half of the 18th century, during the time of the Cantemire»ôti. He believed they first settled around Ca»ôin and then reached the Bra»ôov area. He was certain that his great-grandfather Bucur, his grandfather Leonte and his father Ioan were all parish priests in Sohodol. He noted that the family used to be called Pu»ôca»ôiu, connoting a Military Frontier guard (pu»ôca»ô meaning \\"rifleman\\"). He was the first to be called Pu»ôcariu: in November 1848, revolutionary leaders August Treboniu Laurian and Ioan Bran de Lem√©ny, after he took up the office of assessor, wrote him down as Pu»ôcariu. The rest of the family followed suit in changing its name.

His father was the well-known architect and designer Gerrit Rietveld.  Education  Wim Rietveld received a technical education and began his career as a constructor of large equipment; among others, he was employed at Servo Balans, a company specialized in industrial weighing equipment. In 1950 he enrolled as one of the first students of a newly established course in industrial design at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague.  Design career  Because of the high quality of his graduation project, Rietveld was invited by W. H. Gispen to start working for his Gispen furniture company. At that moment, postwar reconstruction was in full force in the Netherlands, and materials were scarce. Wim Rietveld was employed at Gispen from 1953 till 1957. He was talented in combining functionality and aesthetics in his furniture, and was able to devise simple production techniques. He was a typically Dutch designer in his love for construction and functionality. Unlike other typical Gispen furniture, Rietveld's designs did not use hollow tubular steel, but much thinner massive steel, which looks less conspicuous and is easier (and cheaper) to bend. Wim Rietveld also introduced foam rubber padding and pressed plywood at the Gispen company. Panama lamp, produced by Gispen, 1953 Rietveld worked on several well-known Gispen furniture pieces, including the President office chair, and several light fixtures. He enjoyed a lot of artistic freedom at Gispen. His most well-known design is probably the Mondial chair, which he devised together with his father, Gerrit Rietveld. The stackable and linkable, delicate K-shaped chair was specifically created for Expo 58 in Brussels. It was intended to be fully executed in aluminum, but apart from a few prototypes this was not followed through at that time, as that was not yet technically possible. Gispen produced the chair's seat in polyester, against Rietveld's wishes. Shortly afterwards, Rietveld quit his position at Gispen. Chair designed for De Cirkel / Ahrend Next, Rietveld started working for De Cirkel (a daughter of Ahrend), a company that also produced steel furniture, where he became a colleague of Friso Kramer. There, Rietveld produced his Pyramid chair and worked on the Reply drawing table together with Kramer. Rietveld was employed at De Cirkel until 1970. He also worked as a freelancer on various assignments. One of his contractors was Vicon, a producer of farming equipment, from 1959 till 1979. Together with Wim Groeneboom, Rietveld designed the first Amsterdam metro, he drew the Dutch 'standard bus' (1966), and he was contracted by companies such as Werkspoor (train interiors) and Inventum (home appliances).  Teaching  From 1960 till 1975, Rietveld was a teacher at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague, and from 1970 till 1979 at the Technische Hogeschool (the later University of Technology) in Delft, where he held a professorship from 1973.

She has been called a Marschitect. Mulyani was born in Indonesia and earned a master's degree in Architecture, Landscape, and Urban Design from Ecole d'Architecture de Nantes, in France before moving to the United States. She founded Mars City Design in 2015.  Early life  Born in Indonesia, Vera Mulyani grew up in the polluted slums of Jakarta where at the age of 15, she became a translator for a European Magazine, who later inquired about her artwork and encouraged her to exhibit her creations. French collectors who viewed Mulyani's art further encouraged her creative abilities mentioning that she should consider training to be an artist in Paris. This recommendation in addition to the rising violence near Mulyani's home during the 1998 terrorist attacks in Jakarta convinced her to move to France to pursue her artistic education.  Early career  In 2001 Mulyani entered Ecole d'Architecture de Nantes, in France where she earned a master's degree in Architecture, Landscape, and Urban Design and took a job working with one of the most prestigious architects in Southern France, Rudy Ricciotti. This brought her the chance to design a famous Villa in the South of France and be part of the design team for The Louvre Museum project, in Lens. Following her degree in architecture, Vera Mulyani displayed her thesis book \\"F*** da Rules\\", questioning Manhattan's urban design, forecasting the economy collapsing through the 2005‚Äì2007 construction boom. She formulated the concept of \\"Recycling Cities\\", which consisted of transforming damaged areas caused by industrialism into sustainable Green Zones, to better integrate the natural environment into human living spaces.  Filmmaker  Moving to New York City Vera Mulyani gained an interest in the art of film after her work on the documentary based on her thesis \\"F*** da Rules\\", she obtained a master's degree in Filmmaking from the New York Film Academy in 2010. Her two short films \\"Elah and the Moon\\" and \\"The Melody of Choice\\" were successfully crowdfunded and were hosted at the Cannes Film Festival as well as other prominent venues. Prior to these efforts Mulyani had completed her first short film, The Forgotten Land which was also featured at Cannes = Short films = The Forgotten Land which was inspired by the famous filmmaker David Lynch, is a fictitious story concerning two women from different time periods (one from the 19th century, the other from the 1960s) meeting on New York's Roosevelt Island and together discovering its history. The film was selected as part of the Cannes Film Festival's Short Film Corner in 2008 Elah and The Moon is a period-style fantasy film about a boy seeking love and approval from his father. Mulyani refers to it as ‚Äúa visual poem.‚Äù The film was selected for the Cannes Film Festival's Short Film Corner in both 2009 and 2010. The Melody of Choice which was selected for the first annual Louisiana Film Prize in 2012, is the story of a gifted boy who hears music in nature despite a challenging upbringing. He collects used cans as well as other trash and must \\"ultimately choose between forgoing his dreams to become a musician or moving ahead as his father's life hangs in the balance.\\"  Mars City Design  Moving to the Los Angeles area and finding inspiration in the vision of SpaceX, CEO Elon Musk, to begin colonizing Mars within the next decade, Vera Mulyani founded Mars City Design in 2015. Mars City Design is a collaborative platform created to explore the concept of livability and sustainability on Mars, as well as to contribute some solutions to the climate change on Earth. The company calls for an annual competition to field project based architectural designs that explore the feasibility of future Martian cities, as well as various forms of technological innovation that engineers key functions of livability and sustainability on Mars. Mars City Design calls not only on scientists and engineers, but also artists who wish to share their vision of a multi planetary society through their creative talents in visual, aural, and written mediums. Vera Mulyani, who has always dreamed of being an architect on Mars has articulated that the mission of the platform will be realized by creating structures and supporting technologies that will result in a viable city in the extreme environments of the red planet. In her own words Ms. Mulyani states: ‚ÄùIt is not enough to just travel to Mars and survive, now we must develop a way in which we can sustainably thrive on Mars. It is essential that we call on a new generation of thinkers and innovators to make this a reality.‚Äù In addition, Mars City Design recently completed a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to support a workshop named Mars City Power Lab, which will host design winning teams as well as contestants at the University of Southern California in September, 2016. Vera Mulyani and her Mars City Design vision were featured in a 2018-2019 documentary show, made for the Discovery Channel, with a total reach of 90 Million audiences from around the world, on multiple platforms;  Other activities  In addition to her activities as CEO of Mars City Design, Vera Mulyani is the Co Founder and Organizer of Spaceport LA. which is the \\"home base for space enthusiasts, learners and professionals living in Los Angeles, California.

He was born a slave but was allowed free movement and employment on the plantation of Kentucky politician James Harlan, who raised him and may have been his father or half-brother. He became interested in horse racing as a young man and moved to California during the 1849 Gold Rush where he was very successful. In 1859 he moved to England to import racehorses from America and race them in England. He returned to the United States in 1869 during reconstruction. He became friends with Ulysses S. Grant and became involved in Republican politics. For the rest of his life, he was involved in city, state, and national African-American civil rights and political movements. In 1870 he became colonel of the Second Ohio Militia Battalion, a black state militia battalion in Cincinnati. In 1886, he became a member of the Ohio House of Representatives.

His son, John Marshall Harlan, born in 1833, served as a US Supreme Court Justice from 1877 to 1911 and was known as the \\"Great Dissenter\\" for his support of civil rights against the segregationist majority court. The role of Robert Harlan in John Marshall's ideas is discussed in detail in Gordon (2000).Gordon, James W. \\"Did the First Justice Harlan Have a Black Brother?\\" in Critical Race Theory: The Cutting Edge, eds. Richard Delgado, Jean Stefancic Temple University Press, 2000 p 118-125 It was then that Robert took the name Harlan. =Birthplace and paternity= Supreme Court Judge John Marshall Harlan It is suggested that Robert's father was his Kentucky master, James Harlan, contradicting the story that his father died during Robert's trip with his mother to Cincinnati. Gordon (2000) traces this theory to a short biography of Robert in Dictionary of American Negro Biography by Paul McStallworth published in 1983,McStallworth, Paul, \\"Robert James Harlan\\" in Dictionary of American Negro Biography, eds Rayford W. Logan & Michael R. Winston, 1983, p 287-288 which is based on a biography of Robert in the Cincinnati Union on December 13, 1934, 37 years after Robert's death and places Robert's birth in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, then home of James Harlan. Newspaper articles during and immediately after Harlan's life as well as biography written about him during his life state that Robert was born in Virginia and James Harlan did not become Robert's master until later. However, Loren Beth proposes in a biography of John Marshall Harlan that if Robert was born in Virginia, it may have been John Marshall Harlan's grandfather, also named James, who fathered Robert. =Education and training= When Robert reached schooling age, James sent him to the village school at Harrodsburg along with his own sons. Robert was special in this regards, while his master was ambivalent about slavery, he did not routinely educate his slaves. A black janitor notified the school that Robert was black, and Robert was discharged from the school, an occurrence which led Robert to joke later in life that he had only \\"a half a day's schooling.\\" Robert was close to James' older sons, Richard and James, and when the children came home from school, Robert would study the same lessons of the other children, and thus became educated. Robert made money hunting and selling coonskins, and moved to Louisville where he learned to be a barber. At 16, Robert opened a store at Harrodsburg, where the Harlan's had moved in the early 1820s. At 19 he had saved enough money to buy a race horse. From this point, Harlan began racing and gambling on horses throughout the South and Southwest with good success. Although not formally freed, by 1840, Robert moved to Lexington, Kentucky where he appears in records as a \\"free man of color\\". That year James Harlan moved to Frankfort, Kentucky to become Kentucky's Secretary of State. Later, he married a woman from Lexington and he sold his shop in Harrodsburg and opened a grocery in Lexington. About the time Reverend John Tibbs was tarred and feathered and run out of Kentucky for his work educating black children, and Harlan decided Lexington was not a safe place to live and he moved to Louisville. In the 1840s, Harlan and his wife had five daughters. California Gold Rush and move to Cincinnati Robert's de facto emancipation was illegal and may have become a political liability for his master by the late 1840s. On September 18, 1848, James Harlan went to the Franklin County, Kentucky, Courthouse to free Robert. James continued to hold slaves after that date, with fourteen slaves appearing in his household in the 1850 census. James would die in 1863, but Robert and James' sons continued to be in contact, and James Harlan, Jr. looked to Robert for financial assistance in the 1880s. In 1848 or 1849, Harlan moved to California to seek his fortune. He opened a trading store with $2,000 he had made selling his horses. He was very successful in California, amassing about $50,000 dollars. He then moved to Cincinnati, achieving the goal he and his mother had for themselves many years before. At some point before moving to England, he paid a visit to James Harlan's family in Harrodsburg. James' wife showed Robert a letter James had from Robert's mother which had been written fourteen years earlier at Point Confee, Louisiana. Robert traveled to that place and learned that his mother had been sold back on the Attakapas. He met his mother there and purchased her freedom. However, she was married to the plantation foreman and preferred to stay with her husband rather than return North. Van Loo's photograph of the Workum family, possibly from the 1860s Harlan began working as a benefactor for black people in Cincinnati, becoming a trustee of the colored schools there and negotiating with Nicholas Longworth, Esq. for the building of the Eastern District School. He speculated in Cincinnati real estate and earned enough to purchase Bull's First Class Photographic and Daguerreotype Gallery where he employed a number of well known photographers including Charles Waldeck, James Landy, and Leon Van Loo. In 1851, he visited the World's Fair in London. About this time, he was or considered himself technically owned by James Harlan, although he was wealthier than the slave owner and had been freed a few years earlier. Robert returned to Kentucky and paid James $500 for his freedom. In Cincinnati, his fortune continued to grow, but in 1859 Harlan desired to escape the discrimination he felt in America and move to England to race horses. Horse racing in England Harlan moved to England with jockies Charley Kyte and Johnnie Ford, who later became a prominent horse trainer. Harlan's trainer was John Minor, whose son had a prominent career in the Lorillard stables. Harlan's thoroughbred race horses in England included the Cincinnati, Ochiltree, Deschiles, Powhattan, and Lincoln.\\"Turf Matters\\". Nashville Union and American (Nashville, Tennessee), February 20, 1859, page 2 He also brought a Kentucky trotting horse named Jack Rossiter. He stayed in England for ten years, adding more horses to his stable during that time. He was close friends with and adviser to another famous American turfman in England, Richard Ten Broeck.\\"The Turf in England\\". The Louisville Daily Courier (Louisville, Kentucky), October 7, 1858, page 1 Ten Broeck was the first American to ship a stable of horses to England, and Harlan was the second. Harlan made a number of famous, successful, large wagers in England. Harlan won a $5,000 wager that Jack Rossitter could trot 18, 19, and then 20 miles in an hour, a great feet for a trotting horse in England at that time. Harlan won $40,000 betting on Ten Broeck's horse, Prioress, when she won the Czarowitz stakes at 200 and 100 to 1. When he left America, Harlan invested his money into American securities which at the time would earn him an income of $7,000 per year. However, his investment lost most of their value during the US Civil War which spanned 1861‚Äì1865.

It was a guard unit composed of mainly coloured and Asian conscripts.  History  It was formed on 1 January 1978 from existing units known as Reserve Holding Units and Protection Units. The Reserve Holding Units (for support roles) and Protection Units (for escorting supplies in combat zones) contained Rhodesia's coloured (i.e. mixed race) and Asian personnel, including both conscripts and volunteers. The regiment consisted of seven companies, organized into the 1 Mashonaland Battalion at Cranborne Barracks in Salisbury and 2 Matebeleland Battalion at Brady Barracks in Bulawayo. The regimental training depot was located at Inkomo, near Salisbury. One RDR battalion was attached to each brigade headquarters to guard military installations and lines of communication. It was also tasked with railway patrolling, convoy protection, and regular infantry duties. From its formation, the regiment was also used to mobilise white reservists over the age of 38, although it was mostly coloured and Asian. The drafts of white reservists and conscripts were usually low quality and were barely trained, and suffered from poor morale due to being attached to notoriously inefficient units. Due to its poor discipline, the RDR was disparagingly nicknamed the \\"Rhodesian Dagga Regiment\\", after the slang term for marijuana. Paul Moorcraft and Pete McLaughlin have written that the RDF units \\"would have had little chance\\" if they were ever attacked by a determined enemy force. The RDR was disbanded shortly after the 1980 Southern Rhodesian general election.  Engagements  An example of the Regiment's role in defence of Rhodesia's strategic installations during the Second Chimurenga was witnessed in the events of 15 November 1978, at Otto Beit Bridge (on the Zambezi River) where the RDR was the most forward army unit during a major (>250 bomb) mortar, rocket and machine-gun attack on Rhodesian army positions at the Chirundu border. In this engagement the RDR contributed, as first line of defence, to the 'neutralisation' of the enemy positions. The Rhodesia Herald, 18 November 1978 (from a Combined Operations communique): \\"On Wednesday night, 15 November 1978, security forces in the Chirundu area were subjected to a prolonged and unprovoked rocket, mortar and small-arms attack. 250 bombs landed in Rhodesia. There was no damage or casualties. Security forces fired back and neutralised the attack\\".

Retrieved August 8, 2016 In May 1913, after corresponding with Herbert Macaulay in Nigeria and traveling to the US, he began holding large camp-style meetings in Oklahoma and elsewhere, encouraging African-Americans to buy $25 worth of stock in his Akim Trading Company, join a voyage to their \\"ancestral home\\", settle on fertile land that he claimed to have purchased there, reject America and live a life of freedom. His stated intentions were to help develop trade between West Africa and the United States, by selling commodities such as cocoa, coffee and mahogany to the US, and encouraging black American farmers and mechanics to settle in Africa and so develop the economy there. Among his claims were stories of \\"diamonds lying on the ground after a rain, trees that produced bread, and sugar cane as large as stove pipes\\".Larry O'Dell, \\"Chief Alfred Sam\\", Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved August 8, 2016 Although his scheme was criticized by black businesses and newspapers, and by the authorities, he was cleared of fraud. He was supported by the African Pioneer, a journal of the Back-to-Africa movement, and persuaded hundreds of families to sell their possessions and invest in his scheme. By early 1914, some 500 black Americans were prepared to sail to Africa on Sam's ship, the former German steamer Curityba which he renamed the S.S. Liberia, and assembled at Galveston, Texas. An initial group of some sixty trained and selected men and women were eventually taken on board and left with Sam in August 1914, together with a cargo of lumber, cement, lime, flour, agricultural implements, and household goods with which to establish a settlement. They arrived in Bathurst (now Banjul), Gambia, in December 1914, and both there and in Freetown, Sierra Leone, received considerable publicity. After a long delay in Freetown while British authorities checked the ship's ownership, they eventually reached their destination, Saltpond, in January 1915, and were initially given a warm reception. However, their attempt to settle at Akim failed as local leaders refused to allow Americans to own the necessary land, and because of official restrictions, shortages of materials, and malaria. Many of the intending settlers suffered physical and financial hardships, were discouraged, and felt misled by Sam's claims. Some eventually returned to Oklahoma, while others settled in African cities or Liberia. By September 1915, before a second voyage could take place, Sam's venture collapsed, with most of those still intending to make the voyage losing their possessions and savings. Sam sold the Liberia, and returned to work as a trader. Sources give differing accounts of his later life, with one stating that he also moved to Liberia, while others indicate that he returned to live in the US. It is thought that he died some time during the 1930s.

The character made her first on-screen appearance on 8 November 2013. Wall had three auditions for the role on the show's set in Liverpool. The character is introduced as the sister of Clare Devine (Gemma Bissix), who had been killed off in earlier episodes. Grace arrives to investigate her death and get reacquainted with her estranged father Fraser Black (Jesse Birdsall). Grace's characterisation initially played her as a ruthless gangster. The character received an extensive character development from Hollyoaks executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and his team. He believed he had let Wall down with Grace's original characterisation. Focusing on the character's personality and style, he and Wall transformed her from a gangster who fought for \\"bags of money\\" to a more family oriented woman fighting for \\"love and loyalty\\". Production also created a unique style for the character with long acrylic nails and black suits. They later gave Grace a big bouffant hair style, that became a trademark of the character and gave her a bigger personality. Her introductory storyline focused on her damaged relationship with Fraser. He was soon killed off in a \\"whodunit\\" storyline, which placed Grace as a main suspect. Writers also created a long-term relationship for Grace alongside Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) and their relationship was centric to the character's storyline for three years. Grace gained a best friend in Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks) and writers used the friendship to transform Grace into a more likeable character with viewers. The character has been involved in many of the show's stories of her time. She has portrayed numerous kidnappings, fights, feuds and stunts. She has feuded with Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Big Bob (Vincent Ebrahim), Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan) and Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham). She has been pushed from a balcony, held hostage, shot, electrocuted, nearly killed Joe with a wrecking ball and has also been stalked by her secret lover Kim Butterfield (Daisy Wood-Davis). Grace's storylines have been both topical and dramatic ‚Äì her relationship with Trevor and Esther explored the issue of surrogacy, while her affair with Kim culminated in a dramatic car crash stunt. In 2016, writers brought about the end of Grace's relationship with Trevor. They played Trevor having an affair with Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) and later murdered by Sienna's teenage daughter Nico Blake (Persephone Swales-Dawson) during his wedding to Grace. Producers then introduced Grace's extended family, consisting of three half- brothers and her mother. Wall has received four award nominations for her portrayal of Grace, including one \\"Best Actress\\" nomination at the 2016 Inside Soap Awards. The character has been generally well received by critics of the genre. Wall has received praise for her performances of grief and others branded the character \\"ruthless\\". Casting Wall attended three auditions for the role. Her first was on the Hollyoaks set in Liverpool, where she also acted out some scenes alongside regular cast members Jesse Birdsall and Greg Wood, who play Fraser Black and Trevor Royle respectively. On 24 October 2013, Wall's casting as Grace was made public. The actress had already begun filming with Hollyoaks and a promotional image was released of her in character. Grace was given immediate links with other characters in the show. She arrives wanting to investigate the death of her sister Clare Devine (Gemma Bissix). It was also revealed she would share screen time with her father Fraser and his bodyguard Trevor. The character made her first on-screen appearance on 8 November 2013. Development =Characterisation= Personality Grace has been compared to a chameleon in her official character biography. This is because of her complex personality and differing attitudes depending on the type of characters that are sharing scenes with her. Grace behaves in an aggressive manner, has a ruthless mentality and can be a dangerous character to be around. For instance Grace's customers and acquaintances sometimes view her as \\"bubbly and warm\\". Though her close family and friends are more accustomed to a \\"cold, hard-nosed and uncompromising\\" nature ‚Äì but the character does process a \\"true soft side\\". In 2013, Wall told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that Grace is \\"pretty rock hard\\" and her childhood left her damaged emotionally. Fraser paid more attention to Clare and left Grace to fend for herself. Wall explained that \\"she was the strong one and quite tomboy-ish. Grace now spends her whole life putting on a front that you don't ever mess with her. But behind closed doors, she secretly wants to be quite girly ‚Äì although she'd never, ever show that!\\" Grace enjoys being involved in a criminal life style. She wants to prove to her father she can \\"handle herself in a man's world\\". She likes to have power over other people and use it to her advantage. Wall has said that Grace is \\"clever\\", \\"two-faced\\" and \\"sly\\" and different to her sister Clare. In July 2014, executive producer Bryan Kirkwood announced that he had planned to change Grace's characterisation. He told Kilkelly that \\"I acknowledge that we didn't get Grace's character right at first and I feel I let Tamara Wall down.\\" He was pleased with Wall's performance as Grace and was eager to explore other aspects of the character's personality. Kirkwood's team put much work into further developing Grace and allowing Wall to bring warmth to her on-screen counterpart's persona. Writers used an existing character, Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks) and made her Grace's best friend and \\"very surprising sidekick\\". Kirkwood believed it would throw Grace into a non-criminal world and see her behave different, smile more, show a softer side and offer the audience a chance to witness \\"other facets to her character.\\" Kirkwood later reflected that the changes had given her family, friends and \\"a great big beating heart\\". He remained committed to Grace doing bad deeds but hoped her development made the audience care about her more. In 2015, Writers played Grace trying to change her behaviour in preparation for motherhood. This added to the character's likeability with fans but Wall also wanted to keep Grace's dangerous side prevalent. She stated \\"I like the fact that she‚Äôs more likeable now, but it‚Äôs much more fun playing her as a baddie. As long as I get to walk through the village with a buggy in one hand and a gun in the other ‚Äì I‚Äôll be happy!\\" The actress later reflected on Grace's transformation. She told Ellie Hooper from Closer that Grace was a \\"one dimensional\\" character when she debuted. She observed a \\"big old change\\" and viewers could finally see her heart amongst the evil. She became friendlier as a result of mothering Curtis and writers ensured Grace had more comedy about her character. She dreams of a normal life even though it is not achievable for her given her past. She can be \\"a little bit of a freak\\" in her pursuit of the perfect family life, but ultimately Wall believed Grace would never get her \\"happily ever after\\". Wall enjoyed the complexities of Grace, adding \\"the best thing about her is that I still get to be the big evil baddie who‚Äôs not very nice, but at the same time, I get to be funny and I get to have a love story.\\" Kirkwood later said that the newly family oriented Grace \\"will be fighting for love and loyalty rather than bags of money.\\" Style The character's style was originally an attire resembling formal wear consisting of a black suit and blazer. Her hair was initially styled basic and flat. The look achieved is that of a Gangster moll. The character had large false nails to and these became a part of her early signature look. Wall explained that the nails were acrylic and she was required to wear them permanently. It took her time to adjust to wearing them but later felt strange without them. Wall branded it a trademark of the character that brightened up her black outfits. They also add to her strength as they have been as a weapon in \\"cat-fights\\". Production like Grace to wear pink nail varnish and this later became another distinctive trait of hers. The character wears eye make-up consisting of smoked out pencil kohl liner and several coats of black mascara. She is consistently styled in a range of blouses, some of which were purchased from real high street stores. The Hollyoaks wardrobe department aim to dress their characters to reflect their financial earnings. Grace earns a considerable amount of money in her line of work. Therefore, she is one of the shows most expensive characters to supply clothing for. When Wall is required to appear on-screen undressed she has to have a scar applied to her stomach. This was to accurately depict the scar tissue on the entry-point of a gun shot wound she endured on-screen. Producers later made a series of changes to Grace's characterisation. Her style changed and they introduced a new hairstyle, which has been described as an \\"enormous bouffant hair-do\\". Wall was happy with the changes because it helped develop Grace. She told an Inside Soap reporter that \\"as soon as I got this big hair, I felt the character get bigger. She strutted about more, and it brought a bit of comedy to her.\\" The actress has admitted that it took time for her make-up team to perfect Grace's look. She was unhappy with Grace's shot in the Hollyoaks opening title sequence because the hair was not big enough. But over time she began to leave the make-up department with almost square hair as it grew. Wall is supplied with an additional hair piece which is applied to her head each morning. It takes the make-up department two hours daily to wash, dress and curl it and an additional forty minutes to style it onto Wall's head. Grace's hair is very big and is often seen with differing styles, but always with plenty of volume in the roots to achieve her signature look. The hair style became known as \\"Beryl Bouffant\\" on the Hollyoaks set. The hair got so big that directors would sometimes complain that it was blocking views of other characters during filming. Backstory and introduction In the character's backstory, Fraser raised Grace and Clare as a single parent. He put his efforts into raising Clare, believing Grace was adept to look after herself. Their mother had walked out on them to escape Fraser's criminal life and started a new family. Fraser also raised Trevor but he had become romantically involved with Clare and got her pregnant. Grace secretly had feelings for Trevor too. Grace and Clare did not get along with each other. When Clare died it made Grace reflect on the relationship and realise she loved her sister. But Grace is upset that she never told her how she felt. This is the main motive Grace has in wanting revenge against her killer. Hollyoaks had a long-running theme of having a \\"dark gangster corner of the show\\" first created with the character Scott Anderson (Daniel Hyde). Grace was brought into the show to fill that role of the gangster running The Loft night club. When Grace arrives in the village she is determined to find out the truth behind Clare's death. She knows Doctor Browning (Joseph Thompson) killed her sister in a hit and run incident and wants revenge. She notices Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) and Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) behaving suspiciously and begins to monitor them. She also confronts Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) about Clare. Grace does not realise the three characters are covering up the murder of Doctor Browning. Lindsey becomes suspicious of Grace as soon as they meet. Austin told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that \\"Grace is quite intimidating. Considering her relations, I don't think she's going to be the nicest of characters.\\" She also has an problematic relationship with Fraser because she believes that he loved Clare more. The show began to develop Grace's first feud storyline for Grace with Mercedes. When Mercedes receives Doctor Browning's life insurance money she flaunts her wealth in the village. This infuriates Grace and her hatred for Mercedes grows. She visits Trevor and makes it clear she intends to get revenge. Grace's first feud with another gangster was quickly deployed on-screen. Ray McCormick (Cristian Solimeno) was introduced as an enemy of the Black family and targets Grace specifically. He kidnaps Grace, locks her away and demands ransom money in exchange for Grace's safety. Trevor becomes determined to secure her release and concocts a scam to steal Mercedes' money. Ray then dresses as Father Christmas and attends Fraser's wedding to Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth). He leaves a note for Fraser to aggravate him about his missing daughter's whereabouts. Writers soon escalated the feud into violence. Grace escapes and Trevor begins a scam selling counterfeit wine. Ray becomes annoyed with Trevor gaining more business and decides to vengefully target Grace once again. She visits Clare's grave and Ray organises to have her badly beaten and left for dead. Fraser decides to convince Trevor that Ray killed his father. He knows Trevor will try and kill Ray as a result. A Hollyoaks publicist stated that \\"all hell is set to break loose and these episodes are not to be missed.\\" =Fraser's lies and murder= Grace's relationship with Fraser is made more complicated when he reveals that he has fathered a child with Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis). She decides to interfere with his personal life. Grace befriends Tegan who is initially wary of Grace. She pretends to want her half-sister, Rose, in her life to which Tegan agrees. She invites Tegan on a day out in the countryside. Grace then attempts to bribe Tegan with money to leave the village for good. Ellis told Kilkelly that her character is shocked by Grace's behaviour and refuses to leave. She added \\"if there's an issue, it's one that Grace needs to sort out with her dad. Tegan isn't having any of it.\\" This infuriates Grace who threatens her over the edge of a cliff. Ellis said that Tegan realises what Grace is capable of and is terrified of being killed. Ellis and Wall filmed the cliff-top scenes on a cold and rainy day. Wall was scared that she would accidentally push her co-star off the cliff. Hollyoaks created a \\"Whodunit\\" storyline in which Fraser is murdered. Grace was a suspect because her relationship with Fraser deteriorated because of her involvement with Trevor. Fraser believed that they betrayed him and was considering having them killed. Tyler from Inside Soap reported that Grace realises she will be killed unless she take her own father out first. Sandy's son Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan) is determined to get Fraser out of the Roscoe family. He asks Trevor for help killing Fraser, who then brings Grace in on their plan. Grace is happy to oblige having fallen out with her father. Fraser and Sandy plan to travel by limousine to a special event. Grace, Trevor and Joe plan to lock Fraser in the vehicle and release poisonous gas to kill him. Grace betrays Joe and plans to frame him solely for the crime and also ensure Sandy dies too. The plot does go ahead but when Joe realises Sandy is in the limousine he rescues them from death. Fraser is later shot dead and Grace is genuinely angry and upset. She is left with Fraser's business and finances after his death. This makes other characters suspicious of her, believing she planned his murder for financial gain. Grace is a main suspect in the police investigation. Wall said \\"right after Fraser is killed, Grace is on the warpath to try and blame someone for the crime.\\" She wants to frame Tegan for the murder but later discovers a bag of clothes in Trevor's flat which leads her to believe he killed Fraser. Grace has him arrested, the actress reflected that it \\"is awful, not only has she lost her dad, she's lost the love of her life.\\" Trevor is released when Mercedes comes forward as his alibi, revealing they were having sex when Fraser was killed. Grace then becomes convinced Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) killed him. She kidnaps Ste and tries to force a confession out of him. Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) was later revealed to be Fraser's murderer to protect his family. Wood concluded that the story affected Grace's development. He told Kilkelly that \\"the big thing for Grace has been finding out about her dad's very dark side, as he completely denied her any love. Grace's life has been turned upside down as well.\\" =Wrecking ball stunt= One of Grace's first big stories was announced in December 2013. Grace threatens Freddie telling him that she will harm someone close to him if he does not kill Mercedes for her. He refuses and Grace follows through with her plan. Kilkelly (Digital Spy) reported that Hollyoaks had created a dramatic stunt involving a wrecking ball and a demolition of their council housing set. They added that Grace would trap a character in the disused flats ready for them to be killed in the demolition. Freddie's brother Joe was later revealed to be Grace's target. Hollyoaks released promotional pictures of the character being showered with debris from the demolition. Holloaks led viewers to believe that Joe had been killed off in the scenes. Fraser involved himself to ensure Grace was not reprimanded for the crime. He tells Grace that Joe died in the demolition and he disposed of the body. Writers played Grace being guilt ridden in the weeks of episodes that followed the stunt. Fraser decides to bring Grace in on a secret to ease her guilt. The show aired surprise scenes in which Fraser takes Grace to a private hospital where Joe is alive, but comatose and being cared for. Grace and Fraser were tasked with keeping Joe's location a secret after everyone believes he left the village. Joe's mother Sandy nearly discovers the secret after Fraser is careless. Then Joe wakes from his coma and Grace considers killing Joe to protect her freedom. Joe fakes amnesia and manages to escape from hospital. It soon becomes clear he has not lost any memories from the incident. Callaghan told Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap that \\"he remembers pretty much everything that happened to him at the hands of Grace.\\" He added that he wants to protect his mother Sandy, from the Black family now he knows about their crimes. Grace is arrested for the attempted murder of Joe and the case is sent to trial. Mercedes and Freddie become invested in watching Grace to make sure she does not get away with it. Grace is confident she will be found not guilty at the trial. Writers played the story to convey Grace having similar power to Fraser. Wall told Laura Withers of Inside Soap that her character has the \\"judge in her pocket\\" and pays to fix the trial. She explained that Grace uses skills learned from her father. Fraser taught her that people in power can be paid off. Mercedes discovers Grace's plan and attempts to ruin it. Wall claimed the story showed that Grace appears strong but is \\"actually prettified\\" about going to prison. The character avoids a prison sentence when the trial concludes. =Feud with Freddie Roscoe= Grace has a prominent feud with the character Freddie Roscoe. Freddie manages to secure his release after he receives a false alibi. Grace knows the alibi is false and is furious that Freddie has evaded justice. Wall told Withers that \\"Grace has been bent on revenge ever since she found out that Freddie killed her dad.\\" She was willing to forget her vendetta on the condition Freddie was sent to prison. But his release makes Grace \\"see red\\" and she wants a \\"showdown\\" with her nemesis. The actress said that at this point in the story Trevor is fed up with Grace and Freddie's feud. He issues an ultimatum that if she wants to start a family, she must leave Freddie alone. Grace ignores Trevor's warnings and she goes to confront him at her night club where they brawl on the outside balcony. Writers included a \\"deadly turn\\" in the story, where there fight escalates and Freddie knocks Grace over the balcony and she falls to the ground. Wall said that writers made in unclear to her whether Freddie did it intentionally or accidentally, but noted \\"it would certainly make life easier for Freddie if Grace were dead.\\" Hollyoaks hired a stunt double during filming as they could not expect Wall to perform a 12-foot fall. Grace has to become secretive about her revenge plans as not to upset Trevor who wants a normal family life. Wall commented \\"It's a bit of a tough situation for Grace, because she's stuck in the middle. She could either be the baddie and get revenge, or she could turn her back, let bygones be bygones and be a family woman.\\" Grace decides on a new revenge plot against Freddie. Mercedes disappears in mysterious circumstances and the police believe she has been murdered when they find traces of her blood. Flashback scenes aired revealed Grace was behind Mercedes' disappearance and she sets out to frame Freddie for her murder. She plant evidence in Freddie's flat so that he is arrested. Hollyoaks had been secretive about whether or not Mercedes had been killed by Grace. In February 2015, Mercedes reappeared on-screen in surprise scenes and it was revealed she had teamed up with Grace to frame Freddie for her supposed murder. The character had been hiding in a villa in France while Grace set Freddie up. Freddie's girlfriend Lindsey discovers the truth and sends Grace threatening messages to expose her deceit. Grace manages to fool the police investigation until Phoebe McQueen (Mandip Gill) incriminates herself into becoming the prime suspect for the supposed murder. With the plan ruined Mercedes later returns to the village. Hollyoaks released a promotional trailer of new storylines which featured Grace holding Freddie at gun point. Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that the story would bring Grace's feud with Freddie to an end. In addition they released pictures showing that Joe would also gain control of the gun and aim it at his estranged brother Freddie. Grace's motivation for wanting to kill Freddie comes from a series of events in which Kim ruins her relationship with Trevor and Esther. Clapham told Laura Withers (Inside Soap) that his character is \\"paralysed with fear\\" over Grace. He knows that Grace \\"has nothing to lose\\" now and may well kill him. When the scenes played out Joe manages to obtain the gun and tries to shoot Freddie. He misses but the stray bullet hits Phoebe who later dies. =Relationship with Trevor Royle= Hollyoaks created Grace's first relationship storyline alongside Trevor. The plot commenced on-screen December 2013 when the duo kissed for the first time. Grace becomes jealous of Trevor charming Mercedes in his attempts to con her. When Trevor confronts her jealous behaviour Grace admits she has romantic feelings for him and they get together. Grace and Trevor's relationship is forbidden by disapproving Fraser, and they see each other in secret. Freddie discovers their romance and tells Fraser about their betrayal. Wood told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) that it is love between Grace and Trevor \\"but in this murky world that they live in, they're not being able to fully express that love.\\" He said that it was a difficult situation for his character. He wants to keep out of prison so he can be with her. Wood described the relationship as a first for Trevor because he deeply cares and loves Grace unlike his previous romances. Wall hoped that Grace and Trevor would become the show's \\"new power couple\\". She wanted them to have a similar relationship to Den (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), a well known married couple from the rival soap opera EastEnders. Though she noted \\"Grace and Trevor are far more evil\\", her character believes her relationship is \\"the real deal\\" and Trevor is the only man she cares about. Grace's influence on Trevor is positive and allowed writers to showcase his \\"soft side\\". When sharing scenes the pair can be shown as quite pleasant characters, Wall said it \\"makes them more likeable, even though they are both baddies.\\" Fans of Hollyoaks labelled the couple \\"Trace\\" and the actress believed the relationship helped viewers warm to her character. According to Wood his character had long hankered for a sense of normality that other characters on the show have. He said that finding love had changed his character's priorities. Grace had become Trevor's main focus and the gangster business played second. In one story, Grace has Trevor arrested for her father's murder. Wood believed that Trevor was understanding of the betrayal because she was grieving. He added that Trevor's understanding was the reason they were able to move on in their relationship. Grace wants to begin a family but her doctor informs her the chances are low because of injuries sustained by a gun shot. She decides to try IVF treatment in order to conceive. She tells Trevor she wants to focus on a future that does not involve crime. Wall told an Inside Soap reporter that \\"Grace doesn't want to be evil any more.\\" She noted that Trevor had long wanted to change but Grace was \\"more stubborn about it\\". When Grace announced her intention to have IVF, Trevor is delighted. Wall said it was a \\"cute\\" moment for the couple because they are so happy. In 2015, producers built Grace and Trevor's family unit by introducing his son Dylan Jenkins (James Fletcher). His arrival sends their lives into disarray but Grace does try and make an effort with him. She agrees to go to his school parents evening, but dresses inappropriately. In comedic scenes Dylan is embarrassed by Grace's revealing outfit which attracts the attention of male students who begin wolf-whistling at her. Wall said \\"lets face it, Grace and Trevor are not your average parents, are they?\\" Writers plagued the duo with more relationship dramas such as Grace's affair with Kim and the introduction of Trevor's ex-girlfriend and Dylan's mother, Val Jenkins (Tanya Robb). When Grace makes a harsh comment regarding the death of Phoebe, Trevor is furious and they argue. Val uses the opportunity to spend time with Trevor helping him with house work. This makes Grace jealous, who views Val as a love-rival. Grace's concerns are proved correct Val kisses Trevor. Robb told an Inside Soap reporter that Val wants to give Dylan a \\"normal family life\\". She believed her character did not want to ruin Grace's relationship but thought it felt natural to try. Trevor does not reciprocate but Grace finds evidence of their kiss and it causes more problems for them. They also face another set back when Grace wrongly presumes Trevor has slept with Porsche McQueen (Twinnie-Lee Moore). Grace forces Trevor to take a lie detector test to prove his innocence. Wall said it was an example of her character behaving anxiously because she is about to achieve her dreams of a complete family. She does not want Trevor to ruin it by cheating, Wall added \\"She's probably quite worried all the time that he's going to go off with some beautiful, normal girl.\\" Trevor is arrested for a series of murders which occurred at the local hospital. He is wrongly accused as viewers knew that Lindsey was the serial killer, dubbed the \\"Gloved Hand Killer\\". Wall said her character knows Trevor better than anyone and knows he would not have committed these crimes. She sets out to prove his innocence but Lindsey is actively trying to frame Trevor. Wall likened Grace trying to complete a puzzle as she goes out to find clues that lead to the actual killer. Grace realises that Charlie Dean (Charlie Behan) knows something about the actual culprit. Wall said that Grace is true to form and behaves \\"very aggressive\\", kidnaps him and tries to force Charlie to talk. =Feud with Big Bob= Hollyoaks cast Vincent Ebrahim to play Big Bob, a villainous character created to cause conflict with Grace and Trevor. Big Bob arrives in the village to find Trevor and request a criminal favour. His arrival came at a time Grace wanted to begin IVF treatment. Wall told an Inside Soap reporter that Bib Bob's arrival meant \\"something pretty bad is going to happen\\". She added that it threw a \\"massive spanner in the works\\" and ruined Grace's attempts to move away from her life as a gangster. When Big Bob vandalises their home, Grace decides to force Lindsey into helping Big Bob smuggle a sim card into a nearby prison. As the plan failed, Big Bob wants revenge. Trevor finds a box with a lock of Grace's hair inside and then receives a threatening call from Big Bob. He tells Trevor he has kidnapped Grace and demands a ¬£60000 ransom for her safe release. But Grace is okay and they discover that Big Bob has kidnapped Esther after mistaking her identity. Grace and Trevor go on a rescue mission which ends with Big Bob pointing a gun in Grace's face. The story was part of the show's continued theme of playing Grace in dangerous situations. A Hollyoaks publicist stated that it was \\"more than just bad luck\\" and warned that Grace has a bad track record with guns. Big Bob later plan an armed robbery at the local hospital, targeting their medical supplies. The heist goes wrong and many characters end up held hostage in the hospital. Grace and Esther try to escape, but Esther collapses and goes into anaphylactic shock due to an allergic reaction to some antibiotics. Grace is tasked with saving Esther's life and correctly finds some adrenaline to save her life. Big Bob locates them and once again threatens Grace with a gun. =Friendship with Esther Bloom and surrogacy= Jazmine Franks (pictured) plays Grace's best friend Esther Bloom. After the siege Grace and Esther build a strong friendship. It was the relationship writers used to develop Grace's softer side. Wall viewed Grace and Esther's friendship as a completely \\"random\\" but \\"brilliant\\" pairing. She was happy with the progression of their friendly dynamic, which resulted in the two characters always looking after one another. The actress also believed it made both characters' stories take a \\"perfect\\" path. She also enjoyed working on the relationship because of Franks' funny personality. Grace is told she cannot get pregnant and IVF is unlikely to help. She then shows an interest in Esther's health and her sudden concern makes Esther suspicious. Grace asks Esther to be a surrogate mother for her and tries to bully her into helping. When Grace leaves Esther alone she agrees to help. Grace, Trevor and Esther attend a meeting at the hospital to discuss their plans. The doctor informs Grace that Esther would be the child's legal mother, despite using Grace's egg. Grace is not fazed but Trevor has some reservations. The surrogacy plan is successful and Esther becomes pregnant. Franks was surprised when producers pitched the storyline to her. She was happy to be trusted with the story and added that Esther is \\"too nice\\" and ultimately could not refuse to help Grace. The actress believed viewers that would have never imagined the three characters working together. Writers played scenes which sometimes threatened Grace's happiness. Early on in the pregnancy they created a medical scare for Esther. When she feels unwell Grace worries and rushes Esther to hospital. But after a check-up and scan the pregnancy is fine. Grace and Trevor witness Esther's ultrasound scan and see their baby for the first time. Wall said \\"it's lovely, it hits them that they're really going to have a child! There aren't very many warm moments in Grace and Trevor's lives, but this is definitely one of them.\\" Writers began developing a new romance for Esther while she carried Grace's child. Esther meets Kim Butterfield (Daisy Wood- Davis) who asks her on a date. Esther invites Grace along and Kim presumes they are in a relationship. Grace is privy to their misunderstanding and urges them to get together. Digital Spy's Kilkelly revealed that Grace would soon regret her decision. The character becomes worried that Esther and Kim's relationship will ruin their surrogacy deal. Grace tells Kim that Esther once tried to commit suicide to put Kim off. Esther confronts Grace when she realises that Kim has ended their relationship because of Grace's actions. Wall told Kilkelly that if Esther tried to keep the baby it would destroy their friendship. Esther gives birth to a baby boy named Curtis. She later bans Grace and Trevor from seeing the baby because of their behaviour. Franks defended her character's actions. She explained that Esther always knew the baby was for Grace but she has an unforeseen attachment to Curtis. Esther feels maternal to the baby and she had not expected it to happen when she first agreed to be a surrogate for Grace. Franks added that \\"she's scared that Trevor and Grace are not fit parents.\\" =Kim Butterfield's obsession= Producers created an infidelity story for Grace with Kim. A promotional trailer followed which showcased Kim's behaviour intensifying when she begins a diary about her interaction with Grace. Wood-Davis told Daniel Kilkelly that Kim notes down each time Grace touches her and even logs their conversations. She also keeps a picture of Grace hidden in her bra. The actress admitted Kim quickly became obsessed with Grace because \\"really sets her heart racing and she can't get her out of her mind.\\" She loves Esther but Grace brings danger into her life. Grace is sent to prison awaiting trial for her involvement in the supposed murder of Mercedes. Wall explained that her character refused to tell the truth about Mercedes being alive. She fears Esther will back out of their surrogacy deal if she knows that she carried on her feud with Freddie against her wishes. Kim begins to miss Grace, Wood-Davis told Carena Crawford from All About Soap that Kim is \\"one determined woman\\" and makes it her mission to join Grace in prison. She believes Grace is the only one to make her feel complete. Kim knows it is unlikely she will get the chance to be with Grace. So when she enters prison she schemes against Grace's cell mate Reenie McQueen (Z√∂e Lucker), resulting in Kim being moved into Grace's cell. Wood- Davis said that it marked the first time Grace became unnerved by Kim's behaviour. Wood-Davis viewed Kim and Grace as an \\"odd pairing and very unexpected\\" who bonded over their shared love of Esther. Grace is scared at the prospect of permanent imprisonment and feels vulnerable. She opens up to Kim about her deteriorating relationship with Trevor because she is someone familiar. But Kim uses this as an opportunity to seduce Grace who responds positively and the pair have sex. The development lead writers to play the Kim character even crazier over Grace, thinking she and Grace will be together upon their release from prison. Wood-Davis said Kim thinks \\"she's found a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\\" Wall told Sally Brockway from Soaplife Grace does not realise \\"how insane Kim is\\". Their tryst makes Grace feel powerful and she does not have feelings for Kim. Wall added that Grace knows Kim is attracted to her and it makes her feel good while in prison and have a \\"power-trip\\". The story had potential to ruin Grace's life and she worries that Esther will not give the baby up. Grace realises that Kim has more power over Esther. She fakes feelings of love for Kim and manipulates her into ensuring Esther is committed to the surrogacy deal. Wall branded Grace's scheme a \\"dangerous game\\" because she knows that Kim is \\"pretty much insane\\". But noted that Grace has dealt with worse people in her past, \\"far freakier, weirder people than Kim.\\" 160pxGrace soon struggles to control Kim and remain in a relationship with Trevor. Wood-Davis told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that Kim wants revenge when she discovers Grace is still having sex with Trevor. She prints out hundreds of pictures of herself and Grace kissing and plasters them on the walls of Grace's nightclub. She manages to remove them before Trevor and Esther arrive. Grace confronts Kim and realises how unstable she has become. She decides to keep Kim happy and stops arguing and sleeps with her. However the pair are caught in bed together by Trevor's son Dylan. Grace's problems worsen when Kim turns on Esther and starts plotting against her. Wood-Davis explained \\"Kim reckons that once the baby is born, the two of them can run off into the sunset with the child.\\" This results in Kim spiking Esther's drink with labour inducing drugs to gain her happy ending with Grace. Writers introduced Trevor into the story who decides to help Grace ride of Kim. He orders Robbie Roscoe (Charlie Wernham) to kill Kim but the plan fails and she refuses to leave. Esther discovers the truth about the affair, she refuses to forgive Grace and once again threatens that Grace will not be part of the surrogate child's life. Grace and Kim's affair resulted in Wood-Davis receiving angry comments on social media website Twitter. Fans expressed their support for \\"Trace\\" relationship and blamed Kim for trying to split them up. =Car crash stunt= Hollyoaks released a trailer with advance spoilers revealing that Kim would orchestrate a car chase amongst the escalated drama surrounding Esther's surrogacy. The car chase was filmed using stunt drivers placed on top of the vehicles and pod cameras attached to them. This allowed the actors to act as though they were driving the vehicle despite the stunt man being in control. The car which contains Kim and Esther was crashed using a police van which collides with it. The car crash stunt itself was filmed separate and actors were not required to be in the vehicles at that point. Real fire, smoke, fire engines and fire fighters were included in the scenes to help create an authentic scene of mayhem during the post-crash scenes. On- set Wood-Davis said that Kim \\"is the driving force of it really.\\" She explained that Kim realised Grace did not want her and she decided to run off with Curtis in an act of revenge. The storyline was played out on-screen following Esther giving birth to Grace's son, Curtis. Kim returns to the village and asks Esther to take Curtis and leave the village with her. She reveals that Trevor and Grace tried to kill her. Wood explained to Jonathon Hughes of All About Soap that Trevor cannot stand Kim and Grace's affair continuing any longer. He put a stop to it and this leads Kim too gain revenge by taking his son away from him. The character tries to trick Esther into believing Kim has left the village. Franks told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that Esther knows Trevor is lying and is the reason she agrees to take Curtis. Trevor and Grace follow Kim's car and a fast chase begins. But their erratic driving leads to a crash and Trevor arrives on the scene to save Curtis. But then Kim reverses her car which leads to another collision with a police van which leads to the death of Dylan, who was in the van. The car which contained Kim and Esther explodes following their escape. Wall said the car crash stunt was her favourite storyline from Grace's tenure. She told Hooper (Closer) that \\"it was literally the most fun I‚Äôve had whilst I‚Äôve been here. It‚Äôs Grace at her absolute maddest. When I watched it back and saw my facial expressions, I couldn‚Äôt have looked any uglier if I tried! It‚Äôs nice being outside on location and doing things that are a little bit different.\\" She also believed that the crash and Dylan's subsequent death was \\"kind of Grace's fault\\". The crash was named one of \\"the best bits of August\\" in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2016. =Casual relationships= In 2015, the character spent an episodic block separated from Trevor. The pair break up because Trevor blames Grace for Dylan's death in the car crash stunt. During this time Hollyoaks writers began a casual sexual relationship between Grace and Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson). When Grace and Esther repair their friendship, Esther develops romantic feelings towards her. It was reported by Digital Spy that Esther would have \\"fresh hope\\" of a romance with Grace when Darren ends their brief relationship. When Grace confides in Esther about her \\"disastrous love life\\", she sees the opportunity to reveal her feelings and surprises Grace with a kiss. Grace and Esther begin a relationship but soon develop problems. Grace has second thoughts about being with Esther because she still loves Trevor. With Trevor in prison Esther feels confident their relationship can succeed. But Esther's happiness is short-lived when she finds Grace's old engagement ring. All About Soap's Laura Morgan reported that Grace would feel guilty and try to prove to Esther she has moved on from Trevor. But when Esther finds evidence to support Trevor was wrongly arrested for murder she is forced to hand the evidence to the police and secure his release. Writers brought the brief relationship to and end with Trevor's release. =Wedding and Trevor's death= 160pxHollyoaks planned a wedding storyline for Grace and Trevor. When they reconcile on-screen the pair set about organising their nuptials. Writers also developed an affair storyline for Trevor and Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) to coincide with the wedding. The latter is due to marry Trevor's enemy Ben Bradley (Ben Richards). They visit each other in secret and concoct a plan to run away together. Kilkelly reported that Grace and Sienna's wedding preparations would see them turn into \\"bridezillas\\" clashing with one another over dresses. Viewers were divided over their support for each relationship as both pairing proved popular. Trevor and Sienna were given the fan worship name \\"Trienna\\" pitted against \\"Trace\\" fans. Wall told Alison Gardner from What's on TV that Grace feels \\"jittery\\" in the days before her wedding because she is thinks Trevor is having an affair. Grace is terrified that she will be jilted. She described a pivotal scene in the story in which Grace and Trevor discuss her childhood dreams. Wall explained that Grace opens up about her wedding day being all she had ever dreamed of growing up. She also pleads with him to not ruin her day. British paparazzi had acquired photographs of on location filming which appeared to suggest a funeral for Trevor was imminent. The reports were accurate as Grace's wedding episode was broadcast. Trevor decides that he wants to be with Grace. Sienna's daughter Nico Blake (Persephone Swales-Dawson) discovered Trevor's affair. The murderess character is furious with Trevor for ruining her family unit with Ben. She approaches Trevor outside the church and stabs him before fleeing the scene. Trevor recalls his promise to not let Grace down on her wedding day. He gains composure, hides his stabbing wound and enters the church to complete the wedding ceremony. They manage to marry, but Trevor collapses and dies at the altar. Grace is \\"grief-stricken\\" by Trevor's death and Ben tells police he murdered Trevor to protect Nico. Following his murder Grace refuses to take off her wedding dress and remains in it for several episodes. Filming Grace's grief was Wall's most challenging story during her tenure because it involved playing Grace \\"down\\" for prolonged time. She explained \\"the aftermath of Trevor's death was hard because it involved peeling back every layer of Grace, to the point where she had nothing. She didn't take her wedding dress off for a week!\\" The actress added that she was unsure Grace would ever discover Nico actually killed her husband. Writers kept the affair secret until Trevor's funeral episode in which Sienna is exposed as his former lover. Grace angrily confronts Sienna about the betrayal. This ignited a new feud storyline which writers continued to explore over the months of episodes that followed. When Grace later discovers a portrait of Sienna that Trevor drew, it reignites her hatred towards Sienna. =Introduction of family= In 2016, producers created an extended family for Grace. First they cast the roles of half-brothers Liam (Maxim Baldry), Jesse (Luke Jerdy) and Adam Donovan (Jimmy Essex). It was revealed that on-screen Grace would not be happy with them being in her life again. During the casting process the three actors had to complete a day long acting workshop with Wall. They conversed about Grace's history within Hollyoaks to help with their introduction to the show. Liam is introduced to the show first. Grace is annoyed when she notices him and gives him money to leave the village for good. Esther decides that Grace needs family support following Trevor's murder. She decides to invite the Donovans to visit Grace. When they arrive she orders them to leave, but they persist on staying. Jerdy told Laura Heffernan (Inside Soap) that ultimately Grace views them as her \\"little annoying brothers\\" who have never had any time for her. They give her a cosmetic make-over and begin to lift her mood. Liam and Jesse soon plot to steal Trevor's life insurance to repay money they owe Adam. Jerdy told Kilkelly that Jesse and Liam were influenced by Adam's estranged relationship with Grace. They had a problematic dynamic and his negative stories about Grace clouded their judgement. Jerdy believed that Jesse feels guilty about the scam because he is the first brother to care about Grace. He noted that Liam has a \\"colder\\" personality and does not feel any remorse for trying to scam his sister. In August 2016, it was announced that Lisa Maxwell had joined the cast of Hollyoaks in the role of Grace's mother Tracey. The character was billed as a \\"train wreck\\" who has had a difficult life. Her relationship with Grace is difficult and they are estranged. Maxwell had to have a \\"make-under\\" to make her appear older. This was to add realism because of the mere thirteen year age gap between Wall and Maxwell. Grace's resentment for Tracey began when she left her two daughters in the care of Fraser. Grace and Clare were brought up in a world of \\"crime and corruption\\" that came with Fraser. But Tracey remarried and brought up Adam, Jesse, and Liam with different values. A publicist for the show stated \\"Tracey adds an interesting dynamic to the Donovans. Lisa enjoyed filming and bosses think the audience will love her scenes with Tamara.\\" Reception For her portrayal of Grace, Wall was nominated in the \\"Best Bitch\\" category at the 2014 Inside Soap Awards. At the 2016 ceremony, she was nominated for \\"Funniest Female\\" and \\"Best Actress\\". She and Wood gained a \\"Best Partnership\\" nomination for their work on Grace and Trevor's relationship. In August 2017, Wall was longlisted for Best Bad Girl at the Inside Soap Awards. She made the viewer-voted shortlist, although lost out to Gillian Kearney, who portrays Emma Barton in Emmerdale. Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) described Grace as a \\"no-nonsense and strong-minded businesswoman\\" with a penchant for kidnapping people. The critic praised Hollyoaks writers for the \\"stroke of genius\\" pairing Grace and Trevor. He opined that they had \\"irresistible chemistry\\" and \\"fans unexpectedly found themselves rooting for the show's resident criminal couple.\\" He later branded her the \\"ruthless\\" and \\"fearsome Hollyoaks gangster Grace Black.\\" Their colleague Phoebe Roy said that the \\"grandest day-glo fembot\\" mellowed after she became a mother, but did retain \\"some of her old fury\\". They likened the addition of marriage and motherhood onto Grace was \\"like de-clawing a mighty lion ‚Äì even her hair is smaller.\\" Penny McGuire from What's on TV branded Grace the \\"village bad girl\\" and a fellow writer from the magazine labelled her a \\"ruthless\\" character. Jess Denham of The Independent reported that Hollyoaks sometimes gets labelled \\"too gay\\" by viewers because of their many sexuality related storylines, citing Grace seducing Kim for personal gain as an example. Carena Crawford from All About Soap questioned whether or not the character was stupid. She noted that Grace fell for Kim's scheming and warned her to steer clear of the character. She later praised Wall's performance alongside Passey. She enjoyed watching their characters, Grace and Sienna fight. They also expressed their want of a reformed friendship between the two and gave them the portmanteau \\"Grienna\\". A writer from Inside Soap liked the extremes Grace went to in order to destroy Esther's wedding. They added \\"You have to hand it to Grace Black, she doesn't do things by half.\\" They also \\"rooted\\" for the character to win the feud with Freddie and observed that she walks around Hollyoaks village \\"like she owns it\\". Michael Cregan from the publication enjoyed Hollyoaks portraying a \\"softer side\\" to Grace during the hospital siege story. But the writer had become bored of Grace being nice to Esther, and were glad \\"the bitch is back\\". They added \\"we love seeing Tamara Wall having fun, as Grace returns to her evil old ways.\\" Inside Soap writers have described her as having an \\"enormous hairdo\\", being \\"tough on the outside\\" and headed for heartache with Trevor. They quipped \\"if there‚Äôs one thing scarier than Grace Black, it‚Äôs Grace trying to be nice.\\" The critic later opined that Grace and Trevor's wedding was the most shocking nuptial ever featured on a soap opera. The writer also noted that \\"the villainous pair have made their share of enemies over the years.\\" They praised Wall and Passey's \\"heartbreaking\\" performances following Trevor's death. But Laura Withers was dismissed the character as a \\"heartless gangster\\" and branded Kim's obsession \\"bonkers\\".

For many years, she was the mistress of Isaac Levitan and served as the inspiration for the lead character in a short story by Anton Chekhov: –ü–æ–ø—Ä—ã–≥—É–Ω—å—è (The Grasshopper, 1892). In 1955, it was adapted for the screen as the first movie directed by Samson Samsonov, with Lyudmila Tselikovskaya in the starring role.  Biography  Dr. Kuvshinnikov (from The Hunters at Rest by Vasily Perov) She was born to the family of a minor civil servant. After an education which stressed the fine arts, she married Dr Dmitri Kuvshinnikov, a doctor for the police department who was much older.Brief Biography @ –ó–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç—ã–µ –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω—ã. In 1871, he appeared as one of the figures in a painting by Vasily Perov (\\"The Hunters at Rest\\").\\"Who are the Hunters at Rest?\\" by Yuri Volgin @ the Chuvash Republic website. This was exhibited at a showing by the Peredvizhniki and, afterwards, his modest apartment became a gathering place for the creative community; a group which came to include Levitan and the Chekhovs. Portrait by Levitan (1888) Sofia acted as hostess and, for many, was considered one of the chief attractions there. She not only played piano and sewed costumes, she often went out hunting, dressed as a man, and brought back a full bag of game. In 1886, the Chekhov brothers introduced Levitan to the Kuvshinnikovs. Levitan considered himself to be a \\"ladies' man\\" and he soon fixed his sights on Sofia, although she was thirteen years his senior. Often, he would bring his art materials and paint while she played piano. In 1888 he, Sofia, and Alexei Stepanov took a steam trip on the Volga. They found themselves attracted to the town of Plyos and decided to stay. They remained until 1890. It was there she studied with him and improved her amateur painting skills.Biographical notes and works from the Museum of Landscape, Plyos. thumb|300px|Landscape with Church, near Plyos by Kuvshinnikova - 1893 The Grasshopper dates from shortly after this time. Chekhov published the story in ' (North), issues one and two of January 1892.Muratova, K. D. Commentaries to –ü–æ–ø—Ä—ã–≥—É–Ω—å—è. The Works by A.P. Chekhov in 12 volumes. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura. Moscow, 1960. Vol. 7, pp. 516-517 The story concerns a lecherous man who has an affair with a married woman, whose husband dies of an accident (that may have been suicide) after she leaves him. Levitan and Kuvshinnikova were both offended although the central figure in the story was a young wife and Kuvshinnikova was 42. Moreover she was dark haired and a talented painter, whereas Chekhov's character was blonde and not an artist. The stronger similarity was that her husband was tolerant of her disloyalty to him, as was \\"The Grasshopper\\" who forgave his wife's indiscretions. She, Levitan and her husband travelled together and were considered a m√©nage a trois. Chekhov was a close friend of Sofia's and may have had strong affections for her. The story was a way of criticizing her betrayal, both of him and her innocent husband, and created a small scandal. According to the memoirs of Chekhov's brother, Mikhail, the situation almost led to a duel with Levitan, but it was avoided thanks to the intercession of a mutual friend, Tatiana Shchepkina-Kupernik.\\"Why, because of his beloved, did Levitan almost call a duel with Chekhov?\\" by Vladimir Rogoza @ –®–∫–æ–ª–∞ –ñ–∏–∑–Ω–∏. Nevertheless she and Chekhov were no longer friends. Her husband's understanding was illustrated in the help he later gave to Levitan who, being Jewish, found himself and his family expelled from the city. It was Dr. Kuvshinnikov who interceded with the authorities to allow his wife's lover to return. It is unclear if there was ever a formal separation from her husband but, in 1894, she and Levitan settled at an estate on Lake Ostrovno in Tver Oblast. Before long, he began another affair with a younger woman from a neighboring estate and she returned to Moscow. They reconciled and broke up twice more; in 1895 and 1897. From then on, she pursued her own career as a painter and maintained friendships with numerous artists, writers and performers. In August 1907, she was visiting friends at an estate near Moscow, when she fell ill with dysentery and died.Obituary @ –ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π.

History In 1990, Morrison delivered a series of three lectures at the William E.

The book's three chapters are \\"Black Matters\\",Morrison, Toni (October 8, 1993), \\"Black matters: Toni Morrison is the new Nobel laureate for literature. Here, we print an extract from her writing on whiteness and the literary imagination\\". The Independent. \\"Romancing the Shadow\\", and \\"Disturbing Nurses and the Kindness of Sharks\\". Subject matter Writing in the journal Signs, Linda Krumholz described Morrison's project as \\"reread[ing] the American literary canon through an analysis of whiteness to propose the ways that black people were used to establish American identity.\\" Reviewing Playing in the Dark in The New York Times in 1992, Wendy Steiner said: \\"The moral and emotional force of [Morrison's] explorations is apparent. If the American identity is formed against this black shadow, it is a sign of abject weakness and a cause for shame....The genius of Ms. Morrison's approach is to enlist those very describers and imaginers‚Äîwhite men of letters‚Äîin an investigation that can end only in their self-indictment.\\" But, Steiner added, \\"it is also not a mere denunciation of white culture. Instead, it is a self-help project meant both to map out new critical territory and to rearrange the territory within.\\" Michael Eric Dyson observes that in addition to this exploration of the \\"white literary imagination...Playing in the Dark is also about a black intellectual seizing the interpretive space within a racially ordered hierarchy of cultural criticism. Blacks are usually represented through the lens of white perception rather than the other way around...With [Playing in the Dark], a substantial change is portended.\\" Reception In 2016, Time magazine noted that Playing in the Dark was among Morrison's most-assigned texts on U.S. college campuses, together with several of her novels and her 1993 Nobel Prize lecture, making her one of the most-assigned of all female writers.

The satellite was designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin Space on the LM-2100 platform, and was launched on 18 February 2020 on an Ariane 5. The satellite mainly provides service to Japan and the surrounding regions. Utilizing several S-band transponders with a flexible processor, the satellite has the capability to redirect communications capacity to concentrate on disaster relief efforts or other high-volume events.  History  On 3 February 2016, SKY Perfect JSAT awarded Lockheed Martin Space Systems a contract to build JCSAT-17 using a modernized variant of the A2100 satellite bus. Eventually, this bus became known as LM-2100, which is expected to provide JCSAT-17 with a minimum 15-year lifespan. On 4 January 2017, SKY Perfect JSAT announced it had contracted Arianespace to launch JCSAT-17 on an Ariane 5 ECA. The satellite was shipped to Kourou in January 2020.  Spacecraft  JCSAT-17 was built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems on the LM-2100 platform. The spacecraft uses an 18-metre reflecting antenna to provide targeted S-band communications to Japan and surrounding regions.https://www.arianespace.com/wp- content/uploads/2020/02/VA252-launchkit-EN2.pdf - 18 February 2020 Once in orbit, the new satellite unfurled a 18-metre-diameter S-band mesh communications antenna made by L3Harris Technologies, formerly known as Harris Corp., of Melbourne, Florida. The spacecraft uses Ku-band transceivers for aircraft avionics communications.  Launch  JCSAT-17 was launched from Guiana Space Centre ELA-3 on 18 February 2020 at 22:19:00 UTC aboard an Ariane 5 ECA launch vehicle. As with most Ariane 5 missions, the satellite was co- manifested and therefore shared a launch with the South Korean weather satellite GEO-KOMPSAT 2B. Approximately 31 minutes after launch, JCSAT-17 separated from the SYLDA fairing and was released into geostationary transfer orbit. The S-band and C-band payloads on JCSAT-17 will be used by NTT Docomo, a Japanese mobile phone company, to provide mobile connectivity across Japan and surrounding regions, according to Sky Perfect JSAT.

At the age of 14 he ran away to work on the railways, before moving to Bulawayo, where he became involved in the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union (ICU), and worked with figures like 'Sergeant' Masotsha Ndlovu. The ICU, a radical trade union, started in South Africa in 1919, but spread into neighboring colonies in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1929 Mzingeli was sent to Harare Township at Salisbury (now Harare) as the ICU‚Äôs organizing secretary. The ICU disintegrated in South Africa as well as in Southern Rhodesia in the 1930s, but it had pioneered black trade unionism in the latter, where it had played a major role in both urban and rural protests.Terence Ranger, 1970, The African Voice in Southern Rhodesia, 1898‚Äì1930. Evanston: Northwestern University Press, pp. 150-169 Mzigeli remained politically active, developing connections with the South African Communist Party and the short-lived Communist Party of Southern Rhodesia, which was associated with Doris Lessing.Lucien van der Walt, 2007, 'The First Globalisation and Transnational Labour Activism in Southern Africa: White Labourism, the IWW and the ICU, 1904-1934', African Studies, volume 66, numbers 2/3, p. 243, online at http://abahlali.org/files/ICU.pdf In the early 1940s he became involved with the Southern Rhodesian Labour Party, which had recently opened its doors to blacks. In 1945, following a massive strike by black railway workers, Mzingeli relaunched the ICU as the Reformed Industrial Commercial Union (RICU), which was an important force in Harare into the 1950s, campaigning for black township residents, and reaching 7,000 members. From the mid-1950s, however. Mzingelu was increasingly challenged by hard-line nationalists associated with the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress.Timothy Scarnecchia, 2008, The Urban Roots of Democracy and Political Violence in Zimbabwe: Harare and Highfield, 1940-1964, Rochester, NY: Rochester University Press pp. 69-113 This current, which was carried over into the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), and then the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) breakaway (today the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU‚ÄìPF)) viewed rivals like Mizingeli as 'sell- outs'. It did not hesitate to use violence against opponents, and Mzingeli was forced out of politics. Mzingeli was politically marginalised in the 1960s and 1970s by the nationalists, and died in 1980.B.

The work was commissioned by the German music club Musica Femina M√ºnchen. It was first performed by the Munich Chamber Orchestra conducted by Christoph Poppen in Munich on May 27, 2004. The music is composed in a single movement and has a duration of roughly 35 minutes. Composition The music is based on the murder ballad of \\"The Twa Sisters,\\" sometimes known as \\"The Cruel Sister.\\" The narrative tells of two sisters courted by the same man. One sister is consumed by jealousy and pushes the other into the sea to her death. A group of minstrels later find her body on the shore and fashion a harp from her breastbone. Those same minstrels later play at the sororicidal sister's wedding and as the music reaches the bride's ears, the song concludes, \\"And surely now her tears will flow.\\" Wolfe was first introduced to the story in college when she heard a 1970 rendition of the ballad by the British band Pentangle. \\"While there are no musical references to the original tune,\\" Wolfe later wrote, \\"the story of the ballad inspired a response.\\" She added, \\"The ballad is incredibly haunting and powerful. I was fascinated and horrified by the overwhelming greed and jealousy of the tale. My Cruel Sister is a search to unravel this human dilemma. In a sense, it is the music of 'the harp,' a plea for a higher love.\\" Reception Cruel Sister has received a positive response from music critics. Andrew Clements of The Guardian called it \\"a striking half-hour showpiece for strings alone, which moves from menace to an uneasy calm, and then to a pizzicato-led coda.\\" Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times further remarked: References Compositions by Julia Wolfe 2004 compositions Compositions for string orchestra Commissioned music ","title":"Cruel Sister (Wolfe)"},{"id":"51278586","text":"Elisabeta »òtirbey (1805-1874), was a princess consort of Wallachia.Oana Marinache, Re»ôedin»õele »òtirbey din Bucure»ôti »ôi Buftea, Editura ACS, Bucure»ôti, 2013 She was the daughter of Elenei Br√¢ncoveanu (1787-1809) and Grigore Cantacuzino-Pa»ôcanu (1779-1808) and married Barbu Dimitrie »òtirbei in 1821.

French service Na√Øade was built to a plan by Pierre-Agustin Lamothe and was the name ship of her three-vessel class. The Royal Navy captured one sister ship, Diligente, in 1800 and employed her as a 14-gun transport until they sold her in 1814. =French Revolutionary Wars= The French Navy employed Na√Øade to patrol and escort convoys between Ouessant and Socoa. She then escorted a convoy between Ostend and Dunkirk. Lastly, she cruised in the North Sea and the Pas-de-Calais. Then she was stationed at Flessingue. During this time she was first under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Julien (24 February 1794 to 17 May 1794), and then lieutenant de vaisseau L√©onard (1-22 December 1794).Fonds Marine, p. 75. =Napoleonic Wars= At some point Na√Øade transferred to the Caribbean.

Six days later HMS Princess Charlotte was off Tobago when she sighted them in the distance. The two French vessels were too far away for Princess Charlotte to chase them. Captain George Tobin of Princess Charlotte decided to disguise his vessel as best he could in the hope that he could lure them to approach. He was successful and an engagement ensued. Eventually, Princess Charlotte succeeded in capturing Cyane, which had been a Royal Navy sloop until the French had captured her in May; Na√Øade as Tobin put it, \\"by taking a more prudent Situation and superior sailing, effected her Escape without any apparent Injury.\\" Capture On 13 October 1805 captured Naiade off Barbados () after a chase of nine hours. She was pierced for 22 guns, but mounted sixteen 12-pounder guns and four brass 2-pounder swivels.

The episode was written by Sean Calder, and was directed by Tawnia McKiernan. Plot Opening quote: \\"Tell me O'Muse, from whatsoever source you may know them.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) meets with Hank (Russell Hornsby), who has returned from his vacation with his ex-wife. Hank has torn his Achilles tendon on a zip line. They hear gunshots across the street and Nick goes to investigate, finding an author dead and a man, Anton Cole (Brian Gant), shooting, trying to leave with a woman, Khloe Sedgwick (Nora Zehetner). Nick chases Anton but Anton jumps into a river, escaping. Nick and the police question Khloe, who states that the author was her boyfriend and Anton is her ex. She then kisses Nick's hand in gratitude. Finding Anton's address, the police arrive and find he had an obsession with Khloe. Nick then gets a call from Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch), who is inviting him to dinner, which he accepts. Nick visits Khloe to check on her and she kisses him, revealing she is a Wesen named Musai. When Nick arrives for dinner with Juliette, it does not go well as Nick keeps thinking and having hallucinations of Khloe, prompting him to leave before eating. He goes with Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), behaves out of character and then leaves to go to a bar. Monroe calls Hank to talk to Nick about it. Hank meets with Nick in the bar and finds Nick drawing an image of Khloe woged form. A person tries to take it, and Nick attacks him and leaves. Monroe and Hank take Rosalee (Bree Turner) to the trailer in an attempt to find a cure for Nick. They find that the kiss of a Musai causes an addiction that could end with death. Past victims include Vincent van Gogh. The only cure may be true love. Anton makes a painting of Khloe in streets, dragging Nick's attention. Juliette arrives at the spice shop and meets Rosalee and Monroe, stating she now believes Nick's claims of the Wesen world and the Grimms and asks for explanations. Rosalee tells her that she may be the key to Nick's condition. Nick goes to Khloe's house, where she manipulates him into trying to kill Anton, who is there, to prove his love for her. Nick attacks Anton until the police arrive but, as he continues punching him after the arrest, he is restrained by Renard (Sasha Roiz). In the station, Nick goes to Anton's cell to kill him but is stopped by Monroe, Renard and Juliette. Juliette manages to stop Khloe's influence and Nick hugs her. Renard visits Khloe in the interview room and tells her to leave Portland forever and threatens her with his Zauberbiest form to prove his point.

This was a 2% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 5.77 million viewers with a 1.9/5.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"A-\\" grade and wrote, \\"An episode like 'Kiss Of The Muse,' one of the best examples of the kind of compelling, consistent genre show Grimm can be at its best, always reminds me that it was the first overall pick in Grantland's cancellation draft. Almost nobody gave this show a real chance, and yet, with modest success compared to the rest of the NBC lineup, it earned enough survival time to work out its problems and develop a solid group of characters. Now, here it is, stringing together a streak of strong episodes, on the verge of falling right in line behind David Greenwalt's previous successes on Angel. It's a familiar formula, but that doesn't diminish how damn entertaining this show can be when it all comes together in the right way.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.7 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Well, that was underwhelming. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but something that low key to drag Nick out of his kiss of the crazy certainly wasn't it.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"Khloe looked like a close-enough-approximation-but-not-carbon-copy-of the creatures from Avatar, right?

Biography  Altshuler was born in a family of Jewish intellectuals in Moscow. His father Vladimir Aleksandrovich Altshuler (1882‚Äì1965) was a lawyer and former revolutionary who worked at the Soviet Ministry of Finances. Altshuler had a brother Sergei (1909‚Äì1979) and a sister Olga (1912‚Äì1992). In 1932 he started working at the X-ray Laboratory of the Moscow Machine Building Institute. Two years later he enrolled to the Moscow State University, graduating in 1936. Being a specialist in properties of metals and an aviation engineer, he was sent to the Soviet Army in 1940, but in 1942 recalled from the front to the laboratories of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. During those World War II years he defended a PhD (1943) and developed a pulsed X-ray radiography method for real-time analysis of damage induced by a projectile to the tank armor, receiving the State Prize for this work in 1946. The same year he was assigned to the Soviet atomic bomb project. Between 1946 and 1969 he worked at the Soviet Nuclear Center Arzamas-16 under top secret conditions, defending a habilitation in 1954. His administrative promotions were hampered by his outspoken nature, as he publicly opposed some official views and policies. In 1969 he returned to Moscow, assuming a position of department head at the Institute of Optical-Physical Measurements. Twenty years later he became a Chief Researcher at the Institute for High Energy Densities of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In his late years Altshuler published several books and articles on high-pressure science and on the history of the Soviet Atomic Project. Altshuler was married to Mariya Speranskaya (1916‚Äì1977); they had three sons: Boris (b. 1939), Aleksandr (b. 1945) and Mikhail (b. 1955). Boris became a notable physicist and besides his scientific research published a series of historical books related to Andrei Sakharov, his father and the Soviet atomic bomb project.

As a voice actor, he dubbed the voices of many actors.Cronologia fondamentale dell'epoca d'oro del doppiaggio italiano Dagli albori agli anni 1970 (in Italian) He was the official Italian voice of Sean Connery until his death in 1994. Other actors he dubbed included Tony Curtis, Roger Moore, Charles Bronson, Terence Hill, Sidney Poitier, Jean-Paul Belmondo and many more. Because Locchi was Sean Connery's official voice actor, he was the primary Italian voice of James Bond. Locchi continued to dub Bond while he was portrayed by George Lazenby and Roger Moore. In his animated film roles, he performed the Italian voices of characters in Disney animated feature films. He was the voice of Baloo the Bear in the 1967 film The Jungle Book and Little John in the 1973 film Robin Hood (Both characters were voiced by Phil Harris). He also voiced King Triton in the Italian dub of The Little Mermaid.PINO LOCCHI, la voce di James Bond enciclopediadeldoppiaggio.it Locchi's daughter Marina Locchi works as a theater actress.

She performed at major folk festivals and clubs across North America. Early years Lang was born in 1942 to a musical family in east end Montreal. She learned about singing and storytelling around the family‚Äôs kitchen table and started performing publicly at age 10 with her family in a revue called ‚ÄúThe Irish and Canadian Musical Revue‚Äù that played legion halls, theaters, hospitals and prisons. In her late teens, Lang got caught up in the folk revival. Career In 1963, at age 21, Lang became a professional folksinger and worked initially at the Caf√© Andr√©, a venue near the McGill University campus, for three years. She quickly became a star on the Montreal folk scene, filling the club every night with a loyal returning audience drawn by her effective guitar-playing, throaty voice, and most of all by her astonishing ability to connect with the people she was singing to. Lang moved on to become a touring artist, playing major folk festivals like Mariposa and Philadelphia and legendary clubs like Gerde‚Äôs Folk City in New York City, Caff√® Lena in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., the Riverboat in Toronto and Le Hibou in Ottawa. Her powerful interpretations and originals in folk, blues, country, and gospel gained her a large and devoted following. Her songs are emotionally powerful observations of the human condition, sometimes poignant, sometimes hilarious, mostly memorable. A major highlight of her career was her 1970 sold-out concert at Th√©√¢tre Port Royal at Place des Arts in Montreal. After an extended time away from professional life living in Morin Heights, a small village in the Laurentian Mountains where she raised her son Jason, she returned to full-time performing and was welcomed back to an adoring public. She returned to the studio in 1989 and recorded nine well- received albums for the She-Wolf, Festival and Borealis labels and toured Australia, Italy, Denmark, France and the United Kingdom. Death Penny died on July 31, 2016 at her home in Madeira Park on British Columbia‚Äôs Sunshine Coast, where she had been living since 2005. Legacy Penny shared a lifetime's familiarity with folk, blues, gospel and country songs with audiences and friends wherever she went and will be fondly remembered for her work on the concert stage. Her intimate performances were filled with laughter, tears and a bonding with the audience to create a community through song. Honors and awards Penny‚Äôs story was the subject of the 1999 documentary Stand Up: On High Ground with Penny Lang by Jocelyne Clarke, which premiered at the Silver Images Film Festival in Chicago. She received the first Prix Folqui awarded by FOLQUEBEC in 2003. Lang's 2001 album, Gather Honey, was nominated for a JUNO Award.

She currently lives in Los Angeles. Miller is best known as a performer in the heavy metal band Gwar during its formative years between 1986-1987 and for her fine and street art \\"Global Angel Wings Project.\\" Starting in 2012 to lift the spirits of people on the streets, Miller has created and installed angel wings in countries ranging from Kenya to Mexico to Cuba to France to Australia, earning her international and critical renown. In 2015, an image of a soldier walking in front of the artist's wings in Juarez, Mexico was featured in Reuters and BBC News as the international photograph of the day.  Early history  Miller's mother grew up in Holland and Indonesia and her father in the United States. As a result, the artist has always been globally aware and engaged in international dialogues.  Gwar (1986-1987)  While Miller was studying fine art at Virginia Commonwealth University, a group of local art students formed the now infamous punk metal band Gwar, shortly after which Miller became a member. The economic climate of the Reagan administration was starting to instill rebellion in the younger arts community and Gwar was a byproduct of that time. Between 1986 and 1987, Miller performed in the band under the names \\"Gwar Girl\\" and \\"Amazina.\\" This character she developed was an empowered female warrior unlike the sexualized woman stereotype that was prevalent during the 1980s. At the time, the formative band members were living in an old dairy plant that had been converted into lofts and artists studios which they called \\"The Milk Bottle\\". It was, as Miller describes, \\"a huge castle brimming with creative energy.\\" During her time performing with Gwar, Miller participated in several iconic skits, including: creating a giant RAID can to exterminate the only surviving creature from the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the USSR: a giant cockroach; a commercial for Gwar cereal; and an ironic installation featured around an oversized pair of Adolf Hitler's underwear.  The Global Angel Wings Project (2012-ongoing)  Miller moved to Los Angeles in 1999 and began her Global Angel Wings Project in 2012 to \\"remind humanity that we are the angels on this Earth.\\" One day she was depressed and stuck in gridlock freeway traffic and began to imagine how much better the sterile buildings around her would be with angel wings on them. The idea behind the wings wasn't specifically because she was living in Los Angeles, nicknamed the City of Angels, but was more about creating something uplifting for humanity as a whole. Miller selects neighborhoods throughout the world that need some moral uplifting since, as she explains, \\"the image of wings as enlightenment, hope, freedom, purity, and flight would be a good thing people to see and be a part of.\\" Miller installs her wings at eye-level, encouraging viewers to interact with the design and step in between them. This has launched an outpouring on social media with people taking photographs of themselves in various poses as the angel in between her wings. Miller has been included in lists of \\"The Most Instagram-Worthy Spots in L.A.\\" on BuzzFeed and Los Angeles Magazine, among others. Colette Miller has over 600,000 Instagram images [cite needed] = TEDx Talk = In 2015, Miller delivered a TEDx Talk entitled \\"Are We the Angels of the Earth?\\" in Culver City, California.

And he became the national champion after defeating Anil Mann in the final of the 96 kg freestyle event, although he could not defend his title in the next year ‚Äì finishing with a bronze medal. He made his international debut at senior level in the 2009 Asian Wrestling Championships, finishing eighth. In the 2009 Asian Junior Championship, he lost in the quarter-final to the eventual champion, which gave him a chance to win bronze medal via repechage. However, Khatri lost the bronze medal bout to Kazakhstan's Izmagambetov Gani. He next participated in the 2009 World Junior Wrestling Championship, where he lost in the second round to Germany's Johannes Kessel. Although Khatri won gold medal at the Shaheed Bhagat Singh International Wrestling Tournament in November 2009, his first major success at the senior level came one month later when he became the Commonwealth Champion after defeating Pakistan‚Äôs Mohammad Umar in the final. =2010: Podium finish at the Asiad= In September 2010, during the selection trails for the Commonwealth Games at the national camp, several athletes, including Khatri, tested positive for the methylhexaneamine, a drug which was banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in 2010 itself. That resulted in his removal from the Commonwealth Games squad. However, due to declassification of the methylhexaneamine as a banned drug in September of the same year, the provisionally banned athletes were allowed to compete in the future tournaments. Nevertheless, hearing for the proposed ban kept going as they tested positive for the aforementioned drug during the period when it was classified as a banned stimulant. After getting temporary reprieve, he participated in the 44th edition of All India Wrestling Championship, where he won the Hind Kesari title after defeating Delhi's Nardener. Khatri‚Äôs campaign at the 2010 Asian Games began on a poor note as he lost to Kazakhstan‚Äôs Taimuraz Tigiyev in his opening bout. However, the disqualification of Tigiyev in the quarter-final bout against the eventual gold medallist gave Khatri a chance of podium finish through repechage. In the first repechage bout, he defeated Syria‚Äôs Raja Al-Karrad and in the next bout, which would decide the bronze medal winner, he secured victory against Korea‚Äôs Kim Jae-gang. =2011: Second Commonwealth Championships title= Mausam began his 2011 season with the 34th National Games. Representing Haryana, he won gold medal in the 96 kg freestyle event after defeating Jharkhand's Narendra in the final. In the Asian Championships, after getting bye in the first round, he lost to the eventual finalist in the second round. And he lost the bronze medal repechage bout against Mongolia's Natsags√ºrengiin Zolboo. In the 2011 Commonwealth Wrestling Championships, which was held in Melbourne, Khatri was able to successfully defend his title after winning the final bout against his countryman Varun Kumar. Participating in his career's first senior level World Championships, Khatri registered victories against Leon Rattigan and Harutyun Yenokyan in the first two rounds. However, he lost to Slovakia's Jozef Jaloviar in the pre-quarter-final. =2012‚Äì15: Doping ban and comeback= In his first attempt to qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics, he participated in the Asian OG Qualifying Tournament in March 2012, where he lost to Dorjkhandyn Kh√ºderbulga in the quarter-final. In the next month, participating in the World OG Qualifying Tournament, he failed in his last bid for the Olympic qualification after losing in the pre-quarter-final. After an extended hearing for the anti-doping violation, which continued since September 2010, Khatri was banned for two years in November 2012. However, Khatri appealed against the decision. And, after the hearing, the appellate body of National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) reduced his ban duration by nine months citing \\"314 days of delay in the proceedings before the Disciplinary Panel not attributable to the athletes\\". Thus ending his ban in February 2014. After the end of the ban, Khatri made comeback at the international circuit by participating in the 2015 Asian Wrestling Championships, where he reached to the quarter-final before losing to Japan's Takeshi Yamaguchi by 6‚Äì10. In his next tournament ‚Äì Torneo Citta a Sassari ‚Äì he finished with gold medal after defeating Canada's in the final. He was part of the Indian team which finished fourth in the President Cup of Kazakhstan after losing to Kazakhstan in the bronze medal play off by 5‚Äì3. In that play off, he lost to Mamed ƒ∞bragimov by 6‚Äì7. In the 2015 World Wrestling Championships, he lost to Russia's Abdusalam Gadisov in the second round. His opponent's entry into the final gave him a chance to win bronze medal via repechage. However, he lost to Germany's Stefan Kehrer by 5‚Äì6 in the repechage bout, thereby ending his campaign. The inaugural edition of the Pro Wrestling League took place in December and the Team Punjab Royals successfully bid for Khatri. His team finished third in the league. At the 2015 Senior National Wrestling Championships, Khatri finished with a silver medal after losing to Satyawart Kadian in the final. =2016: Gold at the South Asian Games= Representing India at the 2016 South Asian Games, which were held at Guwahati, he won gold medal defeating Afghanistan's Rajab Naseri in the final. However, his stint at the Asian Championships proved to be short-lived as he lost to Japan's Koki Yamamoto by 6‚Äì10 in the qualification round, finishing ninth in the tournament. In March, Khatri participated in the inaugural edition of the Bharat Kesri Dangal, which offered the biggest ever cash award among all the domestic wrestling tournaments ‚Äì carrying a prize of for the winner. The tournament, which was held at Gurgaon's Tau Devi Lal Stadium, saw participation of the country's top heavyweight wrestlers. He won the title defeating en route one of the strong title contenders Satyawart Kadian in the semifinal. Vying to book an Olympic spot for India in the 97 kg category, he participated in the 2016 World Qualification Tournament. After securing victory against Nikolaos Papaoikonomou by 10‚Äì0 in the round of 16, he defeated Germany's Erik Thiele by 8‚Äì4 in the quarter-final. In the semifinal, he lost to Mongolia's Dorjkhandyn Kh√ºderbulga by 6‚Äì8. And thereby missed the qualification as reaching the final was its prerequisite.

He is noted for having played an important role in the diffusion of Western medicine into Iranian society. He is also noted as the only westerner to have met the B√°b. Biography =Education= William Cormick was born in Tabriz to the Irish physician John Cormick and a local Armenian woman. Having been sent to England at the age of ten in order to gain an education, he was subsequently enrolled into the medical faculty of the University College of London. He received his qualification as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons on 17July 1840. A year later he was admitted into membership of the Society of Apothecaries, as well as being awarded a doctors degree in medicine from St. Andrew's in London. =Career= From 1844 to 1855 Cormick worked as a physician in London and in Paris. He was summoned to Iran, by the then incumbent king Mohammad Shah Qajar, as the second physician to the British mission and to become the personal physician to the king. In 1846 he was appointed as the second physician to the family of Abbas Mirza. Later he became the personal physician to the crown prince and the future king Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, when the latter was given the governorship of Azerbaijan province, which he held for seven months. Upon the ascension of Naser al-din Shah Qajar to the throne in 1848, Cormick travelled with him to Tehran. However, on the decision of the prime minister, Amir Kabir, he was replaced by the French physician Ernest Cloquet. This was part of Iran's policy of avoiding becoming over-dependent on either Russia or Great Britain. Cormick returned to Tabriz, where he lived for the rest of his life, continuing to practice medicine and becoming rich. =The B√°b= During the trial of the B√°b in Tabriz in July 1848, William Cormick and two Iranian physicians were given the task of certifying whether the former could be classified as mentally incompetent. The governing authorities were reported to be \\"reluctant\\" to give the B√°b the death sentence. Cormick, at the request of the B√°b, visited him several times as part of the medical treatment for his having been bastinadoed following his trial. This made Cormick the only Westerner recorded as having personally met the B√°b. He presented an account of his meetings with the B√°b in a letter to an American missionary friend named J. H. Shedd.Cormick, William. Dr. Cormick's Accounts of his Personal Impressions of Mirza 'Ali Muhammad, The B√°b, in Materials for the Study of the Babi Religion, compiled and by E. G. Browne. =Awards= He was awarded the Order of the Lion and the Sun (2nd class). On 19October 1876 Cormick became a fellow of the British Royal College of Surgeons. =Personal life= Cormick was married to an Armenian woman named Tamar, who was the younger sister of the Armenian wife of Edward Burgess (a trader). Cormick died on 30December 1877, and was buried in Tabriz in the same cemetery as his father, brother and nine other Cormick family members. References Sources   Further reading * Flannery, Vincent.

During her time as a Senator she was crucial in extending women's rights. Using her experience as a lawyer, she drew up the Family Protection Act, which granted women family rights. A number of elements in the proposed Act were picked out and greatly exaggerated by critics. This led to the Act becoming subject to great public debate and discussion in the media. Some members of the country's clergy claimed that the Act was not compatible with Islam, espoused loose moral standards and even considered publicly denouncing Manouchehrian as a heretic. Fearing for her safety, Manouchehrian fled Tehran for some time. The Act was later repealed following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Manouchehrian later resigned her seat in the Senate following a dispute with the Prime Minister Jafar Sharif-Emami. After Sharif-Emami addressed her in a rude manner during a parliamentary debate, he visited her home and apologised privately.

Media =Television= Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner nationalized the broadcasting of football matches of the Argentine Football Association. Meant as a measure to damage the finances of the Clar√≠n group, which owned the licence up to that point for a pay-per-view service, it was announced as an attempt to guarantee free access to football broadcasting. The nationalized football broadcasting was named F√∫tbol para todos (English: Football for All). It was used afterwards to promote Kirchnerite propaganda. No private ads were used in the segment of television advertisement, which included only state announcements, and attacks to rival parties and the press, either inside state announcements or in 6, 7, 8 ads. 6, 7, 8 was aired immediately after the matches, but the television rating did not stick, and dropped from 15 points to 2. The lack of advertising from private enterprises caused a huge deficit in the program, forcing the state to invest 3.86 million dollars on a daily basis to keep it up.Lanata, p. 81-83 =Newspapers= =Internet= The Kirchner government hired people to write in blogs, social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, internet forums and other web pages of public access. Known as \\"Blogueros K\\" or \\"Cyber K\\", they were financed by the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers. Their interventions are usually disruptive, and focused on discrediting the opponents with insults and cyberbullying.Mendelevich, pp. 52-54 An investigation from the TV program Periodismo para todos revealed a network of social bot registered in Twitter, posting messages of advocacy of the Kirchners. According to the investigation, 400 users committed identity fraud, using profile photos of other users. All those accounts had similar URLs, similar contents, similar posts, and published posts in the same time of the day. This network of users produced nearly 6,000 messages by month and 200 by day. This number of messages helped to establish \\"trending topics\\", the most popular topics of the day in Twitter. Ministers Nilda Garr√© and Juan Manuel Abal Medina shared many messages of those fake accounts, to further increase their popularity. The program also interviewed some people whose photos were used for the Twitter accounts, and confirmed that those accounts did not belong to them.Carnota, pp. 183-185 An instruction manual, named \\"T√©cnicas de resistencia activa: Micromilitancia\\" () was leaked in 2016. It instructed people to disrupt Facebook pages and the forums of the most important Argentine newspapers, such as Clar√≠n, La Naci√≥n, La Voz, and Infobae. It encourages the use of loaded questions to reveal the points of view of other people, and to reply by posting articles with information that harms the credibility of the government of Mauricio Macri, even if completely unrelated to the main article. =Demonstrations= Since his time as governor of Santa Cruz, N√©stor Kirchner employed government- organized demonstrations. When the opposition made an important demonstration against the government, the government organized another one that supported them. This served to install a polarization, and justify the government from ignoring the requests of the first demonstration.Mendelevich, pp. 95-96 =Neologisms= Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner frequently uses words in both grammatical genders, instead of using the standard male form. A common case is to replace the word \\"todos\\" () with the phrase \\"todos y todas\\". This style grew beyond Kirchnerism and was adopted by people in other countries. When the only difference between the male and female form of a term is a character that may be \\"a\\" or \\"o\\", the @ may be used in written language. Those styles have been rejected by the Real Academia Espa√±ola. A group of intellectuals that supported the Kirchners' presidencies, Carta Abierta created the neologism \\"Destituyente\\" (which is not in the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy), a synonym of \\"Destituidor\\", during the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector. It is used to describe someone or something that may be promoting a soft coup. The word has been used frequently since then to describe the opposition or critics of the government.Mendelevich, pp. 117-118 =Cadenas= Cadena nacional offered by Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner after her victory in the 2011 Argentine general election. Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner made a frequent use of the Cadena nacional to broadcast messages. It is a system where the regular programming of all TV and radio networks is interrupted and replaced by a message delivered by the presidency. Although it was initially conceived as an emergency population warning, it was used to make political announcements and opening of buildings and organizations. Some cadenas even featured stand-up comedy and part of a Hip hop music concert.Carnota, p. 18 Many cadenas featured casual conversations of Cristina with alleged common workers and regular citizens. This intended to generate an image of a president close to the people. Later press investigations revealed that these people were low-rank government officials, and the format was eventually dropped.Lanata, p. 78 Fern√°ndez de Kirchner argued that the cadenas were legal, as she used them to announce government actions that the mainstream media may be concealing. The usage was denounced in the Federal Authority for Audiovisual Communication Services as an abuse of power. Director Mart√≠n Sabbatella ruled that the cadenas were legal, repeating the arguments advanced by Fern√°ndez de Kirchner.Carnota, p. 31 Themes The main overarching theme of the \\"Relato K\\" is a purported conflict between the people and the factions that oppose the general will. Under this interpretation, N√©stor and Cristina Kirchner are aligned with the people. The latter side is usually composed by the non-Kirchnerite media (mainly the Clar√≠n newspaper), the rural industries, the financial services, the vulture funds,Mendelevich, pp. 210-211 and the imperialism and local Argentines aligned with it. Specific people or organizations may be placed on either side according to the political needs of the time, and the pro-Kirchner network may shift the support or criticism accordingly. Kirchnerism polarizes all people and organizations under this scheme, and does not acknowledge neutral parties. As a result, those who do not agree with Kirchnerism find it hard to stay neutral, and usually become anti-Kirchnerite themselves. Most information, people and events that would contradict the main premises of the Relato K are simply ignored, instead of explained.Carnota, p. 17 =History of Argentina= Presidency of Fernando de la R√∫a Fernando de la R√∫a was elected president in 1999 in the Alliance ticket. He resigned during the December 2001 riots in Argentina, which brought the Convertibility plan to an end. Many former members of the De la R√∫a's government worked for Kirchner in later years, such as Chacho √Ålvarez, Nilda Garr√©, Juan Manuel Abal Medina, Diana Conti and D√©bora Giorgi. Still, Kirchnerism makes frequent harsh criticisms to the Alliance, in order to imply that only a Peronist may successfully rule in Argentina. None of those former members of the Alliance manifested any concern about those criticisms.Mendelevich, pp. 29-30 The Relato K does not have a coherent perspective of the Cacerolazos, a protest tactic employed against De la R√∫a. Initially, when the cacerolazos had so far only been used during the crisis, they were praised as a tool of direct democracy. Cristina Kirchner received her own cacerolazos years later, such as during the 8N protest and the 2008 conflict with the agricultural sector. The Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considered that those protests came from rich people who may be losing their former privileges, and thus should be ignored.Mendelevich, pp. 66-68 Kirchnerism employed cacerolazos as a protest tactic against Mauricio Macri, but those were renamed as \\"Ruidazos\\", to avoid the contradiction. =Presidency of Mauricio Macri= Mauricio Macri became president in 2015, and succeeded Cristina Kirchner in office. His presidency is compared with the 1955 Revoluci√≥n Libertadora military coup, which deposed Juan Per√≥n. Although many judicial cases against Kirchner gained renewed speed when she left office, none of the judges were appointed during the presidency of Macri. The Libertadora enforced the Peronist proscription with tortures and executions, absent in modern Argentina. The economic problems that were ignored by the Relato during the presidency of the Kirchners, such as the high inflation, unemployment, poverty and crime rates, are fully blamed on Macri, and treated as if they came into existence during his term in office. =Economy= The economy of Argentina during the Kirchner government saw an increased prosperity, which also took place in most of Latin America during the period. It was caused by the economic growth of China, which increased the international prices of primary goods. One of those goods is soybean. Still, the \\"Relato K\\" maintains that the economic prosperity is the result of a process of industrialisation. The period is named \\"D√©cada ganada\\" (), a term used as a dichotomy of the name \\"D√©cada perdida\\" () used to describe the 1980s economic crises in Latin America. Both terms are contested by historians, as the periods had both positive and negative aspects.Mendelevich, p. 105 The usual way to describe the period as the \\"D√©cada ganada\\" is to compare the economic figures with the 1998‚Äì2002 Argentine great depression, as in most cases the figures are better than those of the crisis. Other less favourable comparisons are ignored, such as the comparisons with neighbour countries during the same years, or with the economic history of Argentina on a larger scale (for example, with the pre-crisis figures of the 1990s). It also treats the period as an homogeneous one, and ignores the changes in the figures that took place within it.Mendelevich, p. 106 =The press= Clar√≠n miente\\" (), a common Kirchnerite slogan about the press Despite of the presence of a network of supportive media, Cristina Kirchner rarely makes reference to it, and when she talks about \\"the press\\" or \\"the media\\" in general, she makes reference to the press that is not part of such network. She claims that the media concealed the good news about her government and gave great significance to bad news, in order to decrease the morale of the people. As a result, she made an extensive use of the cadena nacional (initially conceived as an emergency population warning) to announce the news that she considered that did not had a significant news coverage. The union leader Hugo Moyano, who supported the Kirchners at that point, attended a Kirchnerite political rally with a banner that reads \\"Clar√≠n miente\\" (), in reference to the Clar√≠n newspaper. It was incorporated to the \\"Relato K\\" as a frequent slogan. It was not used for specific news published by Clar√≠n, but to make reference to the newspaper as a whole, in order to discredit it. Despite of the defamation campaign, Clar√≠n is still the highest sold Argentine newspaper.Mendelevich, pp. 85-86 =Democracy= As other contemporary left-wing populists in South America, the Kirchners make frequent praises to democracy in their speeches, in order to conceal their authoritarian policies. They work on the premise that the populist leader is the embodiment of the will of the people, and as such should be allowed to rule with unlimited power. Under this vision, any attempt to place limits, controls or oversight to their actions is described as an attack to democracy, or a veiled attempt to make a coup.Kaiser, pp. 54-55 The 2011 presidential elections, won by Cristina Kirchner by a 54%, was often cited as a source of legitimacy for any policy. However, the Relato K does not grant a similar recognition to other elected governors that oppose them, such as Mauricio Macri.Mendelevich, p. 83 =Corruption scandals= Many corruption scandals took place during the presidency of Cristina Kirchner, and other were revealed after it. The usual approach to those scandals was to completely ignore them, and make no mention about corruption whatsoever. This approach was abandoned after the decline of kirchnerite media, as independent reporters would usually ask them about the scandals. The answers are always generic, and never address any specific details of the scandals. One of those new approaches is to point to other scandals involving Mauricio Macri, and propose that the corruption scandals involving the Kirchners would not be an actual problem, because all Argentine politicians from all parties would be involved in similar practices. In this line, Ottavis proposed that the Kirchnerite officials are corrupt because they are human beings, subject to temptations. Another approach is to put the blame on the businesspeople that pay bribes, instead of those officials that receive them. This approach was used during the Skanska case, the Jos√© L√≥pez scandal and the Kirchner involvement in the Operation Car Wash. A third approach relies on anti- imperialism and proposes that the scandals would be defamation campaigns seeking to topple them. The impeachment of Dilma Rousseff is cited as well, proposing it to be a region-wide attack over the leaders of the Pink tide, despite the lack of evidence of it. A fourth approach proposed that Claudio Bonadio investigated and indicted Cristina Kirchner out of hatred, orders from Macri, or even both. This approach was slowly abandoned when several more judges and prosecutors continued with those investigations. =The people= The Kirchners make frequent appeals to emotion, claiming both that they love the people, and that the people love them. Rather than just their own supporters, the sentiment is attributed to the whole population of Argentina.Mendelevich, pp. 33-34 Kirchnerite interpretation Cristina Kirchner downplayed the impact of state propaganda, suggesting that private media may be more powerful than it. She based her reasoning in the amount of money involved in the media market, which is bigger than the state budget destined to promote propaganda. The philosopher Ricardo Forster considered that all political movements have a \\"relato\\", but pointed that there is a limit on the amount of manipulation of information that may be used by it in order to stay convincing. He also said that the people who criticize the \\"relato\\" may be motivated by resentment or elitism. Journalist Alejandro Horowicz considers that the \\"relato\\" is a tool used in the class struggle. Historian Norberto Galasso considers that journalism and foreign academia can not be trusted in their descriptions and reports about the Kirchners, as he considers that those have always been dominated by the ruling classes.Galasso, p. 366 Writer Pablo Alabarces considers that the state-owned media during the Kirchnerite regime reported reality and the private media reported complex lies and manipulations, but Mar√≠a Julia Oliv√°n from the program 6, 7, 8 rejected that interpretation.Alabarces & Oliv√°n, p. 18 References Bibliography    See also * Kirchnerism * Post-truth politics * Public image of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner Kirchnerite propaganda Cults of personality Presidency of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner ","title":"Relato K"},{"id":"51279479","text":"Chase Distillery, Ltd. is a British single-estate distillery based in Herefordshire, United Kingdom.

History Catherine Maria Thornber n√©e Rowland (c. 1813 ‚Äì 15 May 1894) was born in Rodd, Herefordshire.Janet Scarfe, 'Thornber, Ellen (1851‚Äì1947)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/thornber-ellen-9253/text15431, published first in hardcopy 1990, accessed online 10 August 2016. An assertion that Robert Thornber arrived in Australia before his family is contradicted by the shipping records. She and her husband Robert Thornber ( ‚Äì 28 December 1854), and their four children lived in Harpurhey, near Manchester, then emigrated to South Australia on the Superb, arriving in November 1840. They settled first at Port Adelaide, then Kensington, finally a house later known as \\"Peliatt Villa\\" in Mitcham. Also on the Superb were Mrs. Thornber's parents Jane (c. 1790‚Äì1867) and Charles Rowland (c. 1790‚Äì1881), and her sister Mary Ellen Rowland (c. 1824‚Äì1911). Charles lost a fortune in some speculations, but managed to stay in business, trading as Thornber and Rowland until at least 1876, perhaps with one of his sons-in-law. Robert Thornber, who was in business with his father-in-law, initially prospered, and in 1848 was able to donate an acre of land for St. Michael's Anglican Church, Mitcham, then suffered some severe financial setbacks, was declared insolvent and their home was put up for auction. He took a fatal dose of laudanum while suffering from delirium tremens. To make ends meet, Catherine started a school for girls in her home. \\"Mrs. Thornber's School\\", as it was popularly known, was successful and she was able to move to a larger house on on Gover Street, Unley Park.G. B. Payne History of Unley 1871‚Äì1971 Corporation of the City of Unley Sometime before 1879 the street name was changed to Thornber Street.Kyre College, founded in 1902 by David Henry Hollidge (1868-1963), and the nucleus of Scotch College, was located at 4 Thornber Street. Her two older daughters assisted in the operation of the school. The youngest, Ellen Thornber (1851‚Äì1947), trained as a teacher, and assisted in running the Grote Street teacher training college, then in 1880 was appointed assistant head of the Advanced School for Girls. She left in 1886 to become partner in her mother's school and helped prepare students for Adelaide University's matriculation exams. Students at the school were predominantly daughters of the clergy and professional men, attracted by its high standards in the teaching of science and languages, and by its liberal teaching methods, influenced by Fr√∂bel and Montessori. The school building was enlarged with the addition of an upper storey. Thornber died in 1894 and her eldest daughter, known as \\"Miss Catherine\\" and her two sisters ran the Unley Park School (as it had become known) at 37 Thornber Street until December 1906, when it was taken over by Caroline Jacob to become part of Tormore House School, and closed in 1911. Their home was at 39 Thornber Street. Family Catherine Maria Thornber, n√©e Rowland, (c. 1813 ‚Äì 15 May 1894) was married to Robert Thornber ( ‚Äì 28 December 1854). Their children included: *Charles Rowland Thornber (9 June 1834 ‚Äì 14 October 1920) married Elizabeth Ann ?? (c. 1841‚Äì1916) with the Moonta Mining Company. He was one of the first to be enrolled at St Peter's College and was involved with Alexander Tolmer's gold escorts. He was postmaster and librarian at Moonta for 43 years, died in Western Australia. *Edward Thornber ( ‚Äì 1 April 1905), also one of the first SPC students, worked as a commission agent, had a small farm of on Unley Road and made some excellent wine; moved to Broken Hill, where he died. *Catherine Maria Thornber (17 November 1837 ‚Äì 30 September 1924) ran the school after death of her mother. She was generally known as \\"Miss Thornber\\", and her mother, who had the same names, as \\"Mrs. Thornber\\". This article has a great deal of additional information.

It is located within the field of vision of the Kepler spacecraft, the satellite that NASA's Kepler Mission used to detect planets that may be transiting their stars. In 2012, a potential planetary companion in a very eccentric orbit was detected around this star, but its planetary nature was not confirmed until 12 June 2014, when it was named Kepler-419b. A second planet was announced orbiting further out from the star in the same paper, named Kepler-419c. Nomenclature and history Prior to Kepler observation, Kepler-419 had the 2MASS catalogue number 2MASS J19414029+5111051. In the Kepler Input Catalog it has the designation of KIC 12365184, and when it was found to have transiting planet candidates it was given the Kepler object of interest number of KOI-1474. The star's planets were discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits move in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. The name Kepler-419 derives directly from the fact that the star is the catalogued 419th star discovered by Kepler to have confirmed planets. The designation b and c, derive from the order of discovery. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star, and c to the furthest. In the case of Kepler-419, there were two planets detected, so the letters b and c are used. Stellar characteristics Kepler-419 is an F-type star that is approximately 139% the mass of and 175% the radius of the Sun. It has a surface temperature of 6430 K and is 2.8 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 14. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Planetary system Only the first planet is known transit the star; this means that the planet's orbit appear to cross in front of their star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Its inclination relative to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight it is, vary by less than one degree. This allows direct measurements of the planet's periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring the planet's transit of the star. The innermost planet orbits the star every 69 days at a distance nearly the same as the Mercury‚ÄìSun distance, which Kepler-419b orbits at 0.37 AU. It has a very eccentric orbit, and as such experiences large temperature swings as its eccentricity is 0.83. The eccentric orbit could not have been caused by the star itself, there must have been a more distant companion. In 2014 the discovery of a 7.3 planet orbiting at 1.68 AU was announced, through the transit-timing variations method. Kepler-419c is notable because it orbits within its star's habitable zone, and, even though it has a mass 7 times that of Jupiter, it is listed as a good candidate for potentially harboring a habitable exomoon.http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/hec_plots/hec_orbit/hec_orbit_Kepler-419_c.png Because of this, some astronomers have begun taking interest in Kepler-419c to search for these potentially habitable exomoons. As of , no exomoons have been detected in orbit around the planet.

Establishment A portion of the 2015 election ballot of Greenfield, Massachusetts lists the sole candidate running for the office of that town's Elector Under Will of Oliver Smith Oliver Smith was a wealthy miser resident in Hatfield, Massachusetts, who died on December 22, 1845. His will directed his estate be used for the good of the citizens of nine designated towns in Hampshire and Franklin counties, namely, Amherst, Deerfield, Easthampton, Greenfield, Hadley, Hatfield, Northampton, Whately, and Williamsburg, instead of being divided among his successors. The will of Oliver Smith was challenged by Smith's disinherited relatives. Rufus Choate, representing the relatives, argued that a witness to Smith's will, Theophilus Phelps, was insane and the will, therefore, invalid. According to twelve different friends, physicians, and family members who offered testimony, Phelps had believed, since a student at Amherst College in 1843, that he was being pursued by an invisible force intent on capturing and dissecting him. Phelps himself was called to the stand by Daniel Webster, acting on behalf of the will's executors. During his testimony, Phelps showed extreme composure and claimed that, while he had previously had health issues, he had not suffered any \\"headaches\\" or \\"fears\\" for the preceding two years, covering the time in 1844 when he attested the will. Surrebuttals were offered from others who had recently observed unusual behavior by Phelps; in one case it was claimed Phelps had been seen sitting motionless in a sleigh outdoors in the middle of winter for two hours. Nevertheless, Choate and the relatives ultimately lost their challenge to the will's validity. Office The will was put into effect in 1859. Since then and as per its instructions, residents of each of eight towns in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, separately choose electors who, in turn, select a board of trustees to administer the provisions of the will. The Electors Under Will of Oliver Smith are public officials elected to renewable terms of one or two years on the general election ballot. David Murphy, the Elector Under Will of Oliver Smith of Northampton, Massachusetts, is sworn into office in 2014 The Electors assemble annually in May and the citizens of any town whose Elector fails to attend this assembly for two successive years are disqualified from the benefits of the will. Should all towns be disqualified, the authority of the Electors is transferred to the General Court of Massachusetts and the will's benefits extended to all residents of Hampshire County. Vacancies among the board of trustees occurring between assemblies of the Electors are filled by appointment of a Hampshire County probate judge. A portion of the Smith estate was spent soon after the settlement of the probate questions to found Smith Vocational and Agricultural High School. The remainder of the estate is a perpetual endowment whose proceeds are annually disbursed to fund the Smith Charities: a series of scholarships for vocational training and nursing education, nominal dowries paid to newlywed brides, and payments made for every minor child of a widow from one of the eight Elector towns upon the death of her husband. Seat of the Electors The seat of the Electors Under Will of Oliver Smith is located at 51 Main Street in Northampton, Massachusetts, in a Victorian Renaissance structure designed by William Fenno Pratt and constructed by the Electors for their use in 1865. Amounts granted versus expenses The Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General, Non- Profits & Charities Division online Form 990 for 2018 shows that the Smith Charities granted $17,223, had revenue of $171,415, expenses of $123,564, and assets of $4,340,408 - figures similar to 2017.

Biography Isidore Legouix was the eldest son of the music publisher and bookseller Onesimus Legouix (1809‚Äì1867). His father's business, which had opened early in the reign of Louis-Philippe I, was located at 4, rue Chauveau-Lagarde, in the 8th arrondissement. In 1847, Isidore Legouix entered the Conservatoire de Paris where he studied harmony with Napol√©on Henri Reber and composition with Ambroise Thomas. He obtained a first prize in music theory in 1850, a first prize in harmony in 1855, and the following year a \\"2me accessit\\" in counterpoint and fugue. Competing for the Prix de Rome in 1860, he received an honorable mention for his cantata Le Czar Ivan IV to words by Theodore Anne. After graduating from the Conservatoire, Legouix worked in the family music shop and engaged in composition, particularly in incidental music. He composed several operettas, of which contemporary critics praised the talent and wit. But one could hardly win against the overwhelming competition of the works by Herv√©, Offenbach, Lecocq, Audran, Planquette and Varney, the masters of Parisian operetta. Despite his fifteen works in this genre, Isidore Legouix would never reach the same fame, even if some of his operettas encountered a some success. Legouix also composed some pieces for piano and songs. He wrote (in English) the op√©ra comique The Crimson Scarf (L'√âcharpe cramoisie), played in the 1870s in London. Legouix married in 1900 in Boulogne-sur-Seine with Aur√©lie Gregory. He died 1916 three weeks after his younger brother Gustave. His publishing catalogue was taken over by his younger son, Gustave Legouix (1844‚Äì1916), then by the latter's son, Robert Legouix. In 1960, the store, under the banner \\"Libraire Musicale R.

At that time Galveston was a major port of entry to the United States for European emigrants, and with the aid of a German-language textbook for scholars of Biblical Hebrew, she was able to puzzle out first the name of Galveston and later the names of other geographical locations from which telegrams were sent for newspaper publication, such as London, Saint Petersburg and Berlin.

For the first three months she had a young teacher whom she characterized as ‚Äúboth incredibly gifted and infinitely devoted to his cause.‚Äù The lessons were conducted by the direct method of ‚ÄúHebrew through Hebrew‚Äù, mainly through oral instruction and without a textbook. :‚ÄúFrom the first lesson, I left with a precise knowledge of only two Hebrew words, but of the truth of this knowledge I did not have the slightest doubt. I knew what it means when the teacher turns to his pupils and asks, ‚Äú◊ê◊™◊ù ◊û◊ë◊ô◊†◊ô◊ù‚Äù, Atem mevinim? (‚ÄòDo you understand?‚Äô). I had not seen the Hebrew letters yet, and only learned the sounds by ear. But this knowledge ‚Äî as well as what was added over time in these lessons ‚Äî was solid and thorough. It was systematic and correct knowledge that was impossible for me to lose.‚Äù Although that teacher was popular with his pupils, he aroused suspicion for going about in Moscow with a light summer coat and without galoshes. He had invited some of his students, who did not know enough Hebrew to be able to study on their own, to take Russian-language lessons in the Tanakh, or Jewish scriptures. The lessons, sporadic and conducted at the homes of various students, led to the group's being perceived as a new and possibly dangerous revolutionary group, and arrests and an inquiry followed. Lacking the required ‚Äú–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ –∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞‚Äù, pravo zhitel'stva (right of residence) in the capital, the teacher was regarded as living there illegally and was forced to leave Moscow, but Elisheva continued to learn Hebrew off and on during the next two years. On the death of her father in 1917, Elisheva returned to Ryazan, the city of her birth. With that year's fall of the Russian monarchy, she witnessed street demonstrations ‚Äúin celebration of freedom‚Äù, which had been forbidden under the former regime. In one of these demonstrations, she participated with a group of Jewish youths, marching in an orderly way under the new national flag singing Hatikvah, a modified version of which eventually became Israel‚Äôs national anthem. In Ryazan, with some sleuthing and the help of a local rabbi, she was led to a scholar in an attic room who used to tutor boys in reciting the Jewish prayer book, the Siddur. This teacher was very young but with a thick, curly black beard, who combined, she wrote, ‚Äúa taste for biblical grandeur with childlike na√Øvet√©.‚Äù After she demonstrated her ability to read the prayer book's morning blessing (Modah ani lefanecha... (‚ÄúI thank You...‚Äù), he consented to help her continue her Hebrew study. Unfortunately, she wrote, he tended to direct conversation towards social and political problems, and her language lessons with him did not long continue. She tried from time to time to study with Kantorovich's ‚Äú–¢–µ–æ—Ä–∏—è –∏–≤—Ä–∏—Ç–∞‚Äù, Teoriya ivrita, a book she disparaged as ‚Äúclearly outdated‚Äù with Russian explanations, translation exercises from Hebrew into Russian and back, and many ‚Äúcompletely meaningless‚Äù, context-free sentences like: ‚ÄúReuben lay on the bed with a bandage on his forehead.‚Äù Later she found another teacher, but, Elisheva writes, neither he nor she had suitable textbooks. Though that teacher had taught for many years, he had never taught the direct method, so they had to make use of Kantorovich's book. From 1918 to 1919 she studied with another Hebrew teacher, a graduate of Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium in Jaffa, a city that the British forces had just captured from the Ottoman Empire and which soon became part of the British Mandate for Palestine. The young man had come to Russia to visit relatives but had been drafted into the army. Wearing his regulation bulky grey uniform and so-called beetle-crusher boots, he met Elisheva in the street and the two were able to converse in Hebrew with the Sephardic pronunciation that Eliezer Ben Yehuda, the reviver of modern spoken Hebrew, was said to have preferred to the Ashkenazic one. ‚ÄúBefore then,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúit had not occurred to any of my teachers that it was possible to have a conversation in Hebrew.‚Äù Elisheva's first published poems in Russian, with the illustrations of Ben-Zion Zuckerman (1904‚Äì1992). Writing career Beginning in 1915, Elisheva's first translations from Yiddish into Russian were published in the Russian-language Jewish journal ‚Äú–ï–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–∞—è –ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å‚Äù Evreskaya Zhizn (‚ÄúJewish Life‚Äù).Jewish Women's Archive, \\"Elisheva Bichovsky biography.\\" Retrieved 7 August 2016. These are mainly short stories by Hersh Dovid Nomberg (1876‚Äì1927), poems by Shmuel-Yankev Imber (1889‚Äì1942?) and indirect translations, via Hayim Nahman Bialik's Yiddish version, of the Hebrew poems of the 12th-century Judah Halevi. Later she began to translate into Russian the works of contemporary Hebrew writers such as Gershon Shofman (1880‚Äì1972) and Yosef Haim Brenner (1881‚Äì1921). During her time in Ryazan between 1917 and 1919, as her Hebrew skills were deepening, she composed over 200 Russian poems, published by her fianc√© Simeon Bikhovski in two 1919 collections, ‚Äú–ú–∏–Ω—É—Ç—ã‚Äù Minuty (‚ÄúMinutes‚Äù) and ‚Äú–¢–∞–π–Ω—ã–µ –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏‚Äù Tainye Pesni (‚ÄúSecret songs‚Äù). Both were published under her pseudonym ‚ÄúE. Lisheva‚Äù and showed a strong attachment to and longing for Jewish culture. From 1920, when she married Bikhovski, she published her first poems in Hebrew and definitively adopted the name Elisheva instead of her original Russian given name Elizaveta. Apparently influenced by both her original Hebrew teacher and by her husband, she now adopted Hebrew as her sole working language and ceased writing in Russian; Simeon himself adopted the Hebrew form of his name as Shimon. They married in a civil registry office because their difference of religions prohibited a religious wedding. Elisheva's poetry also appeared in the almanac Ha-Tkufa (‚ÄúEpoch‚Äù, Warsaw, 1921), the magazine Ha-Toren (‚ÄúThe Mast‚Äù, New York, 1922), Hapoel Hatzair (‚ÄúThe Young Worker‚Äù, Tel Aviv, 1923) and \\"Ha-Olam\\" ( \\"The World\\", London, 1925). In 1925 the Bikhovskis moved to Palestine, with their young daughter Miriam (b. 1924), settling near the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium in Jaffa. There she published two poetry collections, Kos ktana (‚ÄúSmall Bowl,‚Äù Tel Aviv, 1926) and Haruzim (‚ÄúRhymes,‚Äù Tel Aviv, 1928),Society for Research on Jewish Communities, Elisheva, –≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –ï–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–∞—è –≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è, Vol. 10, pp. 586‚Äì588. Retrieved 8 August 2016. and her employment of Sephardic pronunciation in her poetry became the accepted norm. As one of Palestine's first Hebrew poets, Elisheva helped give form to the literary life of the emerging country, explaining: ‚ÄúI can point to but one goal in my work ‚Äî to aid as much as possible in the development of Hebrew poetry in the Hebrew language that we speak among ourselves every day with the Sephardic pronunciation. Therefore I have refrained from all experimentation and pursuit of new forms or innovations in my poetry, because first and foremost I want to see Hebrew poetry that is vital, natural and inextricably linked with our language and our lives.‚Äù The Jewish public were quite moved by Elisheva's having left her people and language behind to join the Jewish newcomers in their emergent homeland in Palestine. The literary community initially greeted her with enthusiasm, arranging readings of her works, which were widely published, even to the point that her popularity aroused resentment of some young poets (the Ketuvim ‚ÄúWritings‚Äù group, headed by Avraham Shlonsky, 1900‚Äì1973) and made her a target in their struggle against the older poets (the Moznayim ‚ÄúScales‚Äù group, led by Hayyim Nahman Bialik, of which Elisheva herself was a member). This period lasted only seven years (1925‚Äì1932), during which Elisheva produced the bulk of her Hebrew poetry, prose, essays and literary criticism, with works published in the Hebrew press in Palestine (Moznayim, Do‚Äôar ha-Yom) and abroad (Ha-Tkufa, Ha- Toren and Ha-Olam), or in books published by her husband's publishing house, Tomer. Elisheva: Kovez Ma‚Äôamarim odot ha-Meshoreret Elisheva (‚ÄúElisheva: Collected articles about the poet Elisheva‚Äù appeared in several editions in Tel Aviv and Warsaw, beginning in 1927, and Meshorer ve-Adam (‚ÄúPoet and man‚Äù), an essay on the poetry of Alexander Blok, appeared in 1929). Kos Ketanah was the first book of poems by a woman poet, and Simta‚Äôot the first novel by a woman, to be published in Palestine. Some of her small and melodious poems have been set to music, translations of individual Hebrew poems into Yiddish, Russian, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish and Welsh have been published by various periodicals, and new translations into Russian were included in a collection entitled –Ø —Å–µ–±—è –¥–æ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞ (‚ÄúI told myself before the end,‚Äù Biblioteka Alia, 1981, 1990.) Elisheva's grave at Kvutzat Kinneret cemetery. In later years Despite her writing career and his publishing business, the couple often found themselves in dire financial straits, and Elisheva was several times forced to leave her husband and daughter behind for literary tours of Jewish communities in Europe where she did poetry readings and told stories to large audiences at specially arranged events; during the school vacation in summer, her husband and daughter would accompany her. In the summer of 1932, in the midst of such a tour in Chi»ôinƒÉu ‚Äî then in Romania and now in Moldova ‚Äî her husband, Shimon, suddenly died. Elisheva returned to Tel Aviv, sorrowing at her husband's death, and her attempts at earning a livelihood (among other things, as a librarian at Tel Aviv's Sha‚Äôar Zion public library) were unsuccessful. Although she had earned a living from her literary tours of Europe, she and her daughter now fell into absolute poverty. She moved into a rundown shack on the edge of Tel Aviv, where she was saved from starvation when the poet Hayim Nahman Bialik secured for her a modest stipend of $15 monthly from the non-profit Israel Matz Foundation, a New York nonprofit organization established to aid indigent Hebrew writers. Bitter and hurt over no longer being in literary favour among the Jews of her adopted Palestinian homeland, she cut herself off from society and ceased publishing new work. She did some translations, which she considered insignificant, but was forced to make ends meet by working as a laundress. Her daughter Miriam Littel served in the British Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) in Egypt during World War I and in 1946 married a British soldier, with whom she had three daughters, and in 1949 Elisheva had planned to visit them in England. Because she was not feeling well, however, some friends from the Davar HaPoelet women's magazine paid for her to have a visit to the hot springs in Tiberias, where she died of cancer on March 27, 1949. Despite the deep affection Elisheva maintained for Jewish culture and its involvement in the eventual establishment of the state of Israel, she had never converted to Judaism ‚Äî a fact that she never hid; she always remained an Orthodox Christian ‚Äî so difficulties arose as to the place of burial. Only upon the intervention of the chairman of the Hebrew Writers Association in Israel was it agreed that she could be buried in the cemetery of Kvutzat Kinneret, near the grave of the poet Rachel Bluwstein. Literary critique of Elisheva According to Yaffah Berlovitz, Elisheva represented the early 20th- century schools of Futurist and Acmeist poetry, which supplanted the Russian Symbolist movement of the late 19th century. :‚ÄúThe Acmeist school advocates short lyrical poems phrased simply, clearly and melodically, reminiscent of a painting with rapid brush strokes and a fragile, aesthetic line. ‚ÄòMy poetry is brief, a cloud in the sky,‚Äô in Elisheva‚Äôs words; nonetheless, she also incorporates anti-Acmeist elements, for example, a longing for the mysterious and dreamlike, or a reference to Symbolist expressions. These elements are the consequence of a conflicted, questioning worldview at the centre of which lies a profound sense of alienation (‚ÄòI had no mother; I will have no son‚Äô), while at the same time there is a relentless longing for an unidentified metaphysical entity (‚Äòa God without name‚Äô) that can promise her vitality and happiness as a human being and an artist. This melancholic spiritual confession, which does not commit itself to any specific religion, also frames her poetic space as an endless pilgrimage of wandering and despair ‚Äî a journey embarked on with the clear knowledge that no utopian ‚Äòland of Avalon‚Äô awaits her at its end (‚ÄòAll my soul yearns/for the land of false hopes‚Äô). :‚ÄúThis sense of a conflicted state of existence ‚Äî between a reality of abandonment and exile on the one hand, and the pursuit of a promised land on the other, between the ‚Äògrey day‚Äô of the secular and the ‚Äòenchanted night‚Äô of the sacred ‚Äî draws Elisheva closer to the Jewish people. She identifies her fate with theirs: ‚ÄòOnly on the setting sun will my eyes gaze/Only on the Eastern Star ‚Äî your heart‚Äôs lament/Who will say to us all that there is no Homeland?‚Äô (‚ÄúGalut,‚Äù Toren 57). Thus it is not surprising that she connected with Zionist Jewish circles in particular, nor that she chose to immigrate to Palestine, which for her represented the source of creativity and inspiration: ‚ÄòWhen it seems to me at times that the wellspring of my poetry has run dry, I am struck by the feeling: There, in the land of beauty, the Divine Presence will shine on me once more.‚Äô :‚ÄúThe poetic oeuvre of Elisheva can be divided geographically into Russian and Palestinian chapters; not so her prose, which deals solely with the reality of the early decades of the twentieth century in Russia. Her transition to prose was inspired by the poet Alexander Blok, whom she regarded as her greatest teacher (‚ÄòMore than ‚Äòsimply‚Äô a poet, he is the essence of our life‚Äô). In her essay Meshorer ve-Adam, she examines his writing, stressing his uniqueness, which stems from a dynamic of expansiveness that constantly leads him to a different poetic experience (thematic, genre- related or formative) and, at the very least, avoids creative stagnation. Elisheva adopted this challenging principle, expanding her horizons from the lyric poem to the short story, and from the lyrical short story to the realistic novel. :‚ÄúEach of her six short stories revolves around a woman who speaks of herself in the third person, against the backdrop of her own life story and environment. Although the setting differs from story to story, all of the protagonists seem drawn from the same ‚Äòconfessional I‚Äô that is so dominant in Elisheva‚Äôs poems as well. It is the portrait of a woman unable to communicate with those around her; amid the conflict between herself and her surroundings, she constructs ‚Äî in a manner unique to her ‚Äî her own inner spiritual dream-world, which she inhabits with intensity ‚Äî as in Yamim Arukim (‚ÄúLong days‚Äù) and Ha-Emet (‚ÄúThe truth‚Äù). This imaginary spiritual world also reinforces the Jewish-Christian conflict, which is expressed primarily within the framework of male-female relationships (Jewish woman/Christian man ‚Äî Malkat ha-Ivrim (‚ÄúQueen of the Hebrews‚Äù); Christian woman/Jewish man ‚Äî Nerot Shabbat (‚ÄúSabbath candles‚Äù), which refers to Elisheva herself: ‚ÄòBecause I have two souls ‚Äî one Russian and one Hebrew.‚Äô :‚ÄúThis conflict is further developed in her novel Simta‚Äôot, which deals with Moscow of the early 1920s, during the brief period when Lenin was in power and attempted to restore the collapsing Soviet economy. Elisheva offers us a glimpse into Moscow‚Äôs bohemian scene at this historical juncture, with its m√©lange of men and women, Christians and Jews, engaged in the various arts; through them, she examines the cultural- political upheaval of post-revolution Russia, combining feminist tendencies on the one hand with Zionist leanings on the other. There is no question that through this novel Elisheva contributed thematic constructs previously unknown to Hebrew literature in both Palestine and the Diaspora: a depiction of the ‚Äúnew woman‚Äù of the post-World War I era; the self-portrait of woman-as- creator; and the dialogue between Christians and Jews, as seen from a non- Jewish perspective. :‚ÄúElisheva was received with ambivalence by the Jewish public in the Diaspora and in Palestine. On the one hand, Jews were flattered by her decision to work in Hebrew (‚Äòthe language of the heart and of twilight,‚Äô as she put it); not without reason was she referred to as ‚ÄòRuth from the banks of the Volga‚Äô (in an allusion to the biblical Ruth the Moabite). On the other hand, there were critics who attacked the quality of her writing and the level of her Hebrew, arguing that her work was highly overrated. Not so today. A fresh reading of her work, especially from a feminist perspective, reveals a creative diversity that enriched modern Hebrew poetry and prose with a feminine voice all its own ‚Äî a voice that offered not only content and range but an inner rhythm with its own unique meter and cadence. At a time when the majority of poets based themselves on the Ashkenazic pronunciation of the Diaspora, she was one of the first to accentuate her verse according to the Sephardic stress on the final syllable (which eventually became the dominant form in Palestine and, later, in Israel).‚Äù Books published in Hebrew * 1926: Kos Ketanah (‚ÄúA little cup‚Äù), poetry * 1926: Im Or Boker Be-Kol Rinah (‚ÄúWith morning light and a joyful song‚Äù), poetry * 1928: Haruzim (‚ÄúRhymes‚Äù), poetry * 1928: Sipurim (‚ÄúStories‚Äù), short stories * 1929: Simta‚Äôot (‚ÄúAlleys‚Äù), novel * 1929: Mikreh Tafel (‚ÄúA minor incident‚Äù), story * 1946: Shirim, (‚ÄúPoems‚Äù) * 1970: Yalkut shirim (‚ÄúCollected poems‚Äù)Institute for the Translation of Hebrew Literature, Bnei Brak, Israel, 21 Aug. 2002 (Archived).

The Customs House and the Hoppo's Headquarters at GuangzhouInitially, the Hoppo was always a Manchu and a bondservant of the imperial family, appointed personally by the emperor, not a scholar-official chosen through the exams, but after the mid-18th century this expectation was relaxed. Since he depended on the good will of emperor and the Imperial Household Department, the Hoppo could be trusted to send revenues directly to the court rather than through the normal bureaucratic channels. In the mid-18th century the Qianlong emperor approved the Canton system, which restricted the burgeoning overseas trade with Europeans to Canton and granted a monopoly on that trade to Chinese merchants, who formed the Thirteen Hongs. European governments likewise granted monopolies to their trading companies, such as the British East India Company. Regulating the lucrative trade between the monopolies on either side gave the Hoppo great leeway in setting and collecting tariffs and fees, which were substantial, and the additional surcharges, bribes, and customary fees enabled him to send even more substantial sums to Beijing. As the opium traffic grew in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Hoppo was caught between conflicting demands. On the one hand, the British Parliament ended the East India Company's monopoly in 1834 and traders now demanded free trade and low, fixed tariffs; on the other hand, the Manchu court expected the Hoppo to control the foreign traders, stop Chinese smuggling, eliminate the opium trade, but continue to supply substantial revenue. Foreign objections to monopoly and his irregular impositions were among the causes of the Opium War (1839-1842). The Treaty of Nanking (1842) ended the Canton System but the office of Hoppo was not abolished until 1904 as part of the reforms at the end of the dynasty. The word \\"Hoppo\\" is Chinese Pidgin English. Some have speculated that it derived from Hu Bu '(Board of Revenue). But the Hoppo had no connection to the Board, leaving the origin of the word uncertain.  The early history and functions of the office, 1685‚Äì1759  The position of Administrator of the Canton Customs (Hoppo) was established in 1685, when the Manchus had largely conquered the south. In the early years of the dynasty they feared that rebels and remnants of the Ming dynasty would attack from the sea, but now it felt safe to end restrictions on sea trade and allow ports along the southern coast to re-open. There were Hoppos at other ports, including Macao and Fujian. Initially, the emperor appointed Manchu bond- servants to the office, who would be dependent on the imperial clan and could be trusted to serve their interests. The opportunity to gather revenue was not limited to the regular tax quota set in the official regulations, a figure determined by the number of foreign ships that came to Canton, but included the unofficial quota and further extractions, each of which was roughly equal to the regular quota. The regular quota was sent to the provincial treasury, but the extra tax quota and exactions were sent directly to the Imperial Household Department, which was controlled by the imperial clan. Hoppos met resistance from all sides. On the Chinese side were powerful merchants, the Thirteen Hongs, who, in many cases, had been in the import and export business for generations and could outlast any individual Hoppo, who depended on them for cash and local knowledge; on the European side, the British East India Company (E.I.C.), the Dutch East India Company (V.O.C.), and the Swedish East India Company, who had government covenents that guaranteed them monopolies, wanted the Hoppo to set low, predictable, and quickly settled charges. The emperor divided coastal trade coast into three types: internal trade, including trade with other ports up and down the coast; trade with Southeast Asia; and trade with European powers. In order to keep the office from accumulating too much power, the emperor allowed the Hoppo to touch only the European trade, although this type of trade turned out to be the most lucrative and, in the mid-18th century, fastest growing. The Viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi, who had power over two provinces, might remain in office for a decade and was Han Chinese, tried to undermine the Hoppo's power and collect the lucrative fees for themselves. The place of the Hoppo in the bureaucratic structure changed several times in a series of attempts to strike a balance between the Hoppo and the governor. At a certain point, one official served as both Viceroy and Hoppo; then there were two Hoppos; then the office virtually disappeared and the duties were carried out by provincial officials; and finally, in the 1750s, the Viceroy was appointed as Hoppo even though there was a Hoppo in office. In 1761, the court once again made the Hoppo an independent post, though with less power, and no longer was it only for ethnic Manchus.  Under the Canton System, 1759‚Äì1842  The Hoppo became central to China's trade relations with Europe after 1756, when the Canton system limited European trade to Canton and granted a monopoly in doing business with foreigners to a restricted group of Chinese merchants, who were organized into \\"Hongs,\\" or \\"trading houses.\\" Controlling relations between these two monopolies made the Hoppo's position lucrative but not comfortable. He had to pay off influential officials in order to be considered for appointment, pay them again once he was in office, and pay them once more at the end of his term if he expected to move on to another attractive position. He had only three years in office to recoup the money he had spent to gain it. The Hoppo sent an estimated million or so taels a year to Beijing, but his personal income might be ten or more times as much, perhaps 11 million taels. Moreover, 18th century Canton trade revenues increased by as much as 300 per cent, most of it in the 1790s. The Hoppo Returning By Boat from an Official Call on the East India CompanyThe power and responsibility for all aspects of foreign trade were in the hands of the Hoppo. His officers met each ship as it arrived at Whampoa Roads, the landing spot down-river from Canton, where each ship was required to engage a \\"Chinese linguist,\\" that is, a representative of the Hoppo, as go-between and interpreter. The Hoppo's officers measured the length and width of the ship to determine its cargo capacity, negotiated the payments the ship would pay based on that capacity, and set a time for the ship's officers to meet with the Hoppo, often in his ceremonial hall. In the early years, the Hoppo would personally lead as many as forty or fifty junks and sampans to conduct the measuring ceremony, which was accompanied by fireworks, band music, and, until they were judged too dangerous in the 1780s, cannon salutes. In those years, the Hoppo bestowed impressive gifts on the newly arrived ships, such as two live bulls, but by the early nineteenth century these gifts had become an empty formality. Partly because of the Hoppo's \\"cumshaw\\", that is, the informal payments he solicited, the costs of entering and leaving Canton were probably the highest in the world. One foreign trader's 1753 Hoppo Book listed the tariffs and informal payments collected at Canton, including five kinds of taxes: * Import Duty: payable by a fixed tariff. * Export Duty: payable even if the goods are being re-exported to another Chinese port, at a fixed tariff charge, plus a six percent duty * Extra charges on goods imported or exported: Examples include a duty sent to Beijing; charges for weighers, linguists, and such. These amounted to nearly half the tariff duty. * The Measurage. * The Present: Directly to the Hoppo. Like the emperor he represented, the Hoppo was responsible for the moral and social lives of the people in his jurisdiction. The Hoppo looked after the Canton merchants and foreign traders in matters both small and great: When the daily provisions supplied to the Thirteen Factories were faulty, the foreign merchants complained to the Hoppo; when the constant sound of wood-chopping annoyed a trader, he complained to the Hoppo; in 1832, when a British trader became incensed at what he felt was bad treatment, he set the Hoppo's residence on fire. On the other hand, when the emperor, viceroy, or governor wished to control or chastise the European traders, they gave this burden to the Hoppo, who told the Hong merchants to instruct their foreign partners to \\"repress their pride and profligacy.\\" In 1759, for instance, the English interpreter James Flint defied Chinese law and custom and went to Tianjin, where he sent a memorial directly to the emperor reporting corruption and malfeasance at Canton; the Hoppo was held responsible for Flint's transgessions, and was immediately dismissed. More important, in the face of the crisis caused by steeply increasing sales of opium and outflow of silver, the Hoppo was expected to bring the foreign merchants to heel, maintain revenue flows to his superiors, and rein in opium smuggling. The opium trade and transformed relations Since the Hoppo was the only Chinese official to have direct contact with the foreign traders, they held him responsible. Respect for him cooled even further with the growth of the opium trade in the early 19th century and turned completely sour after 1834, when England declared free trade and ended the monopoly of the E.I.C. and demanded that China open its markets. The Hoppo's response was mixed and uncertain. He tolerated smuggling around Canton because he feared that a crackdown would simply force operations elsewhere, disrupt the lucrative trade in tea and cotton, and interfere with the flow of payments to Beijing. Collusion between the Hoppo's men and the smugglers became so well-established and mutually profitable that opium could be shipped directly to Canton rather than being sold offshore clandestinely or warehoused down-river at Whampoa. The Hoppo had little reason to rock the boat or look beyond his three-year term. Besides, when they sold opium directly to Chinese distributors, foreign traders no longer relied on the Hoppo to make arrangements or need him to pay off the governor and other officials, since the Chinese distributors now do these tasks for themselves. The Hoppo was now caught in a dilemma. The court counted on him to send customary revenues but required him to suppress opium; the foreign merchants increasingly blamed him for the barriers that kept them from what they thought of as the vast China market and they demanded low and fixed tariffs rather than the duties set ship-by-ship. This mixture of toleration and collusion came to an end in 1839 when Viceroy Lin Zexu arrived with a strong new imperial mandate to wipe out the opium trade. During the confrontations and battles of the First Opium War, the Hoppo had no power over the foreign traders or leverage over the Chinese ones. After the British decisively defeated the Chinese, they imposed treaties that ended the Canton System by publishing fixed tariffs and opening trade at four more treaty ports, but the office of Hoppo continued. The late 19th century By the end of the century, Chinese maritime customs officials had lost much of their importance to the Imperial Maritime Customs Service. The position of Canton superintendent, still referred to colloquially as \\"Hoppo\\", was abolished in 1904 as part of the late Qing reforms. Sir Robert Hart, Inspector General of the Customs Service, wrote to a friend, \\"Did you see that the old post of Hoppo at Canton has been abolished? This is a good step and will make financial reform possible at Canton\\". Changing views Western historians initially echoed the views of British traders and diplomats who saw the Hoppo as obstructing China's entrance into the era of free trade and global interchange. Hosea Ballou Morse, the early chronicler of China's foreign relations, acidly remarked that the Hoppo's office was established \\"in order to milk the trade of the wealthiest trading mart in the empire, and the incumbent of the post luxuriated in the abundant supply of the richest milk during the whole time that Canton enjoyed its statutory and actual monopoly of foreign trade\\". Morse wrote that \\"a share in his gains passed directly to the inmates of the Imperial palace, from the highest down the scale to concubines and eunuchs\\". Morse saw the office as an obstacle to progress: \\"the office of the Hoppo and a fixed tariff did not harmonize, for the proper performance of the duties of a Hoppo depended on the magnitude of the margin between the revenue collection as officially reported and the sums actually taken from the traders.\\" Austin Coates wrote of the \\"caprice, the greed and the injustice of the Hoppo and his mandarins\\" Other late twentieth century historians were less sympathetic with foreign demands and explanations. Cheong Weng Eang, for instance, publishing in 1997, explained the Hoppo's apparent inefficiency and evasion of responsibility as the bureaucracy's way of reconciling diverse interests. Origin of the word The word \\"hoppo\\" is Chinese Pidgin English, and some have speculated that it derived from \\"Hubu \\" (Board of Revenue). But the historian Jacques Downs says that origin of the word is unknown, as the Hoppo had no connection to the Board, and sent revenues to the Imperial Household, two units whose interests were antagonistic. Henry Yule and A. C. Burnell in their Hobson-Jobson Glossary of Anglo-Chinese Words note that the term \\"is said to be a corruption of Hoo poo [Hubu]\\" and that Samuel Wells Williams gives a \\"different account\\", but that \\"neither gives much satisfaction.\\" , p. 426.

The office monitors earthquakes and conducts seismological research. Specifically, it provides earthquake surveillance and hazard reports to governmental agencies. It consists of various divisions: * Earthquake Monitoring & Services * Earthquake Hazard & Risk Assessments * Geophysical Observation Systems The Seismology Division and Earthquake Risk Evaluation Centre of the India Meteorological Department merged with NCS in August 2014 to more effectively monitor and research seismological activity. The Centre's objective is to improve understanding of earthquake processes and their effects through seismological research and monitoring. In July 2017, NCS released a mobile app, \\"IndiaQuake\\", that disseminates realtime earthquake information.  Earthquake monitoring in India  Earthquakes in Indian subcontinent occur due to the north-eastward movement of the Indian Plate and its interaction with the neighboring Eurasian Plate in the north. Most of earthquakes occur in the plate boundary regions; however, a few damaging earthquakes have occurred in the plate interior regions as well. A few damaging earthquakes in the plate-boundary regions include the following: 1897 Shillong plateau, 1905 Kangra, 1934 Nepal-Bihar, 1950 Chayu-Upper Assam, 2004 Sumatra-Andaman, 2005 Kashmir and 2015 Gorkha earthquakes. In the plate interior regions, damaging earthquakes occurred in 1993 at Killari, Maharashtra, in 1997 at Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, and in 2001 in Kachchh, Gujarat. Earthquake monitoring in India started as early as 1898, with the establishment of an earthquake observatory at Alipore, Kolkata (Calcutta). This followed the great Shillong Plateau earthquake in 1897. After independence, the number of observatories increased to 15, and after the worldwide seismograph station network in 1964, the number increased to 45. After the 1993 Killari earthquake, the arrival of digital instrumentation allowed NCS to develop observatories across India. There are currently 84 such observatories. Dense networks of observatories are present in the N.E. India and Delhi region because this area has been given special priority. A dedicated Real Time Seismic Monitoring Network provides continuous data to the Tsunami Warning Centre at NCS. All observatories are equipped with a SAT communication facility for the transfer of data in realtime to the Operational Centre. Continuous seismic data of seismological observatories at Mimic, Port Blair and Shilling are shared globally. With the current network, earthquakes of a magnitude of 3.5 can be located within five to ten minutes with reliable accuracy. The information on earthquake guidelines are disseminated to all concerned state and central government departments through a short message service (SMS), fax, or e-mail. IndiaQuake is an application developed to provide this information to citizens in real time.  Seismic Microzonation  A priority of NCS is to provide seismic microzonation of major urban areas in India lying in seismic hazard zones. This exercise has been initiated for 30 cities in India, including Delhi.  Seismological Research  NCS is actively involved in seismological research related to estimating shallow and deep crustal structures in various tectonic domains of the India land mass. This research provides insight into earthquake occurrence processes in the Himalayas, the Burma plate, and the Sumatra trench, as well as crustal deformation measurements in the plate-boundary and plate-interior regions.  IndiaQuake  IndiaQuake is a mobile app that provides realtime information about the parameters of earthquakes occurring in India. These parameters include location, time, and magnitude.

Plot  Izu and Ogasawara (labeled) archipelagos in Japan Mikura Amelia runs an air delivery service with her grandfather in Izu ≈åshima, Japan. After finding out that he has died, she discovers his journals about \\"Electric Island\\" left for her and a package for her to deliver there. The entries are written into the future and provide Mikura with instructions on how to locate the island, which doesn't have a fixed location. After three days, she manages to find the island using wave radar, but upon going in for a landing, falling debris from a burning building causes her to crash. Mikura is rescued, but the island is gone. Mikura resolves to find Electric Island again, neglecting her sleep and deliveries to the point of losing electricity in her house. Based on the journals, she learns that the island moves around cyclically over a period of approximately three years. She also receives the notes of Ryugo, her former teacher and a geophysicist who worked with her grandfather to study the island. She believes that Ryugo, who was lost at sea in a typhoon six years ago, and her grandfather both attempted to reach Electric Island. As the day of the cycle approaches again, Mikura finds out that her cell phone from the crash was found by a dolphin, who is being tracked by a researcher. Determining that the island must have brought it back, she uses the tracking data to locate the island and prepares to set out for it.  Release  The manga was first published as part of Kodansha's manga anthology ' on July 13, 2010. It continued sporadic serialization in Kodansha's manga magazine Afternoon in 2012.

In December 2015, Dark Horse Comics announced that it had licensed the manga in North America, publishing the first volume on July 26, 2016. The manga has also been published in Taiwan by Tong Li Publishing.  Themes  The protagonist of the manga flies a Fairey Swordfish According to Anime News Network's Rebecca Silverman, the protagonist Mikura Amelia's cat named Endeavour is likely a reference to James Cook's ship HMS Endeavour and her family name \\"Amelia\\" a reference to Amelia Earhart. Silverman also suggests parallels between Electric Island and Shangri-La, as well as influences of Gulliver's Travels and Treasure Island on the manga. Joe McCulloch of The Comics Journal found the combination of Mikura's \\"devastated mental state\\" and her scant attire to give the manga a voyeuristic aspect. He also detected undertones in the attitude and content of the manga, but called it a more sophisticated application than usual.  Reception  Zainab Akhtar of The Guardian listed the manga as one of the \\"comics and graphic novels to look forward to in 2016\\". At Comic-con International 2016's \\"Best and Worst Manga\\" panel, the manga was part of the list of \\"Best New Manga for Grown-ups\\". It was nominated for the 2017 Eisner Award in the \\"Best U.S. Edition of International Material‚ÄîAsia\\" category. Silverman commended the detailed art and the believability of Mikura's island, noting that her light attire comes off as being for comfort rather than fanservice. Silverman concludes that the first volume is \\"the kind of book you can get lost in\\". Kate O'Neil of The Fandom Post noted Tsuruta's use of his intricate hand-drawn art to tell the story, describing the manga as \\"filled with whimsy and obsessive detail.\\" However, Silverman was disappointed in the cliffhanger ending, saying: \\"perhaps it lingers a bit too long on setting the mood because it feels like the story is just beginning as this volume ends.\\" Shea Hennum of The A.V. Club complimented the manga's art, calling it a \\"beautifully drawn and precisely detailed rendering of life on the Izu and Ogasawara islands\\". However, Hennum found the story to be \\"quotidian and mundane [...] devoid of sexuality or even romance\\". She concludes that the juxtaposition of this innocence with Tsuruta's fanservice leads to a mismatch in tone, resulting in a bemusing experience. McCulloch compared Tsuruta's art to Hiroaki Samura's‚Äîwhose Blade of the Immortal is also serialized in the same magazine‚Äîcalling it \\"lithe and painterly\\", where it could also possibly be appreciated for distinguishing itself from the art of manga.

History The municipality was proclaimed on 25 June 1874, following a petition from local residents that February, although there been had earlier opposition to incorporation. It consisted of five members at its creation, with two seats from each of a North Ward and South Ward and a separate position for the mayor. The first town hall had originally been the Wallaroo Institute, but had subsequently been taken over by the council for use as a town hall. This became too small for community purposes, and a new town hall was built in 1902 at a cost of ¬£3,050. The building was completely destroyed by fire on 26 December 1917, involving substantial loss of municipal records. It was immediately rebuilt, with the new hall reopening in February 1919. Prior to the collapse of the Wallaroo and Kadina Mining Company in 1923, the Wallaroo council bought power from the company rather than producing it themselves, leaving them temporarily stranded when the company went into liquidation that year. In 1936, the municipality covered an area of approximately two and three quarter square miles, and had a population of 4,000. It was responsible for 29 miles of streets and roads and 800 acres of parklands, and had undergone an active tree planting program.

Early life Aguad Jorge was born in a Havana suburb. As a young man, he met and befriended Joaquin Monserrat, an actor who later moved to Puerto Rico and became famous there as children's character \\"Pacheco\\". Aguad Jorge himself became involved in acting during his youth in Havana, performing at several theatrical plays there. Life in Puerto Rico In 1961, Aguad Jorge moved from Cuba to Puerto Rico, where he reunited with old times friend Monserrat. He was introduced to Luis Vigoreaux, sr. and to Tomas Muniz, jr.. This in turn led him to get a role in the 1965 Puerto Rican television show La Criada Malcriada, starring Velda Gonzalez Jacobo Morales, Emma Rosa Vicenti and Aguad Jorge himself. The show was a major hit and Aguad Jorge became a celebrity across his new country. This show was immensely popular among Puerto Ricans (even influencing a local tomato sauce brand to rename itself as \\"Criada\\" sauce) and, in 1968, Puerto Rican marketing firm \\"Badillo-Compton\\" came with the idea for Holsum Bread to hire Aguad Jorge as national brand spokesperson in Puerto Rico. His friend and fellow Puerto Rico celebrity \\"Pacheco\\" himself introduced Aguad Jorge to his new job at Holsum. Aguad Jorge enjoyed his new job so much that he actually not only performed as the brand's spokesperson, but worked himself at Holsum's plant daily for the next 23 years until he retired in 1991. He also had Holsum make a custom sized truck that he drove himself to personal public appearances. Aguad Jorge continued participating on Puerto Rican television until his later years, on a show named \\"Contra el Reloj\\", alongside Monserrat, on Canal 4 in Puerto Rico. In this show, he shared activities with Jeanie Carrion, sister of the later to become famous show host and businessman, Puerto Rican Josue Carrion. Death Luis Aguad Jorge died on November 6, 2007, at a retirement home in San Juan, Nuestra Senora de la Providencia, where he had been living since 2005. His funeral was attended by, among others, Puerto Rican businessman, actor, show host and politician Roberto Vigoreaux-son of Luis Vigoreaux, sr.-and Holsum Puerto Rico president Ramon Calderon. As his body was driven from the funeral home to Porta Coeli cemetery in Bayamon, Holsum company trucks lined up at Las Americas Expressway, all with dark linens on, in honor of Aguad Jorge.

Taralga Wind Farm was CBD Energy/Santander's first and only wind farm. It is a 106.8 megawatt wind farm with 51 turbines. The energy produced by the wind farm can power around 45,000 average Australian households per year, saving over 258,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year.http://www.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au/media/40762/cefc_factsheet_taralgawind_lr.pdf Location The Taralga Wind Farm is near Taralga. Timeline On 20 February 2012, approval was granted by the New South Wales Government for work to commence on the Taralga Wind Farm, after the approval of the Stage 1 CEMP. The project consists of 51 wind turbines generating 106.8 Megawatts of electricity on ridges to the east of Taralga. Electricity generated by the project will be fed into the national power grid through a 37.5 km transmission line to Marulan Substation. The project created up to 200 local jobs during the construction phase. Approval of the wind farm followed an unsuccessful challenge by the Taralga Landscape Guardians in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales to block the project on the grounds of aesthetic and environmental impacts including noise emissions and blighting of the landscape. Chief Justice Brian Preston ruled in favour of approving the wind farm as the long term benefit of reduced greenhouse gas emissions was in the greater public interest. On June 2015, the wind farm was fully commissioned and commenced commercial operations. The layout of the wind farm can be seen through this link. On March 2015, the Chinese state-owned utility State Power Investment Corp agreed to purchase the Wind Farm for a reported A$300 million, which includes the A$200 million debt facility from the CBD Energy (now BlueNRGY) and Banco Santander subsidiary Capital Riesgo joint venture.http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/china-state-firm-buys-taralga-wind- farm-as-banco-santander-exits-72059 The project is currently operated under an O&M; contract with Vestas Australia, and has Wind Prospect CWP as asset Managers.http://cwprenewables.com.au/asset-management/ Funding To help fund the construction of the wind farm, CBD Energy/Santander signed a A$200 million project finance debt facility agreement with ANZ, CEFC, and EKF.http://www.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au/media/40762/cefc_factsheet_taralgawind_lr.pdf The project had off-take backing from EnergyAustralia The total project cost was A$280 million.

The company was based in San Francisco and employed 90 people as of August 2016. The company focused on retrofitting semi trucks with radars, cameras and laser sensors to make them capable of driving themselves. In August 2016, Otto was acquired by Uber. Lior Ron, the co-founder of the company, had stated that Otto would have self-driving fleets of trucks on the road by early 2017, which, before the company ceased, never materialized. In summer 2018, Uber shuttered the Otto project to focus on self-driving cars. History Otto was established in January 2016, and was currently one of a new generation of automobile firms venturing into making self-driving vehicles. The company was founded by Anthony Levandowski, who worked on the Google self-driving car project, and Lior Ron, who was a product lead on the Google Maps team. Claire Delaunay, who led the software development and Don Burnette, from Google‚Äôs self-driving car team were also co-founders. The team in August 2016 comprised 90 employees, with engineers from Google, Apple Inc., Tesla, Logitech, Stanford University and elsewhere. The firm‚Äôs base was a garage in the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco. Uber self-driving Volvo XC90 parked outside the Otto headquarters. In August 2016, Otto was acquired by Uber at an estimated valuation of $680 million. Otto was to stay independent from Uber, according to Lior Ron. Anthony Levandowski would continue heading up Otto, as well as being in charge of Uber's self-driving division. =Achievements= In October 2016 an Otto truck achieved the longest continuous journey by a driverless and autonomous semi-truck. It was a 132-mile route from Colorado Springs to Fort Collins in Colorado, USA. The truck traveled autonomously without a lead vehicle, teleoperation, or any other human intervention. Technology autonomous Volvo VNL tractor units equipped with various sensors. Otto did not build its own trucks. Instead, the company made hardware kits which could be installed on trucks at service centers or factories. The goal of the company over the first few years was stated to be for the technology to be used by truck drivers during long-haul drives to allow them to rest during the journey. This in turn would reduce the number of hours it took for drivers to complete a journey by potentially being able to drive continuously, and overcome the 11-hour legal restriction on manual driving. As of August 2016, Otto had converted five Volvo 780 semis with self-driving technology and was testing them on interstate highways. They use similar technology to those developed by Google and Nissan, equipping the trucks with radar, cameras, and lidar. The automated technology makes driving more efficient, and would allow a truck driver to sleep while the truck is driving itself. Levandowski has stated: \\"Our goal is to make trucks drive as humanly as possible, but with the reliability of machines.\\" Safety According to John Markoff of The New York Times, Otto made the conscious decision to automate trucks rather than passenger vehicles because, ‚ÄúNationally, trucks drive 5.6 percent of all vehicle miles and are responsible for 9.5 percent of highway fatalities.‚Äù The need to make truck driving safer is one of the aims of the firm. Ron has been quoted as saying: \\"We want to get the technology to the point where it's safe to let the driver rest and sleep in his cabin and we can drive for him, exit to exit.\\" Eventually the trucks will be able to drive autonomously on the 220,000 miles of highways in the US, though in some states such as California there may be regulatory obstacles. The firm intends to collect safety data to demonstrate the benefits of the automated technology. In an interview with Emily Chang of Bloomberg West, David Kirkpatrick, the CEO of Techonomy Media, stated that the public is far more likely to embrace trucks with automated driving than passenger vehicles due to the wide perception that trucks are driven dangerously by truckers.  Lawsuits  In February 2017, Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging that Anthony Levandowski \\"downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo‚Äôs highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation\\" before resigning to found Otto. In March 2017, United States District Judge William Haskell Alsup, referred the case to federal prosecutors after Levandowski exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination. In May 2017, Judge Alsup ordered Levandowski to refrain from working on Otto's Lidar and required Uber to disclose its discussions on the technology. Clearpath Robotics filed a complaint in the Northern District of California on August 24, 2016 against Ottomotto LLC with respect to its OTTO brand. The action was dismissed with prejudice on February 1, 2017. Clearpath Robotics continues to operate the OTTO brand. In response, Clearpath issued a statement about the confusion.https://www.ottomotors.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/otto- motors-releases-statement-on-waymo-v-ottomotto-lawsuit In May 2017, Uber officially retired the Otto brand as a result of the lawsuit with Clearpath Robotics Inc.https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2017/05/25/otto-changes- name-uber-trademark-infringe See also *Starsky RoboticsBloomberg on Starsky RoboticssFortune on Starsky RoboticsStarsky Robotics website: about References External links *Official site Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Defunct companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Unmanned ground vehicles Vehicle safety technologies Advanced driver assistance systems Uber acquisitions 2016 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Otto (company)"},{"id":"51280401","title":"Ooh I Do"},{"id":"51280404","text":"Seoknam Station is a subway station on Line 2 of the Incheon Subway.

The Kedmi Commission also known as The Cohen-Kedmi Commission was set up in 1995 during the Israel prime minister Yitzhak Rabin to investigate the missing of hundreds of Jewish infants, most of those belonging to Jews from Yemen who has migrated to the newly created State of Israel between 1948 and 1954 through the Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen). History The first reported incident of missing children was publicly reported in 1950, when the Association of Yemenis in Israel demanded the police to investigate the disappearance of hundreds of Yemeni children who were considered dead, but the burial place was not known and death certificates were not issued. The first official investigation The Minkovski-Bahlul Commission was set up in 1967, the commission's findings revealed that it had reviewed 342 cases and according to the Commission, 316 missing children died, 2 were adopted, and the fate of the rest were never known or mentioned in the records. The Yemeni community was dissatisfied with the commissions findings, thus resulted in ordering a second commission in 1988 the Shalgi Commission. The Commission reviewed 301 cases and concluded that most of them had died during and after birth, and could not establish a conclusion of 65 cases. The Kedmi Commission; was commissioned during the Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, in the year 1995 (after the unsuccessful conclusion of the Minkovski-Bahlul Commission and the Shalgi Commission) the commission's finding were publicly released in November 2001. Initially the commission was headed by retired Judge Yehuda Cohen as well as two other members retired Judge Dalia Kobel and Major General David Maimon. During March 1999 Yehuda Cohen the head of the commission was legitimately replaced by Supreme Court Judge Yaacov Kedmi, giving it the name the Cohen- Kedmi commission or simply The Kedmi Commission. The commission concluded in its report that most of the children had died of illnesses, while some of those were adopted, the commission also rejected the state sponsored or institutional conspiracy in disappearing of children. A research scholar Shoshana Madmoni-Gerber‚Äî( author of \\"Israeli Media and the Framing of Internal Conflict: the Yemenite Babies Affair, 2009) had concluded in her book with hundreds of testimonies that the disappearance of babies was a state sponsored conspiracy. In June 2016, Benjamin Netanyahu the Prime Minister of Israel had appointed Tzachi Hanegbi-(in charge of National Security and Foreign Affairs) to reopen the files to discover the truth. According to Washington Post in July 2016, Hanegbi updated media that after looking at material from government inquiries into the matter, he is now sure that hundreds of Yemeni children were taken away from their parents, although he could not say why or where they went.

In the novel, Jack Ryan Jr. must stop a German private contractor from unleashing false flag attacks to profit from the war on terror. Duty and Honor is Blackwood‚Äôs last contribution to the Jack Ryan Jr. series, which is part of the overall Tom Clancy universe. It debuted at number four on the New York Times bestseller list. Plot summary Jack Ryan Jr. is on a forced leave from The Campus after disobeying orders in his last mission (depicted in Commander in Chief). One night outside a market in Alexandria, Virginia, he survives a mugging attack by fighting back; the wounded mugger later stumbles into an eight-wheeler truck, killing him. Ryan investigates the circumstances behind the incident using clues left behind by his attacker, and is later convinced that he is being targeted for assassination when he finds out that another man similar to his description was killed a week ago. Over the course of his investigation, Ryan meets Effrem Likkel, a Belgian freelance journalist who is following up on a lead about seemingly missing French soldier Ren√© Allemand. Allemand, son of a former Marshal of France, had disappeared from his post in Ivory Coast. Likkel, however, finds out that he was kidnapped and thinks that he was brainwashed afterwards. Moreover, he reveals that Allemand and Jack‚Äôs would-be assassin, now known as Eric Schrader, had met in secret a week before the Lyon terrorist attacks, and further deduces that Allemand was duped by Schrader to carry out the attacks. Ryan and Likkel later team up to aid each other in their own investigations. The two travel to Munich, Germany and find out that Schrader is an employee of J√ºrgen Rostock, head of private military contractor Rostock Security Group. They find themselves attacked by Rostock‚Äôs men at every turn, but Ryan and Likkel manage to thwart them. They later venture to Zurich, Switzerland, originally to surveil Rostock‚Äôs lawyer Alexander Bossard, but instead find Allemand there. They conclude that Allemand was indeed brainwashed into working for Rostock by kidnapping him and faking his death. The now-erratic Allemand, suffering from the effects of Rostock‚Äôs brainwashing, was on the run from Rostock when he finds out that Schrader was involved in the Lyon attacks. Ryan later informs Allemand‚Äôs father about his son. Hugo Allemand reveals that Rostock became deeply Islamophobic after the death of his wife at the hands of a suicide bomber in Kabul, Afghanistan in 2005, when he was a government official. He later retired from public service and formed RSG, with a mission to eliminate terrorists by ‚Äúany means necessary‚Äù and outside the scope of government oversight. He had pitched his idea to the elder Allemand, who declined. Ryan, Likkel, and Allemand later go to Namibia to follow Gerhard Klugmann, Rostock‚Äôs main hacker. Ryan finds out that Rostock wanted Ryan killed because his audit for Dovestar Industrial Machinery, one of RSG‚Äôs shell companies, triggered an investigation from German financial regulatory authority BaFin; his scheduled testimony in the German court would expose Dovestar‚Äôs true purpose. Moreover, he and Likkel find out that RSG has been engaging in direct action sabotage on behalf of economic corporations in order to gain favor for funding its operations. Later, when Allemand is informed by Ryan about their investigation and Rostock's involvement, he storms out of the country and back to Zurich, intent on torturing Bossard for information about his plight. Ryan chases the French mercenary to Switzerland, and coaxes him back to reality. They leave Bossard and his wife at their home and return to Namibia, where they find out that Likkel was abducted. The two eventually save Likkel, who tells them that RSG are planning to sabotage the flow control system at Okavango Dam. Even though they capture Klugmann and kill some of the RSG mercenaries there, they fail to stop the computer virus planted by Klugmann from obstructing the dam, which claims the lives of 322 Namibian residents living nearby. Nevertheless, with Allemand rescued, Rostock was later convicted for his crimes and his company was dissolved. Invigorated by his experience handling Likkel and Allemand, Ryan contacts his boss Gerry Hendley about returning to The Campus.

At some point, the magazine changed its name to Mihir O Sudhakar. The magazine printed polemics on religious issues against another Khristiya Bandhab (Friends of Christians), a magazine published by Christian missionaries. = Ideological stance = According to Nurul Kabir, its objectives were defending Islam from orientalist's criticisms and the vilification of the Muslims by the local communalist Hindu intellectuals, enlightening the Bengali Muslims with Islamic principles and prevent conversions to Christianity. When Mir Mosharraf Hossain supported the ban on cow-slaughtering, the Sudhakar endorsed Tangail's Maulvi Naimuddin protest of the ban. Regular contributors included Munshi Mohammad Meherullah and Sheikh Abdur Rahim. Closure Sudhakar continued being published up to 1910. Legacy Nurul Kabir writes of The Sudhakar's influence on the development of the identity of Bengali Muslims: > \\"(The Sudhakar) infused a sense of confidence in the Muslim society of > Bengal about the inherent strength of Islam, enlightening the Bengali > Muslims about the great contributions that Islam has made in the development > of human civilisation and inspiring them to create their own literature in > their own mother tongue - Bangla.

Currently, he is Vice-Chancellor of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University and formerly of Nalanda Open University. Previously he was the Head of the Department of Zoology at Patna University, and is a pioneer researcher and wildlife conservationist, famous for his efforts for the conservation of Gangetic Dolphins, he is popularly known as the \\"Dolphin Man of India\\" . His scientific research and relentless conservation campaign for the last 4 decades have been crucial to the efforts of saving the Ganga River dolphin from extinction. In response to the awareness of the urgency of protecting the Ganga River dolphin raised by Sinha, the Government of India designated this Dolphin as the National Aquatic Animal of India in 2009. Early life Prof. Sinha was born in Keotar village in the Jehanabad district of Bihar on 1 July 1954. After his primary education in Keotar and Higher Secondary School at Makhdumpur, he joined Patna University in 1970 to study Biology. After graduating in Zoology, he joined Patna University as Lecturer in Zoology where he researched various ecological aspects of the River Ganga with special emphasis on the Gangetic dolphin and other biota of the river. A member of the IUCN Species Survival Commission and the National Ganga River Basin Authority, his contributions are reported in the establishment of the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, Bhagalpur and he is a recipient of the Order of the Golden Ark of the Netherlands. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2016, for his contributions to environmental conservation. Work R K Sinha conducted surveys of the entire length of the Ganges and most of its tributaries in India and Nepal to assess the distribution, population status, ecological requirements, and threats to the dolphin. The animal was facing extinction due to indiscriminate poaching and habitat degradation and loss in many areas. Sinha organized education and awareness programs among the local fishermen as well as secondary and college students. The national and international print and electronic media widely promoted his research and conservation efforts, attracting the attention of both national and international policy makers, executives, and scientific communities. He was designated as the \\"Dolphin Man of India\\" by S.Z. Qasim, Member of the Planning Commission, in the International Seminar on River Dolphins in Delhi in 1992. Sinha was invited to membership of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland in 1994; was elected Fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1996, and elected Chairman of the Asian River Dolphin Committee in 1997 under the aegis of the IUCN. Sinha has published over 100 research papers in peer-reviewed journals, four books, and over 40 technical and research reports primarily on the Ganges dolphin, river biodiversity, and Ganges pollution. In 2001, he accomplished the first ever rescue and translocation of a stranded pregnant dolphin. This Gangetic dolphin, which Dr. Sinha is trying to conserve, is one of the only three obligate fresh water dolphins in the world, one of the most endangered mammals on earth; an endemic species of the Indian subcontinent; a natural aquatic heritage of India and an indicator species of the health of the Ganga system. The Gangetic dolphins have long been poached for the extraction of their body oil as a fish attractant for use in oil fishery. Sinha discovered an alternative made from fish scraps. By effectively communicating and popularizing this alternative among Indian fishermen, dolphin poaching has been significantly reduced. This discovery was published in the internationally reputed journal Biological Conservation (London). Sinha developed the Conservation Action Plan for the Gangetic Dolphin in 2010 which was enthusiastically accepted by the Government of India. Sinha is also known for his contribution to two famous documentaries Alert on the Ganges (26 minutes, French) and Mr. Dolphin Sinha: Think Globally and Act Locally (52 minutes, English) both produced by Mr. Christian Gallissian in 2007. Sri Jairam Ramesh, Union Minister of Environment and Forests, highlighted Sinha's work in the Rajya Sabha on 8 March 2011 stating, \\"..one of the leading authorities on dolphin is a Professor. His name is R.K. Sinha, popularly called 'Dolphin Sinha.' With the help of people like him, we are trying to bring back the Gangetic dolphin which is a unique heritage resource for India.\\" Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission of India attended dolphin watches in Patna in 2011 and 2012. His enthusiasm for Sinha's conservation efforts led him to establish the National Dolphin Research Center in Patna, now in progress.

He became a noted preacher and popular confessor while being hailed as a second Vincent Ferrer and in the beginning was subjected to violent dislike and ridicule from fellow Dominicans before he was allowed to enter the order. His beatification received ratification from Pope Pius VII on 20 September 1818 after the pontiff confirmed the late priest's local cultus - or popular and enduring devotion. Life Francisco Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez de Posadas was born in the Kingdom of Spain on 25 November 1644 as the son of poor parents - who were war refugees - who belonged to an ancient noble household who had since declined in its status. He received his baptism in late 1644 not long after his birth. Posadas - while still a mere infant - was found on one occasion to have the name of the Madonna imprinted over his heart and it became the first word that he ever uttered. He recited rosaries on a frequent basis and his mother saw her son's great attraction to the faith in him and desired that her son enter the Order of Preachers. The death of his father came as a blow to the Posadas household and her mother later remarried to a man that held disdain for Posadas and treated him with crudeness. His stepfather insisted that the child stop his studies and be put to learn a useful trade as an apprentice. He did so out of obedience but never abandoned what he believed to be his true calling - he managed to obtain leave from his master and continued with his studies. Before she remarried his mother tried several different jobs and soon settled on selling eggs and vegetables at a street stand. Posadas's mother also encouraged her son to go to the Dominican- run church of Saint Paul where he would attend Mass from the age of six each morning. He commenced his novitiate in 1663 in the Dominican convent of Scala Coeli but was treated with harshness and contempt which he endured with remarkable patience; his novitiate ended in 1664. The Dominicans at first did not want him in the order because he was the poor son of a street peddler and even when the Scala Coeli fathers offered to take him and train him in Latin the vindictive dislike on the part of the prior almost prevented this from happening. His detractors within the order soon realized his holiness and patience and - in a unanimous decision - decided to admit him into the priesthood. The now-ordained Posadas sought to imitate Vincent Ferrer whom he chose as his special patron. He loved to administer to the ill and the imprisoned and refused all positions of leadership in the order - which he dreaded - while also turning down two bishoprics that were offered to him at different points. He was also said to have levitated on some occasions. The priest also published several works which included a biographical account of the life and works of Dominic of Osme. Posadas prepared in the confessional on 20 September 1713 when he died. His remains are housed in the Dominican church of Saint Paul. Beatification The ratification of his local 'cultus' - or a popular devotion - allowed for Pope Pius VII to issue a decree that confirmed the late priest's beatification on 20 September 1818.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"It's becoming a common occurrence for me to grow increasingly worried about the direction of an episode of Grimm up through the middle, only to have the back half wind together the various positive threads into something coherent. 'The Waking Dead' isn't much of a complete episode, and the pace doesn't set out to provide the same kind of payoffs as a typical case-of-the-week plot, but there's a simple reason for that: It's the first half of a two-part finale. The dramatic cliffhanger may be lacking intensity, instead inspiring a few questions, but it's a testament to the progress the show has made that even when the structure doesn't quite fit together or build properly, there are enough positive character moments to keep it from completely devolving. This is all setup for next week's finale, slowly building through longer scenes instead of cutting quickly and putting clues together at a healthy clip.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"'The Walking Dead' was a difficult episode to judge. It's unfortunate NBC couldn't work out the scheduling to air this and next Tuesday's installment back to back since so much of hinges on what's coming next. Nevertheless, this was a step up from last week's underwhelming episode.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"Although the scene where Rosalee, Bud, and Monroe woge in front of Juliette was very strong and nicely balanced the comedy with the genre elements (Bud was especially great), that really should have happened earlier in the show.\\" References External links  Grimm (season 2) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"The Waking Dead"},{"id":"51280867","text":"Sardar Singh UDAIPUR (29 August 1798 ‚Äì 14 July 1842) was the Maharana of Mewar Kingdom (r. 1838‚Äì1842).

The earliest known religious building on the site was in 1020 with a reference to a small rectangular chapel; however, a building probably existed in the 8th century. The current building, probably started in the 13th century was completed in its current format by 1466. The Town Church is considered the main island church so serves both the States of Deliberation and the Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey as well as the parishioners of Saint Peter Port. The current rector is the Reverend Matthew Barrett. History A church referred to as \\"Sancti Petri du Portu Mari\\" in 1048, may be a reference to the chapel on the site first recorded in 1020, was given to the Benedictine Abbey of Marmoutier by the Duke of Normandy. The Island was divided up into parishes in the 11th century and the Town Church became the parish church for Saint Peter Port. There is a granite carving of a spaniel's head ‚Äì probably a mason's mark, and of the same design as one at the Vale Church. In 1135 the church was described as standing next to a mill which was in the churchyard. By 1250 the current church building had replaced the earlier chapel, it had two transepts that were used as chapels. The earliest record of a rector of the parish is Pierre Le Valleys in 1282. The Town Church had the roof destroyed in 1305 and the rebuilt church was consecrated on 1 August 1312 at which time two chapels were in use dedicated to St. Julien and St. Jacques. The Bishop of Coutances, Robert de Harcourt, officiated, guests included the Abbot of Mont St Michel and the governors of Caen, Cherbourg and Southampton. Between 1466 and 1473 the church, including the spire, and the stair turret was completed in the main format that we see today. The break from the Catholic faith by Henry VIII of England resulted in the control of the church moving from the Diocese of Coutances to Winchester, this was followed by a return to Catholicism with Mary I of England in 1553 and the occurrence of a notorious event, the Guernsey Martyrs where the three women were tried by the Ecclesiastical Court in the Town Church in 1556. Elizabeth I of England became the Protestant Queen in 1558. The change to Presbyterian rule in 1563 saw changes to the practices in church as well as the removal of frescos and ornamentation. There were also 100 people on the Island during this period who were burned at the stake, hanged, branded or flogged after being accused of witchcraft. Noisy behaviour inside or outside the church was punished with a spell in the stocks set up in Town Church Square. The church has been Anglican since 1662 when the book of Common Prayer was translated into French on the orders of King Charles II of England for use in the Channel Islands. Services over the centuries were originally conducted in Latin, then French, then a mixture of French and English and only in the last century, mainly in English. It is now a tradition to hold worship services in the Town Church at Easter and Christmas in both Latvian and English. Building St Peter Port Church Stained-glass window in the church Located at the end of a valley on the seafront, on the original southern edge of the town, the building was close to, or on top of earlier Roman buildings that would have used the spring in Fountain Street. The church, which had been damaged by fire started by invaders, had to be rebuilt in the early 14th century. Around 1420 the present chancel and tower crossing with chapels and aisles to the north and south were completed. The South Transept was begun around 1450 and completed in 1466, having been built around the churchyard, the only space available. Additional works were completed by 1473, with the porch added around 1500. The nave, tower and chancel are out of alignment, possible due to the cramped site on which the church is built. A stone, one of ‚Äò‚ÄôLes Barrieres de la Ville‚Äô‚Äô were erected in 1700 against the church cemetery to the east of the church, to mark the boundary of the town which extended north. The quay to the east was built in the 18th century, necessitating the demolition of some old houses and opening up the view of the church from the sea. An organ by Holdrich was installed in 1811. A major renovation in 1822-6 saw the opening up of previously blocked windows and the Lady Chapel with the removal of the upper floor Ecclesiastical Court room, the relocation of the organ and the installation of a suspended plaster and lath ceiling. The rectory, located in what is now Market Street, was sold and demolished. There were medieval houses and a mill close to the west of the church that were demolished between 1830 and 1870 to extend the market, create a square and let Fountain Street reach the quay. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert landing from the Royal Yacht on the quay in front of the church in August 1846. In 1882 further renovation works were undertaken providing the current pews, Caen stone pulpit and Italian marble font as well as moving the organ to its present location. The roof was renovated and restored in 2006-7 with the electrics and a new sound system being installed in 2009. An entry in the Guinness World Records records the building as being the closest church to a pub in Great Britain, the distance being just 18 inches. =Tower and bells = The tower was completed around 1466 with the octagonal tower, topped with a ball and weathercock, dating from 1721. The hexagonal staircase turret has the oldest door in the Channel Islands inside it. 1736 saw a new set of 8 recast bells installed in the recently completed steeple. The clock bell, fastened in an external belfry dates from 1736. In 1782 a mechanical clock was installed with its four faces on the tower. Eight new bells were cast in Villedieu-les-Po√™les, France, in 1913 and mounted on the existing 1736 oak frames. Unfortunately, the French bell foundry did not appreciate the hanging requirements for English change- ringing and the bells proved so difficult to ring that they fell into disuse. In 1994, the bells were re-cast and re-hung by Taylor‚Äôs of Loughborough. The new ring of 8 bells was dated 1995 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Guernsey from German occupation, hence the name The Liberation Bells. They are the heaviest ring of bells in the Channel Islands, the tenor being 21- 1 ‚Äì 12 cwt. =Damage= The church has received damage from wars over the years. In 1294 and again in 1305 attacks by French forces badly damaged the church. The English Civil War saw the church in the firing line in 1643 between the Royalist held Castle Cornet and the Parliamentarian held town. Cannon balls fired from the castle caused some damage to the church. The Second World War saw the town bombed, first by German bombers in June 1940 and later by Allied bombers which caused damage to the glass in the town, in particular 8 Hawker Typhoon aircraft flown by No. 263 Squadron RAF attack on German submarine U-275, in the harbour on 14 June 1944 shattered most of stained glass windows in the church.  Military connections  The church was the Island garrison church, for both militia and British garrison regiments for many centuries. It was used to store the artillery for the town militia from 1768, and also for the town fire engine until both were evicted in 1822. The regimental colours of the Town Regiment of the Royal Guernsey Militia are hung in the Church, the militia was formed in 1337 and disbanded over 600 years later, in 1946. The colours of the Royal Guernsey Light Infantry which was formed to serve during the first world war, displaying their battle honours, are also hung in the church. The island has a strong connection with the sea and there are a number of memorials to naval officers, such as Admiral de Sausmarez. A plaque to Major General Sir Isaac Brock, \\"The Hero of Upper Canada\\", is fitted to the outside of the church. During the 1940‚Äì1945 occupation, German soldiers attended services, the German Commandant agreeing that \\"assemblies in churches for the purpose of Divine Worship are permitted. Prayers for the Royal Family and the British Empire may be said\\". Commemoration services are regularly held at the Church, especially on 9 May, Guernsey‚Äôs liberation day and on the Sunday closest to 11 November. Births, marriages and deaths The church records were held within the church until 1799 and show baptisms from 1563; marriages from 1565 and burials from 1566. There was almost no space for burials near the church, the Cimiti√®re des Soeurs, or Sisters' Cemetery was located on rising ground to the south of the Church, a Cimeti√®re des Fr√®res or Brothers' Cemetery being located north of town and burials in the church vaults causing unpleasant odors within the church. It was necessary to recycle graves regularly. In 1780 a Cimiti√®re des √âtrangers, or Strangers' Cemetery, was created, near Elizabeth College. This was superseded in 1830 by the Candie Cemetery, although paupers of the Parish continued to be buried at the Strangers Cemetery until 1880. Annual events The church hosts a number of charity and music events throughout the year, including youth music, organ and choral recitals. The annual church-to-church competition, where competitors have to touch each Guernsey parish church in a 19.4 mile race is a special Guernsey event attracting world class competitors starts and finishes at the Town Church. Protected Building The Parish Church of St. Peter Port, the island site upon which it stands and the walls, railings and gates which encompass it, and the Town Barriere, steps, railings together with the associated paved area extending into Church Square situated at the Quay and bordered to the north by Albion House and to the south-west by the Town Church were listed as a Protected Building by the States of Guernsey on 23 November 1970, reference PB712.

The plants are halophytes with not articulated stems and fleshy stem-clasping leaves. There are three species, occurring from the Mediterranean basin and North Africa to Southwest Asia and Central Asia.  Description  The species of Halopeplis are succulent annual ore perennial herbs with glabrous, not jointed plant stems. The alternate or nearly opposite leaves are fleshy, glabrous, globular or ovate, sessile and stem-clasping, with distinct or reduced leaf blades. The cylindrical spike-like inflorescences are standing laterally or terminally in the upper parts of the plants. In spirally arranged cymes groups of three flowers are sitting in the axils of fleshy bracts. The mostly bisexual flowers are immersed in the inflorescence axis and more or less connate to each other, to the bract, and to the axis. The inconspicuously three-lobed perianth consists of three connate tepals. There are one ore two (rarely three) stamens shortly exserting the flower, and an ovary with two stigmas. The fruit remains enclosed in the inflorescence axis, the fruit wall (pericarp) is membranous. The seed is ovoid to circular, compressed, with leathery, smooth or papillose seed coat. The seed contains the half-annular, uncinate or curved embryo and copious perisperm (feeding tissue).  Distribution and habitat  The distribution area of Halopeplis covers the Mediterranean region, North Africa, Southwest Asia, Central Asia to China (Xinjiang). The plants are halophytes and grow on wet salty soils at sea shores, lagoons, or inland at the edge of salt lakes and in saline mudflats.  Systematics  The genus Halopeplis was first published in 1866 by Franz Ungern-Sternberg. In 1857, Alexander Bunge had introduced the name Halopeplis, but without a valid description. The lectotype of the genus is Halopeplis nodulosa, which is a synonym of Halopeplis amplexicaulis. The genus Halopeplis comprises three species: * Halopeplis amplexicaulis (Vahl) Ung.-Sternb. ex Ces., Pass. & Gibelli: annual, occurring in inland salt flats and at salt lakes, distributed in the southern Mediterranean Basin and in North Africa. * Halopeplis perfoliata (Forssk.) Bunge ex Asch. & Schweinf.: perennial, occurring at sea shores from the Red Sea, Sinai Peninsula, Arabian Peninsula, to southwestern Pakistan (Baluchistan). * Halopeplis pygmaea (Pall.) Bunge ex Ung.-Sternb.: annual, occurring in inland salt flats and at salt lakes, distributed from the North Caucasus, Caspian Sea, southern Iraq, Iran, Central Asia to China (Xinjiang).

Early assessments of project dates back to 1989, when the first studies was conducted by the country's Central Engineering and Consultancy Bureau. The complex involves building a dam across Dalgolla Oya, and channelling water over a tunnel to Mathatilla Oya, both of which are tributaries of the Uma Oya. At Mathatilla Oya, another dam is constructed to channel of water per annum, via a headrace tunnel to the Uma Oya Power Station, where water then discharged to the Alikota Aru via a tailrace tunnel. The Alikota Aru is a tributary of the Kirindi Oya. The construction of the complex was inaugurated in April 2008 by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The total project cost is estimated to be approximately (approximately ), 85% of which is provided by the Government of Iran.  History  In 2008 Sri Lankan government began the project with Iranian funding and the foundation stone for the project without obtaining Environmental Clearance for the project. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report of the Uma Oya Project was prepared by the University of Sri Jayawardhanapura and was submitted in November 2010. During the 30 working days the EIA was open to the public for review and comments Central Environmental Authority received many letters from environmental organizations who called the EIA inadequate. However despite the objections CEP gave clearance for the project.  Puhulpola Dam  Puhulpola Dam under construction in March 2018.

The dam creates the Dyraaba Reservoir (DR) which has a gross storage of and active storage of . Water from the reservoir is channelled through a long circular pressurised-flow headrace tunnel measuring in diameter, which has a discharge capacity of . To build the tunnel, a long TBM was used to displace approximately of earth. = Uma Oya Power Station = The two pelton turbine generators of are fed via a vertical pressure shaft, after passing through the long tailrace tunnel. of earth was cleared to create the underground Uma Oya Power Station cavern. The power station will generate up to per year. The switchyard premises is built at above MSL. Power from the switchyard is delivered over of double-circuit 132KV transmission line, consisting of more than 70 transmission towers, to the Badulla Substation. The annual discharge of approximately of water from the power station is distributed out via a cross-basin tailrace tunnel for agriculture use on or existing land and of new lands, including irrigation of 14 separate tanks.  Impact  The project is considered as one of the worst environmental disasters in Sri Lanka. It has been called the \\"Multi- destructive\\" project due its large negative effects. As a result of the project houses began collapsing, land surfaces cracking, wells and brooks drying up, residents being displaced and losing their traditional livelihood. Many mass protests were launched against the project by residents affected by the Uma Oya disaster. It was revealed that impact of this Uma Oya project mainly because of bad Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report. The Rajapaksa regime has also been accused of corruption in the project. Critics have accused that Rajapaksa used the project as an cover up to misuse funds. The costs of the project was increased by USD 248 million which resulted in the Irrigation ministry secretary who refused to sign the agreement resigning and his successor started the project despite heavy opposition. Uma Oya Project temporary stop under Ranil Wikramasinghle Government. Due to the delay of contraction of Uma Oya Power Station, Government had to impose four hours per day power cuts & sign agreement to purchase electricity from private sector at huge cost.

His brother went to West Germany in 1959. On the evening of October 5, 1961, he attended a company party of the Reichsbahn. There he came into conflict with a supervisor, where he tore off the Shoulder marks of his Reichsbahn uniform. He was then fired on the spot.

Bowman claimed to cure all disease with herbs and a vegan diet based on various pseudoscientific claims, and denied that HIV caused AIDS. He set up a treatment center in Honduras, then moved his practice to New York City and Los Angeles. Numerous entertainment and acting celebrities were among his clients, including Michael Jackson. Although he used the title and name Dr. Sebi, Bowman had not completed any formal medical training. He was considered a quack by licensed doctors, attorneys, and consumer protection agencies in the United States. He was arrested being accused by New York state of practicing medicine without a license. After a Supreme Court trial Bowman was acquitted of all charges. He was later charged in a civil suit that resulted in his being prohibited from making therapeutic claims for his supplements. In May 2016, Bowman was arrested in Honduras for money laundering, after being found carrying tens of thousands of dollars in cash with insufficient accounting for its origin. During several weeks' detention in jail, he contracted pneumonia. He died in police custody as he was being transported to a hospital. Biography =Early years= Bowman was born in 1933 in Ilanga, Honduras, and was of African descent. He first learned of herbal healing and related traditional practices from his grandmother. His grandfather was an immigrant from Haiti. As an adult, Bowman identified as an \\"African in Honduras\\", not as an African Honduran. Bowman became dissatisfied with Western medical practices in treating his own illnesses such as asthma, diabetes, impotency and visual impairment and visited an herbalist in Mexico named Alfredo Cortez who confirmed to him that he was dying. whom Bowman claimed healed him. After that, Bowman began his own healing practice in Honduras. He developed a treatment that he called the \\"African Bio-Electric Cell Food Therapy,\\" and claimed that it could cure a wide range of diseases, including cancer and AIDS, as well as a variety of chronic conditions and mental illnesses. He also developed related herbal products. Bowman set up a center in the 1980s near La Ceiba, Honduras, and marketed his herbal products in the United States. He called his center the USHA Research Institute, located in the village of Usha. Bowman relocated to New York City in that decade, where he encountered legal opposition to his medical and therapeutic claims. He said his supplements could cure AIDS. He relocated his center to California. =Career= According to McGill University, Bowman's diet and food therapy was based on the discredited alkaline diet. His beliefs on the origin of disease denied germ theory and factored in faux-afrocentric claims about the unique genetic characteristics of Africans and their diaspora. He gradually earned considerable revenue, more than $3000 a day, after giving advice and developing a wide range of celebrity clients, such as Lisa Lopes, Steven Seagal, John Travolta, Eddie Murphy and Michael Jackson. He reportedly treated Jackson before he went to trial in 2004 on charges of child abuse (of which he was acquitted). In the early 1980s, AIDS had newly been recognized as a disease as an epidemic started in the United States, with numerous cases in New York and other major cities. Bowman claimed that HIV is not the cause of AIDS and used herbal remedies to treat people. In 1987, Bowman was arrested and charged in New York with practicing medicine without a license. The jury acquitted him, saying the state had failed to prove he made a medical diagnosis. In the 1990s, he was sued in New York for making claims of therapeutic benefits for his products; as a result of the civil case, he was prohibited from making such claims. He relocated to Los Angeles, where he cultivated celebrities among his clients. =Arrest and death controversy= On 28 May 2016, Bowman and his associate Pablo Medina Gamboa were arrested on charges of money laundering at the Juan Manuel G√°lvez de Roatan Airport, after they were found to be carrying $37,000 in cash and had no explanation for it. They were attempting to transfer from a commercial flight from the United States to a private plane for another destination in Honduras. Bowman was released pending a court hearing on 6 June 2016, but he was re-arrested by the Public Ministerio on money laundering charges. He was held for several weeks in a Honduran prison, while his family was attempting to obtain his release. He fell ill and, after police officials realized the severity of his condition, they transported him to a hospital. Bowman died of complications of pneumonia on 6 August 2016, en route to Hospital D'Antoni. The length of his time in custody and the poor condition of the jail may have contributed to his death. Some of his followers question the circumstances of his arrest and death. They claim that there was a conspiracy to silence him because his teachings differed from the medical establishment and threatened the pharmaceutical industry. Personal life Bowman identified as African, not an \\"African Honduran\\", but an African in Honduras. He was known to have been married twice and, at the time of his death, he had 17 living children. Lawsuits In 1987, the New York State Attorney General charged Bowman with two counts of practicing medicine without a license after he placed ads in local newspapers claiming to be able to cure AIDS. The Attorney General's Office sent undercover agents to his office to gain diagnoses and treatments for purported symptoms of disease. Bowman was acquitted because jurors said the tape recorded by the agents failed to show that Bowman had made a medical diagnosis of their purported conditions. In an effort to stop Bowman's false claims, the New York Assistant Attorney General for consumer fraud filed a civil suit against Bowman, his Ogun Herbal Research Institute, and other named businesses. It resulted in a consent agreement by which he was prohibited from making therapeutic claims for his products. He was also fined $900. The suit had ruled that the claims were unsubstantiated. =Alfredo Bowman and Dr. Sebi LLC v. Michael Jackson= In 2004, Bowman reportedly treated Michael Jackson prior to his being tried on counts of child abuse. Bowman claimed to have helped the singer overcome addiction to painkillers Demerol and morphine with his African Bio-Electric Cell Food Therapy. He worked with Jackson for six months at a retreat in Aspen, Colorado. After Jackson's brother Randy paid Bowman $10,000, Bowman sued Michael Jackson for related costs, claiming that the singer owed him $380,000, and seeking an additional $600,000 in lost revenue for having deferred other clients and various speaking engagements. Raymone Bain, a publicist of Jackson, denied that her client received any \\"professional treatment\\" or that he had any painkiller addiction. The case was dismissed in 2015 for lack of prosecution. Legacy *In 2018, African- American rapper Nipsey Hussle stated he was planning on creating a documentary about Bowman's successful defenses at his criminal trials. Hussle was later murdered in 2019 by a known acquaintance with whom Hussle had an altercation earlier on the same day, Eric Holder.https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la- me-ln-nipsey-hussle-murder-transcripts-20190627-story.html Law enforcement have found no link between Hussle's death and Bowman.

La Musique vue par les Peintres. Lausanne: Edita S. A., p. 140. of music visualization. Since the 1970s Ox has produced works in response to diverse musical sources, including Gregorian chant, the classical concert tradition and the sound poetry of Kurt Schwitters.Porges, Maria. 1996. ‚ÄúJack Ox.‚Äù Artforum International. Vol. 34, No. 10, Summer 1996, p. 113. The primary goal of Ox's work is to create an intimate correspondence between visual and musical languages. She has also worked with the composer Alvin Curran. In the catalog of Ox's 2003 Visualizing Music exhibition at the Museum of Art in Lodz, Poland, critic David S. Rubin explained the core principle of Ox's work as \\"...a desire to bond visual and aural information ... the impetus for the artistic journeys of Jack Ox since 1977, the year that she began basing her paintings and drawings on musical compositions. Trained in both visual art and musicology, Ox has over the past twenty-five years been developing mathematical systems for analyzing music and then 'recomposing' it in a language of her own invention.\\" Swiss art historian Phillipe Junod discussed Ox's work in his 1988 book, La Musique vue par les Peintres (Painters Look at Music).Junod, Philippe. (1988) La Musique vue par les Peintres. Lausanne: Edita S. A., p. 140. Junod describes the early projects in which Ox worked with the music of Bach, Stravinsky, and Debussy, before creating a cycle of paintings based on the eighth Bruckner symphony. Ox began this work in 1983, completing it eight years later in 1991. Junod emphasizes the conceptual rigor of Ox's work, developing each of Bruckner's symphonic themes. Each painting in the suite covers a sequence of ten to twenty measures. The vertical divisions of each painting correspond to Bruckner's time segments. Ox analyzed the musical structure of the symphony Ox, Jack, (1993), \\"The Systematic Translation of Anton Bruckner's Eighth Symphony into a Series of Thirteen Paintings\\". In Wessely, et al (Eds.),Bruckner-Symposion Linz 1990 (pp 83-101, 343). Linz, AUS: Anton Bruckner Institute Linz. as the basis of artwork that would successfully translate the composer's score and sound into a visual medium. To prepare the work, Ox executed numerous drawings from the score to create a visual translation using flexible but accurate equivalences that combine figurative and formal speculation. For Junod, Ox's methodic consistency combines formal rigor with conscious subjectivity. He states that Ox's approach represents the confluence of two distinct traditions in an original synthesis. The Saint Florian Abbey provides the thematic visual material of the paintings. This baroque architecture corresponds to the contrapuntal language that inspired Bruckner. The abbey itself was part of Bruckner's life. The painted images also include the nearby Alpine landscape, linked to the romantic nature of the composer's music. The formal correspondences in these paintings emerge from a personal system that transcribes tonal relationships through a precisely calculated analogy between the color wheel and the circle of fifths. While this process avoids a rigid correlation of color and pitch, the subtle play of color variations and values suggest each modulation by using carefully layered glazes. The effects of transparent glazing preserve the polyphonic dimension on the symphony, and the linear composition reflects rhythmic and melodic elements. Junod's description of the process used in the Bruckner paintings mirrors the work done for other painted series before and since. These include Debussy, Nuages, Stravinsky, Symphony in Three Movements, and Clarence Barlow, Im Januar am Nil. The Barlow music was visualized in The Virtual Color Organ.Ocvirk, Otto, & al], [et.

In 1993 Jack Ox discovered a recording of Kurt Schwitters himself performing the full Ursonate. A Dutch engineer apparently made the recording in the 1960s from an earlier recording once held in the archives of Westdeutsche Rundfunk. The original recording no longer exists and the precise date of the recording is unknown. Ernst Schwitters, the artist‚Äôs son, who granted permission for the recording firm Wergo to published the record, authenticated this unique recording of Schwitters.

It was the opening film at the 2015 SKIP CITY INTERNATIONAL D-Cinema FESTIVAL and was also screened at the 2015 Tokyo International Film Festival. The film's theme song is by Glim Spanky. Plot Rikutaro Maehara lives alone with his mother Yayoi in Kawaguchi, Saitama. Yayoi is a hostess at a hostess club. Rikutaro's father, who was an iron founder, died some years ago. When his mother marries Kon Nishino, a divorced man whom she met at the hostess club, Rikutaro suddenly finds himself with a new father, as well as with a sister, Mariko. As the house is small, the children have to share a room, a situation neither of them is happy with. Since Mariko is of the same age as Rikutaro she is put in the same class at primary school. There they are teased by some of their classmates, who call Mariko Rikutaro's 'fake sister' and his 'new wife' as, because of their parents' marriage, they now share the same surname. Embarrassed, the children decide to engineer a divorce between Yayoi and Kon, to which purpose they sign a pact drawn up by Mariko. First they try to persuade Kon that the marriage was a bad idea by spoiling the food and suggesting that the ghost of Rikutaro's father might be haunting the house. When this fails, Mariko puts on lipstick and kisses her father's shirt so as to suggest that he is having an affair. Yayoi sees Mariko with the lipstick, however, and then helps her apply another colour that 'suits her more'. She subsequently gives Mariko the lipstick. Gradually, the children begin to bond. Rikutaro shows Mariko the Shinto Shrine in Kanayama-cho where he and his father used to pray to the Kami of metal production, and takes her to the foundry where his father used to work. There, he introduces her to Takashi Iizuka, who was one of his father's colleagues, and gives her a piece of iron from the foundry that he polished. Mariko's kiss on Kon's shirt proves to have been prophetic, however. Kon, who has found a job at a real estate agent, starts staying away until late at night, leaving the children to their own devices. The film heavily implies that he is having an affair with a colleague from work. Yayoi, however, only finds out that Kon does not come home after work when Mariko comes down with a fever and Rikutaro calls her at the hostess club, not knowing what to do, and unable to reach Kon. Kon refuses to tell Yayoi what he does at night, claiming that 'she would not understand'. The children briefly run away together, to one of Mariko's favourite childhood spots. There, she reveals to Rikutaro that a letter in which her biological mother promises to visit her was actually written by herself. The children then share another moment of bonding, pretending that they can enter different worlds by running through a tunnel. The last world they visit is one in which they have grown up and 'do not have to be alone'. When Yayoi and Kon find the children, Yayoi shows her relief at having found them, while Kon only scolds his daughter. On the busride home, Mariko refers to Yayoi as 'mother' for the first time. Soon afterwards, a row takes place between Kon and Yayoi. Seemingly wanting to leave the house, Kon, who has been drinking, tries to pull Mariko out of her bed. Mariko tells her father that he is hurting her, and both children shout our for Yayoi, referring to her as 'mother'. When Yayoi tries to help Mariko, Kon roughly pushes her against the cupboard. Alerted by the neighbours, the police come. Yayoi tells them it was nothing, and eventually they leave. Mariko, however, shouts that Yayoi was hurt by her father. In the last scene, Kon packs up his car and drives away with Mariko, who is holding the lipstick Yayoi gave her and the piece of iron that she was given by Rikutaro. When Kon asks her what she is looking at her answer is 'her family'. Cast * Tomoko Tobata as Yayoi Nishino * Jyonmyon Pe as Kon Nishino * Taishi Sato as Rikutaro Nishino * Mau Konishi as Mariko Nishino * Sugi-chan as Takashi Iizuka Title The title refers to a scene in the film in which Takashi Iizuka tells Rikutaro that he, as a 'child of iron' is strong enough to pull through, in spite of the adversity. Source and themes The film is a semi-autobiographical depiction of life in a dysfunctional family. Taking his own childhood experiences and those of his once-stepsister Mariko, Koki Fukuyama produced a basic script which he subsequently polished with professional writer Kaori Moriyama. In a February 2016 Q&A; session, Koki Fukuyama stated that the film is about 'trying to survive and do one's best in situations that you really can't do anything about', both in the case of the children and their parents.

During this era of electrification, there were often difficulties with metal connecting elements of conductors. Trained electrician Karl Pfisterer focused on this problem and developed improved electrical fittings. Demand for Pfisterer fittings rose steadily. By 1927, the company had grown to employ a workforce of 54 and relocated to Augsburger Strasse 375, where it would be headquartered for the next 60 years.Source: Connect 02/2006, page 4 In 1937, Karl Pfisterer expanded his business segment to include fittings for high-voltage overhead cables and switchgear connectors. He patented an anchor clamp for steel-aluminum cables. Karl Pfisterer also developed the forging technique for non-ferrous metals and acquired the first test machines for his own development experiments. The company adopted the legal form of Kommanditgesellschaft (KG: limited partnership) in 1940. In 1942, company founder Karl Pfisterer died. His son, Walter Pfisterer, continued his father's work, as the company's personally liable partner and sole managing director. During an air-raid on Stuttgart on December 9, 1944, the production facility in Stuttgart-Untert√ºrkheim was completely destroyed. =From the post-war period to the present= The company was rebuilt in the 1950s. In 1954, a new factory was completed in Inselstrasse in Stuttgart-Untert√ºrkheim. Founded in Malters, Switzerland, in 1957, SEFAG was the first branch outside Germany. History of SEFAG (in German) The company began using plastics on an industrial scale in 1962 with the new plant in Winterbach. In 1968, Pfisterer invented the compact screw terminal, which became the technical standard used to connect all new builds in Germany to underground power networks from the end of the 1960s.Source: Herter Eberhard, \\"Elektrotechnik in W√ºrttemberg\\", B.G. Teubner Stuttgart, Leipzig, 1998. The following year, Pfisterer received the patent for compact fuse disconnector strips for low-voltage distributors and used them in plastic distributing cabinets, a new development at the time. Pfisterer: Forschung und Innovation In 1971, Karl-Heinz Pfisterer the son of Walter Pfisterer, joined the company as the third generation of the family. Pfisterer stepped up its investments outside Germany in the 1970s. The company's international reputation for erecting overhead transmission lines led to an unusual contract: To link the elements of the glass roof of the Munich Olympic Stadium, Pfisterer developed and manufactured special connectors. In 1975, which marked the company's 50th anniversary, Pfisterer received the patent on its Connex cable connection system for medium-voltage applications. Pfisterer : ‚ÄûKabelsysteme ‚Äì Kabelgarnituren f√ºr Mittelspannungsnetze‚Äú (PDF) This enabled medium-voltage connections to be installed as modules with factory-tested components. Pfisterer Holding AG was founded in Winterbach in 1986. Following a restructuring initiative, the administrative headquarters were located in Stuttgart-Untert√ºrkheim, parts manufacturing in Gussenstadt, and assembly in Winterbach. New application areas were added in 2000. Pfisterer expanded its activities to include transport technology, new energy sources, and industrial applications. In rail engineering, the low-voltage Plug system, Pfisterer: PLUG Stecksysteme (PDF) which transmits high currents in adverse environmental conditions, was deployed for the first time. Today, almost every state-of-the-art high-speed train is equipped with this system. In 2001, Pfisterer gave up its offices in Stuttgart-Untert√ºrkheim and relocated the company's headquarters to Winterbach. In 2004, the Pfisterer Group pooled its areas of activity in four international centers of expertise: cable systems (Winterbach, Germany), components (Gussenstadt, Germany), SWP, ‚ÄúVoller Energie in die Welt‚Äù overhead systems (Malters, Switzerland), and railway catenary systems (Barcelona, Spain). In 2015, Pfisterer launched its comprehensive Next Level growth and innovation program.

Major fish dishes includes ilish, butterfish (pabda), rui (rohu), pangas catfish (pangash), clown knifefish (chitol), walking catfish (magur ), barramundi (bhetki) and tilapia. Meat consumption includes beef (tehari), mutton (kacchi), lamb, venison, chicken (murgi), group duck , squab, koel and pigeons. Lentils/Pulses (legumes) include at least five dozen varieties. The most important are Bengal gram (chhola), pigeon peas, red gram, black gram (biuli), and green gram (mung bean). Pulses are used almost exclusively in the form of dal, except chhola, which is often cooked whole for breakfast and is processed into flour (beshon). Various green vegetables and fruits are available. Gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, citrons and limes, green and purple eggplants, red onions, plantains, broad beans, okra/lady finger, banana tree stems and flowers, lotus roots, green jackfruit, red pumpkins, and mushrooms are to be found in the vegetable markets or kacha bazaar or sabji bazaar. = Spices = Bay leaves, cumin powder, cumin, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garlic, onion, ginger, black pepper, chili powder, nigella, mustard and fenugreek seeds are common spices. Mustard oil and vegetable oil are the primary cooking media, although sunflower oil and peanut oil are also used. Clarified butter (ghee) is used for its aromatic flavors. Panch foron is a general purpose spice mixture composed of fenugreek seeds, nigella seeds, celery seeds, cilantro seeds, and black mustard seeds. This mixture is more convenient for vegetarian dishes and fish preparations. The use of spices for both meat and vegetable dishes is quite extensive and includes many combinations. The combination of whole spices, fried and added at the start or finish of cooking as a flavoring is special to each dish. Whole black mustard seeds and freshly ground mustard paste form a typical combination. A pungent mustard sauce called kashundi is sauce for snacks or sometimes makes a base ingredient for fish dishes and vegetable dishes. = Meals = Each dish is eaten separately with a small amount of rice or ruti, so that individual flavors can be enjoyed. The typical meal includes sequences of dishes. Two sequences are commonly followed, one for ceremonial dinners and the other for day-to-day eating. Both sequences have regional variations, and sometimes differences are significant for a particular course. Ceremonial occasions may employ elaborate serving rituals, but professional catering and buffet-style dining has become common. The traditions have not disappeared; large family occasions and the more lavish ceremonial feasts continue the traditional rituals.  Dishes  Mirzapuri foods contain staples, such as rice and flat breads. Different traditional flat breads include luchi, porota, bakhorkhani, nan, ruti, rice flour flatbread and chitai pitha. Meat dishes, as well as dal (a spicy lentil soup) and vegetables commonly accompany the breads. Traditional dishes can be 'dry', such as gosht bhuna. Items with jhol (gravy) are often curried. Vegetables are also used for light curries. On special occasions, guests receive Biryani and Borhani (spicy drink that is known to aid digestion). Chutney is mainly served at the end of a meal. It is & sour thickened curry usually made with local seasonal fruits, such as raw mango, jujube, gooseberry or tamarind with panch poron and sugar. The last item before the sweets Doi (baked yogurt). It is generally of two varieties, either natural flavour and taste or Mishti Doi (sweet yogurt), typically sweetened with charred sugar. This brings about a brown colour and a distinct flavour. = Desserts = Bengalis invented a variety of sweets. Most of them were created by a Ghosh (a dessert maker or dairy product seller caste). The most common sweets and desserts include: Rasgulla locally pronounced :Roshogolla\\" or \\"Rashgolla\\", is made with channa (posset/curdled milk) and sugar syrup. It is one of the most widely consumed sweets. The dish has many regional variations. Rosgolla Channer shondesh is created with milk and sugar. (Bengali: ‡¶∏‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂). Some recipes call for the use of chhena or paneer (which is made by curdling milk and separating the whey from it) instead of milk itself. Sandesh Chhanar mishti is made from chickpea flour with sugar/jaggery/molasses. Various types are available across Bangladesh. Mishti doi is sweetened homemade creamy yogurt prepared by boiling milk until it is slightly thickened, sweetened with sugar, either brown sugar (gud/gur/mithai) or date molasses (khajuri gud/gur/mithai), and allowing the milk to ferment overnight. Naru it is usually home-made and used as offerings in Hindu rituals. Rosh-malai are small rashgollas in milk base. Khaja deep fried sweets are made from wheat flour and ghee, with sugar and sesame seeds as the coating. Mua is made with rice flakes and jaggery. Hawai'i Mithai is made with sugar and given various forms. Chhana is fresh, unripened curd cheese made from water buffalo milk. Chhanar jilapi is similar to regular jalebi except that they are made with chhana. Khir is a rice pudding made by boiling rice, broken wheat, tapioca, or vermicelli with milk and sugar. It is flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios or almonds. Kheer Phirni together with zarda, is typical during Shab-e-Barat and Eid. It is cooked with dense milk, sugar/jaggery, and scented rice (kalijira rice). Although it takes a lot of time to cook, it is a favorite Mirzapuri dessert. A thicker version of khir is used as filling for pitha. Gurer Shondesh is a fritter made from rice flour and palm sugar. Goja is a light, sweet snack made from flour and sugar, and often served as street food, which is consumed both as dessert and starter. Chomchom (‡¶ö‡¶Æ‡¶ö‡¶Æ) (originally from Porabari, Tangail District), goes back centuries. The modern version of this oval-shaped sweet is reddish brown in colour and has a denser texture than r√¥shogolla. It can be preserved longer. Granules of mawoa or dried milk can also be sprinkled over ch√¥mch√¥m. Shemai is made with vermicelli prepared with ghee or vegetable oil. Muktagachar monda is a traditional sweetmeat. First made in 1824, it is known for its originality and taste. Peda (‡¶™‡ßá‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ) is from India. It is usually prepared in thick, semi-soft pieces. The main ingredients are khoa, sugar and traditional flavorings, including cardamom seeds, pistachio nuts and saffron.Mirzapurer Rosona Bilash, By Mrs. Jannatul Ferdouse, Page 24-25. Balushahi is made from a stiff dough made with all-purpose flour, ghee and a pinch of baking soda. One-inch-diameter (25 mm), 1‚ÅÑ2-inch-thick (13 mm) discs are shaped with hands, fried in ghee or oil and dunked in thick sugar syrup to form a sugar coating. They are sweet, but tasty with a slightly flaky texture. Rabri is condensed milk based dish made by boiling the milk on low heat for a long time until it becomes dense and changes its color to pinkish. Sugar, spices and nuts are added to it to give it flavor. It is chilled and served as dessert. Rabri is the main ingredient in several desserts, such as rasabali, chhena kheeri, and khira sagara. Rabri can also be made savoury with salt, masala, and zeera. Rabri The tradition of making different kinds of pan-fried, steamed or boiled sweets, lovingly known as pi≈£he or pitha still flourishes. These little balls of heaven symbolise the coming of winter, and the arrival of a season where rich food can be included. The richness lies in the silkiness of the milk, which is often mixed with molasses or jaggery made from either date palm or sugarcane, and sometimes sugar. They are mostly divided into different categories based on the way they are created. The most common forms of these cakes include bhapa steamed (pi≈£ha), fried (pakan pi≈£ha) and dumplings (puli pi≈£ha), among others. The other common pithas are chondropuli, pati shapta, chitai pi≈£ha and dudh puli. Generally, rice flour goes into making the pitha. = Beverages = Common beverages are sugarcane juice with jaggery (akher gur or shorbot), sugarcane juice (akher rosh), Borhani (a spicy drink usually served in gatherings, banquets and weddings), whisked salted milk (ghol), date palm juice (Khejur Rosh), tea, malai, faluda, mango juice (amer shorbot), watermelon juice (tormujer shorbot), juice of Bengal, quince or wood apple (bel er shorbot) and lemon-lime juice (lebur shorbot).  Religion  The local population is composed of roughly equal parts Muslim and Sanatani Hindu. Adherents to each co-exist peacefully to the point of participating in the ritual customs of the other, including religious festivals and weddings. Religious conflicts are 0.00%. The population is 60% Sanatan and 40% Muslim.Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, Statistics Division, Ministry of Planning, Govt. of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.

It was built from 1868 to 1879. It is also known as Springsure Hospital. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Springsure Hospital was constructed in , as a response to the needs of the local community. In 1844 Ludwig Leichhardt traversed an area to the east of what is now Springsure, naming the Expedition Range, Albinia Downs and Comet Creek as he went. Some two years later Major Thomas Mitchell entered the area and named further features in the classical style (such as Salvator Rosa) while the following year Leichhardt attempted to explore the area again but was forced back by floodwaters. While the Leichhardt Pastoral District was officially opened up to settlement on 10 January 1854, William Landsborough subsequently in 1858 explored the Comet River through to the area that is now Springsure. In 1863 surveyor Charles Frederick Gregory laid out the plan for Springsure, the town reserve taking in an area of 50 square miles centred on the springs of Springsure Creek. As pastoral enterprises proved successful, more and more settlers streamed into the area and by the time the 1864 census was taken the Springsure Police District recorded a total of 720 persons, 619 of them male, with only 34 of the 720 people actually residing in the township of Springsure. By the late 1860s it became apparent that a hospital was needed in the district. The Springsure Hospital was erected as a response to needs of the local community who set up a committee of volunteers to manage the project. The hospital was to be run by governors, each governor to subscribe a minimum of one pound per year towards the running of the hospital. From those subscribers, a committee responsible for the affairs of the hospital was to be elected, the committee to be composed of a president, a secretary and other officers. On 7 October 1868, William Henry Hinton, Louis Meyer and George Pultney Malcolm Murray were appointed trustees. Patients able to pay for their treatment would be required to do so whereas those unable to afford treatment would receive the medical care required regardless. In 1868, the hospital was opened. Its feature characteristics were those of the pavilion plan, a plan first designed and implemented in France in the mid 19th century. The Lariboisiere Hospital had opened in Paris in 1854. Following promotion of the pavilion plan by Florence Nightingale who recognised its advantages for the recovery of soldiers suffering from the effects of the Crimean War, almost all hospitals constructed in Queensland in the 1860-1880 period were built to incorporate the features of the pavilion plan. The principal design characteristics of the pavilion plan were to provide good ventilation and sanitation for the benefit and recovery of patients. The Springsure Hospital was no exception and today is the oldest surviving hospital constructed on the pavilion plan in Queensland and is the first hospital constructed in inland Queensland. The hospital was erected as a small cottage type hospital that incorporated the pavilion plan ward with other facilities including an office, surgery, dispensary and a store within the one main building. At its inception the hospital comprised a brick building with a shingle roof with its main section housing a ward that accommodated six beds. To promote cross ventilation, French doors were located along the northern and southern sides of the main ward, with a verandah encircling three sides of the ward. Each of the beds was positioned between each set of French doors to ensure that the patients were afforded adequate ventilation. Initially a husband and wife team, Thomas and Ellen Cahill were appointed as wardsman and matron and continued in these positions until the mid 1870s. In 1871 the census for the Springsure Police District recorded 1098 people, 370 of whom were residing in the township of Springsure. In that year the doctor treated a total of 48 cases and the government \\"helped out\\" with a contribution of ¬£300. Accordingly in the 1870s the hospital was expanded to meet the growing needs of the community with an extra ward added in 1879 to bring the number of beds to seventeen. The Queensland Board of Health requested that the Hospital Board appoint a health officer at its own expense but the Board refused stating that a health officer was unnecessary as Springsure was a healthy and well-drained district. When banks crashed in the 1890s the Hospital Board had its money locked up and as a result was forced to arrange overdraft. Despite this by 1897 the Hospital Board was in a position to employ its first trained nurse, Miss Alice Kemp and in 1900 as a response to a Queensland Government requirement that Boards take positive action Dr Neilson was appointed health officer at a cost of ¬£25. Despite the hospital having been in operation since the late 1860s it was not until 1902 that the deeds to the land were received. The 1884 Health Act made local governments responsible for the treatment of infectious disease, mainly because of the miasma theory of disease transmission, which blamed infectious diseases on noxious vapours arising from poor sanitation and bad drainage - both local government responsibilities. This also gave Councils responsibility for inoculations such as the program organised by the Bauhinia Shire Council in response to the 1919 flu epidemic. Councils were also expected to provide hospital wards for the treatment of infectious diseases. In 1920 the Bauhinia Shire Council provided ¬£200 to the hospital to make improvements to the isolation ward. Expansion continued apace with the erection of separate staff quarters in 1914. Improvements to the district's health services continued throughout the 1920s with establishment of an ambulance brigade and with Miss Hammond opening Westray as maternity home in 1921. As part of a statewide response by the government to the Maternity Act 1922 and as existing facilities were becoming less than adequate, in 1924 the Queensland Government constructed a maternity ward at the Springsure Hospital. In 1925 a new complex housing wards and a kitchen was constructed adjacent to the 1868 brick building. Although the Queensland Government was providing some health facilities for the Springsure community, in 1923 local authorities were expected to meet some of the shortfall between income and expenditure for their local hospitals through precepts, such as the ¬£100 provided in 1924 by the Bauhinia Shire Council. The Council continued to take responsibility for inoculation campaigns, providing diphtheria inoculations for the community free of charge in 1931. Local government responsibility for hospital finances only ceased after the Hospitals Act of 1945. When the Depression affected the financial status of the hospital to the point where it was likely to close a public meeting was called to make arrangements for a further input of voluntary contributions. Strong hostility towards the possibility that the hospital could come under the control of the state in the late 1930s instigated the Bauhinia Shire Council to pledge a ¬£400 per annum to ensure that the hospital continued to be maintained under the voluntary system. When a new hospital was constructed in 1938, the former hospital building was used for recreation and as a dance hall for the nurses. During the 1970s new staff quarters were erected and in the 1980s, when the original brick building was identified as being surplus to the needs of the Hospital Board, the site was subdivided. A reserve was created comprising the 1868 building and the adjacent 19th century timber annex. The Bauhinia Shire Council was appointed trustee.  Springsure Hospital Museum  Restoration work was undertaken in 1988 and on 19 August 1989, the Honourable Mike Ahern MLA, Premier and Treasurer of Queensland opened the Springsure Hospital Museum. The Museum is furnished to resemble an early rural hospital; it has a collection of medical equipment, photographs and other records. In 2004-2005 the Springsure Hospital Museum was closed to the general public for safety reasons. For Anzac Day in 2016, the museum hosted an exhibition about World War I including the letters written from the war front by the four Fryer brothers (William, Charles, Henry and John) from Springsure. The brothers were the sons of Charles and Rosina Fryer, who served as wardsman and matron at the Springsure Hospital. Charles was killed in 1917. One of the brothers who returned from the war, John (Jack) Fryer, resumed his studies at the University of Queensland but died of tuberculous in 1922. His fellow students donated ¬£10 to the University of Queensland to establish a collection of Australian literature in Fryer's memory. In 1927, this collection grew into the Fryer Memorial Library, now an extensive archive of published and unpublished material relating to Australian literature, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies, and the history, art and architecture of Queensland. 2018, the museum is open to the public on Tuesday and Thursday 9 to 12 noon. However, people wishing to visit outside these hours may obtain a key from the Central Highlands Regional Council office in Eclipse Street.  Description  The former Springsure Hospital, now the Springsure Hospital Museum, is situated at 13 Woodbine Street, Springsure, located adjacent to the present Springsure Hospital. The building demonstrates the principal characteristics of a Queensland hospital in that it stands on elevated ground away from the town centre. The Victorian Georgian style building is substantially intact and consists of a single storey brick building with an attached timber annex. The main brick building constructed c. 1868 comprises two sections. The western section is the former six-bed ward designed on the pavilion plan. Offices and a storeroom are located within the eastern section and a verandah extends the full lengths of the main elevation, the western elevation and part of the northern elevation. The building is constructed of locally manufactured bricks in English Bond style with stonework forming the foundations beneath floor level. The stonework of the foundations has been used to level the floor of the main building, as there is a fall in slope to the west; the eastern section of the building is at ground level, the western section is on timber stumps. The main room that is the former ward area demonstrates the principles of the pavilion design with its promotion of sanitation and cross-ventilation. The ward is designed to accommodate six beds of single depth against the walls each bed would have had a French door between it and the next bed. There are three French doors, each with a window above on each of the southern and northern elevations, each of the doors opening to the verandah. The building has three fireplaces, a feature that is rare for Central Queensland. Two of the fireplaces are in the ward, the third in the former office. The eastern section of the main building comprises two rooms on the south and two small rooms with an open passage between on the northern side. A modern toilet is located on the northern verandah. Quoins are a feature of the main building on the western side and sash windows feature flat arches and keystones. Gothic style scalloped timber bargeboards decorate the steeply pitched roof of the main building; the roofline over the verandahs is a less steep pitch, the entire roof being of corrugated iron overlying well preserved wooden shingles. The annex is situated immediately to the west of the main building and is of two rooms with a verandah along the eastern elevation with a decorative spandrel along its western edge. The timber-framed building weatherboard clad and roofed with corrugated iron features external framing on the southern and eastern elevation. The grounds in front of the complex are landscaped with native shrub and trees.  Heritage listing  Springsure Hospital Museum was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Erected , the former Springsure Hospital is important in demonstrating the development of health facilities in 19th century Queensland. The hospital was erected as a local initiative and managed by a voluntary committee. The building is significant in that it illustrates the rapidity with which the principles of the pavilion plan were adopted in Queensland. The first hospital constructed to the pavilion plan had only opened in Paris in 1854. The plan had only become widely accepted in Britain in the mid 1860s following the efforts of Florence Nightingale and others to promote the advantages that the plan incorporated for the sick. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Springsure Hospital is significant as a rare surviving example of a hospital complex erected in the 19th century. Of more than 90 public hospitals erected in Queensland in the 19th century, only ten buildings are known to survive. Within this group, the former Springsure Hospital complex is the only example of a small cottage type hospital that combined a small pavilion ward with other facilities in the one main building. Not only is the former Springsure Hospital the first inland hospital constructed in Queensland it is also Queensland's oldest surviving hospital designed on the pavilion plan. While an extensive number of pavilion plan hospitals were constructed, few have survived development in the 20th and 21st centuries. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. With its verandah encircling three sides of the main ward and with French doors to the northern and southern sides of the building, creating cross ventilation, the former Springsure Hospital is significant as a good example of the pavilion plan design which aimed to promote cross ventilation and sanitation for the benefit and recovery of patients. Not only does the hospital incorporate the latest hospital design of its time it was also adapted to take into account the climatic conditions of inland central Queensland. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former Springsure Hospital, now the Springsure Hospital Museum, is valued by the community for the role it played in the establishment of health services and in the provision of medical training facilities. The site is important to the people of Springsure and surrounding area for its role as the principal site of public health care, the birth, life and death of the people of the area and in providing recreational facilities following its decommissioning as a hospital. Such facilities were valued not only for their functional role in caring for the sick, but also as symbols of progress and as evidence of civilising forces at work. The former Springsure Hospital is valued by the community as one of the earliest surviving buildings in the district.
