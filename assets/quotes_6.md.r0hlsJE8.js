It was conceived by Alain Georges (a.k.a. Doctor Mad) and a group of engineers and musicians who started to work on it in 1998. As opposed to other devices and/or software pieces in the same application field, the music composing technology behind the MadPlayer was not loop-based but rather composed of multiple layers of algorithms that eventually generated each note for each instrument, chosen on the basis of music genre definitions. An embedded synthesizer technology was in charge of producing the music based on the generated score. According to Alain Georges, \\"the name 'MadPlayer' came from the fact that the 'songs' that were created from scratch by the technology were based on algorithms (rules) uniquely dependent on the music genre that a user picked, and at some point of experimentation [it was] decided just for fun to create a new 'music genre' that would mix all the algorithms from all the styles. [As can be guessed], this could yield to pretty wild results, and sometimes sounded like they had been composed by a mad man. I thus called this genre the 'Mad' style, and quickly found the commercial name for the composing device: the 'MadPlayer'.\\" The device used SmartMedia memory cards from which it could play a number of different audio media types such as MP3, MIDI and KAR karaoke/MIDI files. Its feature list included: * Infinite music composer * MP3/wav/WMA/mid file player * MIDI synthesizer/expander * MIDI/Audio mixer * real-time voice input mixing (with effects) * karaoke player (displaying lyrics in real time) * sound recorder * internal + external flash memory * USB interface * analog audio input/output * digital audio output * FM radio * firmware upgradable with new music genres, features, algorithms, … Madplayer won a number of awards and was highly regarded for its inventive design, powerful tools, and quality of included sequences, but was also regarded as confusing to use. According to Alain Georges, a non-exhaustive list of awards included: * Finalist, Best New Product, and Best Product Development Team, 2004 International Business Awards * Finalist, Best New Product, 2003 American Business Awards * CES 2002 Innovation Award Honoree * Apple Expo, Paris – 2002 – Best of Show * Most Innovative Product of Show 2001, Mainstream Audio Tech TV The device originally sold for $200 but dropped in price to $100 by some retailers like Fry's/Outpost.

Plot Rafe and Victor are two truckers who have had a bad run of luck. The film begins with the two rushing through traffic to get a pregnant woman to the hospital whilst avoiding a repo man after their truck. They then go their boss, who chastises the pair for yet another missed deadline. Their boss then says they have one final chance, from the company Tech Star which is scheduled to ship barrels of toxic waste to California. As a safeguard against the brothers' supposed incompetence, their boss installs a countdown time on their dashboard, a.k.a. \\"the foul-up clock\\", to remind them of the deadline. Victor and Rafe travel to Tech Star, which is a company that uses child geniuses as slave labor. One such slave, named Holly, has invented a device that activates and deactivates electronics by code, and looks like an ordinary remote control. While the brothers are loading their truck, Holly stows away in the cab, having learned the shipment is destined to the same place where her fiancee lives. She is soon discovered, and while Rafe and Victor agree to protect her, they fail to understand her invention. They spent the night in a Texas motel, nearly eluding Dr. Bruekner, the CEO of Tech Star, and his hired goons, who attempt to recapture Holly as her invention is Tech Star property. Later, the brothers' truck stalls on the railroad tracks as a train is approaching. Holly struggles to remember the right code to restart the truck's engine with her invention, doing so at the last minute, but the trio fails to realize that she inadvertently entered a code that reprogrammed the foul-up clock. Arriving in California, the trio is captured, and Holly destroys her invention. As they are making their way to her boyfriend's house, Victor presents Holly with the invention. Unaware how that can be, the brothers realized something like this may have happened and switched her invention with an ordinary remote from the motel. She praises them for their foresight, but when they arrive, her boyfriend remarks they still have a couple of hours to make the delivery. Rafe remembers the ship is to depart at 7, not 9, and the foul-up clock \\"fouled up\\"! The pair rushes to the dock, but miss the ship. To make matters worse with their evident termination, the repo man who was after them at the beginning successfully repossesses their truck. However, in doing so, he failed to realize that the toxic barrels from Tech Star were still inside, and does not show proper precautions, rupturing the barrels and releasing them chemicals. He realizes too late what has happened when his hair starts falling out in tufts. Holly, however, markets her invention and makes considerable amounts of money. She then partners with Rafe and Victor into making their own transportation company. The film ends with the brothers getting a CB message from Holly about a client, and set off in a brand new tractor trailer to begin their shipment.

It is one of the three primary forks of the Flathead River, the main inflow of Flathead Lake and a tributary of the Columbia River via the Clark Fork River and the Pend Oreille River. The river is sometimes considered the upper headwaters of the Flathead River, although the North Fork is its official name in the U.S. Other naming conventions for the river include Flathead River - North Fork, North Fork of Flathead River, and North Fork of the Flathead River. The river originates in a valley northeast of Lake Koocanusa in the Clark Range, and flows west. It then meets the Continental Divide and turns south, winding through a broad glacial valley. The river then crosses the Canada–US border into the state of Montana, where it begins to delineate the western boundary of Glacier National Park. Roughly following the \\"inner\\" and \\"outer\\" North Fork Roads and Montana Secondary Highway 486, the river winds southwest past Kintla Lake, Bowman Lake, Quartz Lake, Logging Lake, and Lake McDonald, then turns west and south into a narrower valley before joining the Middle Fork Flathead River near the southwestern entrance of the national park, several miles northeast of Columbia Falls. Less than below this confluence, the combined river joins the South Fork Flathead River, forming the main Flathead River. Wild and Scenic River designation Aerial view of North Fork Flathead River (August 2013), roughly from the south. The river runs roughly from top center to bottom center. The transverse portion of the river near the middle of the image is south of Demers Ridge. Although the North Fork is designated as a National Wild and Scenic River (1975) in the United States, its greater length in BC (, not including headwaters forks) is not. Water in the BC section remains relatively pure as there are no permanent residents or livestock in this drainage north of the border. Dam proposal In the 1940s the Glacier View Dam was proposed, which would have flooded much of the river's valley between Glacier View Mountain and the Canada–US border. Supported by Flathead Valley interests, the dam and reservoir were opposed by the National Park Service, as between and of park lands would have been flooded. The proposed dam was cancelled by 1950.

Biography Pheung is of Chinese descent, and was born near Kokang's Red Rock River (红石头河) in 1931. He was the oldest of seven children. In 1949 he studied military affairs under Sao Edward Yang Kyein Tsai, the saopha of Kokang at that time, and became the captain of Yang's defense force, where he remained until Yang's was deposed by the Myanmar Armed Forces (the military junta ruling Burma) in 1965. Later that year he established the Kokang People's Revolutionary Army and began leading a small group of youth in guerilla warfare against the Myanmar Armed Forces, at which time his younger brother Pheung Kya-fu also became a military leader. In April 1969, Kokang province was established with Pheung as its leader. For 20 years he controlled Kokang as a member of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB). In 1989, however, the CPB split up and Pheung established his own army, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, with which he mutinied and captured the city of Mong Ko. After this he signed a cease-fire with the military junta, which allowed the Kokang army to retain their weapons, and established an autonomous Kokang region as the \\"First Special Region\\" of Myanmar. Pheung has played a large role in drug production in Burma. According to Bertil Lintner, he established the first heroin factory in Kokang during the 1970s and continued trafficking heroin for at least 20 years. In 1990, he legalized opium planting in Kokang. Later, however, he said he opposed the drug trade: in a 1999 talk to journalists and narcotics experts he said he was working on \\"purging the area of opium\\", and that he had been trying to end the opium trade for 10 years. The Kokang government declared the region \\"drug-free\\" in 2003. The central government and narcotics experts, however, still suspect the region of being involved in the drug trade. The cease-fire with the military junta was broken in August 2009 after the government sent troops to conduct a drug raid on a factory suspected of being a drug front, and on Pheung's own house. At the same time, Pheung was challenged from within the army, as his deputy Bai Suocheng and others were said to have become loyal to the junta. The confrontation with junta troops eventually led to violent conflict (the Kokang incident); Pheung himself was driven out by his competitors from within the army and is rumored to have fled, after a warrant was issued for his arrest. He reappeared in an interview with Global Times, a newspaper backed by China's Communist Party, in December 2014. He said that he would retake Kokang from Myanmar army control. Armed clash between his troops and Myanmar armies erupted in February 2015 with an initial heavy causality of Myanmar Government.http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/13108-tnla-arakan- army-join-kokang-fight.html He is known to have close ties to Asia World's Lo Hsing Han, a former opium kingpin, and his son Steven Law (Tun Myint Naing), and is believed to have investments in Singapore through them.

In modern times, some Christian churches reject this idea, although others still espouse and teach this view. Early Christianity In the fifth century, Augustine wrote The City of God, in it making Christianity's first overall condemnation of suicide. His biblical justification for this was the interpretation of the commandment, \\"Thou shalt not kill\\", as he sees the omission of \\"thy neighbor\\", which is included in \\"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor\\", to mean that the killing of oneself is not allowed either.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suicide/#ChrPro Michael Cholbi in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on Suicide, section 2.2 The Christian Prohibition The rest of his reasons were from Plato's Phaedo. In the sixth century AD, suicide became a secular crime and began to be viewed as sinful. In 1533, those who died by suicide while accused of a crime were denied a Christian burial. In 1562, all suicides were punished in this way. In 1693, even attempted suicide became an ecclesiastical crime, which could be punished by excommunication, with civil consequences following. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas denounced suicide as an act against God and as a sin for which one could not repent. Civil and criminal laws were enacted to discourage suicide, and as well as degrading the body rather than permitting a normal burial, property and possessions of the suicides and their families were confiscated.  Protestant views  (\\"If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.\\") has often been discussed in the context of the fate of those who die by suicide. Modern Catholicism According to the theology of the Catholic Church, death by suicide is considered a grave matter, one of the elements required for mortal sin. The reason is that one's life is the property of God and a gift to the world, and to destroy that life is to wrongly assert dominion over what is God's and was held as despair over salvation. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states the Church’s teaching with regard to suicide as contrary to the Fifth Commandment : The Catechism states that the person who died by suicide may not always be fully right in their mind and thus not completely morally culpable. The Catholic Church prays for those who have died by suicide, knowing that Christ shall judge the deceased fairly and justly. The Church also prays for the close relations of the deceased, that the loving and healing touch of God will comfort those torn apart by the impact of the suicide. Formerly, those who died by suicide were denied a Christian funeral. Pope Pius X said: \\"In the Fifth Commandment God forbids suicide, because man is not the master of his own life no more than of the life of another. Hence the Church punishes suicide by deprivation of Christian burial.\\"Pope Pius X. Catechism of Saint Pius X.

Forming from an area of low pressure on September 26, 18W was first monitored by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) as a tropical depression. Tracking generally towards the west, deep convection gradually developed around the system and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on the depression early on September 28\\\\. Although the depression initially struggled to maintain deep convection, it eventually became better organized and was upgraded to a tropical storm on September 29 by the JTWC. Several hours after reaching this intensity, the system began to rapidly dissipate as its inflow and outflow were severely disrupted by two nearby storms, Parma to the west and Melor to the east. The cyclone fully dissipated near Guam early on September 30 before being absorbed by Typhoon Parma. Ahead of the system's arrival in Guam, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued by the National Weather Service. On September 29, a state of emergency was declared by Governor Felix P. Camacho and relief funds were allocated in case of damage after the storm. Due to the low-intensity of the storm, it had little impact on Guam. Only increased winds and moderate rainfall were reported. Meteorological history The storm originated from an area of low pressure on September 24 that formed roughly 725 km (450 mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei. Deep convection had developed in association with the low and was beginning to wrap around the center of circulation. By September 26, the system had developed strong outflow and was intensifying. Later that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the low as a tropical depression. The following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on the depression. At this time, it was being steered towards the west in response to a mid-level ridge to the north. Little intensification took place as convection barely deepened around the low-level circulation; however, the JTWC anticipated the system to intensify into a tropical storm within 24 hours. Although conditions for intensification were present, convection associated with the depression weakened significantly by September 28\\\\. Forecasts for the system became increasingly complicated due to the formation of Tropical Depression Nineteen-W to the east-south-east. Later that day, the motion of the storm shifted to the west-northwest in response to a subtropical ridge north of the depression. The center of circulation had become nearly devoid of convection late on September 28, with only the western portion of the system featuring shower and thunderstorm activity. By the morning of September 29, convection redeveloped around the center of 18W and the JTWC determined that the system had intensified into a tropical storm, with winds peaking at 65 km/h (40 mph 1-minute sustained). However, in post storm analysis, the JTWC determined that the depression had not intensified into a tropical storm and lowered the peak wind-speeds to 55 km/h (35 mph). Around the time the system was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC, the JMA assessed it to have reached its peak intensity as a strong tropical depression with winds of 55 km/h (35 mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 999 mbar (hPa). Struggling to maintain deep convection, the system's inflow and outflow patterns became severely disrupted by two intensifying cyclones, Parma to the west and Melor to the west. The combined effects of the two other storms eventually left the center of 18W devoid of convection as it approached Guam. As it passed near the island, the storm rapidly dissipated, first weakening to a depression and then losing its low- level circulation. It was no longer considered a tropical cyclone a few hours after brushing Guam. This coincided with the issuance of the final warnings from the JTWC and the JMA. Preparations and impact Typhoon Parma (left), Tropical Depression 18W (center) and Tropical Storm Melor (right) on September 30 Several hours after being classified a tropical depression on September 29, the National Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for the islands of Guam and Rota. Later that day, the watches were upgraded to warnings as 18W intensified into a tropical storm. The same day, the emergency operations center on Guam was fully activated. Public schools on the island were closed by officials until further notice. Although warnings were issued for the Mariana Islands, most residents did not heed warnings. Stores selling supplies such as plywood, lumber, nails, screws, batteries and butane stoves reported only a slight increase in sales. There were also no sales of flashlights and generators ahead of the system. Although most did not prepare fully, one resident told news reporters \\"We haven't been hit in a while so...I'm going to prepare.\\" Twelve shelters were opened across the island; however, they did not have supplies and people were advised to bring at least three days worth of food and water. Weather radar loop of Tropical Depression 18W's rainbands passing Guam shortly before dissipating Just prior to the arrival of the storm, Governor Felix P. Camacho declared a state of emergency for the island of Guam and allocated $250,000 in funds for relief efforts. A tropical cyclone condition of readiness (TCCOR), a warning scale used by the military on the island, was placed at level one, the highest on the scale. Rota was also placed under a TCCOR at level 3. By the afternoon of September 29, roughly 250 residents had sought refuge in shelters across the island. All flights to and from Guam were canceled and the Team Anderson Air Show was rescheduled. Five ships and a submarine from the United States Navy moved out to sea to avoid the storm; however, one submarine was unable to leave and remained at port during the storm. A total of 100 people from the Red Cross disaster team were deployed in Guam to prepare for any damage caused by the storm. During the storm, the National Weather Service issued an urban and small stream flood advisory due to the likelihood of heavy rains. Late on September 29 through the morning of September 30, 18W brought high winds and heavy rains to Guam and nearby Rota as it tracked between the two islands. Shortly after the storm passed by, the Governor Felix Camacho issued a press statement lowering the TCCOR to level 4. All tropical storm warnings were also canceled at this time. With this, shelters began to scale down operations and were set to close at 5:00 pm local time on September 30.

He is known from a number of objects, including his (now lost), Theban tomb chapel Tomb A.24. He started his career as a wab priest in the temple of Amun and a porter of the god's processional shrine. In the 20th regnal year of Amenhotep he was already the Fourth Prophet of Amun, which means he was the fourth highest ranking priest in the most influential priesthood of the era. He was appointed Second Prophet in Year 34, it is likely that the previous holder of the title, Anen, the pharaoh's brother-in-law died around this time. Simut was also treasurer (“Overseer of the House of Silver”) and “sealer of every contract in Karnak”. His son also served Amun, as a wab priest. He is depicted in the Theban tomb of Vizier Ramose among the mourners. His own tomb was discovered in the nineteenth century, but its location has since been lost.Lise Manniche: Lost Tombs, A study of Certain Eighteenth Dynasty Monuments in the Theban Necropolis, London and New York, , p. 93-99  References  Sources * David O’Connor, Eric H.

History  The villa once belonged, among the others, to the Sartorio dynasty originally from Sanremo. A branch of the family moved in 1775 to Trieste as part of its business expansion. Pietro Sartorio moved from Sanremo to Trieste with his family and bought the house, which had previously belonged to the merchant family Faraon, originary from Alexandria of Egypt. The last heir of the Sartorio family, Baroness Anna Segrè Sartorio, left the villa and all its furniture to Trieste's city council with the explicit wish to make it a public museum.

She was the second editor of the Girl's Own Paper, but became best known for her Flower-Patch series of books of anecdotes, autobiography and nature description. Life Flora Klickmann was born on 26 January 1867 in Brixton, London, one of six children of German-born Rudolf Klickmann and his wife, Fanny Warne. The family moved to Sydenham in south London when Flora was in her teens.Charles Miles, Flora Klickmann and the Flower Patch, The New Record (Journal of the Forest of Dean Local History Society), no.27, 2013, pp.19–23Biography of Flora Klickmann at The Orlando Project Biographical article by David Starling at StellaBooks.com She aspired to be a concert pianist, and studied at Trinity College of Music and at the Royal College of Organists. However, she was found to be suffering from arrhythmia, and was advised to rest. She travelled to the small Gloucestershire village of Brockweir in the Wye valley, where her mother's family lived, before returning to London. The illness she suffered from was quinsy, a complication of tonsillitis. At the age of 21 she began writing on musical subjects for Sylvia's Home Journal and other magazines aimed at women, and by 1895 had started contributing articles and interviews with musicians to The Windsor Magazine, one of the best-known story periodicals of the time. Her mother died in 1903, when they were living at Ondine Road, East Dulwich, and her Prussian-born father, Rudolph Klickmann, remarried in 1908 and went to live in Battersea with his new wife – a Russian emigre. Flora stayed in the house in Dulwich until her marriage. In 1904, she became the editor of The Foreign Field, a magazine published by the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. By this time, she had also begun writing and editing books on crafts and etiquette, aimed at young girls. Four years later, in 1908, she was appointed editor of the Girl's Own Paper, in succession to its first editor, Charles Peters. This was a highly successful periodical aimed at girls and young women, published by the Religious Tract Society (RTS). The magazine moved from a weekly to monthly format, and she introduced new themes such as careers advice for girls, advice on style and dress, photography competitions and crafts. Long serials became less common, and their place was taken by a larger number of shorter stories, often from distant parts of the world. In 1912 she suffered a breakdown through overwork and stress. While remaining as editor, she spent a period of convalescence at a rented cottage close to Brockweir.Monmouthshire County Council, Popular Walks Around Tintern, 1999 In June 1913, she married a widower, Ebenezer Henderson Smith (1851–1937), one of the executives at the RTS; her married name was Emily Flora Henderson Smith. The wedding was at St John the Evangelist, on Goose Green, East Dulwich. Their marital home was 'Hillthorpe' on Sydenham Hill; it was pulled down in the 1950s. The couple also purchased a second house at Brockweir, Sylvan View (now Sylvan House). In May 1916 she published the first of a series of books of written sketches of life in her country cottage at Brockweir, known in her books as \\"Rosemary Cottage\\", with its idyllic cottage garden and spectacular views over the River Wye and Tintern Abbey. The book, The Flower-Patch Among the Hills, was based on articles which she had originally written for the Girl's Own Paper, and was highly successful; a reprint was needed after two weeks. She acquired a succession of cottages in the area over the years. In later years the stories grew to involve her household and the local people, combining nature description, anecdote, autobiography, religion, and humour. In all, seven Flower Patch books were published, over 32 years. Her writing has been described as \\"humorous, elegant and beautifully observed, revealing a genuine love and concern for the natural world\\". A keen environmentalist, she wrote of the virtues of gardening without artificial chemicals and the value of natural fertilisers long before they became fashionable, and decried the taking of wild flower bulbs. She also published novels, advice books, children's stories and non-fiction on many topics including gardening, cooking, and needlework techniques, some of which have been republished in recent years. She remained editor of the Girl's Own Paper until 1931, when she and her husband retired permanently to Brockweir. However, she continued to write Flower Patch books until 1948. She lived an increasingly reclusive life after her husband's death in 1937. She died in 1958, and was buried in the graveyard of the Moravian Church at Brockweir.

It stars Gregory Peck, Jack Warden and Desi Arnaz, Jr. Filmed on-location in Israel, Billy Two Hats is from a script by Scottish writer Alan Sharp, the screenwriter of Rob Roy and Ulzana's Raid. Plot Following a bank robbery in the American west, the partner of Scottish outlaw Arch Deans is killed and his young Indian half breed friend Billy Two Hats is captured. While Billy is being transported, Deans gets the drop on Sheriff Henry Gifford at a remote trading post, enabling Billy to escape. As they flee, the sheriff's friend, the trading post owner, named Copeland, takes down his old long-range buffalo rifle and fires a shot that kills Deans' horse, breaking his leg. Billy builds a travois on which Deans can ride, dragged behind Billy's horse. Billy and Deans encounter Spencer and his wife, Esther, at their remote homestead. Deans persuades Spencer to take him in his wagon to get horses on the condition that Billy stay with Esther to protect her and the homestead from marauding Indians. Billy is also to keep a look out for the pursuing Gifford. Billy and Esther spend their time together talking and develop romantic feelings for each other. Esther, a young mail-order bride from the East, is unhappy with her older abusive husband. She falls in love with the young good looking Billy. Gifford finds the two in bed together, assumes Billy raped the woman, becomes enraged, and beats him. Esther attempts to explain but can't because she stutters uncontrollably when distressed. Deans and Spencer encounter trouble on the trail, four drunken Indians demand whiskey from them, ambush their wagon in a canyon, killing the horse and besiege them. Spencer is killed. Gifford, Esther and Billy then set out after Deans. They find Deans near death. With Esther's help Billy kills Gifford. Deans dies of his wounds. Not believing in burying the dead, Billy places his body in a tree atop a hill, Indian fashion. He and Esther ride off together.

Variety. November 7, 1973. 19. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and wrote, \\"When the action turns, as inevitably it must, to conversation between Peck and Arnaz, 'Billy Two Hats' becomes vapid.

Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 15. John Raisbeck of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Like Ulzana's Raid, also written by Alan Sharp, Billy Two Hats is a film of hunters and hunted, centring on the father/son relationship; only here the traditional roles are reversed, with the grizzled Deans (Gregory Peck wrestling unsuccessfully with a Scottish accent) having to lean on his resourceful young companion.

It first appeared in the April 1954 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction and has been reprinted a number of times, in Operation Future (1955), Far Out (1961), and The Best of Damon Knight (1976).Index to Science Fiction Anthologies and Collections  Synopsis  Len and Moira Connington are expecting a baby; Len teaches high-school chemistry and hopes for a promotion. Moira begins to act strangely; it seems as if someone else, a child, is sometimes speaking through her mouth, and she develops aversions to alcohol and coffee. Eventually they realize that the unborn baby, Leo (who named himself for Leonardo da Vinci), is communicating with and through the mother. Leo's intellect develops quickly; soon he is demanding that Moira read German so that he can learn it. At a soiree with the school superintendent, Leo objects to Moira drinking tea, and causes her to spill it on the superintendent's wife's lap. Len's teaching contract is not renewed. By his eighth month, Leo is requiring Moira to work her way through texts on biology, astrophysics, modern literature, etc. He decides he wants to write a novel; he dictates the first chapter - an historical novel, which Moira titles \\"The Virgin of Persepolis\\" - and Moira sends it to a publisher under a pen name. After two weeks the publisher sends a book contract and an advance for nine hundred dollars. Leo continues dictating, until several chapters are completed. Then he loses interest. Len asks the reason. Moira says Moira attempts to complete the novel on her own. She goes into labor. Leo realizes what is happening and objects, but in vain. He is born as a normal baby.

Its drainage basin lies to the east of the South Fork Flathead River and the Hungry Horse Reservoir. Towns along the river include West Glacier, Nyack, Pinnacle, Essex, and Nimrod. The river's headwaters lie in the Bob Marshall Wilderness at the confluence of two small streams, Strawberry Creek and Bowl Creek. From there, it runs north, receiving many tributaries from glacial valleys to the east and west, most of them inside Glacier National Park. The river begins to parallel U.S. Highway 2 as it winds north-northwest, and after a long and narrow course, the river enters a wider valley and begins to spread out and braid between meadows and forested slopes. It then enters another narrow gorge, turning generally westwards, then passing the southwestern entrance of the national park, receives a tributary from Lake McDonald, a large glacial lake to the north, from the right. The river then proceeds southwest to meet the North Fork Flathead River, southwest of West Glacier and northeast of Columbia Falls, forming the main stem of the Flathead River, which eventually flows into the Clark Fork River (the Pend Oreille River).

The public string could include an email address, domain name, or a physical IP address. The first implementation of identity-based signatures and an email-address based public-key infrastructure (PKI) was developed by Adi Shamir in 1984,Adi Shamir, Identity-Based Cryptosystems and Signature Schemes. Advances in Cryptology: Proceedings of CRYPTO 84, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 7:47--53, 1984 which allowed users to verify digital signatures using only public information such as the user's identifier. Under Shamir's scheme, a trusted third party would deliver the private key to the user after verification of the user's identity, with verification essentially the same as that required for issuing a certificate in a typical PKI. Shamir similarly proposed identity-based encryption, which appeared particularly attractive since there was no need to acquire an identity's public key prior to encryption. However, he was unable to come up with a concrete solution, and identity-based encryption remained an open problem for many years. The first practical implementations were finally devised by Sakai in 2000, and Boneh and Franklin in 2001. These solutions were based on bilinear pairings. Also in 2001, a solution was developed independently by Clifford Cocks. Closely related to various identity-based encryption schemes are identity based key agreement schemes. One of the first identity based key agreement algorithms was published in 1986, just two years after Shamir's identity based signature. The author was E. Okamoto. Identity Based key agreement schemes also allow for \\"escrow free\\" identity based cryptography. A notable example of such an escrow free identity based key agreement is the McCullagh-Barreto's \\"Authenticated Key Agreement without Escrow\\" found in section 4 of their 2004 paper, \\"A New Two-Party Identity-Based Authenticated Key Agreement.\\" A variant of this escrow free key exchange is standardized as the identity based key agreement in the Chinese identity based standard SM9. Usage Identity-based systems allow any party to generate a public key from a known identity value such as an ASCII string. A trusted third party, called the private key generator (PKG), generates the corresponding private keys. To operate, the PKG first publishes a master public key, and retains the corresponding master private key (referred to as master key). Given the master public key, any party can compute a public key corresponding to the identity ID by combining the master public key with the identity value. To obtain a corresponding private key, the party authorized to use the identity ID contacts the PKG, which uses the master private key to generate the private key for identity ID. Limitation Identity-based systems have a characteristic problem in operation. Suppose Alice and Bob are users of such a system. Since the information needed to find Alice's public key is completely determined by Alice's ID and the master public key, it is not possible to revoke Alice's credentials and issue new credentials without either (a) changing Alice's ID (usually a phone number or an email address which will appear in a corporate directory); or (b) changing the master public key and re-issusing private keys to all users, including Bob. This limitation may be overcome by including a time component (e.g. the current month) in the identity.

Description A long and narrow lake, about 4 kilometers in length, it lies downstream from Lough Derravaragh, close to Lough Owel. It is a renowned bird and wildlife sanctuary, and also known for its coarse fishing. The level of the lake has dropped dramatically since the 1960s due to drainage of the Inny; this has led to the development of freshwater marshes on large areas of the lake bed.Lough Iron, Ramsar Information Sheet, wetlands.org Lough Iron is not easily accessible as there is no road close to the lake or public access. Taking a boat down the River Inny is the only option. History and etymology Local landowner and antiquarian Sir Henry Piers, writing in the 1680s, described a traditional story of the lake's origin: :\\"Its name need not be Englished, but, as tradition goeth, it hath it on this occasion; it is said, that of old here was no lake at all [...] a country farmer passing near, chanced to drop his plow-irons, which he was carrying to the forge, into the brook; hence it got a name, which in the Irish tongue sounds, the Iron-brook; this name held still, when the water prevailed over the low ground, the name was altered to that of the Iron-lake. This story I confess looks somewhat oddly\\"Collectanea de rebus hibernicis, Volume 1, L. White: Dublin, 1786. p. 38 Despite his reservations, Piers added that \\"at the northern end of the lake, where the Inny runneth into it (as aforesaid) in a fair, calm and clear summer's day, you may be able to trace the old channel of the Inny, and plainly discern in eight or ten foot of water, the ancient banks the river had, on both sides thereof, before it overflowed and drowned all.

In 2007, Frank Martin Gill, an openly gay man, had petitioned the circuit court to adopt two boys that he and his partner had been raising as foster children since 2004. Gill was prohibited from adopting by a 1977 Florida law prohibiting adoption by gay men and lesbians in that state.ACLU, \\"In re: Gill - Case Profile\\", January 19, 2011. After a four-day trial challenging the law, on November 25, 2008, Judge Cindy S. Lederman declared the ban violated the equal protection rights of the children and their prospective parents under the Florida Constitution, and granted Gill's adoption request.Almanzar, Yolanne, \\"Florida Gay Adoption Ban Is Ruled Unconstitutional\\", New York Times, November 25, 2008. The state of Florida appealed the trial court decision.Morales, Ileana, \\"Gay Adoption before Florida Legislature, courts\\", Associated Press, April 29, 2009. Oral arguments were heard by a three judge panel of the Florida Third District Court of Appeal on August 26, 2009.Anderson, Curt \\"Fla. gay adoption ban goes to appeals court\\", Associated Press, August 26, 2009. The district court upheld the trial court's ruling in favor of the plaintiffs on September 22, 2010, and the state declined to pursue any further appeals, thus effectively nullifying the anti-gay adoption statute. The Florida Legislature undertook comprehensive adoption reform in 2015, repealing the 1977 ban on homosexual adoption, which the state had not enforced since 2010.Gay adoption ban stricken from Florida laws after four decades Background Florida adoption cases In 1977, at the peak of the anti-gay Save Our Children campaign led by Anita Bryant to repeal a Miami-Dade human rights law, the Florida Legislature enacted a law prohibiting adoptions by homosexuals.2010 Florida Statutes, section 63.042(3), accessed 8 July 2011: \\"No person eligible to adopt under this statute may adopt if that person is a homosexual.\\" Several attempts were made in the state legislature to repeal the adoption ban, and there were several unsuccessful challenges in Florida courts, including: * Seebol v.

Johnson (1997) In 1999, the issue was heard in federal court for the first time when the case of Lofton v. Kearney was taken to the United States District Court in South Florida, which upheld the state law in August 2001.Lofton v. Kearney, United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Key West Division, 30 August 2001 The case was appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit. In May 2002 while the Lofton case was pending, eight former state legislators who voted for the 1977 ban, including the former Senate President and House Speaker, repudiated the law. Former representative Elaine Bloom said, \\"The hysteria of the times led us to do the wrong thing.\\"\\"'We Were Wrong,' Say Former Legislators Who Voted For Florida Gay Adoption Ban Nearly 25 Years Ago,\\" American Civil Liberties Union press release, May 17, 2002, accessed July 16, 2011 Furthermore, in June 2003 the U. S. Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas struck down all remaining sodomy laws nationwide as being unconstitutional violations of the due process rights of gays and lesbians. However, in January 2004, the appeals court ruled against Lofton, finding that the adoption ban did not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process.Lofton v.

In 1992 a lesbian couple had filed suit (Matthews v. Weinberg 645 So. 2d 487) after the state removed a six-year-old foster child from their home on account of their sexual orientation. In 1994, the Florida Second District Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, holding that the Legislature had not prohibited homosexuals or unmarried couples from serving as foster parents. Thereafter, state child welfare workers placed numerous children (including victims of abuse or neglect, special needs children, and infants or toddlers with HIV or AIDS) with same-sex couples over the years, as was the case with the Gill family. As Judge Lederman noted: During the Gill trial, the Florida Department of Children and Families,Prior to reorganization in 1996, known as the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS). which operates the state foster care system, admitted in court that \\"gay people and heterosexuals make equally good parents ... that placing children with gay adoptive parents does not harm or disadvantage children emotionally or physically ... [and] that gay people could be the ideal placements for some children.\\" At that time, there were 3,535 children in state custody needing adoptive parents.\\"What Florida’s Department of Children and Families Says About The Ban,\\" American Civil Liberties Union, 2 November 2008, accessed 8 July 2011 Issue On December 11, 2004, the Florida Department of Children and Families placed two boys, who are referred to as John and James Doe in court papers, in the home of Martin Gill and his partner, who had previously fostered several other children. Four-year-old John and four-month-old James were only supposed to be with Gill temporarily, but plans for them to live with relatives fell through. In 2006, a judge terminated the parental rights of the boys' biological parents. Gill subsequently petitioned the Florida Department of Children and Families in October 2006 to adopt the boys, but although every assessment and home study showed that the boys were thriving under the excellent care of Gill and his partner, DCF denied the petition because it violated the law against adoption by a homosexual. With the help of attorneys provided by the American Civil Liberties Union, Gill filed a petition for adoption with the circuit court in January 2007, which held a four-day hearing on the case in October 2008. The Department of Children and Families was represented by attorneys from the state Attorney General's office. Judge Lederman found in favor of the plaintiff, Gill, and granted the adoption in her ruling on November 25, 2008. Circuit Court Over the course of a four-day trial before the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court of Florida in Miami-Dade County, both the petitioners and the state presented evidence relating to the best interests of the children involved as well as evidence related to the legitimacy of the ban on adoption by gay men and lesbians. A psychologist who evaluated the boys testified that it was in their best interests to be adopted by Gill, and that removing them from their home would be devastating. The boys' guardian ad litem, appointed by the court to represent their interests in the proceedings, called Gill and his partner \\"model parents\\" and their home \\"one of the most caring and nurturing placements\\" he had seen. The ACLU, representing Gill, called expert witnesses who cited studies that found no significant differences in the stability of same-sex relationships compared to opposite-sex relationships, and no significant differences in outcomes for children raised by same-sex parents versus opposite-sex parents. The state called Dr. George Alan Rekers, at the time an officer and scientific advisor of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), who presented research (some of which had already been discredited) finding that gay men and lesbians suffered higher rates of depression, anxiety, affective disorders and substance abuse than heterosexuals and that same-sex relationships were less stable than opposite-sex ones. The state also called a second expert witness, Dr. Walter Schumm, Associate Professor of Family Studies at Kansas State University, who conceded that a case-by-case assessment of potential adoptive parents who are gay or lesbian would be more appropriate than the current blanket exclusion. During the trial, Rekers testified that \\"gay people [are] mentally unstable and advised that the ban should be expanded to include Native Americans because, Rekers claimed, they are also at much higher risk of mental illness and substance abuse.\\"\\"Attorney General Bill McCollum's \\"Expert\\" Witness Caught with Male Prostitute,\\" Equality Florida, 4 May 2010, accessed 8 July 2011 However, in her ruling on the case Judge Lederman stated that the testimony of George Rekers \\"was far from a neutral and unbiased recitation of the relevant scientific evidence,\\" and that \\"Dr. Rekers' beliefs are motivated by his strong ideological and theological convictions. ... The court cannot consider his testimony to be credible nor worthy of forming the basis of public policy.\\" In her order granting the petition to adopt, Judge Lederman (who had presided over many child welfare cases as Presiding Judge of the Miami-Dade Juvenile Court since 1994) found that Florida's adoption ban violated the equal protection rights of Gill and the minor children without a rational basis for doing so. The court also found that the ban violated state and federal guarantees of the children's right to permanency.Gandossy, Taylor, \\"Judge overturns Florida ban on adoption by gays\\", CNN, November 25, 2008.

District Court of Appeal The Attorney General's office immediately announced its intention to appeal the ruling. In December 2008, lawyers for Gill and the children filed a motion requesting that the Florida Supreme Court take up the case immediately, which was denied. Oral arguments were heard by the Florida Third District Court of Appeal on August 26, 2009. Some observers believed the case would ultimately be decided by the Florida Supreme Court.Miller, Carol Marbin and Gonzalez, Gabriella \\"Florida's gay adoption ban now in hands of appeals court\\", Miami Herald, August 26, 2009.

In September 2010, Governor Charlie Crist, on the heels of announcing an LGBT rights-supportive platform for his candidacy for the United States Senate, announced that he was considering dropping the appeal. Both the ACLU and the director of the state's Department of Children and Families urged Crist to not drop the suit, saying that there needs to be a final judicial resolution that applies across the entire state. On September 22, 2010, the court unanimously struck down the ban as violating the equal protection guarantees of the Florida Constitution, stating: \\"The trial judge was entitled to reach the conclusion, which she did, that the Department's experts' opinions were not valid from a scientific point of view.\\" Governor Crist hailed the decision as \\"a very good day for Florida; it's a great day for children.

McCollum specifically hired psychologist George Rekers, a proponent of conversion therapy, as the state's star expert witness in defense of its anti-gay adoption law, and Rekers was paid nearly $120,000 for his testimony on behalf of the state. McCollum wrote in 2007: \\"Our attorneys handling this case have searched long and hard for other expert witnesses with comparable expertise to Dr. Rekers and have been unable to identify any who would be available for this case.\\" However, his choice of witness was criticized by Nadine Smith of the gay-rights organization Equality Florida: \\"Rekers is part of a small cadre of bogus pseudo scientists that charge these exorbitant fees to peddle information they know has been discredited time and time again. And people like McCollum will pay top dollar for it. There's a reason why he can't find credible sources. Because credible people don't believe this ban should exist.\\" In May 2010, Rekers became the subject of a sex scandal when the Miami New Times reported that he had been photographed at Miami International Airport with a 20-year-old rent boy, whom Rekers claimed to have hired merely as a \\"travel assistant\\" during a 10-day trip to Europe. The incident was subsequently covered by national and world media, leading Rekers to resign from the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality, where he had been a scientific advisor and officer. McCollum's credibility and judgment were questioned in the media, as well. The Miami Herald reported on June 5, 2010: Nevertheless, while awaiting the decision of the appeals court, McCollum told the Florida Baptist Witness on August 3, 2010, that he believed Florida law should be changed to exclude homosexuals from being foster parents as well as adoptive parents: > I really do not think that we should have homosexuals guiding our children. > I think that it's a lifestyle that I don't agree with. I realize a lot of > people do. It's my personal faith, religious faith, that I don't believe > that the people who do this should be raising our children. It's not a > natural thing. You need a mother and a father. You need a man and a woman. > That's what God intended. Asked about the Rekers scandal, McCollum said: > I would never have chosen Rekkers [sic] had I known what we now know today > ... Rekkers was not an authority on this issue. He was an authority in the > sense that he was a scholar. He did research into papers that other people > wrote. So he was able to be used to get into evidence these matters that we > needed. And it's unfortunate that all this publicity has come up over it, > but the lawsuit, I think, is on sound ground and we're carrying it forward. McCollum had announced his candidacy for governor in May 2009, but on August 24, 2010, McCollum lost the Republican primary election to Rick Scott, who was elected Governor of Florida in the general election the following November. He was succeeded in office as Attorney General by Pam Bondi on January 4, 2011. Statutory repeal of the adoption ban The Florida Legislature undertook comprehensive adoption reform in 2015. The legislation repealed the 1977 ban on homosexual adoption. HB 7013 passed the Florida House of Representatives on a 68-50 vote on March 11. On April 15, the Florida Senate passed the bill on a 27-11 vote.

Geography  Adlisberg mountain is located to the east of the city of Zürich, between the Glatt river valley and Lake Zürich. Its highest point is about above the Lake Zürich. The mountain range is part of a chain of hills — among them Käferberg, Forch and Pfannenstiel — between Greifensee (Lake Greifen) and Lake Zürich. On the southern and western flanks of the Adlisberg are located the Zürich quarters Hottingen, Hirslanden and Witikon. The upper part of Hottingen is called Dolder and is a residential quarter of Zürich. On a terrace on the north side of the city of Zürich are situated the hamlets Tobelhof, Gockhausen and Geeren; the latter villages of the city of Dübendorf.  Points of interest  It is a picturesque location and the lower western side of the hill is now part of the residential district of Zürich. The Zürich Zoo and FIFA's headquarters are located to the northwest, on the plateau between Adlisberg and the Zürichberg respectively the latter one on the southern flank of the Zürichberg. It is also the location of restaurants, hotels, among them the high-levelled Grand Hotel Dolder. At the Grand Hotel Dolder, a small golf course was built. Nearby, on the hilltop, sport courts are situated, among them a popular wave pool (Wellenbad Dolder), a mini-golf course,Dolder Sports a Curling hall, tennis clubs, a driving range, and the Dolder ice rink, built in 1930 and considered to be one of the largest artificial ice rinks in Europe. Waldschule Adlisberg aims at children, provided by the city of Zürich.Waldschule Adlisberg on the official website of the city of Zürich The upper part of the hill is mostly woodland and a popular recreational area for hiker and biker enthusiasts. On the eastern hilltop, above sea level, is a meter high observation tower located, Loorenkopf nearby Witikon, which offers a panorama over Lake Zürich, Pfannenstiel region and the Glatt Valley. On the northeastern side of the Adlisberg the ruins of the Dübelstein castle are situated; from 1487 to 1489 the home of Hans Waldmann, former mayor of the city of Zürich.  Transportation  The Dolderbahn rack railway runs up to the hilltop, and buses provided by the Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich (VBZ) run between Zürich and the neighbouring communities of Dübendorf, Fällanden and Maur, as well as the Tobelhofstrasse connecting the southeastern parts of Zürich with Glatt Valley and Pfannenstiel region.  Waldstadt  Sigmund Widmer, then Stadtpräsident (mayor) of the city of Zürich, in 1971 initiated the plans for the satellite town Waldstatt (also called Sigi-Ville) for about 100,000 inhabitants, comprising an area of about on the Adlisberg hill plateau. In addition to 30,000 relatively inexpensive housing, 230 classrooms, 10 double gyms, swimming pools, shops, cinemas, churches, a hospital, hotels, a convention center and theater, as well as a subway and underground motorway connections were planned. Thus a completely car-free settlement on the surface would have occurred, but the project was opposed, mainly for ecological reasons, and never realized.

The publication was succeeded by Workers' Life in January 1927 following a successful libel action against the paper. This was in turn replaced by The Daily Worker on the first day of January 1930. History Forerunners Workers' Weekly had its origins in the earlier press of the British revolutionary socialist movement. With the founding of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in August 1920, the constituent parties such as the British Socialist Party (BSP) and the Workers' Socialist Federation (WSF) ceased to exist as did the BSP's paper weekly newspaper, The Call. A new publication was established for the new political party called The Communist.James Kluggmann, History of the Communist Party of Great Britain: Volume 1: Formation and Early Years, 1919-1924. Page 213. The Communist began on 5 August 1920, just four days after the completion of the conference (the Congress of London) which founded the CPGB.Jane Ure-Smith, \\"The Establishment of a Bolshevik Newspaper in Britain in the 1920s.\\" International Socialism (London), no. 18 (Winter 1983), pg. 33. The publication continued without interruption until its 131st issue, dated 3 February 1923. The paper was in many ways a direct continuation of The Call, retaining the same look and style, the same editor, and even continuing the serialization of articles begun in the earlier publication. The first editor was Fred Willis, former editor of the BSP's weekly, assisted by Raymond Postgate. The paper maintained a circulation of between 8,000 and 9,000 during 1920, after which time the circulation began to rise rapidly due to improvements in the publication's design.Klugmann, History of the Communist Party of Great Britain, vol. 1, pg. 213. Francis Meynell took over as editor around the first of 1921 and by 5 February 1921, circulation stood at 25,000. Sales continued to rise throughout the year, touching the 60,000 mark at the time of the raid on party offices in May 1921.Klugmann, History of the Communist Party of Great Britain, vol. 1, pg. 214. Towards the end of April 1921, Member of Parliament J. H. Thomas successfully sued The Communist for libel, naming its editors, printer, and publisher in the action. The pressure of this legal action and subsequent raid of party offices by the police had the effect of making production of the paper extraordinarily difficult. The Independent Labour Party's printing house abruptly stopped production of an issue of the paper in midstream after coming to an agreement with the Director of Public Prosecutions not to produce any more Communist material. In July 1921, Postgate took over for Meynell as editor of The Communist. He continued in that role until giving way in favor of T.A.\\"Tommy\\" Jackson in May 1922.Klugmann, History of the Communist Party of Great Britain, vol. 1, pg. 215. By the Autumn of 1922, the print run of The Communist had declined to around the 20,000 mark, with actual sales in the vicinity of just 8,000. It was clear to Communist Party leaders that a drastic makeover for the publication was due. Establishment of Workers' Weekly In the Spring of 1923, the Communist Party of Great Britain felt itself at low ebb. Leading theoretician Andrew Rothstein minced no words in an article in the party's monthly theoretical magazine: > \\"What is the position of our party today? Despite the terrifying pictures > drawn by the Morning Post and the British Empire Union, we in the party know > to our cost, and do not conceal it...that our party numbers only some > thousands of members, of whom perhaps half are \\"active,\\" i.e., > propagandists, agitators, organizers, literature-sellers, writers, etc. The > party has not a great many more members than those organisations which were > represented at the first and second unity congresses in August 1920 and > January 1921....

The governing Executive Committee of the CPGB had decided to replace The Communist with a new publication called the Workers' Weekly. The first issue of the new paper was dated 10 February 1923. The change of name was to reflect a parallel change in the publication's approach, emphasizing the daily life and shop concerns of the working class as well as noteworthy events in the Labour Movement. In his article in the monthly theoretical magazine of the CPGB announcing the switch, Andrew Rothstein declared that the revamped publication was to mark a move away from being \\"a weekly journal for the orthodox Communist household\\" and towards becoming \\"a live reporter and interpreter of the working class life and struggle.\\"\\"Roebuck\\" [Rothstein], \\"The Party Organ,\\" pg. 571. R. Palme Dutt was editor of the revamped publication.Ure-Smith, \\"The Bolshevik Press in Britain,\\" pg. 51. Following the Comintern's emphasis of the day, the new paper attached particular importance to letters from worker-correspondents, publishing over 2,500 letters and reports submitted from the grassroots in its first year.Klugmann, History of the Communist Party of Great Britain, vol. 1, pg. 216. On February 17, 1923, the paper explicitly stated the change in direction: > \\"We want a paper made by the workers for the workers. Our news is working > class news supplied by the workers on the spot.

Trouble lay ahead, however, as at the end of January 1927 a successful legal action for libel forced the publication into bankruptcy. A new party paper was established at that time called Workers' Life, a publication which attained a circulation of 60,000 copies a week by that summer. In London on 1 January 1930, under a banner headline reading \\"Workers of the World, Unite,\\" a new daily newspaper of the Communist Party of Great Britain called The Daily Worker was born. It took the same name as the American Communist daily established in 1923.Noreen Branson, History of the Communist Party of Great Britain, 1927-1941. London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1985. Page 52.

The choir was established to perform choral music of the highest quality, a tradition it strives to maintain to this day. The repertoire includes traditional choral works as well as music by 20th-century and more contemporary composers. Derby Choral Union is a registered charity and an independent choral society. It promotes concerts in Derby, England, and the surrounding district, and has over 100 active members. The choir's Patron since 1993 is the internationally known soprano Dame Emma Kirkby; she was given the Award of the Queen's Medal for Music The Queen's Medal for Music in June 2011 – only the sixth person to have received this award. Former patrons have included Sir Charles Groves. Richard Dacey has been the Musical Director since 2003; previous musical directors have included Sir John Pritchard, Sir Henry Coward, Harold Gray and Raymond Thorpe. The choir performs mainly in Derby Cathedral and in recent years has also performed in Leicester (with the Leicester Philharmonic Choir) and at Merton College, Oxford as well as overseas. The choir performs with professional soloists and orchestras and mixes new music with its extensive repertoire of traditional works. The Choir commissioned a new work from Will Todd (\\"Song of Creation\\", 2000) to celebrate the Millennium. To maintain standards at the highest level, all new singers are auditioned; to encourage younger members, choral scholarships are offered for singers aged 25 years or younger. Reviews of most concerts are published in the music section of the Derby Telegraph, some of which can be seen on the choir's website.  Early years  In 18th-century England, Derby was no more than a reasonably-prosperous market town with a few pioneer industries established. The new idea of public concerts was first recorded on 3 September 1788 with a programme consisting mainly of music by Handel. It seems probable that the choir formed for this event remained in existence until the next known public concert held on 5 September 1793. But by the 1860s, the face of Derby was changing rapidly with the Midland Railway and other industries bringing prosperity to the town. In 1866, the New Market Hall – as a new artistic venture – was completed and officially opened on Tuesday 29 May 1866. The official ceremony took place in the morning and was followed by a performance of Handel's Messiah. The orchestra consisted of players from Nottingham, Birmingham, Leicester and Burton, as well as from Derby and district; the choir too was drawn from far afield but a local group also took part. At the performance, the combined strength of the choir and orchestra was 500. The local singers were \\"fired by their success\\" (according to page 4 of), and suggested the founding of a regular choral society. A meeting was held, at the invitation of the then Mayor, on 22 June 1866. This preliminary meeting decided to start the Derby Choral Union. A second meeting was called a week later, \\"for the purpose of receiving the names and entrance fees of any Vocalists who may wish to enrol themselves as Members of the [Derby Choral] Union\\". The first rehearsal of the new society was held on 21 September 1866, with an arrangement to hold weekly practices in the Old Assembly Rooms, Full Street. By this time the society had about 120 members. The Derby Mercury, dated 26 September 1866, recorded that: \\"We trust that the gentlemen of the Town will come forward liberally with subscriptions in aid of the society’s funds; for, although the Choral Union is to a certain extent self-supporting, it must be borne in mind that unless a goodly number of honorary members are enrolled the committee will not be justified in incurring the heavy expenses inevitable on a Grand Oratorio performance.\\" On 1 February 1867, the choir gave an \\"open rehearsal\\" of Handel's oratorio Judas Maccabaeus at the Corn Exchange. A second \\"open rehearsal\\", this time of Haydn's Creation, was given on 3 May 1867 to round off the first season's activities. In the interim, the choir had recruited many more members and the orchestra included, in addition to local players, \\"several members of Mr. Charles Halle's celebrated band\\". A total of 230 singers and players took part. The Derby Mercury of 8 May 1867 recorded this as an \\"unqualified triumph\\". After remarking that Derby could no longer be called an \\"unmusical town\\", it goes on: \\"not only was the largest hall in the town (the Corn Exchange) crowded to excess but we are informed that scores were turned away from the doors for whom the managers were unable to find room.\\" Within a few years some of the novelty of the Choral Union had worn off. Less than capacity audiences were reported and the reviews in the press became more critical: a good sign that for the first time musical standards were being used to judge performances.  The 20th century  Derby Choral Union became an established society, with regular performances of the classical oratorios. It has an unbroken record, and shares with very few other major choirs the distinction of having continued to give at least two concerts every season, even throughout the Second World War (as documented in both the choir's repertoire listings and on page 7 of ). In 1942–43 this rose to five performances, and altogether seventeen concerts were staged during the period of the war. The future of Derby Choral Union was cemented from 1960 to the present day by aiming to achieve high standards of choral singing; thus the quality of its Musical Directors appointed over this period was crucial. Two notable celebrations occurred during this time: the choir's centenary in 1965–66, when Bach's Mass in B Minor, Elgar's Dream of Gerontius and Vaughan Williams' A Sea Symphony were performed during this auspicious season. Then in 1990–91, the 125th season, the following works were performed: Verdi's Requiem, Handel's Messiah and Elgar's Dream of Gerontius. In both seasons, the performances were conducted by Raymond Thorpe, the longest-serving musical director of the Derby Choral Union. He served from 1963 till his death in 1991. Notable concerts and appearances with the Derby Choral Union during the 20th century include: *Vaughan Williams conducting his Sea Symphony on 7 April 1926. *Isobel Baillie singing in Mendelssohn's Elijah on 3 December 1930. *Derby Choral Union making its first broadcast on the \\"wireless\\" in 1936. *In 1936, a joint concert with the Birmingham Festival Choral Society in the Birmingham Town Hall, singing Elgar's Dream of Gerontius. *Isobel Baillie and Peter Pears singing in Haydn's Creation on 18 November 1944. *Kathleen Ferrier singing in Bach's St. Matthew Passion in 1947. *Sir Adrian Boult conducting a performance of Elgar's Dream of Gerontius in Southwell Minster in 1966.  The choir today  The \\"home\\" of the Derby Choral Union is Derby Cathedral where three concerts are usually performed each season. The current Musical Director is Richard Dacey who is a graduate of the Royal School of Music, Fellow of the Royal College of Organists, Licentiate of the Royal Academy of Music and Associate of the Royal College of Music – as well as holding a Music Teachers' Certificate. The repertoire draws on traditional choral works by Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Bach and Dvořák as well as music by 20th-century and more contemporary composers such as Edward Elgar, William Walton, John Rutter, Karl Jenkins and Will Todd. A recent innovation was a \\"Jazz Choral Concert\\" in November 2011 at which Will Todd's Mass in Blue was performed at the Landau Forte College, Derby. The choir has enjoyed five successful overseas tours to Italy (2004 & 2005), Germany (2008), the Czech Republic (2011) and most recently to Hungary (2013) where DCU and friends gave two concerts in Budapest, performing two challenging pieces: Poulenc's Gloria and Duruflé's Requiem. One of the longest-serving members of the committee was Ken Spruce, who served as the Hon. Secretary of the choir from 1969 – 2000 and then as chairman from 2000–2009. In the early 1990s, he was appointed Chairman of the National Federation of Music Societies for the East Midlands region. In 2001 he was honoured with a Highly Commended Civic Award from the City of Derby for his outstanding work whilst he was secretary of the choir. One of the longest- serving members of the choir, Peter Haslam, died on 19 March 2012. He was a member of the bass section for over 50 years rarely missing a rehearsal or concert. He was chairman from 1962–1971 and was granted Life Membership in 1990. In 1965, he published a booklet called \\"Derby Choral Union – The First Hundred Years\\" which has been an invaluable source of archival information for this article. A succession of first-class Musical Directors, a dedicated committee, an enthusiastic membership, a commitment to performances of the highest quality, and the ability to adapt to social changes over almost 150 years has ensured the survival of Derby Choral Union and made it one of the leading choral societies in the East Midlands region.

They are named after Oscar Goldman. An overring (i.e., an intermediate ring lying between the ring and its field of fractions) of a Goldman domain is again a Goldman domain. There exists a Goldman domain where all nonzero prime ideals are maximal although there are infinitely many prime ideals.Kaplansky, p. 13 An ideal I in a commutative ring A is called a Goldman ideal if the quotient A/I is a Goldman domain. A Goldman ideal is thus prime, but not necessarily maximal. In fact, a commutative ring is a Jacobson ring if and only if every Goldman ideal in it is maximal. The notion of a Goldman ideal can be used to give a slightly sharpened characterization of a radical of an ideal: the radical of an ideal I is the intersection of all Goldman ideals containing I. Alternative definition An integral domain D is a G-domain if and only if: # Its quotient field is a simple extension of D # Its quotient field is a finite extension of D (Note this would mean the quotient field is integral over D and thus D has Krull dimension zero; i.e., a field.) # Intersection of its nonzero prime ideals (not to be confused with nilradical) is nonzero # There is a non-zero element u such that for any nonzero ideal I , u^n\\\\in I for some n .Kaplansky, Irving. Commutative Algebra. Polygonal Publishing House, 1974, pp. 12, 13. A G-ideal is defined as an ideal I\\\\subset R such that R/I is a G-domain. Since a factor ring is an integral domain if and only if the ring is factored by a prime ideal, every G-ideal is also a prime ideal. G-ideals can be used as a refined collection of prime ideals in the following sense: Radical can be characterized as the intersection of all prime ideals containing the ideal, and in fact we still get the radical even if we take the intersection over the G-ideals.Kaplansky, Irving. Commutative Algebra. Polygonal Publishing House, 1974, pp. 16, 17. Every maximal ideal is a G-ideal, since quotient by maximal ideal is a field, and a field is trivially a G-domain. Therefore, maximal ideals are G-ideals, and G-ideals are prime ideals. G-ideals are the only maximal ideals in Jacobson ring, and in fact this is an equivalent characterization of a Jacobson ring: a ring is a Jacobson ring when all G-ideals are maximal ideals. This leads to a simplified proof of the Nullstellensatz.Kaplansky, Irving. Commutative Algebra. Polygonal Publishing House, 1974, p. 19. It is known that given T\\\\supset R, a ring extension of a G-domain, T is algebraic over R if and only if every ring extension between T and R is a G-domain.Dobbs, David. \\"G-Domain Pairs\\".

This was the first film made by Avildsen after 1976's Rocky won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. It has never been released on video or DVD. Plot Lou Friedlander (Paul Sorvino) is a popular columnist for the New York Daily News, writing about the little people of bustling New York City while befriending a street boy named Marty (Adam Gifford). His life changes dramatically upon falling in love with neighbor Sarah Gantz (Anne Ditchburn), a young ballerina who had just discovered she is stricken with a debilitating condition that will eventually force her to quit dancing. Cast * Paul Sorvino as Lou Friedlander * Anne Ditchburn as Sarah Gantz * Nicolas Coster as David Fillmore * Anita Dangler as Franny * Thaao Penghlis as Christopher * Linda Selman as Barbara Bass * Hector Mercado as Roger Lucas * Dick Carballo as George Washington Monroe * Jack Ramage as Doctor Foster * Adam Gifford as Marty Olivera * Brenda Starr as Punk * Daniel Faraldo as T.C.

In casting the film, actor Dustin Hoffman was initially interested in portraying the Jimmy Breslin-esque Lou Friedlander, though he could not do so due to obligations of his First Artists company, and Paul Sorvino was cast in his place, marking his second collaboration with Avildsen after 1971's Cry Uncle. At the time working for the National Ballet of Canada, ballerina and choreographer Anne Ditchburn was cast after Avildsen screen tested over 400 dancers for the part of Sarah Gantz. The director then viewed and photograph of Ditchburn choreographing several dancers which, sensing her energy, caused his first hand witnessing of it during a tour of the foreign company at the Metropolitan Opera House. He then invited her to audition, which she later described as a \\"disaster\\", though she improved with lessons. Actor Hector Mercado was also a prominent dancer before filming, having appeared in many Broadway productions. The male dancer was initially auditioned due to his affiliation with another United Artists picture Hair, which was filming at the same time as Slow Dancing as well as a Broadway production of Box. He later went on to say of his juggling of performances that \\"luckily the shooting of Hair was all before and after Slow Dancing, and the producers of Box allowed me to fit both of them in my schedule.\\" In preparation for the film, Ditchburn appealed to a hairdresser to \\"do something with my hair\\". The various headbands and scarves the actress wears on her head through most of the film was used in order to hide the terrible results. She later commented that the move was a \\"big advantage\\" and that it \\"absorbs the perspiration\\". The film was shot over a course of eight weeks on location in New York City alongside the movies The Wiz, Matilda, Eyes of Laura Mars, and Hair, as well as the television productions of The Dain Curse, To Kill a Cop, Daddy I Don't Like It That Way, and Monkey's Uncle.\\" The film's many dance sequences were primarily set up by choreographer Robert North, though Ditchburn choreographed her own routine for a sequence in which she danced on a rooftop. Following poor reviews the film was reedited and an additional ten minutes of cut footage was restored in order to further develop Sorvino's character. The actor would later go on to say that he believed \\"the film is much improved\\" due to the additional scenes. In its foreign release, the film was retitled as A Woman's Quest (Denmark), A Big City With Heart (Finland), Small Steps to Big City (Greece), Married in New York (Portugal), and With You in a Big City (Austria and Germany). Release The film was released to theatres November 8, 1978, to an opening weekend gross of $11,355. It was then followed by a wide release on February 16, 1979. Norman Dresser of the Toledo Blade commented that the film \\"moved at the box office about as slowly as molasses pours out of a jar after a week in the refrigerator\\", noting its nine-week take of $335,436 was \\"dismal\\". The movie was unsuccessful, earning $1,576,500 at the end of its theatrical run against a budget of $7,000,000. Reaction The film opened to mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of the New York Times pointed out its similarities to Avildsen's previous film Rocky, going so far as to call it \\"Rocky on the Hoof\\". She went on to write a more critical review, praising Sorvino as a \\"perfectly plausible\\" newsman and Ditchburn as \\"so glamorous and mystifyingly odd that she recalls the young Audrey Hepburn\\" while stating that both were \\"sabotaged by the script\\". Ed Blank of The Pittsburgh Press wrote similar commenting that \\"Grant's script has little to do with real life and more to do with outdated movies\\", and noting that \\"Ditchburn looks and speak like Vivien Leigh\\". However, film critic Roger Ebert stated in his review that he \\"loved it\\" and that \\"Slow Dancing in the Big City cheerfully exists in the world of big hearts and brave tears and happy endings that make you blow your nose.\\", although he did admit that \\"There hasn't been a cornier romantic tear-jerker since Love Story and commented that Ditchburn's performance was \\"remarkably wooden\\". He and Gene Siskel later reviewed the film in an episode of their TV series Sneak Preview. In a particularly scathing review, Dan Dinicola of The Gazette commented that \\"it seems the makers of this tinsel romance were so concerned with following patented formulas that they forgot to give it a heart\\", adding that Grant's screenplay was \\"horrible; not so much the story idea, but the dialogue, the resolution, the subplots\\" and condemned Avildsen's direction as \\"soppy and as sloppy as the story\\". In response to the mixed reception, star Anne Ditchburn stated that she was \\"not surprised by the adverse reviews. Not many critics are romantically minded and I must say that I am not romantic in judging my peers in the dance world. There is a razor- fine edge between romanticism and corn, and I think Slow Dancing worked against the corn.\\" Ditchburn was nominated for a Golden Globe award for \\"Best Female Newcomer\\" for her performance,. On her performance Charles Champlin of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune stated \\"[Ditchburn] is not a professional actress, which may have been the luckiest thing in the world for her, because her performance has a kind of no-nonsense honesty that becomes a characterization. She is not an actress acting, but not an amateur trying to act either.\\" Merchandise Soundtrack The soundtrack by Bill Conti was released on vinyl in 1978. It was re-released by Varèse Sarabande on August 31, 2005, in a limited edition CD it shared with the Conti score for F.I.S.T. Additionally the song \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\", written and sung by Carole King, was used in the film though did not appear on the soundtrack. American figure skater Karen Chen also used \\"The Ovation\\" as her music for her 2017-18 and 2019-20 season free program. Novel A novelization of the film was released in the US by Warner Books and in the UK by Coronet Books, written by scriptwriter Barra Grant. Home Video The film has not been officially released on home video in any format since the end of its theatrical run. According to Avildsen this is due to licensing issues with the music. Legacy Slow Dancing in the Big City featured Anne Ditchburn's first foray into film, leading her to leave the National Ballet of Canada in pursuit of a film career, in addition to a generally low morale. The film's release also marked a bloom in Sorvino's film career, as it was coupled with his appearances in The Brinks Job and Bloodbrothers that same year. He considered Slow Dancing to be his \\"best shot\\" of the three after a string a negative reviews. In addition, this was one of the first appearances of Golden Globe nominated actress Danielle Brisebois. The film also featured the debut of director and scriptwriter Barra Grant. This was the first is a stream of financially unsuccessful films for John Avildsen following the massive success of Rocky, followed by The Formula, Neighbors, and 'A Night in Heaven, though the director himself does not list it among those films as his failures. Bill Conti's track \\"The Ovation\\" on the film's soundtrack is frequently used by Conti during his composition of the music for the Academy Awards, used to back the footage that honors actors and actresses who had died during the year prior.

It is a red brick building. The library itself, established near the end of the 19th century, is the oldest chartered public library in Rockland County. Shortly after its creation, it moved into the building, combining two contemporary revival architectural styles, after money was raised by the local chapter of the King's Daughters, a women's civic organization. A similar wing was built in 1983, and in 1991 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At the end of the 20th century the library moved into a new main building. The old building's interior was restored in the mid-2000s and continues to serve as a branch. Building The library is located on a small lot at the corner, across from the post office. A granite retaining wall, original to the site and thus considered a contributing resource to the Register listing, runs along the south side. The lot slopes gently toward the Hudson River a short distance to the east. The surrounding buildings are mostly residential. Exterior Its main section is a two-story, rectangular structure with a rounded southeast corner, exposed basement and flat roof. The brick is set off by a variety of stone trim: a bluestone water table, sandstone quoins and window trim, and limestone brackets on the overhanging eaves at the roofline. The roof is surfaced in asphalt and pierced by a brick chimney with corbeled cap at the center of the west face. Below the cornice is a limestone frieze decorated with carvings of garlands tied together in ropes and the letters \\"FOWLER LIBRARY BUILDING\\" on the south face. The fenestration includes large arched windows at both reading rooms, the adult room on the east side first story and the children's on the south side of the second story. Another arched window tops the arched main entrance on the corner. All have sandstone voussoirs. The mullions of the reading room windows are Ionic pilasters. The north facade has similarly asymmetrical fenestration, with a projecting bay. On the west is a sympathetic wing built in 1983 in conformance with National Park Service standards. It is also brick with a flat asphalt roof, and has a simple limestone cornice. Two wrought iron gates protect the main entrance. Behind them four bluestone steps, matching those at the street corner, lead up to the vestibule and its tiled floor. The sidelighted oak doors lead into an interior vestibule with similar paneling. A bronze dedication plaque commemorates the library's opening on May 14, 1903, and lists the names of its principal donor and the society's board of directors at that time. Interior The interior layout of both stories remains unchanged, as do many of the finishes. Both the adult rooms downstairs and the children's rooms upstairs have fireplaces with galzed brick, marbleized tile floors, carved mantels and beveled mirrors. The central stair has oak wainscoting, ash banisters, and newel posts topped with carved urns. The flooring, moldings and plaster walls are all original, as are the bookshelves and most other furniture. On the west wall, the original brick and stone window trim is still visible from the new wing side. The original plaster remains on the other side. In the basement, the brick flooring set in dirt is believed to be that of a hotel building on the site before the library was constructed. History Haverstraw was incorporated in 1854, and quickly grew due to a successful brick industry that tapped the large clay deposits along the river. In 1891 a group of wives of some of the community's wealthier businessmen organized the Haverstraw Ladies' Home Mission Circle. Originally a sewing circle meant to help the village's less fortunate, it soon saw a need for a wider scope. In 1894 a plan for a larger organization was drawn up, and the next year it formally incorporated as the King's Daughters Society. That year the president of the society suggested the organization set up a public library, a common charitable goal during the Gay Nineties. The members agreed, and petitioned the New York State Board of Regents for a charter. The request was approved, and Melvil Dewey, then director of the New York State Library, signed the charter, making the new library the oldest chartered public library in Rockland County. In 1896, the library opened in Jenkins Hall, to the west of the current building. Two years later, it moved to the National Bank Building at Main and Second streets. Soon the library became popular enough that it was apparent a building of its own was necessary. In 1899, local brickmaker Denton Fowler offered to donate $10,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) toward the purchase of land and the construction of a building to be named after him, as long as it was matched. Nothing happened for three years, as the society was unable to raise additional money. They decided on a smaller building, and two of the members were able to raise the money necessary. Construction began in October 1902, and the library opened seven months later. William H. Parkton, a local architect who had designed many buildings in downtown Haverstraw, was chosen to design the library. He mixed Classical Revival elements like the wide frieze, quoins and pilasters with Renaissance Revival features like the round-arched windows, detailed cornice and rusticated stonework. In 1956 a fire badly damaged the upper floor. The building was repaired, but its entire collection was lost. The area grew, and in 1978 the Thiells branch was opened in a storefront on US 202 further inland to serve patrons in the other areas of the Town of Haverstraw. That same year the state granted the library a new charter as a special library district, giving residents the right to vote on budgets and elect trustees to the board. The Thiells branch soon moved to the basement of Town Hall. In 1983, a combination of state and federal funding helped the library expand the Fowler Building with the west wing. Named after Kay Freeman, the director of the library for 21 years, a condition of the federal contribution was that the wing be architecturally sympathetic with the existing building. The original building's exerior was also restored during construction, and a wheelchair ramp added. Three years later, the library began looking for land for new facilities, a process that would take it most of the next decade. During the time, the original building was listed on the Register and, in 1993, received an award from the county historical society for continuing use. In 2001 the Town Board approved a subdivision on Rosman Road that would allow the library to build a new main branch at Garnerville. Ground was broken later that year and it opened in 2003. Three years later, the library board closed the Fowler building to restore its interior. It reopened in 2007.

It was commissioned on 12 December 1944, Lt. Dennis D. O'Callaghan, USNR, in command. Service History (Turner) During World War II the ship was assigned to the Asia-Pacific theater. At that time the fleet was under the command of Admiral Spruance and named the Fifth fleet. Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner was Commander of Amphibious Forces Pacific and was to be in charge of operations until the beachhead was established. The Kerama Retto islands were a small chain of islands 15 miles west of the southwest tip of Okinawa. The invasion of the Kerma Retto was an opportunity to break in all twelve of the 188-class LSM(R)s. One of the reasons that Admiral Turner wanted to capture Kerama Retto was his knowledge that the Japanese Sea Raiding Units had suicide boats hidden there. On the morning of 29 March three of these boats attacked the but were promptly destroyed. The northern half of the six- mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 53, under the command of Rear Admiral Lawrence F. Reifsnider. Embarked were the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions under Major General Roy S. Geiger. The northern support craft included , , USS LSM(R)-196, , , and . On 3 May 1945 the 188-class LSM(R)s were put to the test and were not found wanting. The action at the picket stations proved that the courage and punishment endured by US Navy personnel was unrelated to the size of the ship. The Japanese launched their fifth kikusui attack on 3 May. Picket station 10 was the hardest hit. Shortly before dusk, the destroyer was hit by a series of six kamikazes, suffering 45 killed or missing and 49 wounded. The ship survived, but was later decommissioned because it wasn't worth repairing. About the same time, approximately 20 planes attacked destroyer . She was crashed by four of them and sank within 12 minutes of the first hit. She lost 30 dead or missing and 79 wounded. LSM(R)-195 was also on Picket Station 10 and while rushing to the aid of Aaron Ward and the Little was likewise crashed by a kamikaze. The crash started her rockets exploding and knocked out the fire main and auxiliary pumps. LSM(R)-195 had to be abandoned and, after being ripped by heavy explosions, sank. The following day the ordeal for the LSM(R)s reached its tragic climax. The day dawned bright and ominous. was patrolling at Picket Station 12. Not long after sunrise the anticipated kamikazes arrived and were met by American combat air patrol. Several of the Japanese planes managed to get through and attack the ships on this station. Three kamikazes crashed LSM(R)-190. The ship that had seen so much previous action and had been credited with rescuing 180 survivors of other stricken ships was herself sunk. In the same attack the destroyer USS Luce was sunk, carrying 126 of her 312 officers and men with her. At the same time as LSM(R)-190 was fighting her final battle, LSM(R)-194 was facing the same fate at Picket Station 1. GM1c Joseph A. Staum crewman of the LSM(R)-196 was killed off Okinawa on 1 April 1945. Okinawa Radar Picket Line(C.T.G. 52.21) The American plan for defense against the kamikazes was to have fighters intercept the Japanese as early as possible. Sixteen radar picket stations were established around the island, in some cases almost 100 miles out, to give early warning of the Japanese planes which might be coming from any direction. Each station was manned around the clock by a handful of ships ranging from destroyers down to minesweepers. Their job was to sound the alarm and vector fighters to intercept before the Japanese could attack the fleet anchored off Okinawa and the Allied forces and supply dumps ashore. Unfortunately, some of the eager-to-die Japanese wanted to attack the first American ships they saw: the pickets. Dennis L. Francis LSM Commander, Flotilla Nine for the period 2 – 20 April, Action Report indicated that these ships are not particularly suited for picket duty. Since their primary function is to deliver rockets during invasion operations, it seems feasible that subjecting them to continual enemy air attack will allow this secondary duty to seriously affect their ability to perform their primary function due to damage. They have no great value in combating enemy air craft due to the absence of air search radar, adequate director control for the 5\\"/38 main battery, and director control for the 40mm single guns. The fact that they carry a considerable quantity of explosive rockets in their magazines presents another hazard. In general, it is believed that assigning them to picket duty should be avoided since it means risking the operation of a limited number of specialized ships which could be performed by any number of other landing craft whose primary function is more closely coincident with screening operations. Before these recommendations were implemented LSMR-195 was sunk on 3 May 1945 with 9 killed and 16 wounded, LSMR-190 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 18 wounded, LSMR-194 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 23 wounded.

It was first published (in English) in the Netherlands by De Bezige Bij on September 1, 2009, in Canada by Knopf Canada on October 20, 2009, and in the United States by Random House on October 27, 2009. The novel spans five decades and is about a boy and his father who flee the logging community of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire after a tragic accident. While on the run, the boy grows up to become a famous writer, writing eight semi-autobiographical novels. The book was included in Time's 2009 list of \\"the fall's most anticipated movies, books, TV shows, albums and exhibits\\". Last Night in Twisted River took 20 years to conceive and write, and is a story within a story that shows the development of a novelist and the writing process. It uses many of the themes and plot devices that have already seen treatment in other works by the author. The career of the novelist in the book closely tracks the career of Irving himself, making it Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel. The book received mixed reviews in the press. The Independent called it Irving's most powerful work to date, while The Dallas Morning News admired Irving's modern version of the traditional flight and revenge theme. The New York Times was not as impressed and felt that with better editing it could have equaled some of Irving's more powerful works. The St. Petersburg Times described the novel as a \\"loose and baggy tale in search of a center\\". Plot The novel opens in 1954 in the small logging settlement of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire. A log driving accident on the river has just claimed the life of a young logger, Angel, who slipped and fell under the logs. Dominic Baciagalupo is the camp's Italian-American cook who lives above the kitchen with his 12-year-old son, Daniel. Dominic lost his wife, Rosie, 10 years previously when a drunk Dominic, Rosie and a logger and mutual friend, Ketchum, were dancing on the frozen river, and the ice broke and Rosie went under. Later another accident happens that changes the lives of Dominic, Daniel and Ketchum. \\"Injun Jane\\", the kitchen's dishwasher and girlfriend of the local law officer, Constable Carl, is having an affair with Dominic. One night, mistaking her for a bear attacking his father, Daniel kills her with an eight-inch cast-iron skillet. Dominic takes Jane's body and deposits it on the kitchen floor of Carl's house, knowing that Carl will be passed out drunk and will probably believe he killed her, as he often beat her up. Early the next morning Dominic and Daniel tell Ketchum what happened and flee Twisted River in case the bad-tempered Carl finds out what really happened. Dominic and Daniel head for a restaurant in the Italian North End of Boston to tell Angel's mother of her son's death. Dominic gets a job as a cook in the restaurant and changes his surname to Del Popolo (Angel's mother's surname) to hide from Carl. During this time Daniel attends Exeter, a private school in southern New Hampshire, followed by the University of New Hampshire. While at university Daniel starts writing his first novel. He also meets Katie Callahan, a radical art student, whom he agrees to marry. Katie has one mission in life: to make potential Vietnam War draftees fathers, thus enabling them to apply for paternity deferment. Daniel and Katie have a son Joe, but when Joe is 2, Katie leaves Daniel to find another young man to rescue from the war. Daniel moves to Iowa with Joe, where he enrolls in the Iowa Writers' Workshop. He also changes his name to Danny Angel to hide from Carl, and uses this nom de plume to publish his novels. After graduating from the Writers' Workshop in 1967, Danny and Joe move to Putney, Vermont. Ketchum keeps in touch with both Dominic and Danny via telephone and letters, and warns them that Carl is looking for them. On Ketchum's advice, Dominic leaves Boston to join Danny in Vermont. He changes his name to Tony Angel, father of the writer Danny Angel. While Danny teaches writing at Windham College, Tony opens and runs his own restaurant. After the publication of his fourth and most successful novel, Kennedy Fathers (based on Katie), Danny stops teaching and focuses on writing. Then in 1983, two of the sawmill's wives in Twisted River are passing through Vermont and stop for a meal at Tony's restaurant. They recognize Tony and later tell Carl where \\"Cookie\\" is. Again, on Ketchum's advice, the father and son are forced to flee, this time to Toronto, Ontario. With their cover blown, Tony and Danny revert to their original names. Dominic finds another restaurant to work in, while Danny continues writing, still under his pseudonym. Joe remains in the United States while at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Danny meets a Canadian screenwriter named Charlotte Turner, who is writing the screenplay of Danny's abortion novel East of Bangor. They decide to marry, but only after Joe graduates. When Joe dies in a car accident in 1987, Danny decides he cannot face the possibility of ever losing another child, and he and Charlotte part ways. He retains the right to a lonely cabin on an island in Georgian Bay at Pointe au Baril, owned by Charlotte, which he uses for his writing. In 2001, Ketchum gets careless and unwittingly leads Carl to Dominic and Danny's house in Toronto. Carl shoots and kills Dominic and Danny retaliates by shooting and killing Carl. Ketchum is devastated at having failed to protect his friends and takes his own life at Twisted River. Danny, who has now lost his mother, father, son and their friend, tries to focus on writing his next book, a follow-up to his previous eight semi-autobiographical novels. Then his last hope, Amy (\\"Lady Sky\\"), arrives on his doorstep. When Joe was 2, Amy had parachuted naked onto a pig farm Danny and Joe were visiting. Danny rescued Amy from the pig pen and Joe, awe-struck by this event, called her \\"Lady Sky\\". Amy in turn offered to help Danny whenever he needed it. Having read all about the famous writer and his misfortunes, Amy tracks Danny down and moves in with him. Happy now, Danny finds the opening sentence of his new book: \\"The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long.\\" Main characters *Dominic Baciagalupo (\\"Cookie\\") / Dominic Del Popolo / Tony Angel – An Italian-American logging company cook in Twisted River in northern New Hampshire. His father, who had absconded before he was born, had the name \\"Capodilupo\\" (\\"Head of the Wolf\\"), but his mother named him \\"Baciacalupo\\" (\\"Kiss of the Wolf\\"), which later became \\"Baciagalupo\\" due to a clerical error. He damaged his ankle in a logging accident at the age of 12, giving him a permanent limp, after which his mother taught him how to cook to keep him away from the logs. He changes his name to \\"Del Popolo\\" in Boston, and to \\"Tony Angel\\" (father of the famous writer) in Vermont, to escape the attentions of Constable Carl from whom he and his son are fleeing.

Background Although this was his 12th published novel, Irving said that Last Night in Twisted River was \\"20 years in the making\\". The idea for a novel about a cook and his son on the run had been in the back of his mind for as long ago as 1986. Irving, who likes to start his novels with the last sentence, said in an interview with The Independent in October 2009: \\"For the longest time the last sentence eluded me, but 20 years ago I imagined a novel about a cook and his young son who become fugitives; who have to run from some violent act that will follow them. And it was always in a kind of frontier town — a place where there was one law, and it was one man, who was single-minded and bad.\\" Irving did not start writing the novel until 2005. Speaking to the BBC World Service in October 2009, Irving explained that he found that last sentence on his way to a doctor's appointment. He said an old Bob Dylan CD was playing \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" in his car, and when he heard the lyrics: :I had a job in the great north woods :Working as a cook for a spell :But I never did like it all that much :And one day the ax just fell the last sentence suddenly came to him. That was in January 2005, and by August 2005 he had worked his way back to the first sentence and was able to start writing the novel. John Irving in March 2010. The career of the character Daniel Baciagalupo/Danny Angel in the novel bears numerous similarities to that of John Irving. In an October 2009 interview with the New York magazine, Irving stated: \\"I tried to have fun with the self-referential stuff. I felt the need to be a little playful, because there were autobiographical parts of the last novel that were difficult for me.\\" In his last novel, Until I Find You (2005) Irving had alluded to his sexual initiation when he was 11, by a woman in her 20s. Irving is well known to have been influenced by Victorian authors such as Dickens and Hardy, and American novelists of the same period, including Melville. For Last Night in Twisted River, Irving acknowledges two other sources: The Theban Plays of Sophocles, and the Western movie genre. To make the novel as authentic as possible, Irving used a cousin in the logging business to help locate \\"an old- time log-driver alive, alert and literate enough in English to read [his] manuscript\\" (many loggers in New Hampshire were French-speaking Québécois). Irving also researched the restaurant business and its menus and ingredients, calling on the help of friends in the industry. The Toronto restaurant where part of the novel is set, whose address is given as 1158 Yonge Street, was based on the real-life restaurant at that address, Pastis Express. Last Night in Twisted River was included in Time magazine's 2009 list of \\"the fall's most anticipated movies, books, TV shows, albums and exhibits\\". Analysis Last Night in Twisted River is John Irving's 12th novel and his \\"most ambitious\\", spanning five decades from 1954 to 2005 and taking place mostly in the northeastern United States and southern Ontario in Canada. It is about the relationship between three men: Dominic Baciagalupo, an Italian-American cook with \\"the look of a man long resigned to his fate\\", his son Daniel (Danny), who grows up to be a famous novelist, and Ketchum, a \\"foul-mouthed logger with a heart of gold\\". The novel is built around its characters and their idiosyncrasies. The father-son relationship between Dominic and Danny is \\"the heart of the book\\", and is a departure from Irving's previous novels which generally feature mother-son relationships in the absence of a father. Last Night in Twisted River is a story within a story that shows, through Danny Angel, the development of a novelist and the writing process. Irving modelled Danny's career loosely on his own: both are the same age; both get a scholarship to Phillips Exeter Academy; both are taught by Kurt Vonnegut at the University of Iowa and go on to become famous novelists; both are \\"Kennedy fathers\\" enabling them to claim paternity deferment during the Vietnam war; both have their first success with their fourth novel (Kennedy Fathers and The World According to Garp). Danny and Irving's sixth books, East of Bangor and The Cider House Rules are both abortion novels set in a Maine orphanage which both later win an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Danny and Irving's fiction are \\"both autobiographical and not autobiographical at the same time\\", but Last Night in Twisted River is Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel. Irving has explored what motivates novelists to write in many of his previous novels, but here, \\"[a]s he moves into what might be termed his late period\\", Irving examines these issues far more closely, and bares his soul more than ever before. Rene Rodriguez wrote in the Los Angeles Times that this is Irving's \\"most personal and revealing exploration of the writing process\\". In The Times Helen Rumbelow said Irving \\"almost rivals Paul Auster for the mischievous way he inserts a thinly fictionalized version of himself into the tale\\". Many themes present in Irving's earlier works are recycled in this book: the story begins in New England, it features a fractured family, a main character is a writer, sudden tragedy, a young boy is sexually initiated by an older women, and bears. It contains Irving's usual fare of \\"melancholic humor and comic absurdity\\", \\"grotesque deaths and grisly accidents\\", plus \\"lots and lots of coincidences\\". As in Irving's writings, Danny's novels are full of \\"fairy-tale exaggerations\\" and \\"melodramatic worst-case scenarios\\". Daniel Mallory in the Los Angeles Times said that while Irving \\"loots his own canon\\", so do other writers, for example Philip Roth, Richard Ford and Don DeLillo. Lucy Daniel wrote in The Daily Telegraph that while such \\"predictable eccentricities\\" might disadvantage a writer, they are \\"part of the charm\\" of Irving's works. As in The Hotel New Hampshire, incestuous relationships take place in this book: here Danny has sex with some of his cousins and an aunt. But while Irving presents it in a naughty-but-nice manner, it has serious undertones: it was revealed after Irving's 11th novel, Until I Find You (2005), that he was sexually abused as a child. English author Giles Foden in The Guardian called Last Night in Twisted River \\"a very playful novel\\": it toyed with character and the \\"fluidity of identity\\", suggesting that someone may \\"perform [their] identity rather than be defined by it\\". Foden said that the whole novel could be seen as a performance of Irving's own literary identity. More of Irving's \\"playfulness\\" manifests itself at the end of the book when the first sentence of Danny's new book is the same as the first sentence of Last Night in Twisted River—Danny is writing the very book we have been reading. And the book cover of a wind-bent pine tree (photographed by Irving's son, Everett) is the same tree Danny and Irving see from the window of their writing shacks in Pointe au Baril Station in Ontario. The narrative moves back and forth in time, with each new section leaping forward 10 to 30 years, and then backtracking, in \\"fits and starts\\" to fill in the missing details. Michael Berry said in the San Francisco Chronicle that this \\"hopscotching strategy allows for multiple layers of suspense and irony\\". Rodriguez said these \\"sudden shifts in points of view that give new meaning to the passage you have just read and leaps in chronology that keep crucial incidents offstage\\" makes it an \\"agile, sometimes tricky novel\\", and the closest Irving has come to writing metafiction. Reception Last Night in Twisted River received mixed reviews from a number of critics. Simmy Richman wrote in The Independent that it is \\"the most poetic and powerful of Irving's work to date\\", and called Irving \\"the only modern American writer able to seamlessly merge the small detail with the significant event, while writing books that balance literary authority with mass-market appeal\\". Lucy Daniel in The Daily Telegraph called the book \\"Moralistic, perverse, funny and uplifting\\", but added that it was debatable if it was \\"clever metafiction\\", or a \\"thinly disguised memoir\\". Colette Bancroft in the St. Petersburg Times described the novel as a \\"loose and baggy tale in search of a center\\". Several reviewers of the book were impressed by Irving's characters. English author Giles Foden wrote in The Guardian that Ketchum is \\"[a] magnificent creation, he's like something out of The Last of the Mohicans\\", while Ron Charles said in The Washington Post that he is \\"one of Irving's most endearing and memorable characters\\", a cross between Shakespeare's Falstaff and Louise Erdrich's Nanapush. Literary critic Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times described Constable Carl, the policeman who pursues Dominic and Danny, as not unlike Victor Hugo’s obsessive Inspector Javert in Les Misérables. Foden said Irving's manipulation of the character's identities was \\"nothing less than show-stopping\\". Bancroft felt that the central character of Danny is not as interesting as those that surround him. He is often a passive observer rather than a participant; many of the important events happen \\"offstage\\", only to be recalled later by Danny, resulting in a \\"leaching of emotion and immediacy\\". Bancroft complained that \\"digressions multiply and go nowhere\\", and that even the restaurant menus, though interesting, are historically dubious\\". Kakutani was also critical of the novel, saying that with some \\"diligent editing\\" it could have equaled some of Irving's more powerful works, in particular The World According to Garp (1978) and A Widow for One Year (1998). She said while it was at times a \\"deeply felt and often moving story\\", it was tarnished by a \\"gimmicky plot; cartoony characters; absurd contrivances; cheesy sentimentality; and a thoroughly preposterous ending\\". She complained about the same \\"odd little leitmotifs\\" that appear in many of Irving's works, and the inflated plot with its \\"gothic tinsel\\" and \\"pointless digressions\\". She called it an \\"entertaining\\" but \\"messy and long-winded, commentary on the fiction-making process itself\\". English novelist and critic Stephanie Merritt wrote in The Observer that once Carl finds Dominic and Danny, the novel \\"loses momentum and becomes more didactic\\", and that the \\"sheer exuberance of detail ... at times threatens to overwhelm the story\\". But overall she was impressed with the book, saying that it is \\"a big, old-fashioned novel in the best sense\\". Joanna Scott wrote in The New York Times that she liked the sensory sensations Irving evoked in the book, in particular those brought on by Dominic's cooking. She also found some of the book's comical scenes, including the naked female skydiver landing in a pigpen, \\"among the most memorable that Irving has written\\". Writer and critic Alan Cheuse in The Dallas Morning News enjoyed the book. He found the flight of the father and son a \\"brilliant plot device\\", and was fascinated by the details of the restaurant business and the process of writing novels. \\"As a writer, I had nothing but admiration for Irving's modern version of the old flight and revenge motif.\\" Michael Berry in the San Francisco Chronicle called it Irving's \\"most controlled novel since A Widow for One Year\\". Despite covering five decades and numerous settings, it still \\"cohere[s] into a satisfying tale of loss and redemption\\". He said \\"It's an impressive feat of sustained narrative craftsmanship\\". Robert Wiersema wrote in the National Post that this is one of Irving's \\"most rewarding and satisfying novels\\". He said he performs \\"the most death-defying of literary feats: negotiat[ing] the delicate line between familiarity and novelty in such impressive style as to create a work that is at once comfortable, vintage Irving yet wholly new and unique\\". Ron Charles in The Washington Post praised the opening section of the book and its \\"vibrant\\" Twisted River community, but was critical of the rest of the novel saying it is \\"scrambled across many blurry cities and restaurants and different times in a way that deadens the novel's momentum\\". He said that as soon as Dominic and his son flee Twisted River, the story \\"disintegrates in what must be the most disappointing wipeout of Irving's career\\". Charles was particularly critical of the fact that the book dwelt excessively on Danny's writing career, which mirrored Irving's, saying that it was \\"shorthand for real storytelling, for creating colorful places full of well-developed characters\\". William Kowalski in The Globe and Mail questioned why the book was not released as a memoir as there are times when Irving appears to have modeled Danny \\"literally after himself\\". He complained that it was these passages that tended to \\"bog down\\" the story. Kowalski called the novel \\"a flawed but mature work by one of our most accomplished writers\\". For Rene Rodriguez in the Los Angeles Times, the highlight of the book was the attention it gave to the bond between Dominic and his son, but she did feel that the details of the creative process should have been relegated to an essay.

It was located in what is now the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. Fort Gaston as part of the Humboldt Military District was intended to control the Hupa Indians and to protect them from hostile white settlers. The post was named for 2nd Lieutenant William Gaston, of the First Dragoons, who had been killed May 17, 1858, during the Spokane–Coeur d'Alene–Paloos War.Located in the Hoopa Valley. Historic California Posts: Fort Gaston (Camp Gaston) (Humboldt County) Fort Gaston, from 1866 to 1867 officially designated as Camp Gaston, is not to be confused with Camp Gaston, on the Colorado River (sometimes erroneously called Fort Gaston). That Camp Gaston was also named after 2nd Lt. William Gaston and was founded as an advance base in April 1859 near Palo Verde, California, during the Mohave War.  History  In 1858, a Yurok agent overheard some men in a saloon talking about a large group of armed men that were moving downriver from Weaverville, California towards the Hupa lands to exterminate them. He was able to turn them back that time but the Hupa worried about their safety and began gathering their own weapons while petitioning for a fort as well.Lewis, David Rich, Neither wolf nor dog: American Indians, environment, and agrarian change, Oxford University Press, New York, 1994, pg. 86-87 Founded in December 1859, and first manned by Captain Edmund Underwood and 56 men from a company of the 4th US Infantry Regiment, Fort Gaston from the beginning was to keep an eye on the Hupa who were suspected of aiding surrounding tribes in attacks on white settlers, ambushes of mail carriers and of stages in what was called the Bald Hills War. The Hupa denied aiding their neighbors but resisted providing guides to the army until 1862. However they never seemed to catch the enemy, and were in fact secretly warning them. In 1861, the district commander proposed to his superiors a gathering of all the local Indians at Fort Gaston to stage a demonstration of drilling and firepower that would convince them to end hostilities. The idea failed when he said he required six companies of infantry for the demonstration. At the time regular troops were being pulled from the forts in California to participate in the Civil War. Colonel Herbert M. Hart, USMC (retired), Historic California Posts: Fort Gaston(Camp Gaston) (Humboldt County) from Pioneer Forts of the Far West, published in 1965, The California State Military Museum Fort Gaston's commander protested the transfer of any more men because it might have dire consequences. he claimed the local settlers would abandon the valley despite building a blockhouse, if any more troops were withdrawn. In the place of the withdrawn regulars, Company D, 3rd Regiment California Volunteer Infantry was sent to Fort Gaston October, 1861, operating against Indians until ordered to San Francisco August 23, 1862. They were involved in a skirmish at Light Prairie, near Arcata, August 21, 1862. The Civil War Archive: Union Regimental Histories, California, 3rd Infantry Regiment Company K, 2nd Regiment California Volunteer Infantry was ordered to Fort Gaston December 1861, and served there until June 1863. Company K was in action, at Weaversville Crossing, on the Mad River, July 2, 1862 and near Oak Camp April 30, 1863. Company H, 2nd Regiment California Volunteer Infantry moved to Fort Gaston April 20, 1862 but returned to Fort Humboldt July 1862. Company F, 2nd Regiment California Volunteer Infantry was ordered to garrison Fort Gaston from September to November 1862. They were involved in a skirmish at Redwood September 8, 1862. Company I, 2nd Regiment California Volunteer Infantry from April 20, 1862, joined the Fort Gaston garrison, also serving there until June 1863. Company I was in action, at the skirmish at Fort Gaston August 6, 1862 and the affair at Little River August 23, 1862. The Civil War Archive: Union Regimental Histories, California, 2nd Infantry Regiment From June 1863, companies B and C of the 1st Battalion California Volunteer Mountaineers relieved 2nd Regiment as garrison of Fort Gaston. Company D later reinforced them. These units were involved in various skirmishes during 1863, at Oak Camp June 6, Thomas' Ranch November 12, Trinity River November 13 and Willow Creek November 17. On December 25, 1863, a battle with the Indians took place near Fort Gaston. The Indians holed up in several log buildings, firing at companies B and C of the mountaineers from rifle ports. Attempting to drive them out the army attacked them with howitzers. At nightfall, with the buildings in ruins, the Indians were able to escape in the darkness. The Civil War Archive: Union Regimental Histories, California, 1st Battalion Mountaineers The mountaineers continued operating against Indians in 1864, Company B in a skirmish near Boynton's Prairie May 6, 1864. Company C, at the Thomas House, on the Trinity River, May 27, 1864 and in operations in the Trinity Valley September 1-December 3, 1864. The mountaineer companies held the fort until June 1865.

It is an independent film and stars Willem Dafoe and musician Robert Gordon, who also did the music for the film. The film has been compared to The Wild One. Plot A motorcycle gang becomes involved in trouble in a small southern town. The group of bikers congregates in and around a roadside diner and gas station en route to Daytona. The owners of the diner and gas station are nervous and one of the customers, Tarver, seems to be violently resentful towards them. The bikers hang around the garage, tinkering with their bikes, playing chicken with switch-blades, drinking, dancing and so on. A young girl, named Telena (who is Tarver's daughter), arrives in a red open-topped sports car. Vance (the Dafoe character) talks to her and they go for a drive, buying beers and whiskey for the rest of the gang. Vance and Telena, go to a motel room where they have sex. As they are about to leave, they are disturbed by gun shots outside. It is Telena's father, Tarver, who has spotted her car and in a typical fit of anger decides to shoot out the car tyres in order to punish her. He breaks into the room and takes Telena with him. The bikers pursue Tarver and run him off the road, causing him to crash his car. Telena is injured in the accident. Later in the evening, the gang is in a local bar. One of the waitresses from the diner performs a striptease dance and the male customers of the bar become a little feverish. Tarver, who is also in the bar encourages one of the other locals to join him in attacking the bikers. One of the gang goes to the bathroom and Tarver attacks him. The struggle spills out into the bar where the violence escalates and gun shots ring out. Tarver is shot and as the confusion in the bar reigns, the assumption is that the bikers have shot him in revenge but it is Telena who has shot her father in response to his lifelong abuse of her and her mother. Further gun-shots are fired. Outside, Vance stands smoking and sees Telena, now sat back in her car who then proceeds to use the same pistol to shoot herself.

Description The white shell has a bulimiform or subglobose shape. It is polished, without epidermis or nacre, variegated with bright colors. The heavy operculum is calcareous, internally paucispiral, with a nucleus near the basal margin. It is externally convex. The columella is smooth, arcuate and not dentate. The animal has long tentacles, and has usually pectinated head lobes. These frontal lobes distinguish this genus from Tricolia, which lacks frontal lobes. The epipodial line contains generally cirrhi.The branchial plume is long. The narrow foot is long, pointed posteriorly, rounded before. Below it is divided longitudinally by a median groove. The rhomboidal jaws are covered with imbricating scales. The radula is rather short. The formula of teeth is typically ∞ 5.1.5 ∞, but sometimes lacks the median and outer lateral teeth.G.W.

Телеоператорный Режим Управления - Teleoperated Mode of (spacecraft) Control ) system is a manual docking system of Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft that serves as a backup to the automatic Kurs system. It was used on the former Mir space station and is currently in use on the International Space Station. The TORU system became known to the public in 1997 when it was used during the manual approach of Progress M-34 to Mir that ended up with a dangerous collision. It was an approach of a previously used Progress spacecraft with the purpose of research work on further improvement of TORU. TORU has two joysticks which can be used to manually fly the ship. The left joystick is used to control the movement of the ship (translation) and the right joystick is used to control its orientation (rotation). The system also includes a camera mounted on the docking spacecraft and provides visual feedback when the spacecraft is remotely controlled from the station to which it is docking. TORU also transfers sounds from the spacecraft that may provide indirect information about the docking process. While ships are sufficiently close when docking to make signal travel delay insignificant, cosmonauts claim that TORU has a certain delay when operating the ship from the space station remotely. Some radio amateurs think they have observed TORU docking signals. TORU was first tested in 1993 (Progress M-15) and actually used next year to dock Progress M-24 (after two unsuccessful attempts to dock automatically). Despite the 1997 year collision, it was used same year again to dock the next Progress spacecraft, Progress M-35, after Mir board computer failed. TORU was also used in many later missions (Progress M-53, Progress M-67, Progress M1-4 and possibly others).

Production The film was written by Jan Sharp who was then married to the director Phil Noyce.

The story was originally set in Bali, where the movie was to be shot, but before filming began the Sydney Morning Herald ran a series of articles suggesting the wife of the Indonesian president was corrupt. All Indonesian visas for Australians were cancelled and the script was rewritten to be set in Thailand, with several keys scenes shot in Sydney.David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p112-113 Phil Noyce later said the story was so distorted by this change they probably would have been better off not making the movie: > The original story was very different.

He has been criticized by many conservatives such as Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh. He received significant support in his 2008 presidential campaign, including endorsements from five Representatives of the U.S. House, three former governors and seven newspapers.Mike Huckabee greeting an attendee after an address at the San Francisco Commonwealth Club, Jan. 31, 2008. Ideology Fiscal In late 1996, Huckabee campaigned for ballot Amendment 1, a plan to adjust property tax rules to make school funding more equal across the state, and Amendment 2, a constitutional amendment increasing the state sales tax 0.125 percent to improve the state's park system and natural resources. Later in 2001, his refusal to raise taxes in the face of a budget shortfall sparked criticism from lawmakers and the media. In response to the criticism he created the \\"Tax Me More Fund\\", which was a voluntary fund for people who felt that the government needed to raise more taxes. State Sen. Minority Leader John Brown called the \\"Tax Me More Fund\\" a campaign tactic. The conservative non-profit group Club for Growth spent hundreds of thousands of dollars during 2008 presidential race attacking Huckabee's economic policies. The group argued that Huckabee increased state spending 65.3 percent (1996–2004) and supported five tax increases. In response, Huckabee said he doubled the standard deduction and the child care tax credit, eliminated the marriage penalty and the capital gains tax on the sale of a home, and reduced the capital gains tax for both businesses and individuals. Ernest Dumas of the Arkansas Times, a consistent Huckabee critic,Archive of Dumas' articles from Arkansas Times Arkansas Times responded that most of the tax cuts were small deductions and exemptions initiated by the state legislature, the broad-based tax cut was proposed by his predecessor and Huckabee was \\"the biggest taxer and spender in Arkansas history.\\" The Club for Growth pointed out that Huckabee publicly opposed the repeal of a sales tax on groceries and medicine in 2002, signed a bill raising taxes on gasoline in 1999, and signed a $5.25 bed-tax on private nursing home patients in 2001. Arkansas Health Care Association President Jim Cooper stated the private nursing home tax was necessary in order to avert future huge tax increases as a result of years of mismanagement. The libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute gave Huckabee an \\"F\\" for his spending/tax policies as governor in 2006 and a D for his career as governor. Former Arkansas State Representative Randy Minton (R) said Huckabee's \\"support for taxes split the Republican Party, and damaged our name brand.\\"Another Man From Hope Wall Street Journal October 26, 2007. Retrieved November 26, 2007 The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration reported that during Huckabee's tenure, taxes decreased ninety times for a reduction of $378 million, while taxes were raised twenty-one times for an increase of $883 million. In 2005, Time magazine named him one of the five best governors in the U.S., writing \\"Huckabee has approached his state's troubles with energy and innovation\\". The newspaper of Dallas Morning News endorsed Huckabee in 2008 and praised his fiscal policies as governor saying \\"Mr. Huckabee established a respectable record of fiscal responsibility in Arkansas. Rather than run up deficits, he backed raising taxes to pay for needed infrastructure, health care and education. That's called prudence, and it was once a Republican virtue.\\" Social The Christian Science Monitor called Huckabee a \\"conservative with a social gospel.\\" because he \\"speaks the language of Christian Evangelicals on social issues\\" but as governor opened himself up to criticism that he was not consistently conservative on taxing and spending on education and healthcare.http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1107/p01s04-uspo.html Bill O'Reilly's first question to Huckabee in an interview was \\"Is Mike Huckabee ‘Too Religious’ to be elected president?\\" Personality Huckabee's personality has been described in positive terms as \\"gentle and warm\\", \\"charming\\", \\"friendly, teddy-bear\\", and \\"engaging, warm, relaxed, and persuasive\\". Huckabee's personality has been described in negative terms as \\"petty, thin- skinned, self-righteous\\", and \\"somewhat vindictive\\". Mixed descriptions include \\"best of leaders and the worst of thin-skinned pols\\" and \\"charming and aloof\\". Perception from liberals and Democrats On December 9, 2007, liberal columnist Frank Rich of The New York Times praised Huckabee in an op- ed saying Huckabee is the Republicans' Obama. On December 11, 2007, the conservative news website Drudge Report, stated in an \\"exclusive\\" report that the highest levels of the Democratic Party told their officials to avoid any criticism of 2008 Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee, until he would secure the nomination. One Democrat said \\"He'll easily be their McGovern, an easy kill.\\" Support from minority groups On January 21, 2008, Mike Huckabee received the endorsement of 50 African-American leaders in Atlanta, Georgia. Huckabee Courts Black Vote (CBS News, January 21, 2008) The endorsers cited Huckabee's record on life, education, minorities, the economy, the prison system, and immigration as Arkansas governor. Criticism from gay rights groups Huckabee has expressed on numerous occasions a particularly low opinion of the LGBT community. He has compared homosexual relationships between consenting adults to illegal drug abuse, criticized same-sex marriage, as well as supported laws that ban same-sex couples from adopting. Kathy Webb, a gay Arkansas state senator, has said the \\"former governor doesn't seem to have a lot of tolerance and goodwill toward gay people.\\" Huckabee has also been criticized for being photographed with Brian Camenker the head of MassResistance, a social conservative activist group that has been classified as a \\"Hate Group\\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a legal advocacy organization known for its tolerance education programs and legal victories against white supremacists.http://www.nola.com/picayunes/t-p/covingtonpicayune/index.ssf?/base/news-0/1162622544266020.xml&coll;=1 When told Brian was from MassResistance, Huckabee said, \\"I know. I get your emails.\\" Andrew Sullivan is frequently critical of Huckabee, especially his comments that HIV-positive people should be isolated, calling such comments against gays with HIV \\"rancid homophobia\\".http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/.m/the_daily_dish/2007/12/huckabees- ranci.html The family of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager who died of AIDS, has also objected to Huckabee's comments about AIDS. Jay Barth, the co-author of a book on Arkansas politics, has been quoted as saying \\"In terms of public comments that are clearly derogatory toward gays and lesbians or persons with HIV/AIDS, most of those comments come early in his career,\\" and \\"That is not to say he became a progressive on the issue, but he talked about them less.\\" In July 2012, after Chick-fil-A COO Dan Cathy made several public statements supporting what he believes to be \\"the traditional family,\\" saying about same- sex marriage that those who \\"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\\" were \\"inviting God's judgment on our nation\\". Several prominent politicians expressed disapproval. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, and Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno said they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas. The proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union. The Jim Henson Company, which had a Pajanimals kids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, citing unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the controversy. In response to criticism of the Cathy family's support for \\"traditional In response to criticism of the Cathy family's support for \\"traditional marriage,\\". Politician Mike Huckabee created the counter-protest for August 1 called \\"Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day.\\" Controversial statements Over the years, Huckabee admitted to making public statements have drawn criticism. Commenting on another incident comparing Arkansas journalists critical of his policies with disgraced reporters Jayson Blair and Janet Cooke, Huckabee said \\"You'll see itone of the things that gets me in trouble is my love of metaphors. I use hyperbole in the course of trying to paint a word picture. I pay a dear price for it.\\"  American Muslims  In February 2011, Huckabee questioned the decision of two Protestant churches that allowed Muslims to use their facilities for worship, remarking that Islam \\"is the antithesis of the Gospel of Christ\\". In May 2014, Huckabee invited on his Fox News program Islamic feminists Raquel Saraswati and Raheel Raza to discuss the kidnapping of Nigerian schoolgirls by Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram. During the show Huckabee acknowledged that \\"not all Muslims want to kill anyone who is not a Muslim\\", and that knowing so was \\"refreshing\\".  Concentration camp  After a 100-pound weight loss he quipped, \\"I have just come out of six weeks at a concentration camp held by the Democrat Party of Arkansas in an undisclosed location\\". The National Jewish Democratic Council chastised him for what it regarded as a Holocaust reference. Huckabee denied referencing the Holocaust or slighting Jews.  Suicide  Suicide awareness groups criticized Huckabee for mentioning suicide while joking about the fundraising efforts of his primary opponents. He responded \\"I would never intentionally hurt the feelings of anyone for any reason, and I certainly was not making light of suicide, but of the excesses of campaign spending\\".  Mormons  He also asked \\"Don't Mormons believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers?\\" when discussing Mitt Romney's religion. Huckabee apologized to Romney and explained, \\"I asked the question because I had heard that,\\" but \\"never thought it would make the story.\\" After the acquittal of Donald Trump during his impeachment, when Romney was the only Senator in history to vote in favor of convicting a president of his own political party, Huckabee criticized Romney in February 2020 by stating that the worst thing that could possibly happen to the United States would be a Romney Presidency.  Abortion holocaust  October 2007, Huckabee labeled the \\"liberalized abortion\\" of \\"more than a million people\\" who would have joined the workforce since Roe v. Wade a \\"holocaust\\". The Anti-Defamation League called on Huckabee and all candidates to resist using such \\"disturbing and offensive\\" terms.ADL Calls On Governor Huckabee To Refrain From Using Holocaust Imagery ADL.org, October 23, 2007  Canadian igloo  While governor of Arkansas he was asked by host Rick Mercer of the Canadian satiric comedy news show This Hour Has 22 Minutes about Canada's decision to preserve its national igloo. Unaware to the fact that Canada has no national igloo, Mike Huckabee congratulated Canada for preserving it. In subsequent interview Rick Mercer explained that Huckabee had asked if it was a controversial igloo but that he wasn't aware that it was a fake news story.  Illegal immigrants  In December 2007, Huckabee said that Pakistan has more illegal immigrants entering the United States than any country but Mexico. Department of Homeland Security estimated that more illegal immigrants entered the U.S. from Korea, Philippines, China and Vietnam than from Pakistan.  Marriage  In January 2008, in an interview with the website Beliefnet, Huckabee said \\"I think the radical view is to say that we're going to change the definition of marriage so that it can mean two men, two women, a man and three women, a man and a child, a man and animal.\\"  Amending constitution  At a Michigan primary campaign appearance on January 14, 2008, Huckabee said \\"I have opponents in this race who do not want to change the Constitution. But I believe it's a lot easier to change the Constitution than it would be to change the word of the living God. And that's what we need to doto amend the Constitution so it's in God's standards rather than try to change God's standards so it lines up with some contemporary view.\\" Television pundit Joe Scarborough commented that while he believes \\"evangelicals should be able to talk politics ... some might find that statement very troubling, that we're going to change the Constitution to be in line with the Bible. And that's all I'm going to say.\\"  Israel  In 2009, Huckabee criticized American policy toward Israel in front of an Israeli audience. These comments drew accusations from liberal bloggers that Huckabee was \\"bashing America\\", which he denied. Huckabee responded that President Obama's policies were \\"anti-Israel and promise breaking\\", stating, “I have extolled the virtues of the USA at every stop and in every comment, but have stated a position that I have stated for many years — during both Republican and Democratic administrations — that Jerusalem should be a united city.” WikiLeaks On November 29, 2010, Huckabee strongly criticized WikiLeaks and its sources in relation to the Cablegate scandal in which approximately 251,000 U.S. Embassy cables were obtained by WikiLeaks and displayed on its website. Much of the information released was labeled secret and confidential. Huckabee was quoted saying, \\"Whoever in our government leaked that information is guilty of treason,\\" and \\"anything less than execution is too kind a penalty.\\" See also * Arkansas gubernatorial election, 2006 * Who Made Huckabee? * The Huckabee Report References Category:Mike Huckabee Huckabee, Mike ","title":"Public image of Mike Huckabee"},{"id":"24158681","text":"Étienne Vigée, 1773, painted by his sister Louis-Jean-Baptiste-Étienne Vigée (2 December 1758 - 8 August 1820) was a French playwright and man of letters. Born into an artistic family, he was the son of the pastellist Louis Vigée and the brother of the celebrated painter Élisabeth Vigée. He was popular in the salons for his pleasant personality and quick wit. Although employed as a secretary to the Countess of Provence, he wrote verse in praise of the French Revolution, but his enthusiasm quickly faded and he was at one point arrested as a Girondist. He would live long enough to write poetry both in praise of Napoleon and Louis XVIII. He succeeded Sautreau de Marsy as editor of the Almanach des Muses in 1794, and replaced La Harpe at the Lycée, but had nowhere near the same success as a teacher. A skilled imitator of Dorat and Gresset, he put together several clever plays with many points of interest both in style and plotting.

In this game, a successful stockbroker suddenly finds himself embroiled in a world of crime and danger. Gameplay The game is a standard text adventure with static graphics in all versions but the Apple II and Spectrum +3 ones. It focuses primarily on character interaction instead of object interaction. The Amiga version has a \\"speech mode\\", though Computer Gaming World noted it only as a novelty. Development The working title of the game was \\"Upon Westminster Bridge\\". Reception The game was voted Best 8-bit Adventure Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. ACEs reviewer The Pilgrim called it \\"a game that combines powerful programming, wry humour, and a compelling plot all at once. No doubt about it, Corruption is [Magnetic Scrolls'] best yet.\\" In Computer & Video Games, Keith Campbell wrote that \\"the game has very much the same feel as the Infocom mysteries, like Suspect, although I found this plot to be far more interesting.\\" He remarked that Corruption will provide \\"hours of enjoyable frustration\\", and he praised its graphics, noting that \\"an adventure set in offices in the city, doesn't sound particularly exciting graphically, yet Magnetic Scrolls have made it so.\\" Sinclair Users Sarah Sharkey summarized, \\"[T]his game is good. The text is well written, the characters are very realistic and the storyline is believable.\\" She highlighted the game's \\"super interaction with characters\\" and \\"absorbing and realistic game world\\". Mike Gerrard of Your Sinclair wrote, \\"All in all, I enjoyed Corruption far more than I thought I would... but not quite as much as the previous Magnetic Scrolls games.\\" Computer Gaming World in 1989 praised the game's menu features, such as the ability to reveal exits. Charles Ardai in 1992 wrote in the magazine that Corruption was \\"the one clear winner\\" in the Magnetic Scrolls Collection.

He is supposed to have ruled in the mid-14th century, and to be the ancestor of the later kings of Bali. His historicity is, however, not clearly documented. Arrival from Majapahit According to a near-contemporary source, the poem Nagarakrtagama, Bali was subdued by the troops of Majapahit in 1343. In later Javanese and Balinese tradition, this conquest was retold in various versions. Babad Dalem, a chronicle from the 18th century, relates that Bali was in turmoil after the Majapahit invasion. In order to remedy this, the Patih (chief minister) Gajah Mada raised the Javanese nobleman Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan as vassal ruler of Bali. Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan was the grandson of a Brahmin but himself belonged to the Ksatria caste. His mother was a spiritual being, an apsara. His two elder brothers were vassal princes of Blambangan and Pasuruan on Java. Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan established his palace (puri) in Samprangan, in the Gianyar regency. With him went nine aristocrats from Java, who settled around the palace and assisted the ruler in his governance. Another grandee, Arya Gajah Para, settled at Tianyar on the north coast. However, the old population in the highland villages, the Bali Aga, violently resisted rule by the Javanese immigrants. Their recalcitrance almost drove the king back to Java. Hearing about the trouble besetting his vassal, Gajah Mada sent a magic dagger (keris), Ki Lobar, to Samprangan. With its help, Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan overcame all resistance. At his death he was succeeded by his son Dalem Samprangan, but the princely residence was within short moved from Samprangan to Gelgel near the south coast.C.C. Berg, De middeljavaansche historische traditië. Santpoort: Mees 1927, pp. 103-6. Cultural and historical context The story of the Majapahit conquest of Bali and the immigration of Javanese to the island has had an enormous impact on the self-image of the Balinese. Balinese cultural ideals are traced back to Javanese models, and Majapahit stands as a powerful symbol of civilization. The historical background of Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan's reign on Bali is controversial. A copper inscription, supposedly dated 1471, mentions a Ratu Pakisan from Majapahit who appears to be the same figure. That would place him more than a century later than the Majapahit conquest, although the authencity of the inscription remains to be verified.http://vxu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:206791/FULLTEXT01 p. 19. Also, his youngest son Dalem Ketut, who founded the Gelgel palace, is supposed to have survived the fall of Majapahit on Java (early 16th century). The oldest dated account that mentions the origin of the Balinese kings, a geographical text by the Portuguese Manuel Godinho de Erédia (c. 1600), asserts that these kings were descended from the rulers of Blambangan in East Java.H.

They were orphans raised by a rich landowner named Clifford Downey and his dancer wife, Mona Rowland-Downey. Upon her death, Mona leaves her entire ranch in Santa Barbara, California in the care of only one son, Ruben. The other brother begins plotting how to win control of the property away from his estranged twin. Ruben's main concern at the moment is that his wife Laura has left him. She cannot comprehend how her loving husband could have cheated on her with another woman. Ruben tracks her to Chicago, where he meets used-car salesman Lou Perilli. He is assured that Laura will come back to him eventually. In the meantime, being pursued by a tough customer named Nick Zangaro about a debt he owes, Lou decides to make a quick getaway out west to Santa Barbara. Eddie Agopian, a family lawyer, is in charge of watching over Ruben's interests. But suddenly he disappears. Local authorities, including Sheriff Otis and a corrupt judge, have begun harassing Ruben and the dozens of workers and friends who live at the ranch. They are the stooges of powerful businessman Reed Tyler, who has business interests with Ruben's brother, Robby. Lou becomes a partner to the timid Ruben by promising to help him with his legal troubles. Lou has no lawyer experiences, but begins doing some investigating on Ruben's behalf and does the best he can in court. He also helps Ruben track down Eddie, who has absconded to Mexico with a stash of money. A scam is exposed, revealing to Laura that it was not her husband who had relations with another woman but Robby, his evil twin. Ruben, Laura and Lou quickly hatch a scheme of their own, catching the sheriff and judge in compromising positions and luring Robby into one with the help of a couple of young women hired for the occasion.

Maharana Raimal was the son of Rana Kumbha. He came to power by defeating his patricide predecessor, Udai Singh I in battles at Jawar, Darimpur and Pangarh. Early in Raimal's reign, Ghiyas Shah of Malwa attacked Chittor unsuccessfully. Soon after, Ghiyas Shah's general, Zafar Khan attacked Mewar and was defeated at Mandalgarh and Khairabad. By marrying Sringardevi (daughter of Rao Jodha), Raimal ended the conflict with the Rathores. During Raimals' reign, Raisingh Toda and Ajmer were recaptured. Raimal also strengthened the state of Mewar and repaired the temple of Eklingji in Chittor. The last years of Raimal's rule were marked by conflict between his sons with Prince Sanga (later Rana Sanga) having to flee Chittor. The sons, Prithviraj and Jaimal were both killed. At this difficult juncture, the Rana was informed that Sanga was still alive and in hiding. Raimal summoned Sanga back to Chittor and died soon afterwards.Sharma, Dasharatha (1970). \\"Lectures on Rajput History and Culture\\". pp 79-84. Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi.  Ascent to the throne  Raimal was not the heir-apparent, he was younger to Udai Singh I. But as fate would have it, Udai Singh I killed his father, the legendary Rana Kumbha, while he was praying to Lord Eklingji (Shiva) and ruled for five years. He was a weak ruler and under his reign Mewar lost Abu and Ajmer, both states were made independent by the weak ruler of Mewar. After being defeated by his brother Raimal, he fled to Malwa in order to please the Sultan, however Udai Singh was struck by lightning and died on the spot. The Sultan promised help to Udai's sons Surajmal and Sahasmal in exchange for their fealty.  Raimal fights the sultan and his nephews  Sultan of Malwa, Ghiyath Shah fought against Rana Raimal of Mewar, allying with Surajmal & Sahasmal (sons of Udai Singh I) in which Sultan was defeated. Surajmall survived and was pardoned by Rana Raimal. After defeating the Sultan, Rana Raimal caused much disruption in Malwa. Raimal also defeated an army under Ghiyat Shahs general Zaffar khan sent to avenge sultan's previous defeat. He also defeated Ghiyat Shahs successor, Nasir Shah in 1503-04,who had a particularly ineffective venture in Mewar  Fight at Sadri  Surajmall and Raimal's armies met at Sadri, a town that Surajmall had captured. Raimal's son Prithviraj joined his father at a crucial time in the war and directly attacked his cousin Surajmall. Their conversation in the evening after day's war was epic, representing the true character of a Rajput warrior. Many such skirmishes occurred till Surajmall finally left mewar and settled at Pratapgarh where his descendants still flourish and keep up the name of Sisodia clan. Prithviraj was later killed by poisoning by the Abu Deora chief and thus made way for Sanga's return when Jaimal died.

He is the editor of the Journal of Economic Theory. Biography Hellwig obtained a B.A. in Economics at the University of Lausanne in 1998, a M.Sc. in Econometrics and mathematical economics by the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1999, and a Ph.D. in Economics at LSE in 2002. He spent the last two years of his doctorate as a visiting scholar at MIT. He became an Assistant Professor at UCLA in 2002 and became a tenured associate professor in 2007. Hellwig took up the position of Associate Professor at Toulouse School of Economics in 2010 where he is currently employed. In addition to his academic position, Hellwig is a Research Affiliate at the Centre for Economic Policy Research since 2007 and became the editor of the Journal of Economic Theory in June 2008. He is a member of the Board of Editors of the American Economic Review since April 2007. As an undergraduate he spent time studying abroad at Oberlin College, where he played on the men's basketball team. He is the son of the famous economist Martin Hellwig.  Research contribution  Hellwig studied the effects of exogenous and endogenous public information in global coordination games and showed that multiplicity of equilibria is restored under fairly general conditions. Global coordination games belong to a subfield of game theory which started with the article by Morris and Shin (1998). Steven Morris and Hyun Song Shin considered a stylized currency crises model, in which traders observe the relevant fundamentals with small noise, and show that this leads to the selection of a unique equilibrium. This result is in stark contrast with models of complete information, which feature multiple equilibria. However, there are potential problems with this result due to the lack of a theory of prices in global coordination games (Atkeson, 2001). Hellwig studied the effects of exogenous public information in global coordination games and showed that this may restore multiplicity under fairly general conditions (Hellwig, 2002). Hellwig and co-authors (2006) address the concern by Atkeson (2001) by considering a more explicit market structure and model the public information endogenously as an interest rate signal. They show that equilibrium multiplicity may be restored by the endogenous public signal, provided that private information is sufficiently precise, which coincides with the findings by Angeletos and Werning (2006).

A Western revenge story in a contemporary setting, its plot concerns three punk rockers from New York City who attempt to make their way to California. When one of them is murdered by a vicious gang leader, the other two, played by Cryer and Roebuck, find themselves fish out of water as they pursue the murderer from Arizona to Montana, assisted by a tow truck driver played by Stewart. Continuing Spheeris' theme of highlighting the punk subculture as in her prior films The Decline of Western Civilization (1981) and Suburbia (1984), Dudes features several rock musicians in various roles, including Fear singer Lee Ving as the gang leader, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea as the murdered punk, and John Densmore of the Doors, Axxel G. Reese of the Gears, and punk artist and promoter \\"Mad\\" Marc Rude in minor roles, as well as punk rock band the Vandals performing in the opening scene. Spheeris had previously worked with Ving in The Decline of Western Civilization, and with Flea and the Vandals in Suburbia. Dudes was shown in only a few theaters and did not receive a wide release through a film distributor. Several parties involved in making the film, including Spheeris, later attributed this to its mixing of multiple genres and tones. Written as a dramatic, action-filled \\"punk Western\\" set in the modern era, the finished film also contained elements of comedy, road movies, and a heavy metal soundtrack, the combination of which made it difficult to market. It received a home video release on VHS, through which niche interest in the film persisted in subsequent decades. In 2017 it was given a new release in the DVD and Blu-ray formats. Plot Grant, Biscuit, and Milo are punks living in Queens. Bored with their lives, they decide to move to Los Angeles, and set out on a cross-country drive. In Utah they assist Elvis impersonator \\"Daredelvis\\" with getting his trailer unstuck. Later, Grant sees a mirage of a cowboy on horseback. While camping in the Arizona desert they are attacked by a gang of vicious rednecks, and Milo is murdered by their leader, Missoula. Grant and Biscuit escape and collapse in the desert, where Grant again sees a vision of the cowboy. The local sheriffs do not believe the boys' story, having no record of Missoula or his gang and being unable to find Milo's body as evidence of the murder. Grant resolves to track down the gang and avenge Milo's death, despite Biscuit's reservations. Heading back into Utah, they find one of the gang's trucks overturned and several of the members dead. Before dying, one of them reveals that they planned to turn themselves in but were killed by Missoula, who is headed north through Wyoming to Montana. The boys also meet Jessie, a young woman who runs a gas station and towing business. Catching up to Missoula's truck, Grant and Biscuit engage in a high- speed shootout with Missoula and his buddy Blix, but swerve off the road and crash. They are rescued by Jessie, who teaches Grant how to shoot and ride a horse and strikes up a romance with him. Meanwhile, Biscuit has a dream in which he is part of a Native American tribe who are slaughtered by Union Army soldiers led by Missoula. Upon awakening, he begins to imitate a Native American warrior and insists on resuming the pursuit. Jesse outfits the pair in exaggerated western costumes and gives them use of a beat-up 1959 Buick Invicta complete with bull's horns mounted to the hood. In Wyoming, the boys find Daredelvis working at a rodeo and enlist his help to capture gang member Wes, from whom they recover Milo's stolen jacket, but Wes is killed by a bull without revealing Missoula's location. On the way to a ghost town where Missoula is rumored to be hiding, Grant once again sees the mysterious cowboy, but Biscuit dismisses it as an illusion. Finding the town empty, the pair get drunk and have a vision in which they meet the cowboy, named Witherspoon, accompanied by a trio of Native American warriors from Biscuit's dream. Witherspoon magically transports Grant back in time to when the town was populated and raucous, while the Native Americans similarly transport Biscuit back in time to participate in a tribal gathering. Awakening hung over, Grant finds a matchbook in Milo's jacket that leads them to a saloon in a Montana town where they find Missoula and Blix. Trailing them into a movie theater, Grant and Biscuit open fire on the pair, but Grant hesitates and a shootout ensues; Missoula and Blix escape, while Grant and Biscuit are arrested and jailed. Missoula and Blix murder two sheriff's department officers and invade the jail in an attempt to kill the boys, but Jessie arrives just in time to break them out. Grant manages to kill Blix and wound Missoula, and pursues him on horseback to an abandoned building, where he tackles Missoula off a high ledge. Missoula shoots Grant in the arm and Grant returns fire, killing him. Grant once again sees Witherspoon and the Native American warriors, now accompanied by Milo, who ride off into the distance and disappear in a cloud of dust just before Biscuit and Jessie arrive.

Development Director Penelope Spheeris in 1984 In writing Dudes, scriptwriter Randall Jahnson was partly inspired by visits to Old West locations which he felt were \\"frozen in time\\". In the early and mid-1980s, he later reflected, the punk and art rock scenes in Los Angeles were demonstrating a certain fascination with the West, exemplified by Wall of Voodoo performing cover versions of Spaghetti Western songs, the Dead Kennedys covering \\"Rawhide\\", and the Meat Puppets mixing punk with country music, which influenced his crossing of the two genres in his script. He settled on the film's title based on the Old West use of the term \\"dude\\" to describe a \\"tenderfoot\\" or \\"fish out of water\\", city- dwelling Easterners unprepared for life on the frontier, seeing his main characters as modern \\"dudes\\". Jahnson pitched his script to producer Miguel Tejada-Flores of independent film company the Vista Organization as \\"punk rockers out in the wilds of Wyoming\\", which Tejada-Flores thought was an interesting idea, though a bit \\"out there\\" conceptually. He and fellow producer Herb Jaffe sought Ridley Scott to direct, but could not agree with him on the film's \\"vision\\". Penelope Spheeris first read the script in March 1986 and expressed interest. Tejada-Flores had been impressed by her previous directorial work, particularly her 1985 film The Boys Next Door, and felt that she could tell an enthralling story from the mix of genres present in Jahnson's script. He showed The Boys Next Door to Jaffe, and the two agreed that Spheeris was a good candidate to direct, a choice which was solidified when she convinced them that she could make the film within their proposed budget and get good performances out of her actors. Jahnson was a fan of Spheeris' 1981 punk rock documentary The Decline of Western Civilization, and agreed that she had the \\"punk rock sensibility\\" for the script. Cinematographer Robert Richardson, who had recently finished working on Platoon (1986), personally approached Spheeris and expressed interest in working with her. Tejada-Flores and Jaffe had been impressed by Richardson's prior work, but did not think they could afford him; however, Richardson agreed to work within their cinematography budget. Casting A 1959 Buick Invicta similar to the one used in Dudes. Cryer had very little driving experience, and had difficulty driving the full-size car. Spheeris wanted Jahnson to be part of the casting process, and invited him to many of the casting sessions, which was not common practice for directors. Jon Cryer, who had recently gained attention for his role in the hit film Pretty in Pink, was attracted to the eclectic nature of Dudes' script as well as the opportunity to play the hero, which he had not done before. Spheeris favored Cryer for the film's lead but also considered Keanu Reeves, and chose Cryer at Jaffe's suggestion. To prepare for the role Cryer learned how to ride a horse and fire a gun, and got his ear pierced since the script called for Grant to wear an earring; the heavy earring caused the piercing to become infected. Being young and eager to play the hero, he performed many of his own stunts. He had difficulty with the scenes that required him to drive a car; He had earned his driver's license while performing in Torch Song Trilogy in Los Angeles several years prior, but used public transport and taxis in his native New York City and had very little experience behind the wheel. Catherine Mary Stewart became interested in the role of Jessie because \\"she was a strong female character, which is important, and also was somebody who could ride horses, shoot a gun, she owned a garage...Part of my fantasy when I was a little girl was to do exactly all that stuff, and when I came on the set I had an idea of what my character should be and what I sort of developed for myself, and [Spheeris] was very supportive of that.\\" In preparation for the role she trained with a stunt performer who specialized in gun play, learning how to twirl her revolver so it would slide right into its holster. \\"I was practicing that all the time,\\" she later recalled, \\"because I wanted it to be great.\\" Daniel Roebuck, a character actor who had recently finished filming River's Edge, was reading scripts in search of new roles and was struck by the uniqueness of Dudes. \\"It was not a John Hughes movie\\", he said in 2015. \\"There was nothing like it. When I read it all I thought of was 'I want to be in a Western.' I was a little concerned about the punk rock stuff, but I really liked the Western stuff.\\" For his audition in front of Spheeris he wore a mohawk hairstyle, since that was what the script called for his character, Biscuit, to have. When given the part, he had to have the sides of his head shaved and his hair tied into place for the duration of filming since it was too time- consuming to take apart and re-tie the mohawk for each shoot. Roebuck was not into punk rock, however, describing himself as a \\"square\\", and was so embarrassed to wear his hair in a mohawk every day that he convinced the crew to get him a wig to wear on days off from shooting. Spheeris had featured Lee Ving's band Fear in The Decline of Western Civilization (1981), and stayed in touch with him. It was through Ving that she met Flea, who had joined Fear in 1982 as the band's bassist. Thinking he had a star quality, she cast him as one of the runaway punks in her 1984 film Suburbia. By 1986 Flea was active in the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Spheeris reached out to him to be in Dudes, later saying that he brought to the role \\"a certain vulnerability and a certain sweetness that actually wasn't written into the script, and played it in such a sweet, loving way that when the moment came that [his character is] killed in the movie, it was more powerful, because [he was] so lovable before that, and people don't expect that moment.\\" Flea felt honored to be cast, since Dudes was a chance to work alongside trained actors whereas in Suburbia he had been among a group of \\"street kids\\" similar to himself, all without acting experience. Another musician cast in Dudes, though in a minor role, was John Densmore, former drummer of the Doors. Jahnson met with the surviving members of the Doors while working on his script for The Doors (1991), a biographical film about the band; Densmore had moved into acting, knew Spheeris, and had heard about Dudes, and asked Jahnson if there might be a part for him in it. Jahnson spoke with Spheeris, and Densmore was cast as one of the Montana sheriffs who is murdered by Missoula late in the film. Production The gang attack scene was filmed at the Vasquez Rocks. Scenes of the boys driving through the desert were filmed along U.S. Route 163 in Monument Valley. Principal photography for Dudes began on August 14, 1986. The early scenes set in Queens were filmed in Hollywood, with establishing shots of the New York skyline and other buildings edited in to create the illusion of being in New York City. The opening scene, a punk rock show with the Vandals performing their song \\"Urban Struggle\\" (with its opening lyric \\"I want to be a cowboy\\"), was the first to be filmed. Cryer and Roebuck both had musical theatre backgrounds and were not very familiar with punk rock, and neither had been in a mosh pit before. Cryer later remarked that he found it to be rough, but fun and less violent than he had expected. Roebuck, however, recalled that he and Cryer were being trounced by the extras, who were actual punks, and that first assistant director Guy Louthan's plea to the crowd to \\"not hurt the real actors\\" only caused them to be targeted more. Stunt doubles were used for some of the action, and the one standing in for Roebuck punched one of the punks squarely in the face. Flea, who had been to many punk rock shows, had no problem filming the scene: \\"That was very controlled in comparison to, like, a Black Flag show at the Starwood where people are getting sent out to ambulances all the time, and getting their heads really stomped in for having the wrong hair and shit...so I felt comfortable and fun in that environment\\", he recalled 30 years later. A scene in which Grant, Biscuit, and Milo nearly fall off of a fire escape was shot in downtown Los Angeles with the actors at ground level, then edited together with shots of stuntmen dangling from a higher level. A scene in which Grant flirts with a woman played by Pamela Gidley and gets into a brawl with her boyfriend was filmed at popular punk hangout the Atomic Cafe. Production then moved east, outside of Los Angeles. The redneck attack and Milo's murder, set in Arizona, were filmed in Agua Dulce, California at the Vasquez Rocks. The rodeo scene, set in the fictional town of Peckerville, Wyoming, was filmed in Clarkdale, AZ . Some of the desert scenes were filmed in the Four Corners region, including Monument Valley on the Arizona-Utah border; filming in this region was delayed by inclement weather including dust storms and rain. Filming in Arizona lasted four weeks, with additional location filming taking place in New Mexico and Utah. For one of the driving scenes, Spheeris suggested that Cryer, Roebuck, and Flea sing \\"Hava Nagila\\" while headbanging to show that their characters were enjoying their road trip; this inspired a scene in Spheeris' later hit comedy Wayne's World (1992) in which the main characters sing along to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" while driving and launch into headbanging. Catherine Mary Stewart joined the crew midway through filming to perform her scenes, including the jailbreak scene set in the fictional town of Crossfire, Montana, which was filmed in Cottonwood, Arizona. She had a lifelong passion for horses and was an experienced rider, so enjoyed filming the horseback riding segments, but suffered a broken ulna when she stopped her horse abruptly to avoid hitting a parked vehicle and was thrown into the vehicle herself. This occurred toward the end of filming her scenes, so it did not significantly impact the shooting schedule. While filming the climactic showdown between Grant and Missoula, Ving heard that there was asbestos in the building being used and refused to re-enter it, so the sequence had to be rewritten and edited to show less of his character. Spheeris liked Flea's performance so much that he was asked to return to filming so that his character could appear in the final scene, which had not been in the original script. Music Kathy Nelson, who worked at MCA Records, served as a music editor on Dudes and brought in several artists to appear on the film's soundtrack. At the time, the Los Angeles punk rock scene was giving way to heavy metal; Spheeris liked both genres, and worked them both into the soundtrack, although she later thought this caused confusion regarding the tone of the film. Her next film, The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years (1988), would document this new heavy metal scene. Soundtrack album MCA records released the soundtrack album for Dudes, which featured several artists from the Los Angeles area including an early version of \\"Mountain Song\\" by Jane's Addiction and a new recording of Megadeth's cover version of \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\" (their original recording of the song had been released on their 1985 album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!). The Vandals contributed a new recording of \\"Urban Struggle\\", which had been an early hit for the band. Only guitarist Jan Sakert and drummer Joe Escalante remained from the lineup that had recorded the original version, released on Peace thru Vandalism (1982); the Dudes recording featured new singer Dave Quackenbush and bassist Chalmer Lumary. In a retrospective review, Jon Bush of Allmusic rated the soundtrack album 3 stars out of 5 and pointed to the Megadeth track and Steve Vai's version of \\"Amazing Grace\\" as highlights. Track listing Writing credits adapted from the film's credits reel. Additional songs used in the film but not included on the soundtrack album include \\"Bathroom Wall\\" by Faster Pussycat, \\"Dirty Pool\\" and \\"Dead Dog Man\\" by the Little Kings (a group featuring Gore Verbinski), \\"Guitarget\\" by Four Big Guitars from Texas, \\"Yard Dog\\" and \\"Rock 'n' Roll Till the Cows Come Home\\" by the Tail Gators, \\"Waltz Across Texas\\" by Ernest Tubb, \\"Cocaine & Whiskey\\" by Ned Sublette, a rendition of \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" performed by Robert Gordon and Chris Spedding, and renditions of \\"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\\" and \\"Mexican Radio\\" performed by Vance Colvig. Release Dudes was initially scheduled for theatrical release in April 1987, but this date was pushed back multiple times. It was screened at the 1987 Toronto International Film Festival that September. The Vista Organization struggled to find a film distributor willing to give the film a wide theatrical release. \\"We were a small indie company,\\" reflected Tejada-Flores 30 years later, \\"we had money to make indie films, and we co-financed a distribution company, but we didn't have the clout and the budget that the bigger distribution companies had\\", feeling that the larger distributors viewed Dudes as too strange, and too dissimilar to mainstream films, to pick up: > We wound up with a movie that was both true to and exceeded the multiple > genres of the script, and the script wasn't one thing or another. It's a > punk rock Western; well, what does that mean? It's a modern Western; what > does that mean? It also has supernatural elements, but it's got punk rock, > it's got a bunch of rock and roll, it's got a human story, it's got comedy, > it's got romance...so which one do we sell it as? Spheeris felt similarly upon reflection, saying that \\"when we were looking to get it released, the distributors just didn't get it. You know, punk rock was born in the late '70s, and then by the time we got to '86 and '7 it was still around, but I started integrating some metal in [the film], you know. So the distributors, they still didn't know about punk rock. They were like \\"Punk rock? Oh, no...Heavy metal? No, no.\\" So we had two strikes right there.\\" Flea agreed with this: \\"It has punk rock it in it, it has the Vandals, but it's not a punk rock movie. And then it has this sort of Western thing, this cowboy thing, but it's not a Western movie. And it has kind of a metal element too, but it's not a metal movie. Culturally, it doesn't really sit in a perfect place for people to pigeonhole.\\" Although Jahnson's script was written as a dramatic, action-filled \\"punk western\\" and not a comedy film, Spheeris felt that her comedic instincts, as well as Cryer's, influenced the tone of the finished film. Cryer later viewed Dudes as a bridge between Spheeris' prior dramatic films Suburbia (1984) and The Boys Next Door (1985) and her later success with the hit comedy Wayne's World (1992). Dudes ultimately received only a limited release in a few theaters, opening in New York on June 24, 1988 and in Los Angeles a week later. The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin gave it a middling review, saying that it \\"has a more commercial tone than some of Miss Spheeris' earlier films, which is to say it's filled with scenic, largely unmotivated events and lacks conviction. Tongue-tied dialogue ('This country, man - it's like a Road Runner cartoon. Beep, beep!') is another problem. Still, there are enough eccentric touches to hold the interest, like the exuberantly vicious Mr. Ving in his villain's role, and the character calling himself Daredelvis (Pete Willcox), who has somehow worked a lot of Presley mannerisms into his act as a rodeo clown.\\" She felt that Cryer and Roebuck \\"have a wholesomeness that doesn't entirely suit their characters\\", but praised Lee Ving's performance, saying \\"Mr. Ving was made for villainy, and he's at least as well suited to bad-guy acting roles as he is to punk posturing.\\" Critic Michael Wilmington also gave the film a mixed review in the Los Angeles Times, calling it \\"an entertaining movie from a bad script.\\" He criticized Jahnson's script as \\"one more out of the VCR cookie-cutter: a revenge Western in the old Henry King-Henry Hathaway mold\\" and for being \\"stripped to minimal, car-chase, '80s limits and spiced up with slapstick and an allegedly colorful subculture—which isn't very well portrayed\\", but complimented the cinematography and directing, saying \\"the deep-focus, scorching cinematography of Robert Richardson (Platoon) is more than movies like this usually give you. Director Penelope Spheeris handles the material with relish. Spheeris has an eye and a sense of humor, and she keeps everything overripe and zingy. She's also cast interesting actors who keep going pleasantly over the top, as in a good Abbott and Costello movie\\", singling out Ving and Roebuck's performances as examples. Home media A VHS copy of Dudes from 1991, the only format on which the film was available until its release on DVD and Blu-ray in 2017. In October 1987, Heron Communications filed a lawsuit against the Vista Organization regarding home video rights to Dudes and nine other Vista-produced films, claiming that Vista was attempting to renege on its commitment to license home video distribution of its films to Heron due to a possible merger with Carolco Pictures. Vista claimed that it had no such arrangement with Heron. Dudes was eventually released to home video in VHS format in 1991 by Avid Home Entertainment, a division of Artisan Entertainment. It was on VHS that, like The Decline of Western Civilization, Suburbia, and The Boys Next Door, Dudes found a niche audience in subsequent decades. Reviewing the film from a VHS copy in 2005, film critic Emanuel Levy rated it a 2 out of a possible 5. Writing for Not Coming to a Theater Near You in 2011, Victoria Large called it \\"something of a bridge between the cult, punk films that started [Spheeris'] career and the slick Hollywood comedies that the director is perhaps more widely associated with. And while it’s true that melding the spiky strangeness of Suburbia with the agreeable silliness of Wayne’s World makes for an uneven viewing experience, Dudes is also a fun watch.\\" Placing it in the \\"punk western\\" subgenre alongside other 1987 films Straight to Hell and Border Radio, she remarked that Dudes is \\"most memorable for its loopy flourishes\\" and \\"at its most self-conscious when it comes to its co-option of western tropes\\", concluding that \\"while Dudes takes pains to reclaim the western for its spiky-haired leads, therefore placing it in conversation with past westerns and with other countercultural films [...] I'm not sure that it adds that much to the discussion, or even that it means to. But its utter weirdness is a virtue, and there's a playfulness here that charms.\\" In 2015, critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a B- rating, calling it an \\"off-beat road adventure comedy\\" that \\"has some Easy Rider vibes going for it\\", concluding that \\"the violent clash between cultures makes for absurdist adolescent drama, but it's weirdly entertaining.\\" In 2017, Dudes was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Shout! Factory under their Shout Select imprint, the original film print given a 2K resolution transfer to the more modern digital formats. As added features for this 30th anniversary release, Spheeris conducted interviews with Cryer, Roebuck, and Flea reflecting on the making of the film. Separate interviews with Stewart and with Jahnson and Tejada-Flores were also included. During the lead-up to the release, Spheeris' alma mater UCLA hosted a screening of Dudes at the Hammer Museum in January 2016 with Spheeris, Jahnson, Cryer, Roebuck, Stewart, and Pete Willcox (who played Daredelvis) in attendance, as part of a two-night tribute to the director. Spheeris also hosted a screening of the film at the Laughlin International Film Festival in October 2017, at which she was presented a Lifetime Achievement award for her film work.

It was produced at the request of sportswear maker Adidas as a part of its \\"Adicolor\\" viral ads campaign, in which advertising agency IDEALOGUE gathered seven directors, assigning a different color to each of them, and asked them to produce a feature based on their emotional and creative response to the given color, later to be distributed in the form of podcasts. The four-minute film, shot by Trent Opaloch in Blomkamp's usual handheld camera mockumentary style, deals with an Israeli military robot gone rogue. Plot summary The film begins by depicting the development process that eventually results in the creation of the main character. It is explained that in a robotics laboratory, five androids were created as part of an experiment, each one identified with a different color, but one turned out to be different. The yellow one developed the ability to think and learn, to the point that it escaped the institute in which it had been created and became a part of society for 18 months. Rather than seeing humans as enemies or a threat to its own survival, it was \\"making decisions, and observing us and learning.\\" A SWAT team is sent after Yellow, chasing him through several countries and finally tracking him down in Shanghai. The film concludes during the encounter between the android and the SWAT team, with a voice over suggesting the birth of a new era, with AI becoming part of our society. Production Yellow was written by Terri Tatchell and Neill Blomkamp. Production was done at RSA Production, which is owned by director Ridley Scott. Trent Opaloch, who also worked with Blomkamp on the film District 9, was the Director of Photography. Visual effects were done by Blomkamp's own VFX company Ratel.

The library system is the information center in Atlantic County. The Library System includes nine branch libraries located throughout Atlantic County: Brigantine, Egg Harbor City, Egg Harbor Township, Galloway Township, Hammonton, Mays Landing, Pleasantville, Somers Point, and Ventnor.http://www.atlanticlibrary.org/branches The computerized public access catalog contains over 500,000 books, audio-visual and downloadable items. Atlantic County Library System also has a bookmobile, books-by-mail, and other outreach services.http://www.atlanticlibrary.org/about_us History The Atlantic County Library was founded in 1926 following a public referendum which was held in compliance with the law for establishing a county library. All communities were automatically included in the library’s services except Atlantic City which already had a municipal library. The first librarian was Jane Brown and the library’s first location was a room on the ground floor of the American Legion building on West Second Street in Mays Landing. By the end of 1926, the total collection was 13,000; there were four local libraries, eight deposit stations, 57 grammar schools with collections as well as four high schools with beginning collections. The first Children’s Librarian was employed in 1930. The 1950s were the expansion years and the beginning of a building, equipment, and contingency fund. In 1952, the library owned 49,000 volumes and 5,543 requests. In 1967 grants of $15,000 were available which were renewable for five years; the county library received a grant to develop a good reference collection. The library was also able to purchase a new book truck partially using State Aid. In 1969 the library owned 80,977 volumes and circulated 241,143 materials. The 1970s was a time for study, appeals, and plans. The library appealed a cut in State Aid allotment resulting in partial restitution of funds. The Library Commission formed a five year plan for improving staff, resources, and services in the libraries. Each year the size of the staff increased along with stock, equipment, and services. The Cape- Atlantic Consortium was formed in 1972 to apply for a grant for a Union Catalog of Reference Books. In 1973 the Commission obtained legal ruling on its autonomy and powers. In 1979, the Atlantic County Library System took shape when the County Board of Chosen Freeholders passed a $3.75 million bond issue for construction of libraries in Hammonton, Egg Harbor Township, and Mays Landing. ACLS was the first library system in the state to be built on an innovative decentralized concept, building three regional libraries instead of one central library. In 1979 the Library Director, Joe Green, envisioned a new library system as a shift \\"from the time honored notion that library services should be provided where all patrons are expected to go for library services. That's an archaic belief in an electronic world.\\" ACLS was also the first fully computerized public library system in New Jersey in 1980. Community libraries were linked through the computer system. In 1983, a pre-fabricated building was erected in Brigantine, the first of its kind in New Jersey. In 1985 Galloway Township became a branch of the Atlantic County Library System and in 1990 a community branch in Longport was added. Mission The mission of the Atlantic County Library System is to offer informational and recreational materials which will educate, enlighten, and enrich the lives of area residents.

The original music score was composed by Ennio Morricone. Ryan O'Neal was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Actor of the Decade. Plot  At Chippenango State College (fictitious), Bobby Fine (Ryan O'Neal) is a professor of English, who learns during a meeting with Chair Lincoln of the English Department (Fred Gwynne) that he is a candidate for tenure at the college. During the meeting, Fine impresses Lincoln by responding in kind to an obscure line from William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. Another professor (David Rounds) is amazed, and Bobby explains that with his father in the dress business, he'd always liked the play. Meanwhile, in New York City, Bobby's father, Jack Fine (Jack Warden) walks into luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman attempting to steal customers with an arm-load of his own company's dresses before he is chased out by the manager (Michael Lombard). Back at his office, Jack checks in with his staff, and it becomes clear that his company, Fine Fashions, has excess inventory, poor designs, and high debt. When a buyer for another company (Jessica James) visits the office, Jack reluctantly arranges a sexual liaison with her to secure a sale. Adding to Jack's woes, he receives a phone call summoning him to a meeting with the imposing Mr. Eddie (Richard Kiel), a powerful loan shark and gangster holding a note on a $150,000 loan taken out by Jack, which has grown to a $1,500,000 debt. During the meeting, Jack confesses he can't pay it, and Eddie instructs him that he will take over the business and force Bobby to run it. Eddie's henchmen (Tony Sirico and Michael LaGuardia) kidnap Bobby and bring him to Jack's house, informing the Fines that they are to meet with Eddie at his club. There, Bobby is struck by the beauty of Eddie's wife, Lira (Mariangela Melato). Bobby and Lira are strongly attracted to each other during the meeting, and after suddenly kissing, Lira informs Bobby that she is open to infidelity. The following day, a montage rolls as Bobby visits with the different employees at Fine Fashions, attempting to learn the business. During the montage, a satirical song from the Ennio Morricone score (Union Label) plays as the employees smoke marijuana and generally laze about in comic fashion. The employees agree that Bobby is a fool. At the end of the day, Bobby is met by Lira, who invites him into her limousine. She takes Bobby back to Eddie's mansion, and tells him that her marriage to Eddie is a loveless one, arranged to repay her own father's debts, and seduces him. Eddie comes home early, agitated because his game of pinball was interrupted by tilting. Bobby rushes to hide, while Lira hurls his clothing into the fireplace and hides his shoes in a house plant. As a result, after Eddie goes to sleep, Bobby is forced to wear an outfit of Lira's when he leaves. Outside, while inspecting the pinball machine smashed earlier by Eddie, the snug women's jeans tear, exposing Bobby's buttocks; desperate to cover his exposure, Bobby stuffs wadded up plastic into the seat. When he returns to the office, he stumbles into a group of garment buyers who have just dismissed Jack's latest fashions. They mistake Bobby's kludged together outfit for a radical new design, and are eager to make huge orders for the jeans, which are dubbed \\"So Fine.\\" Following is a commercial for the titular jeans, featuring models dancing and flashing their buttocks to the camera, interspersed with shots of women wearing the jeans (with the buttocks individually exposed through clear plastic windows) and driving men to distraction. Bobby and his father are preparing to repay Eddie the $1,500,000, the success of the So Fine jeans having secured their fortune. Bobby has returned to his professorship at Chippenango State College, and Jack has a meeting with Eddie at his house. Before Jack arrives, however, Bobby's shoe (previously hidden in a plant) falls and strikes him in the head. Reading the sole (\\"Chippenango Campus Shoes\\"), Eddie realizes that it must belong to Bobby. Lira flees from the house to find Bobby, and Eddie rushes after her. When Jack arrives, the maid (Angela Pietropinto) tells him the situation, and Jack joins the chase. Lira finds Bobby, and they make plans to flee the country, but first attend a campus performance of Giuseppe Verdi's opera, Otello. During the performance, the soprano performing Desdemona (Judith Cohen) is struck ill, and Lira (whose own operatic ambitions had been frustrated by marrying Eddie) steps into the role, performing magnificently. Eddie arrives, and knocks out the tenor playing Otello and assumes the role. As he joins Lira, Eddie also sings splendidly, but the subtitles do not reflect the action of the play, but rather that Eddie is there to kill Lira and Bobby. Eddie and Lira struggle back and forth, until Jack arrives and swings down on sand bags, knocking out Eddie. Much like with the So Fine jeans, the audience mistakes the performance for a bold revision of Verdi's original and applauds wildly. Later, Bobby and Lira are being propelled down the canals of Venice by a gondolier, and Bobby is reading a personal annulment of Lira and Eddie's marriage signed by Pope John Paul II (a farcical \\"marrigisimus annulum\\") and the camera pans to a gelato cart vendor serving a group of children. As the vendor turns away, it is seen that she is wearing So Fine jeans, and as she walks away, the credits roll. Cast * Ryan O'Neal - Bobby Fine * Jack Warden - Jack Fine * Mariangela Melato - Lira * Richard Kiel - Eddie * Fred Gwynne - Chairman Lincoln * Mike Kellin - Sam Schlotzman * David Rounds - Professor McCarthy Production According to the film's producer, Michael Lobell, the idea for So Fine originated with himself, from his firsthand experience in the garment industry, first through his father, who manufactured dresses, and then through his own experience as a successful designer of clothing in the Mod style. Lobell explained that he went to Bergman with the story idea, which then led to Bergman penning the script. Bergman, for his part, told William Wolf, of New York, that after being taken on a tour of the Garment District, he was taken by the chaotic nature of the environment, and imagined how a college professor like himself (Bergman holds a PhD in American history) would have managed if forced into such hectic surroundings, and the plot developed from the juxtaposition of a crazed world with an ordered personality. So Fine also received positive pre-release attention due to the main plot device, the see-through buttocks of the jeans (which, in the film, become a mass hysteria and take the nation by storm). Costume designer Santo Loquasto said he'd intentionally constructed the design as a sendup of those coming out of “Fashion Avenue,” the stretch of Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, which runs through the traditional Garment District. In one scene, an elaborate commercial for the jeans, choreographed by Grover Dale, plays out. Loquasto had designed a custom set, wildly illuminated and featuring dozens of models in the see-through jeans, arching towards the camera. Loquasto amusedly observed that despite he and the filmmakers intentionally aiming to be outrageous, he was amazed to regularly return from the set and find television commercials he felt were even more so. Wolf reporting in a piece published several months before So Fine’s release, visited the Filmways Studio and found the pairing of Richard Kiel and Mariangela Melato entertaining in a scene he viewed. Wolf's article highly praised Bergman, considering him (along with Albert Brooks, another active comedy filmmaker of the 1980s) one of the few positive contributors to the comedy genre in film. Bergman's previous writing credits were for Blazing Saddles (which Bergman initially sold to Warner Bros. as Tex X, a play on Malcolm X) and The In-Laws, neither of which Bergman had felt positively about, yet both of which were commercial and critical successes. In a New York interview, Bergman said that after his experiences with Blazing Saddles and The In-Laws, he was sure that So Fine was going to be a big hit, so he decided that he would direct the film, in order to be certain that what he thought of as a surefire screenplay would transition to the big screen with his vision intact. Pre-screenings were positive, but two weeks after the film's release (on September 25, 1981), Bergman was disappointed to see the film gone from the theaters. Bergman attributed the failure to the high-brow styling of his comedy being mismatched with its low-brow trappings. O'Neal was cast at the suggestion of Warner Bros. His fee was a reported $2 million. Critical reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. Janet Maslin, then of The New York Times, complimented the casting, expressing that O’Neal and Melato might seem odd selections, but both ably filled their respective roles; Maslin also admired the scenes between O’Neal and Warden, observing the chemistry between the two actors. She did find female characterizations disappointing, contrasting the sexually predatory nature of the female characters with the score-keeping attitudes of the male protagonists. However, Tom Shales of The Washington Post was summarily unimpressed by So Fine's satire, considering its main gimmick (the see-through jeans) topically ripe for satire, but ultimately wasted and imbecilic. Shales had particularly harsh words for the film's two leads, O'Neal and Melato for, respectively, a one- note acting style and a weathered, scrawny appearance. Box office So Fine was filmed on a budget of $9,800,000, and in its three weeks in theaters, grossed a total of $9,381,808, and was considered a financial loss. In culture In 1996, Joanne Slokevage filed a patent for a “garment rear,” which described cut-out areas on the rear of various bottom garments (pants, shorts, dresses, etc.), which a closure-secured fabric flap would cover or uncover, as the wearer chose. The patent was eventually rejected in Federal Circuit Court as unregistrable. In Slokevage's patent filing, a non-patent citation is included referencing So Fine. Prior to Slokevage's patent filing and publication, in a pre-release interview, Lobell said that neither he, nor Bergman, nor Warner Bros (the distributor of So Fine) had immediate intentions to manufacture the jeans from the film, he did note that between the producer, director, and distributor, they collectively held a copyright on the design, and had consulted with manufacturers. However, there is no record of any dispute between the three parties and Slokevage with respect to patent D410689.

Conteh studied medicine at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria and taught at Ibadan Teaching Hospital. He later returned to Sierra Leone where he joined the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Lassa fever program at Nixon Methodist Hospital in Segbwema, first as superintendent and then as clinical director. After the Sierra Leone Civil War began in 1991, the CDC closed their program in Segbwema. Conteh and his medical team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), where he spent the next two decades running the only dedicated Lassa fever ward in the world. Conteh collaborated with the British charity Merlin to promote public health in Sierra Leone through education and awareness campaigns intended to prevent Lassa fever. With little funding and few supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and saved many lives until an accidental needlestick injury led to his own death from the disease in 2004. Conteh received renewed public attention in 2009 as the hero of Ross I. Donaldson's memoir, The Lassa Ward. Early life, education, and teaching Aniru Sahib Sahib Conteh was born on 6 August 1942, in the town of Jawi Folu, Eastern Province, British Sierra Leone, the son of a farmer and chief of the village. He moved to Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, after his mother died while he was in his teens. Conteh studied chemistry and biology at Fourah Bay College and began teaching after receiving his BSc. In 1968, he began studying medicine in Nigeria at the modern University of Ibadan, graduating in 1974. Conteh spent the next four years employed by the Ibadan Teaching Hospital. He returned home to Sierra Leone in 1979. Conteh married and raised a family with his wife Sarah, producing several sons and daughters.Some sources report four sons, others report three; , \\"four sons, two daughters\\"; : \\"three sons and two daughters\\"; , \\"four sons, and two daughters\\"; , \\"three sons, and two daughters\\". Medical career Conteh spent his professional career working with people with Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa. Lassa fever was first brought to the attention of the public in 1969 during an outbreak in Nigeria.; Identified in 1972, the disease is known to spread through its host, the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), and infects an estimated 300,000 people and results in 5000 deaths annually in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea.; In 1976, a hospital-acquired infection outbreak in the Panguma Catholic Hospital attracted attention in the United States. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established research programs in Segbwema, Kenema, and Panguma to study the disease.; Nixon Methodist Hospital Aniru Conteh in a 1989 CDC documentary about Lassa fever In 1979, Conteh began working with the CDC and team leader Joseph B. McCormick at the Nixon Methodist Hospital in Segbwema. Conteh became Medical Superintendent of the hospital in 1980. The Sierra Leone Civil War broke out in 1991, forcing the CDC to close their program and move to Guinea. The hospital was destroyed in the conflict and the spread of Lassa fever grew worse. During the civil war, the Natal multimammate mouse infested abandoned houses, increasing the likelihood of infection.; : Rat meat is an important source of protein in this region, and if the animal is carrying the disease the virus can be killed by boiling the meat. However, infection can take place during the process of finding and preparing the rats for consumption. The virus is transmitted through rat urine and feces, which can enter the body through inhalation, eating food contaminated with excreta, or through skin absorption. Kenema Government Hospital Conteh now found himself in the middle of a war zone, starving and homeless.: \\"I was so shocked. I had no idea what to do. There was no food or even a safe place to sleep.\\" Hungry and in a state of perpetual danger, he wandered for months around the countryside. \\"At some point,\\" he said, \\"I even became numb to the fear.\\" He wandered about for several months and finally came to Kenema where he began treating the sick in the midst of the fighting. Although he had friends overseas, and could have procured a job outside Sierra Leone, he chose to stay and help his people because \\"they had no one to help them\\". Due to the war, most experts familiar with Lassa fever had left the country, and patients suspected of having the disease began to be brought to Conteh for treatment. The Lassa team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). In Kenema, Conteh became director of the only Lassa fever isolation ward in the world. Rebels from the Revolutionary United Front took over the town of Kenema in 1997 and 1999, but Conteh never left his post.; It is thought that the rebels spared the hospital from destruction because they were afraid of catching Lassa fever. When the civil war ended in 2002, the government of Sierra Leone began the process of rebuilding the country. Contributions to medicine Conteh established the Lassa Isolation Ward at Kenema Government Hospital after the CDC moved its facilities to Guinea due to the civil war in Sierra Leone During the civil war, Conteh was the only clinician in Sierra Leone who had the skills and qualifications to manage patients with Lassa fever. In the absence of the CDC, the Lassa ward was supported by Merlin, a medical relief agency based in the UK.; ; ; According to Nicholas Mellor, co-founder of Merlin, \\"Conteh worked with Merlin to get a new laboratory built that would enable collaboration with international research centres with an interest in haemorrhagic diseases. He also worked on training and Lassa fever awareness campaigns.\\" Conteh's Lassa fever program \\"provided the blueprint for many experts\\".; For more information about the important role of Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), see In 1996, Daniel Bausch at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine began working with Conteh and the CDC on research related to Lassa fever. In 2000, Conteh coauthored a study published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology comparing the efficacy and outcome of diagnosing Lassa fever patients with the indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). According to Iruka N. Okeke, the study \\"focused specifically on the development of a diagnostic test for Lassa fever\\".; ; In 2001, Conteh travelled to London, England to attend an international conference on Lassa fever where he presented a paper on managing the disease. Conteh returned to London in September 2003 to receive the \\"Spirit of Merlin\\" award for his outstanding role in \\"saving lives and alleviating suffering\\".; Death The Lassa ward was short-staffed, and Conteh would often draw blood from people himself.; A 2003 WHO/UNHCR report recommended the hiring of additional support staff for Conteh in 2003. See On 17 March 2004, Conteh was infected with the Lassa virus when he received a needlestick injury while drawing blood from a young pregnant nurse with the disease. The nurse died the next day, and Conteh himself became ill on 23 March. As his condition worsened, he was treated with intravenous ribavirin. Conteh initially survived the critical stage of Lassa fever, but died on 4 April from renal failure—18 days after first becoming infected with the Lassa virus. Reporter Sulaiman Momodu described the outpouring of grief in the wake of Conteh's death: Conteh's funeral was held in the town of Daru. Legacy Conteh's work in the Lassa ward spanned 25 years and saved thousands of lives.; : \\"He spent much of his professional life fighting the disease, and saved thousands of lives by developing a regimen of intensive medical care.\\" He played a key role in helping Merlin implement a program to support the Lassa ward and fever control measures in Sierra Leone. Because of his skill and dedication, deaths due to cases of suspected Lassa fever declined by 20%.: \\"His skill in diagnosis and treatment was unparalleled, and resulted in a reduction in mortality of suspected Lassa fever cases to around 20 per cent.\\" However, Okeke reports that Conteh's \\"clinical research and treatment advances contributed greatly to an 80 percent reduction in mortality from the disease by 2000.\\" See After Conteh's death, Merlin and the peacekeepers in the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) left Sierra Leone and the Lassa ward in Kenema was barely functioning. In 2004, Tulane University, in co-ordination with the World Health Organization, began monitoring Lassa fever patients in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea through the Mano River Union Lassa Fever Network (MRU-LFN).; Today, the Lassa Fever Program is fully operational at Kenema Government Hospital, and focuses on \\"treatment, containment, prevention and research\\".

The film is based on the true story of Sonny Wisecarver. Set in the 1940s, the feature stars Patrick Dempsey, Beverly D'Angelo, Michael Constantine, Betty Jinnette, Kathleen Freeman and Peter Hobbs. The film opened on September 16, 1987 in New York City and on September 18, 1987 in Los Angeles, California and Toronto, Canada. When the movie expanded to 361 screens on October 16, 1987, it took in $315,000 in its first three days of wider release. Plot Based on a true story, 14-year-old Sonny Wisecarver, nicknamed the Woo Woo Kid, is a teenage casanova who has an affair with his older neighbor, a 21-year-old mother of two, and then runs off with her to get married. When the law catches up with the pair in Colorado, the pair is returned to California where a judge annuls the marriage. The judge sentences her to three years' probation, orders her to go to a church to obtain \\"moral training\\", and she is also ordered to repay the county for the cost of transporting the couple back from Colorado. Sonny was sent to live with an aunt in Northern California, and ordered to stay away from his former wife. After moving back home, Wisecaver meets and runs off with another woman, a 25-year-old mother of two and wife of a decorated soldier, and soon thereafter finds himself before the same judge who ruled him incorrigible and sent him to a youth camp, while she was sentenced to three years' probation for contributing to the delinquency of a minor and fined $250. The public and the media were more fascinated than outraged by Sonny's romantic prowess, with the press nicknaming him the \\"Compton Casanova,\\" the \\"Love Bandit\\" and the \\"L.A. Lothario.\\" But Life magazine came up with the nickname that stuck: \\"The Woo Woo Boy, the world's greatest lover.\\" Cast * Patrick Dempsey * Talia Balsam * Beverly D'Angelo * Michael Constantine * Betty Jinnette * Kathleen Freeman * Peter Hobbs * Tony Longo * Douglas Rowe * Ernie Lively * Kim Myers Production and background In 1977, the Los Angeles Times ran a story titled “Whatever happened to Sonny Wisecarver”. Screenwriters Bob Kosberg and David Simons decided to write a screenplay about Wisecarver, who sold them the rights to his story for $500, plus seven percent of what they made selling the screenplay. However, Kosberg and Simons were not able to purchase the screen rights from the two women who were romantically involved with Wisecarver, so their names were changed in the script. The pair convinced Peter Bart, who at the time was head of Lorimar Productions to buy the script, but nothing ever became of it. Seven years later in 1984, Los Angeles Magazine ran another “Whatever happened to Sonny Wisecarver” story and this time producers Karen Mack and Gary Adelson thought it would make a good movie. Adelson went to his father, Merv Adelson, a co-founder of Lorimar, eventually learning from his father that Lorimar already owned the rights to the story. Adelson and Mack went to Phil Alden Robinson about writing the screenplay, but Robinson said he wasn't interested because he assumed the movie would be a teen comedy. After reading the article in the Los Angeles Magazine, Robinson decided he would write the screenplay. As he was writing the screenplay, Robinson also lobbied to direct the movie as a first-time director. The film's working title at that time was The Woo Woo Boy. Robinson stated that every situation that was portrayed in the film actually happened in Sonny's real life; that nothing was made up for the movie. Transcripts from the court proceedings were used verbatim and quotes from newspapers and magazine were copied directly from articles that were published at the time. The time frame was the only aspect of the movie that was fictionalized, which was condensed from two years to six months and Wisecarver's age was changed to fifteen due to the shorter span of time being depicted. Principal photography began on August 25, 1986. The film was finished in October and had a $7 million budget. San Pedro and Long Beach, California were the principal locations for the film, with additional scenes filmed in Eagle Rock, Mt. Baldy, Echo Park, San Bernardino, Perris and Fillmore, California. People Magazine reported in 1987 that the real Sonny Wisecarver made about $14,000 selling the rights to his story. He also had a cameo role in the film as a mailman who proclaimed the Sonny character as a pervert. The original VHS from Lorimar Home Video contained an interview with Wisecarver before the film.

And additionally, \\"as a period piece, In the Mood is a bit ragged around the edges, lacking the flawless '40s look and feel of the more generously budgeted Swing Shift...In the Mood is fun but it could have been sharper\\". The New York Times said in their review that \\"if the events depicted in In the Mood were not in fact based on Sonny's true story, they wouldn't be credible for a second...it reserves its greatest warmth for the era in which the action takes place. And the 1940s are indeed affectionately recreated here, with big-band music, elaborate costumes and well-chosen billboards in the background everywhere\\". Film critic Roger Ebert wrote \\"this kid named Patrick Dempsey is the perfect choice to play Sonny. He's got the wisecracking spirit of one of Neil Simon's autobiographical heroes, but he also has a certain saintly simplicity, a way of not seeing all the things that could go wrong...the movie is comfortably set in its period, the mid-1940s of Roosevelt and rationing, Glenn Miller and Woody Herman, and a national hunger for headlines that were not about the war...the period is established without being allowed to overcome the picture, which finds a gentle offhand way to get its laughs; usually we're laughing, not at punch lines, but at human nature. Critic Dennis Schwartz wrote \\"the genial comedy has its funny moments, but overall lacks a knockout punch\\".https://www.firstlight.net/~ozus/inthemood.htm On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64% based on reviews from 11 critics. In the Mood opened in theaters on September 16, 1987 with a weekend gross of $45,118 and the film has a domestic total gross of $999,382.

It was created in 1976 as a regional organization of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. Previously based in Ottawa, Ontario, it is now headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina. NAPPO Mandate NAPPO has a global and a regional mandate. The global mandate comes from Article IX of the New Revised Text (1997) of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The main activity under this mandate is to cooperate with the IPPC Secretary in achieving the objectives of the Convention and, where appropriate, cooperating with the Secretary and the Commission in developing international standards. The goal of the IPPC is to protect the world's cultivated and natural plant resources from the spread and introduction of plant pests while minimizing interference with the international movement of goods and people. The regional mandate for NAPPO was formalized by Canada, the United States and Mexico in a Cooperative Agreement signed in 1976 at the Minister/Secretary of Agriculture level. The NAPPO Constitution and Bylaws confirm that NAPPO is accountable to the Minister/Secretary of Agriculture in NAPPO member countries. NAPPO Mission NAPPO’s mission is to: \\\\- Provide a forum for public and private sectors in Canada, the United States and Mexico to collaborate in the development of science-based standards intended to protect agricultural, forest and other plant resources against regulated plant pests, while facilitating trade. \\\\- Participate in related international cooperative efforts. Strategic Goals A satellite composite image of North America. Clickable map In order to accomplish this mission, the following strategic goals have been established: • Protecting plant resources and the environment • Capacity building • Communicating results • Building partnerships • Offering an effective dispute settlement mechanism • Working with sound management practices • Working with a stable funding base Responsibilities NAPPO has responsibilities at the regional, hemispheric and global level. Regional: Developing regional phytosanitary standards which facilitate the safe movement of plants, plant products and other regulated articles into and within the NAPPO region is a key responsibility. Once a subject has been identified, experts representing the member countries meet in order to develop s draft standard which is submitted to a wider country consultation before final approval. Industry participation in the entire process is encouraged. Examples of standards developed so far include standards for commodities such as potatoes, stone and pome fruit trees, grapevines, citrus and plants for planting; standards for the regulation of biocontrol agents, products of biotechnology and non-Apis pollinating insects; standards for other regulated articles such as wood packing materials and other generic standards such as accreditation of officials to issue phytosanitary certificates. In addition, NAPPO provides technical support to the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Committee of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Hemispheric: NAPPO is a member of the Interamerican Coordinating Group in Plant Protection which brings together the regional plant protection organizations of the Americas to coordinate their efforts in protecting the hemisphere from the entry, establishment and spread of regulated pests. This group provides the opportunity to discuss emerging pest situations, to coordinate our control efforts and to provide technical assistance. NAPPO also works with other hemispheric organizations such as OIRSA and COSAVE on topics of mutual interest. Global: On a global level NAPPO supports the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention by assisting in the development of international standards for phytosanitary measures and monitoring their application in the NAPPO region. It works with other Regional Plant Protection Organizations by exchanging information on current phytosanitary issues at their Annual Technical Consultation and to support the work program of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures of the IPPC.

Sommers served as a Social Credit Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1952 to 1958, representing the riding of Rossland-Trail in the province of British Columbia. He served as Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines from until his resignation February 27, 1956. He was tried and in 1958 was convicted of bribery and conspiracy making him the first cabinet minister in the British Commonwealth to serve a term of imprisonment for accepting bribes in connection with his office.  Early life  Born in Leduc, Alberta in 1911, Sommers was the son of J. L. Sommers and Elsie Armonies, both natives of Germany who came to Canada in 1889. Before entering politics, Sommers was an elementary school principal in Castlegar, BC. He was a trumpet player, a local band leader, a part-time insurance broker, a Kiwanis club president and a volunteer firefighter. He was married twice: first to Marion Henry in 1930 and then to Nona Samson in 1940. Political career He was first elected as an MLA under the banner of the British Columbia Social Credit League as the member for Rossland-Trail in 1952. He was re-elected in 1953, and 1956. In each election, against several opponents, his popular vote exceeded 50% of the votes cast including his last after he lost his cabinet position. Sommers resigned his seat automatically upon his conviction on November 7, 1958, for bribery and conspiracy. Scandal and trial Sommers downfall began when the Liberal opposition, particularly MLA Gordon Gibson accused Sommers of impropriety in the granting of a forest management licence to E. P. Taylor's British Columbia Forest Products (BCFP). These licences were a new form of tenure in the forests of British Columbia introduced in 1948 based on the 1944 recommendations of the Sloan Commission. Large companies were given cutting rights over Crown land in perpetuity and in exchange were responsible for forest management, construction of access roads and fire fighting. The goal was to provide a sustained yield to supply mills over the long term by giving the licence holder a long-term interest in the productivity of the land. Forest management licences were extremely valuable. There were accusations that companies made huge profits selling shares issued after a licence was granted before a single tree had been cut. E. P. Taylor's Argus Corporation, which incorporated British Columbia Forest Products to run its BC forest operations in 1946, had been turned down for a forest management licence in 1948. After he became the cabinet minister in charge of granting forest management licences, Sommers, who was then in awkward financial circumstances personally, had meetings with Taylor and the management of Argus at which BCFP sought a licence. Taylor, BC premier W. A. C. Bennett and Sommers met at the Empress Hotel in January 1955. Afterwards, Bennett directed Sommers to make the deal. The result was that BCFP was granted FML #22 which covered between Port Renfrew and Estevan Point along the west coast of Vancouver Island. A commission led by Justice Arthur Lord found no basis for the charges and Sommers responded to the accusations by suing Vancouver lawyer David Sturdy for libel. The Bennett government stonewalled in the legislature on the basis that the matter was before the courts until Sommers was dropped from cabinet in 1956. In November 1957 he was arrested and charged with bribery. The next year, he and Wick Gray were convicted. BCFP was acquitted. Sommers was sentenced to 5 years in prison but was released after 28 months. While imprisoned, he learned the piano tuning trade. He established a piano business on Vancouver Island after his release in 1961. Sommers was convicted on five of seven charges of receiving bribes. He was found to have received $607 worth of rugs, $3,000 in bonds, $1,000 in cash and $2,500 sent by telegraph making him the first person in the Commonwealth found guilty of conspiring to accept bribes while serving as a Minister. Aftermath During his time in prison, Sommers learned the trade of piano tuning and restoration from a fellow inmate. He took up residence on Vancouver Island after his release and established a business in that field.

The exact dating of his reign is unclear; the sources point at either the second half of the 14th century or the early 16th century. Reign According to the 18th-century chronicle Babad Dalem,I Wayan Warna et al. (tr.), Babad Dalem. Teks dan Terjemahan. Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Daerah Tingkat I Bali. Dalem Samprangan succeeded his father Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan who had been established as vassal king by Majapahit after the conquest of Bali in 1343. His residence was Samprangan in the present-day Gianyar regency, to the southeast of the ancient royal seat Bedaulu.Margaret J. Wiener, Visible and invisible realms: Power, magic, and colonial conquest in Bali. Chicago & London: Chicago University Press 1995, p. 110. The chronicle characterizes him as an incompetent and vain figure. He spent much time on his outward appearance, and let his ministers wait in the council hall for him to show up. This behaviour irritated the grandees of the kingdom. After waiting for hours in vain one morning, one of them, Kubon Klapa, left the palace in anger and looked up Dalem Samprangan's youngest brother Ketut, who was a well-known gambler. He persuaded the prince to take royal titles and offered him his residence in Gelgel, a village in the present-day Klungkung residency, near the south coast. In that way, the Samprangan palace quickly lapsed into obscurity, while Gelgel rose as the political centre of the island under the new king Dalem Ketut.C.C. Berg, De middeljavaansche historische traditië. Santpoort: Mees 1927, pp. 123-4. No more is heard in the Babad Dalem about Samprangan which became a minor village immediately to the east of Gianyar.Adrian Vickers, \\"Central Bali: Gianyar Regency\\", in Eric Oey (ed.), Bali: Island of the gods. Berkeley: Periplus, p. 113. Conflict with Dalem Tarukan A complex of legendary texts called Babad Pulasari relate the fortunes of Dalem Samprangan's other brother Dalem Tarukan, who had a residence close to modern Ubud. He fell out with his royal brother which resulted in a series of internecine wars on the island. At length, Dalem Tarukan was defeated, and his descendants were demoted from the Ksatria caste. Certain Balinese texts date the defeat of Tarukan in 1502.http://vxu.diva- portal.org/smash/get/diva2:206791/FULLTEXT01 , p. 20. This is incompatible with the Babad Dalem, which indicates Dalem Samprangan about one generation after the Majapahit conquest of 1343. The historical background of these persons and events is therefore uncertain. Place in the list of Balinese rulers In the central Balinese temple Pura Besakih, the most important shrine is Pura Padharman Dalem Gelgel, which honours a series of six ancient Balinese kings. After Dewa Tegal Besung (often identified as Dalem Ketut), who is accorded a meru (tower-like structure) with 11 roofs, Dewa Samprangan follows with a meru with 9 roofs, in turn followed by Dewa Enggong (Dalem Baturenggong) and three later kings.David Stuart-Fox, Pura Besakih: Tempel, religion and society in Bali. Leiden: KITLV Press 2002, p. 118. Dalem Samprangan is also listed as king in the early religious text Usana Bali, as successor of Ken Angrok and predecessor of Dalem Baturenggong.R. Friederich, \\"De Oesana Bali\\", Tijdschrift voor Neerland's Indië 9-3 1847, p. 286. Ken Angrok is otherwise known as the founder king of Singhasari on Java All this complicates the question of his original place in the succession of Balinese rulers.

Though not a hit, it was liked as a study of a boy-girl relationship. Plot Penfield was a girls school in 1955. The curriculum ranged from Latin to Etiquette, from Shakespeare to Field Hockey. Abigail is one of the new girls coming in to learn about these and other subjects. Coming from a well to do family, she hopes to be the school's best student. Just as she is getting started in the school, she meets Michael, a male student in the school. Soon the two fall deeply in love, but their relationship becomes challenged by those around them, leading to difficulties and tragedy. At the center of the movie is the friendship between Abigail and Muffy at an all-girls boarding school. The film concludes with Abigail being the only one of the two who graduates.

He was also a leader in reform and philanthropic work. He was also a member of the Detroit Athletic Club and one of the donors who created the Detroit Institute of Arts (originally known as the Detroit Museum of Art).  New England Roots  Cyrenius Newcomb Sr. was born to Hezekiah and Nancy (Rounds) Newcomb in Cortland, New York, November 10, 1837. His family can be traced to the Newcombs who were actively involved in the American Revolution.http://www.rkwest.com/personal/thenewcombs/?page_id=23 He was educated at Bridgewater Normal School (Massachusetts). He married Mary Haskell in Hartford, Connecticut. The couple had four children: Dr. William Wilmon Newcomb, Cyrenius A. Newcomb Jr., Mary Newcomb (who later married William E. Fuller Jr. and lived in Fall River, Massachusetts), and Howard Rounds Newcomb. After Mary (Haskell) Newcomb died, he married Mary Sharp in Detroit in 1899. Early business career Newcomb Sr. began working at age 18 at a dry goods business in Hannibal, New York. Two years later he was employed as a clerk at N.H. Skinner of Taunton, Massachusetts, another dry goods store. Nine years later, he became a partner in the business. In 1868, Newcomb Sr. sold his interest in N.H. Skinner and moved to Detroit, establishing a dry goods store on the corner of Jefferson and Woodward avenues, near today's Hart Plaza. Three years later, the store moved to the first floor of the original Detroit Opera House Building. By 1881, the store moved again to a location on Woodward Avenue which the J.L. Hudson's Department Store later occupied. In the mid-1880s, Newcomb Sr. was one of the donors who gave money to establish a permanent arts museum, now called the Detroit Institute of Arts.  Partnership with John Endicott  Newcomb-Endicott, circa 1910s Massachusetts native and Harvard graduate John Endicott came to Detroit in 1891, becoming head bookkeeper of Newcomb's enterprise. He was “admitted as a member of the firm” in 1896 and became treasurer when Newcomb-Endicott was incorporated as a department store in 1903.Burton, C.M. The Book of Detroiters, 1912. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Watson, who died, and then in 1902 to Mary Elizabeth Booth and had three children. His other endeavors included being director of the Michigan State Agricultural Society, and owner of a large stock farm near Birmingham where he bred Hackney horses. Newcomb-Endicott Co. was Michigan's first department store, founded in 1868, predating the J.L. Hudson Co., Crowley-Milner Co., or the Ernst Kern Co. Detroit Athletic Club connection When the Detroit Athletic Club (DAC) was reorganized in the early 1910s, merging with the Wolverine Automotive Club and the remnant of the nearly defunct original organization, Newcomb-Endicott was picked as the contractor to provide much of the original interior furnishings. The front section of the April 17, 1915 edition of Detroit Saturday Night was devoted almost exclusively to how the DAC was built. The store was given an “honorable mention” in the Detroit Saturday Night paper, which described how it provided “carpets and rugs of handsome design and exquisite workmanship.” Newcomb- Endicott had been chosen among Detroit's other department stores because its “ability to handle big orders of this kind has been demonstrated often before in the equipping and furnishing of other public buildings,” the paper continued. Other activities Newcomb Sr. was president of Newcomb-Endicott up until the time of his death in late 1915, but had abandoned an active role in the business due to failing health. also enjoyed automobiling.

The US Bolling Commission bought a license to build the engine in the US, and small numbers of a slightly revised version were built by the Duesenberg Motor Corporation as the King-Bugatti. Probably about 40 King-Bugattis were made before the end of World War I caused building contracts to be canceled.http://home.uni-one.nl/bugatti/revue3/rev3-3.htm#king Design and development The U-16 engine was designed to use as many features of a previous Bugatti 8-cylinder in-line \\"straight-eight\\" engine as possible. Two eight-cylinder banks were mounted vertically side by side on a common cast aluminium crankcase, each bank driving its own crankshaft. The two crankshafts were geared to and drove a single common airscrew shaft. The shaft was bored to accept a 37-mm gun barrel, and a clear passage was provided through the crankcase in line with the shaft boring for the same purpose.Jane's fighting aircraft of World War I, originally published by Jane's Publishing Company, 1919, re-printed by Studio Editions Ltd, London, 1990, pps 275-277, Each eight-cylinder bank was made up of two cast iron four-cylinder blocks; the crankshafts were each made up of two standard four- cylinder crankshafts joined end to end by a fine taper cone joint. To reduce overall length, these crankshafts were undercut: a typical Bugatti approach, where only their unlimited budget and attention to detail could afford such complexities. A bevel gear at the junction drove a vertical shaft from which the single overhead camshaft and dual magnetos for each bank were driven. Two magnetos were mounted on the outside of each cylinder bank. Each magneto fired all eight cylinders for that bank, driven by bevel gear from the vertical shaft that also drove the bank's single overhead camshaft. Each cylinder had two vertical inlet valves and a single vertical exhaust valve, all driven by rocking levers from the camshaft. Four carburettors each fed four cylinders via a water jacketed manifold. Each cylinder exhausted into an individual pipe in the space between the cylinder blocks. The whole construction was protected by patents until 1935.L'Ebé Bugatti, 1966, \\"The Bugatti Story\\", Editions de la Table Ronde & L'Action Automobile, first British edition 1967, Len Ortzen (translator) and Souvenir Press Ltd, London, pps 70-72, p162 The engine completed ten-hour and fifty-hour endurance tests in 1917, and the French government purchased a license and arranged for production by Peugeot. During the fifty-hour test a US sergeant who was observing the test for the Bolling Commission was killed by the propeller, becoming the first US serviceman to die on active service during World War I. The Bolling Commission and the \\"Bugatti mission\\" In 1917 a US military mission headed by Colonel R.C. Bolling visited Europe to choose aero engines to be produced for the Aviation Section, Signal Corps. The mission was accompanied by a group of civilian experts headed by the engine manufacturer Howard Marmon. The Bugatti U-16 aroused interest and Marmon arranged for a license to be purchased for $100,000 by the US government. In December 1917 a \\"Bugatti Mission\\" sailed from Bordeaux for the US to supervise production of the engine at the Duesenberg Motor Corporation of Elizabeth, New Jersey, where the engines were planned to be made. US revisions The US government engaged Colonel Charles Brady King, to redesign the engine for production in the US, much to Ettore Bugatti's irritation.The Design Council, London, 1979, \\"The Amazing Bugattis\\", Heinemann Educational Books, , p 66 Col. King was then an aeronautical mechanical engineer for the Signal Corps, and head of its division of engine design. A prototype engine was sent to McCook Field near Dayton, Ohio after only 37 hours of testing. It was then decided to send it with Colonel King to Duesenberg for further development. In February, 1918, this engine blew apart due to structural weakness.William Pearce: Duesenberg Aircraft Engines: A Technical Description. Old Machine Press 2012; p 44 King improved some of the design details of the engine, such as the lack of water cooling around the valve seats and the close pitch of valves. Accordingly, King's revisions to the design altered the cylinder heads to provide freer water circulation, better valve cooling, and a slight increase in the distance between valve centres. Post World War I developments Neither Bugatti's U-16 or the King-Bugatti were particularly successful engines. Few were installed in aircraft, and even fewer actually flew. After World War I no further developments were made in the US, while in France Breguet took over the license and continued development under the designation \\"Type U-24\\". In 1920 Breguet showed a \\"quadrimoteur\\" made of two Type U-16s coupled together, with provision to de-clutch any cylinder bank to enable it to be stopped while the other three units continued to provide power.

Biography Aryeh Stern was born in 1944 in Tel Aviv, and studied at the HaYishuv HaChadash yeshiva, led by Rabbi Yehuda Kolodetsky. Stern then moved to the Hebron Yeshiva in Jerusalem, and after a short while to the Mercaz HaRav Kook yeshiva, following his rabbi who served as its head, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook. After Rabbi Stern married, he commenced his studies for dayanut, Jewish- religious judgeship, in the Tel Aviv kolel of Rabbi Ephraim Bordiansky, who also instructed Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. Rabbi Stern fought in the Six- Day War in the Combat Engineering Corps, and in the Yom Kippur War. Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook appointed Rabbi Stern and Rabbi Yochanan Fried to establish the Halacha Brura and Berur Halacha Institution, which Rabbi Stern has since run. The Halacha Brura was one of the chief works of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the father of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook. The institution is known for its method of Talmud study, first developed by Rabbi A.I. Kook, in which the final Halachic opinion of Maimonides and the Shulchan Aruch is summarized, alongside the approaches of other commentaries. Following the passing of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook in 1982, Rabbi Stern was appointed as lecturer in the Mercaz HaRav Kook yeshiva. He also lectures in other yeshivas, including Yeshivat HaKotel, Yeshivat Kiryat Shmona, Yeshivat Or Etzion, and Yeshivat Hesder Petah Tikva. Rabbi Stern was the head of Hadrom high school yeshiva in Rehovot, and was one of the founders of the Ma'aleh School of Television, Film and the Arts for the religious-national sector in 1989. In addition, he has been instrumental in the organization of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook's House in Jerusalem, an active museum of Rabbi Kook's life, and in the establishment of the Merchavim Institute for training teachers and religious educators. Over the years, Rabbi Stern has written hundreds of Halachic responsa and religious-philosophical articles regarding Jewish thought. Alongside his religious and educational activities, he serves as congregational rabbi at the Har Horev synagogue in the Katamon neighborhood in Jerusalem. Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem Rabbi Stern was elected Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem on 22 October 2014. The position had been vacant for eleven years, following the passing of the former Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, Rabbi Yitzhak Kolitzm in 2003. Rabbi Stern was elected by a majority vote of 27 of the 48 representatives from the city's synagogues, city councils, and voters appointed by Naftali Bennett. He had been elected the candidate of the Religious Zionism sector in 2009. He faced a series of obstacles by political opponents, including motions in the Supreme Court to disqualify him from running due to an expired rabbinical certificate, and an attempt to postpone the elections until after his seventieth birth day when he would become ineligible to submit his candidacy. Rabbi Stern's election was backed by Ministry of Religious Services minister, Naftali Bennett, leader of the Bayit Yehudi party, and by Jerusalem mayor, Nir Barkat. Alongside Rabbi Stern, Rabbi Shlomo Amar was elected as the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of the city. Among the supporters of Rabbi Stern were rabbis Haim Drukman and Aharon Lichtenstein, two prominent leaders of the modern-orthodox in Israel, the Rebbe of Erlau, a member of the Moetzet Gedolei HaTorah, and Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel. The rabbis of Tzohar also supported Rabbi Stern. Upon his election, Rabbi Stern said, \\"It is in my intention to serve as the rabbi of all Jerusalemites: secular, modern-orthodox and charedi alike. The Jerusalem rabbinate is a great merit, but it also comprises a hefty responsibility. I will make sure that the religious services will become accessible and friendly and will serve as an outstanding model for all of the other rabbinates in Israel\\". On 28 December 2014, Rabbi Stern was appointed by President Reuven Rivlin as a member of the Chief Rabbinate Council of Israel. Positions Rabbi Stern at his desk *Rabbi Stern pledged that as the rabbi of Jerusalem he would organize kiddushim for religious and secular people, held once a month in synagogues around Jerusalem after the prayers. *He opposes cultural-religious segregation of sectors where each sector lives in their own neighborhood, and supports the establishment of mixed neighbourhoods of both religious and non-religious. *He has said that he is interested in returning the kashrut level in Jerusalem to its status fifty years ago, when it was perceived as very mehudar (referring to mehadrin: the highest standard of kashrut). He has been proactive in checking kashrut and addressing corruption in the Jerusalem Religious Council to improve supervision. *With regard to the place of women in prayers, he said: \\"In the world I knew from the times of my mother and my grandmother, there was no such demand, and it was also apparent in the posekim of the time. Our grandmothers did not want it. Today, however, the situation is different, and one cannot claim old arguments exercised in past generations... it is clear that one needs to renew things, basing it on the Halakha, of course\\". That is why he supported expanding the Women's Gallery at the Western Wall to the same size of the men's section, and also allowed placing a Sefer Torah in the women's gallery at the times of hakafot (encirclements at the synagogue) on Simchat Torah. *Regarding acceptance of religious homosexual couples, he said he would accept them at his synagogue, in the same way he accepts Shabbat violators, though he would not appoint them as congregational cantors. He opposes the Pride parade in Jerusalem. *He has called to abolish the Talmud and Torah matriculation exams.

The Lafayette Library and Learning Center is also home to the Glenn Seaborg Learning Consortium, a partnership with the region’s leading arts, culture, and educational institutions. The Center includes classrooms which will host programs from local learning institutions. It is a part of the Contra Costa County Library system. The Glenn Seaborg Learning Consortium, named after chemist Glenn Seaborg, aims to provide materials, archives, workshops, exhibits, K-12 curricula, lectures, films, and discovery centers from many local institutions such as the UC System, Lawrence Hall of Science, Oakland Museum of California, Chabot Space and Science Center, Commonwealth Club of California, Oakland Zoo in Knowland Park, John Muir Health, Lindsay Wildlife Museum, California Shakespeare Theater, Greenbelt Alliance, John F. Kennedy University, St. Mary’s College, and the UC Institute of Governmental Studies. The mission statement says that the center aims to be a cultural and learning center throughout the community, expanding upon the usual role of a library. History The Lafayette Library and Learning Center was first proposed to the City of Lafayette at the end of 2003. The city voted to support the Library in January 2004. In 2004 the membership of the Glenn Seaborg Learning Consortium was finalized and funding was pursued. In November 2004 the project was awarded $11.9M by the State of California. In 2004–2005 City officials brokered a deal with the local veterans to build a new Veterans Memorial Building at the west end of Lafayette and to take over the former Veterans Memorial Building in the downtown area for use by the new Library. The new Veterans Memorial Building was completed late in 2005. Meanwhile, community donations were raised which matched the State grant of $11.9M. Construction bids were gathered and the ground breaking for the new Library occurred on April 20, 2007. During this period Seaborg Consortium programming began using the existing library space and the new Lafayette Veterans Memorial Building. On November 14, 2009, the doors of the Lafayette Library and Learning Center opened for the first time. Since that day in November, the LLLC has hosted over 400 programs annually. Topics ranged from Story Times, to the life of a bug, to the historic 2008 Presidential campaign as related by New York Times bestselling author Mark Halperin. Nearly 1,500 visitors pass through the front doors of the Library every day – a 300% increase from daily attendance at the old library.

The show aired for twelve seasons on Sveriges Television (SVT), between 2005 and 2019. Ola Lindholm was the host of the show for the first four seasons but was then replaced with Rickard Olsson. The second season was filmed in late 2006 and aired in early 2007. The show took a one-year break before returning in 2009. Except for 2006, 2008 and 2011, the show has been aired every year since its inaugural season. Carolina Klüft took over the role as host in 2019. SVT then dropped off the rights for the show. For 2020, the 13th season, TV4 has taken over the rights for the show, leading to Linda Lindorff taking over the hosting role. Described as a children's version of Survivor, the show features two teams of children (\\"Björnarna\\" and \\"Lejonen\\") competing with each other in competitions in the Swedish forest Kolmården, where they live together until the show is over and the winners of the final win a trip to Africa. Unlike Survivor, however, a new contestant joins the competition every week and no one gets sent home. The new contestant joins the team that won that week's competition. The goal is to have as many contestants as possible in one's team as it will give the team an advantage in competitions and eventually the final. Wild Kids won the Kristallen television award in 2007 for \\"Children's Show of the Year\\". The show has been considered a ratings success for SVT, and the episodes of the show's second season were viewed by approximately 625,000–700,000 people. In 2007, new episodes of Wild Kids received 200,000–300,000 views every week on SVT's online channel SVT Play, making it the channel's second most popular television show of the year. Around 10,000 Swedish children (ages 11–13) apply every year for one of the fourteen spots available on the show. During one episode, a contestant saw her father choosing a new car over spending time with her. The girl burst into tears and although she got to see her father soon afterwards, the scene was heavily criticized by the Swedish media for treating the children too harshly. Lindholm defended the show by saying that the girl stopped crying quickly and the scene was heavily edited to make it seem worse than it actually was. In 2011, an experimental reality show, Tittarnas Wild Kids (\\"The Viewers' Wild Kids\\"), aired for one season on SVT. The plot of the show was to let children from all of Sweden send a video where they carried out tasks to show knowledge within construction, animal spying, courage, nature, collaboration, strength and survival. Of the sent-in contributions, in each episode three finalists were chosen to go to Furuviksparken and carry out a real Wild Kids challenge. Ten episodes were produced, however the final two episodes were never broadcast since the show's presenter, Ola Lindholm, got prosecuted (and later convicted) of narcotic misuse.

Largely self-taught, he was apprenticed to a cabinet-maker but soon abandoned his trade in favour of teaching and writing. He practised as an architect but is best remembered for his theoretical work on the skew arch (he never actually constructed one himself), his invention of draughtsman's instruments, including a centrolinead and a cyclograph, and his prolific writing on numerous practical subjects. Biography Early life Born in 1765 in the parish of Prestonkirk, East Lothian, Peter Nicholson was the son of a stonemason. Largely self-taught and excelling in the field of mathematics, he received only a rudimentary formal education, studying under a Mr Richardson, brother of architect George Richardson, at the local parish school from the age of nine until he left, aged 12, to assist his father in the family business. During this time he amused himself by making drawings and models of the numerous mills in the neighbourhood. However, finding stonemasonry not to his liking, he expressed the desire to be a cabinet-maker and so served a four-year apprenticeship at Linton, the principal village in the parish, then worked as a journeyman in Edinburgh before leaving for London in 1789 at the age of 24.

He published his first book, The Carpenter's New Guide in 1792, illustrating it with plates engraved by his own hand. It is notable for containing an original method for the construction of groins and niches of complex, double curved forms. Whilst living in London, Nicholson published three more books, The Student's Instructor (1795), The Carpenter and Joiner's Assistant (1797), and a three-volume work entitled Principles of Architecture, which he began in 1794 but did not complete until 1798. Middle years After living in London for 11 years, Nicholson returned to Scotland in 1800, at the age of 35, and spent the next eight years working as an architect in Glasgow, a city already rising to eminence, and to which he made a number of contributions, including a wooden bridge over the River Clyde, Carlton Place in Laurieston, and additions to the College buildings. During this time Hugh Montgomerie, the 12th Earl of Eglinton commissioned him to prepare plans for the new town of Ardrossan in Ayrshire and for the next 50 years his simple but effective grid plan was adhered to. The town's harbour was built under the direction of fellow Scot and celebrated engineer, Thomas Telford who was sufficiently impressed by Nicholson's work that he recommended him for the post of Surveyor to the county of Cumberland, on the death of the incumbent, John Chisholme in 1808. Successfully securing the post, Nicholson relocated to Carlisle, where he supervised the construction of the new Courts of Justice to Telford's designs and received rewards from the Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts for improvements he made to the construction of handrailing and for his invention of a draughtsman's instrument called the centrolinead, before returning to London two years later, in order to resume his teaching and writing. Establishing a school in Oxford Street, Nicholson taught mathematics, architecture, surveying and building technology, and he continued to develop the centrolinead, in recognition of which he received the Gold Isis Medal and the sum of 20 shillings from the Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts in 1814, and a silver medal in 1815. In c. 1816 he sat for portrait artist James Green, the painting being donated to the National Portrait Gallery in London in 1961. The period between 1810 and 1829, during which Nicholson lived in London, was his most prolific as an author. During this time he published Mechanical Exercises (1812), The Builder and Workman's New Director (1822), and The Architectural Dictionary, in two volumes (1812 and 1819). This work was considered the most important of the numerous works that were to make his reputation as a national authority on building technology at a time when the building industry was changing rapidly under the influence of scientific research. In addition to practical books relating to building and architecture, Nicholson also wrote about purely scientific, and sometimes rather esoteric subjects. His Treatise on Practical Perspective (1815) included a discussion and full instructions on the use of the centrolinead, while his mathematical works included such titles as An Introduction to the Method of Increments (1817), Essays on the Combinatorial Analysis (1818), and The Rudiments of Algebra (1819). His Essay on Involution and Evolution (1820) earned him the commendation of the Académie des Sciences in Paris. In 1826, at the age of 61, Nicholson visited France and, by the time of his return, had gained sufficient familiarity with the language to be able to translate books on various mathematical subjects. The following year, he began work on an ambitious project entitled The School of Architecture and Engineering, intending to complete it in 12 affordable volumes, costing just 1s 6d each, but he was forced to abandon the work when the publisher, J. and C. Adlard of LondonT., 1844, (Laxton, ed.), op. cit., p. 427. was declared bankrupt and only five volumes were ever produced, this being the only project he left unfinished. Suffering a heavy financial loss himself, and in order to economise, Nicholson left London for Morpeth in Northumberland in 1829, where he lived in a small property left to him by a relative. In the meantime, he published A Popular and Practical Treatise on Masonry and Stone-cutting (1828), in which he solved the problem of cutting stones to the precise shapes required for the construction of a strong skew arch and presented his solution in a form that was useful to other engineers and stonemasons, enabling the stones to be prepared from templates at the quarry in advance of the actual construction of the bridge. Later life In Morpeth, Nicholson started work on a book entitled A Treatise on Dialing in which he described how to prepare and erect sundials, as well as applying trigonometry to the problem of finding the length of the hip of a roof and its rafters from the angle of inclination of its eaves. On 10 August 1832, Nicholson's wife, Jane died, aged 48, and he erected a neat memorial to her in the grounds of the High Church before leaving Morpeth and taking up residence in Carliol Street, Newcastle upon Tyne. At the age of 67, and still financially embarrassed, Nicholson resumed his writing, finally getting his Treatise on Dialing published in Newcastle in 1833, and set up a school in the recently opened Royal Arcade, which he ran for a few years, though it was not a financial success. He was nevertheless highly regarded by the local people and was awarded honorary memberships of a number of local institutions, including the Newcastle Mechanics' Institute. In 1834, an attempt was made to raise, by public subscription, sufficient funds to purchase an annuity for his benefit, but as only £320 was raised it was deemed insufficient for the purpose and was handed directly to Nicholson to help with his immediate needs, and a petition was sent to the king in an attempt to secure a pension for him from the Privy Purse. In October 1836, he was elected President of the Newcastle Society for the Promotion of the Fine Arts and in August 1838, he presented a paper entitled Principles of Oblique Bridges to the eighth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which was held in Newcastle. During the nine years he lived in Newcastle, Nicholson published three more books, his Treatise on Projection (1837) containing his portrait, drawn from life by Edward Train, originally in pen and ink. Nicholson's final work was entitled The Guide to Railway Masonry, containing a Complete Treatise on the Oblique Arch and published on 1 January 1839, the third edition of which also contained the portrait by Train. The contrast between this and the earlier portrait by Green is marked: Green painted a man at the peak of his vigour, while Train drew a much older and poorer man. Leaving Newcastle for Carlisle on 10 October 1841, aged 76, Nicholson was supported for the remainder of his life by the generosity of Thomas Jamieson, a relative by marriage, of Newton, Northumberland. He died on 18 June 1844 and was buried in the graveyard of Christ Church, which was built in 1830 but has since been demolished. A monument to his memory, designed by Robert William Billings in the form of a pair of interpenetrating obelisks, was erected in Carlisle cemetery in 1865. Nicholson married twice. By his first wife, Jane he had one son, Michael Angelo, author of the Carpenter and Joiner's Companion (1826), who died in 1842, leaving a numerous family; by his second marriage, Nicholson had a daughter, Jessie, who married a Mr Bowen of Bridgewater, and a son, Jamieson T., both of whom survived him. Recognition, criticism and legacy As a mathematician Nicholson is variously described in his own books as architect, carpenter, surveyor, practical builder and private teacher of mathematics. As a mathematician, he was largely self-taught, later turning to architecture as a means of finding a practical application for the theoretical knowledge he had amassed during his solitary studies. For his work on involution and evolution, Nicholson received the following commendation from the French Académie des Sciences. As an architect Although almost entirely forgotten as a mathematician, Nicholson is still remembered as an architect and in the 1978 edition of his standard work, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840, Howard M. Colvin claims that Colvin continues, On the skew arch Kielder Viaduct, information plaque For his work on the skew arch Nicholson received a number of letters of thanks from contractors, engineers and masons, which he published in a Testimonials section of his Guide to Railway Masonry. Kielder Viaduct, a seven arch skew railway bridge built to his pattern, now disused but preserved by the Northumberland and Newcastle Society, carries an information plaque commemorating Nicholson's pioneering work in this field. Following his 1836 publication On the Construction of Skew Arches, Charles Fox openly acknowledged Nicholson's contribution while claiming his own to be the superior method. In his 1837 publication A Practical and Theoretical Essay on Oblique Bridges, George W. Buck also acknowledged Nicholson's contribution but, finding it lacking in detail, applied his own original trigonometrical approach and considerable practical experience to the problem. The unfavourable comments from Fox and Buck were comparatively mild and tempered in part by their acknowledgement of Nicholson's pioneering work. Nevertheless, Nicholson, by this time in his mid-70s and his health failing, felt the need to exercise his right of reply. A number of people expressed their public support for him, including his friend Henry Welch, the County Bridge Surveyor for Northumberland and an anonymous supporter known only by the initials M.Q. Unfortunately this exchange escalated into a paper war that became increasingly acrimonious, culminating in 1840 in a very personal attack by Buck's assistant, the 28-year-old William Henry Barlow, and causing Nicholson considerable distress.T., 1844, (Laxton, ed.), op. cit., p. 426. By his fellow citizens A measure of the high esteem in which Nicholson was held by the residents of Newcastle and their sense of injustice at his financial plight can be gauged from the petition sent to the king in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a pension on his behalf.

Tractor hauling wagons on Yukon Highway near Goldstream. 1928 Wilds P. Richardson, first president of the ARC (1905–1917) Roads, trails, telegraph lines and railways of Alaska, circa 1920 The Board of Road Commissioners for Alaska, more commonly known as the Alaska Road Commission or ARC, was created in 1905 as a board of the U.S. War Department. It was responsible for the construction and improvement of many important Alaska highways, such as the Richardson Highway, Steese Highway, Elliot Highway and Edgerton Highway, among others. The commission was transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1932, and was absorbed by the Bureau of Public Roads, a division of the Commerce Department in 1956. Today, responsibility for road development and maintenance in Alaska lies with the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities.  Background and Motivation  The Alaska Interior was largely roadless up until about the 1870s, with only a network of trails established by the native people of Alaska, which Russian, and later American, traders and prospectors used as well. The Russians in Alaska stuck to coastal regions, and built almost no new trails or roads during their time of possession (1741 to 1867), and early mining, such as near Sitka was close to the coast. In the 1870s and 1880s, spurred by increased settlement and prospecting, some settlers began making arrangements with the natives, improving trails and in some cases imposing tolls, such as on the Dalton Trail. Prospectors and others wished for an easier overland route between a year-round port in southern Alaska and the Yukon River. The US Army began surveying and determined the best route would be north from Valdez. The Army started construction of a pack trail from Valdez to Eagle in 1898. By 1899 this project was also known as the Trans- Alaska Military Road. In the early 1900s congressional committees investigating transportation needs in Alaska, including a 1903 visit by a Senate committee on Territories, recommended that the War Department construct a trail system and upgrade the newly built Valdez-Eagle trail to a wagon road. Congress approved legislation establishing a commission to oversee these and other improvements on January 27, 1905, and the Board of Road Commissioners for Alaska, generally referred to as the Alaska Road Commission (ARC), was organized May 15, 1905, by order of the Secretary of War.  Structure and operations  The ARC had three members, as follows; The chairman or president of the board, in overall charge of operations, an engineer officer with fieldwork responsibility, and a secretary and disbursing officer who ran the office proper and paid for work executed. The Department of War at the time was in charge of the US Army and many of the board members were US Army officers, including the first chairman, Brigadier General Wilds P. Richardson. Initially, the board reported directly to the War Department through the Army Adjutant General but on December 29, 1917, supervision was transferred to the Chief of Engineers, the head of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Funding for commission operations was initially intended to come from 70 percent of the business license fees (Federal vocational and trade license taxes) from areas outside incorporated towns. However this funding source was sporadic and insufficient so it was supplemented with general congressional appropriations, with yearly appropriations initially running between $100,000 and $500,000. There was also a special tax imposed on residents of unincorporated areas of 2 days labor at road building, or 8 USD cash to fund construction. In 1912, after Alaska became a territory this was revised to $4 but was levied against all Alaska residents. This resulted in a mix of about 60–70% congressional appropriation and 30–40% territorial funding. In 1914 the Territorial Legislature set up road districts with elected road commissioners but this did not last. Shortly thereafter, in 1917, the Territorial Legislature set up a Territorial Board of Road Commissioners and 4 regional boards. These boards tended to approve projects and give funding to the ARC to carry them out, and the head of the territorial boards were sometimes the superintendents of the relevant ARC district, and the chairman of the Territorial Board was often the chairman of the ARC. From its formation, the ARC also had subcontracted responsibility from the Department of Agriculture for road maintenance in the Tongass and Chugach national forests, but in 1922 this was transferred to the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Public Roads, which then took on construction of roads and trails in the forests.  Scope of work  The ARC got busy quickly, by 1907 the commission had flagged of winter trails on the Seward Peninsula, built of road, upgraded 200 miles of existing trails, and cleared of new trail. A significant project was construction of a spur trail from Gulkana on the Valdez-Eagle route to the new mining camp of Fairbanks. By 1922 these numbers had grown to of wagon road including of gravel surfaced roads, of winter sled roads, of permanent trail and of temporary flagged trail. By 1932 the ARC had built and maintained of roads, of tram road, of sled roads, of trails, of temporary flagged trails, 26 airfields, and 32 shelter cabins. Total expenditures were in excess of $18 million. The ARC did not favor use of these trails by trucks or automobiles, declaring in 1914 that it made \\"no pretense of having built roads adapted for automobile travel\\", nevertheless by 1922 90% of the summer traffic was with motorized vehicles. Typical initial construction standards were width for light traffic trails and for heavier traffic trails, usually just graded through the countryside. In permafrost areas corduroy road construction techniques were used. Small streams were bridged with culverts. Initially larger streams were forded or had ferries provided (such as the ferry across the Tanana at Rika's Landing), but as time and funds permitted, larger bridging projects were carried out, such as the bridge across the Tazlina River, and the bridge across the Tonsina River.  Following Years  Vehicle being towed out of the mud, 1939, Alaska Route 51, mile 16 (shows problematic roads) The ARC built many shelter cabins, such as this one, Igloo Creek Cabin No. 25 now in Denali National Park and Preserve In 1932 the Alaska Road Commission was transferred to the Department of the Interior. The Interior Department imposed registration and license fee requirements on all vehicles in Alaska, which many vehicle operators ignored. In addition, a toll was collected from commercial vehicles on the Richardson Highway. The Interior Department also operated the Alaska Railroad, and in a controversial bid to move traffic to the railroad, the tolls were increased to between $100 and $175. The commercial freighters did not like this toll and evaded it by various means. By 1940, a pirate ferry (complete with skull and crossbones flag) was operating at Big Delta, Alaska, at the Tanana River crossing, with incidents such as seizing the local Deputy Marshal resulting. The government was unable to enforce the law, with at least one grand jury in Fairbanks refusing to return indictments, finding the tax discriminatory. Finally in 1942, Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes repealed the toll. The ARC remained with the Department of the Interior until 1956 when it was absorbed by the Bureau of Public Roads, then a division of the Commerce Department. which later evolved into the Federal Highway Administration. The ARC operated as usual, federally managed, until 1960. With the advent of statehood in 1959 the State of Alaska assumed road building and maintenance responsibility, but contracted to the ARC for the work. However, in 1960, the state ended the agreement with the Bureau of Public Roads, and the ARC was transferred to the state, becoming the Alaska State Highway Department.  Legacy  The ARC left a lasting mark on the development of Alaska. Many of Alaska's most important and historic highways are named for Road Commission officers instrumental in their construction, including * Richardson Highway, named for Brigadier General Wilds P. Richardson * Steese Highway, named for Colonel James G. Steese * Elliott Highway, named for Major Malcolm Elliott * Edgerton Highway, named for Major General Glen E. Edgerton * Taylor Highway, named for ARC President (1932–1948) Ike P. Taylor In addition signs of the work of the ARC can still be seen, for example some of the shelter cabins built by the ARC during the construction of the Denali Park Road are still in use as ranger patrol cabins by National Park Service rangers in Denali National Park and Preserve.

Conservation biologists have designed a variety of objective means to measure biodiversity empirically. Each measure of biodiversity relates to a particular use of the data. For practical conservationists, measurements should include . For others, a more economically defensible definition should allow the ensuring of continued possibilities for both adaptation and future use by humans, assuring environmental sustainability. As a consequence, biologists argue that this measure is likely to be associated with the variety of genes. Since it cannot always be said which genes are more likely to prove beneficial, the best choice for conservation is to assure the persistence of as many genes as possible. For ecologists, this latter approach is sometimes considered too restrictive, as it prohibits ecological succession.  Taxonomic Diversity  Biodiversity is usually plotted as taxonomic richness of a geographic area, with some reference to a temporal scale. WhittakerWhittaker, R.H., Evolution and measurement of species diversity, Taxon, 21, 213–251 (1972) described three common metrics used to measure species-level biodiversity, encompassing attention to species richness or species evenness: * Species richness - the simplest of the indices available. * Simpson index * Shannon-Wiener index Recently, another new index has been invented called the Mean Species Abundance Index (MSA); this index calculates the trend in population size of a cross section of the species. It does this in line with the CBD 2010 indicator for species abundance.  Other Measures of Diversity  Alternatively, other types of diversity may be plotted against a temporal timescale: * species diversity * ecological diversity * morphological diversity * genetic diversity These different types of diversity may not be independent. There is, for example, a close link between vertebrate taxonomic and ecological diversity. Other authors tried to organize the measurements of biodiversity in the following way:Cianciaruso, M.V., Silva, I.A. & Batalha, M.A. Diversidades filogenética e funcional: novas abordagens para a Ecologia de comunidades. Biota Neotrop. 9(3): . * traditional diversity measures ** species density, take into account the number of species in an area ** species richness, take into account the number of species per individuals (usually [species]/[individuals x area]) ** diversity indices, take into account the number of species (the richness) and their relative contribution (the evenness); e.g.: *** Simpson index *** Shannon-Wiener index * phylogenetic diversity measures, include information on phylogenetic relationships among species ** phylogenetic diversity (PD) index; Faith (1992) ** topology based measures *** taxonomic distinctiveness; Vane-Wright et al. (1991) *** taxonomic diversity; Warwick & Clarke (1995) *** taxonomic distinctness; Clarke & Warwick (1998) * functional diversity measures, include information on functional traits among species ** categoric measures *** functional group richness (FGR); e.g., Tilman et al. (1997) ** continuous measures *** with only one functional trait; e.g., Mason et al. (2003) *** multivariate measures, with many functional traits **** functional attribute diversity (FAD); Walker et al. (1999) **** convex hull volume; Cornwell et al. (2006) **** functional diversity (FD); Petchey & Gaston (2002)  Scale  Diversity may be measured at different scales. These are three indices used by ecologists: * Alpha diversity refers to diversity within a particular area, community or ecosystem, and is measured by counting the number of taxa within the ecosystem (usually species) * Beta diversity is species diversity between ecosystems; this involves comparing the number of taxa that are unique to each of the ecosystems. * Gamma diversity is a measurement of the overall diversity for different ecosystems within a region.

Biography Konstantin Ivanov was born in Stara Zagora in 1879. His father was a local revolutionary worker. He studied in the Plovdiv Gymnasium, where he was influenced by the representative of the Geneve group, Dimo Nikolov, to accept the socialist ideas. He went to Lyubimets with Nikolov to get acquainted with the conditions in the Odrin Vilayet. There he met Pavel Genadiev, who attracted him to the revolutionary cause. Genadiev managed to appoint Ivanov teacher in Aharkyoy, Odrin region. He became a member of the Odrin regional revolutionary committee of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) and founded committees in Aharkyoy and the neighbouring villages – , Dogandzha, Kaikkyoy, Haskyoy, Fikel, Vazgash, Hadzhikyoy and others. However, Konstantin Antonov was forced to escape to Odrin and later to Bulgaria because of betrayal which happened in the village of Kemal. From February 1901 to 1902, he was a leader of the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee (SMAC) border point in Chepelare, where he was supported by the local teacher Tota Doncheva. There he started using the name Valcho, in memory of the previous leader of the border point, Valcho Sarafov, who was a cousin of Boris Sarafov. In Chepelare, Antonov applied unscrupulous methods of terror as a result of which a few members of the organization were killed, and many other members suffered from betrayal. The revolutionary cause was in general seriously shaken. According to Hristo Karamandzhukov: On the Plovdiv Congress of the Odrin revolutionary region in 1902, he was chosen a traveling member of the Odrin regional revolutionary committee and he was appointed leader of the West Thrace revolutionary region. The same year in August, he created a revolutionary band in Haskovo, in which were included Tane Nikolov, Dimitar Zapryanov, Stefan Cholakov, Dyado Petar and others, and entered Thrace with this band. In 1904, he went to Odessa, where he established close relations with the local socialists. In 1904 he married Tota Doncheva and in the beginning of 1905 he went with her to Skopje, where they formed a socialist group under the mask of their tailoring activity. However, they were revealed to the authorities and expelled outside the borders of the Ottoman Empire. During the Balkan Wars, he was a volunteer of the Macedonian- Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps and served in the revolutionary band of Nikola Zhekoolu, and later in the Third company of the Third Thessalonica Battalion.„Македоно-одринското опълчение 1912-1913 г.

On 21 June 1578, Flower issued a printed proclamation as Norroy Herald and King of Heralds for the Province of Trent, North East and Westward. This asserted that his deputy, the heraldic painter Peter Proby of West Chester would license heraldic painting and take fees, particularly for the arms painted on funeral equipment. Flower declared; > \\"I give my straight commandment to all Painters, Glaziers, Goldsmiths, > Gravers, or any other that doth or hereafter shall use the arte of painting, > that they nor any of them shall not from this present date exercise nor use > any painting in any wise, appertaining to the office of armes, especially > for Escutchons of armes, or banners, standards, pennons, hatchments, helms, > crests, or any thing or thinges appertayning to funeralls of any personages, > within my sayd province ..., without my special licence, or at least being > licensed and sett on worke at such funeralls by my sayd Deputie Peter > Proby.\\"Flower, William, By the king of Hearolds of this province, from the > river of Trent, North East and Westward, (1578), modernized here, > (Broadsheet, STC (2nd ed.) / 11108, on-line via EEBO from Bodleian Library) Arms See also * Heraldry Notes References    * External links * A grant of arms and crest by letters patent of William Flower, Norroy King of Arms to Leonard Wray, of Ardwike, Yorkshire, dated 21 May 1587 Visitations  * Category:1490s births Category:1588 deaths Category:English officers of arms Category:Military personnel from Yorkshire Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:People from York Category:16th- century English people ","title":"William Flower (officer of arms)"},{"id":"24159398","text":"Banjosa Lake () is an artificial lake and a tourist resort from the city of Rawalakot in Poonch District of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan.

While first a vassal ruler under the Majapahit kings, he later emerged as the king of a separate island realm. He was also known under the names Sri Smara Kepakisan or Tegal Besung. Dewa Tegal Besung is the earliest deified ruler who is honoured at the Pura Padharman Dalem Gelgel, the most important shrine at the central Balinese temple Pura Besakih.David Stuart-Fox, Pura Besakih; Temple, religion and society in Bali. Leiden: KITLV Press 2002, p. 118. Shift of royal seat According to the 18th-century chronicle Babad Dalem, Dalem Ketut was the youngest son of the immigrant Javanese Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan, who was established as Majapahit vassal after the Javanese conquest of Bali in 1343. When his father died he was succeeded in his palace in Samprangan by his eldest son Dalem Samprangan, while Ketut spent his time as a gambler. Since Dalem Samprangan quickly proved incompetent to rule, Ketut was persuaded to take royal titles and establish a new palace (puri) in Gelgel, close to the south coast. The old Samprangan palace lapsed into obscurity, while the power and prestige of Gelgel rose. The late text Babad Bhumi alleges that he was established in Bali in the Saka year 1378 (AD 1456).Candrasangkala , p. 62. However, a charter from Badung mentions another lord, a sang adipati (Majapahit regent) called Sang Arya Gajah Wengker who received tributes from drylands and taxes from the sawah fields in the year 1468.V.E, Korn, Het adatrecht van Bali. 's-Gravenhage: Naeff 1932, p. 25. Reign The Babad Dalem chronicle relates that Dalem Ketut twice visited Majapahit, at the first occasion meeting the king Hayam Wuruk (1350–1389).W.A. Hanna, Bali Chronicles, Singapore: Periplus 2004, p. 25. The account is anachronistic, since it is also asserted that Dalem Ketut was alive at the time when Majapahit collapsed, an event historically dated in the early 16th century. Through this event, Bali remained as a daughter kingdom of Majapahit, a condition which still has a deep symbolic significance for the self-perception of the Balinese. At the end of his life Dalem Ketut was visited by a Brahmin from Kling (India) who recognized the face of the king as the same as the countenance of Mahadewa, the God of the mountain Gunung Agung. The priest prophesied the death of Dalem Ketut, which occurred in a supernatural way; the king disappeared without leaving a trace.C.C. Berg, De middeljavaansche historische traditië. Santpoort: Mees 1927, pp. 123-9. Family and succession Dalem Ketut left six sons: * Dalem Baturenggong * Dewa Gedong Arta * Dewa Nusa * Dewa Anggungan, later banished from his caste * Dewa Bangli * Dewa Pagedangan Of these offspring, the last five are mentioned in the Babad Dalem as being sons of Dewa Tegal Besung, whom the scholar C.C. Berg identified with Dalem Ketut, but who is sometimes held to be the ruler's half-brother.Tjokorda Raka Putra, Babad Dalem. Warih Ida Dalem Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan.

Berkeley: Periplus 1989, p. 41. The anachronisms in the traditional accounts makes it difficult to establish the historical status of Dalem Ketut, but if he survived the fall of Majapahit he would have flourished in the early 16th century.Cf.

Its masonry was largely built in the 8th to 11th centuries during the Anglo-Saxon period, making it one of the oldest surviving churches in England. Wing is located 5 km southwest of Leighton Buzzard and 12 km northeast of Aylesbury. The church itself is located on the outskirts west of the town centre. The church was the location of a music video of Libera.Vespera (initially known as Te lucis or Before the Ending; video; solo: Steven Geraghty and Ben Crawley). Youtube, 2006. History The history of Wing dates back to the 7th or 8th century; the place name originally meant \\"The Settlement of Withun's People\\". The first missionaries appeared at the beginning of the second half of the 7th century and the region was Christianized from Aylesbury. The first mention of Wing comes from the period between 966 and 975. The first written mention of the church comes shortly after the Norman Conquest in 1066 and concerned a priest named Goldric, who remained in the possession of the church and his land even after the Norman Conquest.  Anglo-Saxon era  Anglo-Saxon window on the east wall Parts of the church preserved from Anglo-Saxon times are the apse and the underlying crypt, the north wall of the church and the pillars. The crypt and the apse above it come from different periods: The oldest part, three niches and windows in the crypt, are from the eighth century. The apse above dates back to the ninth century and is one of the finest examples of ninth-century architecture and the only fully preserved Anglo-Saxon apse in England. From the Anglo-Saxon period also comes the 10.6 metre high three-nave church with the exception of the outer wall of the southern aisle. The triumphal arch between the apse and the nave probably dates from the time of the first renovation in the 9th century. The only Anglo-Saxon window is in the wall of the eastern gable above the choir.  From the Norman Conquest to the Reformation  Gable above the southern entrance Ceiling in nave After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, oversight of the church was given to the Benedictine monastery of St. Nicholas in Angers, possibly in the hope that they would establish a priory. However, action was limited to the hiring of a sexton to collect revenues. From 1216, the church's revenues were used to pay for the position of a vicar and from that time the church had the status of a parish church. In 1416, as a consequence of the Hundred Years War between England and France, the church passed to the Priory of St. Mary de Pre at St Albans. From the middle of the 13th century until the end of the 15th century, the preservation of the church was the responsibility of the secular Lord of Wing and Ascott, who acted as patron of the church. The church underwent changes in the so-called Decorated Style especially in the first half of the 14th century until the year of plague in 1329. The largest structural changes to the structure of the church took place in the 15th century in the Perpendicular style. The most striking completion of the 15th century was the construction of the massive bell tower, a landmark visible from a great distance. Six bells hang in the tower, four of them dating from the 17th century. They were cast between 1638 and 1654 by the \\"Knight family's bell foundry\\" in Reading. The oak bell chair dates from 1654. From the 14th century come several glass windows, including a coronation of Mary. From 14th and 15th century, respectively, originate the two entrance buildings in the south and north of the church as well as the doorways in them. The doorway in the southern entrance are decorated with coats of arms, lions and other symbols associated with the patron saints of the church. Also from the 15th century is the baptismal font still in use today. The most important work of art left in the church by the 15th century is the wooden ceiling. Below the gable is a series of excellently carved angels with outstretched wings. The edge of the ceiling is decorated by a variety of figures such as kings, queens, musicians and devils.  The church in the post-Reformation period  Tomb of Sir William Dorner The Reformation in England began in about 1530 when Henry VIII separated the English Church from the papacy. Significant for Wing was the abolition of the monasteries, since 1528, the Priory of St. Mary de Pre, to which Wing still belonged, was dissolved. The rights of the Priory were acquired by Robert Dormer, 1st Baron Dormer. The Dormers lived in the Manor of Ascott Hall on the outskirts of Wing, acquired the title Earl of Carnarvon in 1628 and were Wing's most important family until the beginning of the 18th century. Diverse members of the Dormer family are buried in the church, preferably at the eastern end of the northern aisle. Particularly impressive are the tombs for Sir Robert Dormer (died 1552), Sir William Dormer (died 1575) and family and Robert Dormer, 1st Baron Dormer (died 1616) and family. The church is home to a series of 19th century stained glass windows and a Walker organ dating from 1864, placed in 2002 on a new gallery in the base of the tower.

In operator theory, a right ideal \\\\mathfrak{i} in a (possibly) non- unital ring A is said to be regular (or modular) if there exists an element e in A such that ex - x \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{i} for every x \\\\in A. In commutative algebra a regular ideal refers to an ideal containing a non-zero divisor.Non- zero divisors in commutative rings are called regular elements. This article will use \\"regular element ideal\\" to help distinguish this type of ideal. A two-sided ideal \\\\mathfrak{i} of a ring R can also be called a (von Neumann) regular ideal if for each element x of \\\\mathfrak{i} there exists a y in \\\\mathfrak{i} such that xyx=x. Finally, regular ideal has been used to refer to an ideal J of a ring R such that the quotient ring R/J is von Neumann regular ring.Burton, D.M. (1970) A first course in rings and ideals. Addison-Wesley. Reading, Massachusetts . This article will use \\"quotient von Neumann regular\\" to refer to this type of regular ideal. Since the adjective regular has been overloaded, this article adopts the alternative adjectives modular, regular element, von Neumann regular, and quotient von Neumann regular to distinguish between concepts. Properties and examples Modular ideals The notion of modular ideals permits the generalization of various characterizations of ideals in a unital ring to non-unital settings. A two-sided ideal \\\\mathfrak{i} is modular if and only if A/\\\\mathfrak{i} is unital. In a unital ring, every ideal is modular since choosing e=1 works for any right ideal. So, the notion is more interesting for non-unital rings such as Banach algebras. From the definition it is easy to see that an ideal containing a modular ideal is itself modular. Somewhat surprisingly, it is possible to prove that even in rings without identity, a modular right ideal is contained in a maximal right ideal. However, it is possible for a ring without identity to lack modular right ideals entirely. The intersection of all maximal right ideals which are modular is the Jacobson radical. ;Examples * In the non-unital ring of even integers, (6) is regular (e = 4) while (4) is not. * Let M be a simple right A-module. If x is a nonzero element in M, then the annihilator of x is a regular maximal right ideal in A. * If A is a ring without maximal right ideals, then A cannot have even a single modular right ideal. Regular element ideals Every ring with unity has at least one regular element ideal: the trivial ideal R itself. Regular element ideals of commutative rings are essential ideals. In a semiprime right Goldie ring, the converse holds: essential ideals are all regular element ideals. Since the product of two regular elements (=non-zerodivisors) of a commutative ring R is again a regular element, it is apparent that the product of two regular element ideals is again a regular element ideal. Clearly any ideal containing a regular element ideal is again a regular element ideal. ;Examples * In an integral domain, every nonzero element is a regular element, and so every nonzero ideal is a regular element ideal. * The nilradical of a commutative ring is composed entirely of nilpotent elements, and therefore no element can be regular. This gives an example of an ideal which is not a regular element ideal. * In an Artinian ring, each element is either invertible or a zero divisor. Because of this, such a ring only has one regular element ideal: just R. Von Neumann regular ideals From the definition, it is clear that R is a von Neumann regular ring if and only if R is a von Neumann regular ideal. The following statement is a relevant lemma for von Neumann regular ideals: Lemma: For a ring R and proper ideal J containing an element a, there exists and element y in J such that a=aya if and only if there exists an element r in R such that a=ara. Proof: The \\"only if\\" direction is a tautology. For the \\"if\\" direction, we have a=ara=arara. Since a is in J, so is rar, and so by setting y=rar we have the conclusion. As a consequence of this lemma, it is apparent that every ideal of a von Neumann regular ring is a von Neumann regular ideal. Another consequence is that if J and K are two ideals of R such that J⊆K and K is a von Neumann regular ideal, then J is also a von Neumann regular ideal. If J and K are two ideals of R, then K is von Neumann regular if and only if both J is a von Neumann regular ideal and K/J is a von Neumann regular ring. Every ring has at least one von Neumann regular ideal, namely {0}. Furthermore, every ring has a maximal von Neumann regular ideal containing all other von Neumann regular ideals, and this ideal is given by :M=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in R\\\\mid RxR\\\\text{ is a von Neumann regular ideal }\\\\\\\\}. ;Examples * As noted above, every ideal of a von Neumann regular ring is a von Neumann regular ideal. * It is well known that a local ring which is also a von Neumann regular ring is a division ring. Let R Be a local ring which is not a division ring, and denote the unique maximal right ideal by J. Then R cannot be von Neumann regular, but R/J, being a division ring, is a von Neumann regular ring. Consequently, J cannot be a von Neumann regular ideal, even though it is maximal. * A simple domain which is not a division ring has the minimum possible number of von Neumann regular ideals: only the {0} ideal. Quotient von Neumann regular ideals If J and K are quotient von Neumann regular ideals, then so is J∩K. If J⊆K are proper ideals of R and J is quotient von Neumann regular, then so is K. This is because quotients of R/J are all von Neumann regular rings, and an isomorphism theorem for rings establishing that R/K≅(R/J)/(J/K). In particular if A is any ideal in R the ideal A+J is quotient von Neumann regular if J is. ;Examples * Every proper ideal of a von Neumann regular ring is quotient von Neumann regular. * Any maximal ideal in a commutative ring is a quotient von Neumann regular ideal since R/M is a field. This is not true in general because for noncommutative rings R/M may only be a simple ring, and may not be von Neumann regular. * Let R be a local ring which is not a division ring, and with maximal right ideal M . Then M is a quotient von Neumann regular ideal, since R/M is a division ring, but R is not a von Neumann regular ring. * More generally in any semilocal ring the Jacobson radical J is quotient von Neumann regular, since R/J is a semisimple ring, hence a von Neumann regular ring.

Little Chelsea was a hamlet, located on either side of Fulham Road, half a mile Southwest of Chelsea, London. The earliest references to the settlement date from the early 1600s, and the name continued to be used until the hamlet was surrounded by residential developments in the late 1800s. History Evidence of a settlement known by this name appears in the Kensington parish burial record for a child in 1617 and magistrates accounts of an alehouse run by Thomas Freeman in 1625. By the 1670s, the Hearth tax lists 23 buildings, of various size and quality, and the section of Fulham Road that ran through the hamlet was known as 'Little Chelsey streete'. A school was operating in 1703, and, by 1737 there were two public houses in Fulham Road, including the 'Coach and Horses' near Park Walk. In 1811, the area's mixed character remained with: > \\"... weather-boarded cottages, shops, builders' premises and schools in this > part of Fulham Road, but also houses occupied by wealthy retired tradesmen, > rentiers and office-holders, with poplars blowing in their front gardens and > the orchards and nursery-grounds of south-west Brompton behind them.\\" In his memoirs, journalist William Jerdan recalled his time in Little Chelsea in the early 19th century. One of his near neighbours, living 'on a very moderate scale', was the 'exiled Princess of Condé'. The Princess, Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon, lived in a cottage owned by M. Amyot, in 1815-16. Jerdan reports that she often had visits from Marie Thérèse of France, then Duchess of Angoulême, daughter of the executed Louis XVI of France, and he described seeing Marie Thérèse in the street 'dressed little better than a milkmaid, which rank indeed she resembled in her form, and walking about in thick-soled boots'. In 1868, the National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland places 'St. George's workhouse, formerly the residence of the earls of Shaftesbury; Chelsea Park, the Pavilion, and the Goat in Boots inn, the sign of which was originally painted by Moreland' within the bounds of Little Chelsea. Present- day St Andrew's Church in Park Walk, Chelsea, is built on the site of Park Chapel, the local place of worship for Little Chelsea from 1718. Shaftesbury House In 1699, the Earl of Shaftesbury purchased a property known as 'Sir James Smith's House' in Little Chelsea, which was reported to have built by Smith in 1635. Shaftesbury added 50 foot extension into the garden to house his bedchamber and Library. In the garden itself, the Earl planted fruit trees, and 'every kind of vine'. The property was sold to Narcissus Luttrell in 1710. The parish of St George Hanover Square became owners in 1787 and converted the house and grounds into an additional workhouse for their parish poor. Chelsea Park and Chapel In the 1680s, 40 acres of farmland adjoining Fulham Road was enclosed by a wall and became known as Chelsea Park. As land on the Park's western side began to be built on, a dividing roadway was established which was 'lined with elms and called Twopenny Walk' (now Park Walk). In 1718, John Appletree established the Raw Silk Company which paid £200 for a 61-year lease of the Park. A large silkworm nursery was built and 2000 mulberry trees planted. In 1823, the company was able to produce satin for Caroline of Ansbach, Princess of Wales, however, the removal of the tax on imported silk, two years earlier, had led to financial difficulties and the business closed. Raw Silk Company shareholder Richard Manningham took over the lease in 1724, but had some rights to the land in 1718, which allowed him to build Park Chapel, in Twopenny Walk, as a local church for Little Chelsea residents. Manningham's Park Chapel was a simple, single storey building, with a roof turret that housed one bell. In 1810, the Chapel was enlarged to seat a congregation of 1200. By the 1830s, the Chapel had associated subscription schools, in new buildings in its grounds. The National School for boys had 150 pupils and the Chelsea National, for girls, had eighty. The Chapel was renamed Emmanuel in 1906/7 and demolished in 1912. The chapel land, owned by Cyril Sloane Stanley was donated to the parish, and Charles Bannister paid for the construction of a new church on the site, St. Andrew's, which opened in 1913. Four houses in Park Walk, to the north of the new Church, were donated by congregation member Miss Birch, including the present vicarage.

It was demolished in November 1930 to make room for the Moscow Cinema on Abovyan Street. History According to Armenian historian Karo Ghafadaryan, the church of Saint Peter and Paul was the oldest and biggest church in old Yerevan. It was not the only church in old Yerevan. In fact, when in 607 AD the newly elected Catholicos of Armenia Abraham I assembled a meeting at the city of Dvin, he invited clergymen from territories controlled by the Byzantine Empire as well as two priests from Yerevan. Therefore, this tells us that in old Yerevan there were at least two large churches. In the 17th century, French traveler Jean Chardin visited Yerevan. In his description about the city he mentioned that there were numerous churches in old Yerevan, but did not mention a church with the name of \\"Surp Poghos-Petros\\". In 1679, a calamitous earthquake leveled much of the city and destroyed many structures in the neighboring regions. Amongst the structures that lay in ruin was the church of Saint Peter and Paul. A portion of the eastern section of the church survived, and the rest was soon rebuilt from its ruins. The newly reconstructed church went by the same name as its predecessor.Saint Paul and Peter Church in Armenian Holy Apostolic Church, Araratian Patriarchal Diocese There are not any known historical references to the rebuilding of Poghos- Petros Church. Most likely, the church was reconstructed toward the end of the 17th century. Ghafadaryan found the years 1691 and 1692 inscribed upon some of the khachkars built into the church's eastern and northern walls. From two inscriptions Karo Ghafadaryan found that further restoration efforts had taken place again in later years. The first inscription, located upon the arch of the southern façade, tells that the church was restored in 1778. In the second inscription, inscribed onto the northern wall, states that the church was restored in 1820 with the financial assistance of the city's residents.Karo Ghafadaryan, Երևանի միջնադարյան հուշարձանները, վիմական արձանագրությունները ‘‘(Monuments and lapidary inscriptions of Medieval Yerevan)’’, 1975, Yerevan, pp. 159-160 Destruction In November 1930, the Saint Paul and Peter Church was destroyed by the Soviet regime to build Moscow Cinema. Many khachkars and religious structures such as churches, chapels, and shrines were destroyed across the country during this time to eliminate religion. Some fragments of the church's walls and wall-paintings survived. They are now displayed in the Yerevan History Museum and History Museum of Armenia. New church and public controversy On February 25, 2010 the Armenian government approved a proposal to manage Moscow Cinema Ltd. and to acquire the land currently occupied by the cinema's outdoor theater on Abovyan Street in favour of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, for the purpose of building a new church at the site of what was once the church of Poghos-Petros.Old destination, new church: Government approves plan for another house of worship at armenianow.com Project of building a new church in place of outdoor theater of Moskva Cinema The Official Website of the Government of the Republic of Armenia The decision initiated some protests among the public. After the plan was announced, a group named Save Moscow Cinema Open-Air Theater enlisted some 5,000 members and collected over 18,000 signatures during the petition to stop the project. The group addressed Catholicos Karekin II of Armenia as well as the Armenian Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan, calling for a thorough public debate about the proposal and they are still waiting for their replies.Article regarding open-air cinema, armenianow.com Many Armenian architects and intellectuals in have spoken in defense of the open-air theater. More than 60 Armenian intellectuals sent an open letter to Armenian Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan with a request to revise the decision on construction of a church at the place of the open-air cinema hall. The project is seen by some critics as another example of the expanding influence of the Armenian Church into state affairs. In response, representatives of the Armenian Church have accused critics of the construction project of \\"lacking due respect for God\\".Article regarding cinema house, armenianow.com However, the plan was later withdrawn due to the limited space of the location.

Daughter is a 1972 British crime–drama romantic film directed by Harold Becker and adapted by Alan Sillitoe from his short story of the same name. It was Becker's first film during the 1970s and stars Simon Rouse and, in her screen debut, Victoria Tennant. The film tells the story of the ill- fated love between Tony, a petty thief from a working-class family, and Doris, the daughter of an upwardly mobile scrap dealer. Plot Middle-aged Tony Bradmore privately thinks back on his wild youth and his love affair with Doris Randall. Tony's memories are interspersed with scenes from his current life as a cheese factory worker. The young Tony is unemployed and lives with his working-class parents in a poor neighbourhood of crumbling terraces (rowhouses). He commits petty thefts and burglaries partly as a way of getting money and other items he wants, but also partly for the thrill of it. It is implied that his friends engage in similar behaviour and that theft is viewed as a way of getting by in an area perceived to have few economic opportunities. While hanging out with his friends at a local fish and chip shop, he meets the beautiful blonde Doris, whose dress and manner show that she is from a higher social class than Tony, his family and friends. Doris' father, a prosperous scrap merchant, originally came from Tony's neighbourhood, but due to his shrewd and sometimes dishonest business skills, he made enough money to move his family to a large, detached house in a nicer area. As a result of her father's money, Doris has nice clothes and her own horse, does not have to work, and attends an expensive school. Doris' father wants her to carry on his upward mobility by socialising with well-off young people and attending university, but due to her family background, Doris is uncomfortable with these expectations. She is instead drawn to Tony and the \\"kicks\\" they enjoy when spending time together, including riding on Tony's motorcycle and having sex. Doris' father disapproves of Tony, thinking Doris can and should do better, and tries to thwart the relationship. Tony soon falls in love with Doris, and tries to convince her to run away with him, but Doris refuses. Instead, she encourages Tony to commit more burglaries and take her along, even after they are nearly caught in the act. The couple eventually burglarise a shoe shop, during which Doris increases the risk on purpose by turning on lights and encouraging Tony to remain in the shop instead of leaving quickly. The police arrive and pursue Doris and Tony, who initially escape, but Tony in his haste leaves behind evidence that is traced to him. He is arrested and sent to borstal, ending his relationship with Doris. Upon being released, he learns that he had made Doris pregnant, and that she married another man before having the child. Doris and her husband were then killed when the motorcycle they were riding crashed. Doris' parents adopted her son. Denied contact with the child he fathered, Tony steals a radio in broad daylight on a busy street and is quickly apprehended. The middle-aged Tony continues his pattern of theft by stealing cheese from his employer. He takes the cheese home to his working-class wife and young sons, with whom he has a loving relationship. Tony is caught with stolen cheese when police wrongly suspect him of a major bank robbery and search his bag. The police inform Tony's manager at the cheese factory, who sacks Tony but declines to press any charges. Tony's wife, although slightly frustrated, is supportive of him, although he does not let her know that he has been thinking of Doris all day. Tony reassures his wife that he can probably get a new job with the butcher.

Only four were built. Design and development Fw 62 V1 Fw 62 V1 on its beaching gear In 1936 the RLM, the German ministry of aviation, formulated a requirement for a shipboard seaplane for reconnaissance missions, to replace the Heinkel He 114. The aircraft was to be light, with a maximum weight of 2.5 tons and a crew of one or two, and suitable for catapult launching. Equipment and armament were to be kept to a minimum. Focke-Wulf competed with the Fw 62, a conventional biplane design. The Fw 62 was of mixed construction and powered by a 705 kW (945 hp) BMW 132K radial engine. The engine was tightly cowled and drove a two-bladed propeller. The biplane wings were of equal span and featured two N-type struts on each side. They could be folded for shipboard storage. Each wing had a plain flap and an aileron. Operational history First flown on 23 October 1937 the Fw 62 V1 twin floats, while the Fw 62 V2 had a large central float and smaller outboard stabilising floats. Official tests began in Travemünde in the summer of 1937. The Fw 62 was a capable aircraft and well liked by test pilots, but the competing Arado Ar 196 monoplane was both conceptually and structurally more modern, and was chosen for production.

He is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Mixed Media Labs. He currently works as a partner at Y Combinator. Biography Born in El Paso, Texas, Caldwell graduated from Stanford University in 2003 with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems and a B.A. in Psychology. After graduation, Caldwell worked briefly for VA Linux (where he had previously worked as a summer intern) before founding imeem in late 2003 with Stanford classmate (and ex- Napster engineer) Jan Jannink. Having raised over $50 million from investors including Sequoia Capital, imeem was one of the world’s largest music streaming services until it was bought and effectively shut down by MySpace. Mixed Media Labs & Picplz Mixed Media Labs, founded in 2010, is a start-up whose first product is picplz, a photo broadcasting application for iPhone and Android mobile devices. The apps let users add effects to their images for free. Current effects include \\"Instant Film,\\" \\"Russian Toy Camera,\\" \\"the 70s\\" and \\"High Contrast Monochrome.” Caldwell says the effects are non-destructive, as picplz uploads both a copy of the original photo as well as the one with the applied filter. Appearance at 2010 Y Combinator’s Startup School In October 2010, Caldwell spoke at Y Combinator’s Startup School event at Stanford University about the failures of imeem and of the challenges still facing the music industry. At the event, Caldwell delivered a cautionary message for entrepreneurs interested in music startups. Caldwell criticized major music labels for holding too much power, focusing mainly on the industry’s licensing deals for content. He said that the current state of the industry made success for startups bleak. While some commentators praised Caldwell for his harsh but realistic insight on the digital music startup industry, many critics (notably David Hyman, CEO and founder of MOG) felt that the lessons learned from Caldwell’s experience with imeem did not accurately portray the industry as a whole.  App.net  Caldwell described a negative experience he had as a Facebook developer, and announced that he was starting a new network, App.net, through Mixed Media Labs. It is designed to be similar to Twitter, but have no advertising, instead relying on user and developer subscriptions. They began directly crowd funding it on July 13, 2012, with a goal of $500,000 and about 10,000 backers. Mixed Media Labs had exceeded the goal by August 13, 2012, raising at least $750,000 with over 11,000 backers.

Claim to the throne He was born at the Batandabezaala Palace, at Mulago, in 1837. He was the son of Kabaka Ssuuna II Kalema Kasinjo, Kabaka of Buganda, who reigned between 1832 and 1856. His mother was Nabakyala Muganzirwazza, the Namasole, one of the 148 recorded wives of his father. He ascended the throne upon the death of his father in October 1856. According to historian MSM Kiwanuka, Muteesa was \\"an insignificant obscure prince\\",Kiwanuka, MM Semakula, Muteesa of Uganda. Kampala: East African Literature Bureau, 1967, pp. 6–9. compared to his brothers Prince Kajumba and Prince Kiyimba. Kajumba was his father's preferred heir, as Suuna frequently pointed out to his chiefs the heroic qualities of the prince. However, the chiefs, led by the Katikkiro Kayiira felt that Kajumba would be difficult to control. Muteesa, an unpopular choice, was chosen ahead of his brothers. He was crowned at Nabulagala. He established his capital, first on Banda Hill. Later he abandoned that palace and established capitals at Nakatema, Nabbingo, Kabojja, and finally at Kasubi, Nabulagala. The capital at Kabojja got its name due to the numerous executions carried out while the king was resident there, as the name echoes something as deadly as a snake bite.Kiwanuka, MM Semakula, 1967 Following his ascension to the throne, Muteesa, with the help of Kayiira, had his rival princes imprisoned on Kisimi Island. Some notable chiefs hatched a plot to overthrow the new king and replace him with Prince Kiyimba. However, the plot was unfoiled and the conspirators, along with Prince Kiyimba and Prince Kajumba, were executed. Married life Muteesa I Mukaabya Walugembe Kayiira is reported to have married 87 wives. Issue He is reported to have fathered 98 children, including: * Kabaka Danieri Basammula-Ekkere Mwanga II Mukasa, Kabaka of Buganda, who reigned from 1884 until 1888 and from 1889 until 1897, whose mother was Naabakyaala Abisaagi Baagal'ayaze. * Kabaka Kiweewa Nnyonyintono, Kabaka of Buganda, who reigned between 11 September 1888 and 21 October 1888, whose mother was Kiribakka. * Kabaka Kalema I Muguluma, Kabaka of Buganda, who reigned from 21 October 1888 until 5 October 1889, whose mother was Ndibuwakanyi. A detailed list of all of Muteesa I's issue is contained at the following reference: His reign Arab and Muslim traders from Zanzibar had been visiting Buganda since the 1840s to trade firearms, gunpowder, salt, and cloth in exchange for ivory and slaves. During Kabaka Muteesa I's reign, these contacts continued. At the same time, contact was made with European visitors for the first time in 1862 when John Speke and James Augustus Grant arrived. Their positive accounts attracted more visitors and Henry Morton Stanley arrived in 1875.Stanley, H.M., 1899, Through the Dark Continent, London: G. Newnes, The Roman Catholics arrived in 1879, in the person of Simon Lourdel Monpel, popularly known as Pere Mapeera, and Brother Amans, of the White Fathers. All three visitor groups were made to believe that Kabaka Muteesa I preferred their religion over the others. They thus wrote favorable reviews back home to their respective governments, encouraging trade and friendly relations. As a result, Buganda, and Uganda were not colonized but were offered status of a protectorate. Some people regard him as the most important of the kings of Buganda because of his vision and diplomatic skills, while others are more critical and believe he welcomed British Imperial influence that ultimately undermined Buganda's sovereignty . The final years He died at Kasubi Nabulagala on 9 October 1884 at the age of 47, and was buried on 18 October 1884 at Kasubi, the first Kabaka to be buried there. In 2007, Muteesa I Royal University was opened in his name, in recognition of his contribution to the education of the people of Buganda and Uganda. The first chancellor of the university was Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II, the current reigning Buganda monarch. In June 2016, Julia Sebutinde was installed as chancellor of the University, replacing Kabaka Mutebi II, who installed her and then became The Visitor of the University. Kabaka Mutebi being Chancellor was making it hard for Regulatory Authorities of the Ugandan Universities system to hold the institution accountable on some issues since being King of the largest ethnic group in the country makes him some one who is sacred.  Quotes about Muteesa I  Under his rule Buganda was never seriously threatened, either with civil war or conquest. He became more powerful and more civilised. He allowed the missionaries to teach that it was possible to owe a higher allegiance than to their King, and while he lived their lives were safe. He had the strengths and subtlety to balance the Catholics, Protestants, Muslims and pagans, so that he controlled them all, just as he kept in touch with the rest of the world, but managed not to be swamped by it. If he turned inward at the end it was but a mild taste of what was to come. * Kabaka Mutesa II, Desecration of My Kingdom (1967) Succession table See also * Banda Hill * Kabaka of Buganda * Muteesa I Royal University * Mapeera House References Further reading *Kaggwa, Sir Apollo K, Basekabaka be’Buganda [translated by MM Semakula Kiwanuka].

When it was active it accommodated smaller commuter airliners such as the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprop which had STOL (\\"Short Take Off and Landing\\") capabilities and could operate from airfields with short runways with such airports being known as STOLports. It is no longer registered as an active airport by the FAA, ICAO and IATA and serves Walt Disney World as a parking and storage lot. History Lake Buena Vista Airport was built in 1971 to serve as a STOL airfield for Walt Disney World guests and employees, with scheduled passenger airline service to Orlando Jetport at McCoy (now Orlando International Airport, MCO) and Tampa International Airport (TPA) provided by Shawnee Airlines, using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft which were STOL capable. This Shawnee Airlines service is mentioned in the \\"Air Commuter Service\\" section of the Sept. 6, 1972 Eastern Air Lines system timetable as a connecting service to and from Eastern flights at Orlando and Tampa. Another commuter air carrier which operated scheduled DHC-6 Twin Otter passenger service into the airport was Executive Airlines. The airport was never large, with only enough ramp space at the passenger terminal to accommodate four aircraft at a time; no hangar space was ever built. This STOL airfield was intended as a proof-of-concept for a planned, but was ultimately rejected in favor of a vision for a larger, full-service airport within Walt Disney World itself. All passenger service was discontinued by the 1980s, largely due to extensions of the Walt Disney World Monorail System on either side. As of 2009, flight operations are prohibited by a no-fly zone in place since 2003; however, the runway is fully intact and may be visible to motorists traveling along World Drive toward the Transportation and Ticket Center, as well as by passengers on the monorail. Service There has been no scheduled or unscheduled commercial service to this airport since the early 1980s. The next nearest airport, Kissimmee Gateway Airport, briefly offered passenger service through the now defunct DayJet; currently, most Walt Disney World guests arrive through Orlando International Airport and Orlando Sanford International Airport.  \\"The Singing Airport\\"  Originally used to surprise the airplane passengers, the runway featured a set of grooves, like those on the side of a highway, that played \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" when driven over at roughly 45 miles per hour.

In the same year, Bentham described a new species, D. penicillaris, which Ludwig Diels reduced to a variety under D. menziesii in 1906. N. G. Marchant and Allen Lowrie later moved var. penicillaris to a subspecies of D. menziesii in 1992. Ludwig Diels also described a new species, D. thysanosepala in 1906, which N. G. Marchant reduced to a subspecies of D. menziesii in 1982. Lastly, Marchant and Lowrie described subspecies basifolia in 1992, which they note is distinguished by the dense cluster of basal, alternate cauline leaves on the lower part of the stem.Schlauer, J. 2009.

Entered combat from England in March 1944 with fighter sweeps over the Bayeux-Saint-Aubin area of France. Participated in attacks on targets in France, Belgium, and Germany in preparation for the invasion of the Continent. Flew fighter sweeps over Normandy on 6 June 1944; targets included motor vehicle convoys, buildings, and gun emplacements. Moved to the Continent soon after D-Day. Received a DUC for three missions flown in support of ground forces on 11 July 1944: on a mission to destroy pillboxes near St. Lo, Normandy, France, discovered and destroyed portion of an enemy tank column unknown to Allied infantry; after rearming, the group returned to attack the tank column and prevented the enemy from accomplishing their mission. During the third mission, despite heavy rainfall, successfully attacked another Panzer battalion from minimum altitude. Group also supported Allied ground forces during the breakthrough at St. Lo in July 1944. In August 1944 attacked tanks, trucks, and troop concentrations as enemy retreated; provided armed reconnaissance for advancing Allied armored columns. During September 1944, attacked flak positions near Eindhoven during airborne landing in the Netherlands; bombed enemy communications and transportation lines in western Germany. Flew armed reconnaissance missions over Battle of the Bulge during December 1944 – January 1945; group flew 600 sorties from 17–27 December 1944 that resulted in the destruction of 43 enemy aircraft, 37 tanks, 328 trucks, 18 armored vehicles, four gun positions, and 15 half-tracks. Provided cover for VII Corps in January 1945 and during action destroyed over 1,000 enemy vehicles. Flew missions against enemy transportation systems including motor vehicles, bridges, trains, railway bridges, and marshalling yards during February and March 1945. Moved to Germany in April 1945. On group's last mission of the war, attacked harbors at Kiel and Flensbury on 3 May 1945. Served in occupational status in Germany from May 1945 until group inactivated. Cold War Emblem of the 366th Fighter-Bomber Group The group was reactivated on 1 January 1953 at Alexandria Air Force Base, Louisiana. It replaced the Federalized Iowa Air National Guard 132d Fighter Bomber Group which was being returned to state control after a twenty-one-month period of activation as a result of the Korean War. The group was composed of the 389th, 390th, and 391st Fighter Squadrons. Initially using the former ANG F-51D Mustangs, the 366th received F-86F Sabres which were returned from Korea in the summer of 1953, then received new swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreaks in early 1954. On 18 March 1954, the KB-29 equipped 420th Air Refueling Squadron was attached to the Wing to provide air refueling for the Thunderstreaks. The B-29s were later replaced with KB-50 aerial tankers. The group's squadrons became first TAC units to perform six-month TDY rotations with NATO at Aviano AB, Italy, with rotations continuing until group inactivated in September 1957 when parent wing adopted Tri-Deputate organization and assigned operational squadrons directly to the wing. Modern era McDonnell Douglas F-15E-49-MC Strike Eagles 90-0233; 90-0246 Upon activation in 1992, assumed control of 366th Wing's operational units. Deployed assets to Southwest Asia throughout the 1990s support to Operation SOUTHERN WATCH; elements participated in Operations PROVIDE COMFORT I and PROVIDE COMFORT II in Turkey. The group's squadrons directly participated in Operations Enduring Freedom and Noble Eagle following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the consolidation of the Air Force's KC-135 and B-1 force led to the reallocation of the unit's bombers and tankers to McConnell AFB, Kansas, and Ellsworth AFB, S.D. The group was also home to F-16CJ Fighter Falcon aircraft from 1992 to March 2007. The F-16CJs left the base in another effort to consolidate from multiple airframes to one at Air Force installations across the country. In 2007, the group became responsible for planning, operations, intelligence, weapons training and airfield services for squadrons assigned to the 366th Wing.

Biography Henry Gabriels was born at Wannegem-Lede, East Flanders. He made his classical studies in St. Mary's College of the neighboring city of Oudenaarde, his philosophy course at the St. Joseph Minor Seminary of Sint-Niklaas, and his theological curriculum for two years in St. Nicholas seminary in Ghent. After entering the University of Louvain, he was ordained to the priesthood on 21 September 1861. He received the degree of Licentiate in Theology from the Louvain in 1864, in the same class of four with John Lancaster Spalding, the first Bishop of Peoria, Illinois. It was at this time that Bishop John McCloskey, on behalf of the Province of New York City, was asking Bishop Louis-Joseph Delebecque of Ghent for some priests to conduct St. Joseph's Seminary in Troy. The bishop proposed four priests, including Gabriels. Reaching the United States in October 1864, he served as professor of dogma for seven years, and to this church history was added in 1870. From 1871 to 1892, he was President of St. Joseph's. He was also named one of the four secretaries of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1884. On 20 December 1891, Gabriels was appointed the second Bishop of Ogdensburg by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on 5 May 1892 from Archbishop Michael Corrigan, with Bishops Francis McNeirny and Patrick Anthony Ludden serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of Albany. He was installed at the Cathedral of Ogdensburg by Bishop Bernard John McQuaid on the following 11 May. Bishop Gabriels wrote the \\"Diocese of Ogdensburg\\" article for the Catholic Encyclopedia. He was an Officer of the Order of Leopold. During his twenty-nine years as bishop, he established several churches and schools. He died at age 82.

His imperium was prorogued as propraetor into 199 so he could continue to look into the sacrilege. The year was plagued by bad omens; Minucius reported two from his province, a foal born with five feet, and three chickens born with three feet each.Livy 32.1.7–8, 11 English translation online. In his study of the praetorship during the Republic, T. Corey Brennan has speculated that the prosecution of sacrilege at Bruttium may have been a useful way to out and suppress the \\"dissident element\\" in the region; the stated task of Minucius's prorogation was \\"to complete inquiries into coniurationes among the Bruttii.\\"T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 332, note 135 online. The word coniuratio during this period carried multiple connotations; literally a \\"swearing together\\" or \\"oath,\\" it could refer both to a ritualized oath-taking and to a political conspiracy. The suppression of the Bacchanalia thirteen years later, recorded by Livy and a bronze tablet inscribed with the senate's decree, was also described as a series of coniurationes, and demonstrates at least a perceived connection between political dissent and private religious practices. Those whom Minucius arrested at Bruttium for sacrilege were sent to Rome, then returned to Locri with instructions from the senate that they restore the funds taken from the shrine.Erich S. Gruen, \\"The Bacchanalia Affair,\\" in Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy (Brill, 1990), p. 44 online. Compromised triumph As consul in 197, Minucius fought against Gauls and Ligurians. Both consuls of this year were assigned military commands in Italy, and coordinated strategically.Polybius 18.11.2 and 12.1; Livy 32.28.8. Minucius advanced to Genua (modern Genoa) and proceeded to Liguria, where he fought a campaign. He then crossed the Apennines and ravaged the country of the Gallic Boii, whose request for aid from the Insubres went unanswered.For more perspective on this campaign, see W.V. Harris, \\"Roman Expansion in the West,\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 2nd ed.), vol. 8, p. 112 online. Minucius's consular colleague, C. Cornelius Cethegus, fought against Insubres and Cenomani, but achieved his victory in a single pitched battle that resulted in the mass slaughter of 35,000 men and the capture of 5,200.Livy 32.29–31. The reports sent by the two commanders were greeted by a decree of a four-day supplicatio, or thanksgiving, and both presented themselves at the Temple of Bellona to ask jointly for a triumph. Two tribunes, however, came forward to block Minucius's request, and after two days of argument, he withdrew. Cethegus resubmitted his request, which the senate approved omnium consensu, \\"with the consent of all.\\"Livy 33.22–23; MRR1 pp. 332–333. The senate denied Minucius the same honour in part because, Livy says, he had taken no hostages to prove he had captured the number of towns he claimed.Joel Allen, Hostages and Hostage-Taking in the Roman Empire (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 99 online. It was further alleged that he had lost too many men in a series of battles that had decided little.Miriam R. Pelikan Pittenger, Contested Triumphs: Politics, Pageantry, and Performance in Livy's Republican Rome (University of California Press, 2009), pp. 77–78 online. For further discussion of the political context, see T. Corey Brennan, \\"Triumphus in Monte Albano,\\" in Transitions to Empire: Essays in Greco-Roman History, 360–146 B.C., in Honor of E. Badian (Norman, Okla., 1996), pp. 315–337. Minucius then staged his own triumphSometimes reckoned as an ovation instead of a triumph, but Brennan (Praetorship, pp. 148–149) asserts that the Alban triumph was a higher honor, since the ovatio was held on foot, not from a triumphal car. over the Boii and LiguriansLivy 32.28–31, 33.22–23; Acta Triumphalia Degrassi 78f., 552; MRR1 pp. 332–333. on the Alban Mount. Although the triumph was registered in the Fasti Triumphales and was carried out with the usual trappings, without senate authorization the triumphator had to present the celebration at his own expense, from booty won at war; this necessity led to accusations that Minucius had appropriated the funds from the public treasury.Eric M. Orlin, Temples, Religion, and Politics in the Roman Republic (Brill, 2002), pp. 66–67 online; Geoffrey S. Sumi, Ceremony and Power: Performing Politics in Rome between Republic and Empire (University of Michigan Press, 2005), p. 278, note 74 online. Diplomatic missions Antiochus Despite the opposition to his triumph, Minucius continued to have political influence and must have demonstrated skill as an administrator, as he plays a role in international negotiations throughout the 180s and possibly again in 174. In the wake of the Galatian War, he was among the ten legati sent in 189–188 BC with the proconsul Manlius Vulso to work out the terms of a treaty with Antiochus.Polybius 21.4–45 and 22.5; Livy 38.38–40 and 45–46. Questions had been raised about Vulso's right to a triumph for his Galatian victories; it was the position of the ten commissioners that he had not been authorized to take action because there had been no official declaration of war by the senate. The controversy indicates an early anxiety that the imperium exercised by a magistrate or pro-magistrate acting abroad could distort power relations within the republican system of government.Pittenger, Contested Triumphs, pp. 213ff. online; Erich S. Gruen, \\"The 'Fall' of the Scipios,\\" in Leaders and Masses in the Roman World: Studies in Honor of Zvi Yavetz (Brill, 1995), pp. 64–65 online. In 183, Minucius served on a three-man embassy to Transalpine Gaul to try to prevent the Celts from entering northern Italy.Livy 39.54.11–55.4. In 174, he may have been the Quintus Minucius who was sent to Crete with ten ships to settle unrest.Livy 41.25.7.

Path to politics A native of the Free City of Frankfurt and a librarian by profession, he initially studied law at the University of Marburg but dropped it for Volkskunde and became a noted folklorist.Dan S. White, The Splintered Party: National Liberalism in Hessen and the Reich, 1867-1918, 1976, p. 136 He obtained his doctorate in 1882, having also studied at the University of Giessen, Heidelberg University and Leipzig University, with time also spent studying languages.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1990, p. 39 Böckel witnessed the economic hardship of small farmers in the Grand Duchy of Hesse and the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. This had several causes, such as falling agrarian prices due to international competition, backward production methods, uneconomic division of farmland and the rural depopulation because of industrialization. However, Böckel concluded that the real cause behind this were Jewish merchants and profiteers who had a strong position in the trade with farmers in Hesse. In 1887 he published a pamphlet, Die Juden - die Könige unserer Zeit (The Jews - the kings of our times), in which he attacked the Jews for their perceived dominance over German life.Karl Dietrich Bracher, The German Dictatorship, 1970, p. 60 He presented a populist appeal to the peasantry, which along with his natural charisma and good looks, made him very popular and saw him dubbed the \\"Hessian peasant-king\\" by his supporters. In the election that same year he became the first independent anti-semite to be elected to the Reichstag. Böckel was elected to the Reichstag on a platform of both anti-Semitism and support for the establishment of peasant co- operatives.Richard J. Evans, The Coming Of The Third Reich, 2004, p. 24 A disciple of Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl, he shared his faith in the common man against the higher echelons of society. His slogan was Gegen Junker und Juden (Against Barons and Jews), indicating his nature as an opponent of both the Jews and the big landowners. His election in Marburg, secured at the expense of a sitting German Conservative Party member, meant that he would be the youngest member of the body and helped to secure him the nickname of the 'peasant king'.Albert S. Lindemann, Esau's Tears: Modern Anti-Semitism and the Rise of the Jews, 2000, p. 152 Böckel also published his own newspaper, Reichsherold, which was anti-clerical, anti-capitalist and advocated some radical democratic ideals as well as being highly anti-semitic. He sometimes wrote under the name Dr. Capistrano, in tribute to Saint John of Capistrano, who was known as the \\"Scourge of the Jews\\". Political activity Initially an independent at the start of the 1890s he formed his own group, the Antisemitische Volkspartei.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism, 2005, p. 124 This party ran in alliance with the Deutschsoziale antisemitische Partei of Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg in the 1890 election, with the new alliance capturing five seats of which four were held by Böckel's party.Bracher, German Dictatorship p. 61 As well as his political movement, Böckel also organised the Mitteldeutscher Bauernverein, an anti-semitic agrarian movement that counted as many as 15,000 members involved co-operative and banking schemes that purposefully sought to exclude Jews.Richard S. Levy, Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 1, 2005, p. 76 His various movements provided an early entry to politics for later figures such as Heinrich Class.Levy, Antisemitism, p. 130 The youngest member of the Reichstag, he continued his populist appeals, holding mass torch-lit rallies of his followers, a technique later favoured by the Nazi Party. In 1893 the Antisemitische Volkspartei merged with Oswald Zimmermann's followers under the name German Reform Party. Decline However the Tivoli Congress killed off Böckel's political influence as the German Conservative Party adopted anti-Semitism and he rejected overtures from Theodor Fritsch to become part of a wider anti-semitic coalition as he disliked Fritsch personally.Evans, The Coming Of The Third Reich, p. 24 Böckel was replaced as leader of the independent anti-semites in 1894 by Otto Hirschel and Philipp Köhler and his influence declined.White, The Splintered Party, p. 146 Meanwhile, his agrarian group, hamstrung somewhat by Böckel's own lack of money was, much to his dismay, largely swallowed up by the Junker-controlled Agrarian League. He was attacked by conservative anti-semites such as Adolf Stoecker for a supposed lack of commitment, with a comment Böckel made that \\"the money-greedy capitalist, never mind whether Jew or non-Jew, is the destroying angel of our people\\" used by his critics to claim that he had abandoned anti-semitism for socialism. He lost his seat in the 1903 election but returned in 1907 when the independent anti-semites had an unexpected growth in support. However he had grown disillusioned with the democratic process, whilst his reputation had been damaged by fathering an illegitimate child, and he left politics in 1909. Having become reconciled to the more traditional right he occasionally spoke for the Conservatives and the Agrarian League but a failed attempt to return to the Reichstag in 1912 was to be his last political activity. He retired to Michendorf in Brandenburg and faded into obscurity, dying in poverty.

In Proceedings of the Thirty-Fifth Annual Convention of the Catholic Theological Society of America 35 (1980): 337-347. Fenton was a familiar figure with his cassock and biretta on the campus of The Catholic University of America for 25 years. His students remember him as an imposing person who lectured dramatically and often challenged them with unexpected questions. Fenton's colorful expressions and trenchant observations became legendary. During his career, Fenton received many ecclesiastical honors from Rome. The Holy See named him a papal chamberlain (1951), a domestic prelate (1954), and a protonotary apostolic (1963). Recipient of the papal medal, Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice (1954), he belonged to the Pontifical Roman Theological Academy and served as a counselor to the Sacred Congregation of Seminaries and Universities (1950–67). Fenton died in Chicopee Falls, MA, on July 7, 1969. First officers of the Catholic Theological Society of America (CTSA), left to right: Fr. James E. Rea, Fr. Gerard Yelle, Fr. Joseph Clifford Fenton, Fr. Francis J. Connell (seated) Works Throughout his life, Fenton wrote an abundance of articles, especially on ecclesiology and Church-state relations. Most of Fenton's articles were published in the American Ecclesiastical Review, though he also contributed to Columbia, America, Fortnightly Review, Catholic Educational Review and Le Seminaire. Fenton's writing career also encompasses six books which he authored: *The Theology of Prayer (1939) *The Concept of Sacred Theology (1941) *We Stand with Christ (1943) *The Calling of a Diocesan Priest (1944) *The Concept of the Diocesan Priesthood (1951) *The Catholic Church and Salvation (1958) The twenty-first century has seen something of a revival of interest in Fenton's books. In 2006, his book The Catholic Church and Salvation, a scholarly in-depth explanation of the Catholic dogma \\"No Salvation Outside the Church\\", was republished by the Society of St. Pius V's Seminary Press in Round Top, New York. In 2016, his book We Stand with Christ was republished by Emmaus Road Publishing under the title Laying the Foundation: A Handbook of Catholic Apologetics and Fundamental Theology. Also in 2016, Christian D. Washburn (Associate Professor of Dogmatic Theology, at the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity, in St. Paul, MN) edited a collection of Fenton's essays from American Ecclesiastical Review under the title The Church of Christ: A Collection of Essays by Monsignor Joseph C. Fenton, published by Cluny Media. Cluny Media has overseen the bulk of the revival in Fenton's works, releasing new editions of Fenton's The Theology of Prayer and The Concept of Diocesan Priesthood, under the title The Diocesan Priest in the Church of Christ, and including Fenton's dissertation—The Concept of Sacred Theology—in its Thomist Tradition Series, under the title What Is Sacred Theology? During the first years of the Second Vatican Council, Fenton was a member of the preparatory Theological Commission, the Doctrinal Commission, the Commission on Faith and Morals, and also a peritus. As a controversialist, he is best remembered for his aggressive opposition to John Courtney Murray, S.J., on religious freedom and on the relationship between Church and State.GRANFIELD, P. \\"Fenton, Joseph Clifford.\\" New Catholic Encyclopedia.

Plot  While out for a jog in the community of Redston, a woman named Nancy is hacked to death with an felling axe by a man wearing a fighter pilot helmet. Later, two couples consisting of Jon and Carrie, and Amy and Chris, head to Redston to camp out for the weekend, but on the way there they encounter a pair of hillbillies named Rich and Gene, who attack them. After the encounter with the backwoods duo (revealed to be the brothers of the fighter helmet-wearing man, Joe) the quartet set up near some abandoned cabins, while the hillbillies murder would-be pranksters John and Ray. After wandering off alone to get her cigarettes, Carrie is killed by Gene and Joe, and her friends are captured while looking for her. Jon is knocked out in a fight with Joe, and disemboweled and eaten by the brothers, who force feed the other captives some of his innards. When Gene and Joe leave with Jon's body, Rich butchers Chris, and tries to rape Amy, but is stabbed with his own knife, and left for dead. Traversing the wilderness, Amy encounters Joe, and during the ensuing scuffle pulls off his helmet, revealing his disfigured face. After Joe runs off, Gene and the recovered Rich recapture Amy, and cut out and eat her unborn child. An unknown amount of time later, the brothers are shown partaking in an unsuccessful hunt, and when Rich suggests they merely get fast food, Gene scolds him, reminding him that they promised their mother they would never eat those chemical-soaked foods. When Rich continues to complain, Gene and Joe become annoyed, and seemingly decide to eat him.  Cast  * Jon McBride as Jon * Amy Chludzinski as Amy * Christopher A.

The policies were in force until the emperor's death, then repealed, then enacted again and were a focus of court politics until the end of the Northern Song. In some ways it continued the policies of the aborted Qingli Reforms from two decades earlier. The reforms According to Mary Nourse, Wang Anshi believed that: > The state should take the entire management of commerce, industry, and > agriculture into its own hands, with a view to succoring the working classes > and preventing them from being ground into the dust by the rich.\\"Nourse, > Mary A. 1944.

There were three main components to this policy: 1) state finance and trade, 2) defense and social order, and 3) education and improving of governance. Some of the finance reforms included paying cash for labor in place of corvée labor, increasing the supply of copper coins, improving management of trade, and the program () which provided direct government loan to farmers during planting seasons and to be repaid at harvest. He believed that foundation of the state rested on the well-being of the common people. To limit speculation and eliminate private monopolies, he initiated price control and regulated wages and set up pensions for the aged and unemployed. The state also began to institute public orphanages, hospitals, dispensaries, hospices, cemeteries, and reserve granaries.Song Dynasty Renaissance 960-1279 The military reform centered on a new institution of the baojia system or organized households. This was done to ensure collective responsibility in society and was later used to strengthen local defense. He also proposed the creation of systems to breed military horses, the more efficient manufacture of weapons and training of the militia. To improve education and government, he sought to break down the barrier between clerical and official careers as well as improving their supervision to prevent connections being used for personal gain. Tests in law, military affairs and medicine were added to the examination system, with mathematics added in 1104. The National Academy was transformed into a real school rather than simply a holding place for officials waiting for appointments. However, there was deep-seated resistance to the education reforms as it hurt bureaucrats coming in under the old system. Contention over the reforms  The reforms created political factions in the court. Wang Anshi's faction, known as the \\"Reformers\\", were opposed by the ministers in the \\"Conservative\\" faction led by the historian and Chancellor Sima Guang (1019–1086).. As one faction supplanted another in the majority position of the court ministers, it would demote rival officials and exile them to govern remote frontier regions of the empire. One of the prominent victims of the political rivalry, the famous poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101), was jailed and eventually exiled for criticizing Wang's reforms. The Green Sprouts program and the baojia system were not conceived as revenue-generating policies but soon were changed to finance new state initiatives and military campaigns. Within a few months of the start of the Green Sprouts program in 1069 the government started to charge an annual interest of 20-30% on the loans it made to farmers. As the officials of the Ever-Normal Granaries who were managing the program were evaluated based on the revenue they could generate, this resulted in forced loans and lack of focus on the disaster relief, which was the original task of the Ever-Normal Granaries. In 1074, a famine in northern China drove many farmers off their lands. Their circumstances were made worse by the debts they had incurred from the seasonal loans granted under Wang’s reform initiatives. Local officials insisted on collecting on the loans as the farmers were leaving their land. This crisis was depicted as being Wang’s fault. Wang still had the emperor's favor, though he resigned in 1076. With the emperor's death in 1085, the reforms were abolished under the regency of Dowager Empress Xiang, only to be reinstituted when the new Emperor Zhezong came of age in 1093. The policies largely continued under the reign of Emperor Huizong until the end of the Northern Song dynasty in 1126.

Set in 1930s Hollywood, the story revolves around a wannabe Western writer who finds himself cast as a leading man in several B-movie westerns. Despite good reviews, the film was a financial disappointment for MGM upon release in 1975, but it has since developed a significant cult following among midnight showings and college campuses. Screenwriter Rob Thompson launched his career with this film. He went on to be a major creative talent on the television series Northern Exposure (for which he won an Emmy) and Monk. Plot In 1933, Lewis Tater (Jeff Bridges), an aspiring novelist who harbors dreams of becoming the next Zane Grey, decides to leave his family home in Iowa to go to the University of Titan in Nevada so he can soak up the western atmosphere. He arrives to find that there is no university, only a mail order correspondence course scam run by two crooks out of the local hotel. He tries to spend the night at the hotel, but is attacked by one of the men in an attempted robbery. He escapes his attacker, grabs his suitcase, and steals their car to get away, but after a while it runs out of gas. He looks in the car trunk, and finds a toolbox containing a revolver and ammunition. Afraid the two crooks are still in pursuit of him, he takes the tool box and his suitcase and walks off into the desert. Wandering and exhausted, the next morning he happens upon a threadbare film-unit from Tumbleweed Productions grinding out a \\"B\\" western. Later that day, he catches a lift with the cowboy actors to Los Angeles. After applying for work at Tumbleweed, he is referred by crusty old extra Howard Pike (Andy Griffith) to the Rio, a western-themed restaurant. While washing dishes at the Rio, he is called by Tumbleweed, where Howard mentors him to be an actor. After proving himself as a stuntman, unit manager Kessler (Alan Arkin) offers him a speaking role. Tater then falls in love with spunky script girl Miss Trout (Blythe Danner). Meanwhile, the crooks trace him to Los Angeles to retrieve the safe-box containing their money that was in the car stolen by Lewis.

The hospital where Charley works is ineptly run by Dr. Amos Willoughby, a senile chief of staff. Typical of the incompetence there is the way a fractured jaw of patient Ann Atkinson is being treated by Willoughby with a primitive contraption. Charley frees her from the device, angering Willoughby for stealing a patient. Charley and his pal Dr. Norman Solomon know something needs to be done about Willoughby, but because the \\"old fart\\" now has a hold on him, Charley agrees to nominate Willoughby for one more term as the hospital's chief. The divorced Ann proves attractive to Charley. She is a bright conversationalist and bakes delicious cheesecake that she sells. Charley enjoys being with her and helps her land a job at the hospital, but with all the available women out there, he is reluctant to commit to a monogamous relationship. Ann finally persuades him to agree to a trial period of a few weeks. At the hospital, a botched diagnosis leads to the death of a wealthy owner of a baseball team. The widow, Ellen Grady, intends to sue for millions, saying the only thing she knows about medicine is that nobody at this place can practice it. Charley tries to charm her. They share a common background and Mrs. Grady is definitely interested in him.

Goldigger is about the California Gold Rush. Xarkrow, the lead character, leaves his home in Fortanska, a fictional city in Hungary, to go to California to dig for gold in the hills of the Sierra Nevada. While there he strikes it rich with great gold. This causes a female loan shark named Ygretta Roselettokopf of San Francisco to try to seduce him for his money; this concept gives a double meaning to the title of the film. After his climatic battle with gold warden Amadeus Krone he shouts his famous and compelling line \\"I come to Californee for find of gold, not to have fight with you.\\" Following the defeat of Krone in their heated pistol and gilded fist battle, Ygretta Roselettokopf returns with important news.

The film revolves around a down-and-out music promoter who inadvertently becomes a successful professional wrestling manager. After being exiled from the business by a rival manager, he finds success in promoting shows that feature both wrestling and rock music. The film features many well-known wrestlers of the time and references the Rock 'n' Wrestling era of professional wrestling. Hal Needham had arguments with the pair that produced and wrote the film regarding his changes to the script, resulting in lawsuits that delayed the film's release. As a result, the film was never theatrically released and was instead released direct-to-video. It was Needham's final film. Plot M. Harry Smilac (Dirk Benedict), once a successful music promoter, is having a hard time attracting talent and booking gigs for his sole client, the rock band Kick. Behind on his car payments and owing a large amount to a banker, he reluctantly accepts a job finding musical acts for the fundraiser of an unpopular politician. Although not entirely happy with his new gig, Smilac finds a love interest in Candace Vandervagen (Tanya Roberts), the daughter of the politician's wealthy campaign booster. While making arrangements for the fundraiser, Smilac mistakes pro wrestler Rick Roberts (Roddy Piper) for a musician and hires him. Having zero luck as a music manager, Smilac decides to stick with his hunch about Roberts and become a pro wrestling manager, booking matches for Roberts and his teammate Tonga Tom (Sam Fatu). The team is a success but politics come into play when Smilac clashes with Rick's former manager, the villainous Captain Lou Murano (Lou Albano). A day after a disastrous fundraiser featuring Smilac's rock band, Murano and his tag team champions The Cannibals (Sione Vailahi and Tom Cassett) injure Harry and his wrestlers in a nationally televised bout, before blacklisting them from every major arena in the country. Recovering from their injuries and on the fringes of both the music and wrestling industries, Harry decides to take his wrestlers and his band on a cross country road tour of small arenas. Initially he promotes separate wrestling and rock shows, but a scheduling mix- up at a venue causes him to promote a single event featuring both music and wrestling. The show is well received and Smilac schedules an entire tour using the same \\"Rock n' Wrestling\\" format. Their tour is a huge success, which angers Captain Lou Murano. On a televised appearance, Harry challenges Captain Lou's Cannibals to a match for the World Tag Team Championships on behalf of his Rick Roberts and Tonga Tom. After a hard fought match, Rick and Tom beat the Cannibals to become the new champions. Cast *Dirk Benedict as M. Harry Smilac. He was Needham's first choice for the role based on Benedict's work on the television show The A-Team. Although Benedict had previously worked with professional wrestler Hulk Hogan on an episode of The A-Team, Benedict only found out about the scripted nature of professional wrestling through his work on this film. *Roddy Piper as \\"Quick\\" Rick Roberts. Piper was best known for his work with the World Wrestling Federation. He would go on to star in other films such as Hell Comes to Frogtown and John Carpenter's They Live. *Sam Fatu as Tonga Tom. Fatu is a member of wrestling's famed Anoa'i family. His most well known ring name is The Tonga Kid. *Kellie Martin as Missy Roberts. Several years after starring in the movie, a 14-year-old Martin mentioned that the film never made it to theaters and called it \\"kind of a flop.\\" *Tanya Roberts as Candace Vandervagen *Captain Lou Albano as Captain Lou Murano. Albano was already a well-known wrestling manager and veteran of the wrestling business when he played the role in the film. *Afa Anoa'i and Sika Anoa'i as The Samoans. Like Fatu, both are members of the Anoa'i family. The two star as bodyguards in the film in non-speaking roles. However, they also had successful real life wrestling careers as the tag team The Wild Samoans, with Lou Albano as their manager. The duo was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007. *Sione Vailahi and Thomas Leroy Kasat as The Cannibals. Both were professional wrestlers, and infrequently teamed for Jim Crockett Promotions house shows in 1986.Matches fought as a team by Teijo Khan and The Barbarian, from Wrestlingdata.com Vailahi is best known for his work in World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling as The Barbarian. The duo staged a real fight with Piper and Fatu during the filming of the movie's final match so the crowd of extras would take them seriously. *Charles Nelson Reilly as Vic Carson. Reilly had previously starred in another Hal Needham film, Cannonball Run II. *Billy Barty as Tim McClusky *John Astin as Scotty the car dealer *John Fujioka as Mr. Kim *Wrestling personalities Ric Flair, Freddie Blassie, Adnan Al-Kaissie, Bruno Sammartino and Alexis Smirnoff, Teijo Kahn appear in cameos as audience members during the film's final match. Production and release In an interview with Canadian Online Explorer, Dirk Benedict recounts positive experiences working on the film. However, both he and director Hal Needham clashed with the two lawyers credited with writing and producing the film over changes to the script and Needham's creative choices. At one point, Benedict had a physical altercation with one of the writers/producers. These conflicts led to lawsuits being filed, which caused the film to miss the entire summer movie season. Later, the film was slated to be released by Hemdale Film Corporation in November 1986. However, the film never saw wide theatrical release and was instead released directly to VHS. On March 15, 2011, Body Slam was brought to DVD as part of the MGM Limited Edition Collection series. Reception The film was met with mixed reviews. TV Guide rated it at two stars, describing it as a \\"raucous action comedy with a certain (admittedly dubious) historical appeal.\\" Mick Martin and Marsha Porter also gave it two stars, calling the film \\"silly\\" but saying that it had \\"a lot of heart.\\" Leonard Maltin gave the film two-and-a-half stars, calling Dirk Benedict's performance \\"charming\\" and lamenting that the film was not widely released, saying that it \\"deserved better.\\" Variety gave the film a positive review, calling it a \\"pleasant surprise\\" and \\"genuinely funny.\\" They praised Dirk Benedict's performance and called the film a \\"solid comeback\\" for director Hal Needham.

It is located northeast of the intersection of Lawrence Avenue and Bellamy Road in Scarborough. It is estimated to date from the 14th century and is estimated to contain the skeletons of over 500 Huron/Wendat. It is believed to be the only First Nations ossuary protected as a cemetery in Canada. Site The ossuary/cemetery covers an area of and is shaped as a mound. The ossuary was eventually found to be about fifty feet long, seven feet wide, and one foot deep. Kenyon first estimated that 472 individuals were buried there. The site was first estimated to date to circa 1250 AD. Further studies of the site determined that the site was not one of the Six Nations, but rather one of the Wyandot (Huron) peoples, who are related to the Six Nations. The total number of buried skeletons was revised to be 523, and the burial mound was estimated to date to the 14th century. The skeletons were buried in a ritual manner consistent with the Wendat Feast of Souls. In the same year that the ossuary was found, an Iroquoian village site was excavated west of this location at Brimley Road where it crosses West Highland Creek. The two sites are believed to be linked. Another, larger Huron/Wendat village site (known as the \\"Alexandra Site\\") was found in 2000 just north of L'Amoreaux Park (North) northwest of McNicoll and Kennedy. An estimate of the number of persons residing in the larger site is between 800–1000. Archaeologists who studied the larger site believe it is possible the three sites may be linked. Other sites exist within the Rouge River valley (the Elliot site, Robb site, the Fairty ossuary, the Milroy site and Draper site) that are also Iroquoian. History The cemetery was discovered on August 17, 1956, when a steam shovel was in the process of demolishing the high hill. The soil was being transported for use in constructing an overpass for Highway 401 and the cleared site was then intended to be turned into the Bendale suburban subdivision. After digging some one hundred feet into the hill the workers found a large collection of human bones. Work immediately stopped at the site to allow for an expert investigation. Scarborough Reeve Gus Harris first announced that the found bones were not of Indian (indigenous) origin due to a lack of artifacts and were instead a disposal of bones or mass burial of a cholera epidemic of 1870. Royal Ontario Museum assistant curator of ethnology Walter Kenyon supervised an archaeological examination of the site. The examination found a second burial pit. Kenyon described the larger pit as \\"the deepest ossuary I have ever seen or heard of\\" and \\"the most significant ethnological discovery in Canada's history.\\" The site was declared a historical site on August 22, 1956, by Bryan Cathcart, Ontario Minister of Travel and Publicity, invoking the Protection of Archeological and Historic Sites Act. The site was then put under police guard to prevent loss of artifacts after a copper bead was taken away by a child. The Government of Ontario purchased the site, exchanging it for land elsewhere in the area. Representatives of the Iroquois Six Nations were invited to supervise an Iroquois Feast of the Dead reburial ceremony. The ceremony was held over three days from October 19–21, supervised by Chief Joseph Logan and was attended by more than 200 indigenous people and several thousand outsiders. The Iroquois ritual was by tradition a closed ceremony and some Iroquois did not attend for that reason. A new hole was dug for re-interment of the bones five deep and the bones re-interred with wolf pelts on top. A banquet was subsequently held at the Scarborough Golf Club, which was marred by insensitive remarks by Jack Pickersgill, then the federal minister of citizenship and immigration. Iroquois representatives held annual Feast of the Dead ceremonies from 1957 until 1966. In 1961, a memorial was installed at the top of the mound. It has a Scarborough Township historical plaque on one side. The other side has a plaque with a prayer incorrectly attributed to \\"White Cloud\\" and a statement that reads \\"Approved by Iroquois Council 3-3-60\\" - however, the origin of this prayer is the Lakota Nation, translated to English by Chief Yellow Lark in 1887 and published in the collection Native American Prayers, by the Episcopal Church. The site is designated as a cemetery and is administered by the City of Toronto government. The surrounding area is known as Tabor Hill Park. While designated a cemetery, there have been concerns that the area is often used as a park. Tobogganing is an especially popular activity on the steep hill.

Retrieved 29 August 2009. In 1916 Arnot refused conscription to the British army and was imprisoned as a conscientious objector; he accepted transfer to the Home Office Scheme, and served some two years in the Wakefield Work Centre. When he was freed in 1919, he returned to his post as the Secretary of the Labour Research Department. In 1919, in response to labour unrest in the coal mines, the British government established a Committee of Inquiry. The Miners' Federation sought the aid of the Labour Research Department in marshalling evidence on behalf of the workers' demand for higher wages, shorter hours, and government ownership of the mines. Political career Arnot was a foundation member of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920. Coming as he did from a background as a guild socialist, Arnot favoured close integration of the Communist Party with the broader labour movement, including affiliation as a member organisation under the Labour Party's umbrella.Graham Stevenson, \\"Robin Page Arnot\\", Communist Biographies. Retrieved 29 August 2009. He was a co- founder, along with R. Palme Dutt and W.N.

His private collection of Labour Movement documents was astounding: for example, a hand-written notebook which had once belonged to David Moffatt, grandfather of Alex and Abe Moffatt (the Scottish trades union leaders) who had been hounded from coal-mine to coal-mine down the northeastern coast of Britain by one vinctive mine-owner after another. On one side of the n the accounts of whichever branch of the N.U.M. he happened to be working at, while on the reverse side there were extensive notes not only from Marx and Engels but also from Ruskin, John Stuart Mill, Charles Darwin, T.H. Huxley, Herbert Spencer and H.G. Wells, to name but a few. Robin cherished the volume which he pulled out from time to time to demonstrate to his guest precisely what the self-educating, culturally aspiring working-men of the 19th century - the founders of the Labour Party - were like. Arnot was also arrested in 1986 and accused of being a spy for the Soviet Union. He was released in what seemed to many as a cover-up and a bribe. He was seen meeting with a Soviet Intelligence Officer multiple times. He denied the accusations and M15 (British Counter- Intelligence agency) conducted an Investigation the results of which are still Classified and not set to be released until 2056.Dipak Nandy, \\"Arnold Kettle & the Evolution of English Marxist Literary Criticism\\", introduction to G.M.

He then initiates a plan: that they create a sand castle for them to reside in. With each other's help, the sand castle is eventually completed and the sand characters celebrate. The celebration is cut shortly when wind begins to blow and covers up the sand castle, with the sand characters retreating inside for safety.

The film was remade for American audiences by James Young in 1921, starring George Arliss in his film debut.Silent Era entry Production background From the original ad campaign, \\"Here is a story mounted in settings and scenes of splendor and luxury. A story that is as old as yesterday; as true as today; and as new as tomorrow. A production of real mark and unexcelled distinction. As the central figure George Arliss is an unforgettable picture of fiendish, subtle, domineering and diabolic ingenuity; of cunning, sardonic and unrelenting resourcefulness. Yet he is the suave, charming, polished and artistic Devil.\\" This satiric drama was based on the 1908 play by Ferenc Molnar that launched Arliss on Broadway, and was used to entice him into his very first (of many) films. Earlier versions were made by no less than Thomas Edison and D.W. Griffith. The original play title was \\"The Devil; A Comedy in Three Acts.\\" In an interview from Motion Picture World, January 1921, Mr. Arliss told reporters he decided to go into films, after being impressed by the work of Charlie Chaplin. The director then made a screen test to show Arliss how intimate the camera was, and how it exaggerated gestures. Arliss said films would probably lead to better acting on the stage, when actors could study their technique on the big screen. Plot Dr. Muller (Arliss), a friend to all, finds pleasure in turning the goodness in people to evil ends. He meets Marie Matin (Lucy Cotton) and her fiancé, Georges Roben (Roland Bottomley), while viewing a new painting, \\"The Martyr-Truth Crucified by Evil.\\" Marie declares that the picture was wrong: Evil could never triumph over Truth, and though Muller says he agrees with her, he plots to prove otherwise. To this end, he entangles Marie with artist Paul de Veaux (Edmund Lowe), Georges's best friend, causing the latter's model, Mimi (Sylvia Breamer), to become jealous. Georges, believing that he is standing between Paul and Marie, releases Marie from her engagement. Marie finds Paul and Mimi alone together, late one evening, and turns back to Georges, whom she marries. This does not discourage Muller, who but for Marie's purity almost succeeds in his evil designs. As a last resort, Muller lures Marie to his apartment to trick her. There in a moment of dramatic conflict—she prays for help; a vision of a shining cross appears; and Muller is consumed in flames. Note: This was also the first film for Fredric March and Mrs. George Arliss. Preservation status This once lost film has recently been rediscovered and is now being restored by the Library of Congress Motion Picture Conservation Center in Dayton, Ohio. On a 2010 episode of The History Channel series American Pickers the show's hosts are invited to search under the stage of a turn of the century theater and film hall.

He travelled to Montpellier at the age of 21 to study medicine, and became a student of Guillaume Rondelet, the chancellor of the Medical Faculty at the University of Montpellier. Soon after Rondelet's death in 1556, Joubert succeeded him as chancellor. He was later summoned by Catherine de' Medici, the queen consort of France, to be her personal physician. Joubert went on to become one of the physicians to Henry III of France. Joubert was married to Louise Guichard, the sister of the doctor to the King of Navarre.Broomhall (2004) p. 63  Biography and works Born in Dauphiné, France, Joubert was a significant figure in a movement that sought to challenge medical superstitions and ignorance in France. In his two-volume Erreurs Populaires of 1578, he made clear, for example, that it was untrue that male children were born at full moon and female children at new moon. On the other hand, he erroneously suggested that a male child could be conceived at certain times of night or the month. Joubert's stated aim was to raise physicians and surgeons from their \\"routine illiterate practice\\" and to inform the people how better to look after themselves. In this endeavour, he made use of the growing influence of the press, contributing to the transfer from an oral to a printed tradition in medical knowledge.Davis, 223–25. Joubert and his colleagues met with opposition from those who, regarding the classical Greek and Latin medical texts as sacrosanct, were suspicious of medical advice written in French. Joubert argued that those who sought to deny people the knowledge to maintain their own health were no better than those who denied them the right to read religious texts in their own language. In effect, he was challenging closely guarded monopolies on medical knowledge, though he insisted that patients would be more likely to follow doctors' orders if they could understand them.Davis, 223–25. In Erreurs Populaires, Joubert addressed a series of popular errors in turn, which he documented and then discussed by reference to his own experience and practice. Of one local custom, he wrote: \\"Is it a good idea to sit a woman in labour on a hot cauldron, or to put her husband's hat on her stomach, as do the good women of the villages around Montpellier? The hat probably will not help much, except perhaps to serve as a compress and help expulsion\\".Davis, 260–61. Joubert thought the practice may have originated as a way to represent the husband at the delivery. Joubert wrote numerous medical texts in both Latin and French. Several of these were only published a few years before his death, and others continued to be published after he died, with the last work being published in 1603. His edition of Grande Chirurgie, a work by the 14th-century surgeon Guy de Chauliac, was a translation into French from the original Latin, making the work more accessible to contemporary surgeons. *Traitté des Arcbusades (1574) *Grande Chirurgie de M.

The young king inherited a kingdom already in severe decline, and his inexperience only made the decline faster, finally resulting in the end of House of Toungoo and the collapse of the kingdom over his 18-year reign.Htin Aung 1967: 152–156 Early life The future king was born to Prince Taninganway and his chief queen Thiri Maha Mingala Dewi. He was the fifth child and fourth son of the couple. He was given Singu in fief in his youth. He became the heir presumptive because all three elder brothers died young. He was made the heir apparent on 6 May 1727 (1st waning of Kason 1089 ME).Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 362 Reign Five years into his reign, the armies of Manipur invaded and plundered the northern Burmese provinces. The Burmese were unable to suppress them. Since the move of capital from Pegu to Ava by King Thalun in 1635, Pegu had become the rallying point for the Mon revival and insurgency. The Burmese governors were readily hatred due to heavy corrupted taxation. Taking the advantage of weak royal authority after the Manipur invasions, a Burmese governor rebelled and proclaimed himself the King of Pegu in 1740. The Mons, unwilling to have a Burmese king in Pegu, rioted and murdered the new king. Mahadhammaraza Dipati then installed his uncle as the new governor of Pegu. Yet the Mons were still unsatisfied and went on to kill Burmese officials in Pegu. The king was then enraged at the Mons and ordered a massacre of the Mons at Pegu. The Gwe Shans (the Shans who were taken as captives from their northern homelands to Pegu by King Bayinnaung in the 16th century) took this opportunity to stage their own rebellion. The Shan armies with supports from the Mons took Pegu in 1740. A popular monk of Shan origin was proclaimed Gwe Min the King of Pegu. As Ava was largely distracted by another Manipur invasion. The Peguan armies invaded Prome and Ava but failed. They were able to take Toungoo. Thado Minkhaung, the viceroy of Prome and Mahadhammaraza Dipati’s brother, hurried south and took Syriam but was soon repelled. Prome eventually fell to the Mons in 1745. The Mons tried to take Ava again without success. In 1747, Binnya Dala was proclaimed the King of Pegu. The two sides were unable to overcome each other until 1751 when the crown prince of Pegu (Binnya Dala’s brother) marched the Peguan armies into Upper Irrawaddy and laid siege on Sagaing and Ava. Ava fell to the Mons on 22 March 1752 (Wednesday, 8th waxing of Late Tagu 1113 ME) and Maha Dhammaraza Dipati was taken as captive down to Pegu.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 392–395 Mahadhammaraza Dipati had survived for another two years before being executed in 1754 due to a suspected rebellion.

Coe, who took him to Winfield, Kansas, where he grew up and learned the trades of making bricks and wooden pails.

While living in Winfield, he married Nellie Mae Powers, and they had one son, Alfred Alonzo.Wilson, Linda D. \\"Asp, Henry E.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed August 11, 2018. Move to Oklahoma Territory In July 1890, the Asps moved to Guthrie, the capital of the newly created Oklahoma Territory, where he became a lobbyist and solicitor for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. In 1892, Asp and two other Guthrie lawyers, John W. Shartel and James R. Cottingham, became partners in a law firm, handling some of the many land disputes arising after the Land Run of 1889. After most of the land cases were settled in the middle 1890s, Asp spent most of his time representing people who had moved to the Territory because it had more lenient divorce laws than the surrounding states. Asp also saw an opportunity when the Territorial Legislature provided for a Territorial university to be established in Norman. He handled most of the legal work during the formative years and was soon appointed to its board of trustees. In 1893, he and the school's new president, David R. Boyd, collaborated to obtain federal legislation to provide that section thirteen of each township be set aside for higher education. This was successful, and in gratitude, Norman named streets near the Oklahoma University campus for each of them. Preparing for statehood In 1906, Asp spent seven months in Washington D. C.lobbying for Oklahoma statehood, after the proposal to create a state of Sequoyah failed. He also used his rising political influence to ensure that the 1906 Enabling Act provided for his hometown of Guthrie become the capital of the new state. When he returned home, he was elected to the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention as representative from the 25th district. He was also named to several important committees (notably, the Judiciary Committee) and was named Minority Leader for the convention. He had become highly respected by the Democratic Party leaders, especially William H. Murray and Charles N. Haskell. Move to Oklahoma City In 1912, Asp moved his home from Guthrie to Oklahoma City. There, he established the law firm of Asp, Snyder, Owen, and Lybrand. and died on July 1, 1923, in Oklahoma City, following an unidentified surgery a week earlier.

He was a Belgian Jesuit priest, and missionary in India. As Indologist he became a renowned Sankara specialist.  Life  Born at Montignies-sur-Sambre, near Charleroi in Belgium, he came to India as a young Jesuit student of theology in 1946. Upon completion of his theological studies, he studied Sanskrit in Calcutta under Georges Dandoy, Pierre Fallon and Robert Antoine, all members of the so- called \\"Calcutta School\\" of Jesuit Indologists. Provoked by a talk by Dr S. Radhakrishnan at a meeting of the Indian Philosophical Congress at Calcutta in 1950, where Radhakrishnan claimed that Sankara was a purely rational philosopher, De Smet decided to show that he was, instead, a srutivadin, a theologian who subordinated reason to the revealed (apauruṣeyā) scripture. De Smet went on to do his doctorate on The Theological Method of Samkaracarya, completing it at the Gregorian University, Rome, in 1953.R.V. De Smet, The Theological Method of Samkaracarya, doctoral dissertation under the guidance of R. Arnou, SJ (Rome: Gregorian University, 1953). Though he never got round to publishing this thesis, it became famous among Indologists and there are hundreds of copies in circulation.J. Lipner,\\"Richard V. De Smet, S.J.—An Appreciation by Julius Lipner\\", Hindu-Christian Studies Bulletin 11 (1998) 52. Returning to India in March 1954, De Smet began to teach at the newly opened centre for philosophical studies of the Jesuits at De Nobili College, Pune. At first he was assigned courses traditional in Roman Catholic seminaries (which he taught in Latin, also composing Guidelines for students): Introduction to Philosophy + Minor Logic; General Metaphysics: Rational Theology (which he subtitled Brahma Jijnasa), Special Questions of Metaphysics. But he also introduced a course on Samkhya, and began inserting \\"large doses of Indian philosophy\\" into the traditional treatises. By 1968, he was able to open a special section for Indian Studies in his institute, by now renamed Jnana- Deepa Vidyapeeth (JDV). Over the years 1968–75, he composed his Guidelines in Indian Philosophy, cyclostyled notes for students beginning with the Ancient Indian Vedic period and going up to Sankara.R.V. De Smet, Guidelines in Indian Philosophy, cyclostyled notes for students (Pune: De Nobili College, 1968–75). The introduction and ch. 1 have been published in Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 20/2 (2009) 259–282. In the meantime, right from 1954 De Smet began attending various meetings of Indologists and Indian Philosophers: the Indian Philosophical Congress, the Poona Philosophy Association, the Bombay Philosophy Union, the newly formed Indian Philosophical Association. After an initially suspicious reception (a Dr Chubb roundly accused him of excessive missionary zeal at the Kandy session of the Indian Philosophical Congress in 1954), his competence and self-possession won the day and he soon found himself being invited to lecture or give courses at universities and colleges across the country. He was also asked to collaborate with the Marathi Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Marathi Tattvajnana Mahakosa) project in Pune, and went on to become the most prolific contributor with a total of 68 articles. Besides these, he wrote some 128 entries for Verbo: Enciclopedia Luso-Brasileira de Cultura, of which some 47 are still to be found in the latest edition, and 2 entries for the Telugu Encyclopedia. De Smet engaged not only in dialogue not only with academics and scholars but also with religious people. He was a frequent invitee to the Sivananda Ashram at Rishikesh, where he would lecture on Sankara and other topics, but also, on request, about Jesus and Christianity. He visited the Ramakrishna missions in various parts of the country, and also the Aurobindo Ashram at Pondicherry. He had contacts with the Caitanya Vaisnava movement at Vrindavan. Invited by the Sikhs to the four hundredth anniversary celebrations of their founder, he spoke about Guru Nanak and Jesus Christ. Despite not being an expert in Islam, he found himself being invited also by Muslims of the Jamia Millia University in Delhi. He spoke often to the Jains of Pune and wrote for their The Voice of Ahinsa. He participated in the pro-dialogue meetings organized by Swami Abhishiktananda (the French Benedictine monk Dom Henri Le Saux) under the patronage of the Swiss Ambassador, J.-A. Cuttat.R. De Smet, \\"The Trajectory of My Dialogical Activity\\", Autobiographic text for Bradley Malkovsky, Rome, 23 April 1991, unpublished. He was invited for lectures on Hinduism to the Kurisumala Ashram founded by Francis Acharya (Fr Francis Mahieu) at Vagamon, Kerala. He also engaged willingly with Christians of other denominations, teaching in their universities and seminaries, participating in their conferences, meetings and seminars, and even giving retreats to staff and students, far before the word ecumenism became popular in the Catholic Church. De Smet will be remembered for two major contributions to Indological scholarship. The first was his fresh interpretation of Sankara as a non- dualist realist rather than a world-denying illusionist. This interpretation hinged on his discovery, or rather reinforcement of Olivier Lacombe's discovery, of the fact that Sankara used analogical predication in expounding the meaning of the mahāvākyas (great sentences) of the Upanisads such as Tat- tvam-asi and Satyam Jnanam Anantam Brahma. The world is neither atyanta Sat like Brahman, nor is it atyanta Asat like the son of a barren woman. It is, instead, a reality that is completely and ontologically dependent on Brahman. And once the notion of creation is purified of anthropomorphism, it is possible to speak of Brahman as creator and cause of the world, without detriment to its oneness, immutability, perfection and freedom. The second was his demonstration that, given the original meaning of 'person' which was coined by Christian theologians to speak precisely of the divine mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation, the supreme Brahman (Nirguna Brahman), far from being impersonal, is indeed personal in the highest and supreme sense of the term. Richard De Smet died in Belgium on 2 March 1997. Julius J. Lipner, professor at Cambridge, student and friend of De Smet, called him one of the \\"unsung pioneers\\" of the interpretation of Indian thought, and his death \\"the end of an era in the annals of Indological scholarship in India,\\" the era of \\"the foreign missionary scholar who made India a home over many years, loved its peoples and its cultures, empathetically studied rich strands of its religious inheritance, and sought in a spirit of enlightened appreciation to enter into a dialogue at depth.\\"J. Lipner, \\"Richard V. De Smet, S.J.—An Appreciation by Julius Lipner\\", Hindu-Christian Studies Bulletin 11 (1998) 51–54. Bradley J.

Malkovsky,\\"Preface\\", New Perspectives in Advaita Vedānta: Essays in Commemoration of Professor Richard De Smet, SJ, ed. Bradley J. Malkovsky (Leiden / Boston / Köln: Brill, 2000 ) vii.  Writings  Early in his career, De Smet made the option to meet requests arising from his dialogical activity inside India rather than produce pieces of Indological research. He also decided to give preference to the requests of Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Muslims, etc. over those of Christians. As a consequence, most of his production consisted of occasional pieces in a wide variety of relatively inaccessible Indian publications. This also resulted in his hardly being known outside India. Even in India, the scattered nature of his output has resulted in his largely being ignored in Christian theological circles.

It was named and described by botanists Alfred Rehder and E.H.Wilson in 1912. Description Branches The terminal and secondary twigs of C. tenuipes are slender, cylindrical and tapering; initially grayish-yellow, later changing to brownish-red. They have shaggy hairs that lie flatly to the stem surface when new, which are lost by degrees over time. Leaves The leaves of C. tenuipes are typically 2-2.5 cm (occasionally up to 3.5 cm) long, and 1.5–2 cm wide, and range in shape from ovate or elliptic-ovate to narrowly elliptic-ovate. The undersides are grayish with raised veins, and covered with short, woolly hairs which lie flatly to the surface; the uppersides are green, with slightly impressed veins, and sparsely covered with long, thin, soft, weak, hairs when young, but nearly hairless with age. Both the leaf-stems (3–5 mm long) and their stipules (2.5–5 mm long, lanceolate) are hairy, but the stipules are much less so. Flowers Cotoneaster tenuipes goes into bloom from May to June. Its flowers are about 7 mm in diameter, and borne on corymbs of two to four flowers each. The slender pedicels (1–3 mm), rachis and hypanthium are villous and closely appressed, but hypanthium only abaxially. The bracts (2–4 mm long) are puberulous, linear or linear-lanceolate. The sepals (~1.2 mm long) are triangularly ovate, and the petals (~3–4 mm long and almost as broad) are white and stiff, ovate or suborbicular, and are clawed at their base, giving it its epithet tenuipes which equates roughly with \\"slender foot\\" or \\"slender claw\\". Each flower has 15 stamens, which are shorter than its petals, and 2 styles that are shorter than or equal to the stamens. The ovary is covered at the apex with very short, fine, erect hairs. Fruit Cotoneaster tenuipes bears its fruit from September to October. They are purplish black, ovoid pomes (~ 8.5 X 5.5 mm), each contains one or two pyrenas. Genetics The diploid chromosomal number for C. tenuipes is 68 (2n = 68).  Range and habitat  Cotoneaster tenuipes is found naturally in China, in the provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Tibet and Yunnan, in forested and dryer, rocky, montane slopes, at elevations between 1900 and 3100 meters high.

It is the only staffed weather station within an area of about and is situated mid-continent and near the core of the subtropical jetstream. This means it plays an important role as a weather and climate observatory for the country, particularly eastern and southeastern Australia, and particularly for rainfall predictions. The station is on the Great Central Road and the nearest township is the Warakurna Aboriginal settlement (population 180), North. Giles is within the Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku and is in the foothills of the Rawlinson Ranges. A staff of three operates the remote station on six-monthly tours. Giles Airport, a airstrip services the station and the Warakurna community. Tourists are invited to watch the daily release of weather balloons and browse through the Visitor's Centre. Station tours are no longer conducted on a regular basis. History Giles is named after English explorer Ernest Giles, the first European to travel through the area in 1874. Surveyor and roadbuilder Len Beadell, who worked for the Weapons Research Establishment (now known as the Defence Science and Technology Group), selected the site for a meteorological station in December 1955. It was needed to forecast weather conditions suitable for nuclear weapons testing at Emu Field and Maralinga. The location was strongly opposed by Walter MacDougall since it lay on tribal land. Beadell surveyed and built Giles Airport, and chose the name Giles during construction of the Gunbarrel Highway which links Carnegie Station and Giles. Beadell's grader, which is estimated to have travelled over in the course of making the roads, was retired in 1963 and is preserved on display at Giles. Later, the weather station provided support for rocket testing programs at Woomera, as Giles was close to the centre-line of fire from the launch site. Wreckage from the first Blue Streak missile, launched from Woomera on 5 June 1964, is on display at the station. Docker River, north-east and just across the state border in the Northern Territory, was established by the government as an aboriginal settlement for local people in the 1960s. Overcrowding there and at Warburton created a need for a new community which became Warakurna in the mid-1970s. In 1972 control of the station was transferred from the Department of Defence to the Bureau of Meteorology. A Landline story in 2018 stated that Giles would soon become the last mainland regional weather station to be permanently staffed, with all the others being automated. Climate Giles is in an area that has a desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is highly variable; recorded annual values have ranged from in 1961 to in 2001. The periodic southward movement of the monsoon trough and ex-tropical cyclones cause heavy rain events in the wetter months from November to March. Dry spells often occur, particularly in winter; the longest period without rain was 125 days from 17 May to 21 September 1961.

They form one of the larger Somali communities in Europe. Migration history From 1989 to 1998, the Netherlands was the second-most common European destination for Somali asylum- seekers, only slightly behind the United Kingdom and more than double the total of the next-most common destination, Denmark. However, between 2000 and 2005, there was a significant outflow of Somalis from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom, unofficially estimated to be as large as 20,000 people. Factors mentioned as driving forces behind the exodus included an increase in opposition to Muslim immigration, as exemplified by the rise of Pim Fortuyn, Somali opposition to housing policies which forced them to live scattered in small groups all over various cities rather than in a larger agglomerated community, a restrictive socio-economic environment which, among other things, made it difficult for new arrivals to find work, and the comparative ease of starting a business and acquiring the means to get off social welfare in the UK. Demography A branch of the Somali money transfer company Abesha Telecom (Libaan Telecom) in Rotterdam. , Statistics Netherlands estimated the following figures with respect to Dutch people of Somali origin: *15,281 persons of first-generation background (8,831 men, 6,850 women) *6,517 persons of second-generation background (3,322 men, 3,195 women), of which: **543 persons with one parent born in the Netherlands (273 men, 270 women) **5,974 persons with both parents born out of the Netherlands (3,049 men, 2,925 women) For a total of 21,798 persons (11,753 men, 10,045 women). This represented roughly 9% growth over the 1996 total of 20,060 persons; the composition of the population had changed slightly, with the proportion of the population of second-generation background more than doubling over that time frame.; the year 1996 is earliest for which data is available online The proportion of men has typically been greater than that of women. Most men are single without dependents, while most women are single mothers with one or more children. This is largely due to being only able to send certain family members to a different country.  Welfare benefits, education and unemployment  In 2005 according to the Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau annual report, Somalis are among the least educated and least integrated immigrants groups to the Netherlands together with Turks and Moroccans. Somali pupils have the lowest participation level in secondary education of all immigrant groups to the Netherlands, with less than 1 in 5. In 2012, Somalis had the by far highest unemployment rate at 37% of the labour force and 26% of the labour force was in work, counted as at least twelve hours per week. In 2015 more than half of all individuals with Somali background in the Netherlands received social welfare.

Gómez González (died 26 October 1111), called de Lara or de Candespina, was a Castilian nobleman and military leader who had some claim to being Count of Castile. He was the eldest son and successor of Gonzalo Salvadórez and his wife Sancha, and thus kinsman of the Lara family.Barton 1997, 251, provides a brief curriculum vitae of the count. Reilly 1988, 281, mistakenly makes him a son of Gonzalo Núñez de Lara. Like his father, he perished in battle. Gómez first appears in the record in 1084, a year after his father's death.Barton 1997, 251 n1. Reilly 1988, 275 n58, believes this to be based on a forgery. There exists a forged charter purporting to show Gómez, with the title Count, making a donation to the monastery of San Salvador de Oña in 1087. Donations to the same monastery by the same man, recorded in 1084, 1094, and 1099, are potentially authentic. It is unknown when he took a wife, but by 1107 he was married to a woman named Urraca Muñoz.Her son Rodrigo refers to her patronymic in a document of 1126, cf. Barton 1997, 251 n4 (Reilly 1988, 275, follows older tradition in making her daughter of Álvar Díaz, but the subsequent discovery of her patronymic makes this solution untenable). Recent work suggests that she was sister of count Rodrigo Muñoz and of Jimena Muñoz, the mistress of Alfonso VI (Canal Sánchez-Pagín 2003). She gave him two daughters and three sons: Diego, Stephanie (Estefanía), Rodrigo, Sancha and Gonzalo.Canal Sánchez-Pagín 2003, 53–58 After his death, she married Count Beltrán de Risnel.Canal Sánchez-Pagín 2003, 50. In 1090 he was given the government of the fiefdoms (tenencias) of Cerezo de Riotirón and Pancorbo, both of which he held until his death, and Petralata, which he held until 1106. By November 1092 Gómez had succeeded his own cousin, Pedro González, as royal alférez or armiger of Alfonso VI, a post he held until April 1099.Barton 1997, 251, and Reilly 1988, 275; but Reilly 1982, 281, makes Gómez alférez from as early as 1087, a change of opinion explained by Reilly 1988, 197 n32. By the beginning of 1099 he carried the high title of count (Latin comes), which was typically attained by a young nobleman after a stint as alférez.Reilly 1988, 275. In 1097 he briefly appears with the fief of Poza and towards the end of his life (1110) he held Avià. His most significant fief was the Bureba, an important frontier zone bordering Navarre, and which his father had held before him. He was granted it in 1102 and held it until 1107.The last reference to Gómez in the Bureba refers to him as dominante comite Gomez Gonsalvo Burebam (\\"count Gómez González ruling Bureba\\"), cf. Reilly 1982, 281 n8. In 1107 Gómez made an endowment to the parish church of Busto. In the summer of 1108, following the deaths of Raymond of Galicia (1107) and the heir apparent Sancho Alfónsez (at the Battle of Uclés in 1108, where Gómez may have been present), a marriage between Gómez and the new heir presumptive, Raymond's widow, Urraca, was proposed by a faction of bishops and nobles opposed to the king's plan to marry his heiress to Alfonso the Battler, the king of neighbouring Navarre and Aragon.Reilly 1982, 53. This proposal, with what motives behind it we do not know, is first recorded over a century later by Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada. At some point, perhaps as early as 1108,Reilly 1982, 56. The Crónicas anónimas de Sahagún gently inform us that \\"the noble count called Gómez, who at that time was living in Burgos with the queen, with a few went against them [the queen's enemies] in the field of Espina\\" (el noble conde llamado Gómez, el qual en aquella saçón morava en Burgos con la reina, con pocos en el campo del Espina fue contra ellos). The Chronica latina regum Castellae, I, §4, is similar: \\"The Castilians united with the count Gómez, called \\"of Candespina\\", who was excessively and more than appropriately familiar with the queen, and they fought against the king Alfonso together at Sepúlveda, where they were defeated by the king and the count died.\\" Gómez had an affair with Urraca that produced a son, Domingo Gómez, who was later to introduce the Premonstratensians into Spain when he founded a monastery at Montesacro c.1146, an establishment that was later moved by Alfonso VII to La Vid in 1152.Barton 1997, 197–98. Gómez was one of the magnates who witnessed the first recorded act of Urraca as queen, on 22 July 1109, and implicitly acknowledged her claim to have been granted \\"the whole kingdom\\" (regnum totum) by her father, Alfonso VI, shortly before his death.Urraca signed the document totius Yspanie regina (queen of all Spain), and she first put forward her claim about Alfonso's wishes in 1110; cf. Fletcher 1984, 127, who believes the surviving document to be the original. Among the other important persons who witnessed are to be found Bernard de Sedirac, Álvar Fáñez, Pedro Ansúrez, Fruela Díaz, and Pedro Fróilaz de Traba. This important document Gómez signed as castellanorum comes (literally, \\"count of the Castilians\\"),The form of title, as well as the spelling of his name and patronymic, could vary: Gomiz Gonsálbez comes castellanorum, Gumes Gundisaluez castelle comes (literally \\"count of Castile\\"), and Gumez Gunzaluiz castellanorum comes are all recorded, cf. Martínez Llorente 1994, 117 n114. a title he had sometimes used in royal charters of Alfonso VI but which was mostly honorific, as the old County of Castile had become the Kingdom of Castile and was partitioned into several counties, with Gómez's zone of influence lying along the Navarrese frontier. His frontier position may explain his own opposition to Urraca's marriage, since he would have competed with the Aragonese when it came to expansion (reconquista) south of the river Ebro at the expense of the Almoravids.Reilly 1982, 281, where he writes that, \\"as a magnate and official of the frontier, [Gómez's] own ambitions in the valley of the Ebro may well account for his hostility to the union with Aragón.\\" In early 1110, Gómez was present with Urraca and the king of Aragon at the Monastery of Nuestra Señora de Valvanera, where he confirmed a pair of donation charters drawn up in the Aragonese format. By the middle of the year he was openly supporting Urraca against her husband.Reilly 1982, 66 n71. The Aragonese documents call him Gomessanus comes Pont Corvum et Ceresum and ruling in Pontecorbo et in Cereso. Though he is last mentioned in a document of 15 October 1110, he was killed over a year later by Henry of Portugal, who had allied with the king of Aragon, at the Battle of Candespina, where he was leading Urraca's forces, on 26 October 1111. His death was a major blow to the queen's partisans. The short account of the battle in the Annales complutenses reads: \\"the Aragonese king Alfonso and count Henry killed the lord count Gómez in the field of Spina.\\"Quoted in Reilly 1982, 74 n100: { :Era MCXLVIIII, VII kal. novembr. rex Adefonsus aragonensis et comes Enricus occiderunt comitem domno Gomez in campo de Spina. :Era 1049 [AD 1111], 7th Kalends of November [26 October]. King Alfonso of Aragon and count Henry killed count Don Gómez in the field of Spina. |} An even shorter account in the Annales compostellani states simply that \\"they\\" killed count Gómez.Quoted in Reilly 1982, 74 n100: Era MCXLIX occiderunt comitem Gometium (\\"Era 1049 they killed count Gómez\\"). Gómez was succeeded as Urraca's lover by his kinsman Pedro González de Lara.Reilly 1982, 282. Pedro, along with Rodrigo González de Lara, were sons of count Gonzalo Núñez de Lara, in turn believed to have been first-cousin of Gonzalo Salvadórez according to recent genealogical reconstructions.

Corynne Barron Corynne Barron 18, from Edmonton, Alberta is a classical contemporary dancer. Corynne has a pretty athletic background, including ringette, soccer, and track & field (hurdles). She believes that the 8–10 hours of daily dancing she did in England last year has prepped her for this competition. She was eliminated in Week 5. Nicolas Begin Nicolas Begin 24, from Quebec City, Quebec is a b-boy/hip hop dancer. Nicolas identifies with Miles Faber from Season 1 as a B-Boy and says that he'll bring tons of energy to the show. He's nervous about being on TV, but his dream job is performing with a big artist like Justin Timberlake. He was eliminated in week 3. He, along with season one finalist Vincent Noiseux, was runner-up with Blueprint Cru on season 5 of America's Best Dance Crew. Cody Bonnell Cody Bonnell 19, from Unionville, Ontario is a hip hop dancer. Cody owns over 50 pairs of shoes. He wore his favorite pair to the Montreal audition: Kanye West-designed sneakers. He's also trained in tap, jazz, and ballet, and used to play hockey. He was eliminated in week 7. Melanie Buttarazzi Melanie Buttarazzi 22, from Woodbridge, Ontario is a Latin/ballroom dancer. Aside from her dance training, Melanie has been studying kinesiology, which helps her understand how her body works. She says she's always been the underdog and is excited to show Canada how hard she can work and that she can be the best. She was eliminated in week 2. Jayme Rae Dailey Jayme Rae Dailey 21, from Montreal, Quebec is a contemporary dancer. She has a twin sister so she says it will be weird being without her during the competition, since they generally do everything together. She says she's got a “spicy flavor” and looks forward to bringing it to the stage. To prepare, she's been taking as many classes as she can in as many genres as she can. It helps that her dad built her and her sister a studio in the basement. Vincent Desjardins Vincent Desjardins 20, from Trois-Rivières, Quebec is a ballroom dancer. Vincent owes a lot to his sister as he wouldn't have been a dancer if it was not for her. He's performed in ballroom competitions in several major cities and his family is super important to him as a support network. His motto is “Dream to catch the sun - worse comes to worst, you’ll catch a star.” His favorite dance movie is Dance with Me. Austin Di Iulio Austin Di Iulio 19, from Mississauga, Ontario is a contemporary dancer. Although he has come in as a contemporary dancer, he is looking forward to hip hop and nervous about learning ballroom. He plays soccer and is also studying to be an aerospace engineer.

The syndrome has a number of possible symptoms and can, more rarely, affect the skin, bones, kidneys, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. When the syndrome affects the brain, people can experience severe headaches, seizures, acute stroke, meningism, and progressive neurological deficits due to acute or chronic ischaemia caused by arteriovenous shunting. In the retina, the syndrome causes retinocephalic vascular malformations that tend to be present with intracranial hemorrhage and lead to decreased visual acuity, proptosis, pupillary defects, optic atrophy, congestion of bulbar conjunctiva, and visual field defects. Retinal lesions can be unilateral and tortuous, and symptoms begin to appear in the second and third decades of life. The syndrome can present with cutaneous lesions, or skin with different texture, thickness, and color, usually on the face. The facial features caused by the syndrome vary from slight discoloration to extensive nevi and angiomas of the skin. In some cases, the frontal and maxillary sinus may also be affected. There have only been 52 reported cases of patients with Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome as of 2012. Symptoms are rarely noticed in children and the syndrome is often diagnosed in late childhood or early adulthood when visual impairment is noticed. Fluorescein angiography is commonly used to diagnose the syndrome. There have been several methods in treating patients with Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome. However, the optimal treatment is uncertain. Patients with intracranial lesions have been treated with surgical intervention and in some cases, this procedure has been successful. Other treatments include embolization, radiation therapy, and continued observation. With limited research on Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome, researchers have focused on the clinical and radiological findings rather than how to manage this rare and non-heritable syndrome.  Signs and symptoms  Left eye showing proptosis. Typically not diagnosed until late childhood or later, Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome usually presents itself with a combination of central nervous system features (midbrain), ophthalmic features (retina), and facial features. The degree of expression of the syndrome's components varies both clinically and structurally. Common symptoms that lead to diagnosis are headaches, retro-orbital pain, and hemianopia. Visual field of homonymous hemianopia The ophthalmic features of Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome occur as retinal arteriovenous malformation (AVMs). There are three categories of AVMs based on their severity. The first category consists of the patient having small lesions that usually are asymptomatic. The second category, more severe than the first, is when the patient's malformation is missing a connecting capillary between an artery and a vein; without it, edema, hemorrhage, and visual impairment can result. Category three refers to malformations so severe that their dilated vessels no longer distinguish between artery and vein, and the patient has a significantly increased risk of vision loss. Since the retinal lesions categorized vary from large vascular malformations that affect a majority of the retina to malformations that are barely visible, the lesions can cause a wide range of symptoms, including decrease in visual sharpness, proptosis, pupillary defects, optic nerve degeneration, and visual field defects. The most common type of visual field impairment due to AVMs is homonymous hemianopia, which is usually unilateral. Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms of Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome are highly dependent on the locations and sizes of cerebral AVMs. The most common CNS feature is an intracranial hemangioma in the midbrain. Cerebral malformations can result in severe headaches, cerebral hemorrhages, vomiting, meningism, seizures, acute strokes, and progressive neurological deficits due to acute or chronic ischaemia caused by arteriovenous shunting. The facial features of Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome vary from case to case. A person showing signs of the syndrome may display faint skin discoloration, nevi, or angiomas of the skin. Some patients with this disorder also present with high-flow AVMs in the maxillofacial or mandibular (jaw) regions. Another facial indicator of this disease is malformations affecting the frontal or maxillary sinuses.  Causes  Fluorescein angiography can reveal arteriovenous malformations. Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome results from arteriovenous malformations. The exact cause of this disorder is unknown, and no specific genetic abnormality has been identified. The syndrome is a congenital disorder that begins to develop around the seventh week of gestation when the maturation of retinal mesenchymal cells do not grow properly. The abnormal development of vascular tissue leads to arteriovenous malformations, which affect both visual and cerebral structures.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis commonly occurs later in childhood and often occurs incidentally in asymptomatic patients or as a cause of visual impairment. The first symptoms are commonly found during routine vision screenings. A number of examinations can be used to determine the extent of the syndrome and its severity. Fluorescein angiography is quite useful in diagnosing retinal features of the disease, and the use of ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are helpful in confirming the disease. Neuro-ophthalmic examinations reveal pupillary defects (e.g. Marcus Gunn Pupil). Funduscopic examinations, examinations of the fundus of the eye, allow detection of arteriovenous malformations. Neurological examination can determine neurological deficits such as hemiparesis and paresthesias. MRI scans are used in imaging the brain and can allow visualization of the optic nerve and any possible atrophy. MRI, CT, and cerebral angiography may all be used to investigate the extent and location of any vascular lesions affecting the brain. This is helpful in determining the extent of the syndrome.  Treatment  The treatment for Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome is controversial due to a lack of consensus on the different therapeutic procedures for treating arteriovenous malformations. The first successful treatment was performed by Morgan et al., who combined intracranial resection, ligation of the ophthalmic artery, and selective arterial ligature of the external carotid artery. Notably, the patient did not have retinal vascular malformations. Lesions are watched closely for changes in size. Prognosis is best when lesions are less than 3 cm in length. Most complications occur when the lesions are greater than 6 cm in size. Surgical intervention for intracranial lesions has been done successfully. Nonsurgical treatments include embolization, radiation therapy, and continued observation. When pursuing treatment, it is important to consider the size of the malformations, their locations, and neurological involvement. Because it is a congenital disorder, there are no preventative steps to take aside from regular follow-ups with a doctor to monitor symptoms so that future complications are avoided.  Epidemiology  The syndrome was first described in 1943 and believed to be associated with racemose hemangiomatosis of the retina and arteriovenous malformations of the brain. It is non-hereditary and considered a phakomatosis but rarely involves the skin.

In January 2009, Sycamore initiated a public postering project called Lostmissing, which she describes as: Sycamore opposed the push among the LGBT movement for same-sex marriage, arguing that it distracts from more pressing issues like the securing of universal health care and housing security for all.UTNE Reader, November–December 2008. Sycamore also opposed the LGBT movement's focus on inclusion in the US military, arguing instead that the movement should be focused on opposing the harmful impacts of the military at home and abroad. In 2010, she appeared on Democracy Now! in the segment Does Opposing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” Bolster US Militarism? A Debate with Lt. Dan Choi and Queer Activist Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, and later penned op-eds against trans inclusion in the military in Truthout and The Baffler.

NPR's Book Concierge included Sketchtasy on its list of the Best Books of 2018. Personal life Regarding gender identity, Sycamore identifies as genderqueer and uses the pronouns 'she' and 'her'. She has described herself as, \\"A genderqueer, faggot, and a queen, on the trans continuum, in a gender bending, gender blur kind of place. But the words I relate to the most are probably 'faggot' and 'queen.' 'Queer' would be more of a broader political identity.\\"  Bibliography   Novels  *Sketchtasy Vancouver, BC: Arsenal Pulp Press, 2018. , *So Many Ways to Sleep Badly San Francisco : City Lights Books, 2008. , *Pulling Taffy San Francisco, Calif. : Suspect Thoughts, 2004. ,  Memoir  *The End of San Francisco San Francisco : City Lights, 2013. ,  Nonfiction Anthologies  *Why Are Faggots So Afraid of Faggots?

In 2013, she was named editor of TAB: The Journal of Poetry & Poetics. Career Leahy's poetry and nonfiction have won citations for their “lucid and beautiful consideration of what is means at the physical level to be human and to be whole.” Her first chapbook Hagioscope won the Sow's Ear Press Competition in 2000, and her first full- length, Constituents of Matter won the Wick Poetry Prize from Kent State University in 2006. In 2016, her essays won top prizes from both Ninth Letter and Dogwood, and have been listed among the Notables in The Best American Essays of 2013, 2016, and 2017. Leahy's poetry draws from concepts and terminology of science. Constituents of Matter was reviewed favorably in The Women's Review of Books among others, citing the effective use of scientific and logical systems such as game theory and the scientific method as “metaphors and models to characterize what is unseen”. Aperture, Deborah Hauser writes, is “five tightly structured sections and a coda [which] shine a spotlight on the lives of women as diverse as the mothers left behind in The Wizard of Oz, Mary Todd Lincoln, Lizzie Siddal (photographer’s model), and Katherine Johnson (NASA mathematician).” Eileen Murphy contends the \\"poems are varied, thoughtful, and often ironic or humorous . . . the reader looks through the mind-opening with the poet as guide, listens to unique women’s voices, revels in them, learns from them, is haunted by them.\\" Leahy's nonfiction books include Tumor in the Object Lessons series from Bloomsbury Publishing, and Conversing with Cancer with Lisa Sparks. From 2010 to 2017, she co-authored a blog with Douglas R. Dechow, Lofty Ambitions, about aviation and space, which culminated in a visiting fellowship at the American Library in Paris in fall 2016 and Generation Space: A Love Story, which follows the end of the Space Shuttle program. In 2016, she edited and co-wrote What We Talk about When We Talk about Creative Writing, a collaborative exploration of teaching and academia with 32 contributors in more than a dozen conversation essays. In 2005, she edited Power and Identity in the Creative Writing Classroom, which was reviewed by Pedagogy in terms of creating a new paradigm for teaching creative writing at the college and university level. The reviewer found that by examining new ways to teach as presented in Leahy's book, creative writing professors can make better decisions about their own classrooms. In 2010, Leahy contributed to Does the Writing Workshop Still Work?, which was reviewed by Pedagogy and called \\"an enlightening read for both critics and supporters of the workshop.\\" Her essays on teaching creative writing are included in Hippo Reads and The Handbook of Creative Writing, as well as critical work for Curator, The Journal of the Midwest MLA, The Journal of Creative Writing Studies, The Companion to the American Short Story, and the Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century. A native of Illinois, Leahy is the daughter of Mary Lee Leahy, whom the Chicago Tribune called \\"a pioneering lawyer,\\" and Andrew Leahy.

Abadilla (March 10, 1906 – August 26, 1969), commonly known as AGA, was a Filipino poet, essayist and fiction writer. Critic Pedro Ricarte referred to Abadilla as the father of modern Philippine poetry, and was known for challenging established forms and literature's \\"excessive romanticism and emphasis on rhyme and meter\\". Abadilla helped found the Kapisanang Panitikan in 1935 and edited a magazine called Panitikan. His Ako ang Daigdig collection of poems is one of his better known works. Early life Abadilla was born to an average Filipino family on March 10, 1906, in Salinas, Rosario, Cavite. He finished elementary school at Sapa Barrio School, then continued for high school education in Cavite City. After graduation, he went abroad and worked for a small printing shop in Seattle, Washington. He edited several section of the Philippine Digest, Philippines-American Review and established Kapisanang Balagtas (Balagtas' Organization). In 1934, he returned to the Philippines where he finished AB Philosophy at the University of Santo Tomas. Until 1934, he became municipal councilor of Salinas before shifting to an insurance selling job. Major works Aside from writing Ako ang Daigdig, Abadilla wrote several poems and compilation of his works: * Mga Kuwentong Ginto (Golden Stories) – he co-edited with Clodualdo del Mundo. * Mga Piling Katha: Ang Maikling Kathang Tagalog (Chosen Works: An Anthology of Short Stories in Tagalog) – he co-edited with F.B. Sebastian and A.D.G. Mariano. * Maiikling Katha (Short Stories) – together with Commission on Filipino Language head Ponciano B.P. Pineda. * Mga Piling Sanaysay (Several Essays). * Parnasong Tagalog: Katipunan ng mga piling tula mula kina Huseng Sisiw at Balagtas hanggang sa kasalukuyang panahon ng pamumulaklak at pagkaunlad (Tagalog Works: Compilation of Poems from Huseng Sisiw through Francisco Balagtas until Present Times of Flourishing Philippine Poetry). * Ako ang Daigdig at Iba pang mga Tula (I am the World and Other Poems). * Tanagabadilla, Una at Ikalawang Aklat (Tanagabadilla: First and Second Books)- compilation of Abadilla's tanagas. In Filipino poetry, a tanaga is a short poem of one stanza with 7-7-7-7 syllabic verse, with an AAAA rhyme scheme. Usually, a tanaga is embedded with symbols. Tanagabadilla is a coined term consisting of tanaga and Abadilla. * Pagkamulat Ako ang Daigdig According to Pedro Ricarte,http://panitikan.com.ph/authors/a/agabadilla.htm Abadilla's major breakthrough in Philippine poetry was when he wrote the poem \\"Ako ang Daigdig\\" (\\"I Am the World\\") in 1955. Initially, poetry critics rejected the poem since it does not follow the traditional poetry that uses rhyme and meter. In the poem, the repetition of the words ako (I), daigdig (world) and tula (poem) leaves an impression that the poet, Abadilla, is not himself. The speaker of the poem says that he himself, his world of poem and his poems are united as one.,. References * Panitikan.com: Alejandro G.

The sculpture escaped mention in any classical writer. It is judged to have been a late work in the sculptor's career,Andrew F. Stewart, Skopas of Paros (1977) ch. 9, places it with his Pothos; Stewart's monograph, the modern standard, had its origins in his thesis. but it is known only through a number of copies that vary in quality and in fidelity to the original,Stewart 1977 Appendix 4 lists known copies and fragments. which show it to have been one of the famous sculptures of antiquity: \\"the popularity of the Meleager during Roman times was certainly great,\\" notes Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway,Ridgway, Hellenistic Sculpture I: Styles Of Ca. 331-200 B.C. (University of Wisconsin Press) 2001:87f. who reports Andrew F. Stewart's count of 13 statues, 4 torsos, 19 heads (which are similar enough to the Ludovisi Ares to raise confusions) busts and herms, a variant with changed stance and attributes, and 11 versions adapted for a portrait or a deity. Six or seven of the accepted copies are accompanied by a dog, 12 wear a chlamys, 3, clinching the sculptural type's identification with Meleager, are accompanied by a boar's head trophy, as in the Vatican Meleager (illustration, right). Ms Ridgeway accounts for the sculpture's popularity in part \\"by the appeal that hunting figures had for the Romans, through their heroizing connotations.\\"Ridgeway 2001:88. Meleager, after Skopas (British MuseumGR 1906.1-17.1; the bust is modern, made to support the ancient head, a Roman copy after Skopas) A torso in the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University,Bequest of Mrs K.G.T. Webster, acc. no. 1926.48; the sculpture is actually conserved in the Sackler Museum is rated among the superior copies, if it is indeed a Meleager.Stewart 1977:104ff raised the possibility that the Fogg torso instead represented a copy of one of two types of Skopas' Aesculapius, noticed by Pausanias in the second century CE, and Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway (2001:88) noticed the remains of a staff under the left armpit, where the spear associated with representations of Meleager would pierce the youth's skin or else be dulled against the ground, she remarked. \\"There are other marble Meleagers,\\" wrote Cornelius Vermeule in 1967,Vermeule, \\"Greek Sculpture and Roman Taste\\", Boston Museum Bulletin 65 No. 342 (1967:175-192) p. 175 \\"one or two reaching the level of the Fogg statueVermeule illustrates (fig. 2) a battered mirror-image head of the Meleager, also at the Fogg, of poorer quality. but most of them documents of stonecutting devoid of the restless inner life that must have been imparted by the master to the original.\\" Several unfinished copies found in Athens suggest that the city was a center for reproductions for the Roman market.Vermeule 1967:175 note 3. It is not known whether Skopas' original was carried out for the heroon at Calydon where Meleager was venerated and whether the original was carried off as a cultural trophy by one of the Romans \\"of taste and means\\".Vermeule 1967:175 The lifesize standing Meleager from Palazzo Fusconi-Pighini (illustration, right), sometimes identified in the 16th and 17th centuries as an Adonis, who was a victim of a boar rather than its master, was recorded in 1546 among the most beautiful in Rome, not excluding the antiquities of the Cortile del Belvedere; it was in the house of the doctor to three popes, Francesco Fusconi from Norcia, whose Roman palazzo faced Palazzo Farnese.Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: the lure of classical sculpture, 1500-1900 (Yale University Press) 1982:263, cat. no. 60. The sculpture, which was engraved in all the anthologies of antiquities, was copied by Pierre Lepautre for Louis XIV at Marly. The original remained with Fusconi's eventual Pighini heirs until early in 1770, when it was purchased by Pope Clement XIV as one of the founding pieces for his new museum in the Vatican. It was among the select group of sculptures triumphantly removed by Napoleon to Paris, under terms of the Treaty of Tolentino (1797) but returned after Napoleon's fall. A variant, discovered in 1838, has been conserved in the Antikensammlung BerlinIllustration since 1844. Another early Roman full-size marble copy is at the Art Institute of Chicago.Acc. no. 1972.935, height 173 cm (68-5/16 in.) gift of Mr. and Mrs. Eugene A. Davidson. Ms Ridgeway remarks critically on the slenderness of the connection with Skopas, which is based on the subject of the east pediment of the Temple of Athena Alea at Tegea, in which Skopas was the architect, but not, as Ms Ridgeway observes, accounted directly responsible for the pediment sculptures in any classical reference: \\"from a narrative pedimental composition in Arkadia— related, moreover, to local families and legends— to a single free-standing sculpture, perhaps in Kalydon (a tomb monument to the hero, as suggested by Stewart?) is quite a leap of the imagination.\\"Ridgeway 2001:89.

He served as Bishop of Camden from 1957 until his death in 1959. Biography Justin McCarthy was born in Sayre, Pennsylvania, to Joseph and Delia (née Regan) McCarthy. He and his family later moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he attended St. Mary of the Assumption School. He studied at Seton Hall University in South Orange, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts (1923) and Master of Arts (1925). He then furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical North American College and the Pontifical Urbaniana University. While in Rome, McCarthy was ordained to the priesthood on April 16, 1927. He earned his Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Propaganda that year as well. Upon his return to New Jersey in 1927, he served as professor of Sacred Scripture and homiletics at Immaculate Conception Seminary until 1941, when he became spiritual director and professor of ascetical theology. He was raised to the rank of a Papal Chamberlain in May 1941 and later a Domestic Prelate in December 1949. In 1953 he was named pastor of Our Lady of Sorrows Church in South Orange. He also served as director of the Priests' Eucharistic League and the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine. On March 27, 1954, McCarthy was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Newark and Titular Bishop of Doberus by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 11 from Archbishop Thomas Aloysius Boland, with Bishops Bartholomew J. Eustace and James A. McNulty serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart. Following the death of Bishop Eustace in December 1956, McCarthy was named the second Bishop of Camden on January 27, 1957. He was installed at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on March 19, 1957. During his relatively short tenure, McCarthy made Catholic education his primary concern. He opened several new schools and expanded already existing ones, making room for an increase of over 5,000 students at the elementary level and 1,000 students at the high school level. At the time of his death, some 20,000 children were enrolled in CCD classes, nearly a 100 percent increase since his installation. McCarthy was also dedicated to the welfare of the increasing Hispanic population in the diocese. He sent some clergy to Puerto Rico in order for Spanish-speaking Catholics to be served in their native language. In 1957 he opened a Mobile Chapel for migrant workers, and in 1959 secured the services of four Oblates of the Sacred Heart Sisters to teach religion and do social work at Our Lady of Fatima Church in Camden. He also erected four new parishes, founded a diocesan commission on properties and buildings, and encouraged a Catholic Youth Council be established at every parish in the diocese. McCarthy died from a heart attack at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, Elizabeth, New Jersey, aged 59. He is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Cherry Hill.

The school opened on September 6, 1960, and is named after John Marshall, the fourth Chief Justice of the United States.\\"School Bells Ring Again; Record Enrollments Expected\\". The Oregonian, September 6, 1960, p. 29. The school was closed in 2011 as the Portland Public Schools district moved to consolidate students and resources into fewer high schools.  History  Marshall was built to accommodate 2,400 students, although only 1300 enrolled in its first year. It cost $4,731,506 to build, and included 42 classrooms. It had a library, which projects from a corner of the building into the courtyard, had 7000 books in its first year, and a cafeteria which seated 800 students. Students were drawn from areas previously served by Franklin and Madison High Schools. Marshall was designed by the firm Stanton, Boles, Maguire, and Church, which also designed the campus of Lewis and Clark College. Marshall had several innovative design features. It was designed to have conference rooms connected to classrooms, with windows between them, to allow teachers to either meet with individual students while keeping an eye on the class as a whole or let students study in the conference room while teaching a class in the main classroom. It put lockers in all teachers classrooms, for storing personal belongings. Despite these design features, it is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, since, unlike Jackson Middle School and Wilson High School, it does not demonstrate as high a level of innovation in its design. In the mid 1960s, Marshall experimented with an innovative program, developed by a team of professors at the Stanford School of Education, which gave students the opportunity to complete homework during an extended school day. This program structured the school more like a college, to better prepare students for college. Students spent just two thirds of their day in class, leaving the other third open for studying, researching, or sitting in on other classes. Classes also varied in length, resulting in a complicated schedule based upon 20-minute modules, which was created by an IBM 7090. While the reaction was generally positive, there were some problems with the experiment. Not all teachers adjusted well to the student-discussion focused classes, and some students goofed off instead of studying during the free third of their school day. The school encouraged collaboration between teachers, which many saw as positive. Student profile In its last year of operation, the student population was 45% white, 23% Latino, 16% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 10% African American. The Marshall boundaries contained more potential students (1640) than any other in the Portland area, though the Marshall enrollment was only 751 students. In 2009, 9% of the students transferred into the school. Academics Since 2004, Marshall comprised four small schools: the BizTech High School of Business and Technology, the Portland Academy of International Studies, the Linus Pauling \\"Academy of Integrated Sciences\\", and the Renaissance Arts Academy. *BizTech High School of Business and Technology In 2008, 42% of the school's seniors received their high school diploma. Of 62 students, 26 graduated, 23 dropped out, 4 received a modified diploma, and 9 were still in high school. In 2009–2010, the school had 288 students. *Pauling Academy of Integrated Sciences In 2008, 58% of the school's seniors received their high school diploma. Of 71 students, 41 graduated, 20 dropped out, 5 received a modified diploma, and 5 were still in high school. In 2009–2010, the school had 175 students. *Renaissance Arts Academy In 2008, 44% of the school's seniors received their high school diploma. Of 61 students, 27 graduated, 22 dropped out, 7 received a modified diploma, and 5 were still in high school. In 2009–2010, the school had 288 students. Athletics Among Marshall's most successful sports teams were the boys basketball teams (reaching the postseason in 2009-10) also the 1995-96 basketball team almost reach the post season they were one game shy of making the post season. And the cheerleading squad (which finished 4th in Oregon in 2009-10). The girls basketball team won two consecutive state championships in 1981 and 1982. Coached by Ken Trapp and John Hughes, the 1981 championship team was the first in Oregon history to finish undefeated at 26-0. Coached by Rod Jones, the girls volleyball team won the state championship in 1978 and finished second in 1982, 1985 and in 1987 second under coach John Hughes. In 1980 the girls soccer team reached the quarter finals. In 1981 the softball team finished 3rd in the state. Marshall football reached the state quarterfinals in 1973, and last reached the playoffs since 2003, but hadn't won a playoff football game since 1990. The school recorded the first winless season in the school's 50-year history during the 2007-2008 season after falling in the last game of the season to also winless Roosevelt High School 25-22 in a match-up of two teams that have struggled for the better part of the decade.

Franklin, Grant, Madison, and Benson remodel The Marshall Campus housed the students of Franklin High school from the fall of 2015 until the end of the school year in 2017 while Franklin High School was renovated and earthquake-proofed. In fall 2017, the students of Grant High School relocated to the Marshall Campus while similar renovation is done on the Grant building. Students are expected to return to the building in fall 2019. After Grant High School completed, Madison High School was transferred to be at Marshall campus for 2 years so they have a fully renovated building just like Grant and Franklin High Schools. After the Madison completion, Benson Polytechnic High School students will be the next to use the Marshall campus, as their school undergoes major renovations from 2021-2024. https://www.pps.net/Page/1838 References Category:High schools in Portland, Oregon Category:Defunct schools in Oregon Category:1960 establishments in Oregon Category:2011 disestablishments in Oregon Category:Portland Public Schools (Oregon) ","title":"Marshall High School (Portland, Oregon)"},{"id":"24162182","text":"A Million Bid is a 1927 silent drama film directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Dolores Costello.

The Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark straddles the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is centred on the Marble Arch Caves and in 2001 it became one of the first geoparks to be designated in Europe. The Geopark features various sites which demonstrate the geological and wider natural heritage of the area, as well as the cultural heritage relating to 7,000–8,000 years of recorded human occupation since the last ice age. It is jointly managed by Fermanagh and Omagh District Council and Cavan County Council.  Geography  The Geopark consists of over 30 discrete areas of land, largely in public ownership across County Fermanagh and neighbouring parts of Cavan between Pettigo and Belleek in the north and west and the town of Cavan in the southeast. Most extensive of these are the Cuilcagh Mountain Park, along with the forests of Ballintempo, Belmore, Tullychurry, Lough Navar, Conagher and Big Dog, each of which are managed by the Forest Service Northern Ireland. Cuilcagh Mountain, with Upper Lough Macnean in the foreground. A number of national nature reserves and other natural and historic sites and viewpoints also fall within the designated area, the distribution of which has been likened to an archipelago. There are particular concentrations of geopark sites around both Lower Lough Erne and south of Belcoo. The Breifne Mountains straddle the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, a few miles southwest of Enniskillen. Cuilcagh itself attains a height of . The Sruh Croppa, Owenbrean and Aghinrawn rivers flowing on the northern flanks of Cuilcagh Mountain sink underground on reaching the limestone outcrop, combining underground to form the Cladagh River which emerges at a natural rock bridge known as the Marble Arch. Much of the rest of the Geopark comprises parts of the range of hills stretching between Belmore Mountain, which peaks at , and the Cliffs of Magho overlooking the western reaches of Lower Lough Erne.European Geoparks published in 2008 by Natural History Museum of the Lesvos Petrified Forest  Geology  The Geopark is almost wholly formed in sedimentary bedrock dating from the Carboniferous Period. These are a suite of faulted and gently folded sandstones, mudstones and limestones assigned to the Visean and Namurian stages of the period. There are however a few areas where older rocks are to be found. The larger part of the Geopark is covered by thick glacial deposits which obscure the bedrock geology across much of the lower ground. Pre-Carboniferous strata The oldest rocks within the Geopark are quartzo-feldspathic gneisses found to the northwest of Lower Lough Erne. They originated as marine sandstones and were metamorphosed during the Caledonian Orogeny. Further east around Tappaghan Mountain and Lack are a suite of schists, phyllites and marble ascribed to the Dalradian Supergroup. Greywackes, shales, sandstones and conglomerates of Ordovician age are found around the margins of the southern extent of the Geopark at Cavan and Butlers Bridge and between Lismoren and Killashandra. This outcrop is intruded by the Crossdoney granite emplaced during the Silurian period. Also of Silurian age is a small outcrop of turbidites at Lisbellaw. An area around Lisnarick and Irvinestown is underlain by Old Red Sandstone; these early Devonian age sandstones, mudstones and siltstones extend to the shores of Lower Lough Erne though, as elsewhere across the lower lying ground of the area, are largely obscured by much younger superficial deposits.Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark; Exploring the landscape of Fermanagh and Cavan (map), 2015 GSNI Carboniferous strata The Carboniferous strata consists of numerous recognised formations which are assembled into an underlying (older) Tyrone Group and an overlying (therefore younger) Leitrim Group. The Marble Arch Caves are developed in the Asbian-age Glencar Limestone Formation and the Knockmore Limestone Member of the overlying Dartry Limestone Formation. Cuilcagh Mountain and the hills to its northwest are largely made up of rocks of the Asbian/Brigantian age Glenade Sandstone Formation, the Brigantian/Pendleian-age Dergvone and Carraun Shale Formations, the Pendleian- age Briscloonagh Sandstone Formation and the Arnsbergian-age Bencroy Shale, Lackagh Sandstone and Gowlaun Shale Formations. Palaeogene intrusions Many of these formations are heavily faulted. Those at Cuilcagh are intruded by the WNW–SSE-oriented Cuilcagh Dyke – one of several Palaeogene age vertical intrusions of dolerite in the area whilst a dolerite sill intrudes into the area to the west of Conagher Forest. Quaternary The limestone formations have given rise to Northern Ireland's finest karst landscape. The caves themselves are of unknown age but date back in part over 380,000 years. The area was subject to repeated glaciation during the Quaternary period. The most recent ice age, the Midlandian or Devensian, has left a spread of glacial erratics across the landscape. Erratics at Cavan Burren Park feature in an interpretive trail at this locality. The larger part of the Geopark is covered by a huge swarm of drumlins, the alignment of which reflect the passage of ice broadly from east to west though in a southerly direction south of Upper Lough Erne. They formed under an icesheet in excess of 1000m thick at the height of the ice age. The distinctive landscape of Upper Lough Erne and the southern stretch of Lower Lough Erne results from the partial drowning of numerous drumlins in the post-glacial period.  Protected areas  There are several National Nature Reserves within the Geopark, including those of Correl Glen, Hanging Rock, Cladagh Glen and Killykeegan. Some of the blanket bog on Cuilcagh Mountain is protected as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the European Union's Habitats Directive and as a Ramsar site designated under the Ramsar Convention. Blanket bog near Florencecourt, on the foothills of Cuilcagh mountain.  Principal attractions  * Marble Arch Caves are a major draw for visitors in Northern Ireland and these show caves exhibit a wide range of classic cave features which are enjoyed by visitors by boat and on foot. * The Cavan Burren Park is an area of forestry land near Blacklion in County Cavan, which contains a wealth of prehistoric monuments linked by trails, with a visitors' centre providing interpretation of the features. These include the Calf House or Druid's Altar, a fine example of a portal tomb or dolmen dating from Neolithic times, and the nearby Giant's Leap wedge tomb. * Shannon Pot is a natural feature which is considered to be the source of Ireland's longest river, the Shannon. It has rich mythological associations, not least the story of Sionnan, granddaughter of the Celtic sea-god Lir, who came to this spot in search of the great Salmon of Wisdom. * There are a number of castles and historic buildings in the Geopark, now largely in ruins. These include Castle Caldwell, Tully Castle, Monea Castle, Drumlane Abbey and Enniskillen Castle, of which the latter is refurbished and contains a museum. Tully Castle in 2006. * Devenish Island is a registered ancient monastic site in Lower Lough Erne which is accessible by boat. * Boa Island is on situated off the northern shore of Lower Lough Erne and is accessible by road. It contains important scheduled monuments related to early Christianity.  History  The Marble Arch Caves were first explored in 1895 by the French speleologist Édouard-Alfred Martel together with naturalist Lyster Jameson. During the following 70 years, members of the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club and other speleological organisations made further explorations of the system. Fermanagh District Council began to consider developing a show cave at the site and they eventually opened them to the public in 1985. The nearby Cuilcagh Mountain Park was opened in 1998. The two areas became one of the first European geoparks in 2001 and gained the status of global geopark in 2004 following the Madonie Agreement between UNESCO and the European Geoparks Network. In 2007 the geopark was extended to cover many thousands of hectares of afforested upland to the north west of Cuilcagh Mountain, and in September 2008 it became the world's first transnational geopark in the European and Global Geoparks Networks as it was extended across the international border into County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland.  Events  The Geopark promotes walks and events of various sorts to interpret its attractions both to local people and visitors. These include a celebration of European Geoparks Week which takes place at the end of May – start of June, coinciding with similar events in geoparks across Europe.

Architect Sidney Eisenshtat designed the current synagogue building, constructed in 1956 and expanded in 1998. Since 1997, the senior rabbi has been David Wolpe, the Rabbi Emeritus has been Zvi Dershowitz, and since 2008, the head school rabbi has been Andrew Feig. History Begun in 1906, Sinai Temple was established as the first Conservative congregation in Southern California. Its founders saw it as a venue for the practice of traditional Judaism in an environment of assimilation. The congregation first met in a B'nai B'rith hall on Figueroa Street in downtown Los Angeles, then from 1909 to 1925 in a building at 12th and Valencia, just west of what is now the Los Angeles Convention Center. That building then became the Welsh Presbyterian Church, and was named a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1977. (In 2013, Jewish music impresario Craig Taubman bought the building and announced plans to convert it into \\"a multicultural and interfaith performing arts center and house of worship.\\")Ryan Torok. \\"Finding holy ground in Pico-Union\\", The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, February 6, 2013. Having outgrown this facility, the congregation relocated to the mid-Wilshire district in 1925. This second building, located at 4th and New Hampshire, is now a Korean Presbyterian church. Following the trend of its congregants, who were moving in significant numbers to Beverly Hills and the Westside of Los Angeles, in 1956, Sinai Temple constructed its third facility at its current location at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Beverly Glen Boulevard in Westwood. The building has a striking interior marked by the use of stained glass; Eisenshtat's design has been compared to the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. The building was expanded in 1998, under the supervision of architect Mehrdad Yazdani and Dworsky Associates. In 1986, Akiba Academy, which had rented facilities for its kindergarten through eighth grade program at Sinai Temple since its inception in 1968, merged with Sinai Temple and became known as Sinai Akiba Academy. The school is affiliated with the Solomon Schechter Day School Association and is the longest-accredited Jewish day school in the California Association of Independent School. Sinai Temple owns and operates Mount Sinai Memorial Parks and Mortuaries, a large Jewish cemetery in the Hollywood Hills, which the temple acquired in 1967 from the neighboring Forest Lawn Memorial Park. In 1997 Mount Sinai dedicated a second cemetery location in Simi Valley. Notable people and events Rabbi Zvi Dershowitz delivers a speech at a baby-naming ceremony (Jewish life-cycle event) at Sinai Temple in Los Angeles on October 13, 2014. David Wolpe, Sinai Temple's current senior rabbi, is an author and leader of the Conservative movement. In 2008, a Newsweek article named him the most influential pulpit rabbi in the United States. Other notable clergy of Sinai Temple have included Rabbi David Lieber, who later headed the University of Judaism; cantor and composer Meir Finkelstein; Rabbi Sherre Hirsch, and Emeritus Rabbi Zvi Dershowitz.Tom Tugend, \\"Wolpe Reaches Sinai\\", The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, July 24, 1997.Julie G. Fax, \\"Class Notes: Camp Ramah celebrates Golden Anniversary\\", The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, November 30, 2006. Rabbi Laurence Scheindlin, former headmaster of Sinai Akiba Academy, came to the school in 1977, when it had 170 students. As of 2010 the school had 560 students. He has published a number of articles on emotions and spiritual education. In 2009 Rabbi Scheindlin became the first school head to be elected president of the Solomon Schechter Day School Association, the national association of day schools that identify with Conservative Judaism. \\"Friday Night Live\\", a lively, music-driven Shabbat service intended to attract younger congregants, was initially developed by Rabbi Wolpe and musician Craig Taubman at Sinai Temple; the concept is now replicated in other synagogues around the world. In June 2006, a Friday Night Live service at Sinai Temple saw an appearance by evangelical Christian minister and author Rick Warren, Warren's first appearance as featured speaker in a synagogue. Sinai Temple has been notably impacted by the wave of Persian Jews who immigrated to the United States after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. Prior to this event, the congregation had been overwhelmingly composed of Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European heritage. As many Persian Jews emigrated to Los Angeles, a substantial number joined Sinai Temple; over time the Persian Jews became more fully integrated into the congregation, which is now made up of about even proportions of Ashkenazim and Persians. Jimmy Delshad became the first Persian Jew to become president of Sinai Temple in 1990; in 2007 he was elected as mayor of Beverly Hills. In 1999, Sinai Temple was the site of a \\"second bar mitzvah\\" for actor Kirk Douglas, then age 83. Also in 1999, the 14th Dalai Lama spoke to an overflow audience as part of the World Festival of Sacred Music.

During Hollands' time with the club, Millwall reached the third qualifying round in 1892 where they were defeated 3–4 by local rivals, Woolwich Arsenal. The following year, (now known as Millwall Athletic) they again reached the third qualifying round against Woolwich Arsenal, with the \\"Gunners\\" running out 2–0 winners. In the 1894 close-season, Hollands moved to Hampshire to join Southampton St Mary's. In 1894, Southampton St Mary's, together with Millwall Athletic, were one of the nine founder members of the Southern League, which had been created to enable clubs in southern England who were not admitted to the Football League, to play competitive football on a regular basis. For the start of their League career, Saints signed several new players on professional contracts, including Charles Baker, Lachie Thomson and Alf Littlehales from Stoke and Hollands from Millwall.

Described as \\"a small, fair- haired left-winger\\", Hollands was a \\"smart, nimble dribbler\\". Hollands retained his place at outside-left, playing in every League and FA Cup match, except the final match of the season. Southampton finished the league season in third place, eight points behind the champions, Hollands' former club, Millwall Athletic. In the FA Cup, Southampton met Newbury in the first qualifying round on 13 October 1894. The Saints were \\"in particularly rampant mood\\" and won 14–0, with Hollands scoring twice; this is still Southampton's biggest victory in a competitive match. The Saints went on to reach the First Round proper for the first time, going out 1–4 to Football League First Division opponents Nottingham Forest. In July 1895, Hollands returned to London to re-join Millwall Athletic, helping them to retain their Southern League title in 1895–96 before being re-instated as an amateur in 1896.

Directed by George Archainbaud from a screenplay by Wallace Smith, it is the second film adaptation of the 1909 novel of the same name by Rex Beach, which is a follow up to his earlier novel, The Spoilers. The first filming of The Silver Horde was a silent 1920 film also titled The Silver Horde. The title is a reference to the salmon fishing industry in Alaska, and the color of the fish bulging in the fishermen's nets. Plot \\"Alaska——and two weary men struggle to the end of a long, long trail.\\" In the Alaska wilderness, Boyd Emerson and Fraser, arrive by dogsled at a village. They are puzzled to receive a chilly welcome from its inhabitants. Frustrated, Boyd gets into a fight with local George Balt, which is broken up by Cherry Malotte. She invites the newcomers to dinner. She explains that they have stumbled into a bitter struggle between two rival fishing groups, hers and Fred Marsh's. Boyd is ready to give up his fruitless search for gold. Cherry reinvigorates him and persuades him to join her side. She sends him, Fraser and Balt to Seattle to get a loan of $200,000 from Cherry's banker friend, Tom Hilliard, to rebuild a cannery. After concluding the deal, Boyd goes to see his socialite fiancée, Mildred Wayland. She is determined to marry him, despite her father's wish that she wed someone with wealth: none other than Fred Marsh. When Marsh provokes him, Boyd carelessly blurts out his plans. Wayne Wayland and Marsh conspire and succeed in having Cherry's financing withdrawn. Notified, Cherry sails for Seattle and dines with Hilliard. It soon becomes plain to the banker that Cherry has fallen in love with Boyd. He explains that the young man already has a girlfriend, and points out the couple dancing elsewhere in the establishment. Cherry then secures the loan by taking up Hilliard's offer to go to his apartment. Boyd assumes, however, that it was due to Mildred's influence with her father. Returning to Alaska with new machinery and Balt's crew, Boyd gets the cannery running in weeks, just in time for the annual salmon run. When Marsh sends his men to wreck their equipment, a brawl breaks out on the water, during which the Waylands arrive on their yacht. Marsh tells Mildred about Cherry, that she is a notorious prostitute known from Sitka to San Francisco. He lies, telling Mildred that Cherry got the loan by spending the night with Hilliard at Boyd's insistence, and that she is more than Boyd's business partner. Mildred ends her engagement, despite Boyd's protests of innocence. Boyd, meanwhile, breaks up with Cherry when she cannot deny how she got the money. Concerned only about Boyd's happiness, Cherry contacts an old friend in her former trade, Queenie. The two board the Wayland yacht, where Cherry proves that Queenie is Marsh's wife. Cherry then convinces Mildred that, while she loves Boyd, nothing happened between them. When Boyd shows up, Mildred is eager to take him back, but by this time, he realizes who he truly loves. He finds Cherry and tells her he cares only about their future together, not her past.

The publishing company followed a short-lived journal that he founded, of the same name. The company is currently managed from a tiny home-office in Chennai by Narayan's granddaughter Bhuvaneswari (Minnie). Although the company was started as an effort in self-publishing, it is far from being a vanity press. The war and other factors meant that his British publishers did not stock their Indian warehouses and Indian readers had no access to his books resulting in Narayan starting the company. Most of the work was done by Narayan himself including distribution and collecting delinquent bills. During one such task, he met with the proprietor of India Book House who convinced him to hand over the distribution function to them. India Book House continues to be the company's sole distributor. In 2006, on Narayan's birth centenary, Indian Thought Publications issued a commemorative coffee table edition of his 1974 autobiography, My Days, with an introduction by his long-time admirer Alexander McCall Smith.

The Sethupathis are a Tamil clan of the Maravar community native to the Ramanathapuram and Sivaganga district of Tamil Nadu, India. They were from the 17th century considered independent kings who ruled the Ramnad kingdo, also known as Maravar country. The male rulers of Ramnathapuram also bore the title of \\"Sethupathi\\" or \\"protector of the bridge\\", which was first granted to the first Sethupathi Raghunatha Kilavan by the Thanjavur Nayaks, the bridge here referring to the legendary sacred Rama's Bridge (Adam's Bridge), while female rulers bore the title \\"Nachiyar\\". Among the seventy two poligars (feudal title of chieftains under Nayaka rulers) of the region, the Sethupathi stood first. This special position was conferred not based upon the revenue that his kingdom generated but because of his military prowess. Back in the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Sethupathi ruler could mobilize a considerable army, about 30,000 to 40,000 strong at short notice(one week). Under the Madurai Nayak king Muthukrishnappa Nayak, the first recorded Sethupathi, Saidaika kuravar who assumed the title Udaiyan Rakunatha Sethupathi was installed as ruler from 1606–1621. The Sethupathis who were under the suzerainty of the Madurai Nayak, gained its full independence in 1702. The Ramnad Kingdom lost its independence under British Empire and became a Zamindari divided into the Ramnad estate also called Greater Marava and Sivaganga estate also called Little Marava.  Etymology  The title Sethupathi is a Tamil term meaning \\"Lord of Sethu\\", where Sethu refers to Adam's Bridge, a chain of limestone shoals from Rameswaram Island in India to Mannar Island in Sri Lanka. The Maravar clan from 5th century CE were patrons of the Ramanathaswamy Temple, which is also known as Sethu and thereupon assumed the title Sethupathi. The title \\"Sethu Kavalar\\" meaning \\"Guardian of Sethu\\" was a title used by the Aryacakravarti dynasty of Jaffna Kingdom, who also used the term \\"Sethu\\" on their coin on account of being related to the Sethupathis.  Sethupathis of Ramnad and Sivaganga  The rulers of Ramnad and Sivaganga region of early l7th Century were called Sethupathis. The Nayak ruler Muthukrishnappa Nayak reestablished the ancient line of sethupathys who were the chieftains under the pandyas in the beginning of 17th century as protector and guardian of the pilgrims to Sethusamudram and Rameswaram. The protector of Sethusamudram was called as Sethupathy. Sadaikkathevar was a loyal subordinate of the Nayaks. He emerged as the chief of the poligas. Sethupathis were maravas of Ramnad, Madurai and Tirunelveli. They had Ramnad as their official headquarters.

It was originally built as a luxury long-term residential apartment house for movie stars by Elinor K. Ince, widow of Thomas H. Ince, the highly successful pioneer silent filmmaker who died in 1924. Designed by eminent architect Arthur E. Harvey as a prominent seven-story replica of a 17th-century French-Normandy castle, it remains as the most impressive of several Hollywood chateaux built during the area's booming 1920s.

Meza Murillo wrote in various modern styles and his works were regularly published throughout his productive life, but he came to national and then international attention as one of the pioneers of serious poetry written in the local rural dialects of Central America. He was a descendant of a storied Spanish noble family which included the line of powerful Marquises of San Miguel de Aguayo who played a major role in the development and expansion of the Spanish Empire into North America against French interests and the settlement of what would become Texas. Meza Murillo's great grandfather was the last official sent by the Spanish Crown to what would become Central America. His ancestor played a leading role in Central America's bloodless break from Spain and the events that followed for which he was stripped of his titles by the King of Spain and came to settle in what would become Costa Rica. Meza Murillo grew up on his family's large estates where he came into contact with the rural dialects and communities. While sent to study abroad and accomplished in many fields, including politics where he served as the Mayor of one of Costa Rica's major cities, he continuously published poetry in newspapers and journals under the pen name Domitilo Abarca until his death. He gained a large following and helped to develop a Central American voice in poetry in the beginning of the twentieth century as well as bringing attention to the rural communities who he gave voice to in his work. Upon his youthful death there were major articles in newspapers throughout Central America identifying him as Domitilo Abarca and lamenting his too early passing. Meza Murillo was, however, prolific, and his large body of work remained very much alive. His poetry has been collected and published by EUNED (Editorial Universidad Estatal A Distancia) under the editorship of Alfredo Cruz Bolanos and Luis Ferrero, which recently published a new complete collection of his known works including several newly rediscovered poems which were preserved by his surviving daughter Gladys Meza de Dominguez who emigrated to New York following the death of her only sibling, her older brother also named Andres Meza, during the political unrest in the 1950s.

He was born at Zillmere, Queensland. Career Carrigan, a middle order batsman and part-time medium pace bowler, made his first-class debut in the 1945/46 season but had to wait until the following summer to make his first Sheffield Shield appearance as the competition had been in recess due to the war. It wasn't until his 20th first-class match that he made a century, an innings of 166 against South Australia in Brisbane, although he had previously amassed a pair of 90s. His bowling was used to good effect on occasions and he claimed 14 wickets at 30.92 in 1948/49. During his career he dismissed batsman to the calibre of Neil Harvey and Arthur Morris. Captaincy After filling in for two matches in 1950/51, Carrigan was Queensland's captain for the entire 1951/52 Sheffield Shield season, where they finished equal second on the points table. He also had the distinction of captaining his state to a first- class win over the touring West Indians, who had won their last two Test series in India and England. They played a four-day match, as a warm-up for the 1st Test at the Brisbane Cricket Ground later in the week. A six-wicket haul to Colin McCool restricted the tourists to just 198 in their first innings and Queensland, in reply, would amass 455 runs. Carrigan had come to the crease at 2–184 and went on to score 169 of the remaining 271 runs, before being bowled by Gerry Gomez, with a new highest first-class score. The West Indies again struggled in the second innings, with another six-wicket performance, this time to Mick Raymer, leaving the Queenslanders requiring just 29 runs to win, which they achieved without losing a wicket. It was his last summer with Queensland and he spent the 1952 off-season in England playing for the Church and Oswaldtwistle Cricket Club in the Lancashire League. Australian football Carrigan was also a noted Australian rules footballer in Queensland Australian National Football League. He played as a wingman for Windsor and joined Leo O'Connor as the only Queensland cricket captains to represent the state at Australian football.

Background Following the death and state funeral of President Zia-ul-Haq, Benazir Bhutto was elected as the Prime Minister of Pakistan after successfully campaigning in the nationwide general elections held in 1988. As early as 1989, the army staff under General Aslam Beg, then–Chief of Army Staff, had been at odds on the policy matters relating the handling of the security situation in Afghanistan, immediately after Prime Minister Bhutto removed Hamid Gul from the intelligence agency over his failure to sustained Pakistan's national interests in the country. According to the ISI's insider information, it was President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg who wanted the administrative changes in the civilian government to control the government in their favor. In September 1989, the Internal Wing of the ISI, allegedly working under the directions from Gen. Aslam Beg, attempted to mount an effort to bring the vote of no-confidence movement in the Parliament in order to remove Benazir Bhutto, which would force new nationwide elections in 1990. This covert military intelligence program actively ran under Brig. Imtiaz Ahmad, then-Add.-Dir. of the Internal Wing, who oversaw with Amir Khan (the FIA agent on counterintelligence). Counterintelligence and exposure Despite its covert nature and secrecy, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) under its director Masood Khan was able to track the program based on the benefitted secret information on the activities of the Internal Wing on political matters. Eventually, the Intelligence Bureau was able to tapped the telephones and further videotaping the conversation of Brig. Imtiaz Ahmad and Amir Khan trying to financially influence and convince the two senior parliamentarians belonging on the platform of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). When the scandal exposed in the civil society by the IB through the news media, the major allegations were directed toward Gen. Aslam Beg, then-army chief, and also implicating President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and S. R. Kallu, then-Director ISI. Efforts to authorize the court martial of the Gen. Beg failed due to lack of evidence as Gen. Beg denied his involvement but authorized the Pakistan Army's JAG Corps to establish the court martial hearings of Brig. Imtiaz, who was dismissed from his one-star general rank in the Army. Military investigations and prosecution leveled charges and held Amir Khan of responsible of this scandal, who later testified in his court hearings that the primary objective were to support Nawaz Sharif as the establishment was said to have \\"liked\\" or preferred Sharif as a country's prime minister, and was a part of his political camp. As Amir Khan told his military lawyers that: \\"Nawaz Sharif was more acceptable to the [Pakistan] Army than Benazir Bhutto, and the establishment was against of every leader who had people's mandate behind them. They prefer weak leaders like Sharif, which the Army could control\\". Despite the fact the scandal was exposed, the conspiracies against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto continued until another political scandal was reported in 1990.

He was fluent in Persian and Arabic.Tarikhe Torbat-e-Heydariyeh ba tekiyeh bar naghshe Eshaq Khan Qaraei, by Mohammad Qanei Rise to power Eshaq overcame extraordinary odds to establish himself as a leader of the Qaraei. The son of a Persian servant by the name of Mohammad Khoo to the supreme chief Najaf Qoli Khan Qara Tatar, the chief of the Qaraei tribe. Eshaq inherited a social position that was inferior to even the lowest member of a military tribe. His father gained the attention of the leader of the Qaraei tribe and was appointed yuzbashi or centurion. Consequently, Eshaq was granted the position of Yessawul (mace bearer) to the chief and used this position to convince the chief of a need for a caravansarai in the then small village of Zaveh. While undertaking this project the ambitions of Eshaq began to manifest themselves. As Eshaq's project grew, he slowly converted the caravansarai into a fort while simultaneously fomenting quarrels and divisions within the tribe through various intrigues. His plan culminated in Najaf Qoli's being murdered by his own officers with the chief's sons fleeing Khorasan. Soon afterward, he married the daughter of Najaf Qoli and entered into an alliance with Ahmad Shah Durrani. These maneuvers gained him the leadership of the tribe. As the chief of the tribe, he managed to transform Zaveh into a prosperous and safe district, while also making a fortune through farming, leasing camels to merchants, and developing an export/import trade. Eshaq Khan’s allegiance to Tehran (and also to Herat) remained nominal, and his display of submission to Agha Mohammad Khan and Fath Ali Shah at the time of their marches on Mashhad in 1796 and 1802, respectively, was anything but genuine. Fath Ali Shah’s appointment in 1803 of his young son, Mohammad Vali Mirza Qajar, as governor of Khorasan was probably perceived by Eshaq Khan as a move designed to exact his allegiance and thus did not please the ambitious chief). However, he used this opportunity and joined his service and assumed the positions of Sardar (commander of the armies) and Vazir (prime minister). Downfall The influence of Eshaq completely overshadowed that of Mohammad Vali, a state of affairs that aroused Eshaq's ambitions. He initiated a conspiracy with the chiefs of Khabushan, Radkan, Chenaran, Qayen, and Tabas to unseat the governor and assume the reins himself. The plan was successful and Mohammad Vali was placed under house arrest. After plundering Mashhad, Eshaq's co-conspirators began quarreling over the spoils and challenging Eshaq's right to accession. Eshaq assembled those still loyal to him and restored Mohammad Vali to office. In an attempt to make amends he gave the governor one of his daughters in marriage. The result of this marriage was a boy Jafar Qoli Mirza Qajar. Eshaq undertook a visit to the court in Tehran where he convinced the Shah that Mohammad Vali was incompetent. Fath Ali accordingly issued a farman (royal order) declaring Eshaq as the Hakim of Mashhad, thus relegating the shahzadeh to the position of ornament. In his turn, Mohammad Vali sneaked off to Tehran. There, he represented Eshaq to be an ambitious and dangerous man whose progress needed to be checked. The Shah became convinced and ordered Mohammad Vali to execute Eshaq. Finally on 8 July 1816 he and his eldest son, Hasan Ali Khan Qaraei-Torbati, were strangled by the order and in the presence of Mohammad Vali Mirza Qajar. The executions, however, only exacerbated the situation, forcing Fath Ali Shah (who also feared an Afghan attack) to remove his son from the post of governor of Khorasan and replace him with his other brother Hasan Ali Mirza Qajar.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eshaq- qarai References Category:Iranian military commanders Category:1743 births Category:1816 deaths ","title":"Eshaq Khan Qaraei-Torbati"},{"id":"24162615","text":"Celestine Joseph Damiano (November 1, 1911 – October 2, 1967) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church.

He received his episcopal consecration on February 11, 1953 from Bishop Joseph A. Burke, with Archbishop John Francis O'Hara, C.S.C., and Bishop Leo Richard Smith serving as co-consecrators, at St. Joseph's Cathedral.

McCarthy in December 1959, Damiano was named the third Bishop of Camden, New Jersey (with the personal title of Archbishop) on January 24, 1960. He was installed at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on May 3, 1960.

Most flowers consist of a single whorl of sepals termed a calyx; a single whorl of petals termed a corolla; one or more whorls of stamens (together termed the androecium); and a single whorl of carpels termed the gynoecium. This is a cyclic arrangement. Some flowers contain flower parts with a spiral arrangement. Such flowers are not cyclic. However in the common case of spirally arranged sepals on an otherwise cyclic flower, the term hemicyclic may be used. The suffix -cyclic is used to denote the number of whorls contained within a flower. The most common case is the pentacyclic flower, which contains five whorls: a calyx, a corolla, two whorls of stamens, and a single whorl of carpels. Another common case is the tetracyclic flower, which contains only one whorl of stamens, and therefore only four whorls in total. Tricyclic flowers also occur, generally where there is a single undifferentiated perianth. Flowers with more than five whorls are also not uncommon. The greatest variation occurs in the calyx and the androecium. Calyces of up to nine whorls have been recorded, and up to 12 whorls of stamens have been observed.

He then went on hiatus until August, when he scored twice. He had two confirmed victories and one unconfirmed in both September and October. His final victory, on 10 November, the day before the armistice, was his 21st and the jasta's 91st and final one. He and his Staffelfuehrer, Heinrich Kroll, had accounted for half the wins scored by their squadron. He was awarded the enlisted man's equivalent to the Blue Max, the Military Merit Cross, on 11 April 1918. He was also awarded the Silver Wound Badge, as he had been wounded three times.

Overview Designed by English Argentine architect Juan Waldorp, Patio Bullrich was originally built as an auction house in 1867 for the prominent local Bullrich family. The auction house was long one of the city's premier sales floors for livestock, particularly prize bulls, and thoroughbreds, as well as serving as a consignment house for a variety of valuable heirlooms and other collectible items. The upscale area's rising real estate values prompted the Bullrich family to sell the acre-size Avenida del Libertador lot to Alto Palermo, S.A., a leading local commercial real estate developer during the mid-1980s. Alto Palermo commissioned Pfeifer & Zurdo Architects to convert the cavernous building into a shopping center. Designing a six-story arcade they maintained some of the original aspects of Waldorp's design, including a massive clock tower numerous marble animal head wall sculptures and the neoclassical façade. Inaugurated in August 1988, Patio Bullrich was the first of a series of new upscale shopping galleries opened in subsequent years to replace aging favorites, and pre-dated Galerías Pacífico, the better-known shopping center likewise built in a historic building, by three years. Modernized and expanded in 1995, Patio Bullrich used to house numerous international luxury brands, including Carolina Herrera, Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix and Tiffany & Co.. There was also a stagecraft gift shop run by the Colón Theatre Foundation and four cinemas. However, many luxury brands have been forced to abandon the Argentine market due to government's import restrictions. Several luxury brands have expressed interest of returning to Argentina after President Mauricio Macri's government intended to relax import restrictions.

Hasan Ali ventured to Zaveh to attempt to placate Mohammad Khan for the treacherous murder of his father.

This latter practice gained him covert alliances with the Khan of Khiva and the Emir of Bukhara, a situation that did little to enhance his reputation in Tehran. In 1832 the crown prince, Abbas Mirza, after subduing the Salor of Sarakhs, turned his attention to Mohammad Khan and his renegade tribe. Under the guise of using Zaveh as a staging ground for his army's invasion of Herat, Abbas moved the royal forces into the Qaraei district where he deceived Mohammad into a meeting that resulted in his capture. The independence of the Qaraei tribe and the district of Zaveh ended with Mohammad Khan. The governors of the district were thereafter no longer of the Qaraei tribe but of the Qajar tribe.

The chain was founded as a single store on July 1, 1963, by Harry Eberlin, a United States Air Force Veteran and freelance auto-parts dealer. Initially named San Bernardino Racing Equipment, the first store was located at 25824 East Baseline Road in San Bernardino, California. After the opening of several stores, the corporation changed names in 1977 from San Bernardino Racing Equipment Inc. to Super Shops, Inc. The chain rebranded its stores as Super Shops Automotive Performance Centers in 1978. The Super Shops chain sponsored racing events and National Hot Rod Association drag racing teams. The corporation went out of business in 1998 due to a series of bad business decisions (primarily from a newly appointed CEO) and financial debt. The Super Shops trademarks and corporate name were later registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office by an unrelated El Cajon based firm in 2003 and cancelled in 2012. Since 2013, the Super Shops trademarks and corporate name were obtained by a nostalgia group of former workers and customers to provide the sale of T-shirts and other memorabilia.  History   1960s  Super Shops was originally a single location Speed Shop, operating under the name \\"San Bernardino Racing Equipment\\" at 25824 East Baseline Road in San Bernardino, California. It was founded, owned and operated by Harry Eberlin. Prior to this first location opening, Eberlin would go to street racing locations, hangouts, drag strips and swap meets where he would sell speed parts out of the trunk of his car. Eberlin spent many long hours at the shop, and personally negotiated equipment purchases with other notable legends of the industry. He quickly won the loyalty of local racers who had previously been traveling long distances to find the parts they needed.  1970s  The first expansion of Eberlin's operations took place when he opened his second location at 3893 Seventh Street, in Riverside, California. This second location opened on June 4, 1972. Driven by the success of the first and second locations, Harry continued to expand, opening a third location at 1249 West Holt Boulevard in Ontario, California, on March 30, 1973. The year 1974 saw the addition of his fourth location at 4550 University Avenue in San Diego, California, on March 22, 1974. A fifth location was added in Garden Grove in 1975, with additional locations at Long Beach in 1976, Covina and Van Nuys in 1977, and Sacramento in 1978. The year 1978 saw the first store opening outside the state of California—at 2990 South State Street in Salt Lake City, Utah. This store opened on June 19, 1978. One additional California location was opened at 415 West Valley Boulevard in San Gabriel on June 1, 1978. A second out-of-state location came online at 16 West Camelback in Phoenix, Arizona, on November 23, 1978. Tucson, Arizona; Lakewood, Colorado; and San Jose, California; came online in 1979, bringing the number of stores in operation to 15. During the 1970s, there was one store that ended up relocating because a landlord refused to renew a lease with reasonable terms. Other than that, Eberlin was proud to point out that no store had ever been closed in the history of the chain (up to the moment of bankruptcy in 1998).  1980s  With Eberlin now operating a 15-store chain of speed shops, he turned his attention to his long-running dream of operating a nationwide chain of automotive performance centers, appealing to the masses. Starting in 1980, aggressive expansion took place. Eberlin had long owned the name \\"Super Shops\\"—he registered it on January 10, 1972. Super Shops Automotive Performance Centers was the official name now, and from 1980 until the end of 1989, 128 stores were opened, bringing the total store count to 143. A new store was opening on an average of just over once per month, and a simultaneous marketing, hiring, training and selling juggernaut had been created on the fly. The latter half of the 1980s saw Super Shops sponsoring numerous race teams in various classes of competition, operating race support trailers sponsored by Mallory and Erson, and becoming highly involved with Top Fuel through sponsorship of Big Daddy Don Garlits, and later, Eddie and Ercie Hill.  1990s  By the year 1992, Super Shops was operating 165 retail locations, three distribution centers (San Bernardino, Grand Prairie, Texas, and Jacksonville, Florida), two corporate head offices (Victoria Court and Tippecanoe, in San Bernardino), two speed parts manufacturers (Mallory and Erson) and a mail order Operation (ASAP). In addition to these operations, the corporation owned and operated two corporate jets (a Cessna Citation 1 and a Dassault Falcon 50), and Eberlin had a portfolio of real estate holdings named \\"HRE Development Corporation\\" consisting of many store locations and other key properties. The late 1990s saw a proliferation of vehicles becoming \\"black box automobile systems\\" (vehicles no longer easily modified by their owners due to computers and emissions systems being interdependent), along with an apparent decline of car owners as car hobbyists per-capita. As a result, few aftermarket parts manufacturers were quick to respond with the types of innovative products we now see today—and this \\"moment of hesitation\\" had a dramatic negative impact on the nationwide network of performance parts suppliers, including Super Shops. Many Speed Shops faded away or closed abruptly during this time. This was not the single cause, but was one of the major causes that led to the eventual bankruptcy and liquidation of Super Shops in 1998. In 2016, a former customer asked Ed Steele, a former area manager, the reason for the closing of Super Shops. Steele responded with his personal opinion based on his direct discussions with Harry and his personal experiences.transcript  Aftermath  Super Shops remains a topic both dearly admired and hotly contested among a population of former customers and employees. At the height of operations, Super Shops employed more than 1300 employees. Over the history of the company from 1963 to 1998, there were over 15,000 employees on record as hired, resigned or terminated. There are a number of other online resources available for those parties interested in the topic, including social media pages, vendors of nostalgic apparel, and other artifacts and items of interest from the era when stores were in operation.  Commercials  Super Shops advertised heavily on the radio. An announcer, Doug Collins, would forcefully tell about the latest parts deals of the week, with hard rock music in the background. Super Shops radio ads used a stock \\"rock\\" music generic background with drag racing sound effects in the background. The music borrowed heavily from Santana's \\"All I Ever Wanted\\". Later, Harry commissioned a \\"custom\\" original music track for the background and retained the drag racing sounds.

It stars Drew Barrymore and Justin Long as a young couple, Erin and Garrett, who fall in love one summer in New York City and try to keep their long-distance relationship alive, when Erin heads home to San Francisco. Plot Erin Langford (Drew Barrymore) is 31 and still in grad school, recently hired as a summer intern at a New York newspaper. Out with a friend at a bar, she meets Garrett (Justin Long), who interrupts her game of Centipede. They drink together and end up at his place, where they smoke from a bong and have sex while Garrett's roommate Dan (Charlie Day) \\"DJs their hook up\\". The next morning, Erin is anxious to leave, but agrees to have breakfast with Garrett. She tells him she is only in New York for six weeks, and they agree to keep things casual. Erin and Garrett begin a casual relationship, but soon develop feelings for each other, and Erin tries to convince her boss to find her a permanent position. Before the end of her internship, she writes a well-received article, and her boss asks her to contact him in January regarding possible job openings. Working at a record label, Garett is assigned to manage a band he dislikes, and begins to terribly resent his job. When Erin’s six weeks are over, she and Garett find it difficult to let each other go. After driving Erin to the airport and saying goodbye, Garrett runs after her, admitting that he is crazy about her and wants to have a long-distance relationship, to which she agrees. Over the following months, Erin and Garrett spend their free time trying to figure out when they can see each other. Garrett surprises Erin by showing up on Thanksgiving. After an emotional reunion, they go to Erin's sister Corrine's house, where Erin is staying, and start to have passionate sex on the dining table. Unbeknownst to them, Erin's brother-in-law Phil is having dinner, and Corrine walks in on the awkward scene. The next day, Erin and Garrett see The Boxer Rebellion perform, but Garrett is jealous that Erin is friends with Damon, a handsome bartender, and eventually has to return to New York. In January, Erin calls her former boss, but learns they are not hiring. Unable to find comfort in a phone conversation with Garrett, Erin gets drunk with Damon and almost kisses him, but goes home. Her professor recommends her for a position at the San Francisco Chronicle and she goes for an interview. Garrett tries to have phone sex with Erin, but it ended up being awkward, leaving both feeling ridiculous. A month later, Erin is packing to move to New York when she gets a call that the Chronicle has hired her. She goes to New York and tells Garrett, and they fight, but make up the next day. A week later, he calls to tell her he wants her to move to New York so they can live together and start fresh, and she agrees, first visiting San Francisco to sort things out. After a conversation with Corrine, Garrett realizes he should not be the reason Erin turns down the job, and they part ways after an emotional conversation and a long hug at the airport. Six months later, Erin’s career is going well, having written her first front-page story. Garrett has not been with any woman since Erin, and quits his job to manage The Boxer Rebellion. He sends Erin tickets to their show and she goes, unaware he is the band’s manager. She runs into him, and he reveals he has moved to Los Angeles, only a few hours from San Francisco, and they seize another chance at a relationship. Late that night they go back to Corrine's house, and interrupt Corrine and Phil dry humping on the dining room table. The film ends as Erin's niece, Maya, enters during the awkward moment, and they all scream \\"Maya! Statue!\\" – a running joke where Corrine yells at her daughter to freeze.

This meant its opening weekend would coincide with the Labor Day weekend. Dan Fellman, Warner Bros. Domestic Distribution President, stated that \\"moving to the Labor Day weekend not only allows us to take advantage of the long holiday weekend, but gives us some distance from the other female-driven films releasing in August.\\" Eventually, Going the Distance′s earliest release was on September 2, 2010, in eight countries including Australia, Argentina and Germany, one day before its North American release. Box office Going the Distance opened in 3,030 theaters in the United States and Canada on September 3, 2010, and grossed $6,884,964 in its opening weekend, ranking 5th at the box office behind The American, Machete, Takers and The Last Exorcism. The film eventually grossed $17,804,299 in North America, ranking 120th domestically for 2010. In foreign markets the film grossed $24,248,458, for a total worldwide box office of $42,052,757, which made it the 118th highest-grossing film of 2010. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 54% based on 166 reviews, with an average rating of 5.75/10. The site's critical consensus states: \\"It's timelier and a little more honest than most romantic comedies, but Drew Barrymore and Justin Long's screen chemistry doesn't make up for Going the Distances overall flatness and convoluted story.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. USA Today′s Claudia Puig panned the writing, stating that \\"this premise, with better writing, could have made a much more compelling movie\\", and Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wondered \\"exactly at what audience the filmmakers thought they were aiming\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times said the film \\"acknowledges both the difficulty and the comic potential of the arrangement, and does so with enough insight and charm to make you wonder why frequent-flier love is not a more popular theme in romantic comedies\\", while Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post described it as \\"filthy, funny and kind of sweet\\". Tom Long of The Detroit News stated that the film's \\"constant raunch factor balances out its romantic center in a way that will likely surprise and please many\\", and Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle that it \\"captures the harshness and the sweetness of our time\\". Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer said \\"the film gets many things so right about the conflicts faced by a two- career couple looking for work in a shrinking economy\\", and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly that the film is \\"the rare romantic comedy in which you can actually believe what you're seeing\\". Linda Barnard, film critic for Toronto Star, said that the film \\"is a reminder of the sorry state of the rom- com, where gross scenes and easy-to-write trash talk have replaced smart dialogue\\". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune stated that \\"Geoff LaTulippe's story of a recession-era long-distance relationship and its hurdles takes its characters seriously\\", also praising Barrymore's performance, for whom The Boston Globe's film critic Wesley Morris said that \\"is becoming a serious comedic actor\\". Justin Chang of Variety describes the film as \\"a bicoastal comedy with a bit of a bipolar disorder\\", while Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter panned the film and screenwriting implying that it is a \\"romantic comedy [which is] going wrong in so many different ways\\". Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, concluded that \\"Barrymore and Long are both appealing, but not enough to sustain audience interest in the cinematic equivalent of dry-humping\\".

The film is directed by Burr Steers and stars Zac Efron and Amanda Crew. The story is of Charlie St. Cloud's choice between keeping a promise he made to his brother, who died in a car accident, or going after the girl he loves. In some markets the film used the complete title of the book. The film was released on July 30, 2010. It received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $48 million. Plot Charlie St. Cloud is a sailor who wins a boating race on his sailboat, the Splendid Splinter, along with his younger brother Sam. In 2005, he receives a sailing scholarship to Stanford University. Charlie graduates from Winslow High School and after returning from his graduation ceremony, Charlie promises Sam that they will practice baseball every day until he leaves for Stanford. That night Charlie is supposed to go to a graduation party with his friends, but his mother makes him babysit Sam while she picks up another shift at her job. When Sam watches television, Charlie tries sneaking out to the party. He is caught by Sam, who asks Charlie to drive him to his friend Tommy's house. Charlie and Sam get into a car accident. During an out-of-body experience, Charlie hugs a badly wounded Sam and reassures him that everything will be fine. Knowing his injuries are fatal, Sam asks Charlie to never leave him alone, saying that if so they will always be together. As Charlie promises, a paramedic named Florio Ferrente revives Charlie; Sam has died in his arms. At Sam's funeral, Charlie runs off after being unable to put Sam's baseball glove in the grave. After a run through the woods, Charlie finds Sam's spirit and discovers that Sam can interact with him on the physical plane. Charlie fulfills Sam's dying wish by practicing baseball with him every day at sunset. Five years later, Charlie, who gave up his scholarship, is a caretaker at Waterside Cemetery. At the cemetery, he speaks with Sully, an old friend who died in the Marines. During a trip into town, Charlie visits the boat docks and meets Tess Carroll, a sailor planning to sail solo around the world. The following day, Charlie runs into Florio. Florio is dying of cancer and asks Charlie if he ever wonders why he was saved. Charlie returns to the cemetery and finds Tess injured tending her father's grave. He takes her to his home to patch her up and they develop a relationship. Sam begins feeling that he is being erased from existence because Charlie is forgetting him when Charlie arrives late for their game. Tess follows Charlie and he explains to her that the more he is in her world, the less he is in Sam's. Charlie discovers that Tess went missing while sailing through a storm a few days earlier; Charlie has been seeing her just like he can Sam. Florio's wife Carla tells Charlie that Florio died the previous night. During one of the evenings Charlie and Tess have together they play hide and seek. Tess sticks a note on the door which says \\"come find me\\" with a drawing of a boat beneath it. Charlie realizes that Tess is not dead and that he must find her. Along with his friend Alistair and Tess's coach Tink, Charlie takes a boat to find her. The following sunset, Charlie misses his game with Sam. As Charlie confesses his love for his departed sibling, Sam tells Charlie that he loves him back and moves on from the living world. He appears to Charlie as a shooting star in the sky to reveal Tess' location. The group finds Tess' wrecked boat along with her lying on the rocks. Charlie uses his body heat to keep Tess warm until they are found by the Coast Guard. Alistair tells Charlie that Tess had hypothermia and he saved her. Later, Charlie purchases an old dilapidated sail boat from a family-friend and asks Tess if she would like to take a ride with him. However, Tess fears him explaining that she had vivid dreams about them together. Charlie tells Tess that her dreams are memories and recites a quote from her father's funeral that they spoke about in her dreams. Charlie resigns from his job and goes into the forest to say farewell to Sam, telling him they will always be brothers; although he is unable to see him, Sam is there and reveals that he is at peace. Sometime in the near future, Charlie and Tess complete repairs to the sail boat and set off to sail around the world.

Three studios competed for the rights. Universal Studios and Marc Platt (Universal's president of production) won the right to make the book into a film, paying a reported $500,000 to $1 million for the rights (with that figure rising above $1 million if the film is made). Ben Sherwood was guaranteed an executive producer credit on the film, and Universal Studios executive producer Donna Langley was assigned to the picture. Joe Johnston was initially chosen to direct. Drafts for the script were written by James Schamus and Lewis Colick, but the final script was written by Craig Pearce. By March 2009, Johnston had been replaced as director by Burr Steers, and Platt had named himself as producer. Steers helped polish the script. The first lead performer cast in the film was Zac Efron, who turned down the lead role in Paramount Pictures' remake of Footloose to star in this film. Pre-production had commenced by March 2009, with filming set to begin in July 2009. Training with Efron began in Vancouver, British Columbia, in July 2009, and started production in Upstate New York July 2009 to October 5. Amanda Crew joined the film as Tess Carroll in July 2009, and was shooting her scenes the following September. Quite a few scenes in the film were shot in Gibsons, British Columbia, including a scene in the famous 'Beachcombers' restaurant. Some of the film was also filmed at a Deep Cove school, Seycove Secondary School, in North Vancouver, B. C. Actress Kim Basinger agreed to play Louise St. Cloud (later Claire) in mid-August 2009. Teen actor Chris Massoglia was signed in October 2009 to play a teenaged Sam St. Cloud, but never made it into the final film.As of October 25, 2009, the Internet Movie Database listed child actor Charlie Tahan playing the role of Sam. See: . Accessed 2009-10-25. Efron wrapped his scenes in late October 2009. Rolfe Kent wrote the score, with Tony Blondal orchestrating. It was recorded at Skywalker Sound, Marin County, California.

Critical response  The film received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 27% approval rating based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 4.58/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Zac Efron gives it his all, but Charlie St. Cloud is too shallow and cloying to offer much more than eye candy for his fans.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. A.O. Scott of The New York Times commended Efron for having \\"a pleasant enough blend of geniality and melancholy\\" in the title role and cinematographer Enrique Chediak for giving the scenery a \\"convincingly romantic look and mood\\", but found the film overall conflicted with being a supernatural romantic drama that plays like a horror movie in certain places, concluding that \\"you are supposed to be transported beyond skepticism on a wave of pure, tacky feeling. Instead, in this case, you drown in sentimental, ghoulish nonsense.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a \\"C–\\" grade, criticizing Efron's pretty boy facials for not displaying the character's emotional despair but \\"a fake-profound, lost-idol tranquility.\\" The Guardians Peter Bradshaw said, \\"Like a high-jumper cracking the bar in two with his forehead, former teen star Zac Efron fails to make it into the Mature Performer league in this unendurable romantic drama, filmed in the buttery late-summer glow I associate with movies such as Message in a Bottle and The Notebook.\\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote that Efron lacked suitable material to make his character interesting and that Steers' direction \\"cares not for pacing [or] depth or the power of real emotion\\", saying \\"the movie is very much dead already. It has no pulse, no apparent breath, and a curious odor seems to waft from the screen not long after Charlie and Sam win a race together in the opening scene.\\" Mark Jenkins of NPR felt the film lacked \\"genuine emotion\\" to backup its concept and that Efron was miscast in the title character role, concluding that, \\"[U]nlike The Lovely Bones, this film doesn't attempt to show the afterlife as experienced by those who die too young. But then, who needs Heaven when you live in a picturesque sailing village in Microsoftland? Charlie St. Cloud may be a tale of loss, but its characters seem to have everything they could possibly want.\\"  Awards  Efron was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for Choice Summer Movie Star - Male and an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for his work in the film, but they both went to Robert Pattinson for The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. Tahan was nominated for Best Performance by a Younger Actor at the 37th Saturn Awards, but lost the award to Chloë Grace Moretz for Let Me In.

She was the wife of John Charleton, 4th Baron Cherleton. Family Lady Alice was born in Arundel Castle, Sussex in 1378, one of the seven children of Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel by his first wife Elizabeth de Bohun. She had two brothers, including Thomas Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, and four sisters, Lady Eleanor FitzAlan, Lady Elizabeth FitzAlan, Lady Joan FitzAlan, and Lady Margaret FitzAlan.

On 21 September 1397, her father was executed at Tower Hill, Cheapside for high treason against King Richard II of England.  Marriage and love affair  Sometime before March 1392 Alice married John Cherleton, 4th Lord Cherleton (25 April 1362 – 19 October 1401).Charles Cawley, Medieval Lands, Earls of Arundel According to popular belief, following her marriage she became the mistress of Cardinal Henry Beaufort, and bore him an illegitimate daughter, Jane Beaufort.R. A. Griffiths, Conquerors and Conquered in Medieval Wales, 1994. In Philip Yorke's The Royal Tribes of Wales, he states that Cardinal Beaufort left an illegitimate daughter by Alice, daughter of Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel.Yorke, p. 88. Genealogist Douglas Richardson also mentions the alleged affair between Alice and the Cardinal. According to Richardson, there is \\"no contemporary evidence that Alice was either the mistress of Henry Beaufort, or that she was the mother of his illegitimate daughter, Joan, born say 1390.\\"Douglas Richardson, Royal Ancestry: A Study in Colonial & Medieval Families, volume 5, page 52, note 4. Furthermore, the earliest appearance of the claim that Alice was the girl's mother is in The Winning of the Lordship of Glamorgan, written by a later Sir Edward Stradling, a descendant, between 1561 and 1566. Beaufort did indeed father an illegitimate daughter, Joan Beaufort, possibly before Henry took holy orders on 7 April 1397. Joan and Sir Edward Stradling had three sons and a daughter, Katherine. Alice's husband died on 19 October 1401, and she herself died before October 1415 around the age of 37.

In his excitement, he leaps into the river. His body and suicide note are discovered the next day. *\\"Such Perfection\\": A story about a sculptor who finishes a statue after five years of labor. It is a statue of the god Nataraja, and everyone insists its form is perfect; so perfect that if the people saw it, the glory of the god would consume them. The priest asks the sculptor to break off its little toe so that it will be safe to view, but the sculptor won't do it. The priest thus refuses to consecrate it in the temple. The sculptor turns his house into a temple to have it consecrated there. The god then comes to life and rattles the region with every kind of natural disaster. The people beg the sculptor to mar the statue's perfection after so many lives were lost, but he won't.

The imperfect statue is consecrated at the temple, and the sculptor gives up his trade. *\\"Father's Help\\": A story about Swami, a character from his first novel \\"Swami and Friends\\". Swami oversleeps on Monday and convinces his mother to let him stay home from school. His father insists he still go to school with a \\"headache,\\" so Swami lies and says his teacher Samuel beats children severely for lateness or any small offense. His father writes a letter for Swami to deliver to the headmaster and sends him to school. The letter will surely get Samuel fired, maybe even imprisoned. At school, Swami provokes Samuel to do something deserving of getting fired. But Samuel only canes his hands a few times, which Swami doesn't even react to. When he tries to deliver the letter to the headmaster, he is on leave all week. The assistant headmaster could accept it, but it's Samuel. Swami runs home without delivering the letter. His father thinks he was lying about the headmaster being on leave and says he deserves Samuel. *\\"The Snake-Song\\": A story about the Talkative Man. A group of men leave a concert hall having enjoyed the performance, but the Talkative Man looked tortured. He says taste has sunk and tells his story. He studied the bamboo flute with a master musician (who is so obscure his name is unknown, of course). A beggar interrupts the Talkative Man's practice at night and asks him for food. He declines the beggar even the right to come in and listen to him practicing. The beggar curses him, saying this was his last day of music. Later that night, a massive cobra comes and listens to him play. It gets agitated when he stops or plays anything other than the snake-song. After playing the same song all night, he throws himself prostrate and begs the snake to spare him. When he looks up, it is gone. The Talkative Man says he gave up his flute, but if he could find the beggar and ask forgiveness, he would take up his flute again. *\\"Engine Trouble\\": Another story about the Talkative Man. A carnival comes to town, and he wins a road engine (steam-powered tractor). Not knowing even how to drive or power the road engine, he simply leaves it in the park. The city starts to fine him for the parking space at over double his home rent. He arranges to move it, but it crashes in a wall instead, leaving him to pay for the damages. A swami comes to town, eating glass, burying himself alive, etc. The swami asks for a road engine for his assistant to run over his chest, but the city magistrate refuses to allow it. After a massive earthquake, the road engine lodges in a well owned by the same man whose wall was destroyed. He thanks the Talkative Man, as the city was going to fine him for the dirty water if it wasn't sealed. Of course, you can't see the engine lodged in the well anymore, as it is now sealed with concrete. *\\"Forty-Five A Month\\": A story about a daughter, Shanta, and her father, Venkat Rao.

He feels guilty that he stays at work till after his daughter goes to bed, seven days a week. So when Shanta asks to be taken to the cinema, he promises to take her. That afternoon, he asks his boss for personal leave or else he resigns. His boss tells him nothing is more urgent than work, so he goes back to working. Fed up with being bought for forty rupees a month, he writes a letter of resignation. His boss tells him he got a raise to forty-five rupees a month, so he tears up his letter. Venkat Rao gets home after his daughter falls asleep and tells his wife he can't take Shanta out at all since he got a raise. *\\"Out of Business\\" A story about Rama Rao, a man who had just lost his gramophone business as the only factory in the region closed down. Rama Rao looks for a local job, to no success. The family lay off their servants and rent out the house they built to live in a smaller abode. With no more job prospects, Rama Rao enters a magazine crossword contest, where everyone who gets every answer right wins 4000 rupees. After seeing how badly he lost, he lays down on the train tracks to die. After waiting too long, he finds a crowd at the station and hears that a derailment has delayed all trains three more hours.

Velan came from the poorest family in his village. At age 18, his father slapped his face in public, and he left. After a few days of walking and begging, he got a job as a gardener for an old man. The plot of land was large and they built a three-story mansion on it, but Velan lived in his hut on the grounds. After being awed by the mansion's construction, he grips a margosa's stem in his fingers and tells it to grow up big and worthy of the house or he will pluck it out. It does grow, and his master's great- grandchildren play under it and hundreds of birds live in its branches. Velan's master dies and the house trades hands with family members for some years until wear and tear make the house look haunted and no one will live in it, except Velan when he is given the keys. Some years later, a man arrives to say the plot has been bought and will be cleared for small housing. One morning, Velan awakes to the sound of men chopping the margosa tree with axes. He begs them to stop until he has gathered his belongings and gone out of earshot. *\\"Lawley Road\\" Another story about the Talkative Man. Just after India's independence, there was a flurry of patriotism. The municipality renamed streets from English things to Indian names. There was a statue of a Sir Frederick Lawley in town, and when the street bearing his name was changed, the municipality voted to remove the statue. The people also researched Lawley and found he had been a British tyrant over the Indians. When the city failed to find anyone to remove it within budget, the Talkative Man is offered the chance to take it for himself. He does and lodges it halfway inside his house with great difficulty. When he writes in the news how he got the statue, historical societies across India are outraged, as there are two Sir Lawleys, and the statue celebrated a kind man who founded Malgudi and even died to save Indians. The public protests the removal of the statue, but now neither the city nor the Talkative Man have funds to move it again. An election is coming, and if the statue problem is not returned to the city, the whole council will be voted out. The Chairman of Malgudi buys the Talkative Man's house with his private funds, converts the plot to a public park, and re-erects the statue. The road outside is renamed to Lawley Road. *\\"Trail of the Green Blazer\\" The story of a pickpocket who steals things for a living.

The Showmen's Guild was founded as the United Kingdom Van Dwellers Protection Association in 1889 in Salford. The formation of the guild was the main turning point of Showmen identifying their lifestyle as a culture rather than an occupation, leading to the idea of Travelling Showmen being a cultural group. Due to being an insular community, most marriages being within the community, their own language (called Paylaree), their own traditions and customs, and long lineages within the community, most Showmen identify as being part of their own unique cultural group. Due to travelling about, the average British Showman has a mix of English, Scottish, Welsh and/or Irish heritage. Lots have partial Romani (mainly Romanichal) and partial Irish Traveller heritage too, but despite this, Showmen developed as a group separately to both Irish Travellers and Romanichal Travellers, and their roots, cultures, traditions and identities are separate and distinct. In 1917, the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain, as it became known, was recognised as the trade association for the travelling funfair business. It acquired the right to represent the business at local and national levels. It exists to promote and protect the Showmen's way of life and to preserve the unique cultural heritage of travelling fairs and circuses. The Guild has a code of rules and also makes representations concerning proposed legislation when appropriate. It has a membership of around 4,700 people and is organized into ten regional sections. The current General Secretary, since April 2018, is Joe Mercer. It supports the National Fairground Archive, set up in 1994 at the University of Sheffield. The Showmen's Guild organizes fairs, such as St Giles' Fair in Oxford, co- organized with the Oxford City Council.

He is known from the 10th century military chronicle Shōmonki. Recruited to spy against his lord, the rebel Taira no Masakado, he was ultimately discovered and killed. Enlistment According to the Shōmonki, Masakado was embroiled in a bitter struggle with one of his uncles, Taira no Yoshikane. After suffering several defeats at Yoshikane's hands, Masakado retaliated with his own troops, forcing Yoshikane into hiding. It was at this time that the uncle, Yoshikane noticed the young Koharumaru, who was working as a messenger for Masakado, and who frequented the area near Yoshikane's home. Yoshikane summoned Koharumaru, and bribed the boy with \\"mounds of rice\\", clothing, and the prospect being given a better position as a mounted retainer. In exchange, Yoshikane asked for his cooperation in \\"devising a scheme to destroy Masakado\\", a proposal Koharumaru accepted. Assignment Koharumaru returned to his home, along with a farmhand Yoshikane had sent with him. Disguised as charcoal carriers, the two spied on Masakado's residence, collecting information on its armory, stable, gates, and Masakado's sleeping quarters before returning to Yoshikane. Having received this information, Yoshikane led his forces against Masakado's estate in a nighttime raid. However, their movement was picked up by one of Masakado's sentries, who warned his master beforehand. Prepared, Masakado led a successful counterattack and routed Yoshikane's troops.

A 2001 video release promotes the film as \\"The East German Grease\\" although perhaps it is closer in concept to the 1963 British movie Summer Holiday which starred Cliff Richard. Plot A group of girls and a separate group of boys come across each other whilst travelling from Leipzig to Ruegen Island for the summer holidays. Initially trying to ignore and avoid each other, the two groups find themselves billeted close by, relaxing together, enjoying each other's company and the resulting relationships that develop. The movie deals with the conflicts of each relationship in the group by singing and dancing their way through each situation including a brief encounter with the VoPo's - the police. The majority of the film is shot on Ruegen Island which at the time, was a popular destination for East Germans and today is popular with travellers the world over. Included are some early footage of Leipzig and East Berlin during the reconstruction and re-building era of the former GDR.

In describing reflection and refraction in optics, the plane of incidence (also called the incidence plane or the meridional plane) is the plane which contains the surface normal and the propagation vector of the incoming radiation. (In wave optics, the latter is the k-vector, or wavevector, of the incoming wave.) When reflection is specular, as it is for a mirror or other shiny surface, the reflected ray also lies in the plane of incidence; when refraction also occurs, the refracted ray lies in the same plane. The condition of co-planarity among incident ray, surface normal, and reflected ray (refracted ray) is known as the first law of reflection (first law of refraction, respectively). Polarizations The orientation of the incident light's polarization with respect to the plane of incidence has an important effect on the strength of the reflection. P-polarized light is incident linearly polarized light with polarization direction lying in the plane of incidence. S-polarized light has polarization perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The s in s-polarized comes from the German word senkrecht, meaning perpendicular. The strength of reflection from a surface is determined by the Fresnel equations, which are different for s- and p-polarized light.

At the founding meeting of PKI Merah, Djoni was elected chairman, Hoesin party secretary and Kasim treasurer of the party. The split in the PKI had been provoked by differences of opinion on Sardjono's leadership in the party, rather than polemics on theory. Djono had revolted against Sardjono's openness towards the possibility of entering into negotiations with the Netherlands, a position which Djono saw as a deviation from the revolutionary path.Soe, Hok Gie.

The variations of the name include Raya Rajput, Rava Rajput, Rawa Rajput and Rawad Rajput. Origin The Rajputs occasionally united against foreign invaders – once under Bappa Rawal, then under Shakti Kumar of Mewar and Jaypal Tomar. For 457 years (AD 736 to 1193 AD), Delhi was ruled by the Tanwar Rajputs. In 1009, the Tritya Rajput Sangh was formed by Jaipal Dev Tanwar (or Jaypal Tomar (1005 - 1021)) with the help of other Rajput clans and Kshatriya kingdoms. This army, supported by his son Kumarpal Dev Tanwar (or Kumarpal Tomar (1021-1051)) was built to fight Mahmud Ghaznavi. This army was named Rajput Wahini Dal and the Rajputs who constituted this army came to be known as Rawa Rajputs. The word Rawad is said to be an abbreviation of the words Rajput Wahini Dal or battalion of Rajputs. This Rawad became Rawa in due course, which is an adjective of these Rajputs. Subdivisions Rawa Rajputs are associated with only 6 of the 36 Rajput clans. The Vansh, Rishi Gotra & Shakhas of these clans are as follows : - TWO SURYAVANSHI CLANS : 1\\\\. _Gehlot/Sisodia_ (Vaishampayan gotra) - gahalot, ahaad/ahaadiyaan, baaliyaan & dhaakiyaan 2\\\\. _Kushwaha_ (Manu/Maanav gotra) - kushavaaha, deshavaal, kaushik & karakachh TWO CHANDRAVANSHI CLANS : 3\\\\. _Tanwar_ (Vyas gotra) - tanvar, sumaal, gandharv, moghaa, paatharaan, paandoo, chaudharaan, thakuraan, soorayaan, bharbhaaniyaa, sansaariyaa/chandsaariyaa, maalhayaan, bahue, rojhe, roliyaan, chaubiyaan, khose, chhanakate, katoch, beebe, jhab‍be, jhapaal, kapaasiyaa, dairwaar, jinwaar, kaaakteey, laakiyaan, laakhe & tibbal 4\\\\. _Yadu_ (Atri gotra) - yadu, paatalaan, khaariyaa, in‍doriyaa, chhokar/chochar & maahiyaan TWO AGNIVANSHI CLANS : 5\\\\. _Chauhan_ (Vats/Vakchhas gotra) - chauhaan, khaaree/khair, chanchal, kataaria, boodhiyaan, baadiyaan/baadhiyaan, gurood/gared, kanhaidaa/kaanhad, dhaariyaa, daahiwaal, gaangiyaan, sahcharaan/sachchraan & maakal/maakad/baakad/bhaakad 6\\\\. _Panwar_ (Vashishth gotra) - panvaar, tondak, vaashish‍thaan, ojalaan, daahariya, udiyaan, kiranapaal & bhatede Knowingly or unknowingly, people have started using these branches of the clans as gotra. This increases the chances of marriage within the same gotra which is otherwise prohibited. History In the whole period of Muslim perversion, there is only a single instance of a confederate action against the Ghaznavids when Durlabhraj Chauhan, Bhoj Paramara, Sandpal Shahi, Kalchuri Karna, Anahilla Chauhan, Mewar's Shakti Kumar, Gwalior's Kachchhapaghatas and almost 150 other kings of North India (who considered the Tomar kings of Delhi their chief), united themselves under the leadership of Kumarpal Tomar to fight against the enemy on the common front. In 1043, Kumarpal Tomar started a big campaign against Muslim invader Mawdud, grandson of Mahmud of Gazni. He conquered not only Hansi and Thanesar (Sthaneswar) but Kangra (Nagarkot) and whole of Punjab till they reached Lahore. He reinstalled statues of Hindu deities in every fort he won and kept a small army with one of his brother to take care. The army even besieged the forts of Lahore and Takishah (Takeshwar) and all the area between Lahore and Gwalior became Tomar territory. The Rawa Rajput clans have had many eminent rulers like Maharana Pratap, Prithviraj Chauhan, Ramshah Tomar, Rana Sanga, Anangpal Tomar, Raja Bhoj Parmara, Chahadpal Tomar, Sawai Jai Singh, Man Singh Tomar, to name a few. Rawa Rajputs are said to have settled in Uttar Pradesh and nearby areas during the rule of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. It is believed that the presence of Rawa Rajputs in parts of western UP & Delhi along with military in Meerut Cantt may have boosted the 1857 freedom struggle in siege of Delhi. Present culture Rawa Rajputs are Hindu and never converted to other religions like many Rajputs did. Their main deities are Devtas (spirits of the departed ancestors) whom they worship through the Thaan (a miniature hut like structure made on an elevated base). The Devtas are believed to be residing in the Thaan and hence the name \\"Devtao ka Thaan\\". They also worship their Gram Devtas (village deities). Most of them use the titles Singh & Verma as their surname. Some also add the name of their Clan/Subclan to their name. They speak Khari boli as well as standard Hindi. Rawa Rajputs still have Bhatt (charan) system in which the Bhatts keep the genealogical details of Rawa Rajputs. The Bhatts sing those records to Rawa Rajputs in their traditional style once a few years and also add names of the next generation in their Pothi (diary). Rawa Rajputs are very liberal in accepting any good change in comparison to ordinary Rajputs. They started widow remarriage among Rajputs, most of them are vegetarian, alcohol consumption is considered bad. Their literacy rate is also high as they built many of their own schools by contribution. The community has a caste council, known as the Rawa Sammelan, to deal with the problems within the community at the village and inter- village levels. This includes resolving disputes within the community. The caste council is headed by a Chaudhary. With time, settled agriculture became their primary occupation, along with animal husbandry. They live in multi- caste villages, but occupy their own distinct quarters. Rawa Rajputs are concentrated in the western districts of Uttar Pradesh - 4 villages (Chougama) around Budhana in Muzaffarnagar District 7 villages (Satgama) around Baghpat&Badot; in Meerut District 27 villages (Saitwada) around Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar District 85 villages/towns in Bijnor District and a few more nearby villages in these districts. Other concentrations occur in Western parts of Delhi that were once independent villages - Nangal Raya, Naraina, Basai Darapur, Khampur, Titarpur and Wazirpur. * References Category:Social groups of Uttar Pradesh Category:Rajput clans of Uttar Pradesh Category:Rajput clans ","title":"Rawe (Rajput clan)"},{"id":"24163150","text":"This is an incomplete, chronological list of films produced in the Khmer language in the 2000s.

PLI may either be open-ended (does not have a fixed ceiling) or close-ended (has an upper ceiling which is normally stipulated in the employment contract). Open-ended incentives are normally applicable to revenue-generating activities (e.g., sales), while close-ended incentives are associated with support functions (e.g., operations, human resources, administration, etc.) PLI vs other financial remuneration PLI vs Salary Salary is paid for the efforts that one puts in and PLI is paid for the results. Salary is paid in short, definitive cycles (e.g., weekly, monthly, fortnightly etc.) while PLI is paid in a longer cycle of monthly, quarterly or half-yearly, yearly. PLI vs Bonus Bonus is paid for the performance of the organization while PLI is paid for the individual's performance. Bonus is normally paid yearly or half- yearly. This is normally paid as a percentage of one's salary, or as a fixed amount, of the employee's individual performance. PLI vs Retention Bonus Some organizations give a retention bonus which is payable for the period that an employee stays back in the organization. This is paid for the value added by the employee by virtue of mere presence and not necessary for the efforts or work output. Normally retention bonus is paid yearly or half-yearly which will incentivise the employee to stay back in the organization for the payment PLI vs Appraisal Appraisals, normally conducted half-yearly or annually, are used to decide on the salary increments and promotions of the employee. These, being permanent increases, take both the performance and potential of the employee into account. Method of calculating PLI Also, in calculating PLI, only the performance and not the potential of the employee should be considered. Potential of the employee is normally subjective and can be contested. PLI should be based on metrics which are absolutely objective and clearly perceived as fair by both employee and employer.

In wartime, civilian property may be left behind or taken by the occupying state. In ancient times, such property was considered war loot, and the legal right of the winner. In the Fourth Geneva Convention Article 147, such action is defined as war crime: \\"Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the present Convention: willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a protected person, compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power, or willfully depriving a protected person of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in the present Convention, taking of hostages and extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.\\" Custodian of Enemy Property laws The following list is incomplete. Bangladesh: The Enemy Property Act was established to manage property of enemies (Indians) taken while it was part of Pakistan (1948–1971) or during its independence war (1971). Canada The Office of the Custodian of Enemy Property was established in 1916 and existed until 1985, dealing with the property of Canada's enemies in both World Wars as well as the seized property of Japanese Canadians. India: The Custodian for Enemy Property for India was established to manage Pakistani property taken in the Second Kashmir War (1965). Israel: The Absentees Property Law established the Office of the Israeli Custodian of Absentee Property to manage the property of absentee Palestinian refugees (including refugees who later became citizens of Israel, called \\"present absentees\\") of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War (1948). During the Six-Day War (1967), along with previously Palestinian properties, Israel took control of the Jewish property held by the Jordanian Custodian for Enemy Property and put it under the control of their own Custodian of Absentee Property. Most of this property remains under the Custodian, while some (as in the Sheikh Jarrah case) has been granted to Jews contesting ownership, after claiming it in court. Jordan: The Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property was established to handle property taken from Jews in the West Bank taken in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War (1948). In 1967, this function was disbanded (see above). United Kingdom: Custodian of Enemy Property. Previously under the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914 enemy property was inspected by the Board of Trade and ownership was transferred to the Public Trustee. Initially, the Public Trustee held ownership on trust for the enemy but after a 1916 amendment the Public Trustee was required to sell the assets and hold the proceeds in trust. Under the Trading with the Enemy Act 1939, three custodians were established: England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland.

They were the shorter and less powerful of the two 12-inch (305-mm) British RML guns, the other being the 35-ton gun.  Design  Mk I & II gun construction ram HMS Hotspur.  Mark I  Four guns were first made in 1866 with a toughened mild steel tube surrounded by multiple wrought iron coils on the original Armstrong pattern.  Mark II  While strong, the multiple coils were considered too expensive for construction in quantity. From 1867 guns were built on the simplified and hence cheaper \\"Fraser\\" system involving fewer but larger coils similar to the 10-inch (254-mm) Mk II gun. The guns were not considered a success, with the rifling twist of 1 in 100 increasing to 1 in 50 considered insufficient for accuracy, and guns were retubed in 11-inch (279-mm) calibre when their bores wore out.Treatise on Construction of Service Ordnance 1877, pages 92-94  Naval service  Guns were mounted on : * : 4 * : 4 * : 2 * : 2 * : 4 * : 4  Ammunition  When the gun was first introduced projectiles had several rows of \\"studs\\" which engaged with the gun's rifling to impart spin. Some time after 1878, \\"attached gas-checks\\" were fitted to the bases of the studded shells, reducing wear on the guns and improving their range and accuracy. Subsequently, \\"automatic gas-checks\\" were developed which could rotate shells, allowing the deployment of a new range of studless ammunition. Thus, any particular gun potentially operated with a mix of studded and studless ammunition. The gun's primary projectile was 600 to 608-pound (272- to 275-kilogram) \\"Palliser\\" armour-piercing shot, fired with a \\"Battering charge\\" of 85 pounds (38.5 kilograms) of \\"P\\" (gunpowder) or 67 pounds (30.4 kilograms) \\"R.L.G.\\" (gunpowder) for maximum velocity and hence penetrating power.

It runs through the suburbs of St Albans, Albion, Sunshine, Braybrook, Tottenham, Brooklyn, Kingsville and Yarraville. in its upper reaches Stony Creek's environmental state is very poor; it is best characterised as a concrete stormwater drain for these sections of its course. Through most of Sunshine it has been directed underground coming out at Matthews Hill Reserve. It then becomes a pleasantly treelined creek before passing through heavily industrialised areas. Stony Creek joins the Yarra River under the Westgate Bridge at the Stony Creek Backwash where it is fringed with mangroves. The Friends of Stony Creek is a group that works to restore native vegetation and protect the area. In April 2018, the Upper Stony Creek Transformation, a project to return a 1.2 km section of Stony Creek in Sunshine North to a natural, revegetated creek with vibrant community space and walking paths, commenced. This project is scheduled to be completed in September 2019. In July 2019 the Upper Stony Creek Transformation Project came to a standstill after project costs blew out following the discovery of industrial contamination at the site.

Opened in 1975, the 18 story-tower is owned by the Federal Government. The international style office building has more than of space. Designed by the Skidmore, Owings and Merrill architecture firm, the building is named after Wendell Wyatt and Edith Green who both served in the United States House of Representatives. History The Green – Wyatt building was constructed in the 1970s by Hoffman Construction Company under a $20 million contract. The new building opened in 1975. On June 21, 1989, an arson fire in the lobby caused $300,000 in damages, mostly from the sprinkler system that kept the night-time fire contained to the lobby area. Firefighters returned in February of the next year when a person trapped in an elevator inadvertently set off the fire alarm. Also that year, the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service moved out of the building and into Oregon's World Trade Center. The building suffered another fire in February 1993 when a discarded cigarette caused $25,000 in damage to insulation in the basement. All the occupants were evacuated during the late morning fire that had three alarms called, but was easily extinguished with a single bucket of water. At that time the building was valued at $120 million. In April 1995, the building was evacuated due to a bomb threat that suggested what happened at the Oklahoma City federal building would occur in Portland. No bomb was found, but the government later added additional security measures to the building that housed 1,200 workers in response to the bombing in Oklahoma City. Loriann J. Debray was later sentenced to three months in jail by federal judge Helen J. Frye for the incident. The new protective measures at the building included adding metal detectors and security guards, elimination of visitor parking in the building's basement, and other vehicles entering the building must show government identification. The building was targeted for another bomb threat in October 1995, but no bomb was found. On the one year anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, a piece from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was added to a memorial across the street at Terry Schrunk Plaza, which includes an underground parking structure for the Green-Wyatt Building. That structure was the planned assassination site of Charles H. Turner in the failed plot by members of the Rajneeshees in 1985 to kill Turner, the U.S. Attorney for Oregon who worked in the building. Building during renovations in April 2011 In May 2001, the building was closed for a day after power transformers blew out and knocked out electricity. A similar incident closed the building in February 2004. Green – Wyatt was closed again on September 11, 2001, in the wake of the attack on the World Trade Center in New York and the attack on the Pentagon. The building started a $133 million overhaul to improve efficiency and make the building more environmentally friendly in 2009. SERA Architects was the architect for the improvements with Cutler Anderson Architects as the Design Excellence consulting architect, which included a new exterior to the structure. PLACE studio was the landscape architect. Funding for the project came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Seattle based Howard S. Wright Companies was the construction manager with the project designed to achieve a LEED Platinum rating. The building re-opened in May 2013 after the $139 million remodel with an entirely new look that included a large solar panel on a tilted roof. The Building was named by the American institute of Architects' Committee on the Environment as one of the top 10 sustainable projects of 2015. Protests As the main presence of the federal government in Portland, it is often the site of protests against the government. These protests have included marchers against U.S. aid given to Israel in February 1988, veterans protesting the lack of funding for medical services provided by the Veterans Administration in January 1989, to those marching for a ban on testing nuclear weapons in August 1989. Other groups have rallied to end homelessness, as well as the Gulf War against Iraq in 1991 when nine protesters were arrested at the building. The bombing of Iraq in December 1998 led to further demonstrations, as did the invasion of Iraq in 2003 when seven protesters were arrested in March. left The George Floyd and police brutality protests in Portland were centered near the building. Details Original look of the building The 18-story building has of space and stands tall. Built of concrete and steel, the high-rise is in the international style of architecture. It was designed by the architecture firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Tenants of the building include the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, among others. Operated by the General Services Administration (GSA), the building also houses a G.S.A. Café. Parts of the building are also used to exhibit art works. Past exhibits have included those by Black artists during Black History Month and works by disabled artists. Namesakes The building is named after former members of Congress Edith Green (1910-1987) and Wendell Wyatt (1917-2009), who both left Congress in 1975. Wyatt was a native Oregonian who studied law at the University of Oregon before joining the FBI and Marine Corps. A veteran of World War II, he served as Congressman from Oregon's 1st congressional district for ten years as a Republican. Green grew up in Oregon and became a teacher after studying at Willamette University, the University of Oregon, and Stanford University.

In 432 they revolted from Athens, along with the Chalkidian League, but in 422 they entered in an alliance with the Athenians. It seems from the inscriptions that they had formed a confederacy (koinon) and struck silver and bronze coins. There were between six and twelve Bottiaean cities but not all of them inside Bottike.
