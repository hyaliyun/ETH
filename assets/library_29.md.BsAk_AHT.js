The vessel was launched on 11 April 1959 and completed in July. Registered under a flag of convenience in Monrovia upon entering service, Rhine Ore sailed until sold to Hall Corp Ltd. The ship was renamed Steelcliffe Hall after the April 1977 sale, it was rebuilt in Canada that year as a laker, with cargo space added forward of the engine room, and the wheelhouse moved aft above the crew accommodation. After decades of service and changes to the function and structural conversions of the ship, in 1988 Steelcliffe Hall was given the name Windoc (2) after being acquired by N. M. Paterson & Sons Ltd., following the liquidation of the previous owner, Halco. On 11 August 2001, while traveling through the Welland Canal, Windoc was hit by Bridge 11 in Allanburg, Ontario. The accident caused minor damage to the vertical lift bridge, and destroyed the ship's wheelhouse and funnel. The vessel caught fire, and was later declared a constructive total loss, but there were no reported injuries, no damage to the $6-$8 million cargo, and no pollution to the waterway.

Over the years, the Toronto Blue Jays have created three full-time mascots, all of which portray the bird for which the team was named. BJ Birdy was the team mascot from 1979 to 1999. For the 2000 season, BJ was replaced by Ace and Diamond, two new characters. Diamond was dropped at the end of the 2003 season, leaving Ace the sole mascot. In recent years, Ace has been joined on an occasional basis by Junior. This happens on \\"Junior Jays Sundays\\", formerly \\"Junior Jays Saturdays\\". Eras BJ Birdy (1979‚Äì1999) Kevin Shanahan was an employee of Ontario Place, a theme park attraction run by the provincial government of Ontario, located on Toronto's lakeshore across from municipally-run Exhibition Place, site of Exhibition Stadium, the team's home field at the time. As a University of Toronto student, Shanahan designed and performed in a moose costume at the park, to replace the more \\"motley-looking thing\\" they already had.The new moose cost $700 to make, whereas the Jay cost $250 to $300, \\"because this time I knew what I was doing.\\" (Patton, \\"Big Jay flaps for win\\".) The second moose costume was uncomfortable, so he designed a more comfortable bird costume. A friend suggested to him the Blue Jays might want a mascot. Not a baseball fan, he had never seen a live game. He commented \\"it didn't take me long to see why a mascot was needed. The game needs a distraction. Otherwise your mind wanders.\\" Shanahan was a part-time science student, before he later dropped out. Previously he had attended Michael Power High school, where he drew comics for the school newspaper. The team was working on a deal with CHUM Limited to develop a mascot character, after the Montreal Expos had added the character of Youppi! earlier in the year.The Expos' final season in Montreal was 2004. The team moved to Washington, D.C., and the rights to Youppi! were sold to the Montreal Canadiens. () In 1985, the BJ Birdy character was described as \\"lovable, irascible, curious, impudent, mischievous, and often the victim of his own impulsiveness.\\" Much of the routines were improvised. \\"B.J. is a reaction character. He's a fan. He wants to know what's going on. He'll duck behind a dugout and then pop up again. He does what a lot of fans would do if they weren't so reserved.\\" The costume had \\"perfect vision\\", and was said to be quite agile. During the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, 22-year-old Shanahan told the Star that he would lose $7000 if the whole season was cancelled.This was listed as being $110 a home game, plus licensing fees and outside appearances. He suggested he might return to Ontario Place, but worried the strike might permanently kill the character. During the strike, he rebuilt his Basil Beaver and Mickey Moose costume heads for Ontario Place, and received a contract to build six more animals in the autumn. By the end of the strike, he estimated a loss of $3600. The Globe and Mail reported a rumour that Shanahan would not be offered a new contract for 1986. The character and its actor had a continuously strained relationship with the team and some fans. When receiving complaints from the fans or media on his behavior at a game, the team front office would apparently reply \\"B.J. Who?\\" In 1985, he commented: \\"I'm always walking a fine wire. I found out early that Blue Jays won't back me up, that I'm on my own. So I'm on a balancing act.\\"In the book Yes, It's Hot in Here: Adventures in the Weird, Woolly World of Sports Mascots (2014), former Mr. Met A.J. Mass noted that Shanahan would regularly verbally answer the questions of the public, contrary to standard procedure for mascots. As it set precedent, it would make other performers look inaccurately standoffish in comparison. () On the move to SkyDome, \\"BJ Birdy\\" told the Star that the team should keep prices as is. On April 1, 1985, the first BJ Birdy comic ran in the Toronto Star, created by Shanahan. In a preview article, he commented on the character: \\"I see him as an underbird but he'll definitely be his own bird. He'll get the odd quip in his favor, he'll second-guess like fans do but, most of the time, everything will fall back on him. Of course, he might develop into something totally different. I have ideas but that isn't to say they and B.J. won't change. Situations that B.J. got into at the stadium were limited but this way the sky's the limit. He can fall off stadiums, go through walls, do silly, little things. There's total freedom.\\" The character often criticized Jays management. The Globe noted that fans \\"had grown abusive. Broadcasters question the reason for his existence. The team's front office offers only middling support.\\" The newspaper noted a negative bent to the comic, with many strips taking shots at those groups. When Paul Beeston was asked about his opinion on a strip centering on him, vice president he commented \\"What comic strip? I didn't know he had one.\\" In another strip, BJ Birdy's mother is about to hit mascot-hating broadcaster Tony Kubek on the head. He commented that the strip was based on real situations, \\"when I distort something, I only tone it down.\\" Despite‚Äîor perhaps because of‚Äîits controversial nature, the comic was not successful, and was soon cancelled. BJ Birdy gained wider notoriety on May 22, 1993, when he was ejected from a Blue Jays game against the Minnesota Twins for trying to influence an umpire's call on a caught line drive. In the bottom of the first inning, umpire Jim McKean ruled that Twins infielder David McCarty didn't catch a line drive hit by Roberto Alomar, ruling the play a hit. Although the ruling favoured his team, BJ Birdy was caught up in the excitement of the play and attempted to get the crowd to make the \\"hit\\" ruling just as McKean was actually making the ruling. McKean still took exception to the antic, ejecting BJ Birdy from the game, which the Jays still won 7‚Äì0. Over the character's final seasons, Shanahan suggested that Jays management turned down multiple appearance requests for BJ Birdy. The Raptor, mascot of the Toronto Raptors basketball team, was meanwhile gaining acclaim for his acrobatic routines. The Jays noted the admiration for the NBA team's \\"total entertainment package\\". The team had its second lowest opening day attendance in 1999, desperately trying to attract audiences. The Star commented that the team's desperation was evident, suggesting that \\"the nadir probably reached when a van circled the field pulling a flatbed which bore B.J. Birdy, a massive plastic rodent, two dancing bears and a man firing T-shirts into the stands with a bazooka.\\" Shanahan retained ownership of the character, despite initial attempts to sell the rights and costume to the club. Shanahan was called into a meeting with the senior vice-president of marketing for the Toronto Blue Jays, Terry Zuk; the two apparently had not met before. He was told he was being replaced by two new mascots. Shanahan again offered to sell the costume and copyrights, but the club declined. The team suggested, if it were too hard to hold onto the costume, the Jays Care Foundation would gladly accept a donation; he flatly refused. It was also suggested Shanahan might be interested in training the new performers. Seeking legal advice, he informed the club the new mascots could not debut before his contract expired on December 31, well after the season's end. In response, the club called him at his home in Mississauga, telling him not to appear at the final two regular season home games; he would quip to the media that they were the first \\"two paid days off after 20 years.\\" In early December, the story about BJ Birdy's two replacements made the news. Shanahan commented that \\"there's not a great deal of pain in this. I had a good run. But it bothers me that the Jays talked about it before my contract was up. They gave their word they'd wait until December 31.\\" General Manager Gord Ash contested that \\"there was no intent to reveal that. We were confronted with the story, it was out from another source and there was no sense having a bunker mentality and denying it.\\" Ace (2000‚Äìpresent) and Diamond (2000‚Äì2003) Ace appears at Rogers Centre in 2006. Quickly, some in the sports media asked \\"Double the pleasure? Or, double the pain?\\" News of a naming contest led to suggestions like Swing and A Miss, More and Annoying, and Bird and Brain. For their part, the Globe issued an editorial calling the situation \\"a baseball civics lesson\\", suggesting that no one asked the public, \\"and when you don't ask citizens of a democracy if they want an icon to be changed you must expect them to rise up in revolution... or at least cry out: Give us back our bird.\\" As of early December 1999, four people expressed interest in applying, three of them from the United States. By the first round of auditions on January 10, 2000, the club had received about 70 applications. The characters themselves were conceived and designed by Kelly Giannopoulos and Diane Semark. \\"We looked for the most interesting personality traits and then actually gave the mascots a past, a sort of legend that went with their story.\\" The duo were designed with distinct plummage and faces, to reflect their gender. Sugar's Costume Studio built the outfits based on their designs. Their personality traits were modelled after Jim Carrey and Goldie Hawn, because \\"both of them have a wild and zany side.\\"Ironically, in a 1996 article, the Raptors performer listed Carrey and Charlie Chaplin as his inspirations. Their original names were Slider and Curveball. On March 4, 2000, two new names were unveiled through the Toronto Blue Jays \\"Name the Mascots Contest\\" ACE and DIAMOND. Winner of contest: Toronto High School Student A. McConnell The costumes were built by Sugar's Mascot Costumes in Toronto. An early article suggested they would wear varied clothes; \\"tuxedos for formal events and surgical garb for hospital visits.\\" The new costumes were lightweight and featured athletic pants to allow for stunts. Brennan Anderson played Ace for five years, bringing his competitive gymnastics and media background. He later became a sales manager at Sugar's. Diamond performers included then-Ryerson University student Angelina Milanovic, University of Toronto musical theatre student Larissa Bathgate,http://www.cab- acr.ca/english/media/news/03/nr_oct2903.pdf and Amanda Barker. Ace became sole mascot of the Blue Jays in 2004, after the team removed Diamond before the season opened. Ace's jersey number is double zero. A second blue jay mascot, named Junior, is present on \\"Junior Jays days\\", usually Saturdays home games, when children are invited to run the bases after the games. Junior's number is 1/2 (half).

A special flower called \\"Chengazhinir Poovu\\" which is traditionally used as offering to deity is found and grown only in the temple pond. This temple was depicted in the Malayalam movie Neelathamera, though the film was recorded elsewhere as no permission was given to shoot the film on the temple premises. Name Temple name is variously spelled as 'Mala-Mel-Kavu', 'Mala-Mal-kavu' or 'Mala-yil-Kavu'. They all mean \\"A temple (Kavu) located on top (Mel) of a small hill(Mala)\\". All spellings are correct, but the second one of these is used in the official temple sign board. Location The temple is located in Malamakkavu Desom. But the temple is not, as the name suggests, situated on top of a hill, but is located relatively lower in the region. This area is famous for its Thayambaka, a traditional percussion music instrument used in temple festivals. Legend of establishment View of Malamakkavu Ayyappa Temple and temple pond, facing west The legend, which the temple shares with many other temples across Kerala is that, many hundreds of years ago a Cherumi couple chanced upon a divine rock while grazing the forest with their live- stock. The rock bled blood upon being struck with a sickle and thus its divinity was made apparent to all. Soon word went around of the discovery of a divine entity in the forest and the deity was formally instated in a specially made sanctum. A small temple (Kavu) was established around the idol. Not much historic records exist to authenticate the antiquity of the temple, but written records exist which prove that the temple is more than 300 years old.  Temple and its surroundings  View of temple facing eastThe temple is one of the 108 Ayyappan temples in Kerala. Its main idol, Ayyappan is oriented to the east so that offerings can be made. Other idols are Bhagavathi and Lord Siva. The temple's festival, \\"Thalapoli\\" is celebrated on the last Saturday of the month of Dhanu. The temple is owned and managed by the Zamindar family of Padinjarepat Nambiar clan. Temple pond is situated to the east of the premises. Legends say that, if one prays with full heart and places offerings at the feet of the lord Ayyappa, the \\"Chengazhi Neer\\" flower, also known as \\"Neelathamara\\", will bloom the very next day in the temple pond as a sign of God's blessing. This legend associated with Malamakkavu Ayyappa temple plays a pivotal role in the film Neelathamara. Thiyattu Nambiars, who has the right to conduct the Thiyattu ceremony in Ayappan temples has a branch in Malamakkavu, where they live in the vicinity of Malamakkavu Temple. Famous writer and Jnanpith award winner, M T Vasudevan Nair was born in Koodallur and did his primary schooling from Malamakkavu UP School. He is the author of the story based on which the movie \\"Neelathamara\\" is conceived. Through M T's writing, this quiet hamlet has found fame in Kerala's literary imagination.

Route 66 was built a half mile north of the community, one of the general stores moved to the highway. The rest of the hamlet was soon abandoned and the structures vanished. The store on the highway has changed owners and locations several times, but is still known as the Heyburn store.RootsWeb.

Lee Salmon Crandall (May 11, 1832 - September 13, 1926) was born in South Berlin, New York. As a young man he moved to Louisiana, where he married and made his home. Crandall entered the Confederate Army as captain of Company I, 8th Louisiana Infantry Regiment, and he led his company in the first Battle of Manassas. He was with General Stonewall Jackson through the Valley Campaign in Virginia, and was wounded in the wrist at the Battle of Cross Keys. He was promoted to major, and later was ordered to report to Major General Sterling Price at Little Rock, Arkansas. He was captured during Price's Missouri raid and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner at Johnson's Island, Ohio. Service The 47th Arkansas Mounted Infantry was assigned to Colonel Thomas H. McCray's brigade and operated as part of General Shelby's division in northeast Arkansas in the summer of 1864. The regiments organized by Colonel McCray were apparently ready for operations by July 25, 1864, when Brigadier General Shelby ordered McCray's Brigade to move south and attack the railroad near Brownsville, in current day Lonoke County, Arkansas.United States.

It is unclear who was the commander of the 48th Arkansas or which counties the regiment was recruited from. There are no surviving muster rolls for the regiment; in fact the only documentation that exists for the unit is a list of prisoners captured on October 24, 1864, at Mound City, Kansas,Gerdes, Edward G.: 48TH ARKANSAS CAVALRY REGIMENT\\", Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, Accessed 13 January 2012, http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/48thcav.html during Price's Raid. Since General Sterling Price generally referred to his units by the name of the unit commander, the reports from Price's raid rarely contain the numerical designation of the unit. Because the names of the other 40 series regimental commanders are known, some historians have speculated that the 48th may have been the numerical designation of Colonel Charles H. Carlton's regiment. Like the other 40 series regiments, Carlton's regiment was raised in the summer of 1864. The only numerical designation known to be associated with the Carlton's regiment is the 28th Arkansas Cavalry. Another 40 series regiment, Colonel James H. McGhee's 44th Arkansas Infantry (Mounted) was also previously known as the 29th Arkansas Cavalry Regiment. Another possibility for the identity of the 48th is a former infantry unit which was mounted for Price's Raid, Colonel James W. Rogan's 30th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. The decreasing availability of fodder for horses in 1864 led the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department to issue an order proscribing the raising of additional mounted regiments in Arkansas. However, when General Sterling Price received authorization to conduct a campaign in Missouri that fall, several of the new regiments were mounted in order to accompany him. As a result, the 44th, 45th, 46th, 47th, and 48th were officially mounted infantry regiments instead of cavalry regiments. They were rarely referred to in contemporary reports and orders by numerical designation. Price referred to them as McGehee's Cavalry, Crabtree's Cavalry, etc., which eventually resulted in their later being referred to as 44th Cavalry, 46th Cavalry, etc.Howerton, Bryan R.: \\"Re: 46th Ark.

Greeno, of the 4th Arkansas Cavalry (U. S. Army), dated November 15, 1864, made from Devalls Bluff relayed information on the post raid condition of the Arkansas cavalry regiments. Major Greeno had just learned from deserters and captured Confederate soldiers who had served in Price's Army that survivors were en route by way of White River to northeast Arkansas. His description of the morale of the men in this regiment, as well as the others, was probably very accurate:A Brief History of the 45th Arkansas Cavalry Regiment, C.S.A., by James Logan Morgan; The Stream of History, Volumen 16, Part 4 (Oct. 1978).

Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson, Commander of the Military Sub-District of Northeast Arkansas and Southeast Missouri, surrendered his command at Chalk Bluff, Arkansas, on May 11, 1865, and agreed to have his men assemble at Wittsburg and Jacksonport, Arkansas, to lay down their arms and receive their paroles. Thompson's command was widely dispersed throughout northeast Arkansas, more for reasons of available forage than anything else. About a third of his men refused to surrender. Shelby's Missouri Brigade, along with elements of Green's and Jackman's Missouri Brigades, left for Mexico. Some Missouri units disbanded rather than surrender their colors. Many men simply went home. The 44th, 45th, 46th and 47th Arkansas Cavalry regiments surrendered with their command structure intact and were paroled at Jacksonport on June 5, 1865.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Jacksonport 1865 surrender list?\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 1 January 2004, Accessed 1 January 2012, http://history- sites.com/mb/cw/arcwmb/archive_index.cgi?noframes;read=6006 See also *List of Arkansas Civil War Confederate units *Lists of American Civil War Regiments by State *Confederate Units by State *Arkansas in the American Civil War *Arkansas Militia in the Civil War References Bibliography * Allen, Desmond Walls.

Its aim is to ensure that all people in low- and middle-income countries can choose, obtain and use the supplies and appropriate services they need to safeguard their reproductive health. Since 2004, the Coalition has been part of international efforts to secure reproductive health supplies by increasing resources, strengthening systems, and building effective partnerships.  History  Since the 1970s, the international community has worked on providing access to the supplies and equipment needed to deliver quality reproductive health services in the developing world. In the early years, that engagement was largely financial and technical, focused in particular on effective supply chain management. By the late 1990s waning interest within the international donor community coupled with weak commitment by countries prompted many to see sustained access to reproductive health supplies as depending as much on effective advocacy as on purely technical support. Alarmed at the prospect of significant funding shortfalls, stakeholders from around the world met in 2001 in Istanbul at a conference entitled \\"Meeting the Challenge\\".Contraceptive Projections and the Donor Gap (April 2001). Interim Working Group on Reproductive Health Commodity Security. . This conference was the starting point for a coordinated global reproductive health supplies movement. In 2003 the Supply Initiative was established as a coordinating mechanism. In 2004 12 organizations, mostly donors from the public and non-governmental sectors, established the Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition. Their aim was to foster better coordination and collaboration in such areas as global advocacy, resource mobilization, and supply chain strengthening. By the end of 2011 the Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition included 155 member organizations, among them developing country governments, international and national non- governmental organizations, civil society organizations, technical agencies, bilateral donors, multilateral organizations, private foundations, regional bodies, and manufacturers.

This includes contraceptives for family planning, drugs to treat sexually transmitted infections, and equipment such as that used for safe delivery. More specialized definitions of RH supplies have also been formulated. One of these is WHO's Interagency List of Essential Medicines for Reproductive Health (2006),World Health Organization (WHO) \\"The interagency list of essential medicines for reproductive health\\" (2006) by Department of Reproductive Health and Research and Department of Medicines Policy and Standards http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/general/RHR_2006_1/en/ which reflects the current international consensus on essential medicines for the provision of quality RH services. Because the list prioritizes medicines believed to address the most pressing public health problems, it is by definition, selective. Nonetheless, it does include a broad range of contraceptives, drugs to prevent and treat sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, and medicines to ensure healthy pregnancy and delivery. The Interagency List is a subset of the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines,World Health Organization (WHO) \\"Model Lists of Essential Medicines\\"; 17th WHO Essential Medicines List and the 3rd WHO Essential Medicines List for Children updated in March 2011 http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en updated every two years since 1977. The 17th edition of the Essentials Medicines List (EML) was last published in 2011. To assist countries who formulate their own lists of essential RH supplies, based on local needs, the Coalition partners WHO, UNFPA and PATH published the Essential Medicines for Reproductive Health: Guiding Principles for their inclusion on National Medicines Lists (2006).  Threats to reproductive health commodity security  Worldwide, the availability of reproductive health (RH) supplies, including contraceptives, medicines for prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, and medicines to ensure healthy pregnancy and delivery, falls short of current demands.IPS \\"Another Push for Reproductive Rights\\" by Pam Johnson, June 17, 2011 http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=56134 No single set of factors can fully explain this reality, but the three factors are of particular significance: *Limited resources: The demand for reproductive health supplies is greater than ever and with the share of development assistance dropping, ensuring adequate donor resources has become critical to meeting the supply challenge.http://www.globalissues.org/news/2011/06/17/10142 *Inadequate systems: With more responsibilities brought by a shift towards greater country ownership of the development process, it is more and more difficult to find a way through an environment that is more and more complex. *Lack of coordination: Coordination and harmonization of tools at the global level are necessary to combat against resource shortfalls and failing to make the most of existing resources. Global political will and advocacy are critical to give priority to reproductive health.  Strategic Pillars  Achieving The Coalition's vision will not occur without certain conditions being met: that supplies actually reach those who need them most; that the supplies are affordable and within the reach of all; that supplies and products are of trusted quality; and that there is a sufficient choice of supplies to meet users' needs. These four broad preconditions‚Äîavailability, equity, quality, and choice‚Äîare the Strategic Pillars. *Availability: The ability of women and men to obtain safe, affordable supplies that meet their reproductive health needs. Supply availability exists when products feed into the supply chain and successfully make their way to the point-of-distribution, where users can obtain them. *Quality: The ability of women and men to have supplies they can trust are both safe and effective. Good sexual and reproductive health depends on ensuring the quality of all reproductive health supplies. *Equity: The ability of all people to have equitable access to reproductive health supplies. Age, economic well-being, gender, and civil status all have profound implications for the kinds of supplies potential users seek and the ability of users to afford them. The barriers impeding universal access to sexual and reproductive health must be overcome. *Choice: The ability of all who seek family planning services to have a broad range of options from which to choose. An individual's need for contraception evolves throughout his or her life cycle. Accessing the \\"right\\" contraceptive increases the likelihood reproductive health needs will be met; a mismatch, research shows, is more likely to lead to dissatisfaction, lower continuation rates, and often method failure.  Working Groups and other mechanisms for collaboration  Three Working Groups are the principal vehicles through which Coalition members collaborate. The Market Development Approaches (MDA) Working Group contributes to the goal of reproductive health supply security through a greater focus on the \\"total market\\", which includes the private and commercial sectors. The Advocacy and Accountability (A&A; WG) Working Group (formerly known as Resource Mobilization and Awareness Working Group RMA WG) contributes to the health and well-being of all individuals by ensuring they have access to RH commodities they want when they need them. The Systems Strengthening Working Group aims to strengthen the global, regional, and country systems needed to ensure a reliable and predictable supply of RH commodities, primarily in the public sector. In addition to the Working Groups the Coalition includes fora and caucuses dedicated to youth, maternal health supplies, generic manufacturers, and new and underused reproductive health technologies as well as regional fora for Latin America Foro Latinoamericano y del Caribe para el Aseguramiento de insumos de SR or LAC Forum and Francophone Africa S√©curit√© Contraceptive en Afrique Francophone SECONAF.  Services  Innovation Fund, made possible by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation makes available over US$2 million to enable member organizations to undertake activities in line with their Working Group's objectives, which would be otherwise unfunded.

Coordinated Assistance for RH Supplies (CARhs) CARhs brings together the world's commodity suppliers to address short-term supply crises. Through electronic data-sharing members identify existing or potential supply shortages and develop solutions. Between October 2009 and September 2010 CARhs addressed 184 separate supply crises and in the instances in which stock levels had dropped below minimal requirements, CARhs averted a stockout, either by issuing new shipments or providing policy advice. In 2010, such remedial efforts drove the procurement of more than $8.7 million in reproductive health commodities.

Reaching this goal will meet the family planning needs of 80 percent of women in low- and middle-income countries. It will mean 96 million fewer unintended pregnancies, 54 million fewer abortions, 110,000 fewer mothers dying in pregnancy and childbirth, and 1.4 million fewer infant deaths. The Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition is leading the effort by urging stakeholders in both the public and private sectors to commit resources and support to reach this goal.

They have autocrine, paracrine and/or endocrine effects; their systemic effects occur at picomolar concentrations. Receptors for myokines are found on muscle, fat, liver, pancreas, bone, heart, immune, and brain cells. The location of these receptors reflect the fact that myokines have multiple functions. Foremost, they are involved in exercise-associated metabolic changes, as well as in the metabolic changes following training adaptation. They also participate in tissue regeneration and repair, maintenance of healthy bodily functioning, immunomodulation; and cell signaling, expression and differentiation. History The definition and use of the term myokine first occurred in 2003. In 2008, the first myokine, myostatin, was identified. The gp130 receptor cytokine IL-6 (Interleukin 6) was the first myokine found to be secreted into the blood stream in response to muscle contractions. Functions In repetitive skeletal muscle contractions There is an emerging understanding of skeletal muscle as a secretory organ, and of myokines as mediators of physical fitness through the practice of regular physical exercise (aerobic exercise and strength training), as well as new awareness of the anti- inflammatory and thus disease prevention aspects of exercise. Different muscle fiber types ‚Äì slow twitch muscle fibers, oxidative muscle fibers, intermediate twitch muscle fibers, and fast twitch muscle fibers ‚Äì release different clusters of myokines during contraction. This implies that variation of exercise types, particularly aerobic training/endurance training and muscle contraction against resistance (strength training) may offer differing myokine-induced benefits. \\"Some myokines exert their effects within the muscle itself. Thus, myostatin, LIF, IL-6 and IL-7 are involved in muscle hypertrophy and myogenesis, whereas BDNF and IL-6 are involved in AMPK-mediated fat oxidation. IL-6 also appears to have systemic effects on the liver, adipose tissue and the immune system, and mediates crosstalk between intestinal L cells and pancreatic islets. Other myokines include the osteogenic factors IGF-1 and FGF-2; FSTL-1, which improves the endothelial function of the vascular system; and the PGC-1alpha-dependent myokine irisin, which drives brown fat-like development. Studies in the past few years suggest the existence of yet unidentified factors, secreted from muscle cells, which may influence cancer cell growth and pancreas function. Many proteins produced by skeletal muscle are dependent upon contraction; therefore, physical inactivity probably leads to an altered myokine response, which could provide a potential mechanism for the association between sedentary behaviour and many chronic diseases.\\" In brain functions related to neuroplasticity, memory, sleep and mood Physical exercise rapidly triggers substantial changes at the organismal level, including the secretion of myokines and metabolites by muscle cells. For instance, aerobic exercise in humans leads to significant structural alterations in the brain, while wheel-running in rodents promotes neurogenesis and improves synaptic transmission in particular in the hippocampus. Moreover, physical exercise triggers histone modifications and protein synthesis which ultimately positively influence mood and cognitive abilities. Notably, regular exercise is somewhat associated with a better sleep quality, which could be mediated by the muscle secretome. In regulating heart architecture Heart muscle is subject to two kinds of stress: physiologic stress, i.e. exercise; and pathologic stress, i.e. disease related. Likewise, the heart has two potential responses to either stress: cardiac hypertrophy, which is a normal, physiologic, adaptive growth; or cardiac remodeling, which is an abnormal, pathologic, maladaptive growth. Upon being subjected to either stress, the heart \\"chooses\\" to turn on one of the responses and turn off the other. If it has chosen the abnormal path, i.e. remodeling, exercise can reverse this choice by turning off remodeling and turning on hypertrophy. The mechanism for reversing this choice is the microRNA miR-222 in cardiac muscle cells, which exercise up-regulates via unknown myokines. miR-222 represses genes involved in fibrosis and cell-cycle control. In immunomodulation Immunomodulation and immunoregulation were a particular focus of early myokine research, as, according to Dr. Bente Klarlund Pedersen and her colleagues, \\"the interactions between exercise and the immune system provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the role of underlying endocrine and cytokine mechanisms.\\" Specific myokines Myostatin Both aerobic exercise and strength training (resistance exercise) attenuate myostatin expression, and myostatin inactivation potentiates the beneficial effects of endurance exercise on metabolism. Interleukins Aerobic exercise provokes a systemic cytokine response, including, for example, IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and IL-10 (Interleukin 10). IL-6 was serendipitously discovered as a myokine because of the observation that it increased in an exponential fashion proportional to the length of exercise and the amount of muscle mass engaged in the exercise. This increase is followed by the appearance of IL-1ra and the anti- inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In general, the cytokine response to exercise and sepsis differs with regard to TNF-Œ±. Thus, the cytokine response to exercise is not preceded by an increase in plasma-TNF-Œ±. Following exercise, the basal plasma IL-6 concentration may increase up to 100-fold, but less dramatic increases are more frequent. The exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6 occurs in an exponential manner and the peak IL-6 level is reached at the end of the exercise or shortly thereafter. It is the combination of mode, intensity, and duration of the exercise that determines the magnitude of the exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6. IL-6 had previously been classified as a proinflammatory cytokine. Therefore, it was first thought that the exercise-induced IL-6 response was related to muscle damage. However, it has become evident that eccentric exercise is not associated with a larger increase in plasma IL-6 than exercise involving concentric ‚Äúnondamaging‚Äù muscle contractions. This finding clearly demonstrates that muscle damage is not required to provoke an increase in plasma IL-6 during exercise. As a matter of fact, eccentric exercise may result in a delayed peak and a much slower decrease of plasma IL-6 during recovery. IL-6, among an increasing number of other recently identified myokines, thus remains an important topic of myokine research. It appears in muscle tissue and in the circulation during exercise at levels up to one hundred times basal rates, as noted, and is seen as having a beneficial impact on health and bodily functioning in most circumstances. P. Munoz-Canoves et al. write: \\"It appears consistently in the literature that IL-6, produced locally by different cell types, has a positive impact on the proliferative capacity of muscle stem cells. This physiological mechanism functions to provide enough muscle progenitors in situations that require a high number of these cells, such as during the processes of muscle regeneration and hypertrophic growth after an acute stimulus. IL-6 is also the founding member of the myokine family of muscle-produced cytokines. Indeed, muscle-produced IL-6 after repeated contractions also has important autocrine and paracrine benefits, acting as a myokine, in regulating energy metabolism, controlling, for example, metabolic functions and stimulating glucose production. It is important to note that these positive effects of IL-6 and other myokines are normally associated with its transient production and short-term action.\\" Interleukin 15 Interleukin-15 stimulates fat oxidation, glucose uptake, mitochondrial biogenesis and myogenesis in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In humans, basal concentrations of IL-15 and its alpha receptor (IL-15RŒ±) in blood have been inversely associated with physical inactivity and fat mass, particularly trunk fat mass. Moreover, in response to a single session of resistance exercise the IL-15/IL-15RŒ± complex has been related to myofibrillar protein synthesis (hypertrophy). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is also a myokine, though BDNF produced by contracting muscle is not released into circulation. Rather, BDNF produced in skeletal muscle appears to enhance the oxidation of fat. Skeletal muscle activation through exercise also contributes to an increase in BDNF secretion in the brain. A beneficial effect of BDNF on neuronal function has been noted in multiple studies. Dr. Pedersen writes, \\"Neurotrophins are a family of structurally related growth factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which exert many of their effects on neurons primarily through Trk receptor tyrosine kinases. Of these, BDNF and its receptor TrkB are most widely and abundantly expressed in the brain. However, recent studies show that BDNF is also expressed in non-neurogenic tissues, including skeletal muscle. BDNF has been shown to regulate neuronal development and to modulate synaptic plasticity. BDNF plays a key role in regulating survival, growth and maintenance of neurons, and BDNF has a bearing on learning and memory. However, BDNF has also been identified as a key component of the hypothalamic pathway that controls body mass and energy homeostasis. \\"Most recently, we have shown that BDNF appears to be a major player not only in central metabolic pathways but also as a regulator of metabolism in skeletal muscle. Hippocampal samples from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease donors show decreased BDNF expression and individuals with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease have low plasma levels of BDNF. Also, patients with major depression have lower levels of serum BDNF than normal control subjects. Other studies suggest that plasma BDNF is a biomarker of impaired memory and general cognitive function in ageing women and a low circulating BDNF level was recently shown to be an independent and robust biomarker of mortality risk in old women. Low levels of circulating BDNF are also found in obese individuals and those with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we have demonstrated that there is a cerebral output of BDNF and that this is inhibited during hyperglycaemic clamp conditions in humans. This last finding may explain the concomitant finding of low circulating levels of BDNF in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and the association between low plasma BDNF and the severity of insulin resistance. \\"BDNF appears to play a role in both neurobiology and metabolism. Studies have demonstrated that physical exercise may increase circulating BDNF levels in humans. To identify whether the brain is a source of BDNF during exercise, eight volunteers rowed for 4 h while simultaneous blood samples were obtained from the radial artery and the internal jugular vein. To further identify the putative cerebral region(s) responsible for BDNF release, mouse brains were dissected and analysed for BDNF mRNA expression following treadmill exercise. In humans, a BDNF release from the brain was observed at rest and increased 2- to 3-fold during exercise. Both at rest and during exercise, the brain contributed 70‚Äì80% of the circulating BDNF, while this contribution decreased following 1 h of recovery. In mice, exercise induced a 3- to 5-fold increase in BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus and cortex, peaking 2 h after the termination of exercise. These results suggest that the brain is a major but not the sole contributor to circulating BDNF. Moreover, the importance of the cortex and hippocampus as sources of plasma BDNF becomes even more prominent in the response to exercise.‚Äù With respect to studies of exercise and brain function, a 2010 report is of particular interest. Erickson et al. have shown that the volume of the anterior hippocampus increased by 2% in response to aerobic training in a randomized controlled trial with 120 older adults. The authors also summarize several previously-established research findings relating to exercise and brain function: (1) Aerobic exercise training increases grey and white matter volume in the prefrontal cortex of older adults and increases the functioning of key nodes in the executive control network. (2) Greater amounts of physical activity have been associated with sparing of prefrontal and temporal brain regions over a 9-y period, which reduces the risk for cognitive impairment. (3) Hippocampal and medial temporal lobe volumes are larger in higher-fit older adults (larger hippocampal volumes have been demonstrated to mediate improvements in spatial memory). (4) Exercise training increases cerebral blood volume and perfusion of the hippocampus. Regarding the 2010 study, the authors conclude: \\"We also demonstrate that increased hippocampal volume is associated with greater serum levels of BDNF, a mediator of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal volume declined in the control group, but higher preintervention fitness partially attenuated the decline, suggesting that fitness protects against volume loss. Caudate nucleus and thalamus volumes were unaffected by the intervention. These theoretically important findings indicate that aerobic exercise training is effective at reversing hippocampal volume loss in late adulthood, which is accompanied by improved memory function.\\" Decorin Decorin is an example of a proteoglycan which functions as a myokine. Kanzleiter et al have established that this myokine is secreted during muscular contraction against resistance, and plays a role in muscle growth. They reported on July 1, 2014: \\"The small leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin has been described as a myokine for some time. However, its regulation and impact on skeletal muscle (had) not been investigated in detail. In (our recent) study, we report decorin to be differentially expressed and released in response to muscle contraction using different approaches. Decorin is released from contracting human myotubes, and circulating decorin levels are increased in response to acute resistance exercise in humans. Moreover, decorin expression in skeletal muscle is increased in humans and mice after chronic training. Because decorin directly binds myostatin, a potent inhibitor of muscle growth, we investigated a potential function of decorin in the regulation of skeletal muscle growth. In vivo overexpression of decorin in murine skeletal muscle promoted expression of the pro-myogenic factor Mighty, which is negatively regulated by myostatin. We also found Myod1 and follistatin to be increased in response to decorin overexpression. Moreover, muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases atrogin1 and MuRF1, which are involved in atrophic pathways, were reduced by decorin overexpression. In summary, our findings suggest that decorin secreted from myotubes in response to exercise is involved in the regulation of muscle hypertrophy and hence could play a role in exercise-related restructuring processes of skeletal muscle.\\" Irisin Discovery  Irisin is a cleaved version of FNDC5. Bostr√∂m and coworkers named the cleaved product irisin, after the Greek messenger goddess Iris. FNDC5 was initially discovered in 2002 by two independent groups of researchers.  Function  Irisin (fibronectin type III domain- containing protein 5 or FNDC5), a recently described myokine hormone produced and secreted by acutely exercising skeletal muscles, is thought to bind white adipose tissue cells via undetermined receptors. Irisin has been reported to promote a brown adipose tissue-like phenotype upon white adipose tissue by increasing cellular mitochondrial density and expression of uncoupling protein-1, thereby increasing adipose tissue energy expenditure via thermogenesis. This is considered important, because excess visceral adipose tissue in particular distorts the whole body energy homeostasis, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and raises exposure to a milieu of adipose tissue-secreted hormones (adipokines) that promote inflammation and cellular aging. The authors enquired whether the favorable impact of irisin on white adipose tissue might be associated with maintenance of telomere length, a well-established genetic marker in the aging process. They conclude that these data support the view that irisin may have a role in the modulation not only of energy balance but also the aging process. However, exogenous irisin may aid in heightening energy expenditure, and thus in reducing obesity. Bostr√∂m et al. reported on December 14, 2012: \\"Since the conservation of calories would likely provide an overall survival advantage for mammals, it appears paradoxical that exercise would stimulate the secretion of a polypeptide hormone that increases thermogenesis and energy expenditure. One explanation for the increased irisin expression with exercise in mouse and man may have evolved as a consequence of muscle contraction during shivering. Muscle secretion of a hormone that activates adipose thermogenesis during this process might provide a broader, more robust defense against hypothermia. The therapeutic potential of irisin is obvious. Exogenously administered irisin induces the browning of subcutaneous fat and thermogenesis, and it presumably could be prepared and delivered as an injectable polypeptide. Increased formation of brown or beige/brite fat has been shown to have anti-obesity, anti-diabetic effects in multiple murine models, and adult humans have significant deposits of UCP1-positive brown fat. (Our data show) that even relatively short treatments of obese mice with irisin improves glucose homeostasis and causes a small weight loss. Whether longer treatments with irisin and/or higher doses would cause more weight loss remains to be determined. The worldwide, explosive increase in obesity and diabetes strongly suggests exploring the clinical utility of irisin in these and related disorders. Another potentially important aspect of this work relates to other beneficial effects of exercise, especially in some diseases for which no effective treatments exist. The clinical data linking exercise with health benefits in many other diseases suggests that irisin could also have significant effects in these disorders.\\" While the murine findings reported by Bostr√∂m et al. appear encouraging, other researchers have questioned whether irisin operates in a similar manner in humans. For example, Timmons et al. noted that over 1,000 genes are upregulated by exercise and examined how expression of FNDC5 was affected by exercise in ~200 humans. They found that it was upregulated only in highly active elderly humans, casting doubt on the conclusions of Bostr√∂m et al. Further discussion of this issue can be found in the Wikipedia entry for irisin under the \\"function\\" heading.  Osteonectin (SPARC)  A novel myokine osteonectin, or SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), plays a vital role in bone mineralization, cell-matrix interactions, and collagen binding. Osteonectin inhibits tumorigenesis in mice. Osteonectin can be classed as a myokine, as it was found that even a single bout of exercise increased its expression and secretion in skeletal muscle in both mice and humans.

Some sources state that the unit was organized in the fall of 1863, but it is likely that the unit was organized during the summer of 1864 along with the 45th through the 48th Mounted Infantry Regiments. It is known that James H. McGehee began his military service in a volunteer militia company organized in the 30th Arkansas Militia Regiment in Crittenden County, Arkansas in April 1861.Arkansas Military Department Records, List of Commissioned Officers in State Militia 1827‚Äì1862, Microfilm Roll 00000038-8, Page 41 The Crittenden Rangers became Company C of the 6th Arkansas Cavalry Battalion, which was eventually expanded to a full regiment and designated the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment (Slemons's). It is unclear how long McGehee served with the 6th Battalion, but by January 1863 he was apparently a Captain commanding an unnamed, unattached company of cavalry which was operating along the Mississippi River, north of Memphis Tennessee. Captain McGehee stated in his after action report that he was acting under orders to reconnoiter the area, \\"burning cotton in that country and annoying the enemy on the Mississippi River\\" wherever possible. McGehee's primary target in these operations was Union shipping along the river. McGehee and his men were responsible for burning at least two steam ships. On January 6, 1863 McGehee's troops captured and burned steamboat Jacob Musselman\\"JANUARY 1863\\", Civil War Naval History, Accessed 28 January 2012, http://www.historycentral.com/navy/cwnavalhistory/January1863.html near Memphis, later they also intercepted and burned the steamer Grampus No. 2. The operations by McGehee led Union Official to make a raid and burn the homes of suspected bushwhackers in Mound City, and Hopefield Arkansas.Smith, Myron J. \\"Tinclads in the Civil War: Union light-draught gunboat operations on western waters, 1862-1865\\", (McFarland and Company, Jefferson, North Carolina, 2010), , Page 91, Accessed 28 January 2012 https://books.google.com/books?id=lmWLppXvSVoC&printsec;=frontcover&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;=McGehee&f;=false By September 1863, McGehee's Company had joined with other semi-independent companies under Colonel Archibald S. Dobbins to form Dobbins 1st Arkansas Cavalry Regiment. McGehee's Company became Company C, and probably remained with the regiment unit for the winter of 1863 when Colonel Dobbins was court- martialed and dismissed from the service because he refused to accept orders from General John S. Marmaduke because Marmaduke had killed Brigadier General L. M. Walker in a duel just before the Battle of Little Rock.Massey, James Monroe,: \\"Dobbins' 1st Arkansas Cavalry, C. S. A.\\" , Edward G.

In May 1864, General J. O. Shelby occupied northeast Arkansas, well behind Union Army lines. In early June 1864, General Shelby commissioned several officers to begin raising regiments in Northeast Arkansas. By June 13, Shelby reported to General Sterling Price that recruiting efforts were bearing fruit.Sellmeyer, Deryl P.: \\"Jo Shelby's Iron Brigade\\", Pelican Publishing Company, 2007, , page 184 The decreasing availability of fodder for horses in 1864 led the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department to issue an order proscribing the raising of additional mounted regiments in Arkansas. However, when General Sterling Price received authorization to conduct a campaign in Missouri that fall, several of the new regiments were mounted in order to accompany him. As a result, the 44th, 45th, 46th, 47th, and 48th were officially mounted infantry regiments instead of cavalry regiments. They were rarely referred to in contemporary reports and orders by numerical designation. Price referred to them as McGehee's Cavalry, Crabtree's Cavalry, etc., which eventually resulted in their later being referred to as 44th Cavalry, 46th Cavalry, etc.Howerton, Bryan R.: \\"Re: 46th Ark.

The novel was named by Hugh Macdonald as one of The Heralds \\"paperbacks of the week\\" in June 2001. Plot Dan Starkey is employed by legendary film star, Sean O'Toole, who is looking to escape his type cast action hero career and move into directing movies. Unfortunately, O'Toole is making a movie based on an infamous IRA member, nicknamed \\"The Colonel\\", and events soon lead to Starkey once again struggling to both protect his wife \\"Patricia\\" and illegitimate child \\"Little Stevie\\", while also keeping himself alive and writing. Reception The novel was well received, with reviewers praising Bateman's droll humour and attention to detail. In a review for The Herald, Hugh Macdonald stated that, while written fiction is often humorous without ever being laugh-out-loud funny, \\"Bateman can and does make me laugh\\" and found the novel to contain \\"Sharp-edged humour with a touch of suspense\\". Sue Leonard, reviewing for Books Ireland, called Bateman \\"the master of the fast- paced improbable satire\\" and stated that Shooting Sean \\"is packed full of humour and specializes in one liners\\". Leonard went on to say that \\"as in other Bateman novels the plot is so much larger than life as to be totally unbelievable\\" however does state that \\"in the hands of such a skilful writer this adds to the fun\\". She further states that she loves \\"Bateman's work for its strong construction, sharp satirical writing and inventive characterization\\" as well as his \\"attention to detail, and witty observation\\". RT√â also reviewed the novel, with Tom Grealis stating that the novel was \\"a funny and highly entertaining tale of narcotics, terrorism and eh, moviemaking\\". He does mention that \\"one thing that has to be pointed out about Shooting Sean is that the plot becomes somewhat ridiculous in the latter stages\\", following this with \\"[Bateman's] decision to go for suspense over characterization certainly panders to the mainstream, but it is a pandering one cannot but enjoy\\". Grealis also concluded that he found the novel to be \\"engaging, funny and eminently readable\\". Writing for Scottish newspaper, the Southern Reporter, Fiona Scott stated that Bateman \\"has become an absolute favourite\\" and that \\"Shooting Sean is my favourite so far\\". She states that \\"Bateman's droll Irish wit is ideal for this storyline\\", calling the novel as a whole simply \\"hilarious\\". Reviewing for Sprout Lore, reviewer David V.

It has been declared a Historic and Artistic Landmark of National Interest.  History  In 1401 the Council of One Hundred (Consell de Cent), the former government of Barcelona, decided to build the Hospital de la Santa Creu merging and centralizing six hospitals in the city. The complex, designed by Guillem d'Abriell, was planned on a grand scale in the form of four two- story wings surrounding a central patio. The east wing (1406), north wing (1406-1509) and the west wing (1509) were built. In spite of the elapsed time they all have the same layout: ground floor covered with curved vaults that are very low with brick plates and upper floor with a double-sloped wooden beam on lightly pointed diaphragm arches. In front of the three wings the galleries of the cloister were arranged, with rib vault (begun in 1406 by Guillem d'Abriell). During the 16th and early 17th centuries, one of the four wings was demolished, two more wings were added and another court was built adjacent to the first, and this still retains the monumental stairs that now give access to the Biblioteca de Catalunya. Cloister gallery In 1703, Antoni Viladomat, one of the most significant Catalan painters of the Baroque period painted the chapel of Saint Paul. In 1763, in front of the Casa de Convalesc√®ncia, the College of Surgeons (later Medical Faculty and now Royal Academy of Medicine of Catalonia) was built, by Ventura Rodr√≠guez. By the end of the 19th century, the hospital had become outdated because of the growth of the city and advances that had been made in medicine and hygiene, so it was moved to a new site at the Hospital de Sant Pau, built between 1902 and 1930. A month before the hospital was closed down in 1926, Antoni Gaud√≠ died here three days after he was hit by a tram. In 1926 the building was purchased by the City Council, who began restoring it. It now houses the Biblioteca de Catalunya (since 1939), the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (since 1931), the Escola Massana art school (since 1935) and two public libraries run by the Diputaci√≥ de Barcelona. On June 3, 1931 it was declared a Monument of National Historic and Artistic Interest.  Architecture  The oldest part of the Hospital de la Santa Creu is an impressive example of Catalan civil-Gothic architecture. The interior boasts several large vaulted halls. Also of note is the cross vaulted Galeria del pati, which borders the inner garden, and the arched entrance to the library at the patio, built in the sixteenth century.

The first was published from 30 July 1892 ‚Äì 25 May 1901 this comic was more satirical in nature like other early comics during its first run, also in this first run it absorbed another comic called Wonder in 1893. A second series ran from 26 December 1914 ‚Äì 16 May 1942 when it merged with Wonder which in turn merged with Radio Fun in 1953. This new comic was aimed much more at children than the previous Funny Wonder. In 1915 Funny Wonder began to have Charlie Chaplin appear on the cover. Funny Wonder was the first of Amalgamated Press' comics to have its own annual which ran from the edition dated 1935 until the one dated 1941, when it was ended due to the effects of World War II. During its run, the comic had 1404 issues and had merged with Jester (which had previously been included as a pull-out section in overseas editions) and Halfpenny Wonder.

The game features a rule for performing captures, making Onyx unique among connection games. The Onyx board is a grid of interlocking squares and triangles, with pieces played on the points of intersection (as in Go). Each side of the board comprises twelve points. Black tries to connect the two horizontal (black) sides with an unbroken chain of black pieces, while White tries to connect the two vertical (white) sides with an unbroken chain of white pieces. The first to do so wins the game. Onyx was featured in several issues of Abstract Games magazine edited by Kerry Handscomb. Game rules The initial setup has four black pieces and four white pieces pre-placed (see illustration). Black moves first by placing a black piece on any empty point of the board. White follows suit.Or, since moving first conveys an advantage, the pie rule can be invoked. This gives White the one-time option to switch sides after Black's first move. Turns continue to alternate. A piece can be place on the midpoint of a square only if all four corners of that square are currently unoccupied. Once placed, pieces do not move. Captured pieces are immediately removed from the game. Capture rule The rule for capturing allows a player to capture two enemy pieces in a single turn. All of the following conditions must be met: * the two enemy pieces occupy opposite corners of a square; * a third corner of the square is already occupied by a piece owned by the capturing player; * the square's midpoint is unoccupied. The capture is executed by placing a piece on the remaining unoccupied corner of the square. If the capturing move also simultaneously completes a second square on the board where the same conditions prevail, then the move results in the capture of four enemy pieces instead of two.This possibility arises since each corner of a square on the Onyx board, with exception of corners at the board's edge, is also a corner of a second, adjoining square. Observations: non-repeating positions Onyx has the interesting property that, despite having a capture rule, it seems positions never repeat in a normally played game. That is, if at least one player is trying to win then it does not appear to be possible to have an Onyx position where, after a number of moves have been made, some of which are captures resulting in the removal of pieces from the board, the game returns to the same position. It seems the only way a position can be repeated in Onyx is if both players conspire to bring this about. However, while experience indicates that positions do not repeat, it's not obvious why this is so. In fact, it may be possible to construct an Onyx position where, with correct play, the position will repeat after a number of moves. But such a position has never been discovered and it may be the case that it's impossible to create one. Therefore, one interesting challenge with Onyx is to construct a position that repeats with correct play or to prove that it is impossible to do so. Notation conventions Each point on the Onyx board, except for midpoints of squares, is notated by a letter followed by a number in a zig- zagging coordinate system. The midpoint of a square is described by two letters followed by two numbers that uniquely identify the square's corners. An asterisk (*) following a notated move indicates that one pair of pieces was captured; two asterisks (**) indicates that two pairs were captured. Variations * Open Variation. Instead of the initial setup shown, players can begin the game with the Onyx board empty.However, the standard setup with pre-placed pieces \\"tends to sharpen the play and results in more interesting positions\\". . * The Onyx board can be varied in size, with more or less than twelve points per side. The next highest board size that still allows the starting pieces to be placed centrally is 16√ó16.\\"A larger board results in more strategic depth but also a longer game. It seems a board [...] with twelve points along each side is ideal for this game.\\" . Some puzzles have been composed for Mini-Onyx boards having six points per side .

Human capital contracts have been advocated by a number of Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economists, including Milton Friedman, Robert Merton, and Gary Becker.Palacios, Miguel. Investing in Human Capital. Cambridge University Press, 2004. Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations described the knowledge and skills of workers as a form of human capital. Human capital contracts are characterized by an initial investment amount by the capital provider, followed by a series of periodic dividend payments made from the receiver of the capital to the provider. These payments are variable in amount, proportional with the capital receiver's income, and may never total the initial investment amount made the capital provider. In contrast, a loan is a form of debt, characterized by interest payments based on a fixed principal amount, where the repayment of the principal is a necessary condition of the loan. In the 1970s, Yale University attempted to replace traditional student loans with human capital contracts under its \\"Tuition Postponement Option\\", a program designed by economists Milton Friedman and James Tobin. However, the program was eventually abandoned as a failure.\\"Yale to Erase Alumni Debts In 2 Loan Plans\\", The New York Times, April 13, 1999 Other attempts to use human capital contracts (or student loans with equity-like payoffs) to fund students, have also generally failed because of severe adverse selection problems‚Äîstudents who opt into such programs are generally those who expect to pursue low-income careers, and are least likely to be able to repay their loans. In addition, human capital contracts, like income taxes, can contribute to moral hazard, by discouraging borrowers from maximizing their income and encouraging them instead to focus on non-wage based forms of compensation, such as more enjoyable work, better benefits, or lighter schedules.Michael Simkovic, Risk-Based Student Loans (2012) Recently, a number of companies have begun to attempt to commercially underwrite human capital contracts for the first time, including some that are not focused on funding a student population.http://www.frugaltopia.com/education/a-new-kind-of-student- loan/http://www.cumulusfunding.com/resources/ Anand Reddi and Andreas Thyssen, of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, proposed the use of human capital contracts to fund U.S. medical education in their article in The Huffington Post entitled \\"Healthcare Reform: Solving the Medical Student Debt Crisis Through Human Capital Contracts\\".\\"Healthcare Reform: Solving the Medical Student Debt Crisis Through Human Capital Contracts\\" By Anand Reddi and Andreas Thyssen, The Huffington Post, June 10, 2011 The Reddi-Thyssen plan is being vetted by the American Medical Association. The University of California system is also currently evaluating human capital contracts as a possible solution for providing more affordable, sustainable tuition assistance.http://www.fixuc.org/ There is also a plan to use human capital contracts in global health. In comparing the merits of human capital contracts with loans, proponents have noted that providers of HCCs are better aligned with the financial interests of the receiver of the funds, and the stream of payments required should be relatively more affordable to individuals who experience adverse economic events such as unemployment or other decreases in disposable income.http://lawschooltuitionbubble.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/thoughts-on- human-capital-contracts/ Relative to conventional consumer loan structures, however, the regulatory framework related to human capital contracts is underdeveloped and has thus far prevented widespread proliferation of the product despite considerable academic research.http://chadkdej.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/making-financial-innovation- socially-useful/ However work is underway in the UK to combine the benefits of human capital contracts with the legal framework developed for loans under the Consumer Credit Act. It is estimated that this will improve both borrowing costs and returns by lowering the default rate.https://stepex.io/whitepaper/ See also *Income Share Agreement References Further reading Notable articles on human capital contracts:   Category:Personal finance Category:Education finance ","title":"Human capital contract"},{"id":"34369197","text":"Pipiza carbonaria is a species of hoverfly, from the family Syrphidae, in the order Diptera.

A number of its medieval buildings survive including the abbey church, which has a famous and important Romanesque sculpture around the entrance. History Foundation According to legend, Moissac Abbey was founded by the Frankish king Clovis,\\"St. Pierre Abbey\\", Moissac office du Tourisme in person the day after a victory over the Visigoths, in 506. The legend states that Clovis had made a vow to erect a monastery with 1,000 monks (in memory of a thousand of his warriors who died in battle) if he triumphed over the Visigoths who had ruled the area for the past century as federati of the Roman Empire. He threw his javelin from the top of the hill to mark the spot where \\"abbey of a thousand monks\\" was to be built. Unfortunately the javelin landed in the middle of a swamp. Historical records however indicate that it was founded by Saint Didier, bishop of Cahors, in the middle of the 7th century. The establishment of the monastery was difficult because of raids by Moors from the south and west and the Norsemen from the north. The abbey was sacked by the Arabs of al-Andalus twice around 732 and was looted in the 9th century by Norman pirates and in the 10th century by Hungarians. 11th century Consecration stone of the cloister The 11th century was a dramatic time for the abbey. In 1030 the roof collapsed from lack of maintenance, and in 1042 there was a serious fire. Durand de Bredons, bishop of Toulouse, appointed the abbot of Cluny Odilon de Merc≈ìur to bring in a sweeping reform to counter the laxity of the monks in 1047.l'abb√© Aymeric de Payrac dans sa chronique √©crite (~1400), Paris Biblioth√®que Nationale, ms. latin 4991-A, f.154 R, col. 1 A new church building was added in 1063 along with significant restoration works. Pope Urban II visited in 1097 and consecrated the high altar and issued a Papal Bull dated 7 May 1097 restoring 40 churches to the abbey;E.Rupin, L'abbaye et les cloitres de Moissac, Picard, Paris, 1897, pp. 62‚Äì64 he also ordered the construction of the cloister, completed in 1100.V.Mortet, Recueil de textes relatifs √† l'histoire de l'architecture en France au Moyen √Çge, XIe- XIIe si√®cle, Picard, Paris, 1911, pp. 146‚Äì148 12th century The 11th and 12th centuries were the first golden age, as Moissac was affiliated to the abbey of Cluny and accepted the Cluniac Reforms, under the guidance of Durand de Bredons, both the abbot of Moissac and the bishop of Toulouse. Papal support, its location on the pilgrim road, the restoration of the buildings and the reforms of de Bredon made the abbey one of the most powerful in France. In the 12th century the abbot of Moissac was second in seniority within the Cluniac hierarchy only to the abbot of Cluny himself.Mill√©naire de Cluny (M√¢con, 1910), vol II, pp. 30‚Äì31Pignot, Histoire de l'ordre de Cluny, vol II, p. 190 During this era the abbey was led by major abbots Dom Hunaud de Gavarret and Dom Ansquitil, who had the doorway and tympanum built. In the 13th century, Raymond de Montpezat, followed by Bertrand de Montaigut, abbots and builders, ruled the abbey. Aymeric de Peyrac, writing his Chronicle in the 15th century in the ch√¢teau of Saint-Nicolas-de-la-Grave, describes these times. Illuminated manuscripts produced in the monastery's scriptorium were taken to Paris by Jean-Baptiste Colbert in the 17th century and are now in the Biblioth√®que Nationale.L√©opold Delisle, Le cabinet des manuscrits, I, pp. 457‚Äì459 15th century The 15th century ushered in a new golden age under the rule of abbots Pierre and Antoine de Caraman, whose building programme included in particular the Gothic part of the abbey church. The 1626 secularization of the abbey caused the Benedictine monks to leave the cloister, which had been a centre of Benedictine life for nearly 1,000 years. They were replaced by Augustinian canons, under commendatory abbots including well-known cardinals such as Mazarin and de Brienne. French Revolution In 1793, the French Revolution put an end to monastic life in Moissac. The abbey church of St Pierre is relatively intact and is still an active church, but the outlying buildings have suffered considerably. In the middle of the 19th century, the laying of a railway track threatened the cloister but it was saved (though the refectory was demolished to facilitate the railway cutting) and listed as a historic monument. Since 1998 the church and cloisters have had international protection as part of a World Heritage Site, \\"Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France\\".Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France Architecture Architectural features of interest include the church's south-west portico, a crenellated structure with sculpture that is a major masterpiece of Romanesque art. This reflected an expansion of image carving both in scope and size, and extended the use of sculpture from the sanctuary to the public exterior.Hearn, M.F., Romanesque Sculpture, Cornell University Press, 1985 The tympanum depicts the Apocalypse of the Book of Revelation. Supporting the tympanum, a trumeau features a statue of the Prophet Isaiah, an outstanding example of Romanesque sculpture, comparable to the work at Santo Domingo de Silos. The cloisters also feature Romanesque sculpture.

Berlin was the chairman and chief executive officer of Berlin Packaging, a global supplier of plastic, glass and metal containers and closures with 2017 sales in excess of $1.3 billion and a valuation of $2.6 billion. In October 2014, the company was valued at $1.4 billion. His management of Berlin Packaging has been used as a case study in The Human Equation by Jeffrey Pfeffer. He is a partner and shareholder of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball team and chairman and owner of the South Bend Cubs, a Minor League Baseball team affiliated with the Chicago Cubs.  Personal background  Berlin was born in Chicago, Illinois. He attended New Trier High School and graduated from Lake Forest Academy. Berlin earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Syracuse University, followed by a Law degree from Loyola University Chicago School of Law in 1986. At Loyola, Berlin served as managing editor of the Law Review.  Professional background  In 1988, Berlin resigned from his job at Chicago-based law firm Katten Muchin & Zavis and joined his father in a business venture to purchase Alco Packaging, later renamed Berlin Packaging, an international packaging supplier of plastic, glass, metal containers and closures. At the time, the company had $69 million in annual sales. For his significant accomplishments at Berlin Packaging and in the packaging industry, Berlin was a 2015 inductee into the National Association of Container Distributors Hall of Fame. In November 2011, Berlin announced he had reached an agreement to purchase the South Bend Silver Hawks. He signed a 20-year cumulative lease agreement with the city of South Bend for the use of Stanley Coveleski Regional Stadium. The sale was approved by the Midwest League, Minor League and Major League Baseball and the Office of the Commissioner of Major League Baseball in early January 2012. On January 12, 2012, the financial and legal transactions were completed, and Berlin became the sole owner of the South Bend Silver Hawks. In September 2014, the team ended a 17-year affiliation with the Arizona Diamondbacks and signed a four- year player development agreement with the Chicago Cubs. The team changed its name to the South Bend Cubs. The player-development agreement was subsequently extended through the 2020 season. In 2015, the South Bend Cubs won the John H. Johnson President's Award, which is the highest honor a franchise can receive in Minor League Baseball. Ballpark Digest named the South Bend Cubs its Team of the Year in 2015. Each season under Berlin's ownership has seen a new attendance record set. Berlin is a significant investor in the Chicago Cubs. Berlin has served on boards of directors, including Hawk Corporation, Channel Products, and Image Skincare.  Philanthropy & Community  Berlin serves on the board of trustees at Syracuse University. He serves on the advisory board of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. In 2017, Berlin was appointed by Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner to the Illinois State Police Merit Board, which is responsible for selecting, promoting, and disciplining Illinois State Police troopers. In 2010, Berlin helped finance the ongoing teaching and research of issues relating to national security at the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism (INSCT) at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. The endowment gift was made by the Andrew Berlin Family National Security Research Fund. Berlin is one of three commissioners on the Glencoe, Illinois, Public Safety Commission, a body which recruits, promotes, and disciplines, along with the director of public safety, all of Glencoe's police, fire and EMT professionals. Berlin started the Glencoe School Safety Project with the goal to add school resource officers to enhance safety at Glencoe, Illinois, schools. The Glencoe School Board also created a Safety and Security Committee at Berlin's request. Berlin was involved in raising money for the Illinois State Police Memorial. As part of this, he funded a film to honor Illinois state troopers who died in the line of duty since 1922. The film won a 2015 Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Public Affairs/Current Affairs Programming.

The court determined that the granting of an order of specific performance is entirely a matter of the discretion of the court. Apart from the rule that such discretion is to be exercised judicially upon all the relevant facts, no rules should be prescribed to regulate that discretion, as such rules would inevitably curtail the court's discretion and negate or erode the plaintiff's right to select his remedy. The English rules regulating courts' discretion to order specific performance are predicated upon that remedy's availability by way of equitable relief only; they are inappropriate to South African law. The Appellate Division held, therefore, that the indiscrimate following of English cases in this regard is to be decried. The decision of the Cape Provincial Division, in SA Mutual Life Assurance Society v Benson (granting an order of specific performance in an action for delivery of shares freely obtainable on the Stock Exchange) was by this reasoning confirmed.

He won the All-Around Cowboy world championship in 1983 and claimed seven individual discipline championships, including six tie-down roping titles. Cooper won the PRCA's Rookie of the Year award in 1976, and was nicknamed \\"Super Looper\\" for his roping ability. The ProRodeo Hall of Fame inducted Cooper in its Tie-Down Roping category in 1979. Early life Cooper was born in Hobbs, New Mexico, and raised on a ranch. He suffered from asthma in his youth, and hair from horses caused him allergies. However, he began to practice roping when he was three to five years old, depending on the source. Cooper stopped being affected by asthma prior to attending high school, and he competed in American Junior Rodeo Association events, winning an award as \\"outstanding individual in 25 years\\" in 1977. Two years earlier, he had won the calf roping title of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association; his father, Tuffy, won the organization's title in the discipline in 1950. He went to Southeastern Oklahoma State University and was a journalism major. Rodeo career In his rookie PRCA season, 1976, Cooper won the organization's tie-down roping championship and led the event in average earnings at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR). He broke the record for the most prize money won by a rookie cowboy, and earned the PRCA's Rookie of the Year award. In 1977, Cooper was the third-leading earner at the NFR's roping event. At the 1978 Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo, he led all cowboys in prize money won, and his calf-roping winnings were the largest recorded in any non-NFR event at the time. After breaking one of his wrists the previous year, Cooper won his second calf roping season championship in 1980, and had a third-place NFR average earnings finish in the discipline. The following year, he earned his second straight season calf roping title. However, he narrowly lost out on the PRCA's All-Around Cowboy season championship to his cousin, Jimmie Cooper, who earned $47.60 more in prize money than he did during 1981. Cooper had almost $100,000 in earnings in 1981, and was approaching $400,000 in career earnings in 1982. He won his third consecutive PRCA tie-down roping championship, and fourth overall, in 1982, rallying from a prize money deficit of nearly $15,000 at the season-ending NFR. A second-place finish in that event's tie-down roping competition was enough for him to pass Jerry Jetton, the previous leader. Cooper's total earnings for the year neared $100,000 again, and in the season-long All-Around Cowboy competition he placed fourth. In 1983, Cooper won the All-Around Cowboy championship, National Finals Steer Roping (NFSR) title, and calf roping championship. This made him the first PRCA competitor since 1958 to win three discipline season championships, and the fourth in PRCA history. Cooper broke the record for yearly prize winnings with $153,390.84 in earnings, and claimed all-around and tie-down roping average earnings titles at the NFR. In calf roping, he set a season record in earnings with $122,455 for the year. After holding the lead in the All-Around Cowboy standings late in the NFR, Cooper ended up in second place for the year, behind Dee Pickett. He did manage to win his fifth straight calf roping season championship. In steer roping, Cooper was unable to defend his 1983 championship title; he was in seventh place before a win in the discipline at the NFSR caused him to move up to fourth for the year. In 1985, Cooper wound up second in calf roping for the season, though he was the discipline's champion in the Winston Tour series. He won the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo's all-around title in 1989, and by September 1990 was the PRCA's all-time leading money winner with career earnings of more than $1.1 million. Cooper was in sixth place in the 1990 PRCA NFSR standings, before breaking his left wrist and suffering a concussion in an automobile accident. Cooper eventually returned to competition, but had another injury setback in 1993, when he pulled a groin and missed three months of rodeos. Later that year, he won all-around and steer roping championships at Cheyenne Frontier Days. In 1994, he was out of action for much of the year after rotator cuff surgeries. He claimed a calf roping title at the 1995 San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo. Later in the year he had the fastest average calf roping time at the NFR, which was later described as Cooper's \\"favorite moment\\" at the event. Cooper finished second in the All-Around Cowboy standings in 1996. That year, he led the NFSR in average earnings in steer roping; Cooper became the first cowboy to win four NFR average steer roping titles, a record that has since been surpassed by Guy Allen. It was the eighth NFR average title of his career and his ninth overall NFR championship, counting his 1983 all-around victory. As of 2016, he was second among cowboys in NFR titles, behind Trevor Brazile, and first with all-around championships excluded. At a 2000 rodeo in Lovington, New Mexico, he surpassed $2 million in earnings; Cooper was the first to reach this mark in rodeo. As of 2011, Cooper remained a part-time competitor in rodeo events. By 2016, he had retired. Family Several members of Cooper's family have competed in rodeo events. His father Tuffy was a PRCA cowboy who was inducted into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in 1998; he taught roping to Roy when he was a child. Cooper's sister, Betty Gayle, was a champion in cowgirl events and is in the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame. He also had a brother, Clay, who was a professional rodeo cowboy, as was his cousin Jimmie. Cooper has three sons‚ÄîClif, Clint, and Tuf‚Äîwho are cowboys. They all participated in the 2010 NFR's tie-down roping event, making it the first time three brothers had done so. Tuf was the winner of the 2017 PRCA All-Around Cowboy title. Cooper's stepdaughter, Shada, is married to Brazile, a 23-time PRCA world champion. Legacy Inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1979, Cooper was part of the Hall's inaugural class of enshrinees in the category of Tie-Down Roping. For his skills in calf roping, he acquired the nickname of \\"Super Looper\\".

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82314 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Thatcher in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Scheina, p 72 Point Thatcher was unique because it was the only cutter that was built in the class that was powered using gas turbine main drive engines. Construction and design details Point Thatcher was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two gas turbine engines and had two variable-pitch propellers. This was the only Point class cutter equipped in this manner and the Thatcher was used by the Coast Guard to evaluate gas turbine propulsion. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. The design specifications for Point Thatcher included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 History After commissioning Point Thatcher was stationed at Miami, Florida where she was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. She was moved to Norfolk, Virginia in 1964. On 16 June 1965, she stood by the Norwegian MV Blue Master and the following a collision off Cape Henry. On 24 July she escorted FV Explorer with casualties on board to Little Creek, Virginia. From early 1966 to early 1971 she was once again homeported at Miami. On 19 February 1966 she transported 16 Cuban refugees from Gun Cay, Bahamas to Miami. On 4 October while responding to the grounding of MV Transporter off Miami Beach, she was herself grounded and holed. The crew was forced to abandon ship. After being refloated on 9 October, she was towed to Miami Beach for repair and refit. On 28 March 1967, she embarked seven Cuban stowaways from MV Amfialia and delivered them to Key West, Florida. On 31 May 1970 the refueled and escorted a distressed 18 foot pleasure craft to Miami. Her homeport was shifted to Sarasota, Florida in March 1971. On 28 December 1977 she seized the MV Marania for carrying contraband. In 1985 Point Thatcher was moved to Nokomis, Florida. On 7 May 1985 she rescued three persons from a raft in the Gulf of Mexico. On 2-3 March 1987 she towed the disabled FV Beach King from a point 225 miles south of Mobile, Alabama to safety at St. Petersburg, Florida during a storm. Later the same week on 7-8 March, she towed the disabled FV Miss Ann and the pleasure craft Grenada II to Fort Myers, Florida in 18 foot seas. When was transferred to the Pacific coast in July 1990, Point Thatcher joined her sister cutter in August at Gulfport, Mississippi where their primary mission was law enforcement and Point Thatcher set a record during that time for 14 drug arrests in coastal waters. Point Thatcher was decommissioned 13 March 1992 and moved to USCG Training Center Cape May, New Jersey for use as a training hulk. In the spring of 2000 she was sunk as an artificial reef off Ocean City, Maryland.

The garden is open to the public between April and September on Friday 2‚Äì4 p.m.Nelson Garden visitors leaflet History The walled garden was the site of a real tennis court in the 17th century and a bowling green by 1718. It then became an orchard; an example of an 18th-century hypocaust (heated) wall still survives, where fruit trees would have been 'espaliered' (trained flat) against the warm brickwork. There are traces of the stoking chamber for this wall in a neighbouring garden. Roman and Norman remains lie deep beneath the lawn.Monmouth Civic Society, Guide to the Monmouth Heritage Blue Plaque Trail, n.d., p.25 The Nelson Garden commemorates Lord Nelson's visit to Monmouth on August 19, 1802, with Sir William and Lady Emma Hamilton on the occasion of their tour of the Wye Valley.

American Association of University Professors, 1 June 2014. Web. 7 July 2015. The center was founded in 2006 by Professor Stewart M. Hoover, a Journalism and Mass Communication faculty known for his work on popular media and religions. In addition to hosting several international conferences that address current issues in media, religion and culture, the center offers fellowship programs for domestic and international scholars interested in conducting research on related subjects. The Center takes on various projects with research fellows to explore religion and media from varied angles and through new, developing theoretical frameworks. The Center aims to bring together scholars, professionals and the larger public to explore the variety of ways media and religion influence one another and our daily lives. The Center currently works on several projects including one on the \\"Third Spaces\\" of Religion and Media, as well as a project in conjunction with the University of Haifa, in Israel on Media Ambivalence. The Center also produces a radio showConran, M. (2014, December 3). Sacred Lines: Journalism, Public Scholarship, and Academia. Retrieved July 8, 2015 and has a group research blog.  History  The idea to establish a center for media, religion and culture was introduced by Paul S. Voakes in 2003 when the dean saw Hoover‚Äôs success in attracting support from the Lilly Endowment, Inc to conduct research on media and religion. What started as a research collaboration between Hoover, his graduate students and his colleagues in Europe began to develop into something bigger. In November 2004 Hoover with the assistance of Lynn Schofield Clark wrote a proposal for the establishment of the center. They identified project areas that later became the center's foci. Research works remained to be the foundational activity for the center. In addition, the center seeks support for Senior, Faculty and Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program that help shape ongoing research and scholarly projects in the field of media, religion and culture. The center also hold lectures, seminars and formal conferences both independently and in cooperation with other institutions such as New York University and the University of Southern California in an effort to bridge the academy with religious communities, industries and the wider public. Furthermore, it acts as the global secretariat for the International Conferences on Media, Religion and Culture that started in Uppsala, Sweden, in 1994 and it has become the prominent conference in the field. The Center was officially inaugurated in 2006. During the same year, Clark left University of Colorado at Boulder and subsequently the Center to become Assistant Professor at the School of Communication at University of Denver. She remains a close collaborator of the Center and maintains a good relationship with Hoover. In 2007 Journalism and Mass Communication hired a new Assistant Professor, Nabil Echchaibi, who specializes in identity politics among young Muslim in the Arab world and in diaspora. He is now the associate director of the Center.  Activities   Research Projects  Some of the projects mentioned below took place prior to the establishment of the Center, but closely associated with its development and continuation. Finding Religion in the Media, 2010 - Present The Center for Media, Religion and Culture is currently undertaking a study funded by the Ford Foundation on the ways religion is represented, experienced, and understood through the media today. The project, entitled ‚ÄúFinding Religion in the Media,‚Äù explores the extent to which religious belief, practice, and action‚Äîparticularly that directed at social reform and social change‚Äîcan be generated in and through the media sphere. The ‚Äúthird spaces‚Äù concept has been central to the Finding Religion in the Media project. As developed by Hoover and Echchaibi, this concept serves as an interpretive tool to highlight what we call a ‚Äúthickening‚Äù of the religious experience beyond dichotomous definitions of both religion and media categories. Digital spaces have opened up opportunities to theorize the production of meaning across hybrid spaces. Digital media reflect and narrativize life experiences and the Center has done so by looking specifically at case studies of the way religion and the religious is articulated and contested online. The research is framed around the novelty of technologies that leads us to adopt a hierarchical indexing of what constitutes an authentic experience of belonging and belief, outside of dichotomies of traditional/modern, physical/digital, and real/proximal embodied experience. The impulse to define how and why we communicate, drawing boundaries between various technological media leads to problematic understandings of complex user identities. The third spaces concept argues that theories of ritual, religion, media and communication benefit from an analysis of how meaning is produced and performed at the borderlines of a complex ecosystem of media ensembles and hybrid spaces.Hoover, Stewart, and Nabil Echchaibi. \\"The\\" Third Spaces\\" of Digital Religion.\\" The Center for Media, Religion, and Culture. Boulder (2012). Print. Muslims in the Mountain West, 2009-2010 This research, supported by a grant from the Social Sciences Research Council, is a joint project of the Center and the University of Colorado‚Äôs Center for Asian Studies. It is intended to develop a profile of Muslims and of Islam in the six states of the mountain west. Interviews and site visits will document the life, interests and culture of this growing community. The outcome will be information useful to media, scholars, and interested members of the public, and products including a website, a documentary film, and various resources and materials. The grant also supports a series of round table conversations and informational events bringing together scholars of Islam, members of the media, and representatives of the Muslim community. The project also fed into the Center‚Äôs conference on Islam and the Media. Symbolism, Media, and the Lifecourse, 1996-2001 Principal Investigator (P.I.): Stewart Hoover; Associate P.I: Lynn Schofield Clark; Research Associates: Diane F. Alters, Joseph G. Champ, Lee Hood, and Henrik Boes. The project resulted in the book Media, Home, and Family (Routledge, 2004) written in collaboration by Hoover, Clark and Alters. The book argued that how families discuss the rules and practices surrounding media use are an important part of how they lay claim to a family identity in the age of reflexive parenting. The Symbolism project also provided the initial research for Hoover's, Religion in the Media Age (Routledge, 2006), Clark's From Angels to Aliens: Teenagers, the Media, and the Supernatural (Oxford U Press, 2003), and supported the development of the edited volume Practicing Religion in the Age of the Media, edited by Hoover and Clark (Columbia U Press, 2002).

The church is a late Georgian Roman Catholic church with later Victorian additions by the Catholic convert architect Benjamin Bucknall.John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , p.398 It has been designated as a Grade II listed building since 15 August 1974,Church of St. Mary R C, Monmouth, Listed Buildings, accessed January 2012 and is one of 24 buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. History and architecture After the sixteenth century, Monmouth was a centre for recusancy.Keith Kissack, Nonconformity in Monmouth, Capel: The Chapels Heritage Society Newsletter, no.29, 1997 The town had, in 1773, one of the highest proportions of Catholics in England and Wales. The Penal Laws against Catholics were relaxed in 1778, through the Papists Act, and Monmouth magistrates were petitioned to erect a \\"Public Catholick Chapel in the Town\\". One of the petitioners, Michael Watkins, was then the landlord of the Robin Hood Inn in Monnow Street, where Mass had been celebrated hitherto in an upper room.Keith Kissack, Monmouth and its Buildings, Logaston Press, 2003, , p.79Monmouth Civic Society, Monmouth Heritage Blue Plaque Trail, n.d., p.18 Lobbying resulted in permission being given for this church three years before a similar church in Chepstow. However, because of a local by-law aimed at making Nonconformist and Catholic buildings as inconspicuous as possible, it had to concede that the building should not look like a church. The entrance was not allowed to open on to the highway and Catholic worshippers were required to arrive at the chapel one at a time. The church was originally set back discreetly from the road, concealed by a row of cottages. The cottages were demolished in Bucknall's rebuilding, after discrimination against Catholics had been eased. The original building forms the area of the present sanctuary and sacristy, and the stained glass window to the left of the sanctuary is Georgian Gothic in style. The earliest part of the church is the east end, of 1793. In 1829 came Catholic Emancipation, and the chapel was extended in 1837 with the completion of the chancel, half the length of the present nave. This was followed in 1871 by an extensive rebuilding by Benjamin Bucknall. This included the demolition of the cottages fronting the church and the erection of the tower and an elaborate frontage in Old Red Sandstone. Newman describes the \\"double bellcote crowned by a precipitously steep slate roof.\\" Internally, the font depicts the serpent of Eden entwined around the stem.St Mary's Catholic Church, Monmouth: A Short History 1793‚Äì2009.

John Cashman, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 31 Jan 2012 Internal features The church includes many features, but of especial note is its association with Saint John Kemble, who was a missionary in Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. He was martyred for his faith at Hereford on 22 August 1679 and lies buried at nearby Welsh Newton. The Marches were an area where the old faith continued long after the Reformation, and many of the local big houses gave sanctuary to Catholic services conducted clandestinely by priests who could suffer extreme penalties if they were discovered. The parish of St Mary's organises a pilgrimage to St John Kemble's tomb on the Sunday nearest to the date of his martyrdom. The church also includes an altar dedicated to the saint's memory, which was used for the celebration of Mass during penal times at Pembridge Castle: this consists of two benches that could be separated to disguise its purpose. St Mary's Catholic Church, Monmouth: St John Kemble. Retrieved 16 January 2012 These historic buildings were refurbished in 2009/2010. The church possesses a fourteenth-century processional cross; an embroidered red chasuble dating from about 1502; and a hinged cross, possibly of Spanish origin, dating from the seventeenth century.

Inspired by various video games released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, the game features Abobo, a boss character from the Double Dragon franchise, traveling through the worlds of several different games to save his son. Developed by I-Mockery founder Roger Barr, Abobo's Big Adventure was released in January 2012 to positive critical reception. Gameplay and Plot The player's objective in Abobo's Big Adventure is to proceed through different levels of the game using the character Abobo from Double Dragon. The game itself is split into different sub-games that follow one another, each an homage to a particular game: \\"Double Drabobo\\", \\"Super Mabobo\\", \\"Urban Chabobo\\", \\"Zeld Abobo\\", \\"Balloon Abobo\\", \\"Pro Wrabobo\\", \\"Mega Mabobo\\", \\"Contra Bobo\\", and \\"Punch Abobo\\". Each game makes use of the directional keys to control the movement of the character, while the 'A' and 'S' keys perform functions related to the particular sub-game, such as punching and kicking respectively. Abobo has a rage meter that increases when he hits enemies and decreases when he is hit; when the meter is completely filled, the player can press 'A' and 'S' together to perform a special attack that destroys or greatly damages all enemies on the screen. With the exception of the \\"Contra Bobo\\" level, each level is single player only. The game's plot revolves around Abobo's son, Aboboy, who is kidnapped in the opening cutscene in a nod to the opening of Double Dragon. The game's levels are mostly linear, featuring several references to other Nintendo Entertainment System properties with their enemies and layout. Before the final level, Abobo encounters Jerome \\"Doc\\" Louis from the Punch-Out!! series. Doc reveals that the real villain is his former pupil, Little Mac, who went mad with power after winning the championship. Abobo defeats Little Mac in a boxing match, decapitates him with the Power Glove, and rescues Aboboy. As the crowd cheers for the reunited pair, they suddenly leap out of the ring and begin to graphically murder everyone within reach. The events of the game are finally revealed as a dream Abobo is having, a reference to the ending of Super Mario Bros. 2. Development mouse. Development on the game was started in 2002 by I-Mockery founder Roger Barr, who intended it to be his first full-length flash-based game and to feature his favorite NES character, Abobo. Working with a programmer nicknamed \\"Bane\\", they put together several early levels. However the game was delayed by various side projects, including a game with a similar concept named \\"Domo-Kun's Angry Smashfest\\". He later returned to the game with the help of developers Nick Pasto of PestoForce and \\"Pox\\" of The Pox Box, and after mapping out the storyline decided to start the project over from scratch in 2006 due to dissatisfaction with the early work, and the feel that the original programming strayed too far from the feel of an actual NES. Level development was done by playing NES titles and taking notes on which characters they wished to include and where. Rather than have each level feature just one group of enemies from the same game, they would instead act as a tribute to the system as a whole and feature a variety of them. During the course of development, smaller projects were also done in order to keep themselves motivated and meet financial obligations. By 2009, the first three levels of the game were completed and revealed at the San Diego Comic- Con, playable with a NES controller as originally intended. With the game well-received, they resumed work, using feedback from the test to fix bugs and issues, and in 2010 presented the game at the following Comic-con in a free- to-play arcade cabinet, with artwork made by Jeff Bandelin of Newgrounds. Though the game was delayed heavily in 2011, they intended to release it at the end of December. In September of that year, Barr took the game with him on a comedy tour he was invited to attend with Keith Apicary, showcasing it at various arcades and game shops. An official trailer followed shortly after, and in response to numerous donations they had received, they began work on a smaller game called \\"Aboboy's Small Adventure\\" for anyone who donated, though it pushed the release date for the completed project further. On January 11, 2012 the game was released on Newgrounds.com, with an added tutorial explaining how to play the game with a NES controller. A downloadable version of the game has also been released,http://abobosbigadventure.com/fullgame.php while the team plans to continue to showcase the arcade cabinet at various conventions. Reception The game was positively received at its release. On July 12, 2013, it was announced that Abobo's Big Adventure had won the Newgrounds 2012 \\"Game of the Year\\" award. GameSpy praised their work, calling it the \\"mother of all 8-bit homage flash videogames\\" Mexican magazine Cine Premiere called it fun, and a good way to re-live the nostalgia of 8- and 16-bit video games. GameZone described it as \\"part parody and part tribute\\" to the NES, further calling its story \\"not cheesy. Instead, it's all kinds of badass.\\" Eurogamer.it called it a \\"serious contender for [Game of the Year] 2012\\" and \\"The final tribute to the NES\\", further describing it as both well made and very difficult. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Adam Smith stated that while the combination of various sprite styles could be reminiscent of various webcomics, the game was created with the original influences in mind, not just the characters. He further added that it was a \\"well designed series of tiny games that more often than not succeed in capturing the pleasures of the originals\\". Wired called it \\"8-bit parody done right\\", further praising it for deviating from similar titles by offering more than simplified graphics and sounds, and that \\"the fearlessness with which it mocks these age-old heroes portrays an almost tangible love for them at the same time\\". 1UP.com editors Jeremy Parish and Bob Mackey both praised the game as well, with Parish questioning whether it blurred the line between \\"parody and appropriation [...] you could make a case for it being a Dada-ist expression\\", while Mackey asserted he still felt it was parody, but that the controls for each aspect of the game had been replicated \\"dead on.\\" GameSpot praised the game saying \\"It's a labor of love that's jam-packed with a staggering number of pitch-perfect references to NES games. It doesn't just duplicate the sprites, environments, and music of so many NES games; it also captures the simple but challenging gameplay of the games it imitates.\\" Yoshihisa Kishimoto, creator of Double Dragon, has stated in a Polygon interview that he was supportive and loved the game.

He most recently worked at the Sloan- Kettering Institute in New York studying DNA replication in eukaryotes and its control.The Discovery and Isolation of RNA Polymerase by Jerard Hurwitz Education Hurwitz attended Indiana University, earning a B.A. in Chemistry in 1949. He received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry in 1953 from Case Western Reserve University. Career Hurwitz joined the microbiology department at Washington University in 1956 and began investigating the incorporation of ribonucleotides into RNA. Two years later, he moved back to New York and became an Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the New York University (NYU) School of Medicine, where he continued to study RNA synthesis. In 1955, Marianne Grunberg-Manago and Severo Ochoa had reported the isolation of an enzyme that catalyzed the synthesis of RNA. This enzyme was at first hoped to be responsible for the synthesis of RNA in cells, and Ochoa's discovery was honored with a Nobel prize in 1959. However, it was later realized that Ochoa's enzyme did not use DNA to synthesize RNA but instead formed arbitrary sequences, and later this enzyme was found to degrade RNA in cells. Undeterred by Ochoa's findings, Hurwitz searched for a cellular RNA polymerase on his own and in 1960 he reported the isolation of RNA polymerase activity from Escherichia coli extracts. Remarkably, several other research groups reported similar discoveries at roughly the same time (Samuel B. Weiss, Audrey Stevens, and James Bonner). Hurwitz continued his research on RNA synthesis, and in 1962 Hurwitz, John J. Furth, and Monika Anders reported the purification of RNA polymerase. Hurwitz along with PhD student Sue Wickner and Reed Wickner also worked on how the DNA of single-stranded DNA virus became replicated. They identified the enzymes that converted single-stranded DNA of the Phi X174 virus into the double-stranded replicative form by means of studying which genes were required for the in vitro synthesis of the double-stranded DNA.Harrison Echols.

Awards and honors Hurwitz was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

After Rangers went into administration, √áelik chose to leave the club in March 2012 without a pay-off. He stated that he didn't make the wrong decision in joining the club, but the club entering administration was unpredictable. GAIS claimed that Rangers owed them ¬£240,000 compensation for the transfer of Celik. However, there were suggestions that Celik was not offered a new contract within 60 days before the end of his previous deal, meaning that no compensation would have been necessary. Both GAIS and Celik disputed this and the club have threatened to take the matter to FIFA if Rangers don't pay them.  Return to GAIS  After leaving Rangers in March 2012, √áelik signed an eight-month contract with GAIS. Pescara √áelik continued his career in Italian first league with the newcomer Pescara in 2012. He scored the first goal for Pescara the 2012/2013 season against Sampdoria in a 2‚Äì3 loss. International career √áelik has represented Sweden at youth level. He made his under-21 debut against Norway on 2 June 2011 and scored two goals in a 4‚Äì1 win. He is eligible to play for Turkey through his parents. Personal life √áelik was born and raised in the suburb Biskopsg√•rden, Hisingen, an island which forms part of the Gothenburg Municipality. √áelik's parents are ethnic Kurds from Turkey. His mother and father lived in Konya before moving to Sweden, where his father opened a restaurant.

It is constructed in stone, with a wide, fifteenth-century four-centre doorway and is a rare medieval survival in Monmouth. After the Reformation, the town was a centre for Catholicism and the landlord in the 1770s, Michael Watkins, allowed Mass to be celebrated in an upper room of the pub. The Penal Laws against Catholics were in force until the Papists Act of 1778, and Watkins was amongst those who successfully petitioned Monmouth magistrates to allow a building that would become St Mary's Roman Catholic Church. This public house and the church that Michael Watkins lobbied for are two of the 24 buildings in the Monmouth Heritage Trail. A blue plaque was added to the exterior of the building in 2009, which celebrated the religious history of the building. In 1848, one of the landlord's children accidentally set a curtain on fire by placing a candle too near it. The ensuing fire destroyed the curtain and a few items of clothing before it was contained. In 1882, the landlord, John Richards, was charged with being drunk and disorderly in his own house. He was found guilty and fined 10s and 7s costs.

The Corruption Perception Index, released by Transparency International in 2017, reported that Finland is the third-most-transparent country in the world (after Denmark and New Zealand). According to a Transparency International survey, an overwhelming majority of people in Finland do not witness cases of corruption by public officials or institutions in their lifetime. Existing corruption tends to be structural, arising from a network of wealthy individuals who favor each other in business; private companies have no disclosure requirements. The few instances of corruption involving the government include decision-making in state investments,Report: Finland 'still has work to do' in addressing corruption yle 3.2.2014 political donations, and election funding. Non-traditional types of corruption in Finland (common globally) include tax evasion, gifts, hospitality, and conflicts of interest.

Life and career Rafter was born in Wellington, New Zealand in 1913. Although carbon dating was invented in the United States by the chemist Willard Libby, New Zealand scientists played a significant part in its early development. Rafter is internationally recognized as one of the pioneers of the technique, and his publications form part of the core of radiocarbon literature. Nuclear scientist Rodger Sparks recognizes Athol Rafter‚Äôs contribution to radiocarbon dating in Radiocarbon dating ‚Äì New Zealand beginnings, New Zealand Science Review, 61, 2 (2004) Athol Rafter was one of New Zealand‚Äôs pioneering nuclear scientists, that started his career as part of Ernest Marsden‚Äôs post-war team of nuclear scientists and leading the DSIR‚Äôs Institute of Nuclear Sciences through the 1960s and 1970s. Rafter was educated in Wellington, gaining a Master of Science in chemistry from Victoria University College in 1938. Rafter worked as a schoolteacher until a job as a research scientist became available at the Dominion Laboratory in 1940. Rafter initially concentrated on analysis of coal ash, but gained much acclaim when he worked with rock analyst Fred Seelye on a new method of analysing uranium-bearing minerals found in beach sands on the West Coast of New Zealand. In 1948, following the establishment of a nuclear sciences team at the DSIR, Rafter was sent to the United States to train in radiochemistry and to visit nuclear establishments in the United States, Canada and England. On Rafter's return, he began to work with the new technique of radiocarbon dating, which dates organic material by comparing the ratio of radiocarbon atoms (carbon-14) to regular carbon atoms (carbon-12) with established radiocarbon: carbon ratios from the past. Rafter first used the method to date moa bones and ash showers from volcanos on the North Island of New Zealand. After difficulties with the process published by Willard Libby, radiocarbon dating‚Äôs American pioneer, Rafter worked with DSIR physicist Gordon Fergusson and their team to perfect a new and reliable method of radiocarbon dating using carbon dioxide gas rather than solid carbon. In the 1958 Queen's Birthday Honours, Rafter was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, in recognition of his service as director of the Dominion Physical Laboratory. In 1959, Rafter was appointed the inaugural director of the DSIR‚Äôs Institute of Nuclear Sciences, in Gracefield, New Zealand. In his new position, Rafter encouraged research into natural variations in radiocarbon levels, in the process discovering a link between atmospheric nuclear weapons tests and rising levels of radiocarbon in the atmosphere, a phenomenon he and Fergusson called the ‚ÄòAtom Bomb Effect‚Äô when they published their results in 1957. Rafter also encouraged the use of naturally occurring stable (non-radioactive) isotopes for geological research, developing techniques for use in geothermal and environmental studies. After retiring from the DSIR, Rafter spent two years as director of the United Nations Environment Programme Monitoring and Assessment Research Centre in London. In 1993, the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences marked Rafter‚Äôs 80th birthday by naming their radiocarbon dating facility the Rafter Radiocarbon Laboratory.

The act, in its second part, also enabled the people of New Mexico Territory and of Arizona Territory to form a constitution and State government and be admitted into the Union, requiring a referendum to determine if both territories should be admitted as a single state.Everett, Dianna. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\"Enabling Act (1906).\\" Retrieved January 10, 2012. Background The Oklahoma Organic Act of 1890 contemplated admitting Oklahoma and Indian Territories as a single state. However, residents of Indian Territory sponsored a bill to admit Indian Territory as the State of Sequoyah, which was defeated in the U. S. Congress in 1905. President Theodore Roosevelt then proposed a compromise that would join Indian Territory with Oklahoma Territory to form a single state. This resulted in passage of the Oklahoma Enabling Act, which President Roosevelt signed June 16, 1906. Requirements for the Oklahoma Constitution The Act included several other requirements for the Oklahoma Constitution: * Citizens of the US or members of tribes who have been resident in the territories for at least six months may participate in the constitutional convention and vote in the referendum.Enabling Act Sec 2 * The capital shall temporarily be in Guthrie, Oklahoma until 1913, when a referendum shall determine a permanent capital. * Provisions shall be made for a public school system, free from sectarian control and with classes conducted in English (provided that foreign languages may be taught). ** Section 16 and 36 of surplus lands be reserved for the benefit of common schoolsEnabling Act Sec 7 ** Section 13 of surplus lands be reserved for the benefit of higher education, reserving 1/3 for the University of Oklahoma, 1/3 for the Agricultural and Mechanical College and Colored Agricultural Normal School, and 1/3 for Normal SchoolsEnabling Act Sec 8 * That said State shall never enact any law restricting or Right of suffrage or abridging the right of suffrage on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude * the Osage Indian Reservation be organized as a separate county in the new stateEnabling Act Sec 21 * Preservation of freedom of religion * Prohibition of polygamy and plural marriage * Prohibition of the manufacture, sale, barter or gift of liquor for 21 years after statehood * \\"nothing contained in the said constitution shall be construed to limit or impair the rights of person or property pertaining to the Indians of said Territories (so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished) or to limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this act had never been passed.\\"Enabling Act, Preamble President Roosevelt proclaimed Oklahoma a state on November 16, 1907. Equal footing doctrine The requirement to keep Guthrie as the State's temporary capital was challenged in court after Oklahoma City, Oklahoma won the election and the capital was moved prematurely. Coyle v. Smith was the US Supreme Court Case that helped define the equal footing doctrine. On December 29, 1910, the state of Oklahoma enacted a statute which removed the state capital from Guthrie to Oklahoma City. W.H. Coyle, owner of large property interests in Guthrie, sued the state of Oklahoma, arguing that the move was performed in violation of the state constitution's acceptance of the terms of Congress's enabling act. The power given to Congress by Art. IV, ¬ß 3, of the Constitution is to admit new States to this Union, and relates only to such States as are equal to each other in power and dignity and competency to exert the residuum of sovereignty not delegated to the Federal Government. The Supreme Court held that preventing the state of Oklahoma the right to locate its own seat of government deprived it of powers which all other states of the Union enjoyed, and thus violated the traditional constitutional principle that all new states be admitted \\"on an equal footing with the original states\\". As a result, the provision of the enabling act which temporarily restricted Oklahoma's right to determine where its seat of government would be was unconstitutional. Enablement of Arizona and New Mexico statehood The second part of the act provided for the enablement of the peoples of Arizona and New Mexico to form a state constitution and government in anticipation of admission to the union as a single state. However, the combined state was not admitted under these provisions; instead a separate act, the State Enablement Act of 1910, was enacted and was the statutory vehicle that led to their admissions as individual states. Failure to disestablish reservations A pair of U.S. Supreme Court cases first originating around 2015 challenged part of the Oklahoma Enabling Act by asserting that the Act failed to actually disestablish the reservation lands for the purposes of determining whether a crime committed on those lands was of the state's jurisdiction (if they had been disestablished) or federal (if they remained reservations), under the Major Crimes Act. In July 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress did in fact fail to disestablish the reservations in the Enabling Act, and thus for purposes of the Major Crimes Act, those lands that were former reservations should be considered \\"Indian country\\" and are overseen by federal jurisdiction.

According to the Anales de la Catedral de Manila, the crew of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi discovered a group of natives in what is now Ermita along the eastern shores of Manila Bay worshiping a statue of a female figure. There are a number of theories as to its origin, it could either be an Animist-Tantrist Diwata which is a localization of the Hindu \\"Devata\\" (‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§§‡§æ), an East Asian idol due to her Chinese features, a Marian icon imported from nearby Portuguese Macau, or, due to its striking resemblance to the Santo Nino de Cebu, may be a relic left by the Magellan expedition when it passed by the Philippines during the first circumnavigation of the world. This sacred statue had managed to survive Islamic Iconoclasm by the Sultanate of Brunei (ŸÜ⁄¨ÿßÿ±ÿß ÿ®ÿ±ŸàŸÜŸä ÿØÿßÿ±ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ), a state that had invaded Manila. While its original purpose is debated, the image was later identified by missionaries as that of the Virgin Mary. Local folklore meanwhile recounts the Spaniards witnessing natives venerating the statue in a \\"pagan manner\\", by placing it on a trunk surrounded by pandan plants. The pandan plant itself is a common food ingredient in the Indianised cultures of South and Southeast Asia. This is remembered in the placement of real or imitation pandan leaves around the image's base as one of its iconic attributes. On 19 May 1571, the local sovereigns Sulayman III and Rajah Matanda ceded Kota Selurong (a client state of the Sultanate of Brunei) as well as the Kingdom of Tondo to the Spanish Empire, with Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, who had arrived from Mexico, consecrating the city to both Saint Pudentiana and Our Lady of Guidance.\\"History\\". Official Website of the Manila Metropolitan Cathedral - Basilica. In 1578, Phillip II of Spain issued a royal decree invoking Our Lady of Guidance to be \\"sworn patroness\\" of Manila. The statue was first enshrined in Manila Cathedral inside the citadel of Intramuros until 1606, when the first shrine compound was built on the current site. Called La Hermita (\\"the Hermitage\\") because of a Mexican hermit who lived in the area, the shrine was originally made of bamboo, nipa, and molave wood. It was later rebuilt in stone but suffered damaged in an earthquake in 1810. In 1897, a novena booklet titled Novena o Pagsisiam sa Nuestra Se√±ora de Guia (\\"Novena to Our Lady of Guidance\\") was published by the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas in Manila. The book recounts the image‚Äôs origin story, where natives found it sitting on a trunk, and built a roof above it and the surrounding pandan plants. The text goes on to condemn them for their polytheism, and mentions murder. The image initially received a feast day on 18 December, but the date was transferred to 19 May when a rainstorm hit Manila Cathedral in February 1771.(1897). \\"Novena o Pagsisyam sa Nuestra Senora de Guia\\", Imprental del Colegio de Santo Tomas, Manila. During the Second World War, the statue was saved by the parish priest of Ermita Church, Fr. Blas de Guernica, and a Justo N. L√≥pez. They hid the statue in a niche of the church's crypt a few weeks before the Allies liberated Manila in February 1945. After the battle, Fr. Rogelio Bedonia, along with a chaplain and four soldiers of the United States Army, went to the completely-ruined shrine, retrieved the icon, and brought it to a safer place. Until the construction of a temporary chapel, the icon stayed in a private house on Taft Avenue, in San Miguel de Mayumo and finally in Quiapo. The current shrine was built in 1947.DeAnda (2009-11-22). \\"In Honor of Nuestra Se√±ora de Guia\\". With one's past... A replica of the image was made to commemorate the quadricentennial of the icon's finding. From May 1970 to 1971, the replica visited almost all parishes, chapels, hospitals, schools, and other institutions in the Archdiocese of Manila. It is this replica that is brought out for processions and public veneration on its feast day, with the original remaining ensconced in its glass-covered alcove above the main altar. The statue was removed from the shrine and placed in the room of Pope John Paul II for the duration of his 1995 Apostolic visit. In December 2011, EWTN featured the statue as the \\"oldest Marian Icon in the Philippines\\" in the program, \\"Mary: Mother of the Philippines\\". Father Patrick Peyton also once preached a sermon on the Family Rosary Crusade in the presence of the image. Papal associations The image was canonically crowned on Rizal Day, 30 December 1955, by the Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines, Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi. The statue was removed from the shrine and placed in the room of Pope John Paul II for the duration of his visit in early January 1995 for World Youth Day. On 14 January 2015, the image was again removed from Ermita Church and translated to the Apostolic Nunciature along Taft Avenue, where Pope Francis stayed during his visit to the Philippines and Sri Lanka. The icon was later present at Quirino Grandstand for the Pope's open-air Mass on 18 January. It accompanied a replica of the Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫, another widely venerated, early Spanish colonial icon whose feast was celebrated on that day.

Background and family Ramsden was the oldest child of English born Martinborough storekeeper and farmer Henry Oakes Ramsden and Sophia Jane Harris. He attended Martinborough primary school, but suffered from asthma and tuberculosis which made his attendance erratic. He also managed to get mentioned in the local paper when a lemonade bottle he was opening broke causing a cut to his eye.Local and general, Wairarapa Age, Volume XXXI, Issue 10713, 9 January 1913, Page 4 His father died on 21 July 1920.Obituary, Wairarapa Age, 22 July 1920, Page 5 He first married Evelyn Francis Graham in Sydney on 1 June 1926 and they had one child, a son. They divorced in 1948. On 18 May 1948 he married Henrietta Merenia Meteherangi Manawatu in 1948. Manawatu was of NgƒÅi Tahu and RangitƒÅne descent.

They divorced in June 1953. He died at Wellington on 21 May 1962. Career As a teenager Ramsden worked for the Bank of New South Wales at Wanganui and later as a shepherd on a farm near Castlepoint. He became a journalist for the Wairarapa Times-Age in 1919 when he was 20 years old. He moved to Auckland to work for the Auckland Star and then to Wellington where he worked for The New Zealand Times. In June 1924 he was employed by W H Morton Cameron of the Globe Encyclopedia Company of Chicago.Personal Items, Press, Volume LX, Issue 18095, 10 June 1924, Page 6 By the mid 1920s he had moved to Sydney where he worked for the Sydney Morning Herald.

In 1934 Ramsden switched to the Sydney-based Associated Newspapers Limited. Due to ill health Ramsden moved to Christchurch to work for the Press in 1942 where his journalistic focus was on history and Maori affairs. Moving back to Wellington in 1945, Ramsden joined the Evening Post becoming its diplomatic correspondent and art critic. He also wrote occasional article on topics of personal interest. Involvement with Maori Ramsden had an early interest in Maori. In 1924 he published an article on the early Maori newspaper Te Karere o Nui Tireni.Te Karere Maori, Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 272, 15 November 1924, Page 29 In August 1927 the Sun sent Ramsden to Turangawaewae marae at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia to interview Te Puea Herangi, a Tainui Princess. As a result of the meeting Ramsden became interested and involved in Maori and Maori-Pakeha relations. He published a feature article in the Sun on the Princess and her Model Village. When the Governor-General Sir Charles Fergusson visited Turangawaewae in April 1928 Ramsden covered the event for the newspaper. After these events Ramsden remained in contact with Herangi, visiting her and her family at Tahuna in January 1932. On this visit he met the native minister Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata with whom he corresponded for many years. During the 1950s Ramsden's Wellington home was used as a base by numerous Maori leaders for accommodation and meetings when they were in the capital on business with the Government. His children were encouraged to keep close contact with their Maori relatives. His involvement with Maori gained him recognition as a leading commentator on Maori Affairs. From 1949 he was consulted on Maori issues by the Prime Minister, Sidney Holland, and the minister of Maori Affairs, Ernest Corbett. He was recognised by Maori on marae and at major hui. Research and writing After joining Associated Newspapers Ramsden took an interest in anthropology. He attended lectures on the subject at the University of Sydney and founded the Pacific Islands Club (now known as the Polynesian Society). He was the club's first secretary. Later he became President of the Anthropological Society of New South Wales.Personal, Auckland Star, Volume LXX, Issue 16, 20 January 1939, Page 3 In 1935 he travelled with Charles Nordhoff to Tahiti and French Polynesia undertaking research.

He was also a member of PEN during this time and continued to be after his return to New Zealand. Once back in New Zealand Ramsden wrote Busby of Waitangi in 1942, Strange stories from the South Seas in 1944, Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata and Maori culture in 1948, and Rangiatea: the story of the Otaki church, its first pastor and its people in 1951.

Life and career Ilse von Randow was the daughter of Bruno Paul Eduard Henneberg, university professor, and Helene Mathilde Fritze. Her family was actively involved in artistic and scientific culture. In 1917 von Randow enrolled at the Berbenich art school in Darmstadt, where she studied until 1919 when changes in her family finances led her to quit her studies and returned home, taking up a job as a medical illustrator at Giessen University. In 1927, von Randow moved to China, to become a laboratory technician at T‚Äôung-Chi university, a German-language institute near Shanghai. She married Elgar Armin von Randow, German vice consul to Shanghai, in 1935: the couple had two sons, and divorced in 1945. Von Randow had been taught to weave by her mother and she turned to these skills to support herself and her children, designing fabrics for local textile companies. In 1949, when the communists took power in Shanghai in the Shanghai Campaign, von Randow sought refugee status for herself and her sons in New Zealand. They arrived in Auckland in April 1952. In Auckland, von Randow established herself as a leading figure in modernist craft, exhibiting widely and establishing a studio at the Auckland Art Gallery where she taught younger weavers including Zena Abbott and Ida Lough. Her loom had been dismantled and shipped from China to New Zealand, with which she started to create hand woven wall hangings that made her famous. In the mid 1960s, von Randow became disillusioned with what she saw as an anti-modernist attitude amongst craft practitioners in New Zealand. In 1966, she left for England, settling in West Mersea, where she retired from weaving and took up first batik and later painting. In 1992, von Randow returned to New Zealand. She died in Auckland on 18 October 1998, and her ashes were buried at Waikumete Cemetery.  Work  Von Randow's major public work was a set of curtains commissioned for the Auckland City Art Gallery in December 1957. Completed in 1958, the curtains were the largest piece of handweaving created in New Zealand at that date. The curtains are now held in the collection of the Auckland Museum. A retrospective of her work was held at the Auckland War Memorial Museum in 1998. She donated her workbooks and weaving samples from the length of her career to the museum. In 2013, von Randow's curtains were the subject of a project at the Auckland Art Gallery by contemporary New Zealand artist Ruth Buchanan.

History The idea for Ciudad Deportiva was one of five ideas that Mayor Maria Melendez Altieri had for permanent structures for Ponce during her administration. She called the five ideas the \\"emblematic\\" projects of her administration and dubbed the overall plan \\"Ponce Avanza\\" (Ponce Moves Forward). The original plan judged the initial cost of the Ciudad Deportiva at $4.5 million initially.Municipio de Ponce con d√©ficit menor.

In 2010, the mayor's plan for Ciudad Deportiva was presented before the Puerto Rico Senate. In early 2012 the first payment of $1,050,000 was made to CGC Builders to start construction work. Purpose The purpose of the complex is to \\"provide ... sports facilities in the city of Ponce for the celebration of sporting events lasting more than one day\\". Funding In February 2012, the sports campus has an initial projected total cost of $20 million USD. The municipality has secured US$6.3 million to start construction. In January 2012, the municipality of Ponce adjudicated US$1.05 million to GCG Builders to level the ground to commence the first phase of construction. This was revised in May 2012 to $32.3 million USD. Construction phases The Sports City will be developed in phases. Phase I will include construction of the three tennis courts and an area for extreme sports, including skateboarding. Phase II will encompass the baseball field, the track and field area, soccer field, and the central plaza. A future phase yet would include the soccer stadium.

The monastic buildings were located on the north side of the priory church. Traces of an infirmary were discovered in 1906, when the site of the Baptist Church was being prepared for building. The surviving buildings were the prior's lodgings.John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , p.397 The only recognisable surviving medieval feature is the \\"sumptuous mid-C15 oriel window\\" which is often erroneously described as having a connection with Geoffrey of Monmouth who lived over three centuries earlier,PRIORY STREET BOYS' SCHOOL; NATIONAL SCHOOL; OLD PRIORY BUILDINGS, MONMOUTH, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and which in fact is likely to have formed part of the priory gatehouse. The window contains three corbels in the form of carved heads of high quality, although there is some uncertainty as to exactly what they depict: Newman describing them as representing \\"an angel between a civilian and what may be a bedesman\\", whilst Kissack is more empathic in suggesting they portray \\"a knight, an angel and a miller.\\"Kissack, K. The Lordship, Parish and Borough of Monmouth, page 13 The prior's lodgings were extended on several occasions in the nineteenth century when they were used as St Mary's National School. The building was restored with the help of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Architect Keith Murray was commissioned to draw up plans for the renovation of the building, which was completed in 2002. It is now available for community use for events such as weddings, conferences and exhibitions. The Geoffrey Tapestry In December 2000 it was suggested that a wallhanging might be produced to illustrate the life of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Research, design and preparation took six months and the first stitches were worked in July 2001, at the festivities to celebrate the Priory's 900th anniversary. The work, measuring by , was completed in May 2003, after a combined effort by the 14 volunteers of 2,750 hours.Stitches and Stories- the Geoffrey Wall Hanging and How it Came to Be\\", colour booklet, published by Monmouth Priory, 2005. The background design is based on Kempe's ‚ÄòThe Four Rivers Window‚Äô in St Mary's Priory Church, Monmouth. A Celtic knot pattern gradually rises from green (earth) through blue (sky) to purple (heaven). These intertwining lines were also used by the Hereford School of Romanesque sculptors who were involved with the Priory at the end of the 11th century. A beaded motif from one of the capitals is used in the lower panels of each of the background. Of the three embroidered \\"windows\\", the central panel depicts Geoffrey of Monmouth, modelled on Father James Coutts who instigated the refurbishment of Monmouth Priory. He wears the black habit of the Benedictines. King Arthur with his Queen Guinevere, is being crowned at Caerleon by Dubricius (modelled on the Most Reverend Dr. Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury and former Bishop of Monmouth). Here the River Usk echoes the river theme of Kempe‚Äôs 19th century stained glass window. The Monnow and the Usk link up with the River Wye in the third panel. In this scene King Vortigern listens to the young Merlin telling him the legend of the red and white dragons. Vortigern, initially a lord of Gwent, was, according to legend, eventually killed at Ganarew above the Wye Valley. Linking the embroidered panels with the background are three circular designs in the lower panels. Beneath Geoffrey is the head of the angel that can be seen outside, sculpted underneath \\"Geoffrey‚Äôs Window\\". Below Arthur is his shield, \\"Pridwen\\", with its image of the Virgin Mary, whilst \\"Caliburn\\", his sword, can be seen in the initial ‚ÄòA‚Äô.

Introduced in 2012, the theme introduced the \\"mini-doll\\" figures, which are about the same size as the traditional minifigures but are more detailed and realistic. The sets include pieces in many color schemes such as orange and green or pink and purple, and depict scenes from suburban life set in the fictional town of Heartlake City. The main characters, one of which appears in every set, are Andrea, Emma, Mia, Olivia and Stephanie. The sets are usually named after them. In 2018, Lego revamped the minidolls and gave them new looks. The Friends product range replaced Lego's previous female-oriented theme Lego Belville, which had been in production since 1994, and featured dolls that were much larger than both the mini-dolls and minifigures. Other related product ranges have included Homemaker (1971‚Äì1982), Paradisa (1991‚Äì1997) and Scala (1997‚Äì2001). Release history Lego Friends was launched in January 2012 in North America (December 2011 in France), with 14 sets being released. Overall the first wave included 23 sets and features five core characters, named Andrea, Emma, Mia, Olivia and Stephanie, in suburban settings. In the initial release the larger sets include bricks that can build a veterinary clinic, a malt-style caf√©, a beauty salon and a suburban house; smaller sets included a \\"cool convertible,\\" a design studio, an inventor's workshop and a swimming pool. Subsequent waves were released in future years, expanding on various interests of the characters and their friends. Specific themes have ranged from various vocational, recreational and academic interests to agriculture, equestrianism, wildlife animal rescue and rehabilitation, and pop stardom, all complementing suburbia-themed sets, as well as an Amusement park and skiing theme. The largest sets since the original wave have included Summer Riding Camp, Heartlake Shopping Mall and Heartlake Grand Hotel. Lego has also released accompanying products branded under the Friends theme. These include a picture frame which includes 49 Lego elements which is available from Lego brand stores and a display stand which includes 17 elements that was released as a promotional polybag. Amy Corbett was involved in Lego Friends from the beginning, and Bas Brederode has designed many Lego Friends sets and parts. In 2018, the LEGO Friends line released minor changes to the main characters. Mia's eyes changed from brown to green while her hair was changed from an actual red to true orange-based red, Emma and Andrea's eyes changed from green to brown and Andrea's got earrings, Olivia's skin became slightly darker and she got glasses (specifically blue glasses) and also now wore her hair up in a ponytail braid, and Stephanie's smile was made a little bigger, and hair a lighter shade of blond, as it was dark blond in the original series. In 4th June 2019, it was announced that more sets were be released in 1st July 2019 and inspired by marine biologists. Sales According to NPR, Lego Friends are \\"one of the biggest successes in Lego's history ... The line doubled sales expectations in 2012, the year it launched. Sales to girls tripled in just that year.\\" The success has caused other construction-set companies such as Mega Blocks to introduce girl dolls.

She worked in New Zealand, Australia and England. After her career in theatre she became a romantic novelist.  Early life  Rosemary Frances Rees was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1875 or 1876 to William Lee Rees, a barrister and MP. From a young age she was determined to become an actress.  Career  Rees worked as an actress in New Zealand before moving to England in about 1900 or 1901. In 1901 she joined Fanny Brough's theatre company becoming Brough's understudy after one month. Her first one act play 'The New Gun' was performed as a curtain raiser to 'Uncles and Aunts', by William Lestocq and Walter Everard, in 1902. She also toured with the companies of Mr and Mrs Lewis Waller, Fred Ash, Walter Melville and Mr Van Biene among others. She wrote articles and short stories for the magazines Madame, The King and M.A.P. Several of her one act plays were produced in this period: in 1907 'A Judicial Separation' in Manchester and 'Her Dearest Friend' in London; 'A Desperate Marriage' in Brighton in 1908; 'The Happiest Woman in the World' in Bournemouth in 1909. In 1908 she returned to New Zealand. In 1909 she presented, at His Majesty's Theatre in Gisborne, an evening's entertainment which included three of her own one act plays: the comedy A Judicial Separation', the drama 'The New Gun and the comedietta 'Her Dearest Friend'. Rees returned to England in 1911 where she continued to act, write and produce plays. In 1913 she produced and acted in her comedy sketch, Uncle Bill, at the Grand Theatre, Clapham. It was also produced at The Globe Theatre in London and The Vaudeville Theatre in The Strand, London (as a curtain raiser to Jerome K. Jerome's play Robina in Search of a Husband). In 1915 she acted in her own one act play 'Will You Walk into my Parlour' at the Artillery in Woolwich; it was a curtain raiser for H.A. Vachell's play 'Searchlights'. She had a starring role in 'Searchlights'. In 1914 Rees took an injunction (Rees vs. Robbins) against theatre managers Walter and Frederick Robbins, better known as Walter and Frederick Melville, for infringement of copyright. Rees sought to prevent performances of the Melville's play 'The Beggar Girl's Wedding' on the grounds that it had great similarities to a play she had written in 1906 called 'A Beggar Bride' and which had been read by the Melvilles; she had changed the title of the play to 'A Desperate Marriage' and it was performed in Brighton in 1908. The court found there had been no infringement of copyright because as melodramas they would have many similarities in their plots and stock characters. During World War 1 Rees decided to dedicate herself to the war effort. Initially she worked on the New Zealand War Contingent Association's Entertainment Committee entertaining New Zealand soldiers in England; she gave out 20,000 tickets to New Zealand soldiers which she obtained from her contacts in the theatre world. By 1917 her health had deteriorated from overwork on the Entertainments Committee and, ordered to rest, she was offered a free trip to New Zealand by the military authorities. Instead, in early 1918, she joined one of Lena Ashwell's touring theatrical companies (the Lena Ashwell Dramatic Party), based in Rouen, entertaining the troops. She did this for 14 months; after the Armistice the Dramatic Party entertained the wounded at Ypres in Belgium and at Arras and Douai in Northern France. After recovering in London from a breakdown in 1919 she returned to New Zealand where she managed her own touring theatre company; one of the actors was the writer Ngaio Marsh. In 1921 her theatre company, The Rosemary Rees English Comedy Company, performed The Mollusc by Hubert Henry Davies in Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin, and other small towns. It also performed Rees's own plays 'Will You Walk into my Parlour' and the comedy 'The Amateur Adventuress' . The company foundered after three to five months because Rees was unable to pay salaries and she moved to Australia to find work in the theatre there, though she returned to New Zealand to tour with the J.C. Williamson company in 1922. While in Australia she had begun to write romantic novels, giving up acting to become a successful writer. Her novels were published in England and the United States. During the 1920s and 1930 Rees travelled and worked in Australia, England and America. In 1938 she was living in London and was sometimes mistaken for an airwoman with the same name. During World War II she lived in London with her sister May; they returned to New Zealand in 1955. Rees died in Chelsea Private Hospital in Gisborne on 19 August 1963. Rosemary Rees was well known in New Zealand, Australia and England as a writer and actor. She attempted to create a permanent theatre in New Zealand, but competition from cinema and radio plus the country's small population and high cost of touring made touring theatre unviable. She is most remembered for her success as a romantic novelist.

Habitat types that feature the grass include pinyon-juniper woodland and mesquite, creosote, and grassy shrubsteppe. It does best on land that is flooded for a few days and then dries up. It also grows on drier soils, and it is somewhat drought- tolerant. It grows on clay with honey mesquite and other species such as burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolius), alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides) and sacaton (S. wrightii) and other dropseed grasses (Sporobolus spp.), grama grasses (Bouteloua spp.), muhly grasses (Muhlenbergia spp.), and tarbush (Flourensia cernua). Uses Tobosa is an important forage for cattle and horses in the American Southwest. It is productive and palatable until it becomes rough at maturity. It is especially valuable during drought when it persists after other grasses die. It can be cut into hay when still green. In Texas, it yields 1000 pounds per acre, and this can be increased with careful and deliberate management. In areas with adequate precipitation, burning is used to remove litter, which then stimulates the stems to produce more green matter. The grass can cause ergot poisoning if eaten when infested with the fungus.

He was notable for making Stratford the second or third New Zealand town to have an electricity supply, for constructing the first steam-powered motor car in the country, and for creating an innovative milking machine. Family Reid was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on 14 September 1853. His parents were Alexander Reid, a carter, and Helen Reid. The family emigrated to New Zealand in 1860, arriving at Lyttelton on the William Miles on 21 August. They took up farming at Southbridge and later moved to Springfield. Reid is thought to have possibly been trained as an apprentice by Scott Brothers in Christchurch. On 28 June 1876 Reid married Janet Whyte at Christchirch and moved to Opunake in 1882. Reid bought land on Bird Road, Ngaere, which he farmed. From about 1898 they lived in Stratford. The Reids had seven children. He was described as a hard man and a perfectionist. Reid was also a reasonably good photographer with many of his photos now in the Puke Ariki collection. Janet Reid died on 13 November 1918, an early victim of the influenza epidemic. On 26 March 1926, at Wharehuia near Stratford, Reid married a widow, Ellen Anne Richmond. Reid died at Stratford on 21 November 1938. Civic affairs Reid took served as a justice of the peace, a member of the Ngaire Road Board, and a Councillor on the Stratford County Council. He was involved in forming a cooperative dairy packing company and the opening of the Waitara Freezing Works. Reid was a Freemason and the first master of the Stratford lodge. He was a grand lodge officer. Inventor and entrepreneur In Canterbury Reid went into partnership operating a threshing machine which he had modified. Electricity supply He was instrumental in bringing electricity to Stratford, demonstrating electric lighting and cooking to the Stratford Town Board when they were considering installing either gas or electricity. Reid had joined with Adam Porter of Cardiff to put on the display and make a proposal to the council in opposition to a Mr Watt from Balclutha who had proposed a water gas system. The Taranaki Herald's local agent wrote against the Reid/Porter proposal. Reid's proposal to supply electricity to the town prevailed and, after arranging financial backing, he formed the Stratford Electrical Supply Company in 1898.The Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Taranaki, Hawke's Bay & Wellington Provincial Districts], Electric Light An act of Parliament was required to allow a private companies to supply electricity. Stratford was the third town in New Zealand, after Reefton in 1887 and Wellington in 1888, to have electric street lighting. Straford went live in 1890. The company built a hydroelectric power station on the Patea River. It consisted of a wooden dam and a tunnel approximately 100 yards long complete with a surge chamber. Two penstocks led water to turbines driving alternators which had been imported from England. The plant produced single-phase alternating current at 40 cycles and 2,200 volts, and had a capacity of 90 kilowatts. In town the voltage was reduced to 105 volts for domestic consumption. Parts of the installations remain. Steam-powered vehicles Reid next turned his attention to self-propelled vehicles. Between 1903 and 1906 he produced three steam-driven cars. The engines and boilers were imported from America, with modifications and bodywork completed in Stratford. The cars were two-cylinder, chain-driven and powered by kerosene, and had a rating of about four horsepower. Before general vehicle registration was introduced Reid's personal car carried the number plate SD1 (Stratford District 1). He stopped working on the cars' development as he thought petrol engines were more likely. He sold two of the cars and kept one for himself. James Livingston of Patea owned one of the first Reid cars. Its steam engine ran on a small primus burner under a tank of water. When Livingston bought a Darracq in 1904 the Reid was destroyed. Its engine was removed and used by a local farmer to run a pump, and the chassis was converted into a trailer. The trailer was sold in the 1920s or '30s. Milking machine At the same time he was producing his steam cars, Reid was also developing a mechanical milking machine. Innovations included were a variable-speed pulsator and rubber cups with reinforced sections which simulated the natural sucking action of a calf. Mechanical milkers of the time were difficult to clean and therefore created a danger of contaminated milk. Reid's AWR machine was designed to be easy to clean. He founded the AWR Milking Machine Company Limited to produce and market the machine. He also had it patented.NZ patent 44764 The first AWR machines came on the market in about 1907 and were sold as far away as Australia. The application for a patent for his machine was challenged in Australia in 1913 with the Commissioner of Patents. Reid was granted a hearing. \\"Pop top\\" caravan In his later years, Reid created his own caravan. His first was a pop-top in which one pulled a rope, the top came up and the sides came down. The next was made from a hardboard-like material.

In 1911, when Reidy was 31, she received formal training at the Waikato Hospital for three years. Military service Reidy served in the military from January 1916 to December 1918. Initially posted in England she nursed at the No 1 New Zealand Stationary Hospital at Wisques, France from 1917‚Äì1918. She was very kind to the men, who nicknamed her \\"Ten Franc Reidy\\" for the money she lent to soldiers. She concluded her service after the hospital closed. Kawhia Hospital After a brief stint training nurses at Waikato Hospital, Reidy took control of the cottage hospital in Kawhia which faced closure due to finances. She was a tyrant, but a loving one. She worked for twenty-six years at various fundraisers to keep the hospital solvent.

It was heard in the Appellate Division by Watermeyer CJ, Centlivres JA, Schreiner JA, Van Den Heever JA and Fagan AJA on 7 and 8 June 1949, with judgment on 21 June.  Facts  In the case of a contract involving reciprocal obligations, a breach by one party of one of his obligations will usually only give the other a right to treat the contract as discharged if the breach is one which evinces an intention on the part of the defaulter no longer to be bound by the terms of the contract for the future, or if the defaulter has broken a promise, the fulfilment of which is essential to the continuation of the contractual tie. In May 1947, Morton purchased a forest and agreed to be bound by a contract between the then-owner Aucamp, whereby the latter had acquired the right, on certain conditions, to fell and remove timber from the forest. In July, Morton directed his agent \\"G,\\" in charge of felling operations, to discontinue them. After a discussion of the terms of the contract with Aucamp, Morton then cancelled the contract and refused to allow Aucamp access to the forest. Aucamp thereupon instituted an action claiming an order restraining Morton from interfering with his rights under the contract and for damages. In his plea, Morton set up the defence * that Aucamp had broken the contract; and * that he, Morton, had therefore been justified in denying him access to the forest. In his claim in reconvention, Morton asked * for an order cancelling the contract; and * for damages. A Local Division found in favour of Morton and granted an order cancelling the contract, relying on a breach by Aucamp in that he had failed to remove all sound and merchantable timber, of that felled by him, complying with the measurements mentioned in a clause of the contract.  Judgment  In Aucamp's appeal, the Appellate Division held, on the facts, inter alia, * that the amount of timber which had been left to rot did not amount to a large quantity; * that it did no harm to the forest; * that the contract specified no time limit within which felled timber had to be removed; * that Morton himself had attached little importance to this breach; * that it was not due to any deliberate act on the part of the appellant but to neglect on the part of one of his servants; and * that it was very easily remediable. Neither this breach, accordingly, nor another relating to payment which the trial court had found proved, were sufficient to justify the respondent in regarding the contractual relationship between himself and the appellant as thereby terminated. An order was therefore granted restraining the respondent from preventing Aucamp from lawfully exercising his rights under the agreement. As to Aucamp's claim for damages, the court held that the correct basis for calculation of them would not be the hypothesis that he had entirely lost the profit which he would have made out of particular contracts which he had lost; it was that his making of profits from cutting and selling timber had been deferred for about 22 months owing to his operations in the forest having been stopped. As Aucap had failed to prove the facts necessary for the court to make a calculation of damages on this basis, it was ruled that there should be judgment of absolution from the instance on this prayer. The decision of the Eastern District Local Division, in Morton v Aucamp, was thereby reversed.  References   Books  * Du Plessis, Jacques, et al. The Law of Contract in South Africa.

Publication history Finesse first appeared in Avengers Academy #1 (June 2010) and was created by Christos Gage and Mike McKone. She appeared as a regular character in the series through its final issue #39 (Jan 2013). Fictional character biography Finesse's past is one not all too clear, as her parents were once criminals who trained under Taskmaster, her abilities as a polymath manifested at a young age which stunted her emotional growth and social abilities, making her very unsociable at times. She was approached by Norman Osborn and accepted his offer, and in fact was a willing participant in his test, only making her better while giving Osborn what he wanted. Finesse is recruited into the Avengers Academy along with five other students who have been affected by Osborn. Finesse blackmails Quicksilver into training her the way Magneto trained him. She figures out that she may, in fact, be the genetic daughter of Taskmaster, but due to his position during Dark Reign all possible evidence has been deleted or sealed. They have a confrontation but no straight answer as the information of his \\"Photographic reflexes\\" overwrites his actual memories so he can't remember the previous day, let alone the year she was born, but knows it's a possibility. After a sparring session, so Taskmaster can remember her movements at least knowing she's possibly his child, they part ways. Her ability to perceive even the slightest facial movements makes her a human lie detector. He is able to deduce that Jeremy Briggs, also a former Osbourne torture victim, is trying to manipulate the students to quit the team and join his evil corporation.Avengers Academy #15 Despite her lack of emotions, she volunteers to sacrifice herself to save the rest of the team from Greithoth: Breaker of Wills and Skirn: Breaker of Men during the \\"Fear Itself\\" storyline.

It is revealed that she has completely lost her memory and can only remember people by their movements. She divorced Reptil due to the emotional strain on both of them and their daughter, as well as the fear that she will treat her daughter as her father treated her.Avengers Academy Vol.1 #25 Finesse became friends with X-23 due to their lack of emotion.Avengers Academy Vol.1 #29 Finesse also stood by X-23 when she opposed the X-Men locking their students on the Academy grounds during the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline.Avengers Academy Vol.1 #31 However, their friendship took a turn for the worse when Jeremy Briggs tried to release a superhuman cure. After Briggs took out X-23 and tried to acid burn her, Finesse grabs X-23's arms and fatally stabs Briggs in the radial and femoral arteries, causing him to bleed profusely. She begins to wrap him a tourniquet, but then changes her mind and lets him bleed out.Avengers Academy Vol.1 #37 X-23 first thought she killed him, but when she finds out it was Finesse, she was furious. X-23 agrees to keep Finesse's secret, but declares they are no longer friends, upsetting Finesse. The faculty promotes the students, and Finesse immediately hits the databanks to test out her new security clearance, loading beta files.Avengers Academy Vol.1 #39 She is still with the Academy and is undisturbed by Reptil and X-23's mysterious disappearance caused by Arcade.Avengers Arena #13 Finesse is featured in the four-part series called 'Infinity: The Hunt'. A friendly competition between various schools for super-powered teenagers turns serious when intergalactic terrorist Thanos targets all of Earth's young super-beings. Finesse's new classmate 'Crimson' is murdered in the initial attack. The various schools work together to survive and bring the attack back to Thanos' forces.Infinity: The Hunt #1-4 (2013) Finesse appears in the pages of Avengers Undercover where she and Striker visit Hazmat in the S.H.I.E.L.D. detention center after Hazmat apparently killed Arcade.Avengers Undercover #4 (2014) Finesse is part of an A.I.M. team kidnapping G.I.R.L. from a scientific exhibition led by Nadia Van Dyne, the current Wasp. A.I.M. had fooled their soldiers into believing that the attack, while violent, was ultimately intended to benefit the Earth through forced defensive weaponry invention. The A.I.M. team is rebelled, all members ultimately captured. Finesse, along with other A.I.M. soldiers, is allowed 'probation' via working with Wasp, her scientists and the Avengers. Finesse's skills were suitable for bodyguard needs and repeated, exact repetitions of scientific experiments.The Unstoppable Wasp #9-10 (2019) Powers and abilities Finesse has been a polymath since the age of five; she is able learn a vast amount of knowledge at an accelerated rate -anything from languages, varied skills, fighting techniques, etc. The similarity in this ability to Taskmaster's 'photographic reflexes' has caused Finesse to suspect that Taskmaster may be her actual father, but after a confrontation with him, the suspicions remain unconfirmed. Taskmaster did alert her to the same problem he has faced with his abilities -that over time older memories become lost, overwritten as new skills are learned. This was in part shown to be a possibility in an alternate future where Finesse was only able to remember people by their movements.Avengers Academy Vol.1 #25 Finesse's ability to perceive minute facial movements has enabled her to become a human lie-detector.Avengers Academy #15 References Category:Characters created by Christos Gage Category:Comics characters introduced in 2010 Category:Female characters in comics Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes Category:Marvel Comics superheroes ","title":"Finesse (comics)"},{"id":"34370418","text":"Sarur (, also Romanized as Sar≈´r) is a village in Tang-e Haft Rural District, Papi District, Khorramabad County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

It was heard in the Transvaal Provincial Division by Tindall J and Greenberg J.  Facts  An agreement between Strachan and Prinsloo imposed on the former the duty of managing the latter's farm so as to relieve him of all duties of supervision. In spite of warnings, Strachan persistently and continuously failed to attend early in the morning and late in the evening, which was when important duties of supervising had to be done, with the result that those duties had to be performed by Prinsloo. Finally, on three successive days, Strachan did not appear on the farm at all, whereupon Prinsloo cancelled the agreement.  Judgment  The court held * that, in order to determine whether or not the cancellation was justified, the test to be applied was whether or not Strachan had failed to perform a vital term, express or implied, of the agreement; * that an important factor in deciding whether such a term was vital was the question of whether or not Prinsloo would have entered into the agreement in the absence of such term; * that Strachan had in fact failed to perform a vital term; and * that Prinsloo was therefore justified in terminating the agreement. A serious violation of duty by one party, in other words, justifies the other in terminating the contract.  References   Books  * Du Plessis, Jacques, et al. The Law of Contract in South Africa.

In the elections of 2015 he was reelected with 43,78% of the votes, thus managing to continue his term until December 2019.  Biography  During his youth he got involved in the Radical Civic Union at the University of Buenos Aires Faculty in Law. In recent years he has been a shipowner of alliances of radicals and macristas. He was pointed out of having closeness to the Judiciary, especially in the City of Buenos Aires.Angelici: \\"Me gustar√≠a saber qu√© es un operador judicial, el Gobierno no necesita eso\\" on Pol√≠tica Argentina, 4 Ago 2018 Angelici became one of the most important gambling entrepreneurs in Argentina, with an empire that led him to be the head of the Argentine Chamber of Bingo Halls and Annexes (\\"C√°mara Argentina de Salas de Bingos y Anexos\\", abbreviated \\"CASBA\\"), with interests in five betting companies and a racehorse stud.Daniel Angelici on El Diario del Juego Angelici served until 2010 as treasurer of Boca Juniors during the management of Jorge Amor Ameal. It was the focus of a controversy in 2010 when he opposed the renewal of the contract of club's idol Juan Rom√°n Riquelme, because according to him, the institution could not afford to pay a high dollar contract for four years of an elderly player. Finally, the renewal of the contract was carried out due to the great interest of the former president of the club Ameal in continuing to count on Riquelme in the team. As a result, Angelici resigned his position as treasurer of the club. Jorge A. Ameal rompi√≥ el silencio on Cancha Llena, La Naci√≥n In 2011 Angelici decided to run for the presidency with the support of the then Head of Government of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, winning with 54% of the votes, presenting more than 24,000 voters at the polls as a historical record. Thus, he defeated the official candidate Jorge Amor Ameal. On December 14 he assumed the new president of Boca Juniors. On December 6, 2015, with the club having won both titles, the league championship and Copa Argentina, elections were held again at the club. After a record election for the institution, in which 26,136 members voted, Daniel Angelici managed to be reelected with 43.78% ‚Äî11 421 votes‚Äî, against 30.91% of former President Jorge Amor Ameal and 25.13% of opposition candidate Jos√© Beraldi.Angelici ser√° presidente por otros 4 a√±os Clar√≠n, 7 Dec 2015 Thus, he was in office four more years until December 2019, with Rodolfo Ferrari as vice president.  Management   Boca Juniors  During his management of Boca Juniors, the registration of club members was reopened under the modality of \\"adherent member\\" (idea made by the previous management); the possibility granted to current active members to register their children under 18 as members of the club (\\"father and child member\\"). He was criticized for continuing with the position of not selling tickets for Boca Juniors supporters in the league games that the club played at La Bombonera. In that way, only members (active and a small limited number of adherent members who paid their tickets) and subscribers could attend league matches only.Pergolini apunt√≥ contra la dirigencia anterior de Boca por los lugares en la Bombonera: \\"Hab√≠a cosas muy raras\\", Infobae, 25 Jan 2019 However, the club started selling seats for the general public in 2012 Copa Libertadores matches.

On July 5, 2012, Juan Rom√°n Riquelme left the institution. As mentioned above, two years before Angelici had refused to renew the player. Finally, just 6 months after Angelici's administration as president, Riquelme decided to leave the club.Riquelme: \\"no voy a seguir m√°s en Boca\\" on TN Angelici then decided to take 30 days of vacation, during the pass market, returning days before the start of the next tournament.Angelici contra Riquelme tras las vacaciones on Infobae During the 2012 Copa Sudamericana, there were incidents at the Boca stadium and a few days later a confrontation with handguns between Boca members, however Angelici refused to apply the right of admission, arguing that there was no reason to do so.Angelici: \\"¬øCu√°l es el motivo para aplicar el derecho de admisi√≥n?\\", La Naci√≥n, 27 Aug 2012 Under the Angelici's administration, Boca Juniors added eight reinforcements to the football team, some brought from Europe, such as Daniel OsvaldoDaniel Osvaldo firmar√° con Boca por seis meses, La Voz, 9 Feb 2015 or Nicol√°s Lodeiro,Lodeiro llega y firma con Boca, Clar√≠n, 1 Feb 2015 although they did not last a long time in the club.

Functions with this property are sometimes also known as Herglotz, Pick or R functions. Integral representation Every Nevanlinna function N admits a representation : N(z) = C + Dz + \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda - z} - \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{1+\\\\lambda^2} \\\\right) d\\\\mu(\\\\lambda), \\\\quad z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{H}, where C is a real constant, D is a non-negative constant and Œº is a Borel measure on R satisfying the growth condition : \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\frac{d\\\\mu(\\\\lambda)}{1+\\\\lambda^2} < \\\\infty. Conversely, every function of this form turns out to be a Nevanlinna function.

In a career that lasted from July 1846 to June 1849 he ran twenty-two times and won three races. In 1847 he proved himself one of the best British colts of his generation, winning Derby and being narrowly beaten in the St Leger. Although he continued to run well in important staying races for the next five seasons, he failed to win another race and was retired to stud in after running once as an eight-year-old in 1852. No subsequent winner of the Epsom Derby has run beyond the age of five. He was later exported to stand as a stallion in France. Background Cossack was a dark chestnut horse standing 15.2 hands high, described by the Farmer's Magazine as having a \\"neat blood-like head\\", \\"clean shoulders\\" and \\"very muscular quarters\\". He was sired by the Northumberland Plate winner Hetman Platoff out of the mare Joannina, a descendant of the influential broodmares Filagree, Web and Penelope. Cossack was bred at Billing in Northamptonshire by R. C. Elwes. In 1845 the trainer John Day together with a Mr Dilly, visited Elwes stable to view his yearlings. Dilly was unimpressed by the small, upright chestnut but Day thought differently and, after some negotiation, bought him for 200 guineas on behalf of his patron T. H. Pedley, a bookmaker from Huddersfield. Cossack was sent to be trained at Day's stable at Danebury in Hampshire. Racing career 1846: two-year-old season Cossack performed impressively in trial gallops at Danebury and had built up a considerable reputation before appearing on a racecourse. His first public run in July 1846 at Newmarket when he started favourite for the July Stakes. He ran poorly, however and finished only third to the filly Miami, who went on to win the following year's Epsom Oaks. Cossack did not race again in 1846. 1847: three-year-old season At Newmarket's spring meeting, Cossack started 6/5 favourite and won the Newmarket Stakes, beating War Eagle by a length, with the pair pulling well clear and leaving the other runners in \\"a cloud of dust\\". At the same meeting, Cossack's stable companion, Conyngham, won the 2000 Guineas, and John Day found himself the trainer of the two leading Derby contenders. The Derby was run on 19 May and Cossack started 5/1 second favourite behind Conyngham on 5/2 in a field of thirty-two runners, the largest ever assembled for the race. Even by the usual standards, the crowd was immense, with a \\"countless multitude\\" arriving via the newly opened Epsom railway station. After the police had cleared the spectators from the course, the race began with a clean start. Ridden by Sim Templeman, Cossack was second in the early stages, but moved into the lead by half way and soon opened up a clear advantage and was being cheered by the crowd as the likely winner half a mile from the finish. He was still three lengths in front in the straight and the only challenge came from War Eagle who moved almost level in the final furlong before being \\"shaken off\\". Cossack won easily by a length from War Eagle, with Van Tromp, who had been badly hampered early in the race, a further four lengths back in third. The value of the race was ¬£5,250. At Royal Ascot in June, Cossack was allowed to walk over for the Swinley Stakes, when the other runners where withdrawn. At Doncaster in September, Cossack ran in the St Leger. He started favourite at odds of 4/5 despite doubts about his stamina and the fact that Pedley \\"declared to win\\" with his other runner, Foreclosure. Templeman attempted to repeat his Epsom tactics and sent Cossack into the lead from the start. By the straight most of his rivals were struggling but Van Tromp, ridden by Job Marson made steady progress and moved alongside the favourite a furlong and a half from the finish. Marson sent his colt past the leader and Templeman, realising he was beaten, eased Cossack down in the closing stages to finish second, two lengths behind the winner but well clear of the rest. On 12 October, Cossack appeared at Newmarket for the two and a quarter mile Cesarewitch Handicap for which he was set a weight of 118 pounds, including a six-pound weight penalty for finishing second in the St Leger. He finished fourth, behind the four-year-old Cawroush, who was carrying 98 pounds. His performance was creditable and reportedly led to speculation that he could have won the St Leger, had he not been ridden so aggressively. Cossack's winnings for the season totaled ¬£5,950, making him the second highest earner of the British season behind the Duke of Richmond's Red Hart. 1848: four-year-old season Cossack ran twice without success at Goodwood in July 1848. On the Tuesday of the meeting he faced Van Tromp in a ¬£300 Sweepstakes over three and a half miles. Van Tromp led from the start and Cossack, who was eased down when his chance had gone, was beaten by an estimated 150 yards. Two days later the two colts met yet again in the Goodwood Cup over two and a half miles. Cossack raced prominently in the early part of the race but made no impression in the later stages and finished unplaced and tailed-off behind Van Tromp. 1849: five-year-old season Cossack reappeared as a five-year-old in the two and a quarter mile Tradesman's Plate at Chester on 2 May. The handicap attracted a field of twenty-nine runners and Cossack was assigned 125 pounds, meaning that he had to concede weight to all but one of his opponents. The race was run at a slow pace and Frank Butler, riding Cossack, found himself trapped behind a \\"ruck\\" of horses on the final turn. Butler was forced to pull the horse to the wide outside and Cossack produced a strong finishing run, but failed by a \\"half neck\\" to catch Malton, a four-year-old to whom he was conceding thirty-one pounds. In June Cossack ran twice at Royal Ascot. In the Gold Vase he was involved in a close finish, dead-heating with the filly Canezou for second place, a head behind the winner Glenalvon, after looking the likely winner. A day later, Cossack ran in the Emperor of Russia's Plate, in front of a large crowd which included the Queen and Prince Albert. He finished third, beaten two lengths, behind Van Tromp and Chanticleer, in a race which, according to Bell's Life, created an \\"extraordinary degree of excitement\\". 1850: six- year-old season On his six-year-old debut, Cossack again traveled to Chester for the Tradesman's Plate, but on this occasion he finished unplaced under top weight of 128 pounds. At Goodwood on 1 August he finished a well- beaten third of the seven runners behind Canezou in the Goodwood Cup. On 4 September Cossack appeared at Warwick, where he finished fifth, carrying top weight of 120 pounds in the two mile Leamington Stakes, giving at least twenty-seven pounds to the four horses who finished in front of him. 1851:seven-year-old season In July he ran for the third time in the Goodwood Cup and was narrowly defeated after his strong late run failed by a head against the filly Nancy, who was receiving twenty-four pounds according to weight-for-age rules. After the race Pedley demanded a veterinary examination to determine the filly's true age: she was confirmed to be a three-year-old In August he appeared at Brighton Racecourse where he finished second of the fourteen runners to Lord George in the Brighton Stakes. At Doncaster at the St Leger meeting in September, Cossack ran unplaced under top weight in the Great Yorkshire Handicap and was beaten the following day in a match race by the mare Maid of Masham. 1852:eight-year-old season On 23 June, Cossack, giving at least twenty-six pounds to his opponents, finished third to the three-year-old Stilton in the Northumberland Purse. Assessment Cossack's Derby win was seen as a rather fortunate one, owing a great deal to Templeman's enterprising tactics and the interference encountered by Van Tromp, who beat him decisively in all their subsequent meetings. Henry Hall Dixon (\\"The Druid\\") described him as \\"a delightful horse to ride, never pulling and always as ready as a shot\\". Stud career Cossack retired to stand at Stanton, near Shifnal in Shropshire at a fee of 10 guineas for the 1853-1854 season and was sold to Mr. Boythorpe and relocated to Derbyshire in 1855. He stood as a stallion in England until 1857, when he was sold to the French Imperial Stud for 25,000 francs. The best of his offspring was Gamester, a colt who won the St Leger in 1856. Another of his sons, Alcibiade, won the Grand National in 1865.

The jail covered an area of about an acre, with a chapel, infirmary, living quarters and a treadmill. It was closed in 1869.Gaol, Hereford Street, Monmouth, Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments in Wales, accessed January 2012 In 1884 most of the building was demolished, and today nothing remains but the gatehouse which is a Grade II listed building. Within the gatehouse, there exists \\"a representation in coloured glass of the complete original buildings\\". It is one of 24 buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. History The gaol was designed by William Blackburn and constructed between 1788 and 1790. It was designed as a reformed gaol, following the principles of the first prison reformer John Howard. The first Governor was James Baker, who received ¬£100 per annum. The gaol cost around ¬£5,000 to build, on land procured from Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort and was constructed of local stone, some 18,000 tons of which was removed from a quarry situated in Lower Redbrook. A nineteenth-century print gives an idea of the gaol's size and strength, and shows the gatehouse in the centre of the south wall. Contemporary descriptions speak of \\"a massive building looking more like a castle than a gaol, having high outer walls and an inner building complete with tall round bastions\\". It was commended \\"for the commodious distribution of the whole, the airiness of the compartments, the propriety of the regulations, and the strict attention paid to the cleanliness and morals of the prisoners\\". Inmates imprisoned in the gaol for debt could expect a bedstead, sheets, two blankets in the winter and a rug. They would also be given a sixpenny loaf four times a year as the result of a bequest of a Monmouth man who left ¬£100 for that purpose. Generally, the prisoners' diet was poor in the extreme. Felons were allowed 1d of bread a day, but there was no allowance for debtors.Keith Kissack ‚Äì 'Monmouth ‚Äì The Making of a County Town' Chap VII Page 215 John Howard, the penal reformer, noted that many debtors survived on 'water soup' ‚Äì soup which consisted of bread boiled in water. The longer the time a prisoner spent in gaol, the more food they were allowed, receiving such extras as an additional pint of oatmeal gruel for breakfast, 4ozs of cooked meat and 12ozs of potatoes twice a week and a pint of broth twice a week.Keith Kissack ‚Äì 'Monmouth ‚Äì The Making of a County Town' Chap VII, Pg 219 This diet, lacking as it did any significant quantity of Vitamin C, led to many of the longer term prisoners suffering from scurvy. As late as 1851 the Merlin, the local paper, noted that \\"the diet in the County Gaol is now confined to oatmeal porridge, milk and bread; meat and vegetables not being allowed. It is said that the knowledge of this spartan fare has already had a good effect outside the prison walls.\\"The Merlin, 1851 The message being that would-be criminals would be deterred from crime simply by knowing how dreadful prison fare actually was. Prisoners were so weakened by this diet however, that in 1853, when typhus broke out, they were unable to resist the disease which quickly spread killing at least one prisoner.Keith Kissack ‚Äì 'Monmouth ‚Äì The Making of a County Town' Chap VII, Pg 220 North Parade House which is on the right. The three Chartist leaders, John Frost, Zephaniah Williams, William Jones, and others were imprisoned in the gaol after conviction at Shire Hall, Monmouth for treason on 16 January 1840. Their sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering was eventually commuted, by the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne, to transportation to Tasmania. At that time hangings were carried out on the flat roof of the gatehouse. Two Irishmen, Maurice Murphy and Patrick Sullivan, were sentenced for the joint murder of Jane Lewis and were publicly executed, on 23 September 1850, on the roof. Their execution was watched from the grassy slopes of what is now Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls, by a crowd of about 3,000, of whom \\"about four-fifths were estimated to be of the softer sex\\".The Monmouthshire Gazette, September 1850 Executions were carried out in public there until nine years later (23 September 1859), when Matthew Francis was hanged for the murder of his wife. The illustration shows that the Gatehouse originally had castellated parapets and cross loops on the south elevation, so the current pitched roof and windows of the private house probably date from after its closure in 1869. The huge recessed archway remains, however, though with a domestic front door built into it. When the gaol was closed in 1869, the prisoners were transferred to the New Gaol in Usk. The main buildings were demolished in 1884 and the stone was sold for building at Rock Crescent, now Monkswell Road, in Monmouth (just across from the Old Gaol), and at Sharpness Docks. The Cottage Hospital was built on part of the site between the years 1902 and 1903. Today nothing remains of the gaol but the square Old Red Sandstone gatehouse, which has been adapted into two private dwellings. The gatehouse became a Grade II listed building on 15 August 1974. It is one of 24 buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail.

It was released as the second single from the album, atypically with another Entwistle song, \\"905\\" on the B-side, but did not chart. The lyrics describe fear of being sexually inadequate in the face of a prostitute. The singer wants to have an emotional connection with the prostitute but she only sees him as dehumanized and recognizes his sexual insecurity. He is concerned that he didn't bring her \\"to the height of ecstasy.\\" It features a guitar-like assault throughout the song, described by Pete Townshend as sounding like \\"a musical Mack truck\\" and is actually Entwistle's heavily distorted eight-string Alembic bass. Chris Charlesworth feels that the bass dominates the song to an extent that none of the other elements of the song matter. Billboard Magazine described the guitar riff as \\"furious\\" and \\"unrelenting,\\" and also praises drummer Keith Moon's ability to \\"[sustain] rhythmic tension.\\" Who biographer John Atkins says the song has a \\"muscular texture\\" and is \\"fully realized\\" but that it represents an \\"orthodox heavy rock format\\" that the band usually shunned. The Who FAQ author Mike Segretto considers it one of Entwistle's \\"catchier songs,\\" attributing its lack of chart success to its being \\"too heavy\\" and \\"too mean\\" for the 1977 singles chart. Segretto considers the song to be underrated, finding humor in the situation but stating that \\"genuine vulnerability makes the song more than a good giggle and undercuts the performance's cock-rock attitude.\\" But it was not a favorite of Who lead singer Roger Daltrey, who complained that it went \\"on and on and on and on.\\" It was performed occasionally on The Who's 1979 tour with Entwistle on eight-string and Townshend playing one of Entwistle's Alembic basses used on the 1975‚Äì1976 tours. It made its return to the setlist in 1989, with Townshend originally on electric guitar on the two Toronto dates in June and acoustic guitar for the rest of the tour. It was disliked by Roger Daltrey, who thought that although it had clever lyrics, it was too long.

Her police detective boyfriend Steve McBride (Barton MacLane) is investigating the case, but Torchy tags along as he hunts for the murder weapon. She finds a gun hidden in a drainpipe in the alley behind the store. Torchy also learns that Milton had a confrontation with Sonny Croy (Gordon Oliver). Croy is a reporter for the rival Star Telegram, and the son of the newspaper's owner, constantly in trouble over gambling debts and an outstanding loan. Sonny becomes a prime suspect, but he has an alibi from the victim's business partnerm Guy Allister (Joe King) that they were having lunch at the time of the murder. Torchy and Steve question the waiter in the restaurant and find a clue on a menu. They trace Sonny to the apartment of nightclub dancer Ila Sayre (Marcia Ralston) who insists that Sonny was on the phone with her at the time of the murder. Sonny explains the notes on the menu, saying that he is taking an aircraft and Zeppelin flight around the world as a publicity stunt. Torchy decides to follow him and talks her newspaper into sending her around the world in a race with Sonny and another reporter for the Daily Journal, Hughie Sprague (Hugh O'Connell). The journey ahead takes Torchy and her rivals across the Pacific, Asia, and Europe with stops at Honolulu, San Francisco, Hong Kong and Stuttgart, Germany. When the airship lands in Hawaii, Torchy searches Sonny's room and finds a message indicating that some items will be exchanged in Stuttgart. Sonny discovers her investigation after finding a lipstick Torchy accidentally dropped in his room. Later, Ila admits that she did not talk to Sonny on the phone. Steve, who has joined Torchy on board the airship, decides to arrest Sonny after Torchy points out that the back door of the restaurant is opposite to the back door of the jewelry store. Sonny, however, is found dead himself and it is discovered that the diamonds hidden in the false bottom of his suitcase are not real. Torchy puts the various clues together and determines that Guy Allister was the real murderer, and Sonny was working for him to pay off his debt. After further investigation, they learn that Allister boarded the airship using a false name. When he tries to parachute out of the airship, he falls to his death when his parachute fails to open.

Biography Life Born Anita Andr√©s December 12, 1930, in San Jose, California, to Alejandro Andr√©s from Salamanca, Spain, and Anita Dolgoff from Stavropol, Russia, Sleeman began taking piano lessons at age three and took up trumpet and French horn at school in San Francisco. While there, her music teachers noted her exceptional abilities at an early age (she began to show a talent for composition at age eight). Sleeman attended Placer Junior College as a music student. She met her future husband, Evan Sleeman, in Placer County and they married in 1951. They purchased a ranch in Elko County, Nevada, and along with their six children immigrated to Canada in 1963. They lived on a ranch in the remote Anahim Lake area near Bella Coola. In 1967, the couple relocated to Tsawwassen, Metropolitan Vancouver. Throughout her life she played the French horn in a variety of stage and concert bands and performed as a keyboardist in jazz ensembles. Career At age 19 Sleeman composed a march that was played at her community college's commencement in 1950 (the first public performance of her work). Sleeman taught music appreciation at the Anahim Lake elementary school. While in Anahim Lake she played piano and organ at many community gatherings. Sleeman resumed music studies at the University of British Columbia, earning a BMus in 1971, and MMus (on a graduate fellowship) in 1974. At UBC she was a pupil of Jean Coulthard and during that time she taught at the electronic music lab, co-founded the Delta Youth Orchestra, and was involved in the establishment of the music program at the Capilano College in North Vancouver as a member of its music faculty. She returned to California to complete her doctorate (1982) at the University of Southern California attending master classes with Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, and Charles Wuorinen. She also attended the Dick Grove School of Jazz. For 17 years she served as musical director and conductor of West Vancouver's Ambleside Orchestra, retiring in 2010. Her compositions have been premiered in London, England and Fiuggi, Italy as well as in Ottawa, Windsor and Vancouver; commissions include CBC Radio, Vancouver Community College, the Delta Youth Orchestra, the Galiano Trio, and others. At an early age Sleeman was introduced to the music of Olivier Messiaen, whose inspiration has been important in her development. Other influences are Var√®se, Stravinsky, Koechlin, L√≠geti, and Bart√≥k. Her diversity of style has also been enhanced by her Spanish and Russian background and her love of jazz. She admired the work of Frank Zappa, to whose memory she dedicated selected performances of her work. List of additional performances *February 1997: The Galiano Trio (flute, clarinet, bassoon) presented a concert of Sleeman's works, as part of the Little Chamber Series That Could season. This performance featured her Legend of the Lions and was enhanced by dance, and projected scene design by her daughter Cynthia Sleeman. *September 1997: Sleeman was selected to represent Canada at the Donna in Musica festival in Fiuggi, Italy. *September 1999: Picasso Gallery II was chosen for performance at the International Association of Women in Music Festival in London, England. *January 2002: Cantigas (commissioned by ACWC) was premiered in Ottawa by the Quatuor Arthur- Leblanc at the Then, Now and Beyond series sponsored jointly by Association of Canadian Women Composers and the Ottawa Chamber Music Society. The performance piece was repeated August 6, 2002, at the Ottawa Chamber Music Festival, again performed by the Quatuor Arthur-Leblanc, in the presence of Her Excellency the Governor-General Adrienne Clarkson. *July 2006: a new piece commissioned for the CBC, Rhapsody on Themes by Dohn√°nyi, was premiered in Ottawa, Ontario, at the Ottawa Chamber Music Festival, and performed again in 2007. Death Sleeman died early in the morning of October 18, 2011, at her home in North Vancouver, British Columbia. A memorial service for her was held on November 26, 2011, at St. Christopher's Anglican Church, West Vancouver. Critical reception Critic Ken Winters of The Globe and Mail praised Sleeman's work Cantigas as \\"remarkable\\", continuing, \\"It's as resourceful as Bart√≥k in exploiting string techniques and sound potentials, and just as vigorous musically.\\" See also *Music of Canada *List of Canadian composers *List of Canadian musicians References ;Citations Category:1930 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Musicians from San Jose, California Category:Thornton School of Music alumni Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:Canadian classical composers Category:Musicians from British Columbia Category:People from North Vancouver Category:Female classical composers Category:Capilano University faculty Category:21st-century American musicians Category:21st- century classical composers Category:20th-century Canadian composers Category:20th-century American musicians Category:20th-century American women musicians Category:21st-century American women musicians Category:20th-century Canadian conductors (music) Category:20th-century women composers Category:21st-century women composers ","title":"Anita Sleeman"},{"id":"34370814","text":"Sultank√∂y is a town in Tekirdaƒü Province, Turkey.

Born in Ottawa, Fuller joined the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1939 and was seconded to the British Royal Navy. During his service with the Royal Navy he commanded motor torpedo boat flotillas in European waters, serving with distinction in the Adriatic Sea where he earned a Distinguished Service Cross and two bars along with the nickname \\"Pirate of the Adriatic.\\" Following the war, Fuller commanded two Canadian Naval Reserve Divisions before retiring in 1952. Following his military service, Fuller ran Thomas Fuller Construction which was instrumental in the construction of several landmark buildings in Ottawa. He was also a member of Ottawa's Britannia Yacht Club and converted and built two brigantines that would later be used for sail training. Fuller died in Ottawa at the age of 85. Early life and naval service Born in Ottawa, he was a 32-year-old contractor when he joined the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1939. He was seconded to the British Royal Navy where he commanded flotillas of motor torpedo boats in the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic Sea. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) for an action off Dover on 12 May 1942 before being transferred to Alexandria and in 1943. While there he won a bar to his DSC for actions in the Aegean Sea. In 1944 he took command of the 61st MGB flotilla, eight torpedo gunboats, based on Vis Island, Yugoslavia. It was here, while conducting raids on Axis shipping to provide supplies to Josip Broz Tito's partisans, that he earned a second bar to his DSC and a Mention in Despatches, as well as the nickname \\"The Pirate of the Adriatic.\\" He was known as the Pirate of the Adriatic because he carried commandos and captured dozens of ships intact carrying useful cargo such as tons of goulash and Danish butter. For example, he sank or captured 25 ships in ten days. He had 105 firefights at sea as well as 30 actions in which he did not fire a shot. Nevertheless, he decommissioned 13 boats during his war service; the ships were no longer serviceable and were stripped for parts.Brown, pp. 118‚Äì122 After being imprisoned in Greece, he escaped in the German admiral's barge. After the war he commanded HMCS Naden and before retiring in 1952.Davies, pp. 140‚Äì142. Post war career Fuller ran Thomas Fuller Construction, which built the Ottawa Police Service headquarters, Ottawa General Hospital, Ottawa Congress Center, the Varette Building (1982) on Albert Street, and Standard Life's twin towers on Laurier Avenue. He was still working in the family business when he died at 85 years of age. Thomas Fuller converted a former tugboat into a brigantine, . In the 1980s, he designed and built a brigantine, , which was named in honour of his wife. After launching Fair Jeanne in 1982, he and his wife cruised around the world six and a half times.

As of 2012, Iron Stone has acquired and developed approximately $300 million in real estate related projects. Iron Stone was founded in 1995. The principals are Andrew Eisenstein, Jason Friedland, and Matthew Canno.  Urban Sustainability Iron Stone focuses on urban sustainability. Iron Stone focuses on the \\"adaptive reuse\\" of older buildings in densely populated, older city neighborhoods. By doing this, Iron Stone skips the wasteful demolition and reconstruction process. Furthermore, Iron Stone‚Äôs focus on real estate reuse does not contribute to the spread of urban sprawl.  Notable Projects  Falls Center Iron Stone is responsible for the redevelopment of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in East Falls, Philadelphia, which served as the first women's medical teaching hospital in the United States. Before Iron Stone acquired it, the hospital suffered from a number of rapid ownership changes and was finally abandoned in 2005 after the previous owner declared bankruptcy. The huge complex continued exacerbating urban blight in Philadelphia until Iron Stone was able to acquire it in 2006 and begin the process of adaptive reuse. In 2008, the principals registered the property in the National Register of Historic Places to honor its significance as the nation's first women's medical school. Falls Center Falls Center was originally constructed in the 1920s by Ritter & Shay, a prominent architecture firm in Philadelphia during the 1920s, and Iron Stone worked hard to preserve as much of the architectural elements as possible throughout the redevelopment process. The site has been successfully adapted for mixed-use student housing, commercial space and medical offices and has led to the creation of over 2,000 permanent full-time jobs. The Falls Center is home to over 18 businesses and is one of the largest centers of commerce in East Falls. Front of Falls Center Front of the Falls Center  1425 Arch St Iron Stone was responsible for the redevelopment of the long vacant Elkins Memorial YMCA, located at 1425 Arch St in Center City. This historic building was constructed in 1911 by the Gilded Age architect Horace Trumbauer. Using the existing floor plate as a guide, Iron Stone repositioned the former YMCA to house commercial office spaces, municipal operations, and a hotel with one of the only indoor pools in Center City. Street view of 1425 Arch Cooper Village Iron Stone was selected by Cooper Hospital, Rowan University and the City of Camden to buy the vacant land adjacent to the Cooper Medical School, and develop it as apartments for the medical students of Cooper Hospital. The mixed-use project, located along the 400 block of South Broadway, salvages blighted buildings and intersperses ground-up five story buildings. This development utilizes historic tax credits, NJ Economic Redevelopment and Growth tax credits (ERG), CDBG funds, and HMFA \\"A Better Camden\\" funds. Cooper Village Special Victims Unit The City of Philadelphia chose Iron Stone to design and develop a state of the art co-location facility for the Philadelphia Police Department's Special Victims Unit (SVU), the Department of Human Services (DHS) Sexual Abuse Investigations Unit, the Philadelphia Children's Alliance, and offices for the staff of the District Attorney. Located in Hunting Park, Philadelphia, Iron Stone used the existing envelope of a former truck terminal as the base of the development and subsequently added 10,000 square feet of new construction to complete the Warehouse Conversion to Office Space.

It is located in the Al Fahidi Fort (), built in 1787 and is the oldest existing building in Dubai. The museum was opened by the Ruler of Dubai in 1971, with the aim of presenting the traditional way of life in the Emirate of Dubai. When entering, one can see the fort constructed and the various displays that go along with it. From the fort, there is a path to the galleries, which display the general culture of the land, especially in the 1800s. It includes local antiques as well as artifacts from African and Asian countries that traded with Dubai. It also includes several dioramas showing life in the emirate before the advent of oil, in addition to artifacts from recent discoveries as old as 3000 BC. In 2007, Dubai Museum received 1,800 visitors daily, with a yearly total of 611,840. In March 2008, the Museum had 80,000 visitors. The most popular times are from August to April. The Museum received over 1 million visitors in the year 2013. The total area of Dubai museum is 4,000 square meters. History Al Fahidi Fort circa 1959 Al Fahidi Fort was built in several phases. The oldest tower was built around 1787, and is believed to be the oldest building in Dubai that still exists today. The fort was used to guard the landward approaches to the town from the raids of neither ruler's palace, a garrison, and a prison.Gulf News Dubai Museum AL Fahidi Fort: Dubai Police In 1969 Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum issued a letter to Sheikh Badr Mohammad Al Sabah, head of the office of state in Kuwait, asking for a museum expert to be sent to Dubai to help establish the museum. Fort Al Fahidi Fort is square-shaped with towers occupying three of its corners. It was built of coral rock and mortar in several phases. Just off the southern wall lie a reconstruction of the old city walls. Next to them stands a tall dhow (traditional boat) in the middle of a large courtyard that covers the underground galleries. Two cannons guard the main gate to the fort on the eastern wall, adorned by flags of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. Internal halls line three of the fort walls. One hall is at the main gate and houses the ticket office, while the others contain a collection of old weapons and arms from different historical periods along with a model of the city in 1820 AD. Traditional musical instruments are also displayed next to a video of folkloric music. The halls surround a central courtyard. Here you will find a bronze cannon with cannonballs, a well, and various types of boats. In the corner stands a traditional summer house called Arish. The Arish is made entirely from weaved palm fronds. It comprises seating and sleeping areas as well as a kitchen, filled with household furnishings and objects used by the locals in past times. The Arish features the distinct wind tower design, used for air conditioning in the pre-electricity days.

After descending the spiral stairs visitors enter the first gallery, where old maps of Dubai are displayed. Next is the video room, showing a video, updated in 2007, that depicts Dubai from before the discovery of oil in the 1960s to the current day. Below it there is a map that shows the urban scape of the city growing in sync with the timeline of the video. Life-size dioramas of the pre-oil era await behind the next door. Once they enter, visitors will set foot on the deck of a dhow unloading at the model creek-side souq. Moving ahead they will see the shops filled with craftsmen, vendors and buyers. A tailor, a carpenter, an iron smith, a textile vendor and others line the street. Realistic sounds and life-size videos of craftsmen at work give the impression of a bustling souq. The street leads to a model of a mosque, house and family, then turns to the right where it is surrounded by depictions of desert life with a date farm, a camel, wild animals, and a Bedouin tent filled with jewelry, trinkets and objects from the daily life of Bedouins. The walls tell about their knowledge of the stars and how they used it to guide their activities. Next is the largest diorama which is all about the sea, with a huge scene of the building of a dhow, scenes of marine life detailing local species, in addition to a collection of seafaring equipment. The last diorama features an archaeological site in Al Qusais area that goes back to 3000 BC. There are tombs, an excavated skeleton, and an archaeologist. All the way sounds, visual effects and electronic guides accompany the dioramas. Cabinets filled with archaeological finds from Al Qusais site line the walls next to the excavation scene. Finally, the winding track leads to a gallery displaying finds from other sites and historical eras, like the Umayyad site at Jumeirah. The gift shop is the last stop before a spiral ramp takes you up to the museum's southern exit.

Here, one of Maggie's society friends enlists her help in getting an undesirable tenant evicted, a tenant who turns out to be Jiggs himself. Meanwhile Jiggs rounds up his friends from the bar to defend his turf. McManus briefly appears here as himself. This 1946 production is subsequent to a number of previous Maggie and Jiggs movies, both animated and live-action, notably a silent 1928 Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer film directed by Jack Conway. This one was successful enough to inspire four more Monogram sequels: * Jiggs and Maggie in Society (1948) * Jiggs and Maggie in Court (1948) * Jiggs and Maggie in Jackpot Jitters (1949) * Jiggs and Maggie Out West (1950) All five of these featured former vaudevillian Joe Yule (father of Mickey Rooney) as Jiggs, and were his final films.

Development The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt was first formed in 1921. It was, and is, a group of aeronautical students who design and construct aircraft as part of their studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. One of the first of these students was the son of a Privy Councillor () and the group's sixth design, the D-6, was named in his honour. The Geheimrat was a wood framed aircraft with a rectangular cross section, flat sided, plywood covered fuselage. In plan it tapered only slightly but the depth decreased rapidly towards the tail, making the fuselage behind the wing strongly wedge shaped. The wing was mounted on two extensions at the highest point, with an open, unscreened cockpit below its leading edge behind a more rounded nose. A pair short skids attached directly to the edges of the fuselage underside acted as the undercarriage, aided by a short tailskid at the rear. The thick section wing was a cantilever structure with ply covering from the spar to the leading edge and fabric covered aft. The centre section, about half the total span, was straight edged and with a constant 1.41 m (4 ft 7.5 in) chord. The outer panels were straight tapered, mostly on the trailing edge which carried the roll control surfaces. Unusually, the pilot did not alter pitch with elevators but by varying the angle of incidence in flight. The contemporary Harth- Messerschmitt S.10 glider used the same method. As a result, the fabric covered, rectangular tailplane, mounted by its leading edge at the extreme tail, was without elevators. The similarly covered fin and rudder together almost formed a square, its trailing edge over the tailplane's front spar. Operational history The D-6 Geheimrat first flew in 1922 and competed in the Rh√∂n (Wasserkuppe) glider meeting that August. It gained second place in the sink rate section, though overall a contemporary observer judged the earlier Darmstadt D-4 Edith, a braced monoplane, more successful. Having seen the Akaflieg Hannover Vampyr slope soaring for up to three hours, the Darmstadt students were soon making similar long flights in both their aircraft.

His work as Technical Director of the Decca Record Company Ltd. caused him to be nicknamed \\"the father of hi-fi\\". After working in the recording industry in the 1930s, Haddy was employed in wartime projects during the Second World War. These required new, sophisticated sonic developments that Haddy and his colleagues later put to peacetime use in Decca's innovative postwar recording techniques. He was an early proponent of the long-playing record, stereophony, video discs and digital recording. Biography Early years Haddy was born in Newbury, Berkshire, and educated locally at St. Bartholomew's Grammar School. He became an apprentice with the radio equipment manufacturers C. F. Elwell Ltd, and moved to the Western Electric Company as a junior employee.Humphreys, Ivor \\"Arthur Charles Haddy (1906-1989) An Appreciation\\", Gramophone, April 1990, p. 163 In 1929, he became engaged to the daughter of Harry Fay, a popular singer who recorded with the Crystalate Company, makers of the Rex and Panachord labels. Haddy attended one of Fay's recording sessions, and, as he later recalled: > I was amazed at the primitive equipment they had installed. I commented that > I could build something better than that on the kitchen table. About six > months later I had a call from the company's managing director asking if my > remark could be taken seriously. I said that it had been meant as a joke but > none the less I would have a go. I built a set of amplifiers and cutting > head for them on the strength of which I was asked to join the firm.Blyth, > Alan, Arthur Haddy, F.I.E.R.E, The Gramophone, April 1971, p. 44 Haddy was reluctant to leave Western Electric, but Crystalate offered him twice his existing salary, and his fianc√©e insisted on his accepting the offer.Haddy, Arthur, Recorded reminiscences, Sound Recording History, Archival Sound Recordings, British Library, accessed 21 December 2010 Together with a music director, Jay Wilbur, Haddy was in sole charge of the technical side of the company's work until the young Kenneth Wilkinson joined him in 1931. Although the company was based at Tonbridge in Kent, Crystalate made many of its recordings at the acoustically excellent town hall of West Hampstead in north west London. At first the company rented the hall, and was later able to buy the freehold for ¬£1,250. During the 1930s Haddy gradually developed improved cutting heads and dynamic pickups, with the aim of widening the usable frequency range of his records. At that time, recordings were cut directly on wax, and the existing cutting heads were restricted to a bandwidth of about 50-8,000Hz. After experimenting with other techniques, Haddy opted for the moving-coil principle which Paul Voigt of Edison Bell and Alan Blumlein of EMI had separately advocated back in the 1920s. His first efforts were restricted to a 7,500Hz upper limit but the sound quality was nonetheless much improved. The repertoire recorded by Haddy for Crystalate was mainly light music and comedy records, with artists such as Sandy Powell, Charles Penrose, and Leslie Sarony. Decca In 1937, the Decca Record Company took over Crystalate. Haddy and Wilkinson joined the Decca staff. When World War II broke out in 1939, Haddy and his team were moved from making commercial recordings to developing vital technology for the war effort. They were tasked with making recording equipment to detect the sonic differences in the water movement around German and British submarine propellers. As the relevant sonic differences were at the high end of the frequency range, unprecedently sensitive equipment had to be invented. Haddy managed to meet the requirement by doubling the response of his recording cutter head to 15,000Hz. This was not only an important contribution to the war effort, but made possible greatly enhanced gramophone recordings when the war ended. \\"We'd got the goods,\\" Haddy later recalled. His exploitation of the greatly enhanced frequency range was the basis of Decca's famous \\"ffrr\\" ‚Äì full frequency range recordings. So significant were his developments that his original ffrr cutting head is on permanent display in the Science Museum in London. In the early years of ffrr, Haddy engineered many Decca recordings, but from the early 1950s onward he delegated studio work to his colleagues, including Wilkinson, Cyril Windebank, Roy Wallace, and later a new generation of engineers such as Gordon Parry.Stuart, Philip. Decca Classical, 1929-2009 accessed 10 January 2012. By the end of the decade Decca's technical team was recognised as the best in the industry; The Times spoke of \\"Decca's incomparable engineers\\".\\"The G√∂tterd√§mmerung everyone has been waiting for\\", The Times, 8 May 1965, p. 5 Under Haddy's technical leadership, Decca was the first British company to issue long playing records (1950) and was in the vanguard of stereophony in the middle of the decade. He was also a pioneer of the video disc at the end of the 1960s, which did not succeed commercially, and of digital recording, which quickly became the industry standard. Of his work on the latter, Ivor Humphreys wrote in Gramophone: When the Decca Group was taken over by Polygram in 1980, Haddy, like his old colleague Wilkinson, retired. He died at the age of 83.

Sommer represents the 106th (formally the 15th District) District which encompasses portions of St. Charles County, Missouri. She was first elected to the Missouri House in a special election on November 8, 2011 to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Sally Faith. Early life, education and career Chrissy Sommer was born in Kirkwood, Missouri. After graduation from Lindbergh High School in 1984 Sommer earned an associate degree in Business Administration from St. Louis Community College. She then furthered her education at the University of Missouri - St. Louis, receiving a bachelor's degree in Business Administration and Business Marketing in 1989. Prior to entering politics Sommer worked for her family business, Sunset Maintenance Company. She now helps run her husband's CPA firm, Sommer & Associates CPAs LLC and manage a commercial multi-tenant building. She and husband Michael Sommer are the parents of two children. Politics In April 2011 Sally Faith, the sitting 15th District Representative, won election as mayor of St. Charles, Missouri and resigned from her House seat. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon then called for a special election to fill the remainder of Faiths' term. Chrissy Sommer had been previously involved in local Republican politics, serving in the St. Charles County Republican Central Committee. She was selected by Committee members of the 15th District from three potential Republican candidates to face Democrat Paul Woody and Libertarian Bill Slantz. In a very close election held on November 8, 2011, Sommer edged Woody by only 38 votes. Due to the small margin, Woody asked for a recount and Sommer was declared the winner in a recount conducted on December 14, 2011. The Missouri Secretary of State's office certified that the recount gave Sommer an additional two votes over Democrat Paul Woody for a total of forty votes difference. After the 2010 U.S. Census, all of Missouri's House and Senate districts were redrawn. Effective January 2013 Sommer's home of record will be in the 106th district, which she again ran for and won in the 2014 midterm.

Model of Herod's Jerusalem Palace-Fortress in the northwest corner of the Upper City walls. The three towers, from L to R, are Phasael, Hippicus, and Mariamne. Just beneath the latter two, a portion of the reconstruction of the palace building itself is visible. Herod's Palace at Jerusalem was built in the last quarter of the 1st century BC by Herod I the Great, King of Judea from 37 BC to 4 BC. It was the second most important building in Jerusalem, after the Temple itself, in Herod‚Äôs day and was situated at the northwestern wall of the Upper City of Jerusalem (the Western Hill abandoned after the Babylonian sacking of Jerusalem). Herod lived in it as a principal residence, but not permanently, as he owned other palace-fortresses, notably at Masada, Herodium and Caesarea Maritima. Nothing remains of the Jerusalem Palace today except for portions of the surrounding wall-and-tower complex, much altered and generally known as \\"the Citadel\\" (see Tower of David). The site of the former palace is now occupied by the Tower of David Museum, a police station, and a former Turkish barracks/prison known as the Kishle. Location and associated structures The \\"Tower of David\\"‚Äîseen here from the inner courtyard of the Citadel‚Äîwas built on the base of the Tower of Hippicus. Herod's palace- fortress in Jerusalem stood along the western city wall, in the area now taken by the Armenian Quarter, starting in the north at the Kishle building and ending at the present line of the modern (Ottoman period) wall west of Zion Gate. It consisted mainly of two palace wings placed north and south of a large garden. Immediately north of the complex, in the area of today's Citadel and Jaffa Gate, Herod erected three huge towers, as an additional protection and last refuge in case of danger. These he called after people close to him - Hippicus after a friend, Phasael after his brother, and Mariamne after his favourite wife. These towers strengthened the northwest corner of the First Wall, the city wall built by the Hasmoneans sometime between 152-134 BC. Of the three towers, only the massive lower part of the Hippicus Tower (or the Phasael Tower, according to some researchers) have survived. Remains of two older, Hasmonean towers (the Southern and Middle Towers) have been found in the present Citadel courtyard, which are unrelated to the missing Herodian towers. During the Byzantine period, the tower, and by extension the Citadel as a whole, acquired its alternative name - the Tower of David - after the Byzantines, mistakenly identifying the hill as Mount Zion, presumed it to be David's palace. This name is still in use today, although in the 19th century an Ottoman minaret erected between 1635-65 over the southern wall of the Citadel took over the title of \\"Tower of David\\", so that the name can now refer to either the whole Citadel or the minaret alone. Description As with his Temple, Herod's Jerusalem Palace was constructed on an elevated platform of about 1,000 feet (north-south) by 180 feet (east-west). Resting on a series of retaining walls rising 13 to 16 feet above ground level. It consisted of two main buildings, each with its own banquet halls, baths, and accommodations for hundreds of guests. The two wings were named after Agrippa and Caesar. In the center of the palace were gardens with porticoes. The grounds included groves, canals, and ponds fitted with bronze fountains. The praetorium at the Palace was, after Herod's death, the official residence of the Roman governors when they came to Jerusalem during major Jewish festivals. This was probably the site of the trial of Jesus of Nazareth by Pontius Pilate (see Pilate's court). To the north of Herod's Palace were the three immense towers, * The Phasael Tower was the largest. It was named after Herod's brother and stood 145 feet high. * The Hippicus Tower was named after a friend of Herod and stood 132 feet high. * The Mariamne Tower was named after Herod‚Äôs Hasmonean wife whom he had executed. Josephus said that \\"the king considering it appropriate that the tower named after a woman should surpass in decoration those called after men.\\" It stood 74 feet high and was accounted the most beautiful of the three. Josephus‚Äô description The ancient writer and historian Josephus vividly described the \\"wondrous\\" palace in The Wars of the Jews (ca. 75 AD). Book 5, chapter 4 tells that > The largeness also of the stones was wonderful; for they were not made of > common small stones, nor of such large ones only as men could carry, but > they were of white marble, cut out of the rock; each stone was twenty cubits > in length, and ten in breadth, and five in depth. They were so exactly > united to one another, that each tower looked like one entire rock of stone, > so growing naturally, and afterward cut by the hand of the artificers into > their present shape and corners; so little, or not at all, did their joints > or connexion appear low as these towers were themselves on the north side of > the wall, the king had a palace inwardly thereto adjoined, which exceeds all > my ability to describe it; for it was so very curious as to want no cost nor > skill in its construction, but was entirely walled about to the height of > thirty cubits, and was adorned with towers at equal distances, and with > large bed-chambers, that would contain beds for a hundred guests a-piece, in > which the variety of the stones is not to be expressed; for a large quantity > of those that were rare of that kind was collected together. Their roofs > were also wonderful, both for the length of the beams, and the splendor of > their ornaments. The number of the rooms was also very great, and the > variety of the figures that were about them was prodigious; their furniture > was complete, and the greatest part of the vessels that were put in them was > of silver and gold. There were besides many porticoes, one beyond another, > round about, and in each of those porticoes curious pillars; yet were all > the courts that were exposed to the air everywhere green. There were, > moreover, several groves of trees, and long walks through them, with deep > canals, and cisterns, that in several parts were filled with brazen statues, > through which the water ran out. There were withal many dove-courts of tame > pigeons about the canals. But indeed it is not possible to give a complete > description of these palaces; and the very remembrance of them is a torment > to one, as putting one in mind what vastly rich buildings that fire which > was kindled by the robbers hath consumed; for these were not burnt by the > Romans, but by these internal plotters, as we have already related, in the > beginning of their rebellion. That fire began at the tower of Antonia, and > went on to the palaces, and consumed the upper parts of the three towers > themselves.Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews, or History of the > Destruction of Jerusalem, trans. William Whiston, Book V, Chapt. 4, Verse 4. Fate of the Palace At the creation of the Roman province of Judaea in the year 6 CE, its governors‚Äîholding the rank of a prefect until the year 41 and that of a procurator after that‚Äîtook up residence in Herod's palace. In 66 CE, the Roman governor Gessius Florus set up a mass crucifixion of Jews, sparking the First Jewish Rebellion. Rebelling Jews entered and burnt the palace. Only the three towers remained partially standing. When the future Roman emperor Titus destroyed most of Jerusalem in 70 CE, he spared these and set up the camp of the Tenth Legion Fretensis in the area of the palace ruins, a camp which covered the entire Western Hill. One of the towers‚Äîa rebuilt Hippicus (or Phasael) Tower on its intact base‚Äîbecame known as the \\"Tower of David\\". This was due to the fact that during the Byzantine Period, the Western Hill had been mistakenly identified as Mount Zion and the remains of the one surviving Herodian tower were presumed to be King David's palace. Evidence shows that Crusaders fortified and heightened the 15 foot thick Hasmonean city wall and that Arabs, who conquered Jerusalem in 637, did the same. During the 1160s the kings of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem built in the same general area a royal palace of their own, of which close to nothing remains.Adrian J. Boas. Jerusalem in the Time of the Crusades: Society, Landscape and Art in the Holy City under Frankish Rule. Pages 79-82. Routledge 2009. . David Eisenstadt. Jerusalem in the Crusader Period. Bar-Ilan University, Internet Educational Activities, 1997. \\"Adjoining the Citadel to the south was the royal palace of the Crusader kings.\\" A 19th-century Egyptian barracks and later prison‚Äîlocally known as the Kishle‚Äîwas built adjacent to the Citadel's southern moat and was used, successively, by Ibrahim Pasha's troops (1834-40/41), the Turks (1840/41-1917), the British (1917‚Äì48), the Jordanians (1948‚Äì67) and in parts by the Israeli police after 1967. The very popular Tower of David Museum, located at the Citadel, is also administering the Kishle building, thus covering the northernmost part of the palace. 20th and 21st century excavations In the 1970s, excavations outside the city wall disclosed the exit of a water drain belonging to Herod's Palace. This culvert transported water from the palace into the Hinnom Valley. Until recently, no portion of Herod's palace proper‚Äîexcluding, that is, the surrounding walls- and-towers complex‚Äîhad ever been uncovered. In 2001, however, excavations disclosed two palace walls, constructed of the easily recognizable Herodian hewn giant blocks.Schaalje, Jacqueline (2001), \\"Israeli Archaeologists Discover Herod's Palace\\", The Jewish Magazine (October 2001). Even these probably did not belong to the palace proper, but were part of the retaining walls for its base, a construction similar to that used by Herod at the Temple Mount. Excavations by Ruth Amiran and Avraham Eitan have also revealed some parts of the superstructure which included sections of painted plaster.

Corporate history Protalix BioTherapeutics was established in 1993.Investor FAQ It was founded by Yoseph Shaaltiel, who received his Ph.D. in Plant Biochemistry from the Weizmann Institute in Israel and served in the Biology Department of the Israel Defense Forces' Biological and Chemical Center. One of the earliest and largest investors in the company was Phillip Frost. Protalix has two Nobel Prize winners (Chemistry) in its Scientific Advisory Board, Roger Kornberg Ph.D and Prof. MD. Aaron Ciechanover. In its early days Protalix operated out of a warehouse in the town of Qiryat Shemona in northern Israel. On July 19, 2005, Protalix Biotherapeutics announced the closing of a $5.3 million private placement of its series C preferred stock. Protalix entered into a partnership agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 2006 for the development of two proteins and in 2009 signed a collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of its taliglucerase alfa treatment. Also in 2009, Protalix reported that Frost & Sullivan presented the company with its 2009 European Orphan Diseases Market Product Innovation of the Year Award. In 2011 Protalix announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the company's manufacturing facility in Karmiel. Protalix initially became a public company through a reverse merger process with Orthodontix, a company which was at the time traded \\"over the counter\\" on the NASDAQ. This merger was completed on December 31, 2006, and is notable as one of the largest reverse mergers executed, valuing the joint entity at almost $1 billion. It subsequently applied for a listing on the AMEX, and sold 10 million shares in a public offering. Products Protalix has been using cultured plant cells to manufacture biopharmaceuticals. As of 2017, Protalix has one FDA approved product sold by Pfizer in the U.S. and currently developing four products: * Taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) ‚Äì a recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme produced from transgenic carrot cell cultures. Known also as Elelyso, taliglucerase won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2012 as an orphan drug for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher's disease. Protalix has licensed global development and commercialization rights for Elelyso to Pfizer, except for Brazil, where Protalix retains full rights. Brazil has the third largest number of Gaucher patients identified worldwide, after the U.S. and Israel. The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, known as ANVISA, granted regulatory approval for Elelyso (Uplyso) to treat adults with Gaucher disease in March 2013, and extended that approval to children in December 2016. * Alidornase alfa (PRX-110) ‚Äì proprietary plant cell-expressed recombinant form of human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), that Protalix has designed, through chemical modification, to be resistant to inhibition by actin. DNase I is part of current Cystic Fibrosis therapy, intended to reduce sputum viscosity that accumulates in the lungs of Cystic Fibrosis patients, which exposes patients to recurrent infections and compromises lung function. AIR DNase (alidornase alfa), developed to make mucus in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients less sticky, showed remarkably good results in 2017. Alidornasa alfa is being developed to treat all cystic fibrosis patients and expected to replace Pulmozyme¬Æ in 2020. * Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) ‚Äì plant cell culture expressed and a chemically modified version of the recombinant alpha- Galactosidase-A protein. Protein sub-units are covalently bound via chemical cross-linking using PEG chains, resulting in a more active and stable molecule than the current available versions. Protalix is currently conducting Phase 3 clinical trial for PRX-102 for the treatment of Fabry Disease following a successful meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Protalix announced positive results from its clicnical trial for PRX-102. Pegunigalsidase alfa is being developed to replace Fabrazyme and interim data shows potential superiority in efficacy. * OPRX-106 ‚Äì plant cell-expressed recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor II fused to an IgG1 Fc domain (TNFRII-Fc), in development for oral administration. If successful, OPRX-106 will be the first ever oral enzyme treatment as currently there are no other oral enzyme treatments available. * PRX-105 ‚Äì a recombinant human Acetylcholinesterase, produced from genetically modified cell line of tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum), which can be used as a counter-measure against nerve agents attack.

The club has also a women's rugby team competing in \\"Torneo Femenino\\", organised by the same body. Centro Naval has also a field hockey team affiliated to Buenos Aires Hockey Association.Gu√≠a de Clubes, AHBA website Other sports that can be practised at Centro Naval are fencing, football, gymnastics, karate, swimming, taekwondo, tennis and yachting.Sede Olivos at official web History Rugby began to be played at the Escuela Naval of R√≠o Santiago (where Liceo Naval Militar was located) by a group of cadets. They used a ball which had been given to them by the crew of an English ship some weeks ago. Although the cadets were enthusiasts, they did not know the rules, so their first teacher was Mr. Hume, who had British ancestors and worked at R√≠o Santiago navy base, apart from being member of Belgrano Athletic Club. During the 1930 and 1940 decades, the Escuela Naval played some friendly matches against relevant teams such as CASI, CUBA, Olivos, Universitario (LP), and Belgrano Athletic. In 1950 the team began to participate in the defense forces tournaments of Argentina, where the Army, Air Force and Navy teams took part. In 1953 Escuela Naval affiliated to Argentine Rugby Union, although the team did not participate in official matches for many years. In 1980 the Uni√≥n de Rugby de Buenos Aires (URBA) demanded the club to have a field where rugby games could be disputed, as a request to affiliate to the Federation. For that reason a field began to be built in N√∫√±ez, Buenos Aires, where the team would play its home games. In the navy base of Puerto Belgrano, a group of officers that had played for Escuela Naval, founded their own team, Club de Rugby Puerto Belgrano, in 1963. The team became a member of Uni√≥n de Rugby del Sur (Southern Rugby Union) In 1988 some internal problems force to find a solution to continue with the practise of rugby. The objective was to create a new rugby club where not only the members of the army were included but civilians too. The location chosen was the N√∫√±ez district of Buenos Aires. Due to the former denomination Escuela Naval could not be used. In 1989 Centro Naval affiliated to Uni√≥n de Rugby de Buenos Aires as a guest member, being supported by clubs Belgrano Athletic and Don Bosco.Centro Naval rugby brochure Facilities The \\"Sede Central\\" building on Florida and C√≥rdoba, Buenos Aires The club currently has four facilities in the Buenos Aires Province.

It recounts the journeys of Awa, a lesbian Moor necromancer, through an irreverently portrayed 16th-century Europe, helped by friends who include historical figures such as the polymath Paracelsus and the artist-mercenary Niklaus Manuel.  Synopsis The story follows the life of Awa, a lesbian Moor slave girl, who is captured near early 16th-century Granada by a powerful necromancer. After several years of tormented apprenticeship, Awa finally manages to kill the necromancer, only for her to discover this to be a key element of the necromancer's plan to reincarnate himself in her young body after a decade has passed. Leaving Andalusia on a search for the necromancer's grimoire, she is caught on the order of the overzealous inquisitor Kahlert manipulated by a shadow from her past, her undead ex-lover Omorose. Rather luckily, she is freed by artist-turned- mercenary Niklaus Manuel Deutsch of Bern, with whom she strikes up an improbable friendship, soon followed by further friends in the form of polymath Paracelsus and the lesbian weaponsmith Monique. Though Awa settles down in Monique's brothel in Paris for a while, making good use of her magical healing talents and falling in love with the plucky prostitute Chlo√©, her impending doom makes her resume her search for the necromancer's grimoire. Further encounters with Kahlert and Omorose and a sect of vampires in the Schwarzwald as well as Chlo√©'s death bring her close to desperation. Shortly before running out of time, however, she - with help from Manuel, Monique and Paracelsus - manages to turn the spirits of the casualties of the Battle of Bicocca against the necromancer's spirit, banishing him forever and thereby escaping his curse.  Reception The novel was well received by critics. The A.V. Club praised it as \\"beautifully balancing putridity, profanity, and poignancy\\", and Publishers Weekly appreciated its \\"relentless dark humor blended with occasional tragedy\\". The Wall Street Journal's reviewer characterized the novel as \\"macabre, gruesome, foul-mouthed and much more complex than the usual vampire-and-zombie routine\\". In January 2012, it was named a finalist for the 2011 Kitschies Red Tentacle award.

The pilots were required by law to maintain a constant round the clock watch with enough pilots aboard a pilot boat on the bar to pilot any arriving ship safely into port. In 1910 the motor boat California was built for the pilots. In 1935 three schooner pilot vessels were maintained to provide rotating five-day watches on the bar near the lightship with two, the large schooner California and Gracie S. being regulars with Adventuress as reserve. At that time the pilot vessels were crewed by seven men hosting up to ten pilots awaiting ships with a rule that at sunset enough should be aboard to pilot all vessels expected before noon of the next day.

For seven years the classes were based in Mickleham Hall, which was rented in Dorking. In 1937, the school moved to its current site, located in Little Bookham; the Queen Anne House was built in 1710 but had been empty for a long time.

It was constructed in the years 1837‚Äì39 as the centrepiece of a redevelopment of part of Monmouth town centre. After being severely damaged by fire in 1963, it was partly rebuilt and is now the home of Monmouth Museum (formerly the Nelson Museum). At the rear of the building are original slaughterhouses, called The Shambles, opening onto the River Monnow. The building is Grade II listed as at 27 June 1952, and it is one of 24 buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. The Shambles slaughterhouses are separately listed as Grade II*. Original building and associated development By the 1830s, the main road into the centre of Monmouth from the north, Church Street, had become increasingly congested and insalubrious. The street was narrow, and was used by most of the town's butchers. According to local tradition, a local gingerbread maker, Mrs Syner, was closing the shutters of her shop on Church Street one evening when the mail coach to Liverpool went through at a gallop. Her apron strings were caught in one of the horses' harnesses, and she was dragged along the ground for some distance. Escaping serious injury, she grabbed the coachman's whip, knocked out some of his teeth with the handle, and marched back to her shop to begin organising a petition for a new road to be built to bypass Church Street. The Borough Council then organised a competition for the best scheme, with a prize of ¬£10 for the winner. The scheme also needed to include a new Market Hall, as the traditional site of the town's produce market, beneath the arches of the Shire Hall, faced disruption because of the need to extend the accommodation for the Assizes.Keith Kissack, Monmouth and its Buildings, Logaston Press, 2003, , p.xiiMonmouth Civic Society, Guide to the Monmouth Heritage Blue Plaque Trail, n.d., p.10 The arcade of slaughterhouses (or Shambles) beneath the Market Hall, above the River Monnow, with the modern museum extension above The prize was won by local architect George Vaughan Maddox, who proposed a new road running to the west of the town centre, immediately above the bank of the River Monnow. Maddox's scheme was for a carriage road‚Äînow Priory Street‚Äîsupported by a viaduct built upon the river bank. A new Market Hall was to be built on one side of the road, supported by the arches. The town's slaughterhouses or \\"shambles\\" would be sited beneath the arches, and the waste from them would drain directly into the river. Maddox is also believed to have been responsible for new buildings on the opposite side of Priory Street. Work began on the new road in 1834. Construction of the New Market Hall started in 1837, and it opened in January 1840. Maddox designed a crescent-shaped frontage, in a \\"grandiose and scholarly Greek Doric\\" style,John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , pp.405‚Äì406 with an Ionic cupola and clerestory above the central part of the building, the whole being constructed of Bath Stone. The town's Post Office was located in the building from 1874 and, after 1876, the first floor of the building was used as the offices and printing works of the local newspaper, the Monmouthshire Beacon. The curved arcade of slaughterhouses beneath the Market Hall, facing onto the river, was built of Old Red Sandstone. The piers of the 24 arches were slightly inclined to give additional stability. The arches opened into deep storage rooms, vaulted in brick. The Shambles have an independent Grade II* listing. Fire and later uses In March 1963, the entire central part of the Market Hall building was destroyed by a fire which started in the newspaper's paper store, on the first floor. Gathering the Jewels: The New Market Hall fire, Monmouth, 1963, accessed October 2013 The Borough Council, on the casting vote of Monmouth's mayor, decided that the building should be restored rather than demolished to provide space for car parking, although lack of funds meant that the upper storey and clock tower could not be replaced. A new flat roof for the single storey building, together with a Modernist metal and glass fa√ßade at the rear, overlooking the Monnow, were provided in 1968‚Äì69 by architects Donald Insall Associates. Six years after the fire the restored Market Hall opened to house the Nelson Museum and the post office. It was intended that the library would also move in but that remained at the Shire Hall. Apart from the museum‚Äînow the Monmouth Museum‚Äîand post office, the remaining parts of the building have at various times housed the county court, a labour exchange, Monmouthshire County Council offices, and a caf√©. The slaughterhouses, which are visible from the railings behind the southern end of the Market Hall, remain physically intact but are disused, dilapidated, and increasingly vandalised. Many of the original slaughterhouse fittings remain in place. Various schemes have been put forward to re-use the slaughterhouses, without success. A feasibility project to investigate the site's potential was proposed by the County Council in 2009.

Painted in 1493, it is the earliest of D√ºrer's painted self-portraits and has been identified as one of the first self-portraits painted by a Northern artist.Feny≈ë, Iv√°n (1956). Albrecht D√ºrer. Budapest: Corvina. p. 16. It was acquired in 1922 by the Louvre in Paris. D√ºrer looks out at the viewer with a psychologically complex but rather melancholy and reserved, serious minded, facial expression. During the 15th century, thistles were symbols of male conjugal fidelity.Brion (1960), p. 127 History In 1493, D√ºrer was 22 years old and working in Strasbourg. He had completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut and his tour as a journeyman, and would marry Agnes Frey on 7 July 1494. The date and the plant in the artist's hand seem to suggest that this is a betrothal portrait (Brautportr√§t). D√ºrer has in fact depicted himself in the act of offering a flowering spray identified by botanists as eryngium amethystinum: its German name is \\"Mannestreue\\", meaning conjugal fidelity. Resembling the thistle (from which the portrait's title), this umbelliferous plant is used in medicine, and is regarded as an aphrodisiac.Botanical herbal note on the eryngium, on Botanical.com. Accessed 13 January 2012 It may also have religious significance; the same plant in outline form is inscribed in the gold ground of D√ºrer's painting Christ as the Man of Sorrows (1493‚Äì94).Wolf (2006), p. 28. D√ºrer was temperamentally inclined to philosophical doubts. He often analysed his own face in drawn or painted effigies ‚Äì sometimes idealizing it, sometimes not. The lines written beside the date in this painting reveal the philosophical and Christian intention of the work: :: > Myj sach die gat > Als es oben schtat. In other words (and liberally): My affairs follow the course allotted to them on high. Marriage has in part determined his destiny ‚Äì the Bridegroom puts his future life in the hands of God.J.L. Koerner, The Moment of Self-portraiture in German Renaissance Art, University of Chicago Press (1997).

According to Lawrence Gowing, who calls this \\"the most French of all his pictures\\", the Portrait of the Artist Holding a Thistle is singular among D√ºrer's paintings as \\"the touch is freer and color more iridescent than in any other picture one remembers\\".Gowing (1987), p. 164 References Sources * Brion, Marcel.

Herod the Great commissioned a lavish palace to be built between 23 and 15 BCE atop Herodium for all to see. The palace itself consisted of four towers of seven stories, a bathhouse, courtyards, a Roman theatre, banquet rooms, a large walkway (‚Äúthe course‚Äù), as well as extravagant living quarters for himself and guests. Once Herod died and the Great Revolt started, Herodium was abandoned. The Jews eventually had a base at Herodium where they built a synagogue which can still be seen today, unlike much of Herod‚Äôs Palace. Construction Archaeologists believe that the palace was built by slaves, paid workers (contractors), and architects. Herod was considered one of the greatest builders of his time, and geography did not daunt him‚Äîhis palace was built on the edge of the desert and was situated atop an artificial hill. The largest of the four towers was built on a stone base 18 meters in diameter. This was most likely where Herod lived; he decorated his rooms with mosaic floors and elaborate frescoes. The other three towers, which consisted of living spaces and storage, were 16 meters in diameter. Outside, several cisterns were built to collect water that was channeled into the palace. Excavation The archaeological excavation of Herodium was begun in 1962 by Virgilio Canio Corbo and Stanislao Loffreda, from the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum of Jerusalem, and it continued until 1967: they discovered the upper citadel, at the top of the hill.Virginio Canio Corbo, Herodion. I: Gli edifici della reggia-fortezza, Jerusalem 1989 From 1972, excavations were carried out by Ehud Netzer, working on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and they were intermittent until the archaeologist's death in 2010. Netzer excavated mostly the lower palace, at the base of the hill. Many archaeologists suspect that mosaic floors and frescoes were common throughout the palace, but it will take more work to reveal them because of the thousands of years that have passed since its construction. Excavated areas Bathhouse The Roman bathhouse consisted of three areas, the caldarium, the tepidarium, and the frigidarium. It also had a very impressive dome which is still in good condition today despite thousands of years of earthquakes and wars. The caldarium had vaulted ceilings, raised floors, and channels in the walls to conduct heat. The tepidarium had mosaic floors and frescoes just like the living quarters of the palace. The frigidarium, the last stop in the bathhouse, was where guests would cool off in a large pool. Roman Theatre Netzer discovered the Roman Theatre just before his death in late 2010. A loggia, or a theatre box, was discovered. This means that when Herod or other notable officials went to see a play, they would receive luxury treatment. The rest of the audience would be seated below on benches that could accommodate about 650 people. What is quite unique about this find is that frescoes of landscapes were discovered. This suggests that the painters were well traveled; they depict scenes of Italy and even the Nile River in Egypt. It is also assumed that the painters were on loan to Herod from Caesar in Rome.

In 2007, in response to an article he had written concerning human rights violations in Yemen, al-Khaiwani was abducted, beaten, and threatened with death by gunmen if he continued to publish. Also that year, the journalist's home was raided after a counter-terrorist team gained access to his home by posing as electricians. While making the arrests, they struck his 7-year-old daughter and knocked her unconscious, as well as beat al-Khaiwani with the butts of their guns before taking him to prison. Police found materials that were widely available about the government's fight against rebels in Saada along with an unpublished article he had written criticizing the president. This resulted in his arrest and he was accused of conspiring with anti-government rebels. He was on trial for sedition in 2008, found guilty, and sentenced to 6 years. President Saleh pardoned him 3 months later, but a special court that hears terrorism cases sentenced him back to 6 years, which resulted in another presidential pardon 14 March 2009.  Assassination  On 18 March 2015, Abdulkarim al-Khaiwani was gunned down in front of his house by three armed men on motor bikes. There was a witness, but she was unable to identify the men. Reports say al-Khaiwani was hit with seven bullets. He was also gunned down by unidentified men who fled on motor vehicles. Al-Qaeda later claimed responsibility for the attack through an online Twitter account saying that two mujihadeen riding motorcycles opened fire on Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani and the gunmen had fled the scene successfully. Al-Khaiwani was rushed to the Science and Technology Hospital on Al-Siteen Street, where he was later pronounced dead. The details of the shooting strikingly resemble the assassination of political activist Muhamed Abd al-Malik al-Mutawakel in November 2014. Context Abdel Karim al- Khaiwani is from Taiz, which is pictured. Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani was fighting against an entrenched system of media oppression. Yemen was ranked 167th in terms of Freedom of the Press. Yemen's ranking in the Annual Worldwide Press Freedom Index from 136th of 167 in 2005 to 168 out of 180 and it ranks 153 out of 177 countries on the UN's human-development index which measures things like education and life expectancy.Reporters Without Borders: 2005 Annual Worldwide Press Freedom Index accessed 8-8-2006 With the Saada war raging in northern Yemen, his news platform was blocked in Yemen During the conflict, the government has refused access to journalists or independent observers. The government has censored the reports. During the Arab Spring movement in Yemen, al-Khaiwani turned his support to the Houthi movement and represented them at the National Dialogue Conference. The conflict between the government and the rebels has led to one of the worst political crises in modern Yemen. The president has stepped down and Yemen is unstable.  Reactions  Khalid Ibrahim, co-director of Gulf Center for Human Rights, said, \\"I knew Abdulkarim for many years as a very brave journalist and human rights defender. He dreamed about a new prosperous Yemen in which there is no violence or discrimination but only social justice. No doubt he will be missed as a prominent activist who tried to be a bridge for peace in the country.\\" The GCHR demanded that the Yemeni government launch an investigation on the assassination of Mr. Khaiwani so that they could publish the results and bring justice to those that deserve it. Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO said, \\"I condemn the murder of Abdul Karim Mohammed al-Khaiwani, a dedicated journalist of outstanding integrity. His death is a loss to the people of Yemen and the quest for informed reporting and debate.\\" Jim Boumelha, president of International Federation of Journalists said, \\"This is an outrageous and cowardly act that cannot remain unpunished. Abdul Karim was a brilliant journalist and fought hard for the underdog. His struggle for independent journalists put him at the forefront of the endeavours by Yemeni journalists to ensure that they work without threat to their lives or undue political interference. My heart goes out to his family. Awards *2008 Amnesty International (UK), Media Awards, Special Award for Human Rights Journalism Under Threat.

It has released albums Cangaia de Jegue (2004) and Voc√™ vai ver (2006) and a live album Cangaia de Jegue ‚Äì Ao Vivo) in 2009. The band is very popular in Bahia state which is its base. The greatest claim to fame of Banda Cangaia de Jegue is their hit \\"Ai se eu te pego!\\". The song appears also in their promotional CD album of same title Ai se eu te pego!. The song co-written by Sharon Acioly and Ant√¥nio Dyggs (and sung much earlier by Os Meninos de Seu Zeh directed by Ant√¥nio Dyggs), became a later massive Brazilian and international hit by Brazilian singer Michel Tel√≥ with slightly amended lyrics. Career In August 2002, four Brazilian university students got together in Jequi√© nicknamed \\"A cidade do sol\\" (city of sun) forming a band that played at university gigs and various social occasions. They wanted to call it the Cangaia band (local slang for \\"yoke\\" put on animals to carry the load). But discovering that the name was already used by another band, they decided to add \\"of something\\" so they picked the donkey (jegue) renaming the band \\"Cangaia de Jegue\\" (the yoke of the donkey) in a cheeky reference to the commonly known area \\"Rep√∫blica dos Jegues\\" (the republic of donkeys).Interview by Bahia Noticias: Cangaia de Jegue diz que Seu Maxixe n√£o √© concorr√™ncia para ela e fala sobre seus hits fazerem sucesso na voz de outros cantores (in Portuguese) Becoming instantly popular in their city, singer Norberto Curvello penned the song \\"Saudade do Interior\\" in gratitude followed by the 2004 self- titled album Cangaia de Jegue, with many tracks becoming hits on local Bahia radio, most notably the songs \\"O beijo teu\\" (Your Kiss) and \\"De frente pro mar\\" (Beachfront) with the latter becoming popular with Estakazero, a well- established local band, doing a cover of the Cangaia track. Cangaia also took part in Jo√£o de Jequi√©, Forr√≥ da Margarida, Forr√≥ da On√ßa, and were regular features at Jaguaquara and Forr√≥ , in Itiru√ßu. In 2006 the band moved to Bahia's bigger coastline city SalvadorCangaia de Jegue: O Forr√≥ Aut√™ntico da Bahia (in Portuguese) for bigger opportunities, releasing their second album Voc√™ vai ver (meaning You will see) following it up with a DVD launched in Jequi√© first and then in other cities, thus competing with better known bands like Estakazero and Seu Maxixe. After the success of the song \\"Ai se eu te pego!\\" by Michel Tel√≥, Cangaia de Jegue are enjoying a huge increase in their popularity throughout BrazilCorreio24Horas: Cangaia de Jegue tamb√©m comemora o estouro nacional de \\"Ai se eu te pego!\\" (in Portuguese) as fans check the earlier versionMusic video of Cangaia de Juege's earlier version of \\"Ai se eu te pego!\\" of the song before Michel Tel√≥'s release.

With the unbroken survival of its indigenous music, Sussex was at the forefront of the English folk music revivals of the 19th and 20th centuries. Many classical composers have found inspiration in Sussex, and the county continues to have a thriving musical scene across the musical genres. In Sussex by the Sea, the county has its own unofficial anthem. Perhaps the first known musical instrument from Sussex is the so-called 'Sussex horn', a variant of the Bronze Age Irish horn. Dating from around 900BC this instrument was found in the late 18th century at the bottom of a well in Battle. Folk music Traditional music Of all the counties in England, it is Sussex that appears to have drawn the greatest attention from folk song collectors over a period of some 130 years. This was due to a flourishing tradition of folk dance, mummers plays (known in Sussex as Tipteers' or Tipteerers' plays) and folk song, but also in part because of the rural nature of the county in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and yet its relatively close proximity to London. Passed on through oral tradition, many of Sussex's traditional songs may not have changed significantly for centuries, with their origins perhaps dating as far back as the time of the South Saxons. Writing in 1752, John Burton commented on the \\"sharp pitch\\" and \\"goatish noise\\" of the Sussexians, which William Henry Hudson thought still held true when writing nearly 150 years later. In the Sussex tradition there is a strong vein of lyrical songs reflecting the life of the countryside and romance. There are also ballads, drinking songs and songs that capture the 'Silly Sussex' humour of the county. Folk song collecting Perhaps the earliest of collections was made by the Revd. John Broadwood in 1843, published as Old English Songs - as now sung by the Peasantry of the Weald of Surrey and Sussex. His niece, Lucy Broadwood, published the anthologies Sussex Songs, English County Songs and English Traditional Songs and Carols. Probably because of the presence of the Broadwoods in the area, most of the traditional Sussex music collected in the early days of the folk revival came from around Horsham. Classical musicians who also explored the Sussex repertoire include Percy Grainger and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Grainger was rather cavalier in his appropriation of the folk melodies he recorded from all over the world, including arrangements of old Sussex tunes such as The Merry King and the Sussex Mummers' Christmas Carol. (Mummers in Sussex dialect are known as Tipteers or Tipteerers). Singer, Henry Burstow, was known to have over 400 songs in his repertoire. Ralph Vaughan Williams' use of the tune of Our Captain Calls All Hands as sung by Harriett Verrall of Monks Gate, near Horsham, as a setting for John Bunyan‚Äôs To be a Pilgrim and George Butterworth‚Äôs arrangement of Folk Songs from Sussex. The tune used by Harriett Verrall was also used by Vaughan Williams in what subsequently became known as the Sussex Carol. Using early sound-recording equipment, Vaughan Williams was able to make actual recordings of some songs, including a 1907 version of The Trees They Do Grow High as sung by David Penfold, the landlord of the Plough Inn at Rusper. Kate Lee, one of the founders of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, found James 'Brasser' Copper and his brother Thomas, the landlord of the Black Horse public house in Rottingdean. In the 1950s Brasser's son Jim, grandson, Bob and others were featured by the BBC and broadcast The Life of James Copper, honouring him with a front cover photo on the Radio Times and asked to sing in London's Royal Albert Hall. Another founder of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, William Henry Gill also collected and arranged folk song material from Sussex. Sometimes song lyrics were recorded with some censorship, such as the Sussex Whistling Song and the Horn Fair song. Sung to the tune of Lillibullero and edited for its coarseness, the Sussex Whistling Song describes the Devil's dislike of the wife of a Sussex farmer in which the refrain was whistled. As is usual in Sussex lore, the Devil is depicted in a foolish light, in this case 'the wife' gets the better of him. In 1861 Mark Antony Lower wrote that \\"The effect, when continued by strong whistles of a group of lusty countrymen, is very striking, and cannot be adequately conveyed by description.\\" An enthusiastic singer of Sussex songs, Hilaire Belloc also wrote some of his own The Horn Fair song was written about a fair known for its drinking and licentiousness. Sussex drinking songs include the Sussex Toast and Twankydillo. Writer Hilaire Belloc, who spent most of his life in the county, enjoyed traditional Sussex singing, writing two drinking songs, the Sussex Drinking Song, which was set to music by Martyn Wyndham-Read, and the West Sussex Drinking Song, which was included in Belloc's novel, The Four Men: a Farrago, and was put to music in 1921 by Ivor Gurney. Belloc wrote about singing as if it were the soul of Sussex and a key part of its identity. Belloc described the 'proper type of song' for Sussex as being the glee, comparing the glee's relationship to Sussex with that of the ritornello of Italy, the seguidilla of Spain, the pastourou of Provence and the saga of the North Sea. Glee harmonies have also been part of the repertoire of the Copper family for several hundred years. Belloc also calls a song named Golier the \\"national anthem\\" of Sussex. Sung at the annual dinner of the now-defunct Men of Sussex Society, The Song o' the Sussex Men, written in Sussex dialect by Arthur Beckett, contains verses about various characters associated with Sussex including St Wilfrid, St Cuthman, St Dunstan, John Dudeney, Tom Paine, Tom Tipper, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Richard Cobden and the Devil. Songs were sometimes associated with ritual. Turn the Cup Over was a one-verse song which would be sung after completion of the summer's harvest and would be held in the open air or in a large hall. A 'chairman' would be appointed to pass the cup to each man in turn, who would drink while the other men sang. After his drink, the drinker would have to use the hat to throw the cup into the air and catch it as it fell. Failure to do so would compel the man to go through the ceremony again. Singing in the pub would also have ritualised elements. The 'chairman' would decide who should sing next. Some men, particularly older men, would have a song they would always sing, and it would have been considered impertinence for anyone else to attempt it. Other singers included Michael Blann, a shepherd from Upper Beeding, George Attrill from Stopham, Hastings fisherman Noah Gillette. Often singing unaccompanied, Sussex's folk music also had musicians, including renowned fiddler, Michael Turner of Warnham. Taken from a tune by Mozart, Michael Turner's waltz is also known as the Sussex Waltz. Some singers like George 'Pop' Maynard in Copthorne and George 'Spike' Spicer in Selsfield in the Ashdown Forest gained a following from beyond their native Sussex. Tester noted that there were a large number of fiddle players in Ashdown Forest before the First World War but by the 1920s there were very few, changes which were reflected across England. Folk revival In the 1960s, English folk music went through a revival of interest, which was also true of folk music in Sussex. Scan Tester's recordings were published posthumously in the 1990 album I Never Played to Many Posh Dances (sometimes misquoted as \\"I Never Played Too Many Posh Dances\\"). Tester was an accomplished musician, playing the concertina, melodeon, bandoneon and fiddle. Sisters Dolly and Shirley Collins from Hastings gained some popularity in the 1960s, producing the 1967 album of mainly Sussex tunes, The Sweet Primeroses as well as the 1969 album Anthems in Eden. According to some commentators, many people believe that the folk-rock revolution of 1969 would not have happened without the album that Shirley Collins recorded with guitarist Davey Graham, released in 1964 as Folk Roots, New Routes\\". Shirley Collins founded the Etchingham Steam Band with her husband at the time Ashley Hutchings while they were living in Etchingham. It was formed after the break-up of the Albion Country Band and ended with the formation in 1976 of the Albion Dance Band. Founding Sussex's first folk club in 1958, Tony Wales also recorded the first LP of Sussex Folk Songs and Ballads in 1957 on the Folkways Records label in New York, and in 1961 organised the first Horsham Folk Festival. 21st century Singing under the name Young Coppers, the young generation of the Copper Family of Rottingdean continue the family tradition of singing, in what is at least the seventh generation to do so. They were also part of the original line-up of The Imagined Village, a project formed to represent the multicultural folk music traditions of the United Kingdom. Brighton-based folk-punk band The Levellers who formed in 1988 continue to play, winning the Roots Award at the 2011 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Combining a vocal sound reminiscent of folk singers Sandy Denny and fellow Sussexian Shirley Collins with sounds from New Orleans and Vancouver, folk-blues band Smoke Fairies emerged in the early 2000s to acclaim, particularly in the United States. Passenger (real name Mike Rosenberg) achieved success in folk-alternative rock genre, both with the band Passenger and as a solo artist. Singer-songwriter Mary Hampton has been critically acclaimed,Jeanette Leech & Richard S Jones, Shindig!, Nov‚ÄìDec 2008, p.80. as have Hatful of RainReviewer Steve Price describes the group as \\"gifted\\", giving \\"impressively polished performances\\" and having a \\"confidently beautiful sound\\" with, in Chloe Overton, a \\"captivating lead voice\\". who combine folk music with bluegrass music. In 2016 Shirley Collins released Lodestar, her first new studio album in 38 years and the following year a documentary film about Collins' return to performing, The Ballad of Shirley Collins, was released. The county has over twenty folk clubs and other venues hosting folk music. There are also annual folk music festivals at Eastbourne, Crawley, Bognor RegisSouth Downs Folk Festival http://www.southdownsfolkfest.co.uk/, retrieved 27/01/14. and Lewes.Folk and Roots, , retrieved 13/02/09; Folk in Sussex, http://www.norman.hopson.btinternet.co.uk/sussexfolk.tml, retrieved 13/02/09. In 2012, Sussex's traditional folk songs were being taught to new generations as part of a project by the South Downs Society, with money from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Following the end of this project in March 2013, the South Downs Folk Singers were formed to carry on singing the old songs in regular pub sessions and festivals throughout the Downs. Since 2015 a cultural charity, Sussex Traditions, has created a public database of thousands of records, relating particularly to traditional song but also to Sussex traditions generally. Classical music Sussex has also been home to many composers of classical music. It is highly likely that two of the three English choirbooks that survive from the early Tudor period originated in Sussex. The Caius Choirbook was presented from the Master of Arundel College to St Stephen's Chapel in Westminster; the Lambeth Choirbook (or Arundel Choirbook) remained at Arundel as a working choirbook. The Arundel choirbook contains works by several composers including Walter Lambe, a former lay clerk at Arundel. The Caius choirbook includes work by Edmund Turges. A tradition of performing polyphonic music was probably firmly entrenched by the end of the fifteenth century. In 1588 Lewes-born singer Nicholas Yonge published the Musica transalpina, a collection of Italian madrigals with their words translated into English. These works were played by another Sussexian, Thomas Weelkes. Sometimes considered one of England's finest composers, Weelkes was better known as a drunkard than for his music. Composer Ralph Vaughan Williams went to school in Rottingdean and married Adeline Fisher, daughter of historian Herbert William Fisher and cousin of writer Virginia Woolf and painter Vanessa Bell, in Hove in 1897. After collecting folk songs in Sussex, Vaughan Williams wrote Sussex Carol, which was the last of three carols he used in his Fantasia on Christmas Carols. Vaughan Williams used five folk songs he found in Sussex for the basis of his Fantasia on Sussex Folk Tunes. During the 1890s Gustav Holst played the trombone in the White Viennese Band on Brighton Pier under Stanislaus Wurm.Eric David Mackerness: A Social History of English Music Holst's ashes rest in the North transept of Chichester Cathedral. At the start of the Second World War Arnold Bax moved to Storrington, where he lived at the White Horse Inn. Ralph Vaughan Williams made several classical compositions based on the Sussex folk songs he recorded Perhaps more than any other composer, John Ireland found inspiration for his music in the Sussex countryside, particularly the downland around Chanctonbury Ring. On his first visit he stayed in Ashington and over the next 30 years stayed frequently in Amberley, Ashington, Shipley and Steyning. Ireland's works inspired by the Sussex countryside include A Downland Suite, Amberley Wild Brooks, Legend for Piano and Orchestra (referring to a legend of ghostly children from a leper colony to be seen on Harrow Hill); Piano Sonata and Cello Sonatas inspired by the Devil's Jumps barrows. Sir Hubert Parry, composed the music for anthem Jerusalem at his Rustington home. The words to And did those feet in ancient time had also been written in Sussex over a hundred years earlier by William Blake whilst living in Felpham. At Knights Croft House in Rustington, Parry wrote the Symphonic Fantasia '1912' (also called Symphony No. 5), the Ode on the Nativity and the Songs of Farewell. Parry also wrote Shulbrede Tunes after his daughter, Dorothea, and son-in-law, Arthur Ponsonby, moved to medieval Shulbrede Priory in Linchmere. Sir Edward Elgar lived near Fittleworth from 1917 and while there wrote some of his finest chamber music including the A minor Piano Quintet and Cello Concerto before moving to Kempsey in Worcestershire. Debussy completed La mer in Eastbourne and wrote Reflets dans l'eau about an ornamental pond in Eastbourne's Devonshire Park. Sussex contralto Clara Butt was the first person to perform Elgar's Land of Hope and Glory. Born of a working-class family in Brighton in 1879, Frank Bridge attended the Brighton School of Music, then joined the Royal College of Music in London, where he received the highest praise from Sir Hubert Parry. Bridge bought land on the South Downs at Friston where he had a cottage built. It was here that he wrote the orchestral suite The Sea, the Piano Sonata dedicated to composer Ernest Farrar, who was killed in action in France in World War One, Enter Spring (originally entitled On Friston Down), Oration for Cello and Orchestra, Phantasm for Piano and Orchestra, the Piano Trio No. 2, the Rebus Overture, the Violin Sonata No. 2, and the third and fourth String Quartets. Probably Sussex's best-known native female composer, Ruth Gipps produced several orchestral works, including five symphonies and two piano concertos. Her clarinet sonata, Op 45, won the 1956 Cobbett prize of the Society of Women Musicians. The Chichester Psalms is a choral work by Leonard Bernstein for boy treble or countertenor, solo quartet, choir and orchestra. Commissioned for the 1965 Southern Cathedrals' Festival at Chichester Cathedral by the cathedral's organist, John Birch, and the Dean, Walter Hussey, the world premiere took place in the Philharmonic Hall, New York. As a child, the composer John Tavener spent his summer holidays at Lady Birley's Sussex house, Charleston Manor where the grand piano was at his disposal and from where he visited Glyndebourne. From 1991 to 2000, Tavener lived with his family near Hurstpierpoint. Composer Orlando Gough is best-known for works written for ballet, contemporary dance and theatre. The composers Jonathan Harvey, Michael Finnissyhttp://www.michaelfinnissy.info/biography2.phpwww and Martin Butler have all taught at Sussex University. Major performers include violinist and violist Nigel Kennedy and the tenor Jonathan Ansell whose pop-opera boyband G4 were discovered in 2004 on the talent show The X Factor before embarking on a solo career in 2007. Glyndebourne Festival Opera was founded in 1934 by John Christie and his wife, the soprano Audrey Mildmay in 1934 at Glyndebourne, one of the world's best known opera houses, and Britain's only unsubsidised opera house. The county is also home to professional orchestras the Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra and the Worthing Symphony Orchestra. Established in 2010, Worthing is the home of the Sussex International Piano Competition. Church music Possibly the oldest surviving music from Sussex is the 14th century Robertsbridge Codex which contains six pieces of music. This manuscript contains one of the earliest pieces of music specifically written for the keyboard. The Robertsbridge Codex is also the earliest evidence of two handed, polyphonic organ music and dates from around 1325.D. E. Bush and R. Kassel, eds, The Organ: An Encyclopedia (Psychology Press, 2006), , p. 328. Hymns Former vicar of Crawley and warden of Sackville College in East Grinstead, John Mason Neale is best known for writing the Christmas carol \\"Good King Wenceslas\\". The words to the hymn \\"Morning Has Broken\\", later a hit for Cat Stevens, were written by Eleanor Farjeon from her Alfriston home, inspired by the Sussex countryside. The village of Wadhurst gives its name to a hymn written by Michael Tippett. Music for radio, television and cinema Inspired by the view across the English Channel from Selsey towards Bognor Regis, \\"By the Sleepy Lagoon\\" by Eric Coates has been used by BBC Radio 4 as the opening theme music for Desert Island Discs since 1942. Coates lived on the Manhood Peninsula, initially at Selsey and later at Sidlesham. Best known for his theme tunes for Doctor Who, Steptoe and Son, Tales of the Unexpected and The Prisoner, Australian-born composer Ron Grainer moved to Brighton in the 1970s and later died in Cuckfield. The winner of a BAFTA Award and Oscar nomination for \\"Walking in the Air\\", Howard Blake grew up in Sussex and continues to live in the county. The song was used for the 1982 animated film The Snowman of the Sussex-based author Raymond Briggs. Blake also wrote the orchestral works in the film score for the film Flash Gordon. Jazz Nat Gonella was part of the Brighton jazz scene and also a resident of Saltdean. In 2005, jazz pianist and vocalist Liane Carroll won two BBC Jazz Awards, while jazz composer and pianist Zoe Rahman received a Mercury Prize nomination for her 2006 album Melting Pot. Brighton-based singer Claire Martin has won the Best Vocalist award in the British Jazz Awards five times. Rock and popular music 1950s Singer of traditional pop music, Alma Cogan's career began with singing with a band at tea dances on Worthing Pier while at art college in the town. Cogan would appear in the UK Singles Chart eighteen times in the 1950s, with \\"Dreamboat\\" reaching no. 1. Other hits from this period include \\"I Can't Tell a Waltz from a Tango\\", \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\", \\"Sugartime\\" and \\"The Story of My Life\\". 1960s Songwriter Mitch Murray wrote several number one singles including two 1963 songs for Gerry and the Pacemakers ‚Äî \\"How Do You Do It?\\" (which was initially given to the Beatles) and \\"I Like It\\". Another songwriter, Ken Howard co-wrote \\"Have I the Right?\\" for The Honeycombs and \\"The Legend of Xanadu\\" for Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, both number one singles. Worthing was home in the late 1960s to the Worthing Workshop, a group of artists and musicians who included Leo Sayer, Brian James of The Damned, Billy Idol and Steamhammer, whose guitarist, Martin Quittenton, went on to co-write Rod Stewart's UK number one hits \\"You Wear It Well\\" and \\"Maggie May\\". Leapy Lee's 1968 single \\"Little Arrows\\" reached number two in the UK singles chart. 1970s Leo Sayer performing on Dutch television in 1974 The 1970s were significant in Sussex as a field outside Worthing hosted Phun City, the UK's first large-scale free music festival.

It is a more-or-less straight drama with some musical numbers and a little comedy thrown in. Plot Out-of-work professor Gilbert Jordan Thompson stops a suicidal stranger named Marian Edwards from jumping off a pier and helps her get a job so she can support herself. Then, he finds an abandoned baby with a note asking someone to give him a good home. When he cannot find anyone to claim the baby, Gilbert \\"adopts\\" him so he will not end up in an orphanage. Meanwhile, the baby's mother, Marian, arrives a few minutes too late to reclaim her son, and frantically tries to find him, not knowing that the man who saved her life is taking care of her child. Soon Gilbert gets a teaching job with live-in quarters at an all-girls school that does not allow teachers to have families. This forces him to hide the baby, whom he calls \\"Chum\\". The students harass the professor and try one scheme after another to get him fired because they are angry at him for replacing the heartthrob professor they loved. When the girls discover Chum and hear his story, they become his \\"forty little mothers\\" and fight for the privilege of taking care of him, also deciding that the professor is not so bad after all. After staff members see the girls making baby clothes and assume the worst, they alert the strict, no-nonsense headmistress, who finds Chum and fires Professor Thompson for breaking the rules. The girls stage a mutiny and barricade themselves in their dormitory, vowing that they will not come out until the professor gets his job back. The professor talks sense into them and prepares to leave, not knowing that Marian has shown up and reclaimed her son. Because she thinks Professor Thompson is the husband who deserted Marian and her baby, the headmistress tries to turn his students against him by bringing the mother and child to the classroom to tell them about it. However, the professor comes in before she can tell them the story, and Marian and he recognize each other. Marian explains that she had to give up her baby after being deserted by her husband, and Thompson explains that he took the baby in. He says the baby had the \\"best care in the world and the love of forty little mothers.\\" Marian thanks the girls for taking such good care of her baby. The professor walks outside and Marian follows so he can say goodbye to Chum. As the professor is leaving the campus, the remorseful headmistress, with all the students in tow, gives him his job back.

A stone cornice on the central block still carries the inscription \\"The Beaufort Arms\\".Beaufort Arms, Royal Commission on the Ancient Monuments of Wales, accessed January 2012 It is a Grade II* listed building as of 27 June 1952.Beaufort Arms, British Listed Buildings, accessed January 2012 It is one of 24 buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. Description The hotel, the \\"handsomest\\" in the square, lies to the side of the Shire Hall. It is of three and one half storeys high, and five bays across. The rear has an extensive courtyard, with stables for coach horses. The building was converted into flats and shops in 1989. The interior was subject to major alteration during the conversion and the only historically significant remaining features are the entrance lobby, with Ionic pilasters and the top-lit staircase. History The Beaufort Arms was named after the Dukes of Beaufort, whose lands these once were. According to Charles Heath in 1804, this inn consisted originally of two small tenements, one a butcher's and the other a corn dealer's, and the inn yard was a fives court managed by a Mr Pye.Charles Heath (1804) Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of the Town of Monmouth In the early 18th century after Pye's death Mr John Tibbs became the owner and developed the inn with the Beaufort portcullis as the sign. The Beaufort Arms became important after the building of the Shire Hall in 1724. Through the influence of the Duke of Beaufort it acquired, in 1760, a part of that new building which encroached on the inn's fives court. The balcony below, facing Agincourt Square, is reputed to have been used by the Dukes of Beaufort for making speeches during elections. As an added attraction, Mr Tibbs built a bridge across the River Monnow and laid out Pleasure Gardens on Vauxhall Fields. The modern bridge accessed from Castle Hill is still known as Tibbs' Bridge. John Wesley visited the gardens in 1784, and wrote of \\"a gently rising ground on the top of which the gentry of the town frequently spend the evening in dancing. From hence spread various walks, bordered with flowers, one of which leads down to the river\\". left The court behind which now has small shops Admiral Lord Nelson stayed here in July 1802 with Sir William and Lady Emma Hamilton, arriving by boat on the River Wye. Following his rapturous reception in the town, Lord Nelson promised to attend a Dinner in his honour on his return journey from Pembrokeshire. Thus, on 19 August, at 4pm, at the Beaufort Arms Inn, the company sat down to \\"a sumptuous entertainment ......for which a fine buck was presented by His Grace the Duke of Beaufort\\". The inn reached its peak during the early 19th century when the Wye Tour was popular and Nelson had given it publicity by staying there. The Beaufort Arms Hotel became the town's principal coaching inn with direct transport to London by famous coaches like 'The Mazeppa' which, in 1830, left the yard at 5am and reached Regent Street at 8pm. The fare was 15 shillings outside and 30 shillings inside.Heather Hurley (2007) The Pubs of Monmouth, Chepstow and the Wye Valley, p75 et seq Longaston Press In more recent times the hotel was one of three hotels in the town owned by the Trust House Organisation.

Through the coaching archway on Agincourt Square the inn yard is surrounded by shops and cafes. Scenes for a 2005 episode of the science fiction television series Doctor Who, \\"The Unquiet Dead\\", were filmed in the courtyard, which masqueraded as the exterior of a funeral parlour.

At the age of 14 he became a scout and then a partisan of the National Liberation Movement. He published his first collection of poetry, and then pursued university studies at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow. After he returned to Albania from his studies, he became an editor and, later, a publisher and literary critic at the state owned publishing house Naim Frash√´ri. There, he encouraged writers such as Ismail Kadare through his literary reviews; he also led the company to publish more translations of foreign literary works into Albanian through the hiring of affirmed writers. Siliqi died in 1963, at the age of 33, on board Aeroflot Flight 12 which crashed near Irkutsk, Soviet Union. Life Drago Siliqi was born on June 9, 1930 in Tirana, Albania. Nephew of the Albanian National Awakening activist and poet Risto Siliqi, in 1944 Drago became a scout and then a partisan of the National Liberation Movement. His first book was published when he was 15, followed by others. He studied literature at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow. After graduating, he returned to Albania and worked as editor and then director of the publishing house Naim Frash√´ri. Siliqi was noted for his work as director of publishing during the 1957-1963 period. Not only was he key to helping young poets and writers such as Ismail Kadare and Fatos Arapi fully develop themselves, but the publishing house under his direction saw a boom of translations from foreign languages. This increase in translations was mainly due to Siliqi's work in gathering the best translators in Albania, such as Dhimit√´r Pasko, Lasgush Poradeci, and Sk√´nder √áa√ßi. Most of the translators were affirmed and retired writers. He was literary critic for the most notable post-World Albanian authors, such Drit√´ro Agolli, Fatos Arapi, Petro Marko, Dhimit√´r Shuteriqi, Fatmir Gjata, and Qamil Buxheli. He also encouraged and helped Ismail Kadare to write The General of the Dead Army, and to later expand it. Siliqi died on July 13, 1963 when Aeroflot Flight 12, on which he was flying from China to Albania, crashed in the vicinity of the Siberian city of Irkutsk, Soviet Union.

In this paper he wrote an Elegy on the Marquis of Anglesey's Leg, a jeu d'esprit which has been persistently attributed to Canning. On the Morning Post he was employed sixteen years, then for three or four years on the Courier, a government paper, as sub-editor. In 1828 he bought a share in the Sunday Times, the tone of which paper he raised as a literary and dramatic organ, Horace Smith, the Rev. T. Dale, Alfred Crowquill, E. L. Blanchard, Gilbert √† Beckett, and others contributing. His Richmond (1827) and The History of George Godfrey (1828) are considered as early examples of the Newgate novel. He was for many years the senior member of the council of the Literary Fund. He was considered an excellent mimic. The last twenty years of his life were spent quietly on his property at Shooter's Hill, Kent, where he died on 8 December 1871, aged 83, and was buried at Plumstead, Kent. He married Anne Camp in 1810 or 1811, and she died on 22 January 1883. His son, Thomas W. Gaspey, Ph.D., of Heidelberg, who died on 22 December 1871, was author of works on the Rhine and Heidelberg, and of several linguistic handbooks. Another son, William Gaspey (born at Westminster 20 June 1812, died at 17 St. Ann's Road, North Brixton, 19 July 1888), was a prolific writer in prose and verse.

The Women to Drive Movement ( qiyƒÅda al-imar æa fƒ´ as- Su ø≈´diyya) was a campaign by Saudi Arabian women, who have more rights denied to them by the government than men, for the right to drive motor vehicles on public roads. Dozens of women drove in Riyadh in 1990 and were arrested and had their passports confiscated. In 2007, Wajeha al-Huwaider and other women petitioned King Abdullah for women's right to drive, and a film of al-Huwaider driving on International Women's Day 2008 attracted international media attention. In 2011, the Arab Spring motivated some women, including al- Huwaider and Manal al-Sharif, to organise a more intensive driving campaign, and about seventy cases of women driving were documented from 17 June to late June. In late September, Shaima Jastania was sentenced to ten lashes for driving in Jeddah, although the sentence was later overturned. Two years later, another campaign to defy the ban targeted 26 October 2013 as the date for women to start driving. Three days before, in a \\"rare and explicit restating of the ban\\", an Interior Ministry spokesman warned that \\"women in Saudi [Arabia] are banned from driving and laws will be applied against violators and those who demonstrate support.\\" Interior Ministry employees warned leaders of the campaign individually not to drive on 26 October, and in the Saudi capital police road blocks were set up to check for women drivers. On 26 September 2017, King Salman issued an order to allow women to drive in Saudi Arabia, with new guidelines to be created and implemented by June 2018. Women to drive campaigners were ordered not to contact media and in May 2018, several, including Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan, Aisha Al-Mana, Aziza al-Yousef and Madeha al-Ajroush, were detained. The ban was officially lifted on 24 June 2018, while many of the women's rights activists remained under arrest. , twelve remained in detention. Background According to scholar David Commins, \\"In 1957, Riyadh pronounced a ban on women driving.\\" , women's rights in Saudi Arabia were highly constrained in comparison to international standards. This included their right to drive cars and other motor vehicles. In 2002, The Economist magazine estimated that the salaries of the approximately 500,000 chauffeurs driving women in Saudi Arabia accounted for 1% of the national income.The Economist, March 2002 1990 driving protest On 6 November 1990, 47 Saudi women in Riyadh drove their cars in protest against the driving ban. They were imprisoned for one day, had their passports confiscated, and some of them lost their jobs as a result of their activism. 2007‚Äì2008 petition and YouTube video In September 2007, the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, co-founded by Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Uyyouni, submitted a 1,100-signature petition to King Abdullah asking for women to be allowed to drive. On International Women's Day 2008, al-Huwaider filmed herself driving, for which she received international media attention after the video was posted on YouTube. Al-Huwaider's drive began within a residential compound, where women are permitted to drive since roadways inside the compound are not considered to be public roads, but she left the compound and drove along a main highway. Al-Huwaider expressed the hope that the ban on women driving would be lifted by International Women's Day in 2009. In June‚ÄìJuly 2007, a Gallup poll found that the majority of Saudi men and women thought that women should be allowed to drive. 2011‚Äì2014 campaign Poster for the Saudi Arabia's #women2drive Movement, artwork by Carlos Latuff In 2011, a group of women including Manal al-Sharif started a Facebook campaign named \\"Teach me how to drive so I can protect myself\\" or Women2Drive that says that women should be allowed to drive. The women said that their campaign was inspired by the Arab Spring. Loujain al-Hathoul was arrested for driving a car, as she was at the UAE-Saudi border The campaign called for women to start driving from 17 June 2011. , about 12,000 readers of the Facebook page had expressed their support. Al- Sharif described the action as acting within women's rights, and \\"not protesting\\". Wajeha al-Huwaider was impressed by the campaign and decided to help. A woman from Jeddah, Najla Hariri, started driving in the second week of May 2011, stating \\"Before in Saudi, you never heard about protests. [But] after what has happened in the Middle East, we started to accept a group of people going outside and saying what they want in a loud voice, and this has had an impact on me.\\" Subaru In mid-2011, as Subaru vehicles tend to be marketed heavily towards women (in the US), several Saudi women groups including Saudi Women for Driving asked the parent company of Subaru, Fuji Heavy Industries, to stop selling motor vehicles in countries where women cannot drive. \\"Saudi Women Call on 'Progressive' Subaru to Leave Kingdom Over Driving Ban\\", Bloomberg, 22 June 2011, Retrieved 24 January 2016. Manal al- Sharif The following week, al-Huwaider filmed al-Sharif driving a car as part of the campaign. The video was posted on YouTube and Facebook. Al-Sharif was detained and released on 21 May and rearrested the following day. On 30 May, al-Sharif was released on bail, on the conditions of returning for questioning if requested, not driving and not talking to the media. The New York Times and Associated Press associated the women's driving campaign with the wider pattern of the Arab Spring and the long duration of al-Sharif's detention with Saudi authorities' fear of protests. Late May ‚Äì early June On 23 May, another woman was detained for driving a car. She drove with two women passengers in Ar Rass and was detained by traffic police in the presence of the CPVPV. She was released after signing a statement that she would not drive again. In reaction to al-Sharif's arrest, several more Saudi women published videos of themselves driving during the following days. Wajnat Rahbini, a Saudi actress famous in the Arab world for playing in the satirical comedy Tash ma Tash, broadcast annually during Ramadan, drove her car \\"in defiance of a long-standing ban on female driving\\" on 4 June in Jeddah. She was detained after exiting her car and released the following day without bail. 17 June 2011 On 17 June, about 30 to 50 women drove cars in towns in Saudi Arabia, including Maha al-Qahtani and Eman Nafjan in Riyadh, and other women in Jeddah and Dammam. When she drove for a second time the same day, al-Qahtani was given a ticket for driving without a Saudi Arabian licence. Al-Qahtani was pleased to receive the ticket, stating to a Time magazine journalist travelling with her, \\"It's a ticket. Write this down. I am the first Saudi woman to get a traffic ticket.\\" The Guardian stated that \\"police appeared to be under orders not to intervene\\" during women's drives on 17 June. Late June 2011 Cartoon for Saudi Arabia's Women to drive Movement by Carlos Latuff Two Saudi women were photographed by Thomson Reuters after driving in Riyadh on 22 June. On 29 June, five women driving in Jeddah were arrested. The Saudi Arabian blogger Eman al-Nafjan described the arrests as \\"the first big pushback from authorities\\". She claimed that the June drives were more significant than the 1990 protest, stating, \\"When actually the 1990 protest was only fourteen cars that had 47 passengers, [from] June 17th and onwards there have been about seventy documented cases of women driving.\\" July‚ÄìSeptember In July, Princess al-Taweel, niece-in-law of Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, spoke about her opposition to the women driving ban on the United States (US) radio station NPR and called for women to have equal rights in the workforce, in the legal system, and in education. She described these human rights as more important than the right to drive. In response to criticisms of women's rights campaigns, she described her approach as \\"evolution not revolution\\". At the end of September, Shaima Jastania was sentenced to 10 lashes for having driven a car in Jeddah. The sentence was announced shortly after King Abdullah decreed that women would be able to participate in the 2015 Saudi Arabian municipal elections and be appointed to the Consultative Assembly; King Abdullah overturned the sentence. November On 15 November 2011, Manal al-Sharif filed charges in the Grievances Board, a non-Sharia specialized court, against the General Directorate of Traffic for the rejection of her application for a driver's licence. Al-Sharif had applied for a licence in May 2011. The lawsuit was transferred to the Ministry of Interior. December In early December, a member of the Consultative Assembly, Kamal Subhi, submitted a report to the Assembly saying that lifting the ban would cause prostitution, pornography, homosexuality and divorce and the \\"end of virginity\\". The head of the Assembly told women campaigners that he was \\"still open to hearing the case for lifting the ban\\". February 2012 On 4 February, Samar Badawi, a human rights activist who had driven regularly since June 2011 and helped other women drivers with police and court procedures, filed similar charges to those of Manal al-Sharif, objecting to the rejection of her own driving licence application. Badawi was asked by the Grievances Board to \\"follow-up in a week\\". The women to drive campaign circulated an email about the court case. June 2012 On 29 June 2012, to celebrate the anniversary of the June 2011 driving campaign launch, a member of the My Right to Dignity women's rights campaign drove her car in Riyadh. She stated that she had driven about 30‚Äì40 times in 2011 and that about 100 Saudi women had driven regularly since June 2011. October 2013 In October 2013, there was a campaign calling for women to defy the ban in a protest drive on 26 October, which gained support from some prominent women activists. In response, the campaign's website (www.oct26driving.org) was blocked within Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Saleh al- Lohaidan, one of Saudi Arabia's top clerics, said women who drive risk damaging their ovaries and bearing children with clinical problems. Interior ministry employees had also contacted leaders of the campaign individually to tell them not to drive. However, despite this discouragement and a heavy police presence, as of Sunday 27 October Saudi activists had posted 12 films on YouTube said to be of women driving on Saturday, and said some other women had also driven but without recording their exploits on video or in photographs. Also a YouTube film made by Hisham Alfageeh and other male Saudi comedians went viral on Saturday to support the women's driving campaign, parodying the Bob Marley song \\"No Woman No Cry\\" as \\"No Woman No Drive\\". Loujain Al-Hathloul On 30 November 2014, Loujain Al-Hathloul made her move toward the Women to drive Movement in Saudi Arabia. As known, Saudi women are not able to have a driver's license, but Al-Hathloul previously obtained a driver's license from the United Arab Emirates. She filmed her experience of driving from the United Arab of Emirates with the intention of crossing the border back to Saudi Arabia. As a part of the support of the issue of the Saudi ban on women drivers. Al-Hathloul filmed herself driving on 26 October 2014. Her videos had over 800,000 views, a hashtag on Twitter, and also over 3,000 comments on YouTube. The public opinion with Al-Hathloul's case was divided to two groups, one group was supportive to what Lujain did, and the other one was not. Al-Hathloul tweeted her followers about her journey from the beginning. When she arrived at the border of Saudi Arabia she tweeted that she was stopped by a Saudi customs officer at the border. Al-Hathloul tweeted to her followers to keep them up with her and said: \\"Twenty-four hours spent on the border of Saudi.\\" She also tweeted: \\"They won't give me back my passport and they won't let me pass through and no word from the Ministry of Interior. Complete silence from all the officials.\\" Loujain Al-Hathloul was arrested after she filmed her attempt to defy the ban of driving for Saudis Women. She was arrested for 73 days. Prince Mohammed bin Salman Prince Mohammed bin Salman talked about the Ban of Saudi Women Driving in an interview and he said that \\"Saudi Arabia is not ready for women drivers\\". The prince Mohammed also said that \\"Women driving is not a religious issue as much as it is an issue that relates to the community itself that either accepts it or refuses it.\\" However, he was later seen as the figure behind the removal of the driving ban in September 2017. |Lifting of ban 2017‚Äì2018 On 26 September 2017, King Salman issued a statement recognizing the right of Saudi women to drive in keeping with Sharia. Licenses were set to be issued to women starting on 24 June 2018. Saudi authorities also contacted women to drive campaigners. Around 15‚Äì18 May 2018, Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan, Aisha Al-Mana, Aziza al-Yousef, Madeha al-Ajroush, and several other women and two men also involved in the women to drive movement and the anti male- guardianship campaign were detained by Saudi authorities. Human Rights Watch interpreted the purpose of the arrests as frightening \\"anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince's rights agenda\\". On 24 June 2018, as promised by Saudi authorities, several women received driving licences and started driving their cars. Many of the women to drive movement and anti male- guardianship women activists, including Loujain al-Hathloul, remained in detention as part of the 2018‚Äì2019 Saudi crackdown on feminists. , twelve remained in detention without any legal charges laid against them and without legal representation. In late November 2018, the Women to Drive campaigners detained in Dhahban Central Prison were tortured. According to Human Rights Watch, several of the women were lashed and given electric shocks, one was \\"made to hang for long periods of time from the ceiling\\" and one tried several times to commit suicide. , the women had been publicly accused of \\"undermining state security and aiding enemies of the state\\" but had not yet been charged. , according to the Saudi newspaper Okaz, the women were to be tried at the Specialized Criminal Court, with prosecutors calling for prison terms of up to 20 years. In late March 2019, the women presented their defence and described physical and sexual abuse they had endured in captivity. Aziza al-Yousef, Dr Rokaya Mohareb and Eman al-Nafjan were released on bail. International solidarity United States An international new media campaign started in the US to support women drivers in Saudi Arabia with tweets, pictures, and YouTube videos of people honking to support women drivers in Saudi Arabia, included Rep. Nancy Pelosi and race car driver Lelani Munter. On 15 June 2011, women drivers in the United States organised a protest in solidarity with Saudi women, planning to encircle the embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, D.C.\\"Protest: Women drivers to circle Saudi embassy\\", Washington Examiner. 15 June 2011.

Accessed 17 June 2011 Recording industry The music video to the M.I.A. song \\"Bad Girls\\", released on 2 February 2012, is a protest piece in solidarity with the movement. Elizabeth Broomhall, writing in Arabian Business, appreciated M.I.A. for \\"pushing boundaries\\" to get the world to pay attention to women's right to drive in the kingdom, and for being a female artist who \\"finally\\" did something different. Lucy Jones of The Daily Telegraph praised the video for its stance against Saudi driving law.

Causes  The major volatile compounds responsible for garlic breath are allyl methyl sulfide, allyl methyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, diallyl disulfide, dimethyl disulfide and methyl mercaptan, along with minor amounts of dimethyl selenide.Cai, X.-C.; Block, E.; Uden, P.C.; Quimby, B. D.; Sullivan, J. J. ‚ÄúAllium Chemistry: Identification of Natural Abundance Organoselenium Compounds in Human Breath after Ingestion of Garlic using Gas Chromatography with Atomic Emission Detection‚Äù, J. Agric. Food Chem. 1995, 43, 1751-1753. Various other sulfur compounds are also produced when allicin in garlic is broken down in the stomach and liver. Out of the many compounds, allyl methyl sulfide (AMS) does not break down quickly and remains in the body in significant amounts hours after consumption, resulting in an odor that can last for hours ‚Äî or even for as long as two days. This appears to be anecdotal evidence. The reporter has quoted it from chemistry professor Eric Block, PhD, and his wife. \\"I'm a garlic lover, and my wife ‚Äî who has an excellent sense of smell ‚Äî says even 48 hours after eating a garlic meal, she can smell it on my skin,\\" Professor Block explained. AMS is the only one of the garlic-derived organosulfur compounds detectable in the lungs or urine, as well as the mouth, which means that AMS is reabsorbed into the blood stream and travels to other organs for excretion - namely the lungs, kidneys and skin.Suarez, F.; Springfield, J.; Furne, J.; Levitt, M. \\"Differentiation of mouth versus gut as site of origin of odoriferous breath gases after garlic ingestion,\\" Am. J. Physiol. 1999, 276(2 Pt 1), G425‚Äì30. Anaerobic bacteria, which do not metabolize oxygen, are a main source for producing Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSC) which cause bad breath.  Remedies  Mouthwash or breath mints are not particularly effective, since the sulfurous compounds are absorbed into the bloodstream, and exit the body through the lungs and skin. Consuming parsley is a common folk remedy. Studies conducted at Ohio State University have shown that drinking milk can reduce garlic breath. Lettuce, chicory, celery, potato, parsley, mint leaves, peppermint, and basil were shown to be the best remedy according to the study. Eating these food raw is more effective than heated. Indeed, enzymes that degrade the sulphuric compound responsible for garlic breath are heat sensitive and found in previously mentioned food.

The KM began operation in 1966, and was continuously tested by the Soviet Navy until 1980, when it was damaged in a testing accident and sank in the Caspian Sea. The KM was the largest and heaviest aircraft in the world from 1966 to 1988, and its surprise discovery by the United States and the subsequent attempts to determine its purpose became a distinctive event of espionage during the Cold War. Design and development The KM was an experimental aircraft developed from 1964 to 1966, during a time when the Soviet Union saw interest in ground effect vehicles‚Äîairplane-like vehicles that use ground effect to fly several meters above surfaces, primarily bodies of water (such as the Caspian Sea). It was designed at the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau, by the chief designer Rostislav Alexeyev and the lead engineer V. Efimov, and manufactured at the Red Sormovo plant in Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod).National Research Council Committee to Perform a Technology Assessment Focused on Logistics Support Requirements for Future Army Combat Systems; Reducing the Logistics Burden for the Army After Next, 1999, Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, p. 68Liang Yun, Alan Bliault; High Performance Marine Vessels; p. 89 (2012)Anne H.

The KM had a wingspan of ; a length of ; a maximum take-off weight of ; and was designed to fly at an altitude of to use the ground effect. The KM was also undetectable to many radar systems, as it flew below the minimum altitude of detection. Despite technically being an aircraft, it was considered by the authorities to be closer to a boat and was assigned to the Soviet Navy, but operated by test pilots of the Soviet Air Forces. The KM was documented as a marine vessel and prior to the first flight a bottle of champagne was broken against its nose, a tradition for the first voyage of a watercraft. The Caspian Sea Monster at Kaspiysk photographed with a KH-8 reconnaissance satellite in 1984. It remained the heaviest aircraft in the world throughout its 15-year service life, and served as the basis for Lun's development. Unlike the Lun, the KM featured a constant-chord main wing and a stabilizer with notable dihedral (visible in the image as a difference in brightness between the left and right side of the stabilizer) and an unswept aft trailing edge. Operational history On June 22, 1966, the completed KM began transportation along the Volga River to the testing grounds on the Caspian Sea near the town of Kaspiysk. It was transported from Gorky along the river in secret, covered in camouflage and moving only at night. The aircraft's first flight was on October 16, 1966, performed by V. Loginov and Rostislav Alexeyev himself, which was very unusual as most Soviet aircraft designers never piloted their own creations. All the work was conducted under patronage of the Ministry of Shipbuilding Industry. Testing showed the KM to have an optimum (fuel efficient) cruising speed of 430 km/h (267 mph, 232 knots), and a maximum operational speed of 500 km/h (311 mph, 270 knots). The maximum speed achieved was 650 km/h (404 mph, 350 knots), although some sources claim up to 740 km/h (460 mph, 400 knots). The KM was at first seen as a promising vehicle specialized for use by military and rescue workers but its design caused many difficulties; progress slowed and Alexeyev moved on to other ekranoplan projects. It was tested on the Caspian Sea for an extensive 15 years until 1980, when it was destroyed following a crash caused by pilot error. There were no human casualties, but the KM was damaged and no attempts were made to save it, it being left to float before eventually sinking a week later. The KM was deemed too heavy to recover and has remained underwater at the crash site ever since, with no plans to build a second ever made.The Register; In search of the Caspian Sea Monster; Lester Haines; 22 September 2006 However, the KM later became the basis for the Lun-class ekranoplan developed by the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau in the 1980s, which saw one example, the MD-160, enter service with the Soviet Navy and later the Russian Navy before being decommissioned in the late 1990s. The aircraft was not destroyed, but abandoned in the Caspian Sea, being visible in 2020. The KM remained the largest aircraft in the world during the entirety of its existence and is the second-largest aircraft ever built, behind the Antonov An-225 Mriya that flew for the first time in 1988, eight years after the KM's destruction. Western discovery The secret Soviet KM project was discovered by the United States in 1967, when photographs taken from spy satellites showed the KM taxiing during testing near Kaspiysk. The strange aircraft puzzled intelligence agencies in the Western world, noting the small stubby wings despite its large size, as well as the \\"KM\\" markings and flag of the Soviet Navy on its fuselage. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) branded the aircraft the \\"Kaspian Monster\\" after the KM markings, it later becoming known as the \\"Caspian Sea Monster\\", while \\"KM\\" actually stood for Korabl-maket meaning \\"Prototype ship\\" in Russian. The discovery, at the height of the Cold War, greatly concerned the CIA, which set up a dedicated task force and developed a purpose-built unmanned drone under Project AQUILINE, just to determine what the secret behind the vehicle was. The KM was initially assumed to be an unfinished conventional aircraft, but it was quickly determined that the vehicle could not fly high. In the 1980s, after the KM was already destroyed, the United States discovered it was a large ekranoplan. The development of ground effect vehicles was not as widespread in the West as in the Soviet Union. In media * The 2006 video game Microsoft Flight Simulator X features the KM in a mission. The Deluxe Edition contains additional missions, one of which also depicts the KM. * Episode 1 of the 2008 series James May's Big Ideas, entitled \\"Come Fly With Me\\", features the story of the KM. * The 2007 Japanese animated film Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone features a rendition of the KM. * The 2016 PC game Soviet Monsters: Ekranoplans features several ekranoplans, including the KM.http://store.steampowered.com/app/372160/Soviet Monsters: Ekranoplans * In the James Bond continuation novel Devil May Care published in 2008, the KM is used by the villain for smuggling. * In the 007: Blood Stone video game the villain also uses ekranoplan in an effort to escape from James Bond, but the latter gets onboard and throws the villain off the vehicle, killing him. Later the ekranoplan can be seen docked and cleaned.

Those stations were intended to support the City of Oakland's plans to improve development along Hegenberger Road - an area largely occupied by airport hotels and industrial businesses. A November 2006 addendum removed the proposed Edgewater Drive station after transit- oriented development plans fell through, and relocated the Maintenance and Storage Facility (MSF) on a short spur adjacent to the Doolittle Drive station to reduce costs. By the time construction began in 2013, several additional design changes were made: the MSF was reduced in size and relocated to between the tracks, and the station at Doolittle Drive was deferred until funding was available. A former union house was demolished to provide space for the MSF. The Oakland Airport Connector opened on November 22, 2014 with only the two terminal stations. If funding is procured, an infill station can be added at Doolittle Drive by constructing platforms, a below-track mezzanine, and stairs and elevators for access.

Most of the trade was done by foreign merchants coming to Ningbo. History Ningbo is one of China's oldest cities, with a history dating back to the Hemudu culture in 4800 BC . Once known as Mingzhou (ÊòéÂ∑û), Ningbo was known as a trade city on the silk road at least two thousand years ago, and then as a major port, along with Yangzhou and Guangzhou in the Tang Dynasty; thereafter, the major ports for foreign trade in the Song Dynasty. Eastern Jin Dynasty Ningbo was the source of Sun En's revolt against the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Sun led the \\"Five Bushels of Rice\\" (Wudou Midao), a Daoist cult. They were called \\"armies of demons\\" and utilized \\"boats with decks\\". Zhoushan served as their main base, but they were defeated in the end in 402. Tang and Song dynasty Miniature model of Ningbo during Tang dynasty, known as Mingzhou at the time Since the Tang dynasty Ningbo was an important commercial port. Arab merchants lived in Ningbo during the Song dynasty when it was known as Mingzhou, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. Another name for Mingzhou/Ningbo was Siming. It was a well-known center of oceangoing commerce with the foreign world. These merchants did not intermingle with native Chinese, practicing their own customs and religion and they inhabited ghettos. They did not try to proselytize Islam to Chinese. During the Song dynasty Ningbo was a host for one of the \\"Offices for merchant ships\\" that were created by the government in many coastal cities to tax foreign imports. The Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234) invaded the Song dynasty in the 12th century. Before he fled to Wenzhou, Ningbo served as a refuge for Emperor Gaozong of Song. In 1130 the Jin army reached Ningbo. But heavy resistance and the geography of the area halted the Jin advance, and they retreated and withdrew. Ming Dynasty The city of Ningbo was known in Europe for a long time under the name of Liamp√≥. This is the usual spelling used e.g. in the standard Portuguese history, Jo√£o de Barros's D√©cadas da √Åsia, although Barros explained that Liamp√≥ was a Portuguese \\"corruption\\" of the more correct Nimp√≥.;Jo√£o de Barros, D√©cadas da √Åsia; 1st Decade, Book IX, Chapter VII. Lisbon, 1552 (e.g., pp. 336‚Äì337, in the 1988 reprint)Jo√£o de Barros, D√©cadas da √Åsia, 3rd Decade, Book II, Chapter VII. Lisbon, 1563 (folio 44 in the original edition and the 1992 facsimile reprint) the spelling Liamp√≥ is also attested in the Peregrination (Peregrina√ß√£o) by Fern√£o Mendes Pinto, a (so- called) autobiography written in Portuguese during the 16th century. For the mid-16th-century Portuguese, the nearby promontory, which they called the cape of Liamp√≥, after the nearby \\"illustrious city\\" was the easternmost known point of the mainland Asia. The Portuguese began trading in Ningbo around 1522. By 1542, the Portuguese had a sizable community near Ningbo in Shuangyu. Portuguese activities from their Ningbo base included pillaging and attacking multiple Chinese port cities around Ningbo for plunder and spoil. They also enslaved people during their raids.(Indiana University)(the University of Virginia) The resulting complaints made it to the province's governor who commanded the settlement destroyed in 1548. Japanese relations The Ming dynasty decreed that Ningbo was the only place where Japanese-Chinese relations could take place. Ningbo, therefore, was the destination of many Japanese embassies during this period. After going into Ningbo they then went to other cities in China. In 1523, two rival embassies were sent to Ningbo by Japan, then in a state of civil war known as the Sengoku period. One of the emissaries was a Chinese, Song Suqing, who had moved to Japan earlier. Song Suqing became involved in a disagreement with a rival Japanese trade delegation, which led to the Ningbo Incident where the Japanese pillaged and plundered in the vicinity of Ningbo before escaping in stolen ships, defeating a Ming pursuing flotilla on the way. As a result of the incident, the port of Ningbo was closed to the Japanese ‚Äì only two more Japanese missions were received (in 1540 and 1549) until the end of the Ming dynasty. Ningbo was one of the places where the Portuguese first encountered the Japanese. Qing dynasty Ningbo was one of the five Chinese treaty ports opened by the Treaty of Nanjing (signed in 1842) at the end of the First Opium War between Britain and China. During the war, British forces took possession of the walled city of Ningbo briefly after storming the fortified town of Zhenhai at the mouth of the Yong River on October 10, 1841. The British repulsed a Chinese attempt to retake the city in the Battle of Ningpo on March 10, 1842. In 1864, the forces of the Taiping Rebellion held the town for six months. In March 1885, during the Sino-French War, Admiral Courbet's naval squadron blockaded several Chinese warships in Zhenhai Bay and exchanged fire with the shore defences. Ningbo was once famed for traditional Chinese furniture production. During the Qing dynasty, western encyclopedias described Ningbo as a center of craftsmanship and industry- \\"The gold and silversmiths of Ningpo are noted for the delicacy and tastefulness of their work, and Ningpo confectionery is celebrated all over China. The specialty of the place, however, is its elegantly carved and inlaid furniture. Silk-culture is extensively carried on in the surrounding country, and silk-weaving is an important industry. In 1893 498 piculs of silk piece-goods were exported. The development of manufacturing interests in Japan has given a groat impetus to cotton-culture, and in 1893 the steam cotton-ginning establishments of Ningpo cleaned over 60,000 piculs of raw cotton.\\"(Original from Harvard University)(Original from the University of Michigan)(LIBRARY OF THE LELAND STANFORD JR. UNIVERSITY)(Original from Columbia University)(Original from the University of California)(Original from Princeton University)(Original from the New York Public Library) A caste of \\"degraded\\" outcasts existed in Ningbo city during the Qing dynasty, around 3,000 people in a class called \\"to min\\". Samuel Wells Williams gave an account of them in his book \\"The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ... Chinese empire and its inhabitants\\": \\"There are local prejudices against associating with some portions of the community, though the people thus shut out are not remnants of old castes. The tankia, or boat- people, at Canton form a class in some respects beneath the other portions of the community, and have many customs peculiar to themselves. At Ningpo there is a degraded set called to min, amounting to nearly three thousand persons, with whom the people will not associate. The men are not allowed to enter the examinations or follow an honorable calling, but are play-actors, musicians, or sedan-bearers; the women are match-makers or female barbers and are obliged to wear a peculiar dress, and usually go abroad carrying a bundle wrapped in a checkered handkerchief. The tankia at Canton also wear a similar handkerchief on their head, and do not cramp their feet. The to min are supposed to be descendants of the Kin, who held northern China in A.d. 1100, or of native traitors who aided the Japanese, in 1555‚Äì1563, in their descent upon Chehkiang. The tankia came from some of the Miaotsz' tribes so early that their origin is unknown.\\"(Original from Harvard University)(Original from Harvard University)(Original from the University of Michigan) A detailed account of an Englishman who stayed in Ningbo can be found in The Chinese repository, Volume 13, published in 1844. He visited the mosque of the local Hui people. The imam was from Shandong, and claimed to be a descendant of Muslims from the city of Medina. He spoke both Arabic and Chinese, and could read Arabic as well. Around 30 families attended his congregation, Quranic verses decorated his apartments, and his possessions included Muslim holy texts and clothing. However, the imam described Hangzhou as being the \\"Stronghold\\" of Islam in the region.(Original from Harvard University) The Hui population of Ningbo were descended from Hui people from Shandong who moved to Ningbo during the 17th century. Their main profession was trade, and they spoke the Shandong Mandarin dialect. The Hui Muslim mosque was called \\"Hwuy- Hwuy Tang\\" HuiHui Tang, in Chinese. The keepers of the building were from Shandong and spoke Mandarin. The mosque was a small building, with many Arabic inscriptions, 500 Muslims lived in Ningbo. There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China are in Kaifeng. These Hui could speak Mandarin Chinese, and read and write Arabic, but were not able to read a single Chinese character. The Ah-hung (Imam) of the Hui community in Ningbo was always from Shandong, their home province. The Ah-hung which the Englishman met was originally from Chi-nan Fu (in Shandong) but for twenty years had been living at Ningbo and Hangzhou. He had an Arabic New Testament in his possision, and he told western missionaries about Jewish communities living in Changsha, Hunan, and at Hangzhou. He mentioned that at Hangzhou are some families of the Kwan Ch'uan-kiao, i.e., the patriarchal sect. When the Chinese Jewish community existed in Ningbo, floods and fire repeatedly destroyed the books of the Kaifeng Jewish synagogue, they obtained some from Ningxia and Ningbo to replace them, another Hebrew roll of law was bought from a Muslim in Ning-keang-chow in Shen-se (Shanxi), who acquired it from a dying Jew at Canton. (the University of Michigan) Massacre of Portuguese pirates During the Qing dynasty, in the 19th century, the Ningbo authorities contracted Cantonese pirates to exterminate and massacre Portuguese pirates who raided Cantonese shipping around Ningbo. The massacre was \\"successful\\", with 40 Portuguese dead and only 2 Chinese dead, being dubbed \\"The Ningpo Massacre\\" by an English correspondent, who noted that the Portuguese pirates had behaved savagely towards the Chinese, and that the Portuguese authorities at Macau should have reigned in the pirates. Portuguese pirates who raided Cantonese shipping in the early 19th century were exterminated by Cantonese forces around Ningbo. The Ningbonese people supported the Cantonese massacre of the Portuguese pirates and the attack on the Portuguese consul. The Cantonese did not see the Portuguese as the same as other Europeans, not being afraid of them and fighting them man to man. The Ningbo authorities had made an agreement with a Cantonese pirate named A'Pak to exterminate the Portuguese pirates. The Portuguese did not even try to fight when the Cantonese pirates sacked their consulate, trying to flee and hide among the tombs, the Cantonese butchered around 40 Portuguese while sacking the consulate. Only two Chinese and one Englishman who sided with the Cantonese died.(the University of California)(the New York Public Library) Protestant Missionaries Western missionaries set up a Presbyterian Church in Ningbo.

Plot In the Southern United States community of Titwillow, two attractive young women, Annie (Lindsay Bloom) and Mary Lou (Jana Bellan) are on their way to work at the diner. Annie is behind the wheel of the pickup truck and speeds while drinking beer. The local redneck law officer, Sheriff Waters (Joe Higgins) pursues the truck to the diner but, upon entering, steps on a banana peel and takes a pratfall to the delight of diner old-timers Hank (Doodles Weaver) and Luke (Ronald Marriott) who were watching the peel. The girls' employer, Aunt Tess (Danna Hansen), is on the verge of losing her place to the banker, Mr. Piker (Donald Elson), because she is 5,641 dollars and 87 cents behind on the mortgage. Sheriff Waters arrests Annie and her boyfriend Bobby Joe (Bruce Boxleitner) for nude swimming, but later releases her and offers to pay Aunt Tess' indebtedness if Annie would marry him. When Annie comes to him, however, he admits to having only a hundred dollars, intending to make up the remainder from \\"collecting parking tickets\\". Annie and Mary Lou drive to Miami where Annie's sister Flora (Louisa Moritz) lives in an elegant apartment, hoping to borrow the mortgage money from her, but Flora's inadequate earnings appear to derive from men who pay her for sexually entertaining them. One of her customers, a nervous married man (Sid Melton), develops a sneezing problem and hides in a large wicker basket when Annie and Mary Lou arrive. Flora suggests that Annie find a sugar daddy to fund her needs, but wealthy Frenchman Louis Danton (Oscar Cartier) is revealed to have a Napoleon complex, replete with uniform, sword and wooden horse head on a stick. Mr. O'Meyer (Raymond Danton), a confidence trickster, who also calls himself \\"Oscar Meyer\\", claims to be \\"as rich as Rockefeller\\", but after tricking Annie into an intimate encounter, steals what little money she had and leaves her a note signed \\"The City Slicker\\". Finally, another candidate, moneyed Texan Jack Whittlestone (Richard Kennedy) turns out to have a violently possessive wife Edna (Montana Smoyer) who pushes a shotgun barrel up to his nose. Discouraged and disillusioned, Annie and Mary Lou return to the diner in Titwillow where, just as Sheriff Waters and banker Piker arrive to finalize the foreclosure, Mr. Bates (Stubby Kaye), a salesman who is also a jewelry collector, examines Annie's necklace and offers her 7,000 dollars for it. The frustrated sheriff puts his wide-brimmed hat, into which Mary Lou had poured milk, on his head and, on his way out, bumps into a midget baker (unbilled Billy Barty) carrying white cream pies, one of which winds up smeared over the sheriff's face.

Bourbon became one of the most recognizable residents of La Jolla, an affluent neighborhood of San Diego, California, where he lived for several decades. He was killed when a truck pinned him while he was dumpster diving.  Background  King Alfonso XIII in his youth Alfonso de Bourbon was born Leon Shafferman in the south of Switzerland, but changed his name in 1968. His family came from Egypt. Morris Shafferman, his father, was also an eccentric, and changed his name to Patrick Stewart. Bourbon attributed his lack of fingers to frostbite. In an interview with the Spanish historian Jos√© Mar√≠a Zavala, he claimed to have been born in Lausanne, Switzerland, and left there in the care of Roman Catholic nuns, who informed him that he was the premarital son of Alfonso, Count of Covadonga, and his first wife, Edelmira Sampedro y Robato. The Count of Covadonga was the eldest son of King Alfonso XIII of Spain and Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, and was heir apparent to the Spanish throne under the title of Prince of Asturias until he renounced his succession rights.Muere atropellado por un cami√≥n Alfonso de Bourbon, un supuesto familiar del Rey ABC.es, 13 January 2012 (Spanish) Bourbon wrote a book about his alleged royal lineage. His physical resemblance to the King, polyglotism, manners, and ceremoniousness convinced many of his acquaintances that he was, in fact, of royal heritage. Bourbon claimed to have learned Spanish, English, French, German, and Italian while at boarding school. He said he studied political science at the University of Paris and the Heidelberg University, and that he then worked as an interpreter for the United Nations in New York City. He explained that his father died in a car crash in Florida in 1938, and that he lived in Paris, Germany, and New York. In January 1969, The New York Times reported that Bourbon bid on La Peregrina pearl, which once belonged to the Spanish royal family: Bourbon was outbid by the actor Richard Burton, who bought it as 37th-birthday present to his wife, the actress Elizabeth Taylor. Bourbon's friends claimed that the Queen, who died later that year, left him enough money to sustain him for life. Nevertheless, Bourbon never laid claim to any inheritance to which he would have been entitled as a member of the royal family, and never contacted King Juan Carlos, his supposed first cousin.  Life in La Jolla  In 1975, Bourbon moved from New York to La Jolla, a neighborhood in San Diego, California. Having quickly become one of the most recognizable residents of the neighborhood, where he owned a condominium apartment, Bourbon was a regular guest at fundraising parties for civic and social organizations, including the San Diego Opera. In the 1990s, Bourbon played a key role in establishing the sister city relationship between San Diego and the Spanish town of Alcal√° de Henares. In 2010, he donated an historic map titled \\"The Spanish Heritage and Contribution to the American Independence 1512‚Äì1823\\" to the University of California, San Diego in celebration of Columbus Day and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as in honor of the institution's 50th anniversary. He served as Navy League of the United States ambassador in 2011, and was also president of the San Diego-Alcal√° de Henares Sister City Society, and led a few tourist trips to Alcal√° de Henares. Bourbon was known for his flirtatiousness. While living in La Jolla, he became involved with the socialite Magda Gabor, the eldest of the three Gabor sisters. Advised by her sisters, Gabor turned down his marriage proposal. He claimed to have been married once, but that the marriage was short-lived.  Death  In his old age, Bourbon often cadged food and clothes from his neighbours. He was dumpster diving when he died around 6 p.m. on 10 January 2012; a tractor- trailer reversed and pinned him between a dumpster and a loading dock wall behind a market. The driver was unaware that Bourbon was there. The market employee who identified his body described him as \\"a colorful part of La Jolla\\" and \\"a nice man\\". A memorial service took place on 20 January at Mary Star of the Sea Catholic Church. On 21 February 2012 his remains were cremated and the ashes sent to the sea, which he had prepaid. The cremation and deposition of ashes was delayed because Bourbon's next of kin had to be notified, although they never responded. Bourbon's first cousin, living in Miami, explained that Bourbon's family cut contact with him 50 years earlier due to his eccentricity.

The resort is touted as Universal Orlando's flagship resort and was the first hotel on Universal Orlando property. It was designed to offer the ambiance of an Italian seaside village with many of the guest rooms overlooking the resort's own lake, Portofino Bay. Loews Hotels is the owner and operator of this resort, as with Portofino Bay's sister resorts, Hard Rock Hotel and Loews Royal Pacific Resort.

The present shop frontage is late nineteenth century.Agincourt House 1 and 1a, Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments, accessed 25 January 2012 From around 1830 to the end of the 19th century it was an Ironmongers. In 1830 the proprietor was Josiah Coates, who was also a Blacksmith, Brazier, and Tinplate Worker. From the early 1860s to 1883 the proprietor was Joseph Coates, with the words 'Furnishing' and 'Ironmonger' on the shop fascia to either side of the name 'Coates'. He also undertook the duties of Blacksmith, but he was also a Nailmaker, Locksmith, and Bellhanger. Joseph Coates (d. 1883) was a Chorister and Church Warden at St Mary's Priory Church. It is said that John Major, the UK Prime Minister 1990-7, is a descendant of the Coates family. From 1884 the premises were occupied by another Ironmonger, namely William Honeyfield, who was a very prominent citizen in Monmouth and was Mayor of Monmouth 1891‚Äì95. He was also a Mason and a member of the Bellringers at St Mary's Priory Church, and took part in a 10-part Peal of Bells recorded on a Plaque in the Bell Tower (Thursday July 1, 1896). In 1919 the premises were occupied by the YMCA, and in the early 1920s by Cash & Co. (Boot and Shoe Makers). The name Cash & Co. may still be seen in the mosaic floor to the front entrance doorway. By 1934 the premises had been taken over by W. & E. Turner Ltd., Shoe Retailer. 'Le Gourmet', the butchers currently in Church Street, occupied the shop in the 1980s when it closed as a Shoe Retailer. After the butchers moved out the premises were extensively restored and were given an award by Monmouth Civic Society on 16 October 1991. From 1992 up to March 2010 the premises were an Antiques Shop, and it is now (2012) a clothes shop, with offices on the upper floors.

There is no Fighting Spirit prize awarded, although Kyokutenho, who won his first nine bouts, would have received it had he won on the final day. The j≈´ry≈ç championship is won by Jokoryu, who secures promotion to the top division after just nine tournaments as a pro ‚Äì the fastest rise since the introduction of six tournaments a year in 1958. Georgian Kokkai, the first European to reach the top division in 2004, announces his retirement due to persistent injuries. *26: The Sumo Association announces that Harumafuji has been promoted to the 70th Yokozuna, making him the fifth foreigner to make the rank.

November *1: The Sumo Association says that it has received an application for just one new recruit for the forthcoming tournament.

Harumafuji can only score 9‚Äì6 and loses his last five bouts, the first debut yokozuna ever to do so. Hakuho‚Ä≤s victory is his sixth straight in Kyushu, and he also ensures that for the sixth year in a row he has the most wins of any rikishi, with 76, although this is well down on the record of 86 he set in 2009 and 2010. There are several withdrawals through injury, including Baruto who loses his ozeki status as a result. Kotooshu and Kotoshogiku however, maintain their ranks with 9‚Äì6 and 8‚Äì7 respectively. Sh≈çh≈çzan wins the Fighting Spirit Award for his strong performance at maegashira 2. In the Juryo division, Tochinowaka races to a 13‚Äì0 lead but then loses his last two bouts and misses out on the yusho, which goes to Sadanofuji on 14‚Äì1. * 26: After a meeting of the Yokozuna Deliberation Council at the Kokugikan, its chairman Takuhiko Tsuruta criticises Harumafuji‚Ä≤s 9‚Äì6 performance as unacceptable, saying \\"as a yokozuna, you at least have to be able to get double digits wins, or you don't qualify.\\" He even suggests the Council may have erred in recommending Harumafuji for promotion ‚Äì \\"His poor performance leaves us with the feeling that we might have promoted him too quickly.\\" December * 24: The banzuke for the forthcoming January tournament is released.

The observatory is owned and operated by the University of Calgary (UC), and was dedicated in 1972. The facility is used for research, undergraduate and graduate teaching, and public outreach. Research performed at the RAO included a variable star search program, follow-up observations of variable star discoveries, and detailed investigation of binary stars. An outstanding minor planet search program was also performed with comet discoveries by Rob Cardinal.https://www.ucalgary.ca/rao/announcements The RAO now participates in many follow-up observation programs, including the Quark Nova project. Telescopes * The A.R. Cross Telescope (ARCT) is a Ritchey- Chr√©tien design dedicated in 1987. It is attached to an unusual altitude- altitude (alt-alt) mount which allows greater access to northern skies than other mounts. It was originally equipped with metal mirror acquired many years earlier, but even before the telescope was completed, plans were made to acquire a conventional mirror. This new primary was fabricated in the 1980s and, under a cost-sharing agreement, used from 1990 to 1993 at Apache Point Observatory. The glass mirror was finally installed in 1996. The telescope is equipped with the Rapid Alternate Detection System (RADS) developed at UC. The computer-controlled \\"chopping\\" of the secondary mirror enables observers to perform differential photometry with the telescope. * The Baker-Nunn Telescope was built in 1957 and donated in 1981 to RAO by the Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake. It is a modified Cassegrain reflector which was used to track satellites under a United States Air Force program. The original altitude-altitude- azimuth mount was replaced with a simpler equatorial mount when the telescoped was refurbished in 2004. DFM Engineering performed the work with the help of UC. * The Clark-Milone Telescope (CMT), named after former co-directors Alan Clark and Eugene Milone, was installed at RAO in 1972. It was used to develop RADS in the early 1980s.

Formerly a mineral water works,Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales: Glendower Street. accessed 16 January 2012 it is currently used as residential apartments. The building holds one of the 24 blue plaques awarded by the Monmouth Civic Society to buildings of especial historical and social interest, and features on the Monmouth Heritage Trail. History A mineral water works, for the manufacture of soda water, lemonade and ginger beer, was established in Glendower Street in 1866 by Thomas E. Hyam, a leading figure in nineteenth century Monmouth. He was a corn and timber merchant, saw mill owner, and shop owner, who became Monmouth's mayor in 1875/6 and was also a Justice of the Peace. To quote Keith Kissack,Kissack K (1986) Victorian Monmouth Monmouth Historical and Educational Trust, Monmouth \\"No committee or association was considered complete unless it included his name\\". Residences in Monmouth associated with the Hyam family were Cornwall House in Monnow Street and Parade House on North Parade. In 1870, the Duke of Beaufort commended his mineral waters, writing: > \\"For upwards of six months I have used no Seltzer water but Mr Hyam's of > Monmouth‚Ä¶ I have found it most excellent. I have never been so well > supplied.\\"Monmouth Civic Society, Monmouth Heritage Blue Plaque Trail, n.d., > p.24 In 1895 Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire for 1901 describes John B Hyam's business as \\"mineral & aerated water manufacturer & ale & porter merchant.\\" Kelly's Directory 1901, Monmouth About this time proprietary medicines became popular and were advertised in the Monmouthshire Beacon, amongst which was 'Hyam's Anti-Influenza Tonic Water'. Hyam owned a saw mill and timber yard at Wyesham, and owned boats known as trows for hauling his timber and carrying goods on the River Wye. He also had a retail shop at 33, Monnow Street, designed by Lawrence of Newport and built by Lewis of Monmouth in 1866. The new building of freestone with Aberdeen granite pillars was widely praised at the time. The spandrels were elaborately carved and it was one of the first shops in Monmouth to introduce curved plate glass windows. The premises are, in 2012, occupied by a kitchenware and gifts retailer. In 1911 the business was taken over by Charles Ballinger, and traded as Ballinger's Mineral Water Works until the 1960s. Ballinger was also the landlord of the Griffin Hotel in Whitecross Street. He traded as a Mineral Water Manufacturer and bottler of Bass and Worthington's Ales, Guinness Stout and Wheatley's Hop Bitters.advert in the Monmouthshire Beacon, December 1914) This continued until the 1960s when the firm closed down. The premises were then occupied by Ebley Ltd., a tyre company, who subsequently relocated to the Mayhill Industrial Estate, and the buildings on Glendower Street were converted into apartments and named Hyam Court.

Fought on 27 and 28 December 1943, the battle took place as the Australians advanced towards the Japanese strong hold around Shaggy Ridge, and was a preliminary phase in their eventual capture of that position in January 1944. Supported by artillery, mortars, machine guns and fighter-bomber aircraft, the assault was made across a narrow frontage, which was usually not much wider than a single section. Two companies of Australian infantry were committed to the attack, with one securing the initial crest, while the other exploited the position and secured several other smaller features throughout the two days of fighting. In the aftermath, Japanese artillery harassed the Australians holding the position, and subjected them to several counter-attacks, which were eventually defeated. Background After hard fighting in the Pacific throughout 1942, the following year Australian and US forces began to gain momentum against the Japanese, and were contemplating going on the offensive. In New Guinea, the bloody Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona had been fought to a conclusion in January, while a Japanese attempt to secure the vital airfield at Wau, near Salamaua, had also been repelled that month. Throughout mid-1943, the Australians had fought a campaign against the Japanese in the Salamaua region, as they had advanced east from Wau towards the Huon Gulf. In September, an amphibious landing near Lae was carried out in conjunction with an airborne assault on Nadzab, aimed at capturing Lae. At the same time, Australian troops, who had been reinforced by several US battalions, continued to keep up the pressure around Salamaua, which fell in mid-September around the same time as Lae. As the Allies sought to follow up the large number of Japanese troops that managed to withdraw from Lae, they subsequently launched the Huon Peninsula campaign. After the 9th Division had secured Finschhafen and Sattelberg, the next major objective in New Guinea was to capture Shaggy Ridge in the Finisterre Ranges, a series of high positions held by Japanese infantry, supported with some artillery. This task was allocated to the Major General George Vasey's 7th Division, which had ‚Äì after the capture of Lae ‚Äì advanced to Dumpu before beginning an advance through the Markham and Ramu Valleys towards the Finisterre Ranges. In October, the 21st Infantry Brigade began a tentative push towards the foothills surrounding Shaggy Ridge, and in the middle of the month fought a sharp defensive action around John's Knoll and Trevor's Ridge after the Japanese counter-attacked an Australian force that had cut the main Japanese line of supply. Battle Shortly after the fighting around John's Knoll, the 25th Infantry Brigade had relieved the 21st and had begun patrolling the area, while aerial reconnaissance attempted to locate the Japanese artillery, which was engaged by the guns of the 2/4th Field Regiment. Throughout the previous months, the Japanese had largely sought to avoid contact, but after several months Allied reconnaissance began detect a build up of Japanese troops. By early December, the Japanese began sending reinforcements south of Bogadjim through Saipa and Orgorunna. In response, the Australians began planning their own offensive to secure Shaggy Ridge, and the 21st Infantry Brigade subsequently took over from the 25th once again. In order to assault Shaggy Ridge and the Kankiryo Saddle, the Australian 7th Division had to secure a foothold on the southern slope of the ridge around a position dubbed \\"The Pimple\\", which was one of three rocky outcrops, held by the Japanese on the ridge line. The Japanese troops defending the area were drawn from 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 78th Infantry Regiment, which formed part of the Nakai Detachment under the command of Major General Masutaro Nakai, who was subordinated to the 18th Army. Australian estimates of the strength of these forces around the Pimple placed them at around three platoons. For two months the Pimple held up the Australian advance; and attempts by the Australians to find a way around the position had been thwarted. Australian commanders subsequently decided that a direct attack would be required in order to deny the Japanese the use of the position for observation purposes. A wounded Australian is led towards medical attention. The wounded soldier, Corporal Merv Hall, later received the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the assault. The 2/16th Infantry Battalion, temporarily under the command of Major Garth Symington, was given the task of attacking the Pimple, and exploiting beyond it. The 2/16th had been reinforced with hundreds of new troops after earlier losses, with many coming from the disbanded 16th Motor Regiment. The initial plan had been for the assault to begin on 21 December, but this was subsequently deferred so that the Australians could partake in Christmas celebrations. An elaborate fire support plan was implemented, including artillery and mortar preparations and support by fire positions, which included Vickers medium machine guns. In addition, Kittyhawk fighter- bombers from the US Fifth Air Force also attacked the position, with aerial control being provided by Boomerangs from No. 4 Squadron RAAF. Due to unpredictable weather, the final time of the assault was not set and in the early morning of 27 December 1943, as a thick haze of mist melted away from around The Pimple, the assault began with an air attack around 08:06 hours. Following the one hour long preparation, the 2/16th went in with two companies leading the assault: 'B' Company in the lead, with 'D' Company following it up. At the same time, the 2/27th Infantry Battalion carried out a feint attack along the Faria River. Overhead, Vasey viewed the battle in a Piper Cub light aircraft. 'B' Company attacked with a \\"one up, two back\\" formation for its platoons. Ladders fashioned out of bamboo were brought up to help the infantry scale the steep shale cliffs, but these proved too difficult to maneouvre and were discarded in favour of climbing on hands and knees. The preparatory fires had the desired effect and for the most part the defenders were dazed, reducing the effectiveness of their resistance. However, on the left of the assault, the advance was held up by a pillbox that had to be attacked from the flank by a section from the right. Exploiting the position, the section began to establish themselves near the summit by around 09:46, while the rest of the platoon pushed further towards another small outcrop, clearing Japanese from their entrenchments. Following the arrival of the Australian company commander with an artillery forward observer, another platoon pushed through the second outcrop in an effort to further exploit the position, but found itself held up around \\"Green Sniper's Pimple\\", as it came up against a strongly held Japanese bunker. 'D' Company subsequently arrived to consolidate the position and relieved 'B' Company, digging in throughout the night, and cutting a track up towards the bunker. Just before first light, Australian engineers brought up makeshift chemical grenades which were thrown at the bunker to set it alight. Under the cover of an artillery smoke screen, one of the Australian platoons advanced up the eastern face of the ridge, in order to approach the flanks of the position. They took heavy fire, but secured the third outcrop by midday, and from there they were able to lay down covering fire for another assault on a fourth position along the ridge, which became known as \\"McCaughey's Knoll\\". This gave the Australians full possession of the Pimple, and from there they had observation as far as the north coast where they could see Madang. Aftermath The attack was successful, driving the Japanese off the position on 28 December 1943; Australian losses during the main assault were low, with only three men killed and eight wounded. Japanese casualties reported by the Australians amounted to 28 killed. Australian troops held the Pimple against further counter-attacks and shelling, during which the 2/16th suffered further casualties. In mid-January 1944 further attacks were followed up against the main Japanese positions during the Battle of Shaggy Ridge. The capture of Shaggy Ridge was followed by the pursuit of the Japanese forces that withdrew towards Bogadjim on the north coast. From there, the Australians linked up with US and Australian forces that had advanced from Saidor as part of the drive along the coast from the Huon Peninsula. A further Japanese withdrawal occurred towards Madang and then Aitape. Madang was captured by Australian forces in late April 1944, while US forces landed at Aitape that same month, later fighting around the Driniumor River.

It had a coach entrance from Priory Street when the new by-pass was built, and this archway provides one entrance to what is now White Swan Court, with the other entrance from narrow Church Street. The name probably refers to Mary de Bohun, who gave birth to Henry V in Monmouth Castle ‚Äì the heraldic badge of the Bohun family was the Bohun swan, a swan collared and chained. The White Swan was appropriated for a billet by a Troop of the 12th Lancers when the Chartist Trials took place in the Shire Hall in 1840. This event caused great consternation amongst the \\"respectable folk\\" of the town who feared a revolution and thought that the Lancers were there to protect them. The hotel continued until the late 1950s, and its lead sign of a swan was still displayed here until stolen some years ago. Now the courtyard provides for a pleasant collection of shops, a coffee house and a cafe bistro. In Church Street, it is worth noting the rather irregular bow window to the chemists by the entrance to White Swan Court, which the poet laureate John Betjeman said \\"must never be demolished\\".

The school was built in 1911 by the residents of Brownlee, one of the several small mining communities which had grown in the Boise River basin in the late 19th century. The two-room schoolhouse was built in keeping with contemporary standards for rural schools; it provided for heating and ventilation, had several windows to provide light, included two cloakrooms and a library room, and featured hand- carved wooden trim for decoration. Like many rural Idaho schools, the schoolhouse also served as the local community center. The declining local population and the expense of new safety regulations in the 1940s spelled the end of Brownlee's school, and the district merged into Sweet's district in 1951. The building was purchased by area residents to serve as a community center and is now the only active community building in the area.

The tollway service is operated under Tollway Concession Agreement in Respect of the Highway No. 31, Viphavadi - Rangsit Road, Din Daeng - Don Muang Section, made between the Department of Highways and the Company, to provide services to the people until September 11, 2034. The concession is in BTO system (Build-Transfer-Operate), i.e., the Company designed and built the tollway with its own funds, and was awarded the concession right to manage the tollway, including toll collection, traffic management, and rescue work, while the ownership of the property has been transferred to the Department of Highways. In its capacity as a party to the concession agreement and as the state, the Department of Highways has specified the toll rates and the timeframe for toll rate adjustment in the concession agreement and it is the duty of both parties to strictly comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement. The private sector's operations differ from those of state enterprises or government agencies in transport project investment as the government has its mechanisms to finance transport projects without financial costs, probably by setting budgets acquired from tax collection or, if necessary, from other financial sources for investment in government projects, with special arrangements on interest rates and loan repayment periods. Besides, no concession periods are set for government projects; they can be operated for life, therefore, it is free to determine if toll collection is required or not for a project, and there exists a mechanism to determine the toll rates into any form as the conditions for government projects are far better than those for the private sector. The Company as a member of the private sector has to operate projects under the concession period. The Company can manage projects and earn revenues within the time frame of the concession period only, while the funds for the Company's project investment are mobilized from both local and foreign investors or from financial institutions with certain financial costs and loan repayment periods, depending on the market‚Äô practices and conditions. The Company has to use the revenue acquired from toll collection within the time limit of concession period to repay the investors or financial institutions so that they can continue to provide financial support. In the future, this elevated tollway will become a part of Mortorway No.5 which starts from Bang Pa-in to Mae Sai and Chiang Khong.

The building is of three storeys, with a roof of Welsh slate and a wooden Doric doorcase.Edwards of Monmouth, Former Angel Hotel. Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments of Wales, accessed 20 January 2012 During the late nineteenth century, the hotel was the headquarters of the Monmouth Branch of the Cyclists Touring Club. It is now a furniture shop, and one of 24 buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail.Monmouth Civic Society, Monmouth Heritage Blue Plaque Trail, n.d., p.19  History  This site began life as Robert le Ffrere's shop around 1240, rented by him for one pound of cumin paid annually. About 40 years later it was acquired by Edmund of Lancaster, (Edmund Crouchback, brother of Edward I), and he granted half a mark yearly, out of the profits, to maintain a lamp burning day and night before the altar of the Holy Cross in the parish church. It was said that the lamp was still burning two hundred years later, but by 1613 the shop had become the brew house for St Mary's Priory Church, Monmouth. By 1700 it was an inn with the appropriate name of The Angel. It remained The Angel Inn until 1965, an extraordinarily long existence for an inn, when it was returned to its former use as a shop. In 1720, when the landlord was John Roome, one of his customers stole two pewter plates and a flaxen napkin. She was caught and whipped at the cart's tail around the town. In 1804, Charles Heath was plainly impressed by the inn, since he wrote: \\"The Angel Inn kept by Mrs Pugh, has long been a house of great respectability, and frequented by the mercantile travellers of the kingdom, whose business connects them with the trading part of the borough, - and is but justice to add, that her kind attention to her guests, has long secured her the highest place in their good opinion\\". The inn was nearly destroyed in 1857 when a disgruntled jockey, who had been beaten at Monmouth Races, tried to set fire to the winning horse which had been stabled there. He was caught in the act and convicted. The Angel had several Friendly Societies, and a Society of Tradesmen and Others met there in 1794. Later, the Black Swan Friendly Society transferred to it, and in 1850 the Sons of Equity met there. In 1884, the landlady, Mrs Creeper, advertised the fact that \\"The omnibus passes the door to meet every train\\". These were the coaches from the King's Head Hotel and Beaufort Arms Hotel which called at the Angel Hotel to pick up passengers. At one time, cycle touring was a popular pastime along the Wye Valley, and the Angel became the headquarters of the Monmouth Branch of the Cyclists Touring Club. Together with the Beaufort and King's Head, the Angel became a Trust House Hotel in the mid- 20th century and closed around 1965. It remained The Angel Inn until 1985, when it closed and was extensively altered in its conversion to a furniture showroom.

This film was thought to be lost but has been found. It is also one of the earliest in the cartoon series to feature Manny Gould and Ben Harrison's version of Krazy, the first of few incarnations derived from George Herriman's famous character. Rediscovery In 1948, cartoon producer Margaret J. Winkler had all the 1925‚Äì1929 Krazy Kat films kept in a storage facility. Because the films were made of a dangerous material called nitrocellulose, Winkler figured she had to get rid of them. Although a neighbor of hers showed interest in buying the films, she was still reluctant, and therefore gave the reels their final fate. Nevertheless, a copy of The Stork Exchange and three other Krazy shorts were rediscovered in 2004 at an archive of the British Film Institute. Plot Krazy is driving his car on an urban road. As he goes on his journey, he spots a bird above, suspending something under its beak. The curious Krazy turns his vehicle into an aircraft, and takes off to investigate. Coming close in his flying car, he is amazed that the bird he spotted is a stork carrying an infant. He then sees the stork handing the child to a person on a rooftop before leaving. Although the bird leaves with an empty beak, Krazy continues to follow it. The feline follows the stork into an adoption center up on the clouds. Inside, he is intrigued to see orphaned infants groomed and taken out of the place by other storks for delivery. Lunch time comes just then and one of the birds calls Krazy to watch over the infants. The infants are loud and bothersome but Krazy is able to keep them company. Suddenly, he receives a customer's order by phone. The cat then selects the suitable child for the delivery and takes off. Up in mid-air for a few moments, Krazy is carrying the infant smoothly. But things become quite difficult for him as the tyke starts playing mischievously. Nevertheless, they reach the customer's house on time. When the infant's diaper comes off, the feline tries to put it back. The infant, however, refuses to wear it, and Krazy tries to do things in a scuffle, only to put the diaper on himself. The child then disappears mysteriously, and Krazy looks into the chimney. While he does, the infant shows up from the edge of the roof, and pushes him into the flue. Krazy falls through the chimney and into the house with a waiting couple inside. Because of the diaper he's wearing, the couple mistakes him as the infant they ordered. The overjoyed wife then picks up, hugs, and smooches Krazy, much to the feline's dismay. After getting too much of the unwanted affection, Krazy removes his diaper and convinces the couple that there's a misunderstanding. Immediately, the infant he tried to deliver finally comes down the chimney and has been diapered somehow. The couple is finally please, knowing they got the correct order. Remake Years after the Krazy Kat staff had the cartoons distributed by Columbia, a remake of The Stork Exchange was released in 1931 under the title The Stork Market. The storyline of this later film is very similar to its earlier counterpart except that Krazy's spaniel girlfriend makes an appearance there.

It was originally granted to William Lockhart of Baronald Scotland in the 1700s. Today his heirs live in the Bahamas and the United States. Victor George Lockhart Captain Victor George Lockhart became the legitimate owner of this private island in the late 1960s, according to documents archived in the Supreme Court Records of the Bahamas. Sir Wallace Whitfield, Arthur Hanna and Alexander Maillis, Sr, were the principal lawyers in making Lockhart one of the first heirs of the Loyalists to the King of England to actually claim and receive ownership of their granted lands. Captain Lockhart died at the age of 99 in 2008. He had worked as a skipper on yachts, traveling the world for Richard Bertram yacht Building, Mr. Kenneth S. Van Strum of California, and the Rockefellers. He also worked on the James Bond movie shot in the Bahamas, (Thunderball), starring Sean Connery. Lockhart spoke Creole, Spanish and English. His mother was Mazorian Lockhart, n√©e Munroe. Born in 1874, she lived until 1975 Mothers Day (101 years). Today his heirs, the Lockharts, own the island in the Bahamas. At various times offers to purchase the island for over 25 million dollars have been offered for the Cay, yet it remains in the family. Captain Lockhart was also one of the founding members of the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) with the likes of H. M. Taylor; he was very close with Governor General Arthur D. Hanna and Sir Lynden Pindling. When Lockhart was a boy his family home was visited on many occasions by Sir Clement T. Maynard, Sir Clifford Darling, Doris Johnson, during the struggle for Majority Rule and Bahamian Independence. Lockhart was one of the most influential members of the Mail Boat Service in the Bahamas, as captain of the famed Alice Mabel. A song, \\"The Mail\\", written by Ronnie Butler, described the importance of his work with the Bahamas Family Islands. Lockhart also worked for Shell Oil Company, sailing \\"The Bahamas Shell and the Coral Shell\\". He established the Bahama Boat Company, which partnered with Muhammad Ali and famous Bahamian actor Calvin Lockhart to supply lobster and fish for the religious organizations within the United States. Captain Lockhart was also instrumental in bringing Pineapple Slips from Cuba for the Bahamas government secretly from Fidel Castro in the early 1960s at the request of Sir Stafford Sands and the United Bahamian Party. Lockhart on numerous occasions was invited to Haiti by Jean-Claude Duvalier (\\"Papa Doc\\") and was instrumental during Castro's revolt against Batista in feeding what was known as the rebels in Cuba from Ragged Island and Inagua in the Bahamas. Captain Lockhart led an adventurous and exciting life from 1909 to 2008 between the United States, the Caribbean and the rest of the world and was a well traveled merchant marine.

Like the Terminal Warehouse Central Stores Building on the next block uptown, trains could be driven directly into the ground floor of the building, which included not only a rail yard, but also loading and unloading facilities for trucks, warehouse areas for storage, repackaging, redistribution, and manufacturing facilities as well as areas to display goods., p.72 The office section is above the north facade. The structural requirements for the building, which has of space, of which is rentable, necessitated innovative interior engineering. During construction, the geology of the site forced a change from the original plan of a uniform 15-story building to the current layout of a 19-story section in the middle, flanked by 9-story wing on the west, and an eastern one of 18 stories. History The building was completed in 1931 by the Starrett Corporation and the Lehigh Valley Railroad, on the site of a former freight terminal for the latter. When William A. Starrett died in 1932, the Lehigh Valley Railroad bought the building outright, but by 1933 it was a losing proposition, with a net loss that year of $300,000. A number of factors contributed to the building not being an immediate financial success. The city's construction boom of the 1920s came to a stop with the start of the Great Depression and there was less demand for the rentable space in the building; the cost of construction was more than expected, due to changes in the foundation necessitated by differing level of bedrock across the building's footprint; and competition from another terminal with considerably cheaper rates announced to be built by the Port Authority ‚Äì 111 Eighth Avenue, built in 1932 ‚Äì depressed the buyer's market further, as they waited for the new building instead of renting from Starrett‚ÄìLehigh.

Personal background  Clara Olivia Byrd was born on June 22, 1886, in Williamsburg, Virginia. She was the daughter of Charles and Malvina Carey (n√©e Braxton) Byrd. In 1905, she married William Baker, sexton of Bruton Parish Church.Gonzales, Donald J. The Rockefellers at Williamsburg: backstage with the founders, restorers, and world-renowned guests, EPM Publications, page 143, 1991. Together, they had four children. ;Education Baker earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Education from Hampton Institute and Virginia State College for Negroes, predecessor to Virginia State University.  Professional background  ;Teaching Baker began her teaching background in a one-room schoolhouse in James City County, Virginia, in 1902. In 1920, she began teaching at a public training school for African-American children. She later joined the faculty of Bruton Heights School, where she stayed until her retirement in 1952. ;Community involvement Baker was a leader in the African-American community in Williamsburg, involved in public affairs focusing on education, interracial cooperation, and advocating for the right to vote for women. In 1920, she became the first woman in Williamsburg to vote, after the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified. In 1967, she was recognized by the superintendent of schools at a tribute gathering in her honor in Williamsburg. He stated that he could \\"not remember any worthwhile community- wide effort in which Baker had not participated\\".  Honors and awards  Baker has received numerous honors from local and regional organizations for her work supporting education and civic opportunities. In 2007, she was honored by the Virginia State Library and Archives as an African American Trailblazer, which recognizes distinguished African Americans from the state of Virginia. In 2011, her life was honored in To Be Seen as an American, by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, as one of three African-American women who \\"didn't accept society's limits on what they could accomplish\\". Additional honors have included: * Meritorious Service Award ‚Äì Virginia State University Alumni Association * Alumni of the Year Award ‚Äì Virginia State University Alumni Association * Heritage Girl Scout Award for 25 years of service  Death and legacy  In 1967, Baker retired to Virginia Beach, where she continued volunteering throughout the community until her death on October 20, 1979. She is buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Williamsburg. In 1989, Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools named a Williamsburg, Virginia public elementary school in honor of Baker. Clara Byrd Baker Elementary School was opened in September 1989. The school was initially built to support 600 students. In 1992, the capacity of the school was expanded to provide educational opportunities for 800 students.

It is significant as a product because it was both the first laser printer manufactured by IBM, and the first commercially available continuous forms laser printer. The IBM 3800 was developed and manufactured in San Jose, California. Production was transferred to Tucson, Arizona in 1980. It was also manufactured in J√§rf√§lla, Sweden. The 3800 was initially positioned as a line printer replacement with additional features. Besides the much greater speed, enhancements over the line printer included: * Forms overlay ‚Äì the ability to print a predefined form along with the data, eliminating the need for preprinted forms. * Thirteen different character sets. The standard 3800 could use only one per print data set; a special feature allowed four to be used at a time. * Multiple copies printed on single-ply paper, rather than using multiple-ply paper, data could be changed or suppressed between copies. * User-defined graphic characters could be used along with standard character sets. Later the 3800 family supported Advanced Function Presentation (AFP), a page description language with features similar to Xerox Corporation's Interpress or Adobe Systems' PostScript. The 3800 attached to a mainframe system via a parallel (Bus and Tag) channel. Support for two channels was available as an option. Over 8,000 of these printers were sold. It was replaced by the IBM 3900, announced in 1990, and discontinued in 1999. Development Development began in 1969 using a project code name of Jubilee. Later, the code name was changed to Argonaut. IBM did not, however, have a xerographic printer to base the Jubilee on (all IBM printers up to this point were mechanical printers, e.g., chain, print bar, train). This meant prototyping used an IBM Copier I, which was not capable of anywhere near the product goal of 1 million pages per month. Therefore, dramatic developments were required in areas such as: paper path handling, lasers and optics, toner fusion and control electronics. First Continuous Forms laser printer There is some dispute whether the IBM 3800 was the first commercially available laser printer or whether this distinction should be held by the Xerox 1200. IBM announced the 3800 in 1975 and first shipped in 1976 while Xerox announced the 1200 in 1973 and first shipped it in late 1974. Another distinction between the two products is that the Xerox 1200 was an off-line cut-sheet laser printer, while the IBM 3800 could be used both online and offline and used continuous forms. Models There were several models of the IBM 3800 Laser Printer. 3800 Model 001 The model 001 was announced on April 15, 1975, and first shipped July 1976. It had a print resolution of 144 pels per inch (or dots per inch, pels are print elements) vertically and 180 pels per inch horizontally. It could print at 10,020 to 20,040 lines per minute depending on line density (which could range from 6 to 12 lines per inch). The model 001 was the only model that supported the tape to print feature (Feature Code 7810), where an IBM 3411/3410 or IBM 3803/3420 reel to reel tape drive could be attached to the 3800, allowing the printer to operate in an offline mode. 3800 Model 002 The model 002 was announced in 1979. It was a model 001 printer that had been modified to allow it to print kanji characters. 3800 Model 003 The model 003 was announced November 1, 1982, and, at a speed of 215 page impressions per minute, it was the fastest printer of its time. It was the first AFP printer in the 3800 line. The three main goals of the model 003 were: * Improved print resolution. The model 3 had a print resolution of 240 √ó 240 pels versus the Model 001 and 002, which had a resolution of 180 √ó 144 pels. * Improved graphics printing capability. * Reduced service costs over the model 001. To improve the resolution, a new photoconductor material had to be used in combination with a specially designed digital voltmeter and a significant redesign of the laser print head. The helium-neon laser developed for the model 001 was retained, but lenses were used to generate two printing beams that reflected off a slightly more slowly rotating mirror (the mirror in model 001 rotated at 15,300 RPM versus the model 003, which rotated at 12,700 RPM). 3800 Model 006 The model 006 was announced on January 26, 1987, and shipped later that year. It was functionally identical to the model 003 but only ran at 134 pages per minute. It could be upgraded to a model 003. 3800 Model 008 The model 008 was physically similar to a model 003 but supported double-byte character sets, which allowed kanji characters to be printed (effectively making it a replacement for the model 002). In comparison to the model 002, it could print three times more kanji characters (22,500) with significantly better print resolution.  Technological Innovations in the IBM 3800  Being the first Laser Printer produced by IBM and with no similar existing products to use as models, the IBM 3800 contained many new technological features. This is a short list of some of them:  Long Life Cleaning Brush  The cleaning brush used to clean toner from the photoconductor would wear out after one month of operation. Through a variety of improvements this was extended to four months.  Long Life Helium-Neon Laser.  By using low helium diffusion glass, IBM increased the life of the laser to 20,000 operation hours, an improvement of 10√ó over off-the-shelf products available at that time.  Long Life Hot Roll  The hot roll that fuses the toner to the page needed to operate without silicone oil (to avoid contamination) and to have an extended life, so a new elastomer material was developed as well as a multi- zone preheat platen to warm the paper to prior to fusion.  Long Life Xenon Flash Lamp  A flash lamp was used as part of the form overlay system that optionally allowed you to print a fixed form onto each page. This system used a lamp that had to pulse for only 125 Œºs. Initial life span of the lamp was only one month, but through a variety of design changes this was extended to 60 months.  Print Contrast Mark  To ensure print contrast remained consistent over time, a special control mark was printed on every page. An LED sensor would monitor this mark and this was used to control how much toner was routinely fed into the developer mix. It could also detect if the printer was producing blank pages unexpectedly.  TNF based photoconductor  The original photoconductor used by the IBM 3800 (and also by the IBM Copier, IBM Copier II and IBM 3896) was a high-sensitivity organic photoconductor for electrophotography developed by IBM. IBM developed this to avoid patent infringement wth Xerox (who used a photoconductor based on selenium). The IBM developed organic photoreceptor (OPC) used a chemical known as 2, 4, 7-trinitro-9-fluorenone, commonly referred to as TNF. The photoconductor was mainly composed of a TNF and polyvinyl carbazole resin coating on an aluminized mylar sheet and was manufactured by IBM in Lexington Kentucky. Over the course of the 1970s, health and safety concerns were raised about TNF being carcinogenic. The US Federal Department of Health and Human Services contracted the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to investigate these concerns but their report did not identify any issues. Despite this, in 1980 IBM changed its advice and required its employees to always handle it with gloves. IBM then withdrew TNF based photoconductors in late 1981 for the IBM 3800 and IBM Copier II, replacing them with a photoconductor based on chlorotiane blue and diethylaminobenzal- denyde- dithenylhydrazone (sometimes called blue coral). This material was already being used in the IBM Series III Copier and the IBM 6670 and was manufactured by IBM in Boulder Colorado. Replacement product IBM partnered with Hitachi to OEM a Hitachi-developed printer, released as the IBM 3900. It was announced October 1990 and shipped in late 1991. Other 38xx printers There were other non-impact printers in the 38xx series from IBM. IBM 3812 The IBM 3812 was one of the first office laser printers produced by IBM. The 3812 (of which there were two models, 3812-001 and 3812-002) was described as a tabletop Pageprinter. It was announced in March 1986 and operated at 12 pages per minute maximum. It was not technically a laser printer as it used a LED printhead. It was withdrawn from marketing October 1991. IBM 3816 The IBM 3816 was described as an \\"electrostatic page printer\\". It was announced in March 1989 and operated at 24 impressions per minute maximum. The 3816-01S was simplex while the 3816-01D was duplex. IBM 3820 The IBM 3820, announced in February 1985, was IBM's first AFP cut-sheet printer. The 3820 could be attached to a host mainframe system via Systems Network Architecture SNA/SDLC, or to a PC using the IBM Personal Computer Network (PCLAN) or Corvus Omninet. An entry-level 3820 sold for $29,900 (). The 3820 was an AFP printer. It operated at 20 pages per minute. It was withdrawn from marketing November 1993.  IBM 3825  The IBM 3825 was announced in 1989. It was a cut sheet, duplex, non-impact, all-points-addressable AFP page printer that operated at 58 impressions per minute It was withdrawn from marketing in 1995.  IBM 3827  The IBM 3827 was announced in 1988. It was a cut sheet, duplex, non- impact, all-points-addressable AFP page printer that operated at 92 impressions per minute. While the control unit was developed by IBM, the print engine was a Kodak 1392. It was withdrawn from marketing in 1995.  IBM 3828  The IBM 3828 was a MICR version of the 3827. It was announced October 1990. It was withdrawn from marketing in October 1999.  IBM 3829  The IBM 3829 was announced in 1993. It was a cut sheet, duplex, non-impact, all- points-addressable AFP page printer that operated at 92 impressions per minute. While the control unit was developed by IBM, the print engine was a Kodak 1392. It was withdrawn from marketing in 1997.  IBM 3835  The IBM 3835 was announced in 1988 and was an intermediate speed fanfold AFP page printer that operated at 88 impressions per minute.  IBM 3935  The IBM 3935 was announced in November 1993 and was an intermediate speed duplex capable cut sheet AFP page printer that operated at 35 impressions per minute. End of IBM's printer business In 2007 IBM formed a joint venture, InfoPrint Solutions Company, with Ricoh. The new company, headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, took over all of IBM Printing Systems Division products, including the successors to the 3800 line. In 2010 IBM divested its share and the new company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ricoh. All of its products are currently maintained by Ricoh and no longer by IBM.

The ion beam is produced from a plasma that has been confined within a volume. Ions of a particular energy are extracted, accelerated, collimated and/or focused. The ion gun is composed of an ion source, extraction grid structure and a collimation/lensing structure. The plasma can be made up of an inert or reactive gas (e.g. N+ and O+) or an easily condensable substance (e.g. C+ and B+). The plasma can be formed from molecules that contain the substance which will form the beam, in which case, these molecules must be fragmented then ionized (e.g. H and CH4 can together be fragmented and ionized to create a beam for depositing diamond-like carbon films). The ion current density (or similarly the ion flux), the ion energy spread, and the resolution of the ion beam are key factors in ion gun design. The ion current density is controlled by the ion source, the energy spread is determined primarily by the extraction grid, and the resolution is determined primarily by the optical column. The ion gun is an important component in surface science in that it provides the scientist with a means to sputter etch a surface and generate an elemental or chemical depth profile.Giannuzzi, L.A., Stevie, F.A., \\"Introduction to focused ion beams: instrumentation, theory, techniques, and practice\\", Springer (2005), p.315 Modern ion guns can produce beam energies from 10eV to more than 10keV.

Located next to the Ambl√®ve River, the power station uses its water to support a power scheme where water is pumped from a lower reservoir to one of two upper reservoirs known as Coo I and Coo II. When energy demand is high, water can be released from these reservoirs for power generation. The water then returns to the lower reservoir and the process repeats as needed. The same machines that pump the water to the upper reservoirs at a higher elevation are also used as generators. The plant was commissioned in two stages, Coo I (1969) and Coo II (1978). It is owned by Electrabel and has an installed capacity of 1,164 MW. Design and operation The lower reservoir for the power station has an elbow shape and was formed with two embankment dams, one high and the other . The maximum reservoir elevation of this reservoir is . Nestled in the hills above and west of the lower reservoir are the upper reservoirs, Coo I and Coo II. Each reservoir was formed with an earth-fill dike. Coo I and Coo II have maximum reservoir elevations of and , respectively. The active (or usable) storage of the combined upper Coo reservoirs is . The lower reservoir has the same active capacity as well. Water is transferred between the reservoirs by means of two penstocks, Coo I's being long and Coo II's at in length. The power station is located underground and contains the plant's six generators. The Coo I reservoir powers three 158 MW Francis pump turbines (FPT) with Coo II consisting of three 230 MW FPTs. The change in elevation between the two reservoirs affords a hydraulic head that varies between and , the effective head is . The plant can go from a standstill to full operation in two and half minutes and switch to pumping mode in about seven minutes. It generates about 1 million MWh annually and consumes about 20 percent more in pumping mode. The plant usually pumps during periods of low demand, such as night time, when energy is cheap which makes it profitable. Its ability to quickly adjust to power demand makes it a peaking power plant.

Early life  Reynolds was born in South Australia, Australia in 1838, the eldest of six children of William and Eleanor Pinkerton. She grew up in the Australian outback, acquiring skills such as rounding up wild cattle. Life was rough and dangerous, however, and in 1855 the family moved to New Zealand. They established a sheep farm in Tapanui, in the southern province of Otago, and lived in Dunedin.  Adult life  At the age of 17, in 1856, Reynolds married local merchant and politician William Hunter Reynolds. Shortly after, the couple went to England to recruit more settlers for Otago. On their return, they purchased a large hillside house in Dunedin, Montecillo and lived there for the next 40 years, raising a family of nine children, four daughters and three sons. Reynolds was active in a wide range of social justice causes. In the 1860s she was one of a group of Dunedin residents who lobbied for the establishment of a girls' secondary school, resulting in the opening of Otago Girls' High School in 1871. She was also active in encouraging the University of Otago to admit women students, a goal which was also realised in 1871. Reynolds also worked on projects providing welfare to poor and needy people. In the 1870s Reynolds worked with Presbyterian minister Rutherford Waddell to provide food, clothes and other welfare services to poor women and children in Dunedin. She also set up a clothing club and ran sewing lessons so that mothers could learn to make affordable clothes for their families. Reynolds devoted a large amount of time to addressing the needs of children, leading to the opening of New Zealand's first free kindergarten in 1889. She later became the president of the Dunedin Free Kindergarten Association, and oversaw the establishment of a further seven kindergartens in the city. In the 1880s and early 1890s, Reynolds was active in the women's suffrage movement and in 1892 became vice-president of an independent women's franchise league formed in Dunedin that year. Reynolds' husband died in 1899, after which Reynolds travelled to England and Europe and wrote her memoirs, published in 1929 as Pioneering in Australia and New Zealand. Reynolds died in Dunedin in 1928.

Born in Northamptonshire, England, Richardson originally served with the British Army's Royal Regiment of Artillery as a non-commissioned officer before being transferred to New Zealand to instruct artillery units there. He eventually resigned from the British Army and was commissioned an officer in New Zealand's military. He was in London at the time of the outbreak of the First World War and served in the Siege of Antwerp and the Gallipoli Campaign with the Royal Naval Division. He then transferred to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and served as its administrator in the United Kingdom. He continued to serve in the military until his retirement with the rank of major general. In March 1923, he was appointed Administrator of Western Samoa and served in this capacity for five years. Towards the end of his time in Samoa, he ineffectually dealt with increasing civil unrest in the country. Retiring in 1928, he returned to New Zealand and became involved in local body politics in Auckland until his death in 1938. Early life George Spafford Richardson was born in Northamptonshire, England, on 14 November 1868, the illegitimate son of a farmer, George Richardson, and Mary Ann Baxter. After a brief period in the workforce, he enlisted in the British Army's Royal Regiment of Artillery in 1886 for a 21-year term of engagement. Military career Richardson trained at the Shoeburyness Gunnery School before being posted to Gibraltar where he served for four years. By 1891, he was a non-commissioned officer with the rank of staff sergeant instructor in gunnery and the same year, he was seconded to the New Zealand Permanent Forces, at the time the official title for the military forces of New Zealand. He began his four-year term as a gunnery instructor in New Zealand with the rank of master gunner. Based in Wellington, he was well regarded by his superior officers. He was an innovative trainer, developing several inventions to better enable his work in instructing artillery personnel. His secondment was extended several times, a situation Richardson was comfortable with as he enjoyed life in New Zealand. He married Caroline Warren on 29 October 1892, and the couple would go on to have six children. In 1907, Richardson, still in New Zealand, completed his original term of enlistment of 21 years with the British Army. He was immediately commissioned as a captain in the New Zealand Permanent Forces, becoming its Director of Artillery. In 1911, following the reorganisation of the New Zealand Permanent Forces into the New Zealand Military Forces, Richardson was transferred to the newly established New Zealand Staff Corps, still in the rank of captain. He was promoted to major the following year and returned to the United Kingdom in order to attend the Staff College in Camberley. While he was overseas, a son, also in the New Zealand Military Forces, was killed in an accident. First World War Richardson was serving on the Imperial General Staff in London as New Zealand's representative, having taken over Colonel Alfred Robin in this capacity, when the First World War broke out. He helped in the formation of the Royal Naval Division and deployed to France in September 1914 as its chief of staff, and then as assistant adjutant and quartermaster general with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. With the division, he served in the unsuccessful defence of Antwerp, and managed to avoid being taken prisoner of war when the city fell to the Germans. Returning to England in November 1914 and still with the Royal Naval Division, Richardson helped prepare it for the Gallipoli Campaign and landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. His work as a staff officer throughout the campaign was so highly regarded that he was promoted to brigadier general and appointed deputy adjutant and quartermaster general of the British XII Corps. In October 1915, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He served in Salonika with XII Corps as part of the British Salonika Army from December 1915 to February 1916. In recognition of his service at Gallipoli and Salonika, he was awarded the Croix de Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur (Legion of Honour) in March 1916. This French award is uncommon to New Zealanders with fewer than 100 awards made, and Richardson was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the war. At the request of the New Zealand Government, in February 1916 Richardson returned to England to become the New Zealand representative at the War Office. Transferring to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), he also took responsibility for its administration. His responsibilities extended to the overall command of all NZEF personnel in the United Kingdom. This included wounded personnel receiving medical treatment, nurses and doctors, as well as soldiers undergoing training before being transferred to the front. The overall commander of the NZEF, Lieutenant General Alexander Godley, thought highly of Richardson's work and it was recognised in the June 1917 Birthday Honours with his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Shortly after the cessation of hostilities Richardson was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours. He had also been mentioned in despatches on three occasions during the course of the war. Postwar career Richardson in 1920 Richardson returned to New Zealand in February 1919 and, based in Wellington, became administrator for General Headquarters of the New Zealand Military Forces. He also chaired the Reconstruction Committee which was established to reduce the New Zealand Military Forces to a peacetime setting. However, he soon tired of this work and the following year tendered his resignation. It was not accepted by the New Zealand Government and he remained in his role until early 1923. He was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre in 1922 for his services in the First World War, and also wrote a chapter on the education of soldiers, a subject in which he was particularly interested, for one of the volumes of the Official History of New Zealand's Effort in the Great War. This was published in 1923. Western Samoa In March 1923, Richardson was appointed Administrator of Western Samoa, a former possession of Imperial Germany but now a mandate for which New Zealand was responsible on behalf of the League of Nations. This effectively ended his military career but not before he received a final promotion to major general. Richardson met with some initial success in his new role, learning Samoan and implementing a number of reforms. He focussed on transforming the country's economy into one based upon agriculture with a long-term view of Samoan self- governance, and also implemented welfare and educational programs. His results were such that his term of three years in Western Samoa was extended by a further two years. He was also knighted, being made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the June 1925 Birthday Honours. However, over the next two years he had to deal with the increasing influence of the Mau movement, a nationalist group agitating for independence via peaceful means. While his administrative experience was helpful for carrying the reforms he had initiated, he lacked the political and diplomatic skills to deal with the Mau. He took a heavy-handed approach to asserting his authority and deported several leaders of the Mau. This did not have the desired effect and dissent amongst the general population towards the New Zealand administration only increased. Richardson was forced to call in marines from the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy to deal with the civil unrest. Shortly afterwards, on 31 March 1928, he retired. Later in the year, he was the New Zealand representative to the League of Nations meeting which discussed the administration of Western Samoa. Later life Retiring to the city of Auckland, he was an advocate for returned servicemen, particularly those who were disabled, but became involved with local body politics and became a member of the Auckland City Council (ACC) at the 1935 local elections. Voted again onto the ACC after the next local election in May 1938, he was appointed the Deputy Mayor of Auckland. He died suddenly on 11 June 1938, and was buried at Waikumete Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and five children. Auckland City Council unveiled a memorial plaque for Richardson in the foyer of the Auckland Town Hall on 30 March 1939.

Some individual characters appear in all three works, while others appear in only one or two of the works. The given names of the novel's main characters remain the same for the 2008 film, but are anglicized for the 2010 film. Most of the characters were created by Lindqvist. Main characters Oskar Eriksson / Owen Oskar Eriksson is the name of the main protagonist in both the novel and the 2008 Swedish-language film Let the Right One In, while Owen is the name given to this character in the 2010 English-language film Let Me In. In all three works, the character is a 12-year-old boy living with his single mother in a dreary housing estate during the early 1980s. He resides in Blackeberg, Stockholm, Sweden in both the novel and original film, and in Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States in the 2010 film. Initially, Oskar/Owen is a loner. One of the few friends he has is Tommy, who is a major character in the book, but is omitted from both films save one fleeting mention by Owen in Let Me In. Oskar/Owen is constantly harassed in school by a group of bullies that enjoy torturing and humiliating him, and he fantasizes of one day standing up for himself and injuring or disposing of them. As a result of these experiences, he is initially defensive when he first meets Eli/Abby. The two eventually form a close bond when she notices he is playing with a Rubik's cube, and, because of her fondness for puzzles, Eli/Abby's interest is piqued. After a particularly bad experience with the bullies, Eli/Abby advises Oskar/Owen that he needs to stand up for himself, and offers him words of encouragement, as well as support if he needs it. In the end, Oskar joins Eli in her nomadic existence, and eventually, in the sequel short story \\"Let the Old Dreams Die\\", he allows himself to be infected with vampirism, thus joining Eli as a hunter of the night.Lindqvist, John Ajvide: \\"Let the old dreams die\\". Let the Old Dreams Die and Other Stories (english edition), pp. 237-267. Translation by Marlaine Delargy. Quercus, London (2012). Oskar has a closer relationship with his mother in the novel and 2008 film than Owen does in Let Me In. In the novel and original film, Oskar's mother is caring, loving and spends time with him. In the 2010 film, Owen's mother is a neglectful Christian alcoholic and her face is never shown, which might explain why he is drawn to Abby. This is comparable to Oskar's father in the novel and original film, who is also an alcoholic and neglectful of Oskar when he visits on weekends. Owen's father is never seen in Let Me In, his voice is heard once during a conversation with Owen on the telephone, where he seems very caring and concerned about Owen living with his mother. Eli / Abby Eli, originally known as Elias (male), is the name of the centuries-old child vampire in both the novel and original film Let the Right One In, renamed Abby for the 2010 film Let Me In. When Eli/Abby moves into the apartment nextdoor to Oskar/Owen, the two characters become very close friends. Eli/Abby requires the consumption of human blood to live, and cannot eat or drink anything else without vomiting it out. Her hunger is shown to take a severe physical toll on her. As Eli/Abby is immune to the cold and the snow, she is sometimes barefoot when she goes out which makes climbing things like walls and trees easy for her. The character also cannot be exposed to the Sun without being burned up to the eventual point of bursting into flames, and cannot enter the home or room of an individual unless there is verbal permission given by that individual to do so (i.e. \\"you can come in\\") or the character will bleed profusely (to death if not invited in). This, along with a metaphorical allusion to \\"letting someone into\\" one's life, is the basis for the titles Let the Right One In and Let Me In. In the original film, the child Eli was portrayed by one actress while another actress provided the character's voice. The elderly Eli was played by a third actress. H√•kan / Thomas H√•kan is a middle-aged male that lives and travels with Eli in the novel and 2008 film Let the Right One In. His counterpart's name in Let Me In is not revealed, and he is credited as simply \\"The Father\\", although a later comic series based on the 2010 film names him Thomas. H√•kan is a pedophile in the book, with pertaining activities detailed explicitly. He first met Eli when he was already an adult. While the character of the same name in the 2008 film is assumed to have similar characteristics, any details surrounding his potential pedophilia or history with Eli are not revealed, only hinted upon in their dialogue and a few scenes. The comparable character in Let Me In is heavily implied to not be a pedophile, and having instead met and possibly been with Abby since he was a young child, and it is implied that he acts more as a protective \\"father\\" figure to Abby in his old age, rather than as a lover. Within the film plots, H√•kan is used as a foreshadowing of what Oskar / Owen will eventually become, while the sequel short story \\"Let the Old Dreams Die\\" features a different outcome. Secondary characters Lacke Lacke is a local middle-aged male resident of Blackeberg whose story and group of friends play a major role in both the novel and the 2008 film Let the Right One In, where he eventually becomes an antagonist to the main characters. Lacke is completely omitted from the 2010 film Let Me In, and is replaced by an unnamed authority figure credited as \\"The Policeman\\". Lacke is an alcoholic who has a strained relationship with his girlfriend Virginia. He spends a lot of time with his friends Morgan, Jocke and Larry at a local bar, which is where he first meets H√•kan. Lacke first becomes involved in the main storyline when his friend Jocke disappears after Eli attacks him for blood, an event that is witnessed by G√∂sta, one of the townspeople. When Jocke's dead body is found and it is revealed that Eli must have killed him, Lacke is determined to investigate the situation. Virginia Virginia in the novel and original Swedish film is a middle-aged woman who is the on- again/off-again girlfriend of major secondary character Lacke. A much more youthful and physically attractive character of the same name appears in Let Me In (2010), and she and her boyfriend (named \\"Larry\\" after a different character in the original) play a much smaller role in the story. She is the only character besides Jimmy whose name is the same in all versions. In the novel and original film, Virginia is very weary of Lacke's alcoholism, and is on the verge of breaking it off with him permanently because of it. Tommy * Created by: John Ajvide Lindqvist Tommy is a young rebellious boy who is described as Oskar/Owen's only friend other than Eli/Abby. His story is a significant part of the novel's narrative, but he is completely absent from the 2008 film, and is only mentioned by Owen once in the 2010 film, where he is not seen. Tommy lives with his mother Yvonne and her policeman boyfriend Staffan (not to be confused with \\"The Policeman\\" from Let Me In), with whom he has a very strained relationship. He also has an older brother that is seldom around anymore. \\"The WillyMan\\" * Created by: Matt Reeves * Portrayed by: Elias Koteas (2010) \\"The WillyMan\\" is the credited namesake of a middle-aged, balding authority figure (possibly a detective) in the 2010 film Let Me In who effectively replaces the character of Lacke and other townspeople from the novel and original film. Unlike Lacke, \\"The Policeman\\" has no personal interest in bringing justice to those responsible for attacking the townspeople; he is merely responsible for doing so. He is the first major character that is seen on-screen in Let Me In, and serves alongside Owen's bullies as the main antagonist of the film. Jonny/Conny/Kenny * Portrayed by: Patrik Rydmark (2008 film), Dylan Minnette (2010 film) Owen/Oskar's bully and antagonist in all versions of the story. He sadistically attacks Owen/Oskar every chance he gets. He never relents until Owen/Oskar stands up for himself. He is the leader of a posse of bullies, who is seen doing acts such as beating Owen/Oskar with an antenna rod (a light tree branch in the novel), in the 2010 film, he is seen trying to pull off a girl's bathing suit in a public swimming pool, and even willing to kill Owen/Oskar. In the film version, when Owen/Oskar stands up for himself, he splits Jonny/Kenny/Conny's ear open with a metal pole when he was threatened to be thrown into the icy pond, but in the original novel, Oskar placed his mitten on Jonny's ear. The bullies take actions further by attacking Oskar at the train station and threaten to throw him into oncoming an train causing Oskar to set fire to a photo of Jonny's father and accidentally setting fire to the rest of the students' desks. In spite of this, Jonny/Conny/Kenny later decides to retaliate with his brother Jimmy. They set fire outside of the community pool to lure out the gym teacher (in the novel, Jimmy's friends knock the teacher unconscious with blunt force) and scare everybody else out. They threaten to drown Owen/Oskar, but in the midst of this, they are attacked by Eli/Abby, who kills all the bullies in the American film, all except for Andreas in the Swedish film, and only Jonny and Jimmy in the novel. Jimmy * Portrayed by: Ramus Luthander (2008 film), Brett DelBuono (2010 film) The older brother of Jonny/Conny/Kenny and antagonist in all versions. He is shown to be more sadistic than his younger brother and just as much a bully. He shows up in the story after Oskar/Owen stands up to him. He openly treats his brother poorly but he decides to help him and his friends retaliate against Oskar/Owen. His role becomes important at the climax of the story; he sets a fire outside of the community pool and scares the students out. In the 2010 film, he steals a knife that Owen threatened him with when he made a run for it, but in the novel and 2008 film he had a knife of his own. Jimmy tells Oskar/Owen that if he can hold his breath for three minutes, he'll give him a little cut, and if not, then he will carve out his eye. As he begins to drown Oskar/Owen, Eli/Abby arrives and slaughters the bullies, Jimmy was the first to die in the American film as his head was ripped off and thrown in the water. He is the only character besides Virginia to keep their name in all versions. Jimmy is well known to often have hiccups in the novel; however, this is not shown in the film.

Middle Ages The Middle Ages is generally counted as covering Europe from the 5th to 15th centuries. Under Islam During the Middle Ages many polemical texts originated outside Catholic Europe in lands where Jews and Christians were on an even footing as subjects of Islam. Among the oldest anti-Christian texts with polemic intent is the Toledot Yeshu \\"Life of Jesus\\" (7th century), although this does not follow the reasoned format of argument found in a true polemic or apologetic work. The earliest true polemic is the Sefer Nestor Ha- Komer \\"The Book of Nestor the Priest\\" (c. 600 CE).Joel E. Rembaum, The Influence of \\"Sefer Nestor Hakomer\\" on Medieval Jewish Polemics, in: Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 45, (1978) The book represents itself as the arguments for Judaism of a former Christian (possibly Nestorian) priest.Daniel J.

Biography Simpson was born to Thomas Overton and his wife (name unknown) in England in about 1821. By the age of 20, she had married blacksmith Joseph Simpson (on Christmas Eve 1839) and had a daughter (Elizabeth, born 1841 or '42). In 1850, the family emigrated to Lyttelton, New Zealand on the Charlotte Jane. The Simpsons were initially employed by Charles and Georgina Bowen, however they soon left the Bowens and obtained work in the town of Lyttelton as they could earn higher wages there. Simpson became the sole nurse at Lyttelton Hospital in 1856, and Joseph found work in the town. He later travelled to the first Australian gold rush but did not return, and probably died in Victoria. During Simpson's tenure at Lyttelton Hospital, the population of the town increased significantly and the hospital was frequently overcrowded. She dealt with local patients as well as patients from ships in port, and was responsible for all patient care, meals, and cleaning, with the assistance of only one servant. In 1859, Simpson took charge of a family of five children who had arrived on the Clontarf; their mother and two of their siblings had died on the voyage, and their mother had given birth to a stillborn baby. Their father, James Berry, died soon after arrival in Lyttelton, and the children were permitted to stay at the hospital with Simpson. When she left the hospital in 1862, on her marriage to Captain David Ritchie, the Berry children moved with her to their new home. In 1864, Simpson was appointed matron of the Christchurch Female Home. The Home had been established by the visiting Maria Rye and the Female Middle Class Emigration Society, which aimed to recruit women in England to go to the colonies as governesses, arrange their passages and find them positions on arrival. However there was concern for the ongoing well-being of these women as they had no family in the colonies. Therefore the Female Home played a key role in providing a safe home for them during periods of unemployment or convalescence, and also served as an employment bureau for local families seeking to hire a governess. During the first year of operating the home, Simpson registered 190 employers, and 320 women were employed. The following year, 218 women stayed at the home and 288 servants were employed, although over 540 families had applied to hire them. The home was moved to a new location and expanded to accommodate invalid servants from rural areas. Simpson left her position at the home in 1867 and set up a dressmaking business in 1877. Her husband was lost at sea during a voyage from Lyttelton to Wellington, however it is not known when this happened. She died on 30 September 1907.

The tower was developed by CIM Group and Harry B. Macklowe and designed by Rafael Vi√±oly. It features 125 condominiums as well as amenities such as a private restaurant for residents. 432 Park Avenue sits on Billionaires' Row and has some of the most expensive residences in the city, with the median unit selling for tens of millions of dollars. 432 Park Avenue is located on the site of the former Drake Hotel, which was sold to Macklowe in 2006. The project faced delays for five years because of lack of financing as well as difficulties in acquiring the properties on the site. Construction plans were approved for 432 Park Avenue in 2011 and excavations began the next year. Sales within 432 Park Avenue were launched in 2013; the building topped out during October 2014 and was officially completed in 2015. The structure includes seven 12-story-tall segments with residential units. Each segment is separated by a two-story-tall section without any windows or interior space, allowing wind gusts to pass through the building. At the time of its completion, 432 Park Avenue was the third-tallest building in the United States and the tallest residential building in the world. , it is the thirty-first tallest building in the world, sixth-tallest building in the United States, the fifth-tallest building in New York City, and the third-tallest residential building in the world. History Macklowe acquisition and financial crisis The 21-story, 495-room Drake Hotel had been constructed in 1926 at the corner of Park Avenue and 56th Street. In January 2006, the hotel's owner, Host Hotels & Resorts, was intending to sell the property \\"in the mid-$400 million range\\", primarily marketing the site with the prospect of replacing the aging hotel with a mixed-use skyscraper. Developer Harry Macklowe purchased the Drake in 2006 for $418 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Following his acquisition of the hotel, Macklowe paid French delicatessen company Fauchon $4 million to shorten the terms of their lease on the ground floor of the Drake Hotel and vacate in April 2007 instead of 2016. Shortly after the agreement was reached, Fauchon sued Macklowe in New York Supreme Court claiming that the developer was harassing the store to leave by blocking their entrance with scaffolding and threatening to cut off air conditioning and access to the hotel's bathrooms. In April 2007, Macklowe purchased the Buccellati store at 46 East 57th Street for $47.5 million. This followed Macklowe's purchase of the Audemars Piguet store at 40 East 57th Street for $19.2 million, the Franck Muller store at 38 East 57th Street for $60 million, as well as 44 and 50 East 57th Street for $41 million. Following over 14 months of negotiations, Macklowe also had to pay Audemars Piguet $16.6 million to end their lease early and move across the street to 137 East 57th Street. The total cost of additional nearby parcels and air rights brought the acquisition cost to over $724 million and yielded a large L-shaped site between 56th and 57th Streets. In early 2007, Macklowe Properties secured a $543 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank on the site. Macklowe was said to be planning a 65-story Armani-branded tower that would consist of three stories of retail, offices until the 20th floor, topped by a 10-story hotel and 33 floors of residential space. Additionally, Nordstrom had signed a letter of intent to open their first New York store, a flagship, at the building's base. Macklowe had been in contract to purchase the Turnbull & Asser storefront at 42 East 57th Street for $33 million but the company's owner executed a call option in the store's lease to allow him to buy the building for $31.5 million instead. Jacob & Co's founder Jacob Arabo also demanded $100 million for the store's building at 50 East 57th Street, a price Macklowe was unable to pay. These holdouts meant Macklowe was unable to connect the other buildings he owned on East 57th Street, depriving Nordstrom of the space needed for the store's ground floor entrance. Nordstrom also reportedly required a ceiling, which was not feasible at the site. This caused Nordstrom to back out of the deal and instead open their flagship in Central Park Tower several blocks west on 57th Street. In October 2007, the New York City Department of Buildings issued demolition permits for the site; at the time, the demolition cost was estimated at $6 million, or roughly . During the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, Macklowe defaulted on the Deutsche Bank loan which was due in November 2007. In October 2007, Harry Macklowe personally repaid $156.3 million of Macklowe Property's debt on the site, bringing his personal investment in the project to over $250 million. The repayment included $38 million of mezzanine loans with a 15% interest rate that were held by Vornado Realty Trust. In May 2008, hotelier Kirk Kerkorian and investment company Dubai World reportedly considered purchasing the site for $200 million in addition to assuming the existing debt on the property. The bank sued in August 2008 to begin foreclosure on the loan (which had amortized down to $482 million at the time) and take control of the development site. Deutsche Bank had divided the loan into 21 tranches and sold much of the debt to ten different investors including Highland Capital Management and Sorin Capital Management, earning tens of millions of dollars in fees. The bank retained just $12 million of the loan on its own balance sheet. During the height of the recession in November 2008, one of the investors, iStar Financial, was unable to find any buyers for its $224 million tranche of the debt for $160 million, representing just over 71 cents on the dollar. Initially, over 20 bidders were believed to be interested including Apollo Global Management, The Related Companies, and Silverstein Properties. Only a half-dozen bidders eventually offered between $100 million and roughly $130 million, or 45 and 58 cents on the dollar respectively. Paul Manafort and CMZ Ventures Seen from ground level In late 2007, Joseph Sitt, founder of Thor Equities, introduced Macklowe to an investment firm named CMZ Ventures. The letters \\"CMZ\\" represented Arthur G. Cohen, a New York real estate developer; Paul Manafort, a former lobbyist, political consultant, and lawyer; and Brad Zackson, a frequent partner of Manafort and Fred Trump. In 2008, CMZ Ventures agreed to pay $850 million for the development site which would fully pay off the Deutsche Bank loan and represent a small profit on top of Macklowe's total acquisition price. In fact, the purchase price was higher even than the appraised value of $780 million, a premium of over 10% which was unheard of for development site purchases. The partners wanted to build a 65-story building with a Bulgari-branded luxury hotel, condominiums, a private club, and a vertical mall. In late 2008, Dmytro Firtash, a Ukrainian natural gas oligarch and alleged associate of Russian organized crime, agreed to fund $112 million in equity and paid Manafort a deposit of $25 million. The deposit was wired from a Raiffeisen Zentralbank account that U.S. officials alleged was a front for Russian organized crime \\"boss of bosses\\" Semion Mogilevich. Manafort had met Firtash while consulting for the pro-Russia Party of Regions, at the time the ruling political party in Ukraine. French fund Inovalis also agreed to arrange another $500 million of equity for the project from various backers. Ultimately, the bid fell apart when CMZ could not arrange the necessary financing. In 2011, the former pro-European Union prime minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko, alleged in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York that Firtash violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Specifically, Tymoshenko stated that Firtash had used CMZ as a front organization for funds that he skimmed unlawfully from RosUkrEnergo, the natural gas company that he jointly controlled with Russian state-owned enterprise Gazprom. Tymoshenko also alleged that Firtash planned to use the money for political purposes, rather than as a real estate investment; specifically, she claimed that the money would go to help her opponent, Victor Yanukovych, a pro-Russia politician who became Ukraine's president in 2010. Another CMZ Ventures investor was Oleg Deripaska, a sanctioned Russian oligarch and leader of the world's second-largest aluminum company Rusal. Deripaska agreed to invest $56 million into 432 Park Avenue through an investment fund named Pericles which was managed by Rick Gates, a Manafort partner who has since pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. CIM Group investment In January 2010, developer CIM Group agreed to pay $305 million for the complete development site including 434 Park Avenue and 38, 40, 44 and 50 East 57th Street while keeping Macklowe involved as a partner. The investment by CIM allowed Macklowe to repay the senior-most tranche 90 cents on the dollar while the junior-most tranches were completely wiped out. At the time, the site was considered one of New York's most valuable due to its location between East 56th and 57th Streets on the west side of Park Avenue. Citigroup's private banking arm raised an additional $415 million in equity for the project from high-net-worth individuals who invested $1 million to $5 million each. Another $100 million in equity came from CIM's existing institutional investor clients. Following the investment, CIM continued to expand the development site, purchasing 46 East 57th Street for $42.5 million in January 2011. CIM and Macklowe were sued by Franck Muller in September 2010 after the company tried to evict the watch retailer from their space at 38 East 57th Street that Macklowe had purchased several years earlier for over $60 million. The building was master-leased to a real estate investment company, Sovereign Partners, who in turn had subleased the ground floor and mezzanine space to Franck Muller until 2018. CIM and Macklowe had purchased that master lease for $5.35 million in November 2008, making a CIM-owned company Franck Muller's new landlord. Subsequently, CIM and Macklowe had the building reappraised by Cushman & Wakefield who determined that the fair market rent for the space was $1.4 million per year, higher than the rent initially agreed to by Sovereign Partners. However, the CIM-owned company that had purchased Sovereign Partner's lease failed to pay this increased rent, leading to an event of default under the lease and allowing CIM and Macklowe to begin the eviction process. Franck Muller objected, claiming that CIM was essentially choosing not to pay itself the increased rent and manufacturing an excuse to evict the CIM-owned master lessee and in turn Frank Muller, the sublessee. In October, a New York Supreme Court ordered the case be determined through arbitration instead. The developers received a $30 million mortgage from Pacific Northwestern Bank on the site in early April 2011. Later that month, CIM filed dummy permits for a 5-story office building in order to begin excavation work on the site and by the following month had hired Rafael Vi√±oly to design the new tower. Macklowe, speaking at a real estate conference in New York, claimed the building would be \\"monumental\\" and a \\"capstone\\" to his career. In October, plans were revealed for a tall condominium tower on the site using the address 432 Park Avenue. Previously, CIM had reportedly considered using the building's lower floors as a luxury hotel similar to nearby One57 and spoken to operators including Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, Taj Hotels, and One&Only; Resorts. The next month, CIM purchased Turnbull & Asser's storefront at 42 East 57th Street for $32.4 million and concurrently sold the nearby 50 East 57th Street to the clothier for $31.5 million, allowing CIM to expand their development site and Turnbull & Asser to remain on the same block. In December 2011, LVMH reportedly considered investing in the site for an expansion of the company's \\"Cheval Blanc\\" luxury hotel chain, creating a campus with the company's nearby LVMH Tower. Construction Excavation for the building's foundations began in early 2012. In March, CIM filed plans for the full building, revealing its 82-story, height. The New York City Department of Buildings issued the construction permit two months later. By September 2012, the building's concrete foundation had been completed and the tower crane had been installed. The building passed street level by the end of the year. As construction progressed, 432 Park's developers raised asking prices for the building's units several times. A brochure in June 2012 indicated that units would cost , but that rate had increased to by September 2012. By March 2013, asking prices had reached . The project's second crane was installed in early 2012. In October 2012, the development also received $400 million in construction financing from hedge fund The Children's Investment Fund Management. The construction loan carried a low loan-to-value ratio of under 40% but an unusually high interest rate of over 10% per year. However, the loan was also nonrecourse meaning that the lender could not go after CIM or Macklowe's other assets if they defaulted on the construction loan. Construction was temporarily halted in February 2013 after crews damaged a neighboring building and the Department of Buildings gave the project several safety violations. Though work resumed within the month, a worker was injured in an on-site construction accident that March, when a piece of wood dropped from the fifth floor. In mid-2013, developers filed a revision to the plan to add another floor. This was achieved by converting the formerly double-height 95th floor into two separate stories of standard height. Also in March, sales officially launched from an office at the nearby General Motors Building, with units being listed at between $20 million to $82.5 million apiece. At the time, the developers claimed more than a third of the building's units were already under contract. To assist with marketing, Macklowe spent $1 million on a four-minute film that would air exclusively in the sales center. The film, directed by Danny Forster and filmed at Silvercup Studios, follows a young woman leaving her English country house in a 1957 Rolls-Royce and taking a Learjet to her new home at 432 Park Avenue. The film also featured famed French high-wire artist Philippe Petit dangling from a helicopter, music by Cass Elliot, references to Mies van der Rohe‚Äôs Barcelona Pavilion and the Pantheon, and depictions of King Kong, Le Corbusier, Al Capone, and Anna May Wong. 432 Park Avenue passed the mark in June 2014. The topping out ceremony was held on October 10, 2014, signifying that the building had reached its maximum height. 432 Park Avenue was nearly completed in January 2015 when work was temporarily halted again after another construction accident. In November 2015, Macklowe added a team from brokerage Douglas Elliman to supplement the developer's internal sales team tasked with selling the tower's units. By early 2016, several websites reported that 432 Park had been officially completed on December 23, 2015. Post-opening Top of 432 Park, following its completion In June 2016, Macklowe Properties agreed to pay $411.1 million to acquire the building's retail component from CIM. Several months later, it was announced that boutique watch store Richard Mille would occupy part of the ground-floor retail space. The , two-story store opened in October 2018. At the time, Richard Mille was the only retail tenant. Two months later, auction house Phillips signed a contract for retail space, consisting of at the base of the building, as well as underground, with plans to move into the space in May 2020. By the end of 2018, John Barrett also agreed to open a salon on the building's second floor and boutique perfumery Amaffi leased on the ground floor. Joanne Podell, broker for Cushman & Wakefield, stated in 2019 that she had to promise lower rents in order to attract retail tenants. In 2016, Linda Macklowe filed for divorce from Harry Macklowe. As part of the divorce proceedings, she filed a lawsuit in September 2017 claiming that Harry illegally shrunk a condo on the building's 78th floor that Linda had agreed to purchase for $14.4 million. The couple initially agreed to purchase \\"his and hers\\" condominiums on the 78th floor in 2013, with Linda occupying the smaller \\"A\\" unit and Harry purchasing the larger \\"B\\" unit. After paying a deposit of $2.2 million, Linda claimed that the developers delayed closing four times and shrunk her unit from to , giving the additional space to Harry's neighboring \\"B\\" unit. The divorce court judge ordered the tower's developers to give Linda until December 21, 2017, to decide whether to purchase the downsized unit. Linda instead chose to remain at the couple's penthouse in the nearby Plaza Hotel and dropped her lawsuit over the unit's shrinkage in exchange for the return of her $2.2 million deposit. The divorce trial also revealed that Macklowe earned just $2.5 million from his investment in 432 Park Avenue and held only a $15.7 million equity stake in the retail portion of the development. Following his subsequent marriage to Patricia Landeau, Macklowe installed a portrait of the couple taken by Studio Harcourt on the northwest corner of the tower's retail space in March 2019. The wedding's 200-person reception took place on the building's 78th floor in a condo that was turned into a temporary ballroom. The building hosted an event for theater director Robert Wilson's Watermill Center as part of the Park Avenue Armory's \\"Armory Week\\" of art sales in January 2018. The event, attended by Macklowe, Zac Posen, and Claude Grunitzky, made headlines for employing multiple nude performers in a departure from the more classically focused events of Armory Week which centered on 18th and 19th century art.  Design  The design of the structure was conceived by architect Rafael Vi√±oly, who was inspired by a trash can designed in 1905 by Austrian designer Josef Hoffmann. The metal trash can's grid-like pattern is replicated in the tower's facade. The tower has 85 occupiable stories, which consist of a mezzanine and 84 numbered floors. Above the base, each story has an area of . The tower is divided into six groups of 12 floors by five double-height mechanical spaces which are unenclosed to reduce the tower's wind load. The floor numbering system includes mechanical levels located near the bottom of the tower, and as a result, the top story is numbered as the 96th. The facade features a regular grid of apertures, giving each occupiable floor six windows on each face, and each double-height mechanical area with twelve openings per face. The interiors are designed by Deborah Berke and the firm Bentel & Bentel, which also designed Eleven Madison Park and the Gramercy Tavern. Berke's design brief was simply ‚Äúno set budget, make it look fantastic‚Äù. Height and slenderness Tallest buildings in New York City by pinnacle height. 432 Park Avenue is third from the left When 432 Park Avenue officially topped out at , it became the second-tallest building in New York City after One World Trade Center and the fifteenth-tallest building in the world. By roof height, 432 Park is the tallest building in the city , as it surpasses the rooftop of One World Trade Center. It surpassed 311 South Wacker as the tallest building in the world known only by its street address. The building is so tall, even compared to others in New York City, that its construction required approval from Federal Aviation Administration. Upon 432 Park's completion, media outlets said that it was the hundredth supertall skyscraper ever built. , 432 Park Avenue is the sixth-tallest building in the United States, the fifth-tallest building in New York City, and the third-tallest residential building in the world when topped-out buildings are included. The tower sits in the middle of the block bounded by East 56th Street, Madison Avenue, East 57th Street, and Park Avenue. Its base is L-shaped, with an annex extending east to 56th Street and Park Avenue. The tower has a frontage of on Park Avenue, though its main entrance is on 56th Street. The building's -tall base covers most of the lot. The tower has floors that are arranged as a square with sides, giving each floor a usable area of . With a height-to-width ratio of 15:1, 432 Park has one of the greatest height-to-width ratios of any skyscraper in the world. About a quarter of the building's floors are devoted to structural and mechanical equipment, which do not count toward total floor size. These floors were built under a zoning loophole used to make buildings taller without exceeding floor area ratio zoning limitations. Apartments and amenities The finalized plans called for 147 apartments in total: 122 luxury condominium units of one to six bedrooms between the 34th and 96th floors, and 25 studio units on the 28th and 29th floors. The 91st through 96th floors contain the penthouse units, whose layouts differ from those of the units on the floors below. The tower's condominium units feature -high ceilings. The smallest unit is a studio, while the largest unit is the , six- bedroom, seven-bath penthouse on the 96th floor, with its own library. A sample medium-sized unit, #35B, covers with three bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths, facing south and west with views of Central Park. Macklowe initially placed thick frames on some of the windows, as he wanted to highlight the views of Central Park, but some tenants removed these frames because they took up interior space. The building's amenities include ceilings, golf training facilities, and private dining and screening rooms. On the 12th floor is an private restaurant with a private terrace, which has been led by Michelin- starred chef Shaun Hergatt . The 12th through 16th floors comprise a \\"club unit\\" with a fitness center; a swimming complex with a pool, whirlpool, sauna, and steam room; private meeting rooms, including a 14-seat boardroom; and a library curated by Assouline Publishing. Engineering alt=The structure of the tower is composed of a square, reinforced concrete core with walls, which the engineer, Silvian Marcus, describes as \\"like the backbone of a body.\\" This core houses the elevator shafts and all the building's mechanical services. The outer \\"shell\\" is composed of a grid of -wide columns, as well as exterior horizontal spandrels of reinforced concrete that encloses the symmetric \\"basket grid\\" of window openings. The facade was poured in place from concrete, using white Portland cement that could withstand pressure of up to , and cast around pre-assembled full-floor cages of #20 rebars with articulated steel forms. The formed surface was left as the final finish without any added fascia. The distance between the core and the facade is on all sides. To support its thin orthogonal frame, 432 Park Avenue features larger columns at its base than on the upper floors. The columns are about deep at the bottom of the tower, narrowing to at the top. This layout maximizes the available interior space between the core and shell. The floor-to-floor height of each of the 85 occupied stories is , with -thick floor slabs. To dampen the acceleration from wind loads, upper floors have slabs up to thick to add more mass. In another measure to reduce the potentially uncomfortable effects of swaying due to wind vortex loading on such a flexible tower, 432 Park is divided into seven segments, each with 12 occupied floors. Between each segment is a two-story-tall section without any windows or interior space, allowing wind gusts to pass through rather than around the building. These floors also contain modular mechanical services for the six floors above and below to reduce the number of ducts needed. To mitigate swaying even further, two tuned mass dampers are also located at the top of the tower, and several dampers are located in the outriggers of some of the mechanical floors.  Residents  As early as 2012, a dozen potential clients were described as being interested in occupying units at 432 Park, and by the next year, tenants had signed contracts for over a third of the units. The following year, that proportion had risen above 50%, with all of the tenants collectively paying an estimated $1 billion. By the end of 2015, close to 90% of the apartments had been sold, with almost half of those owned by a foreign citizen, \\"part of a global elite that collects residences like art.\\" Many of the buyers were wealthy Chinese, though there were also numerous Brazilian and Russian clients. The German newspaper Der Spiegel estimated that the majority of the units would remain unoccupied for more than ten months a year. Notable residents include Lewis A. Sanders, Bennett LeBow, Ye Jianming, David Chu, Hely Nahmad, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex Rodriguez. Other wealthy residents include Bridgewater Associates executive Bob Prince and Douglas Elliman owner Howard Lorber.  Apartment selling prices  Seen from 30 Rockefeller Plaza in 2016 In 2016, 81 of the 104 units were sold at a median price of $18.4 million; by the following year, the remaining unsold units were put for sale at prices between $6.5 and $82 million. The first sale to be completed was that of apartment #35B, which was reported in January 2016 for $18.116 million, more than the $17.75 million asking price. Ten additional apartments were available at that time, ranging from $17.4 to $44.25 million. The median penthouse units were more expensive than the other units. Two penthouses labeled as being on the 91st floor were sold for $60 million in 2018 to Caryl Schechter, the wife of hedge-fund manager Israel Englander, while three penthouse units on the 92nd and 93rd floors were sold in 2017 for a combined $91 million. The 94th-floor penthouse was sold for $32.4 million in 2019, about 25% lower than the original asking price. The 95th-floor penthouse, originally listed for $82 million, was split in half in 2018 and the individual units were sold at $30 million. The top floor unit, labeled as the 96th floor, was listed at $95 million but actually sold to Saudi businessman Fawaz Alhokair for $88 million in 2016. The sale of all of the units was expected to bring in $3.1 billion in profit, the highest of any building in New York City. Reception Completed in 2016, seen from a distance The skyscraper has received mixed reviews from both professionals and the public. 432 Park's slenderness and simplicity have been the subject of both praise and criticism. For example, Jonathan Margolis of the Financial Times said, \\"I have become obsessed by the almost childlike simplicity of 432 Park Ave\\". Aaron Betsky of Architect magazine called 432 Park \\"a gridded tube abstracting and punctuating the more leaden masses of the lesser boxes around it\\", while James Gardner of The Real Deal said that \\"the sense of pure geometry, the almost polemical denial of scale, only enhances the sense of immensity.\\" Conversely, the architecture critic for New York magazine, Justin Davidson, wrote that the building is nothing more than \\"stacked cubbyhole units\\" and questioned the creative value of the building. The fashion consultant Tim Gunn described the building as \\"just a thin column. It needs a little cap.\\" Some critics have cited 432 Park Avenue as a representation of New York's increasing cost of living and ostentatious wealth. A critic for the Los Angeles Times called the skyscraper an \\"architectural emblem of rising inequality\\", while New York magazine called the building's units \\"fancy prisons for billionaires\\". 432 Park's association to wealth inequality was also remarked upon by the building's own architect, Vi√±oly, who commented that \\"There are only two markets, ultraluxury and subsidized housing.\\" Even so, several residents of nearby buildings said that the influx of rich residents at 432 Park Avenue would increase the worth of their own properties. Though Vi√±oly and Macklowe were friends, they often insulted each other over the various perceived flaws in the design. Vi√±oly called Macklowe \\"a truck driver with an education in aesthetics\\", while Macklowe said that Vi√±oly's supertall design was motivated by \\"penis envy\\" among the city's developers, who were vying to build the tallest structures. In 2016, Vi√±oly reportedly joked that the design had a \\"couple of screw-ups\\", such as Macklowe's window frames, the placement of the restrooms, and Berke's interior design; he later apologized for his comments.

The book, music and lyrics are by Tom Shelton and Susan C. Hunter. In 1935 Carol Ryrie Brink wrote the Newbery Medal ‚Äîwinning novel,Caddie Woodlawn, based on the childhood of her grandmother, Caroline Woodhouse. She had collected the stories that her grandmother had often recounted of her adventures as a pioneer child settling the wilderness of western Wisconsin in the mid-1800s. It won the Newbery Medal in 1936.Carol Ryrie Brink In the musical, as in the original novel, Caddie, a high-spirited Wisconsin pioneer girl beloved by generations of readers, leads her willing siblings in a series of adventures, not always with the approval of her traditional Bostonian mother. Her father, however, encourages her antics, that she might thrive in the new, tougher ways of the west. In a climax, Caddie single-handedly diffuses a potentially deadly clash between the terrified settlers and the local Dakota tribe through a daring and dangerous act. But her action only deepens her conflict with her mother. Ultimately, Caddie learns invaluable lessons about reconciling the head-strong child she's been, and the responsible adult she is soon to be. Through it all, the sacredness of tradition‚Äîpassed from one generation to the next‚Äîis powerfully dramatized. As one wise friend tells Caddie: \\"families -- they're our link to forever, lass.\\" Background Tom and Susan wrote the book, music and lyrics to Caddie Woodlawn, which won the Landers Theatre national playwriting award.

He has been given the nickname Rencong of Aceh, after the traditional Acehnese weapon, for his bravery.  Biography   Early life  Nyak Arif was born in Ul√®√´ Lheu√´, Banda Aceh, Aceh, on 17 July 1899. He was the third of five siblings born to Chief of Sagi XXVII Mukim Teuku Nyak Banta and Cut Nyak Rayeuh; he also had five siblings from his father's two other wives. After graduating from elementary school in Banda Aceh, he moved to Bukittinggi, West Sumatra, to study at the teacher's college () there. In 1911 he was chosen as the new leader of Sagi XXVI Mukim, but due to his age Nyak Arif was represented by his father. Upon finishing his studies in Bukittinggi, Nyak Arif went to the leadership school for native Indonesians () in Banten on the island of Java. While at school, he demonstrated a dislike of the Dutch colonial government and their programs, at times disobeying commands from his teachers and refusing to take the allowance allocated to every Acehnese student outside of Aceh. After graduating in 1915, he returned to Aceh.  Entry to politics  Nyak Arif became active in politics beginning in 1919, when he joined the Nationaal Indische Party, a continuation of the original Indische Party founded by Ernest Douwes Dekker, Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo, and Ki Hajar Dewantara; he became the party's head in Aceh. He also founded the Acehnese Society () and led the Aceh branches of the Islamic Youth Group () and Sumatran Youth Group (). Beginning in this period he became an ardent supporter of the Taman Siswa and Muhammadiyah social organisations, which continued until his death. On 16 May 1927, Nyak Arif was selected to join the People's Council of Aceh () in addition to his duties as Chief of Sagi XXVII Mukim. As a member of the council he would consistently criticise Dutch policies which he found to go against the interests of the Acehnese people; in another speech he said that the Aceh War was far from over. On 27 January 1930, he joined the National Fraction (), led by Mohammad Husni Thamrin. Nyak Arif left the council in 1931. In 1935 Nyak Arif became the head of the Acehnese Football Association (). With the nationalist movement gaining steam and the Dutch occupied with Adolf Hitler's movements in Europe, Nyak Arif delivered a speech at a memorial service for Soetomo in 1938, which ended with the lines \\"By Allah, with Allah, for Allah. I promise to be faithful to my homeland, people, and religion, and to never betray the struggle.\\" This oath was taken by other attendees as well, including Daud Bereueh.  Japanese occupation  With Japanese forces approaching, on 8 March 1942 Nyak Arif joined several other Acehnese leaders in demanding self- determination. Three days later, eight of the leaders were arrested by Dutch forces by command of Colonel George Gosenson; Gosenson searched for Nyak Arif, but the latter was able to escape detection. The following day, on 12 March 1942, the Japanese forces landed at Sabang; this was followed on 28 March with the surrender of the Dutch troops. Nyak Arif was chosen by the Acehnese people to lead the Government Committee of Aceh, and reluctantly collaborated with the Japanese forces; he later said of the period, \\"we had driven out dogs only to have pigs come.\\" He was once arrested on the suspicion of leading an underground resistance force, but later released. When the Japanese formed their own people's representative council for Aceh, Nyak Arif was chosen as its head. In 1943 he went to Japan with 14 other Sumatran leaders and brought before Emperor of Japan Hirohito; he reportedly refused to bow before the emperor in the Japanese tradition, although he did agree to nod. Upon returning to Aceh, he and Teuku Hasan delivered a speech permeated with subtle sarcasm about the greatness of the Empire of Japan. In 1944 Nyak Arif was chosen to be deputy chief of the People's Representative Council of Sumatra.  Independence  After the Japanese surrender to the Allies and Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in 1945, on 3 October Nyak Arif was chosen to be the first resident of Aceh. In this position he oversaw the Japanese withdrawal from Aceh after refusing the Allies the right to do so; despite clashes with some Japanese troops in Bireu√´n, they were eventually all disarmed and returned to their homeland. On 17 January 1946 he was declared a titular major general while he served as a staff member to the Sumatran military commander. During the Cumbok Affair‚Äîa power struggle between the ulama (religious leaders) and ul√®√´balang (feudalists)‚ÄîNyak Arif agreed to surrender himself to the ulama to prevent further bloodshed. He died on 4 April of the same year as from complications from diabetes in Takengon and was buried in Lam Nyong family cemetery.  Accolades and honours  On 9 November 1974 Nyak Arif was declared a National Hero of Indonesia by President Suharto through Presidential Decree 071/TK/1974.  Personal life  Nyak Arif's first marriage was to the daughter of Teuku Maharaja, the chief of Lhokseumawe; the couple divorced before they had any children. His second marriage was to Jauhari, daughter of a Minang police officer named Yazid. Together they had two sons and a daughter.

Choi, 818 F. Supp. 2d 79 (D.D.C. 2011), was a federal criminal case in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. In November 2010, Choi and 12 other protesters chained themselves to the White House fence in protest of the military \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" policy, shouting \\"Let us serve.\\" All 13 were arrested and charged federally. Choi rejected a plea bargain deal, and trial commenced on August 29, 2011, before United States Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola. It was halted by the prosecution after three days to pursue a writ of mandamus prohibiting the defense of selective and vindictive prosecution. After the writ was issued, Choi was convicted of a single misdemeanor charge on March 28, 2013, and fined $100.  Charges  On November 15, 2010, a group of 13 gay-rights activists, including former Army Lieutenant Daniel \\"Dan\\" Choi stood on the masonry base of the White House fence and handcuffed themselves in protest of the military \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" policy. The policy barred openly gay, lesbian or bisexual service members from revealing their sexual orientation. The 13 were arrested and charged with \\"Failure to Obey a Lawful Order\\", a United States Park Police regulation, Title 36 C.F.R. Section 2.32(a)(2). At pre-trial hearings and conferences, prosecutors offered the group a wired plea deal. In return for pleading guilty to the charge, the group would have all charges dismissed after four months of no arrests upon probable cause. Choi refused to plead guilty, but the deal was offered to the other 12.  Trial  Trial commenced for Choi on August 29, 2011. Prosecutor Angela George filed a motion in limine asking the judge to prohibit the defenses of impossibility and selective prosecution. Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola ruled against this motion until the submission of all evidence at trial. Prosecution called witnesses from the United States Park Police including the arresting officer, Lieutenant Robert LaChance, who testified to the existence of Secret Service advance knowledge of the protest. Defense team led by Robert Feldman (pictured above) filed a motion to compel evidence of Secret Service emails and issued subpoena to directors of Homeland Security and the Department of the Interior. After Choi himself testified in the defense case, Judge Facciola made a prima facie finding for selective and vindictive prosecution. Prosecution petitioned for a writ of mandamus to prohibit Judge Facciola from entertaining the defense, and the trial was stayed.  Selective prosecution  Choi asserted pre-trial that the decision to federally prosecute the group of 13 protesters was selective enforcement of the regulations, noting a rally at the White House following the death of Osama bin Laden, where none of the revelers were arrested. Choi also asserted at trial that he was arrested two previous times, on March 18, 2010, and April 20, 2010, for the same conduct but charged at municipal court. During those prosecutions, all charges against Choi were dropped, without an official statement from the Washington D.C. Office of the Attorney General. Choi claimed the federal charges were a result of White House and prosecutor vindictiveness, to punish him for successfully asserting his constitutional rights to free speech. Choi pointed out that he was the only protester in history to stand federal trial for handcuffing himself to the White House fence. He claimed the wiring of the plea deal was an attempt to punish Choi although several of the others were never previously arrested. At trial, prosecution revealed an email between US Park Police detective Sgt. Timothy Hodge communicating with Department of Interior Solicitor Randolph Myers on prosecuting the group with federal charges. After evidence of White House LGBT Liaison Brian K. Bond alerting Secret Service, Homeland Security and US Park Police to the protest, three days prior, two of the 12 protesters withdrew their guilty pleas in order to stand trial with Choi. Their motions were denied by Magistrate Judge Alan Kay.  Interlocutory petition for mandamus  On October 7, 2011, a mandamus hearing was held, and on October 11 a federal district court chief judge granted a writ of mandamus against a magistrate judge of the same district court, for the first time in history. In his opinion, Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth expressed the rare nature of this action but granted the writ after finding the defense should have raised the selective and vindictive prosecution claim before trial. Judge Lamberth agreed with the prosecution's claim that responding to a selective prosecution claim would be too costly for the government. Choi appealed this decision to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and petitioned for a writ of mandamus prohibiting Judge Lamberth's writ of mandamus. He terminated his attorneys and proceeded pro se.  Re-enlistment in the military  During the course of the trial, the \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" policy was officially repealed and Choi, discharged under the policy in July 2010, attempted to re- enlist in the U.S. Army. However, he was told by recruiters that the federal trial prevented his re-enlistment.  Civil suit  Choi filed a civil suit against the United States Park Police and Secret Service for the wrongful arrest on November 14, 2011. He also filed conspiracy charges against White House officials involved in the arrest and subsequent federal charges.

His father Lysimachus ruled as the Ptolemaic Client King of Telmessos from February 240 BCE until his death in 206 BCE. Little is known on his early life prior to succeeding his father. When his father died in 206 BCE, Ptolemy II became the fourth and final ruler from the Lysimachid dynasty, which is also known as the Ptolemaic-Lysimachid dynasty in LyciaBillows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, pp. 103&229 to rule the city. Ptolemy II also, was the third and final Ptolemaic Client King of Telmessos, as he ruled from 206 BCE until at least 181 BCE. According to surviving inscriptions at Telmessos, Ptolemy II didn't seem to have a royal title nor is his relationship with the Pharaohs in Alexandria clear.Bagnall, The administration of the Ptolemaic possessions outside Egypt, p. 234 It seems likely that his family had relative autonomy from Ptolemaic control increased.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p. 102 As Ptolemaic power declined rapidly and dramatically outside of Egypt after the death of Ptolemy III Euergetes in 222 BCE, probably Ptolemy II's father with his family had the motive and opportunity for divorcing themselves from Ptolemaic suzerainty.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p. 102 At an unknown date, during his father's reign, Lysimachus with his family were enjoying excellent, cordial relations with the Seleucid monarch Antiochus III the Great.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p. 102 Antiochus III, reigned from 222 BCE until 187 BCE, was an enemy of the Ptolemies and was, at the time, expanding Seleucid power in Asia Minor.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p. 103 In 197 BCE, the region of Lycia was no longer under Ptolemaic control since it was under the occupation of Antiochus III.Cohen, The Hellenistic settlements in Europe, the Island, and Asia Minor, p. 330 Ptolemy II became a Client King of Telmessos under Seleucid rule. By this time Ptolemy II was having excellent relations with Antiochus III revealing they had broken away from Ptolemaic influence,Bagnall, The administration of the Ptolemaic possessions outside Egypt, p. 107 however there is a possibility their family connections with the Ptolemaic dynasty wasn't wholly broken. The friendly relations between Ptolemy II and his family with Antiochus III is attested when in 193 BCE, his daughter Berenice, was appointed by Antiochus III as chief-priestess of the Carian Satrapy,Bagnall, The administration of the Ptolemaic possessions outside Egypt, p. 107Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer, p. 85 of the Seleucid Royal Cult of Laodice.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p. 102 Laodice was a Seleucid Queen and the cousin-wife of Antiochus III.Bagnall, The Hellenistic Period: historical sources in translation, p. 259 According to an intact stone inscription found in Nahavand Iran dated in 193 BCE, Ptolemy II is described as a relative of Antiochus III.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\", Footnote 12 This reflects his court title and in fact, Ptolemy II and Antiochus III are distantly related.As mentioned above, Ptolemy II is descended from Cassander the brother of Antipater while Antiochus III is a direct descendant of Antipater.

The first letter is from Antiochus III addressed to the Strategos of the Carian Satrapy and is the above-mentioned stone inscription from Nahavand, Iran: : King Antiochus to Anaximbrotos, greeting. As we desire to increase still further the honors of our sister Queen Laodice, and we think this most important for ourselves because she not only lives with us lovingly and considerately but is also reverently disposed towards the divine, we continue to do lovingly the things which it is fitting and right for her to receive from us and we have decided that just as there are appointed throughout the kingdom chief priests of us, (so) there are to be established [in] the same districts chief priestesses of her also, who shall war golden crowns bearing her [images] and who shall be mentioned in [the] contracts alter the chief priests of our [ancestors] and of us. Since, therefore, the in districts under your administration Berenice, the daughter of our relative Ptolemy (son) of Lysimachus, has been appointed, carry everything out according to what has been written above and have copies of the letters, inscribed on stelae, set up in the most conspicuous places, so that both now and in the future there may be evident to all in these matters also our policy towards our sister. The second letter is addressed to the Hyparch of the district from the Strategos of the Carian satrapy: : [Anaxim]brotos to Dionytas, greeting. Enclosed is the copy of the decree written by the king concerning the appointment of Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy son of Lysimachus, as chief priestess of the queen of the satrapy. Carry out (the matter) according to the instructions, just as he enjoins, and see to it that copies, inscribed on a stone stele, are set up in the most conspicuous place. Farewell. Year 119, Artemisios 19. [May 9 193 BC] Around the time Berenice was appointed as chief-priestess, Ptolemy II sold part of his land holdings in the Telmessos region to Antiochus III. The reason for Antiochus III in purchasing part of Ptolemy II's land holdings were to settle Kardakian mercenaries near Telmessos.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p. 102 The Kardakian mercenaries were possible ancestors of the modern Kurds.Cohen, The Hellenistic settlements in Europe, the Island, and Asia Minor, pp. 330-331 During the Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC, Antiochus III was forced to give the region of Lycia to the King Eumenes II of Pergamon.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\", Footnote 12 In the Treaty of Apamea, Ptolemy II's position was explicitly safeguarded.Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer, p. 115 According to dedication inscriptions on the Greek island of Delos, Ptolemy II made offerings of thanks for the Peace of Apamea. This included an offering from Ptolemy II in association with his cousin Antipater Epigonos.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\", Footnote 12 From 188 BCE until at least 181 BCE, Ptolemy II became a Client King under the rule of Eumenes II. His relationship with Eumenes II is unknown; but, probably, Ptolemy II sided with RomeBillows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p. 103 as Eumenes II was an ally of Rome. Though Ptolemy II was able to retain his rule of Telmessos and his major land- holdings under Eumenes II, the family is not heard of thereafter.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p. 103 References Sources * Lysimachus‚Äô article at Livius.org * Ptolemaic Genealogy: Berenice I * Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\" * R.S.

The film stars Yash Pandit, Manjari Fadnis, Sunny Deol, Carran Kapur, Aparna Kumar and Ram Menon in the lead roles. The music was scored by Jatin Lalit.  Plot  There are two neighbouring high schools ‚Äì Bharti School, for the middle-class and Valley High School, for the affluent. Dev (Yash Pandit), Suhana (Manjari Fadnis), and their friends come from Bharti, and are often disturbed by their enemies who come from Valley High. The Valley High students also defeat the Bharti students in every single inter-school event that happens every year, which is the main reason why they make fun of Bharti. One day however, the Bharti students are saved from the Valley High students by a mysterious man Kabir Mukherjee (Sunny Deol), who they initially feared because of his rough looks, thereby the reason they always called him \\"Phantom\\". The Bharti students get close to Kabir and befriend him, and with time he also becomes more gentle and normal, thereby getting rid of his \\"Phantom\\" look. Dev, however gets attached to Sanjana (Aparna Kumar), a girl from Valley High, which results in him dropping Suhana. But Sanjana eventually rejects him because he once insulted her at a caf√© and because he belongs to the rival school. One day while driving in an open road, Dev and his friends are again insulted and considered \\"slow\\" by the Valley High students who are also driving on the same road. Dev drives faster and overtakes them, but the car quickly meets with an accident and crashes. Everyone in the car survives, except Kabir,who died while saving the young guys. This leaves the Bharti students dismayed and defenceless against the Valley High students, with whom they have an upcoming 100 metres race competition. Dev however is still determined, so he trains up and attends the race with full confidence. During the race, he gets injured by one of the runners, but does not lose hope and through last-minute strength, he eventually wins the race, thereby finally letting Bharti get their revenge on Valley High. Incidentally the prize for the winner is a bike similar to Kabir's, so Dev becomes the new \\"Phantom\\".

At the time, Eastern Idaho was one of the few places where homesteaders could claim productive farmland, as its climate had discouraged earlier settlement. The brothers built a farm on the land, reflecting the region's agricultural economy.Hibert, Renee. National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Hollingshead Homestead. National Park Service, January 2005. Eight buildings and four structures remain at the homestead. The brothers built their original log house, called the \\"chicken coop\\", when they first settled the homestead. In the early 1910s, the brothers constructed a new log house with a stone foundation. Around this time, the brothers also built a granary and horse barn. A smokehouse, a barn which later became a granary, a privy, and three grain bins were added in the 1930s. The last two buildings, a dwelling and a forge, were built in the 1950s using poteaux-sur-sol construction; the method, which uses vertical logs to form walls, is uncommon in Idaho.

In the game, Yu is a silent character whose thoughts and actions are decided by the player. He is portrayed as a high school student who moves to Inaba to live with his uncle and cousin while his parents are busy working. Shortly after arriving to Inaba, Yu starts investigating a murder case alongside his school mates and explores an alternate dimension where he obtains a power known as \\"Persona\\" to confront the \\"Shadows\\", the creatures who murdered the first victims. Yu has also appeared in other works related to Persona 4, including an anime adaptation called Persona 4: The Animation, a manga version, and several spin-off games. For these works, Yu received his own characterization and development in the stories. He is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and Johnny Yong Bosch in English. Yu was designed by Shigenori Soejima who aimed to create an ambiguous character who could appeal to most players by way of reflecting several feelings towards them and through his mannerisms. For the anime, director Seiji Kishi expressed difficulties in giving the character emotions without damaging what the original staff created. Nevertheless, Yu's characterization in the anime has been a subject of praise due to his portrayal as a mostly silent teenager whose few lines are related to the plot and in some cases, a source of comedy. Character creation and traits Early designs from the character including the \\"Baby Face\\" in the bottom Character designer Shigenori Soejima made Yu with the idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions. As a result, he wanted Yu to look more ambiguous than the protagonist of Persona 3. Soejima compared Yu to the Blue Ranger from the Power Rangers franchise as such character tends to stand silent to follow the orders from his leader. His character design stayed relatively similar to its initial conception, with his tone and facial expressions changing the most. The feature Soejima focused on most was his eyes: he thought that having his eyes under the fringe of his hair would make him \\"look cool.\\" The collar of his school uniform was made to stand a bit taller than other characters'. While designing the character, Soejima noted \\"the main character needs to be well-rounded enough to be likeable, but also needs that extra little something to make him stand out from the rest of the cast.\\" He made a \\"baby face\\" sketch of the character so that he and the staff could discover Yu's \\"special something\\" and discuss what would make him stand out as the protagonist. Yu's voice acting has been handled by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and Johnny Yong Bosch in English. Bosch felt uneasy about voicing Yu due to the fact he also voiced another character from the game, Tohru Adachi. However, when he initially learned that the protagonist would have very few lines, his worry evaporated. It was first planned that Yu's voice actor for the anime would be recast, because he and Adachi would begin to interact several more times. However, in the end Bosch remained as the voice of Yu to avoid disappointing the fans. In order to solve the problem of having both of his characters sound too similar, he decided to speak in a lower register for Yu. Differences in adaptations In the initial Persona 4 game, the main player-controlled character is known simply as the \\"Protagonist\\" or \\"Hero\\", whose name is decided by the player. The name \\"Yu Narukami\\" was first given to the character in the 2011 anime adaptation, Persona 4: The Animation, and has since been used in official games where the character is unable to be named by the player, beginning with Persona 4 Arena. Prior to this, he was given the name of S≈çji Seta in the game's manga adaptation. In an interview, game director Katsura Hashino drew attention to the way in which the Protagonist remains silent and emotionless throughout the game. This leaves the player to interpret the Protagonist's emotional reactions subjectively at any particular point. Hashino elaborated on this particular character trait becoming an obstacle for Persona 4: The Animations director Seiji Kishi, since the character would undoubtedly have to speak and show some level of emotion. In the same interview, Kishi admitted the difficulty of transitioning the silent Protagonist into the anime without destroying what Hashino had already established. A unique gesture of Yu's in the anime occurs when he unbuttons his school jacket when summoning a Persona for the first time. Kishi noted this as being a \\"key\\" moment of \\"opening something that was closed.\\" However, he refrained from explaining its deeper meaning, leaving it instead as something for the viewers to ponder and hence helping them enjoy the adaptation much more. Another aspect made possible in the anime was Yu's cool and composed nature during battle scenes. Hashino elaborated that it was possible to create such an attitude by having the fighting solely done by the Personas, thus establishing Yu as an emotionally strong character‚Äîsomething which \\"would have lost its significance if he was given a weapon.\\" Appearances In Persona 4 In Persona 4, Yu is a high school student who moves to the countryside of Inaba to live with his uncle Ryotaro Dojima and cousin Nanako Dojima for a year as a result of his parents working abroad, and attends Yasogami High School where he meets most of the game's cast. Upon learning of the Midnight Channel's connection with the murders in Inaba, Yu gains access to the TV world, where he investigates the case alongside his friends and is appointed as their leader as a result of his experience. There he awakens his initial Persona, , a swordsman wearing a black coat, which he uses to fight embodiements of humans' negative feelings, the Shadows. Yu also has the unique ability, which allows him to swap Personas for use in battle. This is tied with the Social Links ( in Japan) mechanic: each bond Yu makes with other characters grants him access to more and much stronger Personas, each named after one of the Major Arcana of the Tarot deck. Yu's own Arcana is The Fool, representing the group as a whole and personified by Izanagi, which later becomes the Judgement, when the Investigation Team realizes that Taro Namatame is not responsible for his actions and begin to seek out the real culprit behind the Inaba events (This bond is represented by the Persona in the anime). After closing the serial murder case, Yu learns he gained his powers from the goddess Izanami who had been posing as the Moel gas station attendant and aims to transform people into Shadows. Yu defeats Izanami by transforming Izanagi into , representing The World, thanks to the power he gained from his many friends through Social Links. He then returns to his hometown, saying farewell to his friends. In Persona 4 Arena In the fighting game Persona 4 Arena, set two months after the events of Persona 4, Yu returns to Inaba for a holiday reunion, but must go to the TV World alongside his remaining friends to investigate a fighting tournament promoted in the Midnight Channel, while finding some of their missing friends and acquires help from their predecessors, Kirijo Group's Shadow Operatives. As the group is unable to find the mastermind behind the competition, the Investigation Team and Shadow Operatives decides to search for him behind his kidnapping Aigis' older sister android Labrys. He fights using Izanagi, though during its strongest attack it transforms in Izanagi-no-Okami. His moveset was balanced for the sequel to make him more versatile as a result of comments regarding his character being too strong in the first game. The author behind Arenas manga, Aiyakyuu, said that Yu was his favorite character and that whenever he draws him he thinks \\"Yu is so cool!\\" Aiyakyuu also mentioned having trouble making the fight scene between Yu and Akihiko Sanada from Persona 3 as \\"Both characters wouldn't easily lose to anyone.\\" In Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, Yu reunites with both his friends and the Shadow Operatives to face a new threat of Shadows that appear in Inaba stealing powers from every Persona user and bring forth a second coming of Dark Hour. While Yu and his friends initially believe the culprit is a teenager with two split identities named Sho Minazuki, it is later revealed that the mastermind behind the fighting tournaments in the two Arena games is Kagutsuchi, a being that aims to destroy mankind. With help of his former enemy, Tohru Adachi, Yu manages to defeat Kagutsuchi, and helps Sho (who now lost his other half of his personality, despite finally gaining the ability to summon his half's Persona, Tsukuyomi) on how gain the trust of friendship through clashing their blades one last time before they depart in separate ways. Afterwards, Yu returns to his home and says goodbye to his friends. Persona 4 adaptations In the Persona 4 manga, he is named and is depicted as a distant but otherwise friendly teenager due having to move frequently as a result of his parents' changing careers. He is also a supporting character in the manga Persona 4: The Magician with the name of Yu Narukami. In the events of The Animation, Yu faces his own Shadow that reveals his repressed fear of moving away from Inaba and losing his friends, a fact that Yu accepts and acknowledges as the truth, enabling him to best Margaret in combat so he can face Izanami's true form. He later appears in Persona 4: The Golden Animation, which focuses on new events not featured in the previous series, showcasing some slight differences in personality from that of the previous series. In the live stage production, he was portrayed by Toru Baba and his name was chosen by the audience. He was later portrayed by Keisuke Minami in the Persona 4 Arena stage plays. Other games Yu appears alongside Persona 3's protagonist in the 2014 game, Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth, in which he joins forces with the cast of Persona 3 to escape the mysterious labyrinth that they have been trapped inside of, while at the same time working to restore the memories of the mysterious Zen and Rei. Yu also appears in the rhythm game, Persona 4: Dancing All Night, where his friend Rise Kujikawa asks for his help. Yu also appears in Square Enix's arcade card game Lord of Vermilion Re:2 as a summon spell. He also appears in the fighting game BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle. He appears as a costume for the Mii characters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/04/17/super-smash-bros-ultimate- joker-joins-roster-on-april-17 Yu also appears in the mobile game Star Ocean: Anamnesis as part of a cross over with the Persona series.https://www.dualshockers.com/persona-kasumi-star-ocean-anamnesis- collab-tgs/ Yu appears as a DLC boss fight in Persona 5 Royal.http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/10/persona_5_royal_reveals_my_palace_mode_previous_persona_protagonists_as_dlc_bosses Reception Yu's character has generally been well received. His role has been noted for allowing the player to build a unique \\"self\\" during the game while questioning their real-life identity. Additionally, the protagonist's relationships with his relatives with whom he starts living were praised for adding more variants to the relationships with these ones focusing on family relationships. Kotaku's Jason Schreier got to call him \\"suave, handsome, and charming. He's friends with everyone, all the girls want to be with him, and in general, he's just an all-around badass.\\" The character's role in the anime adaptation of Persona 4 earned similar response. A reviewer from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews commented that Yu \\"seems to be the aggregate of all the quirkiest possible choices you could make in the game,\\" making him a likable character for his diverse scenes. When first watching the Persona 4 anime, Elliot Page from UK Anime Network noted that although Yu was not a silent character as in the video game, he had little dialogue and the pacing managed to make up for it. In a later review, Andy Hanley from the same site said he liked how the protagonist was handled, as the staff used his \\"blank state\\" to create comedic interactions. Briana Lawrence from the Fandom Post shared similar feelings, stating that the staff \\"somehow managed to give a silent protagonist a personality that's not only believable, but likable.\\" Lawrence appreciated how the character was developed across the series thanks to all the bonds he forms into a \\"snarky, lovable main character who can keep a straight face while being kicked off a cliff.\\" While also commenting how Yu manages to reinforce both the comical and \\"spooky\\" elements of the plot, Blu- ray's Jeffrey Kauffman noted he \\"remains something of a cipher throughout the series\\" with the possibility of having the viewer relate with him. In regards to his characterization in Golden The Animation, Narukami's social life was noted to be entertaining by Otaku USA and Anime Inferno although both reviewers were mixed in regards to its importance to viewers and balance it has with the more serious episodes. In contrast to most reviewers, Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku had mixed opinions about the character. Calling him \\"one of the oddest characters in any work of fiction ever\\", Eisenbeis found that his lack of backstory made it difficult for the viewer to predict his actions. However, he noted that, as well as being entertaining to watch, by the series' end, Yu had \\"become a character in his own right.\\" However, he criticised Yu's characterization in Persona 4 Arena and its sequel for being a stereotypical lawful-good hero and less than a bland compared to the new character Sho Minazuki and Rise's development. Additionally, he was rated sixth in the category \\"Best Male Character\\" from the Newtype anime awards from 2012.

It is unusual among bivalves in being carnivorous. It is found in more northerly parts of the Atlantic Ocean. Description Poromya granulata is a dull-white coloured shell with dome- shaped valves and grows to about long. The valves are thin and fragile, subequivalve and subequilateral. They are roughly oval in shape with a rounded anterior margin and a subtruncated, sloping posterior margin. The umbones are prominent. The surfaces of the valves have faint concentric sculpture lines and are covered in rows of fine granulations. The margins are smooth and the ligament is mostly internal. The right valve has a single cardinal tooth and the left valve has a ridge-like lateral tooth and a socket for the cardinal from the right valve. The inside of the valves is nacreous and the pallial line has a broad, shallow sinus.Poromya granulata (Nyst & Westendorp, 1839) Marine bivalve shells of the British Isles. Retrieved 2012-01-13. Distribution and habitat Poromya granulata has a subarctic and boreal distribution on either side of the North Atlantic Ocean. Around the British Isles it is commoner in the north. Off the North American coast its range extends as far south as the West Indies. It is usually found partially buried in the sandy seabed at ocean depths ranging from to , on the continental shelf and marginal zone. Biology Unlike the majority of bivalve molluscs, Poromya granulata is a carnivore.The Bivalve, Poromya granulata Archerd Shell Collection. Retrieved 2012-01-13. It mostly feeds on small crustaceans but is also a scavenger. The inhalent siphon is enlarged and modified into a cowl- shaped organ that can catch prey. Water is drawn in through this siphon and pumped out of the small, exhalent siphon. The large siphon can be retracted rapidly when it has trapped an item of food. In doing so it turns itself inside out and conveys the food to the mouth. This is an opening in the mantle and leads to a gizzard, where the food is ground up before passing into the gut, which is adapted to receive large items of food. The fringe of tentacles round the siphons have sensory cilia which are believed to alert the animal to the presence of moving prey in the vicinity. The blood contains red amoebocytes containing haemoglobin.

It is significant for its large scale and unorthodox adaptation of architectural styles, as well as its historical importance to Oneida County, which once was among the most populated counties in Idaho. It is, along with six other buildings in Oneida County, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Physical Description Exterior The exterior tabernacle is largely unchanged from its original appearance: the only modifications are the replacement of the wood-framed doors with metal-framed doors and the addition of metal railing to the entry steps, as well as minor work done in 1985. The one tall story of the red-brick building has a double-pitched end-gabled roof and rests on an elevated \\"look-out\\" basement. A parapeted, square corner tower (a tower set into the corner of a building) with white stone trim, which contains the main entrance, is outset from the Northeast corner of the building. The fa√ßade is also elaborated by a parapeted gable, also trimmed with white stone, and also with a molded belt course which follows the angle of the gable. A large tripartite (divided into three sections) window of primarily green stained glass centered in fa√ßade is round-headed, as are each of its three major sections. A white stone trim employing a stepped voussoir and a keystone motif is repeated above this window, the blind arches of the tower, and above the fan-lights over the front and side entrances. These entrances also have gabled overdoors, supported by volute-carved white wooden brackets. Interior History At the time the Malad Second Ward Tabernacle was constructed, Malad City was an important commercial center between the Salt Lake Valley in Utah and Butte, Montana. The railroad had arrived in Malad in 1906 and the population of the city would double in the next fifteen years. The tabernacle was designed by M. E. Anderson, an architect living in Brigham City, Utah at the time. A number of individual businessmen and other members of the community contributed to the construction of the building. The completion of the impressive structure was much anticipated by the Mormon residents of Malad, and its progress was well reported in Malad's Idaho Enterprise, a contemporary local newspaper (the tabernacle made the front page of the newspaper several times). At the time of its completion, the tabernacle was surrounded by fields near the railroad station. The wood-framed doors were eventually replaced by metal-framed glass doors, and metal rails were added to the entry steps, probably in 1949. On July 27, 1979, after a nomination by the Idaho State Historical Society, the tabernacle was added to the National Register of Historic Places for \\"its ambitious scale and interesting adaptation of styles\\" and its \\"special significance within its particular community.\\" At this time several large trees had grown up on the tabernacle grounds which are no longer there today. In 1985, minor work was done which did not significantly affect the structure of the tabernacle. The building once served as a Latter-Day Saint stake center, but that function has now been taken up by a different building and the Malad Second Ward Tabernacle currently operates as a normal meetinghouse, serving the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Wards.

The Brkini region is divided among the municipalities of Hrpelje-Kozina, Pivka, Ilirska Bistrica, and Divaƒça. The region is long and wide, and covers an area of . Its central part is high. The center of the region is the village of Pregarje. The climate is mild, and the geological basis is flyschy, with a minor limestone part in the northeast. The region is a link between the Mediterranean and the continental part of Slovenia. Name The name Brkini is believed to be of Italian origin because of the suffixation pattern. This indicates that the root of the name (brk-) may be derived from northern Italian bricco, bricca '(steep) slope'. Derivation from the Slavic noun brdo 'hill' is doubtful. Economy The Brkini Hills are an economically underdeveloped region, with the main economic activity being fruit farming, in particular plums. Many people from the Brkini Hills commute to work to the nearby centers of Ilirska Bistrica, Podgrad, Hrpelje, and Kozina. During World War II, over one-third of the villages in the Brkini Hills were burned by Italian and German forces due to Partisan activity in the area, which significantly affected the development of the region.

Biography He was born on April 30, 1897 to Christopher Miner Spencer (1833-1922), the inventor of, among other things, the Spencer repeating rifle. The then 14-year-old Spencer built his first pontooned hang glider in April 1911 from plans he found in a Popular Mechanics magazine. On May 15, 1914, Spencer made his first powered flight in a Curtiss flying boat. In 1929, he broke the light airplane altitude record‚Äî‚Äîpiloting a Curtiss Robin monoplane. Spencer was the president of Amphibians Inc. for three years selling amphibian designs. In 1937, he joined Sikorsky engineer Victor A. Larsen to form the Spencer-Larsen Aircraft Corporation and design their first, and only, amphibious aircraft, the Spencer-Larsen SL-12C. Development of the plane progressed slowly and in September 1940, Spencer left the partnership to form his own company, the Spencer Aircraft Company. His resulting design was the Spencer S-12 Air Car Amphibian. Construction began on March 1, 1941. The small, two-seat S-12 prototype, registration NX29098, made its first flight on August 8, 1941. The S-12 was a fabric-covered amphibian with a unique boxlike forward cabin; a high wing with a two-bladed propeller in pusher configuration; and a long, slender tail boom. In December 1941, Spencer put the Air Car into storage and joined the war effort as a test pilot for the Republic Aircraft Corporation. By 1943, he had flight tested 134 of the company's P-47 Thunderbolts. In April 1943, Spencer left Republic Aircraft for the Mills Novelty Company of Chicago, Illinois, which wanted to use his Air Car to promote the company. Spencer used the company's wood forming equipment to build a new egg-shaped cabin for the Air Car and began demonstrating the aircraft to his former employers, Republic Aircraft. Seeing the potential of the Air Car as the perfect sports plane for pilots returning from the war, Republic purchased the rights to the Air Car in December 1943 and immediately began development of an all-metal version designated the Model RC-1 Thunderbolt Amphibian. On November 30, 1944, the first RC-1 Thunderbolt Amphibian, registered NX41816, made its first flight with Spencer at the controls. The design led to the Republic RC-3 Seabee. On November 22, 1945, the prototype RC-3 (NX87451) came off the assembly line at Republic's factory in Farmingdale, New York, and on December 1 made its first flight in Farmingdale with Spencer at the controls. In 1968, Spencer and retired United States Air Force Colonel Dale L. \\"Andy\\" Anderson formed a new company to market a four-place amphibious homebuilt design once again called the Spencer Amphibian Air Car, with S-12C, S-12D, and S-12E, and S-14 variants. The first example was test flown in 1970 in Chino, California. The unit had a build cost of $8700.00. The S-12-D Aircar was an improved and larger four-seat aircraft, which retains the basic layout of the Seabee. The two-seat S-14 used advanced composites and was test flown by Spencer in 1983 at the age of 86. Its design did not meet expectations and the sole example was donated to the Experimental Aircraft Association Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Spencer died at a nursing home in Torrance, California in 1995, aged 97.

The church was built in 1888-89 for Albion's Methodist congregation, which was established in 1878. The church's design is typical of vernacular rural churches built in Idaho at the time, featuring a gable front with a small belfry and a one-room interior. When the church opened, it became Albion's first institutional building; it remained one of the city's few public buildings for much of its early history and hosted other churches' services, public meetings, and classes at the Albion State Normal School. The church remained open through 1951, when it closed due to its inability to maintain an active congregation in a small town with a majority Mormon population. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1986.
